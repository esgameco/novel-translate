        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Shu Fei saw that Ying Zheng's anger had not subsided, so she lit an incense that calms the mind and soothes the spirit.</p><p></p><p>The faint fragrance gradually spread throughout the room, making people feel relaxed and at ease.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, don't be angry. Anger greatly harms the body. Your Majesty's body is worth ten thousand gold pieces. If you ruin your health because of those petty people, it would be too unworthy," Shu Fei gently persuaded.</p><p></p><p>She was not persuading Ying Zheng to ignore this matter, but was worried about his health.</p><p></p><p>As the ruler of a country, working day and night on state affairs was already enough to harm the body.</p><p></p><p>If he got furious again, it would really damage his health.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Shu Fei's persuasion, Ying Zheng knew she meant well and nodded to indicate that he understood.</p><p></p><p>He still had many things to accomplish and hoped to live a long life in the future. He could not let these people affect his health.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Luo network was still useful now, and he could not uproot it yet.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to find out whether it was Zhao Gao alone who was making trouble, or if the entire Luo network was following him in making trouble.</p><p></p><p>Or whether there were other people behind Zhao Gao...</p><p></p><p>These were all unknown mysteries. Before grasping the exact situation, he could not act rashly.</p><p></p><p>The Luo network involved the internal forces of the Qin state and was very complex. It still needed long-term planning.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Ying Zheng decided to put these matters aside for the time being and focus on dealing with today's memorials.</p><p></p><p>He took out the neatly stacked bamboo slips and began to read them carefully.</p><p></p><p>For a while, only the rustling sound of turning bamboo slips could be heard in the palace.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the bamboo slips he had read were piled up on one side, like a small mountain.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen used his spiritual sense to see Ying Zheng reviewing the memorials, and then recalled the cartload of bamboo slips he had seen.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>[No wonder they all say Zheng was worked to death. These bamboo slips are piled up like a small mountain. It seems being an emperor is not all good.]</p><p></p><p>[If there was paper, it would be great. It's simple to write on, convenient to carry, and can save resources.]</p><p></p><p>Hearing his inner thoughts, Ying Zheng's movements paused slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Paper"? What kind of thing was that?</p><p></p><p>It sounded pretty good.</p><p></p><p>Hmm? There were still good things in the world that he didn't know about?</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Ying Zheng himself also felt that bamboo slips were inconvenient.</p><p></p><p>Not only did they take up a lot of space, but they were also heavy to pick up.</p><p></p><p>After a day of reviewing memorials, his wrists would be sore and stiff, sometimes to the point of being unable to move.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, manufacturing a batch of bamboo slips also required a lot of manpower and resources.</p><p></p><p>If that "paper" mentioned in the child's thoughts really had so many advantages, that would be great.</p><p></p><p>Simple to write on and convenient to carry - it would simply be the writing material favored by all scholars in the world!</p><p></p><p>However, this so-called "paper" must be very precious, right?</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how come in so many years, even as the ruler of a country, he had never heard of it?</p><p></p><p>Sure, here's the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Could it be something more precious than gold?</p><p></p><p>How could he obtain this thing then?</p><p></p><p>Shu Fei thought Ying Zheng was tired, so she gently massaged his back for him.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, if you're tired, please take a rest. Your health is of utmost importance."</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng stretched his sore wrists and sighed, as if unintentionally, "Writing on bamboo slips is so inconvenient. It would be great if there was something more convenient."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his gaze swept over Shu Fei's abdomen, intentionally or unintentionally, and he sighed, "Unfortunately, I don't know how to make it."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ying Zheng say this, Ying Chen subconsciously thought of the ancient method of papermaking.</p><p></p><p>[Making paper is simple. Just boil tree bark, rags, and hemp, then pound them into a pulp, use a mat to scoop it out into thin sheets, and let them dry.]</p><p></p><p>[By the way, I remember Meng Tian was known as the "Ancestor of the Brush". I wonder if he has finished improving his writing brush?]</p><p></p><p>[With paper and the improved brush, writing efficiency will greatly increase.]</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng was overjoyed to hear this inner voice.</p><p></p><p>So paper wasn't a precious thing after all!</p><p></p><p>It could be made from such common and simple materials?!</p><p></p><p>Compared to bamboo slips, the materials used were even worthless.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the papermaking process didn't sound as complicated as he had imagined, and seemed very easy to learn.</p><p></p><p>The materials were cheap, and its use was so convenient. There was actually such a wonderful thing in the world!</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, he must obtain this so-called paper!</p><p></p><p>If it could be mass-produced, he would never have to use bamboo slips again!</p><p></p><p>The memorials from the officials could all be changed to paper. How convenient would that be!</p><p></p><p>As for the person to make the paper, he had already decided.</p><p></p><p>Since this child said Meng Tian had already started improving the writing brush, the task of making paper must be given to Meng Tian!</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that the rough-looking Meng Tian was actually secretly improving the writing brush behind his back?</p><p></p><p>Since he could improve the writing brush, making paper should be a piece of cake for him.</p><p></p><p>The day he could use paper was just around the corner!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Ying Zheng became extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>He felt that he must find Meng Tian as soon as possible and assign this task to him.</p><p></p><p>The sooner he told Meng Tian about this, the sooner he could use the legendary paper with its many benefits.</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Ying Zheng gained a lot of motivation, and his speed of reviewing memorials increased significantly!</p><p></p><p>After finishing the memorials for the day, he took his people and left the palace, heading towards Meng Tian's residence.</p><p></p><p>PS: 10 updates every day.

        <h1>Chapter 36</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the area outside the Shi Ya Prison, Chi Lian and the others were still unaware of what had happened inside.</p><p></p><p>They were anxiously waiting, ready to support Wai Zhuang at any moment when he came out.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Bai Feng descended from a high place and said with a grim face, "Someone has come out of the Shi Ya Prison, but it's not Lord Wai Zhuang!"</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian's face greatly changed.</p><p></p><p>How could this be?</p><p></p><p>If the person coming out at this time wasn't Wai Zhuang, did that mean he had already encountered danger?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chi Lian's unsightly expression, Bai Feng suggested to everyone, "Let's all hide first and see the specific situation before we make plans."</p><p></p><p>Although everyone was very worried about Wai Zhuang's situation, there was no better way at the moment, so they could only do this.</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian stood out and said, "No, Zhuang must have encountered danger. I'm going down to find him."</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian's idea was immediately opposed by Bai Feng.</p><p></p><p>"If you go down now, you'll run into those people of unknown origin. You're not going to find him, but courting death."</p><p></p><p>What Bai Feng said was unpleasant to hear, but it was indeed the truth.</p><p></p><p>The others also pulled Chi Lian back and tried to persuade him.</p><p></p><p>"We're just temporarily assessing the situation. Don't be impulsive."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, once we've ascertained the situation, we can go down together."</p><p></p><p>"You're not the only one who's worried. We're also concerned, so don't act rashly."</p><p></p><p>Everyone spoke one after another, and finally managed to dissuade Chi Lian.</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian finally agreed not to act impulsively, but to act together with everyone.</p><p></p><p>After reaching a consensus, they quickly left the original place they were staying.</p><p></p><p>Finding a high place, they waited for the people to come.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the people Bai Feng saw from afar arrived.</p><p></p><p>It was Zhang Heng, Yue Shen and the others.</p><p></p><p>After circling around the vicinity a few times, Zhang Heng and the Yin-Yang family discovered some unusual traces.</p><p></p><p>Those were the traces that Chi Lian and the others didn't have time to eliminate because they left in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>Xing Hun said, "It's obvious they haven't gone far. What should we do? Should we chase them?"</p><p></p><p>After having Shadow Secret Guards check the surroundings, Zhang Heng shook his head and said, "The people of Liu Sha are not weak. They can't be dealt with in a short time. Since we couldn't catch up, it will be difficult to catch up."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go. We need to report back to His Majesty as soon as possible. This matter is more important."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Heng wished he could fly back immediately to tell the emperor the news about the Luo Web that he learned.</p><p></p><p>Yue Shen and the others naturally didn't care.</p><p></p><p>In any case, the order they received was to deal with Wai Zhuang, who appeared in the Shi Ya Prison with the intention of breaking the jail.</p><p></p><p>Now that the mission was completed, there was no need to pursue relentlessly.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Heng and the Yin-Yang family people thus reached a consensus and left.</p><p></p><p>After confirming their departure, Chi Lian and the others</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They had already heard the conversation just now. </p><p></p><p>Zhang Han and the others already knew that the Flowing Sand organization was here.</p><p></p><p>The truth itself represented bad news.</p><p></p><p>Bai Feng sighed, "It seems Lord Wei Zhuang has already fallen into it."</p><p></p><p>This was the most reasonable speculation.</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian's eyes were full of hatred as her nails dug deeply into her palms. She said hatefully, "Why are there so many experts from the Yin-Yang family here?!"</p><p></p><p>Doesn't the Yin-Yang family not show up easily unless there is a big event? </p><p></p><p>How come this time they are so attentive, dispatching so many people from the Yin-Yang family in such a remote place?</p><p></p><p>One couldn't help but suspect that they had received some information and had ambushed here in advance.</p><p></p><p>The Wolf King, Yin Fu and the others quickly began to suspect Luo Wang.</p><p></p><p>The only one who knew they were here was Luo Wang.</p><p></p><p>There was a high possibility that Luo Wang had leaked their information.</p><p></p><p>If Luo Wang hadn't betrayed them, how could these experts happen to be at Shi Ya Prison?</p><p></p><p>Thinking carefully, perhaps Luo Wang's proposal to cooperate with them from the beginning was a complete trap!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could Mo Yu Qilin fail so easily? </p><p></p><p>It must be that they leaked intelligence, schemed against Qilin, and then lured them to save her!</p><p></p><p>The Flowing Sand people felt they had guessed the so-called truth.</p><p></p><p>For a while, they felt extremely frightened.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Wei Zhuang insisting on going alone and letting them stay behind,</p><p></p><p>then the Flowing Sand group would probably have been wiped out, and everyone would be locked up in Shi Ya Prison.</p><p></p><p>Then there would be no hope at all!</p><p></p><p>Luo Wang, and Ying Zheng behind them, would have achieved their goal!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the anger in Chi Lian's heart could not be suppressed at all.</p><p></p><p>She took out the soft sword from her waist and directly smashed a giant rock as tall as a person to pieces!</p><p></p><p>"Luo Wang is despicable and shameless! How dare they scheme against us like this! Don't let me catch them, otherwise I will definitely let the Luo Wang crowd taste my poison and suffer to death!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was silent.</p><p></p><p>Their angry mood at this time was no less than Chi Lian's.</p><p></p><p>It's just that they were still desperately maintaining their reason.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a figure appeared silently from behind the Flowing Sand crowd and sighed, "It seems I am still a step too late."</p><p></p><p>This person was none other than Zhang Liang who came to seek cooperation.</p><p></p><p>Just from the few people's brief words, he had already guessed the truth.</p><p></p><p>Hearing someone speaking behind them, the Flowing Sand crowd was shocked!</p><p></p><p>They were actually approached so closely by someone without noticing?!</p>

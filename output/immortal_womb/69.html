        <h1>Chapter 69</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Just as Qin was gathering experts, preparing to annihilate the Mohists.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng suddenly received important news from the palace.</p><p></p><p>Shu Fei's child was about to be born!</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this news, Ying Zheng couldn't even be bothered about the Mohists and ran straight to Shu Fei's palace.</p><p></p><p>What Mohists? How could they be more important than this child?</p><p></p><p>Shu Fei was currently less than seven months pregnant, how could she be giving birth now?!</p><p></p><p>Could there be any problems?</p><p></p><p>Could it be the impact of the assassin incident last time?</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng was extremely anxious, fearing that there would be problems with the child.</p><p></p><p>He rushed into Shu Fei's palace like a whirlwind.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered, Ying Zheng heard Ying Chen's inner voice.</p><p></p><p>[Is this prince finally going to be born? Although it's a bit early, I can't wait any longer.]</p><p></p><p>[Fortunately, the Imperial Extreme Dao Sutra has broken through to the Imperial Qi Foundation Establishment realm. In a moment, I can recast my flesh and grow rapidly. I hope Brother Zheng won't be shocked.]</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng was stunned upon hearing the inner voice, standing still on the spot.</p><p></p><p>This brat has already reached this level while still in his mother's womb?</p><p></p><p>Not only did he anticipate his own birth.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, recasting flesh and growing rapidly?!</p><p></p><p>He can even do such things?</p><p></p><p>What does it mean? Is he preparing to grow up immediately after being born?</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng couldn't help but imagine a baby growing into a child immediately after landing.</p><p></p><p>This... if someone saw this, wouldn't they be scared to death?</p><p></p><p>It's only him who can always hear his son's inner voice and know his great abilities.</p><p></p><p>If it were someone else, they would definitely not be able to understand.</p><p></p><p>No, this matter must be kept secret!</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng began to ponder whether it was feasible to conceal the existence of this child.</p><p></p><p>First, this child already has his own intelligence.</p><p></p><p>He already knows that he is Shu Fei's child and may not be willing to leave Shu Fei's side.</p><p></p><p>The second is the key issue of identity.</p><p></p><p>He must bring this child to his side to raise him. When a child of unknown age suddenly appears by his side, how should he explain it to the people around him?</p><p></p><p>He is fearless of others' rumors, but doing so would not be good for the child's future, and many people would doubt his identity.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the future, this son of his will definitely be a stunning talent, and no one will be able to obscure his brilliance.</p><p></p><p>At that time, when he wants to hand over Qin to this son, the lack of a clear identity will be another trouble.</p><p></p><p>After much thought, hiding this child is not beneficial after all.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng was troubled by his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he gave up on this idea.</p><p></p><p>It's better to just let nature take its course and directly expose the growth process of this son.</p><p></p><p>Doing so will certainly cause the world to be shocked and astonished,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>But after a period of time, everyone will get used to it. </p><p></p><p>Just like when he first heard his son's inner voice.</p><p></p><p>And as the son of him, the First Emperor, of course it's better to show more extraordinary abilities.</p><p></p><p>Giving him an innately sacred title will make it even more apparent that our Great Qin is favored by heaven and has the Mandate of Heaven. Isn't this very good?</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Ying Zheng made a decision in his heart. </p><p></p><p>No more hiding! He wants to openly announce to the world that this is his son! The future of Great Qin!</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ying Zheng standing still for a long time, Zhang Han reminded: "Your Majesty, the other concubines in the harem have now all sent their spies to come observe. Should we drive them away?"</p><p></p><p>The corners of Ying Zheng's mouth revealed a hint of a cold smile. </p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the news, this group of people ran faster than him, the birth father.</p><p></p><p>The abacus in their hearts is moving too fast, they don't even have time to pretend on the surface anymore.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng waved his hand: "No need to bother, just let them watch! Let them have a good look! It's just that I hope they won't be scared later."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ying Zheng's reply, Zhang Han was puzzled. </p><p></p><p>What does that mean? Why would they be scared? </p><p></p><p>Could it be that Concubine Shu's child will be very shocking?</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng summoned the imperial physicians and instructed them to ensure that Concubine Shu's delivery goes smoothly this time.</p><p></p><p>The imperial physicians repeatedly agreed and then went to make preparations.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a series of exclamations suddenly sounded from outside.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, look at the sky, what is that?!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the sound, Ying Zheng immediately strode out of the palace with Zhang Han following closely behind.</p><p></p><p>The two raised their heads and looked towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Only to see in the azure sky, a large patch of golden spots converging from all directions. </p><p></p><p>Then they stopped above Concubine Shu's palace, circling, and finally formed a huge golden vortex.</p><p></p><p>The center of the vortex was right above Concubine Shu's bedchamber.  </p><p></p><p>Such a stunning celestial phenomenon can be said to be unprecedented in so many years!</p><p></p><p>Everyone was shocked to the point of numbness by this sight. They stood still, unable to move their gaze away.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han opened his eyes wide, his gaze chasing the golden spots. He could feel that the spots contained a powerful force.</p><p></p><p>"This is... a vortex of primordial qi? No, this is no ordinary force of heaven and earth!"</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the scene before him had already exceeded Zhang Han's knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng stared at the scene with burning eyes. </p><p></p><p>Suddenly inspired, he thought of the word that often appeared in his son's inner voice. He exclaimed excitedly: "It's not primordial qi, this is imperial qi!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han looked at Concubine Shu's bedchamber, then at Ying Zheng. He was shocked in his heart. Could this be what His Majesty meant just now? </p><p></p><p>He had long known that the birth of this child would cause a big commotion?</p>

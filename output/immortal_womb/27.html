        <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the Xianyang Palace, the lights were bright.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng rubbed his brow and leaned back in his chair, closing his eyes to rest.</p><p></p><p>He had just finished dealing with military affairs and was feeling tired.</p><p></p><p>The Northern Barbarians were harassing the border, and he planned to send out Meng Tian. He would lead the army north to guard the border in a few days.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhang Han appeared and reported: "Your Majesty, the Shadow Guards have just captured a person who intruded into the rear palace. It seems to be Mo Yuqilin of the Flowing Sand Organization."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Ying Zheng opened his eyes and sat up straight.</p><p></p><p>How could Mo Yuqilin of the Flowing Sand Organization be in the palace?!</p><p></p><p>He knew of Mo Yuqilin's great reputation.</p><p></p><p>He was the number one assassin in the Han Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>This person had no form or appearance, yet could transform into all living beings. Until now, no one knew his true identity.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng's gaze fell on Zhang Han, and he asked, "Isn't this person said to be able to enter anywhere? How did you manage to catch him?"</p><p></p><p>In his words, disbelief was mixed with a little pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>When did his Shadow Guards become so capable?</p><p></p><p>They caught a big fish without making a sound!</p><p></p><p>Hearing the emperor's words, Zhang Han's expression was strange, but he still reported truthfully: "Actually, when we caught her, she was already unconscious."</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng was stunned, not quite understanding the meaning.</p><p></p><p>"Already unconscious when caught? What's going on? It wasn't you who made a move? Then who did?"</p><p></p><p>Speaking of this, Zhang Han was extremely ashamed.</p><p></p><p>So many Shadow Guards, yet not a single one clearly saw who made the move.</p><p></p><p>He knelt down, lowered his head, and pleaded for forgiveness: "Please forgive me, Your Majesty, this... your subordinate does not know."</p><p></p><p>In the rear palace, someone had already made a move.</p><p></p><p>Especially to silently beat Mo Yuqilin, such a highly skilled person, into this state.</p><p></p><p>Yet he had no idea. As the commander of the Shadow Guards, this was indeed his undeniable dereliction of duty.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng's heart stirred, and a absurd idea suddenly popped into his mind.</p><p></p><p>This Mo Yuqilin was rendered unconscious by someone in the rear palace.</p><p></p><p>He was familiar with his rear palace; there shouldn't be such a highly skilled person.</p><p></p><p>Could this matter be related to that stinky boy?</p><p></p><p>Was it he who dealt with Mo Yuqilin?</p><p></p><p>After all, he already had wisdom and had acquired martial arts.</p><p></p><p>If that were the case, it would make sense that Zhang Han and his Shadow Guards didn't discover any traces.</p><p></p><p>Somehow, even though this guess was quite unreliable,</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng just had an inexplicable certainty.</p><p></p><p>There was an eighty to ninety percent chance that this matter was related to his son.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Ying Zheng pardoned Zhang Han's crime and said, "Go and bring Mo Yuqilin up."</p><p></p><p>He wanted to interrogate personally.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the emperor had no intention of blaming him, Zhang Han immediately thanked him for his grace and withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Before long</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The weakened Moyu Qilin was brought up, currently tied up and looking miserable all over.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng interrogated: "Moyu Qilin, who sent you here?" </p><p></p><p>Facing Ying Zheng's questioning, Moyu Qilin did not answer, but instead tried to sow discord: "Do you know there is an extremely powerful person hidden in your harem?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhang Han's face greatly changed.</p><p></p><p>Moyu Qilin's implication was that the person who injured her did not come from outside the palace.</p><p></p><p>But had been hiding inside the palace all along. </p><p></p><p>Yet their Shadow Guards had no idea such a person existed!</p><p></p><p>This almost directly pointed at the Shadow Guards, implying they were all useless!</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han angrily rebuked Moyu Qilin: "Nonsense!"</p><p></p><p>Moyu Qilin laughed bitterly: "Then who do you think injured me?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han was stunned. </p><p></p><p>He had to admit, Moyu Qilin was an expert, not just anyone could heavily injure her.</p><p></p><p>Especially with hardly any traces left at the scene.</p><p></p><p>It strongly suggested this person was most likely someone who had long been concealed in the harem.</p><p></p><p>Familiar with the harem situation, so they could directly leave after injuring someone without leaving traces.</p><p></p><p>Realizing all this, Zhang Han turned pale and knelt down to apologize to the emperor.</p><p></p><p>But to Zhang Han and Moyu Qilin's surprise, Ying Zheng's expression remained normal.</p><p></p><p>When Moyu Qilin brought up that possibility, he showed no reaction of surprise.</p><p></p><p>As if he didn't care at all about this person possibly hiding in the harem.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng's gaze was calm as he glanced at Zhang Han, signaling him to stand up.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han stood and retreated to the emperor's side.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng paced over to Moyu Qilin, his bearing as unperturbed as always.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you don't say it, I know, behind you is Flowing Sand, Wei Zhuang is getting bolder and bolder, daring to even intrude my harem."</p><p></p><p>"The only thing I'm curious about is, why? What does Wei Zhuang want to do?"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning the Flowing Sand organization behind her, as well as Wei Zhuang,</p><p></p><p>Moyu Qilin fell silent.</p><p></p><p>She would not reveal any intelligence from her own mouth.</p><p></p><p>Even if Ying Zheng threatened her with death, it would be the same.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng saw her tightly closed lips, and fearless appearance.</p><p></p><p>He knew it was hopeless to expect getting any intelligence directly from her mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Since you refuse to tell me, then we can only use torture to open your mouth."</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Han, lock Moyu Qilin in the Devouring Fang Prison! Severely interrogate her for me, find out her purpose for intruding the harem!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes! This subordinate obeys the order!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han accepted the command and took people to drag Moyu Qilin away.</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thank you gentlemen!</p><p></p><p>Three things about reading: Read, Collect, and Reward!</p>

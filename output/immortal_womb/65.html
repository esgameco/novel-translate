        <h1>Chapter 65</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>After leaving the great hall, the Great Commander and the Lesser Commander looked at each other and smiled.</p><p></p><p>They had temporarily passed this hurdle.</p><p></p><p>Next, they would follow Ying Chen's orders, lay low, and wait to be summoned at any time.</p><p></p><p>Inside the great hall.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Goddess watched the departing figures of the Great Commander and Lesser Commander, and a strange feeling welled up in her heart.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know if it was her misconception, but she always felt that the atmosphere between these two people now seemed somewhat different from usual.</p><p></p><p>In the past, although the Great Commander and Lesser Commander often acted together, they didn't communicate much with each other.</p><p></p><p>Their relationship couldn't be said to be good.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was in no small part due to the Lesser Commander's dislike for talking.</p><p></p><p>But just now, the relationship between the two seemed to have become much more harmonious.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the two had a common pursuit and goal.</p><p></p><p>No longer the previous cold atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>However, this was just her feeling after all, and it couldn't be taken as definite. There was no evidence to speak of.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Goddess shook her head, thinking that perhaps she was overthinking it.</p><p></p><p>She turned to look at the Heavenly Emperor of the East: "Great Lord of the East, what should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>Should they take advantage of this momentum to secretly instigate Ying Zheng and Luo Wang to fight, or should they remain aloof and quietly observe the situation?</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Emperor of the East hesitated, deciding to listen to the opinions of others: "What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Star Soul spoke up: "Since they made a move when the two of them escaped, causing quite a commotion, the current Xianyang Palace must be on high alert, and it's not suitable for any more big moves."</p><p></p><p>The Moon Goddess concurred: "Sometimes, the more you do, the easier it is to expose flaws. We might as well continue to wait and see."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Emperor of the East was actually also inclined to hold off on action.</p><p></p><p>Since both the Great Commander and Lesser Commander were blocked by this mysterious person in the palace.</p><p></p><p>It showed that his strength was not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't be resolved in a short time, and rash action would only cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>This time they were lucky to leave no traces, and they couldn't act rashly again.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the Heavenly Emperor of the East had already made a decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, let's observe for a while and wait for an opportunity to influence Ying Zheng again."</p><p></p><p>"However, the Mirage must belong to the Yin-Yang family, and this point cannot be changed. You go urge Cloud Lord to refine better elixirs as soon as possible, and continue to persuade Ying Zheng to obtain the Mirage starting from the longevity medicine."</p><p></p><p>The Moon Goddess nodded and volunteered to take on this task: "Let me go."</p><p></p><p>Star Soul was more than happy to see her take the initiative.</p><p></p><p>Among these Yin-Yang family experts, the one he looked down on the most was Cloud Lord, and he didn't want to interact with him at all.</p><p></p><p>When the atmosphere in Xianyang City was tense, many people in the Mirror Lake Medical Manor, thousands of miles away,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The expressions on their faces were also solemn.</p><p></p><p>Because the poison within Gai Nie, Wei Zhuang, and Mo Yu Qilin was not simple.</p><p></p><p>The medical immortal Duan Mu Rong had been treating their injuries for some time now, but had not yet come out.</p><p></p><p>Finally, amidst everyone's anticipation, the door opened.</p><p></p><p>Duan Mu Rong walked out, looking exhausted.</p><p></p><p>Dao Zhi attentively offered her tea and asked, "Miss Rong, how are they doing?"</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he cared much about the people inside, but he had boasted in front of many people earlier.</p><p></p><p>He had said that no poison was a concern in the face of Duan Mu Rong.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want his boasts to fall flat.</p><p></p><p>So he was anxious to know the result now.</p><p></p><p>Duan Mu Rong sighed and said with a worried expression, "The poison in the three of them, while seemingly not as frightening as some poisons that seal the throat upon contact with blood, is actually like a chronic illness that is extremely difficult to eradicate once contracted."</p><p></p><p>"Even with my treatment, I can only slowly adjust their condition and gradually remove the toxicity from their bodies. Moreover, they cannot use their internal strength until they have fully recovered."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Duan Mu Rong say this, the Mo family patriarch couldn't help but frown.</p><p></p><p>He had already asked Gai Nie and Mo Yu Qilin, but neither of them knew who the mysterious person behind Ying Zheng was.</p><p></p><p>As such, the Mo family's hope of obtaining intelligence from them was gone.</p><p></p><p>He could only hope that after the three of them were cured of the poison, they would become a great help in their fight against Qin.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gai Nie and Wei Zhuang were rare powerful figures in the world, and Mo Yu Qilin's disguise techniques were also very useful for gathering intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the poison was not easy to cure, and now the three of them were poisoned and unable to use their internal strength.</p><p></p><p>In this way, after all their efforts, hadn't they just rescued a few burdens?</p><p></p><p>The other leaders of the Mo family also thought of this and their expressions immediately turned unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the expressions of the Mo family members, Zhang Liang immediately spoke up to comfort them, "Don't worry, everyone. At least this is not a fatal poison and there is still hope for a cure. When they successfully detoxify, they will be a great help to the Mo family."</p><p></p><p>The Mo family members thought carefully and felt that this made sense.</p><p></p><p>As a sword saint, Gai Nie's combat prowess was unquestionable.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang and the flowing sands behind him also had no shortage of talented individuals.</p><p></p><p>Once they were cured of the poison, they would also be a considerable force.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the expressions of the Mo family members finally improved somewhat.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere relaxed in this way.</p><p></p><p>But just then, a Mo family disciple ran in to report in a panic, "Not good! A patrolling Mo family disciple has died!"</p><p></p><p>The faces of the Mo family members changed greatly.</p><p></p><p>Dead? How could this happen?</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thanks to all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>The three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>

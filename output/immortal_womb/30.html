            <p>At the same time, a person arrived near the Mohist Mechanism City.</p><p></p><p>It was Zhang Liang, who had left the Xiaoshengxian Village.</p><p></p><p>Since he only knew that the Mohist Mechanism City was nearby, but did not know its exact location.</p><p></p><p>He could only come to the vicinity and try his luck.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhang Liang received a message via carrier pigeon.</p><p></p><p>He opened it and read, the message inside made him hold his breath.</p><p></p><p>The few words inside only mentioned one thing.</p><p></p><p>The Flowing Sand expert Mo Yu Qilin was captured outside the imperial harem.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>He had long heard of the reputation of the Flowing Sand expert Mo Yu Qilin.</p><p></p><p>He was not an ordinary assassin.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the art of disguise or his skills, Mo Yu Qilin was not someone that ordinary experts could handle.</p><p></p><p>And now, this person was quietly defeated in the imperial palace of the Qin State.</p><p></p><p>Who on earth was the one who defeated Mo Yu Qilin?</p><p></p><p>And what kind of powerful figure was able to force Mo Yu Qilin to the point where he couldn't even escape?!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of his speculations, Zhang Liang became more certain that there must be a master behind all these recent events!</p><p></p><p>It was he who planned and led everything behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Gai Nie, papermaking techniques, or this time with Mo Yu Qilin.</p><p></p><p>Although there was no evidence, he had a strong premonition that the Mo Yu Qilin incident was related to this master.</p><p></p><p>Either he took action himself, or he planned it.</p><p></p><p>In any case, if this person was not eliminated, he would be the biggest obstacle to the anti-Qin alliance in the future!</p><p></p><p>He must find a way to obtain intelligence about this person!</p><p></p><p>Just as Zhang Liang was pondering, he sensed that people around him were approaching.</p><p></p><p>And gradually converging towards him.</p><p></p><p>Although there were many people, he could not sense any malice or killing intent.</p><p></p><p>He immediately guessed the identity of the arrivals.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang said loudly, "Zhang Liang of the Confucian school, here to visit the Mohist family, please lead the way."</p><p></p><p>Several Mohist disciples appeared from various places, confirmed Zhang Liang's identity, and explained to him, "So it's Mr. Zhang Liang, we just wanted to confirm your identity, please forgive us."</p><p></p><p>"However, outsiders who want to enter the Mohist Mechanism City must have their eyes covered."</p><p></p><p>The Mohist Mechanism City was the most mysterious stronghold of the Mohist school, and also the safest hiding place for anti-Qin people.</p><p></p><p>This move was only to ensure the safety of the Mohist Mechanism City and avoid the infiltration of spies sent by the Qin King Ying Zheng.</p><p></p><p>This action made people feel even safer.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang expressed his understanding, he closed his eyes and said, "I understand the rules, do it your way."</p><p></p><p>The Mohist disciples took out the eye-covering tool and covered Zhang Liang's eyes.</p><p></p><p>After Zhang Liang's eyes were covered, he could only</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Following the Mohist disciples, they entered the Mohist Mechanical City. </p><p></p><p>It was unknown how long they had walked.</p><p></p><p>By the time the restrictions on Zhang Liang were lifted and he could see things again, he was already inside the Mohist Mechanical City.</p><p></p><p>Standing before him was a group of renowned figures in the martial world. </p><p></p><p>The one wearing a bamboo hat with only the lower half of his face exposed was the Mohist leader.</p><p></p><p>He stood in the middle of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Next to him were Snow Woman, Gao Jianli, Dao Zhi, Big Iron Hammer, Master Ban and other Mohist leaders.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's eyes were examining Zhang Liang.</p><p></p><p>In those eyes there was curiosity, but also wariness.</p><p></p><p>The Mohist leader was the first to ask: "Zhang Liang, what have you come to the Mohists for?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang did not answer this question, but instead asked: "Have you all received the news of Gai Nie being captured?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Gai Nie's name came out, the faces of the Mohist crowd changed.</p><p></p><p>"Gai Nie? The Sword Saint?"</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't he a close guard of the King of Qin in the past? How could he have been captured?" </p><p></p><p>"I heard he defected, so he was captured and brought back."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't that a great thing then?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Jianli said coldly: "We naturally know of Gai Nie's great reputation. If it weren't for him, Jing Ke would not have died. He deserves to be caught."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang could see that most of the Mohists felt Gai Nie's fate was his own doing and did not see the deeper situation behind it.</p><p></p><p>He shook his head and began to recount the strange aspects of Gai Nie's defection. </p><p></p><p>"On the day Gai Nie defected, I heard it was because Ying Zheng ordered those Yin-Yang masters to ambush him in advance."</p><p></p><p>"But how did Ying Zheng learn of this news? Even the Shadow Night Guards only discovered his defection after Gai Nie had left."</p><p></p><p>"Don't you all find it strange?"</p><p></p><p>For a moment, no one spoke. Clearly, they too had realized the oddity in it.</p><p></p><p>Gao Jianli looked at Zhang Liang, his tone unfriendly: "What exactly are you trying to say?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang put forth his speculation: "I speculate that behind Ying Zheng, there is a highly skilled person guiding him, which is why Ying Zheng thought to ambush Gai Nie in advance at Cangyue Valley."</p><p></p><p>"This person is very mysterious, and currently there is no intelligence related to them. However, I believe Gai Nie, who has been by Ying Zheng's side for a long time, may know something."</p><p></p><p>The Mohist leader heard the implication in Zhang Liang's words and astutely pointed out his intention: "So, after saying so much, you've actually come to request that we rescue Gai Nie?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gao Jianli's face changed. </p><p></p><p>Rescue Gai Nie?!</p><p></p><p>Rescue the Gai Nie who caused Jing Ke's death?! </p><p></p><p>Impossible!</p>

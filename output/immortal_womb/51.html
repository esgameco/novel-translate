        <h1>Chapter 51</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Hearing that the people were currently unable to eat, Ying Chen felt helpless.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but let his thoughts wander.</p><p></p><p>[As the saying goes, if you live near the mountains, you eat from the mountains; if you live near the sea, you eat from the sea. There's more food in the sea compared to the land. If it were me, I would build a large number of fishing boats and use large fishing nets to catch fish.]</p><p></p><p>[Anyway, during this period, marine resources are so abundant that there's no need to worry about protecting animals or anything like that.]</p><p></p><p>[However, if we do this, we'll also need ice, otherwise the fish will spoil during transportation. For that, we'll need to use niter to make ice.]</p><p></p><p>The niter Ying Chen referred to was potassium nitrate.</p><p></p><p>When potassium nitrate dissolves in water, an endothermic reaction occurs, which can gradually lower the temperature of the water until it drops below the freezing point, at which point the water will solidify into ice.</p><p></p><p>This is an ancient method that was widely used during the Song Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>At that time, people used this principle to make ice cubes for cooling off in the summer or preserving cold drinks.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng, who had heard Ying Chen's inner thoughts throughout, was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>This brat really has a solution?!</p><p></p><p>Fishing boats and nets are easy to arrange, just find the Gong Shu family, they will definitely be able to make them.</p><p></p><p>He could also understand the need for ice cubes.</p><p></p><p>When fighting in the north, ice cubes were also used to keep meat fresh. To transport seafood to the inland, ice is indeed crucial.</p><p></p><p>But what does niter ice-making mean?</p><p></p><p>Can ice cubes be made with this niter?</p><p></p><p>If it can really be done, wouldn't that mean ice cubes can be made in any season?</p><p></p><p>It seems that whether this matter can successfully solve the problem of food shortage depends on this step!</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng was excited and couldn't wait to hear the specific method of niter ice-making.</p><p></p><p>But what frustrated him was that next, Ying Chen didn't mention anything more about niter ice-making.</p><p></p><p>What to do? He can't directly ask either, right? Otherwise, he would expose himself!</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng pondered for a moment and couldn't help but speculate.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that niter ice-making is very easy?</p><p></p><p>So easy that in this brat's view, there's no need to say more?</p><p></p><p>Just gather the materials and it can be done?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Ying Zheng couldn't help but want to give it a try.</p><p></p><p>He stood up and said to Li Si, "Li Si, come with me."</p><p></p><p>Li Si was now completely at a loss.</p><p></p><p>What does Your Majesty mean?</p><p></p><p>Inexplicably summoning him to the Shu Fei Palace, having him repeat the issues he had described, not only did he not provide an answer to aid the disaster victims,</p><p></p><p>but also inexplicably took him along to do what?</p><p></p><p>Li Si prided himself on thoroughly understanding His Majesty's thoughts. Even if he didn't understand, he could at least guess seven or eight out of ten.</p><p></p><p>But recently, he had completely lost grasp of what His Majesty was thinking.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that His Majesty had already stood up and walked ahead, Li Si didn't dare to ask more and could only follow obediently.</p><p></p><p>Not long after.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Li Si stood by a pool inside the palace, waiting silently.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Zhang Han arrived.</p><p></p><p>Behind him followed several Yin Mi guards, carrying a chest, looking quite strained.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han instructed the Yin Mi guards to put down the chests one by one.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Li Si was already full of questions.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't His Majesty supposed to discuss the food shortage with him?</p><p></p><p>Why wait here? To watch Zhang Han and the others move chests?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the chests contained His Majesty's personal treasury?</p><p></p><p>Did His Majesty want to use his own private money to supplement the national treasury and transport food from other places?</p><p></p><p>After all the chests were put in place, Zhang Han ordered the Yin Mi guards to open them one by one.</p><p></p><p>What was stored in the chests was none other than the collected saltpeter.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the contents of the chests were not gold or treasures, Li Si couldn't help but feel disappointed.</p><p></p><p>The chests were all filled with saltpeter. What use could it have?</p><p></p><p>Now he was even more perplexed.</p><p></p><p>What was His Majesty trying to do?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't there a shortage of food? Why collect saltpeter?</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng seemed to have already seen the confusion in Li Si's eyes. He ordered Zhang Han, "Zhang Han, bring a basin of water."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han responded and went to fetch a basin of water, placing it in front of Ying Zheng.</p><p></p><p>The clear ripples gently swayed under the sunlight, reflecting the shadows of the few men.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng looked at the saltpeter in the chests and said, "Zhang Han, take a few pieces of saltpeter and put them in the water."</p><p></p><p>Although Zhang Han did not understand, he followed the instructions one by one.</p><p></p><p>The white saltpeter was crushed by Zhang Han into a powder.</p><p></p><p>When the powder was put into the water basin, it combined with the water and began to dissolve rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Then, the water in the basin quickly underwent a visible change.</p><p></p><p>The originally clear ripples began to produce tiny ice crystals due to the dissolution of the saltpeter.</p><p></p><p>As more and more saltpeter dissolved, the ice crystals gradually spread.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it spread throughout the entire water basin.</p><p></p><p>It actually turned into a sheet of ice!</p><p></p><p>The original water had actually turned into ice!</p><p></p><p>If one hadn't seen it with their own eyes, who would believe it?!</p><p></p><p>The observing Li Si and Zhang Han, upon seeing this scene, were stunned.</p><p></p><p>The two couldn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>It was clearly not winter now, and the temperature was so high. How could ice form?</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han reached out and touched the ice in the water basin.</p><p></p><p>What he felt was a sheet of coldness.</p><p></p><p>He was certain that what was now in the water basin was indeed ice, not his illusion.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhang Han's action, Li Si already understood that it was not his own hallucination.</p><p></p><p>The water had indeed turned into ice!</p><p></p><p>What on earth was going on?</p><p></p><p>What exactly did His Majesty do? Why would this happen?</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thanks to all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>Three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Disguised as the palace maid Ruyi, it didn't take long before she saw the shadow of Shu Fei's palace.</p><p></p><p>She walked in with utmost naturalness, greeting the others.</p><p></p><p>Everyone responded to her while going about their own business.</p><p></p><p>The entire process was smooth as silk, and no one noticed that she was a fake Ruyi in disguise.</p><p></p><p>The palace maid Jixiang saw that Ruyi had finally returned and couldn't help but complain, "I sent you to get some incense, why did it take you so long?"</p><p></p><p>With Ruyi gone, many tasks fell on her shoulders, and she couldn't handle it all by herself.</p><p></p><p>So when she saw Ruyi, she couldn't help but say a few words.</p><p></p><p>The fake Ruyi explained in a gentle tone, "I should have been back earlier, but I encountered someone on my way back who said they needed help, so I was slightly delayed."</p><p></p><p>Her words were reasonable and left Jixiang with nothing to say.</p><p></p><p>The fake Ruyi was not afraid of talking to others at all.</p><p></p><p>Because her voice was exactly the same as the real Ruyi's, without the slightest difference!</p><p></p><p>No one could discern the difference between them.</p><p></p><p>As expected, Jixiang didn't suspect anything and urged, "Since you're back, hurry and light the incense. If His Majesty comes and there's no incense to calm his mind, it won't do."</p><p></p><p>Ever since His Majesty needed this incense, Shu Fei would light it in advance.</p><p></p><p>This way, when His Majesty arrived, he could directly smell the fragrance.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the ingredients in the incense posed no harm to Shu Fei's body or the child in her womb.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, many of the medicinal materials were beneficial to her health.</p><p></p><p>So Shu Fei herself also enjoyed the scent of this incense.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Jixiang say this, Ruyi nodded and carried the incense towards the inner chamber.</p><p></p><p>Inside the inner chamber, Shu Fei was feeling drowsy.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the fake Ruyi enter with the incense, she knew her purpose.</p><p></p><p>The fake Ruyi respectfully bowed to Shu Fei.</p><p></p><p>Shu Fei nodded, exempting the fake Ruyi from formalities, and didn't notice any difference between her and the previous Ruyi.</p><p></p><p>Ruyi was one of her close attendants, and Shu Fei had always trusted those by her side without suspicion, so she wouldn't monitor their actions.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Shu Fei quickly shifted her gaze, no longer watching the fake Ruyi's movements.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen, who was cultivating, sensed the changes in the outside world and took a glance with his spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>He thought Ying Zheng had come again, but it seemed that wasn't the case.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that someone had just entered, and she appeared to be an ordinary palace maid.</p><p></p><p>However, just as Ying Chen was about to continue his cultivation, he suddenly felt something abnormal!</p><p></p><p>The palace maid who had just entered was suspicious!</p><p></p><p>The aura on her body was not something an ordinary person could possess!</p><p></p><p>There was something fishy about her!</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen used his...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His divine sense enveloped her body, and the area covered by his divine sense appeared slightly distorted. </p><p></p><p>That distorted area had a somewhat illusory color, as if a layer of skin was draped over the surface.</p><p></p><p>It made it impossible to clearly see what was inside.</p><p></p><p>This made it even more suspicious.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen was more curious about the palace maid's true identity.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Ying Chen condensed his divine sense into a thin needle.</p><p></p><p>Then he pierced it towards the palace maid's body!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the palace maid's true face was fully exposed under his powerful divine sense!</p><p></p><p>The disguise on the surface faded away, revealing a different face underneath!</p><p></p><p>That face had absolutely no resemblance to the original palace maid!</p><p></p><p>She was someone else disguised as a palace maid!</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen was a bit surprised, not expecting that he would inadvertently discover a big fish!</p><p></p><p>Aside from himself, probably no one else could see through this kind of disguise ability.</p><p></p><p>Could this person be that mysterious Mo Yu Qilin?!</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen recalled the descriptions he had read about Mo Yu Qilin and the fragments of her appearances.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Mo Yu Qilin, who was lighting incense, paused her movements and couldn't help but look around.</p><p></p><p>What's going on?</p><p></p><p>Just now for an instant, her disguise ability actually stagnated for a moment!</p><p></p><p>It was as if someone had lifted her disguise!</p><p></p><p>This was the first time she ever had this feeling!</p><p></p><p>Was this just her illusion?</p><p></p><p>Or was there a master here?</p><p></p><p>Mo Yu Qilin recalled those rumors about the Shu Fei Palace.</p><p></p><p>Even the current generation's Sword Saint Gai Nie had stumbled here, with someone seeing through his defection route.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this master could also see through her disguise?</p><p></p><p>As soon as this thought arose, Mo Yu Qilin's actions became even more cautious.</p><p></p><p>Her every move was filled with a careful air.</p><p></p><p>It seemed this mission was not as simple as she had imagined!</p><p></p><p>Especially the Shu Fei Palace, it really was a bit unusual!</p><p></p><p>Before, she had thought that others exaggerated the rumors because of their own failures.</p><p></p><p>Now she unexpectedly discovered it was all true!</p><p></p><p>There really was a master here!</p><p></p><p>Someone who had not exposed their aura at all, but instead made her aura stagnate for a moment!</p><p></p><p>Such a master might have already seen through her disguise!</p><p></p><p>However, this also happened to arouse her competitive spirit.</p><p></p><p>In terms of fighting, she was not the strongest.</p><p></p><p>But in terms of infiltration and disguise, she had absolute confidence in her abilities!</p><p></p><p>In this area, she did not believe she would lose!</p><p></p><p>She would use her skills to investigate the other party's background, and then transmit the intelligence out!</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thank you to the various handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>Feilu Novels, Fei wants you to have a good read!</p>

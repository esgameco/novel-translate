        <h1>Chapter 55</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The news of Shu Fei's promotion to the rank of "Beauty" quickly spread among the palace concubines and servants, drawing countless envious and jealous looks.</p><p></p><p>By this time, everyone had realized that Shu Fei's promotion was not a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>His Majesty had truly taken Shu Fei to heart.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would not have bestowed rewards every few days.</p><p></p><p>The palace maids and eunuchs all tried their best to be assigned to serve in Shu Fei's palace.</p><p></p><p>The concubines without children could only be angry in the palace, while Shu Fei, who was pregnant, still monopolized His Majesty's attention.</p><p></p><p>The concubines with sons immediately sent letters to their sons, asking them to be wary of this potential great enemy.</p><p></p><p>Among the princes, the one who reacted the most strongly was naturally Hu Hai.</p><p></p><p>In the residence of the Eighteen Princes of the Great Qin, there was a gloomy atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>Hu Hai was punching and kicking these few servants, venting his anger.</p><p></p><p>While beating them, he cursed angrily, "What kind of thing is Shu Fei? How dare she be on an equal footing with my mother?"</p><p></p><p>"A few years ago, she didn't even have the qualifications to see my mother, how dare she?! How dare she ride on my mother's head?!"</p><p></p><p>The servants were beaten black and blue, occasionally letting out muffled groans, but their bodies did not dare to dodge at all.</p><p></p><p>Because they knew that if they dodged, the prince would only become angrier, and his hands would be heavier.</p><p></p><p>At that time, even if they didn't die, they would be left with a disability.</p><p></p><p>They all became servants because of their poor family backgrounds. Once they became disabled, they would not be far from death.</p><p></p><p>So, every one of them gritted their teeth and endured.</p><p></p><p>They hoped in their hearts that Hu Hai would vent his anger as soon as possible and stop the beating.</p><p></p><p>After venting for a while, Hu Hai stopped only when his hands and feet were sore from beating.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he remembered Zhao Gao, who was usually by his side, and angrily said, "Where is Zhao Gao? Why haven't I seen him coming recently?"</p><p></p><p>The housekeeper saw that Hu Hai's anger had subsided a little, and carefully ran over and said, "The Prefect of the Central Carriage, Zhao Gao, has been punished by His Majesty and is under house arrest for self-reflection. He is temporarily unable to go out."</p><p></p><p>"And His Majesty has already revoked his qualification to tutor you, Prince."</p><p></p><p>Hu Hai was stunned for a moment, then became furious and said, "What?! How come you didn't tell me earlier about such a big thing?!"</p><p></p><p>The housekeeper was in a difficult position, but he smiled on the surface and said, "This servant had previously reported it to you, but the prince was playing games with the singing girls at that time and may not have heard it."</p><p></p><p>Hu Hai kicked the housekeeper to the ground and said arrogantly, "So, are you saying that this matter is my fault?"</p><p></p><p>The housekeeper didn't dare to say that. He quickly begged for mercy, "This servant doesn't dare. It's this servant's fault. Please spare my life, Prince!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Hai no longer had much strength to argue with the housekeeper. After kicking him a few times, he took his men and hurried to Zhao Gao's residence.</p><p></p><p>He didn't care about others, but Zhao Gao must be by his side!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao was his big backer!</p><p></p><p>Without Zhao Gao, how could he compete with Fu Su?!</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that now there was also a</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The concubine Shu, red to the point of turning purple.</p><p></p><p>He was still hoping that Zhao Gao could help him get rid of concubine Shu and her child!</p><p></p><p>Without Zhao Gao's help, he couldn't do anything on his own!</p><p></p><p>Soon, Hu Hai arrived at Zhao Gao's residence, but was stopped by the guards.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, you cannot enter."</p><p></p><p>Hu Hai, already in a foul mood, flew into a rage and directly struck the guard.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of thing are you? How dare you block the young master?"</p><p></p><p>The guard knew Hu Hai's identity was noble and didn't dare fight back, only able to endure in silence. </p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he was wearing armor, so even being hit, he didn't feel too much pain.</p><p></p><p>Instead it was Hu Hai, punching the armor, whose hand hurt badly.</p><p></p><p>He became even angrier, grabbing the guard's sword at his waist, intending to kill the guards at the door and force his way in.</p><p></p><p>The guards, seeing him draw his sword, instinctively made defensive moves.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this person dare to dodge, Hu Hai became even more enraged and immediately raised the sword to hack at the guard.</p><p></p><p>Just as things were about to get out of hand and lives were about to be lost at the door, some people could no longer play deaf and mute.</p><p></p><p>A black shadow appeared behind Hu Hai, the person wearing the attire of an imperial armored soldier.</p><p></p><p>It was Yan Ri.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, show mercy!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri blocked Hu Hai's action.</p><p></p><p>Hu Hai, seeing Yan Ri, angrily said: "You also want to stop the young master?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri helplessly explained: "Young master, no one is allowed to enter or exit, this is His Majesty's order. Do you want to disobey His Majesty?"</p><p></p><p>The guards here were not only to prevent Zhao Gao from leaving.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, it was to prevent outsiders from entering.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao had already incurred His Majesty's disgust. If at this juncture Hu Hai caused any trouble,</p><p></p><p>and it reached His Majesty's ears, the first to be blamed would be Zhao Gao as a servant.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this was His Majesty's order, Hu Hai's mind finally came around.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, he was still His Majesty's favored young son and couldn't reveal any flaws in this matter.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if the news got back to His Majesty, he would certainly earn His Majesty's disdain.</p><p></p><p>His Majesty had so many sons, and he had worked hard to make an impression on His Majesty.</p><p></p><p>How could he ruin it over such a small matter?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Hu Hai's rationality returned in an instant, and he threw the sword to his subordinate.</p><p></p><p>Since he couldn't enter the residence to see Zhao Gao, he could only convey the message another way.</p><p></p><p>Hu Hai handed Yan Ri a note: "Take this and give it to Zhao Gao for the young master."</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri took the note and accepted the task.</p><p></p><p>With that, there was nothing more Hu Hai could do. He could only leave with a gloomy expression.</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thanks to all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>Feilu Novels, Fei wants you to have a good read!</p>

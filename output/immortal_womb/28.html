        <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter Han brought Mo Yu Qilin to the Shi Ya Prison.</p><p></p><p>The escorted Mo Yu Qilin walked unsteadily.</p><p></p><p>She recalled the intelligence she had received before coming.</p><p></p><p>She remembered that according to the intelligence, Gai Nie was imprisoned in Shi Ya Prison after being captured.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Gai Nie was really imprisoned in this place?</p><p></p><p>At the thought of this possibility, Mo Yu Qilin began to inconspicuously observe the surrounding prison cells.</p><p></p><p>Inside, one by one, were different prisoners.</p><p></p><p>As she passed by a cell, she couldn't help but slow down her pace.</p><p></p><p>The person imprisoned in that cell was none other than the former Sword Saint, Gai Nie!</p><p></p><p>Although the currently imprisoned Gai Nie was covered in wounds from head to toe, and his former graceful appearance as the Sword Saint could hardly be seen.</p><p></p><p>But Mo Yu Qilin still recognized him at a glance!</p><p></p><p>Gai Nie's miserable state made Mo Yu Qilin look at him a few more times involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the intelligence from Luo Wang was indeed accurate.</p><p></p><p>Gai Nie was indeed in Shi Ya Prison.</p><p></p><p>However, with this, she was at ease.</p><p></p><p>Although Wei Zhuang kept shouting about killing Gai Nie every day, saying that he would kill him at every turn.</p><p></p><p>But Mo Yu Qilin knew that Lord Wei Zhuang would definitely come to save them.</p><p></p><p>He would never watch Gai Nie die at the hands of others.</p><p></p><p>Noticing Gai Nie's injuries, Chapter Han stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>He asked the jailer beside him, "Has Gai Nie confessed the detailed reasons for his defection?"</p><p></p><p>At the mention of this, the jailer shook his head helplessly and sighed, "No, no matter what punishment was used, he just won't say."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the movement of the two people talking, Gai Nie managed to raise his head and looked towards the speakers.</p><p></p><p>When he saw Chapter Han and the escorted Mo Yu Qilin, his eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>The original haziness in his eyes dissipated, revealing a few traces of clarity.</p><p></p><p>"Mo Yu Qilin?! You were also captured? How is Xiao Zhuang? How is Xiao Zhuang doing?"</p><p></p><p>Gai Nie's tone was anxious.</p><p></p><p>He knew Mo Yu Qilin's strength, and if even she was captured, wouldn't Wei Zhuang also be in danger?</p><p></p><p>Who on earth could make a move to capture Mo Yu Qilin?!</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Gai Nie still had the strength to speak, Mo Yu Qilin knew that he could still endure those injuries.</p><p></p><p>She breathed a sigh of relief in her heart.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, she said indifferently, "Lord Wei Zhuang is doing very well. He even said that even if you die, you have to die by his hands."</p><p></p><p>These words were very much in line with Wei Zhuang's personality and sounded like something he would say.</p><p></p><p>But more importantly, Gai Nie understood the other meaning behind these words.</p><p></p><p>Mo Yu Qilin was telling him that Wei Zhuang already knew he was imprisoned here and would definitely take action to come and rescue him.</p><p></p><p>Gai Nie couldn't help but smile bitterly.</p><p></p><p>If possible, he really wanted to tell Wei Zhuang not to come, not to take the risk to come and save him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, with Zhang Han present, he could only remain silent to avoid exposing Wei Zhuang's intentions and implicating Wei Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>Gai Nie's conversation with Mo Yu Qilin fell into the ears of another person. </p><p></p><p>At this time, a voice came from the prison cell next door, mocking Gai Nie: "Even your junior brother wants to kill you, how much of a failure must you be as a person."</p><p></p><p>"You say you've devoted yourself to Ying Zheng, but what have you gotten in return?"</p><p></p><p>The sarcasm in those words almost broke through the sky.</p><p></p><p>Every word revealed dissatisfaction with Ying Zheng.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han took a few steps to the front of that prison cell and kicked the cell bars.</p><p></p><p>His face was ice cold: "Sheng Qi, are you tired of living? How dare you directly call His Majesty's name?"</p><p></p><p>The person speaking was Sheng Qi.</p><p></p><p>He had been captured by the Seven States many times and thrown into death row, but he always managed to escape.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, he was captured by Gai Nie, who was Ying Zheng's close guard at the time, and thrown into the Shi Ya Prison. </p><p></p><p>It had been ten years.</p><p></p><p>Of course he had no good feelings towards Gai Nie, who had caused him to fall into this situation.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, he would say a few words to mock Gai Nie, who was already used to it.</p><p></p><p>But Zhang Han could not tolerate his disrespect towards His Majesty.</p><p></p><p>Sheng Qi's heart had been tempered through the long years without freedom.</p><p></p><p>Faced with Zhang Han's accusation, he sneered, completely unafraid: "If you have the ability, kill me now."</p><p></p><p>This fearless attitude immediately enraged Zhang Han!</p><p></p><p>The veins on Zhang Han's forehead bulged as he almost wanted to end Sheng Qi's life immediately!</p><p></p><p>But he held back.</p><p></p><p>Sheng Qi was still useful now, and it wasn't up to him to decide whether to kill him or not.</p><p></p><p>That required His Majesty's decision.</p><p></p><p>Sheng Qi must also know this, which is why he dared to provoke him without fear.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han would not fall for this trick.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han turned and walked away, directly grabbing Mo Yu Qilin and locking her in another cell.</p><p></p><p>Mo Yu Qilin still didn't seem to show any panic, as if coming here was just a short stay.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han knew that she probably still thought she could escape from here.</p><p></p><p>So, Zhang Han sneered in warning: "Now that you're here, don't even think about escaping. Honestly confess and you'll suffer less. It's better for both of us this way."</p><p></p><p>Honestly confess, and they would receive less torture, allowing the Shadow Guards to complete their mission sooner.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Zhang Han also knew that these treacherous rebels would not listen to him.</p><p></p><p>So he didn't expect them to cooperate obediently.</p><p></p><p>But the routine warning still had to be said.</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Zhang Han turned and left.</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thanks to all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>Feilu Novels, Fei wants you to have a good read!</p>

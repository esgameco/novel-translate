        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Upon hearing the news that the Longevity Elixir was successfully refined, Ying Zheng couldn't help but brighten his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In order to solve the problem of his headache, he had previously summoned many Qi refiners.</p><p></p><p>Among the best of them was Yun Zhong Jun from the Yin-Yang family.</p><p></p><p>He had previously stated that once the Longevity Elixir was refined, it would not only solve his headache but also prolong his life.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect it to be refined in such a short time!</p><p></p><p>What a good day today!</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng was overjoyed: "Quick! Quickly invite Yun Zhong Jun to come in!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ying Chen already understood what had happened in the plot, and he couldn't help but complain inwardly.</p><p></p><p>[How could the Longevity Elixir be so easy to refine? This old fellow Yun Zhong Jun is capable of refining the Ghost Controlling Elixir, which can refine people into medicine men and control their minds. Who knows what he has handed over?]</p><p></p><p>[Even if there really is such a good thing, he would definitely have taken it himself. How could he offer it up? Poor Brother Zheng, wise for a lifetime, confused for a moment.]</p><p></p><p>[I hope Brother Zheng will be more careful and at least let someone test it for toxicity. Don't be foolish and just eat it.]</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng heard the inner voice, and his surging heart felt like it had been soaked in icy water.</p><p></p><p>It immediately calmed him down.</p><p></p><p>Yes, if such a good thing as the Longevity Elixir had no side effects after eating it, why wouldn't the refiner eat it himself?</p><p></p><p>Prolonging life is something everyone pursues.</p><p></p><p>Who would dislike a long life?</p><p></p><p>At this time, Yun Zhong Jun did not know that the emperor's thoughts had changed.</p><p></p><p>He strode in, ecstatic: "Your Majesty! I have finally refined the Longevity Elixir for Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he raised his hands high and presented the so-called Longevity Elixir.</p><p></p><p>If it were the previous Ying Zheng, he would have excitedly accepted the elixir and tasted it impatiently.</p><p></p><p>But now, after being reminded, he looked at everything with a layer of suspicious filter.</p><p></p><p>That was the extreme calmness displayed by a person after becoming sober.</p><p></p><p>So Ying Zheng smiled faintly at this time.</p><p></p><p>His eyes only glanced at the elixir on the tray, and then he let the eunuch beside him put it away.</p><p></p><p>He showed no intention of taking it immediately.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the emperor's attitude that was completely different from usual, Yun Zhong Jun's joyful expression gradually faded.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but feel a pang of inexplicable panic sweeping through his body.</p><p></p><p>What's wrong with His Majesty?</p><p></p><p>Why does he seem uninterested in his elixir?</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ying Zheng also sat in the upper position, quietly observing Yun Zhong Jun.</p><p></p><p>He saw the uneasiness that flashed across Yun Zhong Jun's face when he didn't receive the expected reaction from him.</p><p></p><p>Thus, his suspicion in his heart deepened even more.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng looked at Yun Zhong Jun and suddenly asked, "What is the Ghost Control Pill?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the term "Ghost Control Pill", Yun Zhong Jun's facial expression twitched slightly. </p><p></p><p>Although he remembered that he was in front of the Emperor, he quickly concealed his unnatural reaction.</p><p></p><p>However, this brief moment was still captured by Ying Zheng.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zhong Jun tried his best to control his expression and forced a smile, asking, "Your Majesty, from where did you learn about the Ghost Control Pill?"</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng's sharp gaze scanned up and down Yun Zhong Jun, as if he had already seen through his disguise.</p><p></p><p>Cold sweat formed on Yun Zhong Jun's back and flowed down his neck. </p><p></p><p>He was nervous, wondering if the Emperor's inquiry was simply because he had heard of such a thing?</p><p></p><p>Or did he already know that the Ghost Control Pill was made by his own hands?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Emperor had discovered he was using the Ghost Control Pill to turn living people into medicinal puppets? </p><p></p><p>Just thinking about this possibility made Yun Zhong Jun's legs start to tremble.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for who knows how long, Yun Zhong Jun finally heard the Emperor's response from above.</p><p></p><p>His majestic voice was neither sad nor happy, saying, "Don't worry about where I learned it from, just answer the question."</p><p></p><p>That tone had a domineering, irrefutable imperial might.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the Emperor was determined to get an answer to this question no matter what.</p><p></p><p>Since he already knew the name, even if he lied, it would eventually be found out.</p><p></p><p>It was better to answer truthfully now and then distance himself from it later.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zhong Jun made up his mind and had no choice but to grit his teeth and reply, "The Ghost Control Pill is a kind of elixir that can manipulate living people."</p><p></p><p>Although Yun Zhong Jun's answer was very simple and vague, it was almost the same as what Ying Zheng had just heard.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that what the boy said was true, and there really existed such an evil elixir in this world.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng became alert in his heart, and the way he looked at Yun Zhong Jun no longer had the previous enthusiasm.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng nodded to indicate that he understood, rewarded Yun Zhong Jun with some gold and silver, and then dismissed him.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zhong Jun walked out of Shu Fei Palace, his face completely gloomy.</p><p></p><p>What was going on?</p><p></p><p>Where exactly did the problem arise?</p><p></p><p>How did the Emperor find out about the Ghost Control Pill?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he himself had become suspicious of the elixir that was offered?</p><p></p><p>Would he go and investigate the recently presented elixir?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this possibility, Yun Zhong Jun became uneasy.</p><p></p><p>He had indeed added some things to the elixir he offered, but the content was very low.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary physicians shouldn't be able to detect it, right?</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thanks to all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>Three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>

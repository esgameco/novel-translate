        <h1>Chapter 38</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Just as Ying Chen was still feeling his own realm improvement.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ying Zheng arrived with Zhang Han.</p><p></p><p>Shu Fei and others paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen couldn't help but complain.</p><p></p><p>[Brother Zheng, are you really treating Shu Fei Palace as your own place to hold court? Why do you keep coming over from time to time?]</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ying Zheng cursed inwardly: You little brat, the whole world is mine, I go wherever I want to go, do I still need your consent?</p><p></p><p>On the surface, Ying Zheng still maintained a calm appearance. He looked at Zhang Han and said calmly, "Start explaining in detail the situation of the Shi Ya Prison."</p><p></p><p>Faced with the emperor's request, Zhang Han was a little dumbfounded for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, he was originally prepared to report the situation in the Qilin Hall, but His Majesty interrupted his words and wouldn't let him speak.</p><p></p><p>He insisted on dragging him to Shu Fei Palace.</p><p></p><p>Then after arriving here, he instead began to ask him in detail, this operation made him somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>It was as if this place was not a resting place for the rear palace, but a more formal place than the Qilin Hall.</p><p></p><p>Was this his illusion?</p><p></p><p>Why did it feel like His Majesty's choice of meeting place had deviated from before?</p><p></p><p>Important matters always had to be discussed in Shu Fei Palace.</p><p></p><p>Instead, the Qilin Hall, which normally handled political affairs, became a place for handling miscellaneous matters.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how much he didn't understand his superior's mood, since he was asked, he had to answer.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han put away his inner complaints and began to report the situation of Shi Ya Prison to Ying Zheng.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty is truly as perceptive as a god! That Wei Zhuang really came to Shi Ya Prison, wanting to rescue Gai Nie and Mo Yu Qilin."</p><p></p><p>"As a result, as soon as he entered, he was caught red-handed by us, and after he was defeated by us, he was already imprisoned in Shi Ya Prison."</p><p></p><p>"This time, thanks to Your Majesty's reminder, otherwise we would have really let this Wei Zhuang succeed!"</p><p></p><p>Two precise predictions made Zhang Han now admire His Majesty with all his heart.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for His Majesty's reminder, he really couldn't imagine that Wei Zhuang would actually have the guts to dare to break into Shi Ya Prison alone!</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he listened to His Majesty's words and timely crushed Wei Zhuang's plan.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he, who had repeatedly neglected his duties, would have been stripped of his official position long ago.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Zhang Han's words of praise for himself, Ying Zheng felt a little elated for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han was grateful to believe his words, in fact, so was he!</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng was also secretly grateful in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he listened to his son's words from the very beginning, invisibly making the right choice again and again.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, these people would have gathered together to plan to overthrow his Great Qin!</p><p></p><p>Apart from the method of longevity, he didn't expect his son to be so useful at first.</p><p></p><p>It could be said to be an unexpected</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This made him very happy. </p><p></p><p>As a result, whenever he was indecisive about something, he would think of coming to Shu Fei Palace.</p><p></p><p>He wouldn't even miss the chance to report on the situation. </p><p></p><p>What if? What if this kid thought of something important again?</p><p></p><p>With this thought in mind, he almost subconsciously wanted to come to Shu Fei Palace.</p><p></p><p>In short, Wei Zhuang had been captured, and this result made him very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>When he was in Han, he had thought about winning over Wei Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>But now it seems that the descendants of Gui Gu are not so easy to control after all.</p><p></p><p>Gai Nie, for the sake of others, directly betrayed his trust.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang, with his unyielding and arrogant temperament, does not even take the Shi Ya Prison seriously.</p><p></p><p>These two people are not good subjects to control at all.</p><p></p><p>However, with the current power of the Great Qin, the mere descendants of Gui Gu are no longer important.</p><p></p><p>Compared with his extraordinarily talented son, anyone in front of him pales in comparison.</p><p></p><p>It should be said that with his son, he feels that no one else can compare to this son.</p><p></p><p>He knows the anti-Qin forces behind the scenes, he knows military affairs, and he knows the answers to almost everything.</p><p></p><p>I ask, where else in the world is there such a genius?</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han also reported on the situation of the remaining people of Liu Sha.</p><p></p><p>"The people of Liu Sha are more vigilant. They did not follow Wei Zhuang into the Shi Ya Prison. They should be trying to meet up with Wei Zhuang."</p><p></p><p>"They left in time afterwards, so we didn't catch them. Please forgive me, Your Majesty."</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng wanted to say it was okay. Except for Wei Zhuang, he didn't care about the Liu Sha organization.</p><p></p><p>It's just a group of people gathered together.</p><p></p><p>Without Wei Zhuang, without a leader, Liu Sha is just a loose sand, nothing to fear.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, he heard Ying Chen's thoughts again.</p><p></p><p>[Wei Zhuang was really caught? In this case, Chi Lian will definitely not ignore it, but with the remaining few people of Liu Sha, it is impossible to rescue people from the Shi Ya Prison no matter how you think about it.]</p><p></p><p>[It seems that the people of Liu Sha are very likely to seek outside help, but who will they find?]</p><p></p><p>[The Mo Family? The Confucian Family? Or the Peasant Family? Chi Lian knows Zhang Liang, but the Confucian family will not put all their treasures on Zhang Liang. It is very likely that the Mo family will be persuaded by Zhang Liang.]</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ying Zheng's face instantly turned ugly.</p><p></p><p>What does this mean?</p><p></p><p>The Mo family, the Confucian family, and the Peasant family are all disloyal to the Great Qin?</p><p></p><p>Well, these martial artists, none of them are looking forward to the Great Qin's success?</p><p></p><p>One by one, they all have this kind of mentality?</p><p></p><p>PS: Please give flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thank you all!</p><p></p><p>Feilu Novel, Fei wants you to have a good read!</p>

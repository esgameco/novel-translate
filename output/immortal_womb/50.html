        <h1>Chapter 50</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After Zhao Gao left, Ying Zheng was about to go to Consort Shu's palace.</p><p></p><p>The eunuch reported: "Your Majesty, Li Si requests an audience."</p><p></p><p>For Li Si to request an audience at this time, there must be some important matter he wanted to discuss with him.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng said in a deep voice: "Let Li Si come in."</p><p></p><p>After Li Si entered, he had a worried look on his face and reported: "Your Majesty, the weather is unfavorable this year, and the grain harvest is poor. Many counties and prefectures are already unable to collect taxes."</p><p></p><p>"In some more severely affected counties and prefectures, the people have nothing to eat. It is said that they have started to eat tree bark to survive. If this situation continues, I'm afraid it may trigger a rebellion."</p><p></p><p>When Ying Zheng heard about the rebellion, he subconsciously associated it with the group of anti-Qin rebels, and felt a sense of aversion in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He snorted coldly: "If they can't even fill their stomachs, how would they have the strength to rebel."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he subconsciously wanted to say what he usually did: "If they really dare to rebel, then the army will suppress them."</p><p></p><p>However, just as he was about to say this, Ying Zheng suddenly thought of Ying Chen.</p><p></p><p>Under his rule, the great Qin always had anti-Qin rebels from time to time.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was partly because that group of people never gave up their rebellious hearts.</p><p></p><p>But among these reasons, could it be somewhat related to the fact that he always solved problems by fighting and killing?</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng suddenly wanted to know, if it were that brat, how would he solve this matter?</p><p></p><p>Would he have a better solution?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Ying Zheng swallowed his words, stood up, and said to Li Si, "You come with me."</p><p></p><p>In Consort Shu's palace, Ying Chen was taking advantage of the time to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he heard the news that Ying Zheng had brought Li Si over.</p><p></p><p>Although in the Qin era, they did not pay as much attention to the separation of men and women as the Confucians of later generations did, the rear palace still needed to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>Li Si was not a close guard like Zhang Han, he was an outer court official. With him here, Consort Shu wanted to avoid suspicion.</p><p></p><p>So after paying respects to Ying Zheng, Consort Shu retreated to the inner room next door.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, the distance in between was not far, and she could still hear the child's inner voice. Ying Zheng acquiesced to Consort Shu's actions.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the emperor bring him to the rear palace, Li Si was already extremely puzzled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng sat down and calmly said, "Li Si, repeat what you reported just now."</p><p></p><p>Li Si was instantly dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What did he mean? He wanted him to say it again?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that His Majesty forgot so quickly?</p><p></p><p>His Majesty was still in his prime, and his memory was already not very good?</p><p></p><p>Thousands of thoughts flashed through Li Si's mind, but he dared not express a single one.</p><p></p><p>He could only say respectfully, "Your Majesty, the grain harvest is poor this year. Not only can taxes not be collected, but the people also have nothing to eat."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Li Si looked at Ying Zheng expectantly, hoping to get a solution from him.</p><p></p><p>But to his disappointment,</p><p></p><p>After hearing his words, Ying Zheng closed his eyes with a calm expression. Except for his ears twitching, there was no other reaction.</p><p></p><p>In the inner chamber, Ying Chen, upon hearing about the people's suffering, couldn't help but sigh in his heart.</p><p></p><p>[The grain yield during this period is indeed pitifully low, with the yield per mu being only two to three hundred jin. It's a pity that high-yielding crops like corn, potatoes, and sweet potatoes are still far from being introduced.]</p><p></p><p>[Otherwise, with the capability of these crops, they can produce at least a thousand jin, and in a bumper harvest, several thousand to tens of thousands of jin of grain, which would greatly improve the lives of the people.]</p><p></p><p>[Speaking of which, with the size of the Shen Lou, it definitely has the ability to sail far. Giving it to those big liars from the Yin-Yang family is really a waste. If it were me, I would definitely put all my efforts into building the Shen Lou and then send it out to search for high-yielding grain crops.]</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing these words, Ying Zheng suddenly opened his eyes, sat up straight, and gripped the armrests of his chair, trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>What? Yield per mu of over a thousand jin? Even several thousand to tens of thousands of jin?</p><p></p><p>Did he hear it wrong?</p><p></p><p>Are there really grain crops in the world with such high yields?</p><p></p><p>And not just one kind?</p><p></p><p>How come he has never heard of them before?</p><p></p><p>Li Si saw Ying Zheng open his eyes with a shocked expression and thought something had happened. He asked doubtfully, "Your Majesty?"</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng came back to his senses and placed a hand on his chest, trying to calm his wildly beating heart.</p><p></p><p>This matter was too astonishing!</p><p></p><p>If someone else had told him that there were several crops that could produce ten times or even a hundred times the current grain yield, he would certainly not believe it.</p><p></p><p>However, the one who said these words was his own son, whose predictions had never been wrong!</p><p></p><p>Even if he didn't believe it, he had to believe it.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the construction of the Shen Lou must be accelerated!</p><p></p><p>They must go overseas to find those crops.</p><p></p><p>Corn, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and the like.</p><p></p><p>Not a single one could be missed; he wanted them all!</p><p></p><p>By then, the grain planted by the people would yield harvests of several thousand jin or even tens of thousands of jin.</p><p></p><p>Not only would they be able to eat their fill, but his tax revenue would also increase.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the granaries built in various counties wouldn't be able to hold so much grain.</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about the scene of granaries filled with grain made Ying Zheng's heart bloom with joy.</p><p></p><p>However, even if they could find the so-called high-yielding grain crops, that would be a matter for the future. The current problem still hadn't been solved.</p><p></p><p>The people were still starving at the moment.</p><p></p><p>How to fill their stomachs was a big problem.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Ying Zheng became worried again. He glanced at the inner chamber and began to sigh in a pretentious manner.</p><p></p><p>"This matter is indeed a headache. But distant water cannot quench present thirst. Where can I conjure up so much food to provide relief to the disaster victims?"</p><p></p><p>PS: Please give flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, and rewards.

        <h1>Chapter 46</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the Shi Ya Prison, the few people inside were still unaware of what had happened outside, let alone that Zhang Liang and the others had already infiltrated.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gai Nie and Wei Zhuang noticed something amiss.</p><p></p><p>They heard a considerable commotion coming from afar.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the sound grew louder and louder, and even started to come from nearby.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, they could even see the corridors outside the prison cell shaking!</p><p></p><p>Mo Yu Qilin looked at the drastically changing scene outside the cell in confusion and couldn't help but ask, "What's going on? Why are all the passages changing?"</p><p></p><p>Sheng Qi, accustomed to strange occurrences, said, "This is the Shi Ya Prison's Qimen Dunjia (mysterious gate changes) being activated. It seems that someone has broken into the Shi Ya Prison."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Mo Yu Qilin immediately looked at Wei Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>She understood better than anyone how much Liu Sha valued Wei Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>It must be Liu Sha's companions who had come to rescue them!</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang remained expressionless, quietly looking at the changing corridors outside.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, he was secretly worried about how Liu Sha and the others would break through this strange Qimen Dunjia.</p><p></p><p>The art of Qimen Dunjia was not something that could be easily mastered.</p><p></p><p>Among Liu Sha, there was no one who could master this ability.</p><p></p><p>This was the reason why he had insisted on coming alone in the first place.</p><p></p><p>Now, who exactly had come?</p><p></p><p>If it was Liu Sha, would they be able to decipher these mysterious gate changes?</p><p></p><p>Would they be able to overcome these layers of obstacles and find them?</p><p></p><p>Gai Nie was also very worried.</p><p></p><p>The few people waited anxiously in the prison cell.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the intense changes gradually became calmer.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the door outside the cell was smashed open.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang, along with Bai Feng and Dao Zhi, appeared in their cell just like that!</p><p></p><p>The few guards were knocked out before they could even counterattack.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang and Gai Nie were very surprised to see that the people who had come were Zhang Liang, Bai Feng, and Dao Zhi in this combination.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Zhang Liang?!"</p><p></p><p>"How did you get here?!"</p><p></p><p>Bai Feng was one thing, as he was from Liu Sha and it made sense for him to come and rescue Wei Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>But what was the deal with Zhang Liang and this Dao Zhi? How did they also come to Shi Ya Prison to rescue people?</p><p></p><p>Liu Sha and the Mo Family had a grudge, but from the looks of it, they were actually working together?!</p><p></p><p>Mo Yu Qilin and Wei Zhuang were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Gai Nie and Zhang Liang were friends, but he also didn't expect that he would take such a big risk to come and rescue him.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Gai Nie was very touched.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang swept his eyes over them, confirming that their injuries were not severe enough to affect their escape, and couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Now was not the time to explain the ins and outs of the situation to them.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang said concisely, "Now is not the time to talk. Quickly follow us..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Go!" </p><p></p><p>With that said, the three of them stepped forward to unlock the chains on their bodies and rescued Ge Nie, Wei Zhuang, and Mo Yuqilin from the prison cell.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang and Ge Nie stretched their bodies.</p><p></p><p>They retrieved their own swords. </p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhang Liang noticed Sheng Qi and asked everyone, "Who is this person? Do we need to rescue him?"</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang's eyes swept coldly over Sheng Qi. "No need to save him."</p><p></p><p>He had not forgotten Sheng Qi's earlier sarcastic remarks towards them. </p><p></p><p>Sheng Qi looked at the crowd calmly, and didn't seem to have any intention of asking them to save him either.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Ge Nie also did not speak up to meddle in other people's business.</p><p></p><p>Time was limited, and Zhang Liang did not want to waste it on a stranger.</p><p></p><p>So he began to lead them to retreat.</p><p></p><p>However, before they could escape.</p><p></p><p>A person approached them from afar. </p><p></p><p>It was none other than Jing Ni, the top assassin in the Luo Wang!</p><p></p><p>When Jing Ni saw that Ge Nie and the others had escaped from the prison.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, Jing Ni's face changed!</p><p></p><p>Even with the many changes of the Qimen Dunjia, they still found it!</p><p></p><p>Ge Nie, Wei Zhuang and the others had actually escaped!</p><p></p><p>The Luo Wang could not allow failure in the task they undertook this time!</p><p></p><p>She must capture them back.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Jing Ni immediately increased her speed and chased after them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that it was Jing Ni who came, the crowd realized that the previous operation to distract Yan Ri's attention had failed.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Yan Ri and the others had already discovered something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps after realizing that their goal was to break into the Si Ya Prison, they immediately separated from Jing Ni.</p><p></p><p>Jing Ni alone had actually escaped from the quicksand and personally came to pursue them!</p><p></p><p>They could not delay any longer and must leave immediately!</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang's face changed. "We've been discovered, let's go quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang looked at Jing Ni coldly, his hand already on his own sword, the Shark Tooth.</p><p></p><p>Invisibly, his killing intent had already spread out.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Wei Zhuang did not want to retreat.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he had the intention of taking action against Jing Ni.</p><p></p><p>The Luo Wang's schemes against him and the quicksand had already left a mark in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Ge Nie persuaded, "Xiao Zhuang, this is not the place to take action. Let's leave here first."</p><p></p><p>"The Qimen can change at any time. The longer we delay, the more disadvantageous it is for us."</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang retracted his killing intent and reluctantly accepted Ge Nie's persuasion.</p><p></p><p>The crowd then ignored Jing Ni and fled deeper into the Si Ya Prison.</p><p></p><p>According to the intelligence they obtained, once the Qimen change was activated, only there would be the true exit of Si Ya Prison.</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thank you to all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>The three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>

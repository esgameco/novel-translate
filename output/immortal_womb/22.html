        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The palace of Shu Fei was peaceful and quiet, unaware of the restless thoughts of various parties outside due to Shu Fei's promotion in rank.</p><p></p><p>In the past few days, because of Shu Fei's promotion, her treatment had risen to a new level.</p><p></p><p>The quality of her food, clothing, and daily necessities had reached a new height.</p><p></p><p>The palace maids and eunuchs who had survived in the harem until now were all shrewd individuals.</p><p></p><p>After learning about Shu Fei's promotion, they sent good things to her place like a flowing stream.</p><p></p><p>If they could serve Shu Fei satisfactorily and she mentioned them in front of the emperor, wouldn't glory and wealth follow?</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, if they ignored Shu Fei at this time and aroused her anger, at the very least, they would suffer setbacks. If they angered the emperor, they might not even be able to keep their lives.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, everyone was now trying to please Shu Fei. Even if they couldn't get any benefits, at least they wouldn't be resented by her.</p><p></p><p>Shu Fei had a simple mind and didn't think about so many twists and turns.</p><p></p><p>Without any major issues, her days were spent comfortably, without any worries.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen took advantage of this time to start cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Due to Shu Fei's promotion, the imperial energy in Ying Chen's body ushered in another surge.</p><p></p><p>The golden light spots were too numerous to count.</p><p></p><p>They circulated slowly through his body.</p><p></p><p>He quietly absorbed the imperial energy that was about to overflow.</p><p></p><p>Finally, under his cultivation, Ying Chen's realm reached the eighth level of the Imperial Qi Realm!</p><p></p><p>The strength and coverage of his divine sense had expanded significantly due to the advancement in his realm.</p><p></p><p>After this upgrade, his divine sense would perceive more things.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen was delighted that his realm had been elevated again in a short period.</p><p></p><p>Because he was much closer to the foundation establishment of imperial energy.</p><p></p><p>Once he broke through the foundation establishment, he could reshape his body with imperial energy at birth and accelerate his growth rate.</p><p></p><p>The advantage of this was that his body could grow up quickly, and he wouldn't have to be a babbling infant for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to sense Ying Chen moving around inside, Shu Fei rubbed her belly, thinking he was scared.</p><p></p><p>So she comforted the child in her belly in a soft voice.</p><p></p><p>"Baby, don't be afraid. No matter what happens, Mother Fei will protect you."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Shu Fei's childish words of comfort, Ying Chen felt very speechless.</p><p></p><p>It was too cheesy!</p><p></p><p>He felt goosebumps all over his body.</p><p></p><p>This was why he didn't want to start as a young child.</p><p></p><p>As a mentally mature person, he really couldn't stand being called "baby" in a squeaky voice.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that many people would treat him like a child in the future.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he would have to cooperate and act.</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it made him feel terrified.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Thus, Ying Chen became even more determined to break through to the Imperial Qi Foundation Realm as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>The palace maids and eunuchs in the Shu Consort Palace were all busy attending to the Shu Consort's daily life.</p><p></p><p>An hour ago, the Shu Consort discovered that the incense she used to calm the Emperor's mind was almost used up.</p><p></p><p>That incense was something that could soothe the Emperor when he had a headache, so it was very important.</p><p></p><p>She attached great importance to this matter and immediately sent someone to fetch it.</p><p></p><p>A palace maid named Ruyi took on this errand.</p><p></p><p>Ruyi went to get the incense that the Shu Consort wanted and was now on her way to the Shu Consort Palace.</p><p></p><p>The palace maids and eunuchs who passed by greeted her one after another when they saw her.</p><p></p><p>They also warmly asked if she needed any help.</p><p></p><p>Ruyi smiled back, politely declining their assistance.</p><p></p><p>She was a palace maid assigned to the Shu Consort Palace not long ago.</p><p></p><p>She originally thought that the mistress she was following was a consort who was not favored and was prepared to suffer here.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, during this period, the Emperor suddenly treated the Shu Consort differently.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he might not even visit once every ten days or half a month, but now he ran to the Shu Consort Palace every day.</p><p></p><p>Even when dealing with political affairs, he had to do it at the Shu Consort's place.</p><p></p><p>This was an unprecedented treatment for the women in the rear palace!</p><p></p><p>As the Shu Consort received the Emperor's favor, they, as subordinates, also rose with the tide.</p><p></p><p>Not only did they receive more monthly salary, but they were also given priority for any good things.</p><p></p><p>Even those who used to look down on her with their noses in the air now came to flatter and fawn on her.</p><p></p><p>So Ruyi had been in a very good mood recently.</p><p></p><p>She sincerely hoped that the Shu Consort could continue to be loved by the Emperor like this.</p><p></p><p>Ruyi was envisioning her wonderful future life when suddenly a young eunuch in front of her waved at her from behind a rockery.</p><p></p><p>He had an ingratiating smile on his face, as if he had something to ask of her.</p><p></p><p>There was an eight or nine out of ten chance that he was seeking her help with something, just like the others.</p><p></p><p>However, Ruyi did not mind.</p><p></p><p>She enjoyed the feeling of others needing her help.</p><p></p><p>Ruyi walked over.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as she arrived behind the rockery, the young eunuch suddenly turned into her appearance right in front of her!</p><p></p><p>Ruyi's eyes widened in shock as she pointed at the face that looked exactly like hers.</p><p></p><p>She was about to cry out in alarm, but unfortunately, the other party would not give her this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>In just an instant, Ruyi's vision went black, and she fainted.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, the fake Ruyi holding the incense walked out from behind the rockery.</p><p></p><p>Her expression was exactly the same as Ruyi's just now.</p><p></p><p>As if nothing had happened, she walked towards the Shu Consort Palace.</p><p></p><p>PS: Please give flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, and rewards.

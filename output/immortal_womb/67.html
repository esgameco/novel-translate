        <h1>Chapter 67</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang thought of the Shadow Guards and couldn't help but worry.</p><p></p><p>"The Shadow Guards are known for being as inseparable as a shadow, so they may have already infiltrated the Yujing Lake Medical Manor."</p><p></p><p>"When the time comes, will they take the opportunity to expose the location of the Mechanical City while we enter it?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Zhang Liang's concerns, the Mohist leader smiled faintly: "There's no need to worry about this problem. The Mohists naturally have a solution."</p><p></p><p>The Mohist Mechanical City took more than 300 years to build and has always been the Mohists' most mysterious fortress.</p><p></p><p>Both the interior and exterior are filled with traps, making it easy to defend but difficult to attack.</p><p></p><p>He was confident that even if outsiders knew the location, they wouldn't be able to enter.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhang Liang said no more and arranged for everyone to pack their things and begin preparing for the retreat.</p><p></p><p>Everyone packed useful items, weapons, food...</p><p></p><p>Especially the medicinal materials from Yujing Lake Medical Manor, which could save lives at critical moments and must be taken.</p><p></p><p>Soon, under the leadership of the Mohists, Zhang Liang, Liu Sha and the others retreated in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>In the shadows, several Shadow Guards followed from afar.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that since the day the Mohists successfully broke the prison, the Shadow Guards had been following them according to orders.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that this group of people had been staying at Yujing Lake Medical Manor and showed signs of staying for a long time,</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guards decisively decided to kill a Mohist disciple to cause panic among them and make them retreat to their true lair.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, after the death of that disciple was discovered, the Mohists took action again.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guards believed that this time they would truly uncover the real Mohist lair.</p><p></p><p>Each of them was in high spirits and extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Once this mission was completed, they would be the meritorious heroes who had made a great contribution!</p><p></p><p>However, as they followed behind the Mohists, they didn't dare to get too close.</p><p></p><p>They always maintained a distance from these people to avoid being discovered by the experts.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the few tracking Shadow Guards were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Because in plain sight, the enemies they were tracking actually entered the belly of a mechanical beast by the water and sank into the water!</p><p></p><p>It was one of the Mohists' Four Sacred Beasts, the Mechanical Black Tortoise.</p><p></p><p>It was an important part of the Mohist Mechanical City.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guards looked at each other. With this large group of people entering the mechanical beast in the water, how could they continue tracking?</p><p></p><p>Even if they swam down, they would be discovered and then attacked.</p><p></p><p>With no other choice, the Shadow Guards could only return to report.</p><p></p><p>In the Xianyang Palace.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng looked tired after finishing the morning court session.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't slept all night, always feeling uneasy about not hearing the familiar heartbeat.</p><p></p><p>Although the imperial physician said the child was very healthy, Ying Zheng couldn't help but let his imagination run wild.</p><p></p><p>What if something happened to this child? What about his method for immortality?</p><p></p><p>What about the future of his Great Qin?</p><p></p><p>From now on...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was no one who could answer his questions anymore. </p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Ying Zheng felt anxious and uncomfortable, as if a hundred claws were scratching at his heart.</p><p></p><p>It was not until close to dawn, when he heard Ying Chen's inner voice again, that he finally let out a long sigh of relief and put his mind at ease.</p><p></p><p>With no more worries weighing on his mind, he finally felt in the mood to hold morning court.</p><p></p><p>Now that morning court had ended, just as Ying Zheng was thinking of going back to catch up on some sleep, the eunuch reported: "Your Majesty, Zhang Han, the commander of the Shadow Guards, requests an audience."</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng wanted to refuse at first, thinking that whatever the matter was, it could wait until after he had caught up on his sleep. </p><p></p><p>But suddenly, a thought stirred in his mind, giving rise to another idea.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han was a perceptive man.</p><p></p><p>Since last night, he had been busy dealing with the matter of the assassin in Consort Shu's palace.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han was aware of this, and also knew that he had not slept all night.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, for Zhang Han to seek an audience now despite the pressure, it must be for an important matter.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Ying Zheng sat back down.</p><p></p><p>"Let Zhang Han come in."</p><p></p><p>The eunuch went out to summon Zhang Han according to the order.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Zhang Han entered.</p><p></p><p>His face showed a rare look of relaxation.</p><p></p><p>He reported: "Your Majesty, the Shadow Guards have discovered the whereabouts of the Mohist rebels. After a brief stay at Mirror Lake Medical Manor, they have now gone to the Mohist Mechanical City."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the Mohist rebels have entered the mechanical bastion within the Mohist Mechanical City, and the Shadow Guards can no longer track them."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the news brought by Zhang Han, Ying Zheng was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"To think that the location of Mirror Lake Medical Manor has already been found, excellent, excellent! Those anti-Qin rebels have one less place to hide now."</p><p></p><p>Mirror Lake Medical Manor had always enjoyed a good reputation in the jianghu. It was said that the medical immortals inside possessed superb medical skills and could heal even the most severe injuries.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng had long wanted to find Mirror Lake Medical Manor.</p><p></p><p>Because the medical sect and the Mohist sect had always been close.</p><p></p><p>Many of the jianghu people saved by Mirror Lake Medical Manor would join the Mohists under their influence.</p><p></p><p>Even if they did not join the Mohists, they would provide them with a lot of intelligence out of gratitude for the medical immortals.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Mirror Lake Medical Manor could be said to be an outpost of the Mohists.</p><p></p><p>It had won over many talents and information for the Mohists.</p><p></p><p>But Mirror Lake Medical Manor was too mysterious, and its location could not be found at all.</p><p></p><p>Being able to find Mirror Lake Medical Manor this time was a big gain.</p><p></p><p>As for the disappearance of the Mohists in the water, Ying Zheng did not care.</p><p></p><p>Since a huge mechanical beast had appeared, it meant that the location of the Mohist Mechanical City was not far away, and it was just a matter of finding it.</p><p></p><p>No matter what kind of place it was, as long as he knew where it was, he could send troops to level it.</p><p></p><p>Let these anti-Qin rebels have no more places to hide in the future!</p>

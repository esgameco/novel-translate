        <h1>Chapter 56</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>After Hu Hai left.</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri returned to the mansion and handed the note to Zhao Gao.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao didn't even look at it, directly crumpling it into a ball and throwing it away.</p><p></p><p>He said with a look of disdain, "Did Hu Hai come because of the matter of Shu Fei being promoted to a beauty?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri nodded.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao showed an expression of "as expected". </p><p></p><p>That waste Hu Hai would come to him just for this matter.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he encountered the matter of Shu Fei's promotion, he was like a firecracker that would ignite with a single touch.</p><p></p><p>Not thinking about things at a deeper level, he would just come to him clamoring for him to find a way to get rid of Shu Fei.</p><p></p><p>He was already fed up with Hu Hai's childish temperament and just wanted some peace and quiet for a while.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao looked at Yan Ri and asked, "What do you think about Shu Fei's promotion?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri thought for a moment and replied, "His Majesty would not do this for no reason. This represents that His Majesty values Shu Fei very much. However, there are indeed strange things about Shu Fei everywhere."</p><p></p><p>"Regarding the matter of the grain shortage this time, it is said that Li Si originally only reported it to His Majesty alone. The strange thing is that His Majesty actually took Li Si to Shu Fei's palace, and then had Li Si report the matter again."</p><p></p><p>"What's even stranger is that His Majesty then came up with the method of catching fish and the method of making ice with saltpeter, and then Shu Fei's rank was promoted to a beauty."</p><p></p><p>The complete process had already been recorded by the eyes and ears of their network and passed on to them.</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri had already read this intelligence several times.</p><p></p><p>He could sense that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>But there were too many strange things in it, making it difficult for him to grasp the key points for a while.</p><p></p><p>For example, it was already strange enough for His Majesty to deliberately take Li Si to Shu Fei's palace.</p><p></p><p>Why did he also have Li Si report again?</p><p></p><p>And why did His Majesty come up with insights to deal with the grain shortage problem so quickly afterwards?</p><p></p><p>He had never heard of His Majesty doing any research on ice making before.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao sneered, "Were the methods of catching fish and making ice really thought up by His Majesty? If so, why did His Majesty need to go to Shu Fei's palace? Couldn't he just tell Li Si directly?"</p><p></p><p>Reminded by this, Yan Ri frowned, "You mean, what Jing Ni said was true? There really is another person behind His Majesty? And that person is in Shu Fei's palace?"</p><p></p><p>Jing Ni had long believed that there was a master behind His Majesty, influencing His Majesty's decisions.</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri agreed with this point.</p><p></p><p>But to say that this person was in Shu Fei's palace, Yan Ri always felt that it was not very realistic.</p><p></p><p>That was the rear palace, a place full of women.</p><p></p><p>If His Majesty really had a person to strategize for him, wouldn't it be more convenient for him to openly accompany His Majesty in the study or in the court?</p><p></p><p>Why put the person in the rear palace?</p><p></p><p>Having to run to the rear palace every time something happened would be so inconvenient.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't understand it.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao...</p><p></p><p>(Translation ends abruptly as the excerpt also ends abruptly mid-sentence)</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At first, he also thought so, but now he has changed his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Although it's incredible, based on these recent events, this possibility is quite likely. Moreover, this person should have a significant relationship with Concubine Shu, otherwise our Emperor would not have frequently promoted Concubine Shu's rank."</p><p></p><p>Especially the timing of promoting Concubine Shu's rank was concentrated right after those strange events occurred. </p><p></p><p>It's hard not to associate this with the meaning of a reward.</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri hesitated for a moment: "Is there a possibility that the person behind the Emperor is actually Concubine Shu herself?"</p><p></p><p>This was the most reasonable explanation Yan Ri could think of.</p><p></p><p>This explains why the Emperor did not bring the expert behind him to the court to serve as an official, but hid her in the harem instead.</p><p></p><p>Because Concubine Shu is a woman, and also his concubine, she cannot serve as an official.</p><p></p><p>However, this raises even more questions.</p><p></p><p>For example, if Concubine Shu's skills are so powerful, why did she have such a miserable life in her early years, being only a low-ranking concubine? </p><p></p><p>Even her pregnancy was accidental.</p><p></p><p>Also, where did Concubine Shu learn all these skills from?</p><p></p><p>Did she come to the Emperor's side by chance, or with some purpose in mind?</p><p></p><p>The mysteries are piling up.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao shook his head: "No one can confirm the specifics now, but didn't the Emperor just change the purpose of the Mirage?"</p><p></p><p>"That group of Yin-Yang masters definitely won't give up easily. Pass on the order to keep a close eye on any movements from the Yin-Yang clan, not missing the slightest hint!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri accepted the order and left.</p><p></p><p>Night fell, and Concubine Shu's palace was in complete silence.</p><p></p><p>Concubine Shu had already gone to bed and quickly fell asleep.</p><p></p><p>The palace maids and eunuchs on night duty were also drowsy.</p><p></p><p>In this silent night, only Ying Chen was still in high spirits.</p><p></p><p>He was continuously strengthening his own spirit.</p><p></p><p>If you ask him why he chose to cultivate at this time, it's not because Ying Chen is hardworking and diligent.</p><p></p><p>Rather, he discovered that this surge of imperial energy was a bit unusual.</p><p></p><p>Usually, the imperial energy eruption is like a volcanic eruption. After reaching its peak, it will subside for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>The imperial energy will also decrease accordingly.</p><p></p><p>But this imperial energy eruption was completely different.</p><p></p><p>Rather than a volcanic eruption, it's more like a mighty river.</p><p></p><p>Not only does it continuously rush forward, but it's also increasing in volume.</p><p></p><p>As if the previous eruption was just a little prelude, far from the peak.</p><p></p><p>How could Ying Chen miss such a great opportunity for cultivation?</p><p></p><p>Of course, he had to continue absorbing the imperial energy, taking advantage of this excellent opportunity to improve his realm.</p><p></p><p>Absorbing the abundant imperial energy, Ying Chen began to look forward to it.</p><p></p><p>Who knows what realm he can cultivate to this time?</p>

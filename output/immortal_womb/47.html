        <h1>Chapter 47</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Soon, the group arrived at the deepest cell in the Shi Ya Prison.</p><p></p><p>This was the place mentioned in the intelligence, the exit of Shi Ya Prison.</p><p></p><p>But according to the information, they still needed to find the character "Wang" (望).</p><p></p><p>For a while, the few people had no clue about finding the character "Wang".</p><p></p><p>This was also part of the intelligence, something they had never encountered in reality.</p><p></p><p>How could they find it in a short time?</p><p></p><p>They searched anxiously, but still couldn't find it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Jing Ni (惊鲵) that they had left behind had already caught up.</p><p></p><p>It was getting closer and closer to them.</p><p></p><p>Before long, it would completely catch up with them!</p><p></p><p>At the critical moment, Wei Zhuang decisively drew out his Shark Tooth (鲨齿): "You continue to search, I will go stop the Jing Ni."</p><p></p><p>In this trip into Shi Ya Prison, because of the big loss from Luo Wang (罗网), he had been holding a belly full of anger.</p><p></p><p>Just now, if Gai Nie hadn't stopped him, he would have stayed to fight the Jing Ni.</p><p></p><p>But what Wei Zhuang didn't expect was that as soon as he gathered his internal strength, he felt a sharp pain in his body!</p><p></p><p>Immediately followed by a heat in his throat, he directly spat out a mouthful of fresh blood!</p><p></p><p>Gai Nie immediately stepped forward to support Wei Zhuang. Upon checking his condition, his face greatly changed: "Not good, Xiao Zhuang has been poisoned!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang's heart sank. He didn't expect that Shi Ya Prison would use such despicable means.</p><p></p><p>Poisoning is the most despised practice among the Jianghu people!</p><p></p><p>Was it because they were wary of the strength of Wei Zhuang and Gai Nie, so they made such a move?</p><p></p><p>The person who came up with this plan was extremely meticulous in their thinking!</p><p></p><p>No wonder there were no Yin Yang Masters or Zhang Heng and other Shadow Guards near their cell!</p><p></p><p>That's because it was unnecessary!</p><p></p><p>The three people in the cell were poisoned without their own knowledge.</p><p></p><p>It can be imagined that even if someone came to rescue the three of them and encountered pursuers along the way,</p><p></p><p>The three would not be able to resist using their internal strength to go and fight.</p><p></p><p>In that case, the three of them would be poisoned.</p><p></p><p>It would also implicate the group of people who came to rescue them.</p><p></p><p>At that time, not only would the prison break plan fail, their large group of people would instead be caught and imprisoned!</p><p></p><p>What a vicious poisoning scheme!</p><p></p><p>They almost fell for it!</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang felt a lingering fear in his heart and immediately instructed Gai Nie: "You must not recklessly use your internal strength now. If my guess is correct, you and Mo Yu Qilin are the same, you should also be poisoned."</p><p></p><p>"You three focus on finding the 'Wang' character, leave the Jing Ni to me to stop!"</p><p></p><p>With that said, Zhang Liang headed towards the Jing Ni without waiting for the others to object.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the person coming was Zhang Liang, Jing Ni was very surprised.</p><p></p><p>But she adapted quickly, countering the moves, and soon started fighting with Zhang Liang.</p><p></p><p>Originally Gai Nie was very worried about Zhang Liang</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Would they be unable to withstand the attack of Jingni?</p><p></p><p>However, in the confrontation with Gai Nie, Zhang Liang did not fall behind at all.</p><p></p><p>He even seemed to be evenly matched with Jingni.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Gai Nie put his mind at ease.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of the precious time Zhang Liang bought for them, the group began to urgently search for the character "Wang".</p><p></p><p>Finally, Dao Zhi found the character "Wang".</p><p></p><p>Everyone was overjoyed and immediately called out to Zhang Liang.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang made a fake move, successfully deceiving Jingni, and escaped from the Devouring Fang Prison with the others.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Devouring Fang Prison.</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian and the others were besieging Yan Ri.</p><p></p><p>Although Yan Ri was powerful, facing the siege of the Flowing Sand group alone, he inevitably struggled a bit.</p><p></p><p>In his plan, he and Jingni would have been enough to deal with these few people from Flowing Sand.</p><p></p><p>But midway through the fight, he noticed something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>Flowing Sand and the others kept trying to lure them away.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he and Jingni wanted to stop, they would deliberately reveal openings to entice their attacks.</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri decisively let Jingni go back to support, holding off Flowing Sand and creating an opportunity for Jingni.</p><p></p><p>After Jingni left, under the intensive attacks of Flowing Sand, Yan Ri was wounded.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their attacks were effective, Flowing Sand and the others launched even more frenzied attacks.</p><p></p><p>However, after fighting for so long, Chi Lian and the others were not unscathed either.</p><p></p><p>Almost everyone had light to moderate injuries.</p><p></p><p>One against many, yet still not falling behind, Yan Ri's strength was evident.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were locked in a stalemate, a firework signal exploded in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri instantly felt something was wrong and looked at the expressions of Flowing Sand and the others.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, upon seeing the fireworks, Chi Lian's eyes lit up and he said, "They succeeded! Let's retreat quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the faces of the Flowing Sand group all showed joy.</p><p></p><p>From this moment, the situation of attack and defense changed!</p><p></p><p>Flowing Sand, who was originally attacking frantically, began to withdraw their offensive, wanting to leave.</p><p></p><p>And Yan Ri tried to hold back Flowing Sand and the others.</p><p></p><p>But with him alone, it was impossible to keep so many people from Flowing Sand.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Flowing Sand group disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Helpless, Yan Ri could only return for now.</p><p></p><p>However, when Yan Ri returned to the entrance of the Devouring Fang Prison, what met his eyes were the heavily wounded Six Sword Slaves.</p><p></p><p>Every one of the Six Sword Slaves was injured, with Luan Shen and Wang Liang directly killed by Mo Mei's sword.</p><p></p><p>This sight made Yan Ri so angry that the veins on his forehead throbbed erratically.</p><p></p><p>Unable to catch his breath, he directly spat out a mouthful of fresh blood!</p><p></p><p>This time, the Luo Web suffered a huge loss!</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thanks to all the esteemed readers!</p><p></p><p>Three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 57</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Just as Ying Chen was immersed in his cultivation, two slender figures clad in night clothes were approaching the Palace of Concubine Shu. These two were none other than the two elders of the Yin-Yang Sect - Da Siming and Shao Siming.</p><p></p><p>The two had received orders from Dong Huangtaiyi to go to Concubine Shu's palace to investigate the reason behind Ying Zheng's frequent strange behavior. Dong Huangtaiyi and others like Zhao Gao were convinced that the person influencing His Majesty's decisions was in Concubine Shu's palace.</p><p></p><p>During the day, the palace was bustling with people, and it was inconvenient for His Majesty to be here, so they took advantage of the night to act. They even sent two people out of caution, both to ensure each other's safety and to make sure that if something unexpected happened, at least one person could bring the message back.</p><p></p><p>The two avoided the many guards in the rear palace and lightly landed on the roof. Although there were many guards here, the two had strong martial arts skills and managed to break in without being discovered.</p><p></p><p>Da Siming whispered, "This is the rear palace, don't hurt anyone rashly. Focus on gathering information." Shao Siming nodded, indicating that she understood.</p><p></p><p>Their goal this time was to find out as much as possible where the person who was strategizing for Ying Zheng was located. Concubine Shu's palace was not large, and there shouldn't be many places for people to live. One night was enough for them to find clues.</p><p></p><p>The two took advantage of the fact that no one was around and floated down to Concubine Shu's palace, landing without making a sound. No one in Concubine Shu's palace noticed anything unusual.</p><p></p><p>Da Siming pointed in one direction, indicating that she was going to walk this way. Shao Siming instantly understood her meaning and turned to go in the other direction. The two split into two paths, one left and one right, and searched Concubine Shu's palace from two directions.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ying Chen was cultivating when his heart suddenly began to palpitate. He had a strong intuition that something foreign was rapidly approaching his vicinity. In the middle of the night, coming straight to Concubine Shu's palace, no matter how you looked at it, it meant ill intentions.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen was not careless. He exited his cultivation state and continuously expanded his spiritual sense to perceive a larger range. Before long, he discovered two figures searching around Concubine Shu's palace. Although they were disguised, the two had slender and delicate figures, clearly women at a glance. They were looking for something.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen was unhappy. He was in the midst of cultivation and was suddenly interrupted. Anyone would be in a bad mood. In a bad mood, naturally one would want to find something to vent on. These sneaky people, hiding their heads and showing their tails, did they really think Concubine Shu's palace was a place they could come and go as they pleased? It was a bit too arrogant and conceited.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that a Jingkui and an Ink Jade Qilin had not given them enough...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Lesson.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he now possessed the ability to separate his spirit from his body, which was incomparable to before.</p><p></p><p>Today, he must teach these people a lesson!</p><p></p><p>To make them understand that the Shu Fei Palace is not a place they can break into at will!</p><p></p><p>To make them never dare to come and be presumptuous again!</p><p></p><p>He was not a master with such a good temper.</p><p></p><p>He would not tolerate these clowns jumping around in his own home again and again.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Ying Chen used his ability to separate his spirit from his body.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a baby emitting a golden glow appeared above Shu Fei.</p><p></p><p>Shu Fei did not notice anything, she was still immersed in her own dreamland, sleeping sweetly.</p><p></p><p>This time, it was different from Ying Chen's previous tentative use of his ability.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had more imperial energy in his body and used a more powerful method.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen clenched his chubby fists and found that he had no substantial feeling for his body.</p><p></p><p>It looked like it would disappear at any time.</p><p></p><p>But he himself could understand that the reality was completely opposite.</p><p></p><p>In fact, now he could call upon the vast imperial energy in his body, not at all as fragile as it appeared.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had a feeling that in this state, his connection with heaven and earth was more unobstructed.</p><p></p><p>After separating from his body, he no longer needed another medium to connect with heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>This led to him now being able to easily mobilize the power of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>No matter what forces existed between heaven and earth, he could easily access them.</p><p></p><p>Heaven, earth, nature, everything became his partner.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ying Chen had an idea.</p><p></p><p>Almost at the moment when this idea arose, the water in the teapot on the table began to slowly overflow from the spout.</p><p></p><p>However, the overflowing water did not fall with gravity, but flowed in the air.</p><p></p><p>Then it slowly gathered in front of Ying Chen, forming a sphere.</p><p></p><p>The sphere formed by the water was extremely round, as if it were a natural masterpiece.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen reached out to touch the water sphere.</p><p></p><p>The water sphere kept changing shape, and a few seconds later, the originally round water sphere gradually condensed into a water sword.</p><p></p><p>The blade of the water sword looked shimmering, but it was extremely sharp!</p><p></p><p>Compared with those legendary treasured swords and golden blades, the sharpness of the water sword was even better.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his work, Ying Chen nodded with satisfaction. </p><p></p><p>Although this weapon could not be called perfect, it was more than enough to deal with those two people.</p><p></p><p>Next, it was time for him to test the practicality of this water sword.</p><p></p><p>He hoped that those two people would not collapse with one blow and disappoint him.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the room next door, the two intruders were getting closer and closer.</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thank you to all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>Feilu Novel, Fei wants you to have a good read!</p>

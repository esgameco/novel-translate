        <h1>Chapter 58</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the room next to Ying Chen, there were rustling sounds.</p><p></p><p>It could almost be confirmed that two people were there at that moment.</p><p></p><p>The Great Siming and the Lesser Siming had met up.</p><p></p><p>The two had already searched the periphery and found nothing.</p><p></p><p>There were no rooms of any special people outside, so it could be basically determined that the person they were looking for was no longer there.</p><p></p><p>The only place left to search was Concubine Shu's bedchamber.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps that mysterious person was living in Concubine Shu's bedchamber.</p><p></p><p>Having made up their minds, the two gestured to each other and were about to enter Concubine Shu's bedchamber.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ying Chen appeared above the two through the wall.</p><p></p><p>The Lesser Siming was the first to notice something was wrong, and she looked up.</p><p></p><p>She saw a baby emitting a golden glow all over its body, floating in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, this scene was so abrupt.</p><p></p><p>But there was not a hint of evil aura on the suddenly appearing baby.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, the baby's body was flowing with golden light, like a god suddenly born into the world in mythology.</p><p></p><p>It had a kind of transcendent divinity.</p><p></p><p>It did not make people feel evil in their hearts, only heartfelt admiration and respect.</p><p></p><p>The baby slowly opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>Those eyes, as black as ink, stared at the two people below.</p><p></p><p>That gaze contained a strong sense of inquiry and warning.</p><p></p><p>There was no pure innocence of a naive baby at all!</p><p></p><p>Such a scene had already exceeded the inherent cognition of the Lesser Siming for so many years.</p><p></p><p>She stared with wide eyes, her mouth slightly open, looking at the scene before her in a daze, not knowing what to do.</p><p></p><p>This baby was looking at them! He was intelligent!</p><p></p><p>Did he understand that the two of them were intruders?!</p><p></p><p>No, before that, who exactly was this baby?!</p><p></p><p>Why did he appear here?!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A series of questions surged into the Lesser Siming's mind.</p><p></p><p>Almost burning through her brain.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, it even caused her whole person to become like a wooden puppet.</p><p></p><p>She could only stand there, staring blankly at the baby in the air, unable to move.</p><p></p><p>The Great Siming did not notice the Lesser Siming's abnormality.</p><p></p><p>She was still pondering with her head down and her chin in her hand about how to proceed next.</p><p></p><p>This room also did not reveal any valuable clues.</p><p></p><p>Should they go directly to Concubine Shu's room to investigate next, or should they continue to search other rooms?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Great Siming, who was thinking about the problem, suddenly felt her sleeve move.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the Lesser Siming.</p><p></p><p>It was the Lesser Siming's hand tugging at her sleeve.</p><p></p><p>The Great Siming did not understand what she meant. She looked at the Lesser Siming and asked, "Lesser Siming, why are you pulling me?"</p><p></p><p>The Lesser Siming's gaze was fixed straight up at the sky, not knowing what she was looking at.</p><p></p><p>She stretched out her slender jade finger and pointed to the night sky.</p><p></p><p>The Great Siming looked in the direction she was pointing.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>With just one glance, her beautiful eyes instantly widened.</p><p></p><p>What is this?!</p><p></p><p>A baby?!</p><p></p><p>Seeing that strange sight, Da Siming instinctively took two steps back. </p><p></p><p>Her hands trembled as she pointed at the baby, her mouth agape, not knowing what to say for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"This... what is this? What, when did it appear?" </p><p></p><p>Da Siming stammered through this sentence, her tongue tied.</p><p></p><p>However, no one answered her question.</p><p></p><p>Shao Siming had no idea either.</p><p></p><p>She herself had just discovered it and had no clue when this baby had arrived.</p><p></p><p>As for what exactly this baby was, she was even more clueless.</p><p></p><p>The two fell into silence for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Da Siming was the first to lose patience and decided to make a move on the baby to probe the situation.</p><p></p><p>This baby had suddenly appeared and had already discovered them.</p><p></p><p>What if it let out a cry or shout, attracting others?!</p><p></p><p>It was better for them to take the initiative and test it out first.</p><p></p><p>After all, the other party was just a baby. Perhaps it could be easily dealt with.</p><p></p><p>In a brief instant, thoughts rapidly turned in Da Siming's mind. A burst of energy appeared in her hand and shot towards the baby floating in midair!</p><p></p><p>But even if she was going to make a move, Da Siming didn't forget her identity as an intruder.</p><p></p><p>She didn't use any Yin-Yang family techniques, but only an ordinary burst of energy.</p><p></p><p>Even such an ordinary energy, if an average person were to come into contact with it, would result in either death or disability.</p><p></p><p>But this move was completely insufficient in Ying Chen's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He used the water sword he had just created, appearing in front of him. With a slight wave, it directly slashed through the energy!</p><p></p><p>Da Siming and Shao Siming exchanged glances.</p><p></p><p>The next second, without a word, the two fled the room in tacit understanding!</p><p></p><p>From that previous strike, they had both discovered one thing.</p><p></p><p>This little fellow who looked like a baby had a strength that was definitely not weak!</p><p></p><p>It was not an opponent they could easily deal with.</p><p></p><p>Since their whereabouts had been discovered and they couldn't quickly resolve it,</p><p></p><p>there was no need to continue. Continuing would bring trouble if it attracted the Shadow Guards or Ying Zheng.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the two decisively choose to flee, Ying Chen was unhurried.</p><p></p><p>Now the movement of his divine sense was much more convenient than his physical body.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't afraid at all of the distance they ran.</p><p></p><p>He directly disappeared from the room.</p><p></p><p>When he reappeared in midair, he was already blocking the path of the two Yin-Yang family women.</p><p></p><p>Without any warning, he suddenly appeared in front of them like this!</p><p></p><p>The two Yin-Yang family women abruptly halted their steps.</p><p></p><p>They looked at the figure in midair in disbelief. </p><p></p><p>What movement technique was this? It was as if he appeared out of thin air?</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thanks to all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>Feilu Novels, Fei wants you to have a good read!</p>

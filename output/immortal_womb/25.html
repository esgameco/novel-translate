        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The golden sun sets in the west, and the round moon rises as the night quietly descends.</p><p></p><p>Moyu Qilin finally waits for the moment to take action.</p><p></p><p>She immediately changes into clothes convenient for action, eager to take the initiative.</p><p></p><p>Moyu Qilin begins to scout the surroundings, with the Shu Fei Palace as the center.</p><p></p><p>Shu Fei's rank was only Changshi until recently, so naturally, the palace she resides in is not in a good location.</p><p></p><p>The concubines around her are of similar rank to Shu Fei, and none of them are favored.</p><p></p><p>The eunuchs and palace maids serving the unfavored concubines are very few.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after Shu Fei gained favor recently, the palace maids and eunuchs generally go to ingratiate themselves with her.</p><p></p><p>So the presence of the surrounding concubines is even lower.</p><p></p><p>Basically, as soon as night falls, they turn off the lights and go to sleep, and no one will come out.</p><p></p><p>This is convenient for Moyu Qilin to act.</p><p></p><p>She can search the nearby palaces extensively.</p><p></p><p>With her skills and disguise ability, it can be said that it is like entering an uninhabited place.</p><p></p><p>She can freely explore every palace nearby.</p><p></p><p>Almost at the same time as Moyu Qilin's actions, Ying Chen's divine sense is released and locked onto her.</p><p></p><p>Closely watching her movements.</p><p></p><p>At first, the palaces Moyu Qilin explores are all nearby.</p><p></p><p>But soon, as the scope of Moyu Qilin's search expands, she is about to escape the coverage of Ying Chen's divine sense.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen recalls the operation of condensing divine sense into needles during the day and condenses his divine sense into threads.</p><p></p><p>Extending the threads outward.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, Moyu Qilin's blurry figure becomes clear again.</p><p></p><p>His divine sense can continue to cover outward.</p><p></p><p>It is indeed feasible. In this way, the range he can see will be much larger.</p><p></p><p>He never thought that this experimental operation of his would actually succeed.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen is delighted in his heart, feeling that he has found more ways to use his power.</p><p></p><p>Now, Moyu Qilin is under his divine sense, with nowhere to hide.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen has nothing to do and begins to carefully observe and study Moyu Qilin's disguise ability.</p><p></p><p>Moyu Qilin's disguise ability is very useful in obtaining intelligence.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for him seeing through Moyu Qilin's disguise in advance.</p><p></p><p>If it were someone else in the world of Qin, they would probably be deceived by Moyu Qilin's disguise.</p><p></p><p>Thinking like this, unknowingly, Ying Chen is deconstructing the technique Moyu Qilin uses to disguise herself as others.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Ying Chen feels a sudden change in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly feels that he can also achieve this kind of disguise.</p><p></p><p>It is his extremely strong, heaven-defying comprehension ability that is playing its role.</p><p></p><p>Allowing him to comprehend the skill of "Thousand Transformations".</p><p></p><p>His "Thousand Transformations" is different from the superficial changes brought about by Moyu Qilin's disguise.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He could use his own power to completely change his appearance. </p><p></p><p>This change was a true transformation, including his voice, breath, and temperament.</p><p></p><p>It could allow a person to completely become someone else.</p><p></p><p>His ability in this regard was even more terrifying than Mo Yuqilin's ability!</p><p></p><p>At this time, Mo Yuqilin arrived at an uninhabited palace chamber. </p><p></p><p>The place was covered in dust, and the cobwebs had formed a thick layer.</p><p></p><p>It was clearly a long-abandoned place that no one had visited for years.</p><p></p><p>She took a rough look around and, finding no clues, was about to leave.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen was not going to wait any longer. This was the perfect time and place.</p><p></p><p>He used the skill he had acquired, transmitting his voice in secret.</p><p></p><p>"You dare to trespass in the rear palace? You're very bold!"</p><p></p><p>In the quiet night, this voice exploded like a clap of thunder next to Mo Yuqilin's ear!</p><p></p><p>Startled, Mo Yuqilin said, "Who's there?"</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen ignored her question. </p><p></p><p>Instead, he continued to interrogate Mo Yuqilin: "Speak, who sent you?"</p><p></p><p>The instant she heard the voice, Mo Yuqilin began searching for the speaker's location.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, no matter how she searched, she could not find the slightest trace.</p><p></p><p>Apart from herself, there was no sign of anyone else's presence nearby!</p><p></p><p>How could this be?</p><p></p><p>Who on earth was the one speaking?</p><p></p><p>Unable to find Ying Chen's location, Mo Yuqilin began to panic.</p><p></p><p>Who exactly was the other party?</p><p></p><p>Despite clearly hearing a voice, why could she not sense anyone's presence at all?</p><p></p><p>There was actually such a master hidden in the rear palace, yet she had not detected them at all!</p><p></p><p>Was this possible?</p><p></p><p>Alarm bells rang in Mo Yuqilin's heart, but on the surface, she pretended to be an ordinary palace maid in a panic.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it? Who is speaking?"</p><p></p><p>"This servant is just a lowly palace maid from Consort Shu's palace. I took a wrong turn and can't find my way back."</p><p></p><p>"My lord, please don't frighten this servant. I will leave right away."</p><p></p><p>She acted very engrossed in the role, even adding a sob to her voice.</p><p></p><p>She vividly portrayed a timid little palace maid.</p><p></p><p>If one truly did not know her background, they might have been fooled by her current act.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this was all a pointless act in front of Ying Chen's blind eyes.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen sneered mockingly, "Is that so? The great Mo Yuqilin, number one assassin of Han, took a wrong turn?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Yuqilin was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Her pupils constricted, and her heart nearly stopped beating!</p><p></p><p>What was going on?</p><p></p><p>Who on earth was this person?</p><p></p><p>Why did they know her true identity?</p><p></p><p>Was her identity exposed?</p>

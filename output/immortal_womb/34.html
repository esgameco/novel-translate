        <div class="content">
            <p>In the Devouring Fang Prison.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han, Moon Goddess, Star Soul, Great Director of Destiny, and Lesser Director of Destiny were standing guard outside Ge Nie's cell.</p><p></p><p>Star Soul marveled at the layout of the Devouring Fang Prison, saying, "Would that Weizhang really dare to come to such a terrifying place?"</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he doubted the Emperor's decision.</p><p></p><p>He just felt that any sane person would not choose to break into such a place.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han said expressionlessly, "Since His Majesty has arranged it this way, he must have his reasons. We just need to follow His Majesty's orders."</p><p></p><p>As the commander of the Shadow Guards, Zhang Han unconditionally obeyed the Emperor's orders.</p><p></p><p>Even if he himself believed that Weizhang would not come, an order was an order, and no mistakes were allowed.</p><p></p><p>He just had to play his role well.</p><p></p><p>Moon Goddess, recalling the recent abnormalities, had other thoughts in her mind.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the ambush for Ge Nie, the recent papermaking techniques, or the matter of the elixirs, they all showed that His Majesty was very different from the past.</p><p></p><p>So it was not certain whether all of this was really arranged by His Majesty.</p><p></p><p>But she only dared to think this in her heart; she could never say it out loud.</p><p></p><p>Ge Nie noticed Zhang Han and those Yin-Yang masters who had captured him, and a bad premonition arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He frowned directly and asked Zhang Han, "What are you all gathering at the Devouring Fang Prison for?"</p><p></p><p>Facing Ge Nie, Zhang Han smiled slightly and replied, "Naturally, we are here waiting for Weizhang to take the bait."</p><p></p><p>They already knew that Weizhang was coming to the Devouring Fang Prison?!</p><p></p><p>They were gathering here now to ambush Weizhang!</p><p></p><p>Not good! If Weizhang really came here, he would be in danger!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Ge Nie's face instantly turned grim.</p><p></p><p>Mo Yuqilin, who also heard Zhang Han's answer, was even more shocked.</p><p></p><p>She knew the inside story of the cooperation with Luowang, so she understood the gravity of the situation even more.</p><p></p><p>And she understood Weizhang.</p><p></p><p>With her captured, Weizhang would definitely have Luowang provide intelligence and come to the Devouring Fang Prison.</p><p></p><p>But what was going on?</p><p></p><p>Why were Zhang Han and the others so certain that Weizhang would come?</p><p></p><p>Was the plan of Flowing Sand exposed?!</p><p></p><p>But that shouldn't be!</p><p></p><p>She hadn't said a word, and Zhang Han and the others also didn't know that Flowing Sand had cooperated with Luowang.</p><p></p><p>It was even more impossible for them to know about Flowing Sand's subsequent plans.</p><p></p><p>Could it be Luowang?</p><p></p><p>Did Luowang betray them and leak Flowing Sand's plan?!</p><p></p><p>But what benefit would that bring them?</p><p></p><p>Mo Yuqilin suddenly thought of a terrifying possibility.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps Luowang had never intended to seek cooperation with Flowing Sand in the first place, but was setting a trap for them.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could she have exposed her identity so easily?</p><p></p><p>And she herself at...</p><p></p><p>(The excerpt ends here)</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Without saying a word, how could Ying Zheng have thought of arranging people here in advance, waiting for Lord Wei Zhuang to walk into the trap?</p><p></p><p>Everything was a conspiracy plotted by Luo Wang and Ying Zheng!</p><p></p><p>It was a trap they set together to try to conquer Liusha!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this possibility, Mo Yu Qilin was secretly filled with hate, almost grinding his teeth to pieces!</p><p></p><p>He hated both the Qin's treacherous schemes and Luo Wang's glib tongue that deceived them into trusting him.</p><p></p><p>If Luo Wang's people knew what Mo Yu Qilin was thinking, they would probably cry out for being wronged.</p><p></p><p>Things having come to this, Mo Yu Qilin could only pray that Wei Zhuang and the others would not come, at least not before Zhang Han and his men withdrew their ambush.</p><p></p><p>On the other side at the entrance of the Shi Ya Prison, Wei Zhuang could not hear Mo Yu Qilin's prayer and was waiting for the tide to recede.</p><p></p><p>To enter Shi Ya Prison, this was the only way.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Wei Zhuang seized the opportunity of the ebbing tide and infiltrated into Shi Ya Prison.</p><p></p><p>The guard at the entrance was knocked out by him with one blow.</p><p></p><p>In order not to attract attention, he did not dare to strike heavily, lest the smell of blood spread out and draw the attention of others.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang continued to penetrate into the interior of Shi Ya Prison.</p><p></p><p>What made him feel a little strange was that this process seemed simpler than imagined.</p><p></p><p>It could be said to be incredibly smooth.</p><p></p><p>Did he overthink things?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps Shi Ya Prison was not as terrible as the intelligence indicated.</p><p></p><p>Finally, according to the intelligence given by Yan Ri, Wei Zhuang successfully entered the depths of Shi Ya Prison.</p><p></p><p>If the intelligence was correct, ahead was the area where felons were imprisoned.</p><p></p><p>Gai Nie and Lin Er were most likely inside.</p><p></p><p>As long as he rescued them and left here next, this operation would be considered complete.</p><p></p><p>However, when Wei Zhuang entered the gate to the depths, the scene before his eyes completely stunned him.</p><p></p><p>What appeared in front of him were not the guards he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was Zhang Han and the Yin-Yang family experts and others in battle formation.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the suddenly appearing Wei Zhuang, they were obviously also startled.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang actually came as the emperor said!</p><p></p><p>And he came alone, single-handedly!</p><p></p><p>His Majesty actually predicted it as accurately as when he ambushed Gai Nie last time!</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han and the few Yin-Yang family members looked at each other and saw the same disbelief in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Xing Hun couldn't help but say, "You really came?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wei Zhuang was shocked.</p><p></p><p>What did that mean?</p><p></p><p>It sounded as if they had anticipated his actions long ago.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that they knew he would come?</p><p></p><p>And then they were waiting here for him on purpose?</p><p></p><p>Impossible!</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thanks to all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>Three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>

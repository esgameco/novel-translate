        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Regarding the deal proposed by Yan Ri, Wei Zhuang thought for a moment and finally agreed.</p><p></p><p>In order to ensure the completion of the task, he dispatched the most mysterious and terrifying assassin in the Flowing Sand organization, Mo Yu Qilin.</p><p></p><p>Mo Yu Qilin's disguise technique could transform into all living beings, changing his appearance, voice, movements, etc. His searching ability was the strongest in Flowing Sand.</p><p></p><p>The cooperation between Flowing Sand and Luo Wang was thus reached.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, what they didn't know was what kind of opponent they were facing.</p><p></p><p>In the Shu Fei Palace, Ying Chen was practicing.</p><p></p><p>He felt the surging imperial energy in his body and was a little puzzled. </p><p></p><p>What exactly was the situation recently?</p><p></p><p>He didn't do anything himself, so how could this imperial energy surge wave after wave?</p><p></p><p>Even if he didn't take the initiative to practice, the imperial energy still rushed into his body!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that something Brother Zheng did over there could also be counted on him?</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen couldn't figure it out.</p><p></p><p>After a few seconds of entanglement, he decided not to think about it if he couldn't figure it out.</p><p></p><p>No matter what happened, it was a good thing for him.</p><p></p><p>Just absorb it and be done with it!</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen began to operate the Huang Ji Dadao Jing.</p><p></p><p>Countless imperial energy poured into his body.</p><p></p><p>The surging imperial energy gave him the capital to improve his realm.</p><p></p><p>Imperial Energy Realm level five.</p><p></p><p>Imperial Energy Realm level six.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until the Imperial Energy Realm level seven that the speed of realm advancement gradually slowed down.</p><p></p><p>The Huang Ji Dadao Realm had a small realm for every three levels. He, who had reached the seventh level, could be considered to have entered the later stage of the Imperial Energy Realm.</p><p></p><p>After the advancement of his realm, he also gained an additional ability.</p><p></p><p>Voice Transmission.</p><p></p><p>However, his Voice Transmission was not the ordinary kind, but a skill that could kill people.</p><p></p><p>The sound waves transmitted out would have vibrations, and those vibrations could affect the opponent's body, causing damage to the organs inside the opponent's body.</p><p></p><p>It could invisibly take people's lives.</p><p></p><p>It could be regarded as the sound wave technique version of Voice Transmission.</p><p></p><p>Just as Ying Chen was carefully experiencing the changes in his body after the advancement of his realm.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng brought people over again.</p><p></p><p>However, this time, there was no carriage loaded with memorials behind him, only a few eunuchs holding a few boxes following behind him.</p><p></p><p>Shu Fei saw Ying Zheng coming and immediately stepped forward to greet him.</p><p></p><p>Although His Majesty had been coming here to work these past few days, and she had gotten used to it.</p><p></p><p>But etiquette cannot be abandoned, and one cannot slack off just because one is used to it.</p><p></p><p>However, today's His Majesty was still a little different.</p><p></p><p>After Shu Fei stepped forward to pay her respects, she asked suspiciously, "Why didn't Your Majesty bring memorials today? Could it be that Your Majesty doesn't need to review memorials today?"</p><p></p><p>Shu Fei subconsciously equated bamboo slips with memorials.</p><p></p><p>Seeing no bamboo slips, she thought there were no memorials.</p><p></p><p>So she thought that this time His Majesty came here to rest and relax.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng smiled.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng did not speak, but instead had the eunuch open the box. </p><p></p><p>Inside were the memorials, printed on paper.</p><p></p><p>They were stacked neatly together in piles, looking orderly and pleasing to the eye.</p><p></p><p>Having been in the palace for a long time, Shu Fei had never seen paper before. </p><p></p><p>Seeing this, she subconsciously paused in surprise and exclaimed, "Your Majesty, what is this?"</p><p></p><p>The surface appeared to be linen, but looked lighter and thinner than linen.</p><p></p><p>There were even words written on it.</p><p></p><p>Shu Fei looked left and right, finding it more and more novel the more she looked.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng glanced at Shu Fei's slightly bulging abdomen and said casually, "This is called paper. It's what I mentioned to you before - something lighter and more convenient than bamboo slips."</p><p></p><p>Shu Fei gaped, "This is paper?!" </p><p></p><p>She thought His Majesty was just speaking offhandedly and didn't expect there to really be such a wonderful thing in the world!</p><p></p><p>For a moment, her eyes were glued to the stacks of paper, full of curiosity. </p><p></p><p>Could such a convenient item really replace the role of bamboo slips?</p><p></p><p>Shu Fei was extremely curious and wanted to touch the paper inside, but didn't dare to.</p><p></p><p>She was afraid of damaging that precious paper.</p><p></p><p>And Ying Chen in her belly, upon seeing the paper with his spiritual sense, was stunned for a moment and couldn't help his thoughts from wandering.</p><p></p><p>[What's going on? Did Zheng-ge make paper himself?] </p><p></p><p>[But no, even if Zheng-ge made this thing himself, there's a high chance he would change the name and not call it paper.]</p><p></p><p>[Could there be a time traveler?]</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng heard the surprise in Ying Chen's voice. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly, revealing a barely perceptible smile. </p><p></p><p>Deep in his heart, a corner felt extremely pleased!</p><p></p><p>This kid usually acts like he knows everything.</p><p></p><p>This time there's finally something unexpected for him too, right? </p><p></p><p>Surprised? Confused? Didn't expect it?</p><p></p><p>Finally! This kid can also experience his previous feelings.</p><p></p><p>That feeling of not knowing what happened, only able to doubt your own ears, and then doubt your own sanity.</p><p></p><p>That shock and bewilderment...</p><p></p><p>This is the first time he's made this kid experience such emotions too!</p><p></p><p>In any case, his current mood can be summed up in one word.</p><p></p><p>Awesome!</p><p></p><p>So awesome!</p><p></p><p>No matter who expresses shock and admiration for paper, none give him a higher sense of accomplishment than what he feels at this moment!</p><p></p><p>Coming here specially this time was not in vain.</p><p></p><p>Worth it!</p><p></p><p>However, what is a "time traveler"? </p><p></p><p>Is it also some new faction?</p><p></p><p>Could it also be an anti-Qin force?</p><p></p><p>Before Ying Zheng could figure out this question, an excited eunuch came in to report.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to Your Majesty! Felicitations to Your Majesty! The Yunzhong Lord's life-extending elixir has been successfully concocted!"</p>

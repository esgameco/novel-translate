        <h1>Chapter 54</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Five or six days had passed since the First Emperor's visit that day. During this period, His Majesty had also come, but he seemed to be busy dealing with some tricky political affairs. Concubine Shu felt very distressed seeing this. Every time after he finished his political affairs, Concubine Shu would massage His Majesty's shoulders and forehead to relieve his fatigue. This made Ying Zheng praise Concubine Shu's thoughtfulness from time to time.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Ying Chen was practicing cultivation again. Suddenly, he discovered that the Imperial Qi inside his body showed signs of surging once more. Ying Chen had become accustomed to this situation. He decisively absorbed the Imperial Qi, preparing for a breakthrough. Quite some time had passed since the last breakthrough, and he had made considerable progress. This time, he would definitely achieve a breakthrough!</p><p></p><p>As expected, under Ying Chen's cultivation, he successfully broke through to the Imperial Qi Foundation Establishment stage! As soon as he reached the Foundation Establishment stage, Ying Chen immediately felt that his body was different. His body became more unrestrained, and his soul more ethereal. There were even signs of his soul leaving his body! This situation did not frighten Ying Chen; instead, it made him eager to start experimenting.</p><p></p><p>He tried to control his soul to leave his body. Under his bold attempt, he actually allowed his soul to leave his body and roam freely in the outside world! Finally, Ying Chen understood that this was a new ability he gained after the breakthrough - Divine Soul Separation. Divine Soul Separation, as the name suggests, allows one's divine soul to leave the body for a period of time. The divine soul is not limited by the body and can gallop in the outside world according to one's will. However, the divine soul is far less solid than the Nascent Soul and cannot be exposed to the outside world for long. Even so, Ying Chen was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>In this way, he could also play a role at critical moments. More importantly, he also gained the ability to reshape his body with Imperial Qi! By then, he could quickly escape the form of a baby and grow into an adult. He hoped that when the time came, he would not frighten Zheng Ge because of his overly rapid growth.</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon, Ying Zheng arrived, looking to be in a good mood. Just now, Gong Shu Chou had shown him the newly built fishing boats and large fishing nets. The combination of these two had an amazing ability to catch fish. It could be said that with one net cast, there would be no fish that could escape, and it would be filled to the brim. Just looking at it made one very happy.</p><p></p><p>In addition, with the saltpeter ice-making, the people sent had already produced a lot of ice. The ice had all been preserved and could be put to great use during transportation later. There were still large supplies of saltpeter, enough to make a large amount of ice. Now some of the fishing boats had already set out to fish in the coastal areas. After being caught, the fish and shrimp would be directly sent to the inland areas lacking food after processing. It could be said that the problem of food shortage for the people would be solved in no time. And...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>And according to that brat, as long as they find high-yielding grain, they won't have to worry too much about the food problem in the future.</p><p></p><p>His Qin Dynasty will become one where everyone can eat their fill and have surplus grain!</p><p></p><p>This put Ying Zheng in a great mood.</p><p></p><p>His steps were light and brisk, almost unable to suppress the upward curl of his lips.</p><p></p><p>Shu Fei was most adept at reading people's expressions and immediately noticed the Emperor's good mood.</p><p></p><p>She asked with a smile, "What happened? What has made Your Majesty so happy?"</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng's steps paused slightly, glancing at Shu Fei's abdomen, the smile on his face receding a little.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, just matters of the court, you don't need to concern yourself with it."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor was unwilling to say, so Shu Fei naturally wouldn't force him.</p><p></p><p>Besides, she didn't understand court affairs, and even if His Majesty told her, she probably wouldn't grasp the significance.</p><p></p><p>Thinking that his son deserved credit for all this, Ying Zheng couldn't help but want to compensate him.</p><p></p><p>So, he changed the subject, "I've been running to your place every day recently, you've worked hard."</p><p></p><p>Shu Fei quickly said, "I haven't worked hard, it is Your Majesty who has worked hard, I have only done what I should."</p><p></p><p>Shu Fei was so well-behaved and knew her place, instantly softening Ying Zheng's heart.</p><p></p><p>He immediately announced, "Someone, elevate Shu Fei's rank to Mei Ren (Beauty)!"</p><p></p><p>Shu Fei was suddenly conferred a title, and couldn't help feeling overwhelmed by the favor.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty is too good to me, I really don't know how to repay Your Majesty's generous treatment."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Shu Fei's sincere gratitude, Ying Zheng felt his conferment was justified.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng exhorted, "You don't need to repay me, just be sure to protect the child well."</p><p></p><p>This child is the future hope of the Great Qin!</p><p></p><p>Shu Fei didn't know what Ying Zheng was thinking, assuming that His Majesty's love for her extended to her child, placing expectations on him.</p><p></p><p>She was even more moved in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng still had government affairs to handle, so he prepared to leave after the conferment.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen was speechless.</p><p></p><p>[What's going on? Mother's rank has been promoted to Mei Ren just like that? When did Zheng Ge become so agreeable?]</p><p></p><p>Hearing the inner voice, Ying Zheng silently retorted.</p><p></p><p>This brat, he doesn't know what's good for him!</p><p></p><p>Isn't it all for you!</p><p></p><p>If Shu Fei lives well and has a place in the rear palace, only then can this brat have a good life in the future!</p><p></p><p>He won't be bullied because of his mother's low status.</p><p></p><p>But he could only think this in his heart, unable to say it out loud.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he could only leave in a huff.</p><p></p><p>Although Ying Chen was puzzled, it was ultimately a good thing, so he didn't think too much about it. That time was better spent on improving his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen continued to cultivate, stabilizing his Imperial Qi Foundation Establishment Realm and strengthening his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thanks to all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>Three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 45</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Among the Six Sword Slaves, Duan Shui, watching Yan Ri and Jing Ni gradually moving away, sensed that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>He frowned and said, "I have a feeling that the people from Liu Sha seem to be deliberately luring Lord Yan Ri and Jing Ni away."</p><p></p><p>After he said this, the others also noticed the abnormality.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, if Liu Sha really wanted to fight with Lord Yan Ri, this distance would have been enough for them to engage.</p><p></p><p>But why weren't they stopping?</p><p></p><p>Their shadows were almost out of sight.</p><p></p><p>This was clearly an attempt to lure them far away.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Duan Shui felt uneasy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhen Gang said nonchalantly, "Even if they deliberately lure them away, so what? How can a few people from Liu Sha be a match for Lord Yan Ri and Jing Ni?"</p><p></p><p>The other Six Sword Slaves nodded, fully agreeing.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, in their hearts, Yan Ri and Jing Ni's strength was beyond doubt.</p><p></p><p>They themselves represented victory and had no possibility of defeat.</p><p></p><p>With this said, Duan Shui's heart eased a little.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, what in the world could be more reassuring than Lord Yan Ri's strength?</p><p></p><p>Now, Liu Sha no longer had Wei Zhuang at the helm and was just a group of rabble.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention one, even if ten such Liu Shas came, they would be no match for Lord Yan Ri.</p><p></p><p>Plus, with Jing Ni by his side, there was even less to worry about.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were letting their guard down, several figures suddenly appeared!</p><p></p><p>They were the Mo Jia leaders - Mo Jia Ju Zi, Xue NÃ¼, Gao Jian Li, Da Tie Chui, and others!</p><p></p><p>They were each holding weapons and coming towards them aggressively!</p><p></p><p>Oh no, the target of this group was clearly them!</p><p></p><p>The Six Sword Slaves' faces changed, and they immediately realized the situation was not good.</p><p></p><p>How could Mo Jia suddenly appear here?</p><p></p><p>And the timing was just right!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Liu Sha and Mo Jia had joined hands?!</p><p></p><p>Didn't they have a grudge between them? How could they join hands?!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Duan Shui, who thought of this layer, connected it with Liu Sha's actions just now and understood everything.</p><p></p><p>Liu Sha just now had deliberately lured away Lord Yan Ri and Jing Ni, just to let the people of Mo Jia attack them at this moment!</p><p></p><p>Their real target was them! It was Shi Ya Yu!</p><p></p><p>The Six Sword Slaves thought it was not good, Lord Yan Ri and Jing Ni had perfectly fallen into the trap.</p><p></p><p>They must immediately send this message out!</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Yan Ri or the inside of Shi Ya Yu, they all needed to know this news!</p><p></p><p>However, by the time they realized it, it was too late.</p><p></p><p>With Mo Jia's large numbers, how could they allow the Six Sword Slaves to escape easily?</p><p></p><p>They cooperated tacitly with each other and directly launched an attack on the Six Sword Slaves, engaging them.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The movements of the Six Sword Slaves were restrained.</p><p></p><p>Not allowing any of them the opportunity to report back.</p><p></p><p>The Six Sword Slaves were too busy dealing with the attacks to do anything else besides defend themselves.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the chaos, Zhang Liang, Bai Feng, and Dao Zhi successfully entered the Devouring Fang Prison.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Devouring Fang Prison, they were still unaware of the three uninvited guests.</p><p></p><p>The prison guards patrolled everywhere, checking for any abnormalities within the prison.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang glanced at the prison guards and said to the other two, "Time is limited. Our goal is to save people, so don't get entangled with them."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, attracting others will only be a burden for us."</p><p></p><p>Bai Feng and Dao Zhi nodded, understanding Zhang Liang's meaning.</p><p></p><p>The two gathered their qi, used their lightness skills, and directly leaped over the heads of the prison guards, rushing inside.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang followed closely behind, his speed not slower than the other two in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Bai Feng and Dao Zhi had originally been worried that Zhang Liang wouldn't be able to keep up with their speed, but it turned out they were overthinking.</p><p></p><p>Dao Zhi exclaimed with great joy, "I didn't expect Master Zhang Liang's lightness skills to be so amazing as well."</p><p></p><p>Bai Feng also nodded slightly, expressing his affirmation of Zhang Liang.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang humbly said, "You two praise me too much. Compared to you both, I'm still somewhat lacking."</p><p></p><p>The three used their lightness skills and quickly hurried, advancing into the depths of the Devouring Fang Prison.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a change suddenly occurred in the Devouring Fang Prison!</p><p></p><p>The path and terrain ahead were rapidly changing!</p><p></p><p>In no time, it had become completely different from the previous path!</p><p></p><p>Bai Feng was greatly alarmed!</p><p></p><p>His lightness skill faltered for a moment and he nearly fell!</p><p></p><p>It was also Dao Zhi's first time seeing a path change like this. He was startled for a moment, not knowing which way he should go.</p><p></p><p>Because the path changed so quickly, the direction they had originally come from and the direction they were originally headed had completely changed.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the few of them couldn't tell which direction was which.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang steadied his mind and while working hard to discern their current direction, he also comforted the other two.</p><p></p><p>"You two, don't panic. The Devouring Fang Prison itself is a large mechanism. This is the Devouring Fang Prison's strange transformation. I will make calculations."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Zhang Liang calculated the strange transformation and instructed them on the direction they should head.</p><p></p><p>"Young Hero Dao Zhi, remember the current changes well. From now on, I will lead the way. You two must follow closely behind me."</p><p></p><p>Dao Zhi nodded, "No problem, rest assured, I will firmly remember these changes."</p><p></p><p>Bai Feng had no objections and followed behind Zhang Liang.</p><p></p><p>The three continued to infiltrate deeper into the Devouring Fang Prison.</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, and thanking all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>The three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>

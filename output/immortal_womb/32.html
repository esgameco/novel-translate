            <p>Sure, here's the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Ying Chen did not disappoint him and subconsciously began to ponder this question.</p><p></p><p>[Wang Li definitely won't do. He's too young and too arrogant. Meng Tian should have no problem fighting the Northern Barbarians, but if he encounters that Greek + Roman + Macedonian variant phalanx unexpectedly, he's still likely to suffer a loss.]</p><p></p><p>[Meng Tian too, he's leading the golden fire cavalry but not bringing bows and crossbows, and directly impacting the Macedonian phalanx head-on. Isn't this clearly a losing proposition?]</p><p></p><p>[If you ask me, just use rocket fire to blanket them. Who cares about Macedonian phalanx or Maxidonian phalanx, burn them all down with one fire! At worst, you have to leverage the mobility of the cavalry to nibble away at the opponent bit by bit.]</p><p></p><p>The Macedonian phalanx is an infantry formation used in combat, where the soldiers form a very long horizontal line. The front-line soldiers point their spears forward, while the postures of the soldiers in the rear rows holding their spears vary, some tilted, some perpendicular to the ground.</p><p></p><p>In this way, they form a wall made of spears.</p><p></p><p>In combat, the entire phalanx often advances forward at a running pace in a solid, dense formation, like a battering ram fiercely impacting the enemy's ranks.</p><p></p><p>Any soldiers caught inside the phalanx will be slaughtered by the spear-wielding or sword-wielding soldiers.</p><p></p><p>And this phalanx must be coordinated with cavalry, which surrounds the enemy from a certain side as needed.</p><p></p><p>Or they charge and kill those enemies dodging the spearheads.</p><p></p><p>Those who cannot withstand the cavalry charge will be rolled into the phalanx, and even soldiers who escape the phalanx's pursuit cannot escape the cavalry's chase.</p><p></p><p>The coordination of infantry and cavalry is invincible.</p><p></p><p>It's a combination of mobility and lethality.</p><p></p><p>However, the formidable Macedonian phalanx has a fatal weakness, which is its flanks or rear.</p><p></p><p>As long as the flanks are breached, the pikemen in the spear formation have difficulty resisting the attack of swordsmen.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Macedonian phalanx is weak against dense arrow formations. Whether it's horse archers or foot archer units, as long as the light infantry can be dispersed, the arrayed pikemen are almost helpless against the shooting.</p><p></p><p>That's why Ying Chen proposed using rocket attacks, or leveraging their own cavalry advantage to go around the rear and nibble at the opposing side.</p><p></p><p>One could say that each point hits the vital weakness.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng listened to the preceding words and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>It seems his decision to choose Meng Tian was correct.</p><p></p><p>But hearing the latter part, Ying Zheng frowned.</p><p></p><p>What does it mean?</p><p></p><p>What Greek? What Macedonian?</p><p></p><p>What are these?</p><p></p><p>Does it mean Meng Tian will encounter unexpected enemies on this northern campaign?</p><p></p><p>Although a few words sounded foggy, it didn't affect his understanding of the given countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>It seems he'll have to give Meng Tian some reminders when he returns.</p><p></p><p>Let Meng Tian use rockets and fully</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of the cavalry's mobility...</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng pondered the words he heard, silently summarizing in his heart. </p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhang Han arrived and reported to Ying Zheng: "Your Majesty, Mo Yu Qilin has been imprisoned in Shi Ya Prison."</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng nodded, this was something he had instructed Zhang Han to do earlier.</p><p></p><p>He pricked up his ears again, wanting to hear what this son's views were on the matter of Mo Yu Qilin. </p><p></p><p>Hearing Zhang Han's words, Ying Chen subconsciously thought:</p><p></p><p>[Mo Yu Qilin is also locked up in Shi Ya Prison? Together with Gai Nie, it looks very likely that Wei Zhuang and his subordinate Liu Sha will make a move on Shi Ya Prison.]</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng heard these inner thoughts and nodded to himself. </p><p></p><p>He was aware of the deep bond between Gai Nie and Wei Zhuang. Although these sworn brothers appeared to be at odds, in fact they both cared for each other.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Wei Zhuang would definitely not stand by idly and was certain to come to Shi Ya Prison.</p><p></p><p>This was a great opportunity to capture Wei Zhuang and Liu Sha!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Ying Zheng ordered Zhang Han: "Change the defenses of Shi Ya Prison, loose on the outside and tight on the inside, and wait for the fish to take the bait."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han was a bit incredulous upon hearing the order: "Your Majesty means that someone will come to break them out of prison?"</p><p></p><p>But that's Shi Ya Prison!</p><p></p><p>Just the internal changes alone have tens of thousands of variations! Even with the internal blueprints, one may not necessarily be able to deduce the correct path.</p><p></p><p>How could anyone possibly conceive of a jailbreak?</p><p></p><p>Isn't that just seeking death?</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han knew that His Majesty disliked others questioning him, so he silently swallowed those thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng was unwaveringly confident that Wei Zhuang would lead Liu Sha to attack Shi Ya Prison in the future. </p><p></p><p>He believed in his own judgment, and even more so in the judgment of this son of his.</p><p></p><p>"Better safe than sorry. Go find the Yin-Yang Masters Yue Shen and Xing Hun, and have them lie in wait with you."</p><p></p><p>"With the experts of the Yin-Yang School together, we must ensure foolproof security."</p><p></p><p>In fact, the complexity of Shi Ya Prison itself made their jailbreak exceedingly difficult.</p><p></p><p>The entrance to Shi Ya Prison was extremely hidden, concealed beneath the seawater, only to be revealed after the tide receded. </p><p></p><p>Just getting in was a huge problem.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention having to find an escape route amidst the tens of thousands of changes.</p><p></p><p>It was almost an impossible task.</p><p></p><p>On top of that, Ying Zheng also dispatched the Shadow Guards and Yin-Yang Masters.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that this time, there was no escape for Liu Sha.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han accepted the order and left to make preparations.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ying Chen sighed in his heart:</p><p></p><p>[It looks like Brother Zheng and I are thinking along the same lines. Not only making arrangements in advance, but also sending out the Yin-Yang School experts. Wei Zhuang is in for some bad luck.]</p>

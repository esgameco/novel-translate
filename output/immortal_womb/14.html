        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the residence of the eldest prince of the Great Qin.</p><p></p><p>Fusu was discussing classics and strategies with a group of Confucian scholars.</p><p></p><p>This was a necessary daily activity for them.</p><p></p><p>If the policies were truly beneficial to the country, it would be fine, but unfortunately, most of them were just empty talk, merely adding a few changes to the words of the ancients.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a Confucian scholar ran in excitedly with a piece of paper, shouting, "Everyone, look at this! What is it?"</p><p></p><p>Fusu took the paper and looked at it, his eyes lighting up, "What is this thing? How can it be so light and thin?"</p><p></p><p>He touched the rough surface and suddenly had an epiphany, saying, "I wonder if this thing can be used for writing. If it can be used for writing, wouldn't it be very convenient?"</p><p></p><p>The Confucian scholar flattered, "As expected of Your Highness, the eldest prince, you immediately saw the use of this thing."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, this thing is called paper and is used for writing."</p><p></p><p>When the Confucian scholars heard that this thing could be used for writing, they immediately gathered around.</p><p></p><p>"Can such a light and thin thing be used for writing? Won't it break?"</p><p></p><p>"What's more worrying is, won't the ink smudge and spread on it?"</p><p></p><p>The Confucian scholars did not believe that this thing could actually be used for writing.</p><p></p><p>It looked so fragile and easily damaged!</p><p></p><p>Seeing their doubts, the Confucian scholar holding the paper immediately took out a brush and wrote a character on it.</p><p></p><p>With one stroke, it clearly showed up on the paper!</p><p></p><p>Neither did the ink leak, nor did it smudge into a mess!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Confucian scholars widened their eyes, and the crowd erupted.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible? It can really be used for writing?!"</p><p></p><p>"How can it be so amazing? Is this paper?!"</p><p></p><p>"Where did it come from? Is it very expensive?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Confucian scholars crowded together, and the discussion was endless.</p><p></p><p>Among them, a few intelligent Confucian scholars had already realized the importance of paper.</p><p></p><p>With this thing called paper, they would no longer need those heavy bamboo slips!</p><p></p><p>They could more easily record their Confucian thoughts and copy their books to spread them!</p><p></p><p>Not only that, in this world where the literacy rate was low.</p><p></p><p>The emergence of paper would definitely allow more people to read and write, and in the future, more knowledgeable people would join their ranks!</p><p></p><p>So, the Confucian scholar who thought of this asked eagerly, "Where exactly did this come from? Did you make it yourself? This is a great invention!"</p><p></p><p>The Confucian scholar made a gesture of respect and said, "I don't have this ability. This was made by General Meng Tian on the orders of His Majesty, but it is said that it was not invented by His Majesty."</p><p></p><p>The Confucian scholars were puzzled. If it was not invented by His Majesty, then who invented it?</p><p></p><p>This matter was an unsolvable mystery.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even if they racked their brains, they would not be able to find the answer.</p><p></p><p>So they quickly put it out of their minds. </p><p></p><p>The top priority was to pass this thing on to their sect.</p><p></p><p>A Confucian scholar said: "Quick! Send a letter about this matter to the Little Sage Village! The three masters will surely be very happy if they know of the existence of this thing!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone came to their senses and sent out letters one after another.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in another place, paper was not taken so seriously.</p><p></p><p>In the residence of the Eighteen Princes of Qin.</p><p></p><p>Hu Hai took the paper handed over by Zhao Gao and crumpled it in his hands a few times, not thinking much of it.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of paper is this, isn't it just for writing things on? Is it really that important?"</p><p></p><p>He grew up privileged since childhood and did not feel that this was anything precious at all, nor did he understand the important meaning behind paper.</p><p></p><p>But Zhao Gao was different from Hu Hai. He fully understood how great a change the appearance of paper would bring.</p><p></p><p>But at the moment, thinking of another matter, his face was so gloomy that it almost seemed to be dripping water. </p><p></p><p>Rather than the appearance of paper, what he was more concerned about was not the paper itself, but the person who invented the paper.</p><p></p><p>The Luo Web, which was said to monitor the world, knew nothing about the origin of this thing!</p><p></p><p>It appeared out of nowhere and spread among the people out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>The Luo Web was like a blind man, and only when this thing appeared did it realize what had happened!</p><p></p><p>How could he tolerate such a thing?!</p><p></p><p>Hu Hai folded the paper in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that this thing was made by Meng Tian on Father Emperor's orders, could it be a method that Father Emperor came up with?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao shook his head, he understood the Emperor's personality, if it was a method that the Emperor himself had come up with, he would definitely not deny it.</p><p></p><p>Since he clearly said it was not, then it must not be.</p><p></p><p>This could only mean that behind the Emperor, there must be a sage!</p><p></p><p>It was this sage who had caused so many things behind the scenes, both the time with Gai Nie and this time.</p><p></p><p>Yet in these two incidents, he could not find any trace of him at all!</p><p></p><p>Even when he sent out Jing Ni to investigate the rear palace last time, not only did he not gain anything, he almost exposed himself!</p><p></p><p>This cannot go on!</p><p></p><p>If he continued to be passive like this, if that sage found out about his existence, he would definitely have the Emperor eliminate him!</p><p></p><p>Just like Gai Nie.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao paced and pondered, and finally, he decided to summon Yan Ri.</p><p></p><p>Let Yan Ri go to the Flowing Sand Valley and tell Flowing Sand the news of Gai Nie's capture.</p><p></p><p>When Flowing Sand heard this news, he would definitely not sit idly by.</p><p></p><p>Then he would take the opportunity to ask Flowing Sand to lend a hand and find out clues about this mysterious person.</p><p></p><p>PS: 10 updates every day, this old author is begging for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, and rewards.

        <div class="content">
            <p>In Meng Tian's residence.</p><p></p><p>Meng Tian was preparing for the expedition to the north.</p><p></p><p>The emperor attached great importance to this war, and so did he.</p><p></p><p>The northern barbarians had big plans for this northward invasion.</p><p></p><p>He must lead the army to stop the northern barbarians and let them know that the borders of the Great Qin are not where they should come!</p><p></p><p>The soldiers of the Great Qin are not to be trifled with!</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Meng Tian personally took care of every detail to ensure there were no mistakes.</p><p></p><p>As Meng Tian was packing up the border defense maps and some materials, the housekeeper hurried in.</p><p></p><p>He reported to Meng Tian, "General, the emperor has sent a letter."</p><p></p><p>With that said, the housekeeper handed the letter to Meng Tian.</p><p></p><p>Taking the letter, it indeed had the emperor's seal on it.</p><p></p><p>Meng Tian was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when he discussed the war against the northern barbarians with the emperor, the emperor had already given all the necessary instructions.</p><p></p><p>Why did the emperor send another letter now?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the emperor had some new ideas?</p><p></p><p>Meng Tian opened the letter and read the contents carefully.</p><p></p><p>However, after reading it twice, Meng Tian became even more puzzled.</p><p></p><p>In the letter, the emperor reminded him to be careful on this northward expedition.</p><p></p><p>He must always carry things like bows, arrows, and oil.</p><p></p><p>And if he encounters mysterious enemies, he should not act rashly, let alone charge head-on.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he should make full use of the cavalry's mobility to gradually wear down the enemy...</p><p></p><p>These very specific suggestions left Meng Tian somewhat at a loss.</p><p></p><p>What did the emperor mean by this?</p><p></p><p>He hadn't even gone north yet and didn't know the enemy's situation.</p><p></p><p>How could the emperor seem to know what kind of enemy he would encounter?</p><p></p><p>It was as if the emperor even knew what tactics the enemy would employ.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the emperor had planted spies among the northern barbarians?</p><p></p><p>Or did he have informants reporting to him?</p><p></p><p>Why had the emperor never mentioned this before?</p><p></p><p>No matter how much Meng Tian thought about it, he couldn't understand what was going on.</p><p></p><p>However, Meng Tian's advantage was that he was loyal and obedient enough.</p><p></p><p>Even if he had many questions in his mind, he would still do as the emperor instructed.</p><p></p><p>He would not be obstinate or act on his own.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng knew this very well, which was why he wrote the letter to specifically instruct him.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Meng Tian kept these instructions firmly in mind.</p><p></p><p>He planned to use these methods to deal with the situations the emperor mentioned if he encountered them on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, outside the Shi Ya Prison, the members of the Flowing Sand group had already gathered.</p><p></p><p>This time they were going to break into the famous Shi Ya Prison, so they dared not take it lightly. Basically, everyone who could come had come.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang looked at the intelligence about Shi Ya Prison obtained from Yan Ri, frowning.</p><p></p><p>It was no other reason than that Shi Ya Prison was too difficult to break into.</p><p></p><p>The entrance was hidden beneath the seawater and could only be discovered during low tide. When the tide rose, people inside would not be able to come out.</p><p></p><p>The Devouring Fang Prison itself was a huge mechanical fortress, with all parts capable of moving.</p><p></p><p>The techniques of Qimen (mysterious gate) were ever-changing. The Qimen changes adopted by the Devouring Fang Prison were divided into two types: the Pai Gong method and the Fei Gong method.</p><p></p><p>The Pai Gong method had 262,144 variations, while the Fei Gong method had 531,441 variations.</p><p></p><p>The combinations of the two resulted in even more variations, a staggering number that could not be solved by human power alone.</p><p></p><p>Without mastering the Qimen calculation method, sending in more people would only mean sending them to their deaths.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Ying Zheng chose this place as a prison.</p><p></p><p>If one were to name the most impregnable places in the world, the Devouring Fang Prison would definitely be on the list.</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian had no idea what difficulties they would encounter. She asked, "Zhuang, when do we take action?"</p><p></p><p>After careful consideration, Wei Zhuang said to everyone, "For this operation, I will go in alone, and you will provide support from the outside."</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian, Bai Feng, Wu Shuang Gui, Cang Lang Wang, Yin Fu, and others suddenly raised their heads to look at Wei Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>"You're going in alone?!"</p><p></p><p>"How can that be?!"</p><p></p><p>"It's too dangerous! We can't let you take the risk alone!"</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian disagreed even more, "No, it's too risky for you to go alone. Take me with you, we'll go together and can look out for each other."</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang shook his head and explained to everyone, "The terror of the Devouring Fang Prison is not as simple as you imagine. The Qimen techniques inside are ever-changing, and having more people doesn't mean an advantage."</p><p></p><p>"The hundreds of thousands of variations inside require initial layout and calculation of patterns to solve."</p><p></p><p>"You don't understand the Qimen variations, so going in will only be a hindrance."</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian was a bit unconvinced.</p><p></p><p>Even if they didn't understand those Qimen calculations, having more people would always provide some support and wouldn't be a bad thing, so how could it be a hindrance?</p><p></p><p>But she didn't know how to persuade Wei Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>Once Wei Zhuang made a decision, no one could change his mind.</p><p></p><p>Bai Feng didn't care about Wei Zhuang's arrangement.</p><p></p><p>Not going in was just as well, as her pet White Phoenix wouldn't be able to fully utilize its abilities in the enclosed space of the Devouring Fang Prison.</p><p></p><p>If it went in, it would only cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the others weren't saying anything and seemed to have accepted Wei Zhuang's arrangement, Chi Lian couldn't help but feel anxious.</p><p></p><p>She still wanted to say something and grabbed Wei Zhuang's sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang brushed off her hand, his voice filled with unprecedented determination, "This is an order."</p><p></p><p>With that, he turned and left alone.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, his presence disappeared.</p><p></p><p>PS: Please give flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, and rewards.

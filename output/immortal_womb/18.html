            <p>After the Lord of the Clouds left, Ying Zheng immediately summoned the royal physician to examine the elixir he had just received.</p><p></p><p>Having received the emperor's order, the royal physician dared not show the slightest carelessness and began to inspect the small pills.</p><p></p><p>After a careful examination, the royal physician cautiously asked, "May I ask Your Majesty, what kind of elixir is this?"</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng detected the hesitation in the royal physician's tone and asked, "What's the matter? Is there any problem with the elixir?"</p><p></p><p>The royal physician hesitated for a moment before answering, "The main ingredients of this elixir are all potent medicines that, although can be used to alleviate suffering and stimulate potential, will also drain one's life force."</p><p></p><p>"What's even more bizarre is that after being harmonized with some unknown ingredients, the medicinal properties have undergone another change."</p><p></p><p>"Please forgive this old man's incompetence, as I am unable to determine the specific effects of this elixir."</p><p></p><p>The royal physician spoke the truth without any concealment, revealing both the good and bad aspects of the elixir.</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, Ying Zheng's eyes turned cold for a moment.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand to dismiss the royal physician.</p><p></p><p>Beneath his calm expression, anger had already ignited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>How dare the Lord of the Clouds claim that a life-draining, potent medicine was a life-prolonging elixir?</p><p></p><p>What exactly were his intentions?</p><p></p><p>Was it truly for his own good?</p><p></p><p>Or was he trying to deceive him?</p><p></p><p>However, the royal physician did not dare to confirm the true effects of the elixir at present, which made Ying Zheng somewhat hesitant.</p><p></p><p>What if these potent medicines, when combined together, could actually have some life-prolonging effects?</p><p></p><p>But he could not risk his own life to find out.</p><p></p><p>If someone else were to test the medicine, their strong resistance would ensure that even if there were a small amount of toxic ingredients, they would be safe in the short term, and no effects would be visible.</p><p></p><p>And if people were to take it long-term, the Lord of the Clouds had not provided enough elixir for that.</p><p></p><p>This put Ying Zheng in a difficult position.</p><p></p><p>How could he quickly determine the medicinal properties of the elixir without harming human lives?</p><p></p><p>Hearing the royal physician's inability to determine the medicinal properties, Ying Chen couldn't help but think of a way to test them.</p><p></p><p>[If you want to know the effects of this elixir, it's simple. Insects and ants have small bodies and far less resistance than humans. Test it on insects and ants, and the effects will be immediately known.]</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng heard the inner voice once again and his eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Yes, how come he hadn't thought of this method?!</p><p></p><p>Using insects and ants would not harm human lives and could quickly yield the results he wanted.</p><p></p><p>No sooner said than done, Ying Zheng directly summoned the Shadow Guards.</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Han, go find some insects and ants to test the medicinal properties of the elixir."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han immediately followed the order and found a bunch of different kinds of insects and ants, placing them in jars.</p><p></p><p>The insects and ants in the jars were still unaware of what they were facing.</p><p></p><p>They were...</p><p></p><p>The ants crawled around in the bottle, searching for an exit.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng motioned for the eunuch to hand over the elixir that Yun Zhong Jun had just presented to Zhang Han.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han took the elixir, opened the bottle, took out a pill, crushed it, and fed it to the ants.</p><p></p><p>The ants didn't know what the thing that fell from the sky was.</p><p></p><p>They habitually assumed it was food.</p><p></p><p>After a round of sniffing, they began to eat the remnants of the elixir.</p><p></p><p>Other ants also started to scramble over, fighting to eat it.</p><p></p><p>Some of the ants that were left behind and couldn't get any were anxious.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the few ants that had eaten the elixir clearly became different.</p><p></p><p>Visibly, those ants became excited, much more energetic than before, and started crawling around.</p><p></p><p>Their crawling speed was much faster than before.</p><p></p><p>Some ants even became aggressive.</p><p></p><p>They directly bit to death any ants blocking their way.</p><p></p><p>They looked quite imposing.</p><p></p><p>However, the good times didn't last long.</p><p></p><p>The speed of those excitedly crawling ants gradually slowed down, and they gradually lost their vitality.</p><p></p><p>The noise they made became smaller and smaller.</p><p></p><p>Until finally, their bodies didn't move at all.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han took a few of them out and put them on the ground.</p><p></p><p>But those ants still didn't move, even when poked.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, they were dead.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the faces of everyone present changed!</p><p></p><p>The elixir presented by Yun Zhong Jun was not a longevity elixir at all, but a poisonous toxin!</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the emperor's wit in testing the medicine, the consequences of taking it long-term would likely be the same!</p><p></p><p>At that time, those who served the emperor would not have a good end either!</p><p></p><p>Everyone thought of this point and couldn't help but feel lingering fear.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng, who was originally going to take the elixir, had an ashen face.</p><p></p><p>A murderous intent surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zhong Jun! Another person who had betrayed his trust!</p><p></p><p>He let Yun Zhong Jun refine elixirs, no matter what rare materials he wanted, he found them one by one.</p><p></p><p>The rewards never stopped either.</p><p></p><p>But this guy wanted his life!</p><p></p><p>This was intolerable!</p><p></p><p>Yun Zhong Jun deserved to die!</p><p></p><p>Dying ten thousand times would not be enough!</p><p></p><p>And that Yin-Yang family, they were in the same group as Xu Fu, they all deserved to die!</p><p></p><p>Thinking like this, Ying Zheng's murderous aura had already spread to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen, who had been observing the whole process with his divine sense, naturally saw everything.</p><p></p><p>[It's over, the Yin-Yang family is going to suffer. It's a pity there are so many beauties in the Yin-Yang family, I was originally planning to take them.]</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thanks to all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>Three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>

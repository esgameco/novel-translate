        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>On the other side of the Flowing Sand Valley.</p><p></p><p>A figure clad in the imperial iron armor silently appeared.</p><p></p><p>It was Yan Ri from the Luo Wang who came to visit.</p><p></p><p>Although the people of the Flowing Sand Valley knew that Wei Zhuang and Luo Wang had reached a cooperation,</p><p></p><p>they still had their guard up against Yan Ri.</p><p></p><p>Only Wei Zhuang's expression remained unchanged, his sharp eyes staring at Yan Ri.</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri paid no attention to the gazes from the others.</p><p></p><p>He got straight to the point and said directly, "The Mo Yu Qilin you sent out has been captured."</p><p></p><p>This short sentence, like a bomb, shattered everyone's sanity into pieces!</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian widened her eyes in disbelief, "Lin'er has been captured? How is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>They all knew Mo Yu Qilin's abilities.</p><p></p><p>Her disguise technique had never failed before!</p><p></p><p>Whether it was her voice, the subtle movements when attacking, or even those instinctive reactions, she could imitate them all very well!</p><p></p><p>Disguising herself to infiltrate and obtain intelligence was what she excelled at!</p><p></p><p>Who on earth could have captured her?!</p><p></p><p>The others were also unwilling to believe that this news was true.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible? Was Lin'er's disguise technique seen through by someone?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this intelligence reliable? Are you sure Lin'er has been captured?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be false information released by Ying Zheng?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri was not concerned about Mo Yu Qilin. He spread his hands and said, "Believe it or not, I'm just telling you the intelligence Luo Wang obtained."</p><p></p><p>Having lost a capable subordinate like Mo Yu Qilin, Wei Zhuang's mood was very bad at this moment.</p><p></p><p>With a grim expression, he said, "I want to know the details of what happened."</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri began to recount the intelligence he had learned.</p><p></p><p>"Not long after Mo Yu Qilin infiltrated the palace, she disguised herself as a palace maid and mixed into Consort Shu's palace."</p><p></p><p>"Everything seemed to be going smoothly, but at night, after she left Consort Shu's palace, she was captured by the Shadow Guards at the edge of the inner palace."</p><p></p><p>"When the Shadow Guards captured her, she was already bleeding from her seven orifices and had fallen unconscious."</p><p></p><p>"The above is the event intelligence obtained by Luo Wang."</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang quickly grasped the key point, "So, Lin'er was already injured before being captured by the Shadow Guards?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri nodded, confirming Wei Zhuang's statement.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a few seconds, Wei Zhuang said, "I understand. Lin'er must have encountered that mysterious person you mentioned, which is why she ended up in an injured state."</p><p></p><p>"It seems this mysterious person is indeed very powerful, to be able to see through Lin'er's movements!"</p><p></p><p>Aside from her disguise techniques, Mo Yu Qilin was also one of the best at concealing her tracks.</p><p></p><p>Just who is this mysterious person?!</p><p></p><p>To possess such immense strength?</p><p></p><p>Jianghu</p><p></p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Among them, have such masters appeared recently? </p><p></p><p>Why would such a master appear in Ying Zheng's harem?</p><p></p><p>One question after another emerged in Wei Zhuang's heart.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Wei Zhuang regretted a little that he had rashly sent out Mo Yu Qilin without finding out clearly.</p><p></p><p>But Mo Yu Qilin was indeed the best candidate he could think of at the time.</p><p></p><p>If even Mo Yu Qilin would be discovered, anyone else would be discovered even more so.</p><p></p><p>Their top priority now was to immediately go to the Shi Ya Prison to rescue Mo Yu Qilin and Gai Nie.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang looked at Yan Ri: "Tell us the intelligence about Shi Ya Prison."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Wei Zhuang's request, Yan Ri shook his head and said, "Mo Yu Qilin did not find out the detailed situation of the harem, and our transaction has not been completed."</p><p></p><p>The implication was that he was unwilling to reveal the intelligence of Shi Ya Prison.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang drew his sword, and the shark teeth flashed a fierce light under the sun, showing the owner's cold killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Lin'er is very likely to have already fought with that person. As long as we rescue Lin'er, we will know what you want to know. You just need to be a little flexible."</p><p></p><p>"Or, do you want to experience the power of the shark teeth?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri could feel the strong killing intent condensed on the shark tooth sword.</p><p></p><p>He dared to be sure that if he spoke the words of refusal, Wei Zhuang would really take action.</p><p></p><p>This shark tooth sword would definitely attack him!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the other members of Liusha would definitely not sit idly by, and would inevitably help Wei Zhuang in the battle.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Yan Ri compromised: "I can hand over the intelligence of Shi Ya Prison, but Luo Wang will not go with you to rescue people. This is your Liusha's matter."</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang's voice was cold: "Liusha's people, Liusha will save them themselves."</p><p></p><p>From the beginning, he did not expect that the people of Luo Wang would help them.</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri nodded and handed over the intelligence of Shi Ya Prison.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the intelligence, Yan Ri left.</p><p></p><p>The people of Liusha did not stop him again.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang looked at the crowd of Liusha and ordered, "Go to Shi Ya Prison and rescue Lin'er."</p><p></p><p>As long as they rescued Lin'er, they would know who the mysterious person really was.</p><p></p><p>They would know how powerful he really was.</p><p></p><p>Everything would be revealed.</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian asked, "What about Gai Nie?"</p><p></p><p>If they went to Shi Ya Prison, they would naturally encounter Gai Nie there.</p><p></p><p>What should they do with him then?</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian actually vaguely understood the answer to this question.</p><p></p><p>But she couldn't help but want to ask Wei Zhuang and see his reaction.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang paused for a moment and said, "We haven't fought for a long time. Let's go and see if his sword has rusted."</p><p></p><p>PS: Please give flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thanks to all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>Three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>

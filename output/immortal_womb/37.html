        <h1>Chapter 37</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Bai Feng turned around and saw that the speaker was Zhang Liang. She exclaimed in surprise, "It's you?!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang bowed to the people of Flowing Sand and said, "Long time no see. Zhang Liang pays his respects to Princess Red Lotus."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that it was Zhang Liang, Chi Lian's expression softened slightly and she let down her guard. </p><p></p><p>"So it's you, Xiao Liangzi. But you misspoke - there is no Princess Red Lotus here, only Chi Lian."</p><p></p><p>From the day Chi Lian chose to assassinate Ji Wuye but failed and was saved by Wei Zhuang, she gave up her princess identity. The only one remaining here was Chi Lian.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang nodded, understanding Chi Lian's thoughts. </p><p></p><p>However, hearing the name "Xiao Liangzi" still made him dazed for a moment.</p><p></p><p>He sighed, "It's been so long since I've heard that name."</p><p></p><p>Time passes too quickly; the past seems like a fleeting dream.</p><p></p><p>After a brief exchange of pleasantries, Zhang Liang asked the people of Flowing Sand for confirmation, "Where's Wei Zhuang? Has he really entered Demon Fang Prison?"</p><p></p><p>At the mention of this, Chi Lian's expression fell and she nodded.</p><p></p><p>Then she remembered Zhang Liang's abilities. Harboring a sliver of hope, she asked Zhang Liang, "Xiao Liangzi, you've always been resourceful and clever. Do you have a way to save Lord Wei Zhuang?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang sighed and said, "Actually, I came this time intending to rescue someone from Demon Fang Prison. But I didn't expect Lord Wei Zhuang to be so impatient that he went straight in."</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian was overjoyed, "Rescue someone? You have a way to save people from Demon Fang Prison?"</p><p></p><p>Right now, Wei Zhuang had probably already been imprisoned in Demon Fang Prison. </p><p></p><p>If Zhang Liang really had a way to rescue people from Demon Fang Prison, then there was still hope of saving Wei Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the hopeful look on Chi Lian's face, Zhang Liang replied truthfully, "If we had Lord Wei Zhuang, things would be much simpler. But now that Lord Wei Zhuang is also trapped inside, we must plan for the long term."</p><p></p><p>"Come, follow me. I'll introduce you to some friends."</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian looked around, puzzled, "Friends? Where?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang smiled slightly and said, "Just follow me. What, do you not trust me?"</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian, Bai Feng and the others exchanged glances. </p><p></p><p>They had just been fooled by a trap, so trusting someone again in a short period of time was not an easy choice.</p><p></p><p>But after thinking it over, they had no better options.</p><p></p><p>Demon Fang Prison itself was a place full of traps and mechanisms. It would be very difficult for them to rescue someone from Demon Fang Prison on their own.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, without Wei Zhuang, they had lost a powerful fighter. </p><p></p><p>Their only choice now was to trust Zhang Liang.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang was a resourceful person. Perhaps he really did have a way to change the current situation.</p><p></p><p>Having made up their minds, the Flowing Sand organization chose to believe in Zhang Liang and cooperate with him.</p><p></p><p>Upon this, the members of the Flowing Sand organization followed Zhang Liang and departed.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the Shu Fei Palace, Ying Chen was cultivating again.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, Ying Chen discovered that the Imperial Qi within his body had begun to surge once more.</p><p></p><p>Compared to before, this time the Imperial Qi was like a small volcano erupting.</p><p></p><p>It was continuously absorbed by Ying Chen.</p><p></p><p>However, he had already become accustomed to this situation of occasional surges.</p><p></p><p>He estimated that it was because Zheng Ge had done something again to change the Great Qin, causing the Imperial Qi to surge.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen absorbed the continuous flow of Imperial Qi and continued cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he finally broke through to the ninth layer of the Imperial Qi Realm.</p><p></p><p>But he did not stop there and continued cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Because this time, he obtained a lot of Imperial Qi, comparable to when Gai Nie was captured.</p><p></p><p>He planned to keep breaking through in one go, and maybe he could directly reach the Foundation Establishment Realm.</p><p></p><p>Until he cultivated to the peak of the ninth layer of the Imperial Qi Realm, the surging Imperial Qi in Ying Chen's body gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen was full of anticipation. He could feel that his realm was loosening and already showing signs of a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>This time, as soon as he broke through, he would immediately be able to reach the Imperial Qi Foundation Establishment Realm.</p><p></p><p>Which was his small goal from the beginning.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, under Ying Chen's cultivation, his realm broke through again, directly reaching the Imperial Qi Foundation Establishment Realm!</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen instantly felt that he was different from before.</p><p></p><p>This time, his spiritual power had been greatly enhanced!</p><p></p><p>This was his newly acquired powerful ability - the Imperial Dao Pressure.</p><p></p><p>As the name suggests, the Imperial Dao Pressure refers to Ying Chen's ability to use his own pressure as a weapon to directly suppress the spiritual power of his enemies.</p><p></p><p>Enemies whose spiritual power differs too greatly from his own can be rendered powerless with a single Imperial Dao Pressure, leaving them at his mercy.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this ability ignores the number of enemies.</p><p></p><p>Whether it's one person or thousands of troops and horses, they are all the same in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He can suppress them with his own spiritual power based solely on his own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>In this way, it's no longer about taking the head of an enemy amidst a myriad of troops, but rather having the myriad of troops submit before him!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had a premonition that as he grew stronger, this ability would have other wonderful uses.</p><p></p><p>It's definitely not as simple as having just this one effect, and is at least as strong as, if not stronger than, an ability called Conqueror's Haki.</p><p></p><p>Because Conqueror's Haki is only a basic skill within his pressure, and he still has a lot of room for improvement.</p><p></p><p>With this skill, he won't even need to take action himself in the future.</p><p></p><p>He can directly release his pressure to suppress.</p><p></p><p>PS: Please give flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thank you to all the ancestors!</p><p></p><p>Feilu Novel, Fei wants you to have a good read!</p>

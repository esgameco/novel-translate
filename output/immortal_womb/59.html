        <h1>Chapter 59</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Facing the astonished gazes of the two women, Ying Chen remained calm and composed.</p><p></p><p>He looked down at them from his elevated position.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he asked, "Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>Both women were wrapped in tight-fitting night clothes, their faces covered tightly except for their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, apart from being women, their other identities could not be discerned.</p><p></p><p>The two women from the Yin-Yang family had not yet recovered from the baby's strange movements.</p><p></p><p>Abruptly hearing the baby suddenly speak,</p><p></p><p>both of them were greatly shocked!</p><p></p><p>Their pupils constricted slightly, and the breath exhaled from their delicate noses became heavier!</p><p></p><p>Clearly, they had not expected this baby-like person to be able to speak.</p><p></p><p>They had originally thought that this baby was acting on instinct.</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed that was not the case at all!</p><p></p><p>This baby already possessed the wisdom of an adult!</p><p></p><p>This was troublesome!</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the two women kept their mouths shut, not uttering a word, afraid of revealing their true identities.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen could see that the two had no intention of speaking, seemingly using silence as a form of resistance.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen sneered, "Not talking? Then I'll beat you until you do."</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because they hadn't encountered such an arrogant opponent in so many years, but Da Si Ming was not the least bit concerned.</p><p></p><p>She didn't take his words to heart, instead coldly retorting, "Beat us then, you really think we're afraid of you?"</p><p></p><p>Their Yin-Yang family had developed for so many years, and they were no pushovers.</p><p></p><p>There was no reason to cower like turtles when challenged.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the reply, Ying Chen knew that these two had no intention of revealing their identities.</p><p></p><p>He waved his water sword, drawing a fierce arc in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Whether you're afraid or not, you'll know once you've tried."</p><p></p><p>With these words, the two from the Yin-Yang family knew that this battle was inevitable and unavoidable.</p><p></p><p>They had to make a move to determine who was superior.</p><p></p><p>This baby could not be dealt with using simple techniques.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Da Si Ming no longer had any intention of probing with simple moves.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to end it with one fatal strike!</p><p></p><p>Da Si Ming's hands moved apart, and a red and black light appeared in her palms.</p><p></p><p>Within that red and black light, a taiji-like pattern appeared, condensing into an ominous Yin-Yang Qi Merging Hand Seal.</p><p></p><p>Countless hand seals shot towards Ying Chen!</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen was not flustered in the slightest. With one hand, he reached to the side.</p><p></p><p>From the nearby pool, streams of water rapidly converged.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a constantly revolving water sphere formed around Ying Chen.</p><p></p><p>The water sphere looked as if it would shatter with a single touch, but it was incredibly resilient, directly blocking all the hand seals!</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen recognized this technique and suddenly realized, "Yin-Yang Qi Merging Hand Seal? So you're from the Yin-Yang family."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, if I'm not mistaken, you two must be Da Si Ming and Shao Si Ming."</p><p></p><p>The two women from the Yin-Yang family held their breath, suddenly feeling a chill in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>This infant actually knew the techniques of the Yin-Yang family?</p><p></p><p>And he recognized them with just one move?!</p><p></p><p>Who on earth was he?</p><p></p><p>The Great Siming stared at the infant, her mind swirling with infinite murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>No matter what this infant was.</p><p></p><p>Now they had to silence the infant!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, everything that happened tonight would be leaked out!</p><p></p><p>With the intention of killing to silence, the Great Siming used the secret technique of the Yin-Yang family - the Skull Blood Hand Seal.</p><p></p><p>Once activated, a huge blood skull handprint headed towards Ying Chen!</p><p></p><p>The speed was extraordinarily fast, almost too fast for the human eye to follow!</p><p></p><p>This move was immensely powerful. After hitting the human body, it could cause the opponent's body to become disordered, veins to flow in reverse, and die in extreme pain.</p><p></p><p>Very few people could withstand this blow.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this move was still firmly blocked by that water ball!</p><p></p><p>It didn't even touch Ying Chen's skin!</p><p></p><p>Her own attacks had been blocked twice in a row. The Great Siming's expression had already changed.</p><p></p><p>This infant actually used the same move to block her two attacks!</p><p></p><p>This showed that no matter his defense or reaction speed, they were all top-notch!</p><p></p><p>The Great Siming realized that they had encountered a tricky opponent whose strength might be above hers.</p><p></p><p>But before she could organize the next attack.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen had already made the first move.</p><p></p><p>He waved his water sword, gathering countless water balls of all sizes around him, and then headed towards the Great Siming.</p><p></p><p>Those water balls were fast, turning into countless ice spikes as they revolved in the air, enveloping the Great Siming.</p><p></p><p>Then, those razor-sharp ice spikes launched an attack on the Great Siming together!</p><p></p><p>It was an attack from all directions, continuous and unceasing.</p><p></p><p>In just a short moment, with so many attacks, the Great Siming couldn't defend at all.</p><p></p><p>The Great Siming was shocked in her heart, not understanding why a mere infant would have such superb strength.</p><p></p><p>Who on earth was this person?</p><p></p><p>Lost in thought, caught off guard, the Great Siming was hit by countless ice spikes.</p><p></p><p>She felt heat in her throat, spat out a mouthful of blood, collapsed to the ground and passed out.</p><p></p><p>The Lesser Siming, seeing the situation was dire, immediately used the Myriad Leaves Flying Flower Flow.</p><p></p><p>A large patch of leaves condensed, blocking between Ying Chen and the two of them.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to use this to block Ying Chen's line of sight and rescue the Great Siming.</p><p></p><p>Her plan was good, but unfortunately underestimated the opponent.</p><p></p><p>When she turned around, she found that Ying Chen, who was originally behind her, had reappeared in front of her eyes.</p><p></p><p>As if he had been there from the beginning!</p><p></p><p>The Lesser Siming was horrified in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Was this guy opposite really just an infant?</p><p></p><p>Why was he so strong?</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thanks to all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>Three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>

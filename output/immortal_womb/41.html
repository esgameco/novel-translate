        <h1>Chapter 41</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Upon hearing Zhao Gao's words, Hu Hai was startled.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao's intention was to directly eliminate Shu Fei?!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, this was an excellent method. Once a person dies, all the love and favor would be gone.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had long wanted to do this!</p><p></p><p>This woman was too much of an eyesore to him!</p><p></p><p>However, if Shu Fei was directly eliminated, and if the Emperor found out that he was involved...</p><p></p><p>With the Emperor's temperament, he would definitely not let him off easily!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Hu Hai couldn't help but shudder.</p><p></p><p>But if Shu Fei was not eliminated, what would happen if she continued to be promoted?</p><p></p><p>At the rate of Shu Fei's promotion, it wouldn't be long before her rank would surpass his mother's!</p><p></p><p>By then, if Shu Fei gave birth to another prince, wouldn't the status of this newborn prince surpass his own?</p><p></p><p>A newborn baby would surpass the status he had built up over so many years?</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about this possibility made Hu Hai gnash his teeth!</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Shu Fei or this child, they were both a big threat to him!</p><p></p><p>He would not allow anyone to step on his head!</p><p></p><p>It was better to eliminate them early, so he could have peace of mind!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Hu Hai no longer cared about the terrible consequences of being discovered by his father.</p><p></p><p>He hardened his heart and asked, "Zhao Gao, tell me, what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao opened his mouth, but before he could speak, he was suddenly interrupted by a commotion outside the door.</p><p></p><p>A group of eunuchs arrived outside the door, and the leading eunuch shouted, "Zhao Gao, the Prefect of the Central Secretariat, quickly receive the imperial decree!"</p><p></p><p>It was an imperial decree directly from the Emperor!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao and Hu Hai, not having time to be surprised, quickly knelt down to receive the decree.</p><p></p><p>The leading eunuch began to read the imperial decree.</p><p></p><p>After the long decree was read, there was only one core content.</p><p></p><p>The First Emperor ordered Zhao Gao to send experts from the Luo Wang to guard the Shi Ya Prison to prevent Gai Nie and Wei Zhuang from escaping.</p><p></p><p>This task must succeed and must not fail!</p><p></p><p>If it failed, there would be severe punishment!</p><p></p><p>Hearing the content of the decree, Zhao Gao was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The Shi Ya Prison had always been the responsibility of the Ying Mi Guards, so why was the Luo Wang now responsible for guarding it?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that His Majesty felt that the strength of the Ying Mi Guards was insufficient to guard the Shi Ya Prison?</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, it was good news for the Luo Wang.</p><p></p><p>The Ying Mi Guards had developed rapidly in recent years and had even shown signs of being able to go head-to-head with the Luo Wang.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao had long noticed this and regarded the Ying Mi Guards as a thorn in the side of the Luo Wang.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, His Majesty had always trusted the Ying Mi Guards and had given them many tasks, leaving the Luo Wang with few opportunities to prove themselves.</p><p></p><p>Now this...</p><p></p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This task was perfect for his Luo Web organization. </p><p></p><p>Luo Web just lacked an opportunity like this to prove themselves and demonstrate their immense power.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to make His Majesty understand that the capabilities of his Luo Web far exceeded those of the Shadow Guards.</p><p></p><p>His Majesty should rely on and make use of Luo Web, not the Shadow Guards!</p><p></p><p>If this mission succeeded, Luo Web's prestige would certainly rise greatly. </p><p></p><p>Not only would it increase His Majesty's favor towards Luo Web,</p><p></p><p>It would also be an opportunity to suppress the arrogance of the Shadow Guards.</p><p></p><p>Let the Shadow Guards understand how vast the gap was between them and Luo Web. </p><p></p><p>Make it clear that Luo Web was not an opponent they could surpass!</p><p></p><p>The lead eunuch, seeing Zhao Gao in a daze, glared at him and said, "Lord of the Central Carriage Department, why have you not yet received the decree?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao came back to his senses and hurriedly accepted the decree with respect.</p><p></p><p>The person beside Zhao Gao was very perceptive and immediately handed a thick pouch to the lead eunuch. </p><p></p><p>The lead eunuch squeezed the thickness of the pouch without any change in expression, a look of satisfaction appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>The originally stern eunuch instantly had a smile, and after a few polite exchanges, he left with his men.</p><p></p><p>Quiet returned to Prince Huhai's residence.</p><p></p><p>Huhai had also heard the contents of the imperial decree and understood that his imperial father had a task for Luo Web to handle.</p><p></p><p>He didn't think much of it, only worrying about one thing.</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Gao, Imperial Father ordered Luo Web's men to guard Demon Fang Prison? Then will the matter you spoke of earlier still proceed?"</p><p></p><p>Although Lady Shu was just one person, to secretly harm a consort of the rear palace, especially to do it without leaving any traces, required some thought and planning.</p><p></p><p>Huhai was worried Zhao Gao would hand this matter over to someone else because of the imperial decree.</p><p></p><p>This matter concerned his own life. Besides Zhao Gao, he didn't feel at ease entrusting it to anyone else.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao understood his misgivings and said with narrowed eyes, "The matter from earlier can only be temporarily put on hold. His Majesty's decree must be prioritized and obeyed."</p><p></p><p>His Majesty had already stated in the decree that failure of the mission would incur heavy punishment, which sufficiently indicated the importance His Majesty placed on this matter. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, Zhao Gao would not miss this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Huhai understood Zhao Gao's thoughts and nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>There was no other choice, it could only be like this.</p><p></p><p>In any case, Lady Shu was in the rear palace and had nowhere to go.</p><p></p><p>Waiting a while before taking action made no difference.</p><p></p><p>It was just that doing this let that woman Lady Shu off the hook and allowed her to live a while longer.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Huhai said resentfully, "Let that woman be arrogant a while longer then."</p>

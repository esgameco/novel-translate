        <h1>Chapter 62</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the Shu Fei Palace, the Emperor's grand carriage arrived at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Just as Ying Chen had just fallen asleep, Ying Zheng arrived.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing that the Emperor had arrived, Shu Fei immediately tidied herself up and stood up to pay her respects.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng immediately supported Shu Fei and did not let her perform the courtesy.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, as your body grows heavier, you can be exempted from these formalities in front of me."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Ying Zheng began to show concern for Shu Fei's well-being.</p><p></p><p>"The weather has been changing quite quickly recently. Do you have any discomfort?"</p><p></p><p>Not only did he exempt her from the courtesy, but he also showed such concern for her physical condition. This was something that an emperor would do, and it was a gesture that he would not make to anyone else!</p><p></p><p>Shu Fei was instantly overwhelmed by the favor.</p><p></p><p>She said softly, "I eat well and sleep soundly, and I have no worries. It is Your Majesty who should pay attention to the tiring work of handling political affairs and take care to rest."</p><p></p><p>Hearing that Shu Fei was still using her free time to care about him, Ying Zheng felt a warmth in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, he knew Shu Fei's considerate and gentle nature and was afraid that she might be enduring any discomfort.</p><p></p><p>Only after carefully confirming that she was indeed not injured or ill did he feel slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>Then he took Shu Fei's hand and asked her to go back to sleep so that she would not be in poor spirits.</p><p></p><p>Now that it was almost dawn, how could Shu Fei still fall asleep?</p><p></p><p>Especially with an emperor sitting beside her, how could she possibly continue to sleep?</p><p></p><p>So she made an excuse that she was not sleepy and wanted to sit down and chat with His Majesty.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng could not force her, so he had to sit down and chat with Shu Fei for a while.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, Ying Zheng's expression became tense again.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly realized that he had been here for so long and had not heard a single word from his heart!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that something had happened to the stinky little boy inside?</p><p></p><p>At the thought of this possibility, Ying Zheng became anxious and uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the fetus has been affected? Let's call the imperial physician to take a look!"</p><p></p><p>Shu Fei herself did not feel anything, but Ying Zheng still insisted on summoning the imperial physician without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>The imperial physician suddenly received a summons from the emperor, and the eunuch who came kept urging him anxiously, thinking that something big had happened.</p><p></p><p>He hurried to Shu Fei's bedchamber, running all the way.</p><p></p><p>By the time he arrived, he was covered in sweat, soaking his clothes.</p><p></p><p>The imperial physician did not dare to be negligent. Regardless of his own condition, he immediately took Shu Fei's pulse and examined her, asking many questions about her condition.</p><p></p><p>After all the examinations, the final result was that Shu Fei was very healthy and had no problems at all.</p><p></p><p>When the imperial physician announced this conclusion, everyone breathed a sigh of relief, especially the eunuchs and palace maids who served her.</p><p></p><p>If something had happened to Shu Fei at this juncture, their heads would surely not be spared!</p><p></p><p>After hearing this conclusion, Ying Zheng still looked nervous and asked,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"What about the child? Is the child alright?"</p><p></p><p>The royal physician was slightly surprised by this question, but still patiently answered: "The child is naturally fine too, very healthy. At this time, the child should be sound asleep."</p><p></p><p>Only after confirming the child was fine did Ying Zheng put his mind at ease. </p><p></p><p>This child is related to the future of Great Qin! It's good that there's no problem!</p><p></p><p>With the weight off his mind, Ying Zheng finally had the mindset to deal with tonight's matter.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng let Shu Fei go rest in the inner chamber.</p><p></p><p>Then he angrily said in the main hall: "Where is Zhang Han? Tell him to come see me immediately!"</p><p></p><p>Before long, Zhang Han received the order and came. </p><p></p><p>He knelt down with a thud: "This subordinate failed to protect Shu Fei. Please forgive me, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng looked at Zhang Han coldly: "You are guilty, but now is not the time to pursue responsibility. Have the assassins been caught?"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this matter, Zhang Han felt extremely ashamed.</p><p></p><p>He lowered his head and replied: "When this subordinate arrived, I only saw the assassins' retreating figures from afar. They should be two women, but their skills were very strong and the Shadow Guards were unable to stop them."</p><p></p><p>"However, besides this, the Shadow Guards discovered traces of the Luo Web near where they escaped."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing that people from the Luo Web participated in this night's intrusion into Shu Fei's palace, Ying Zheng immediately erupted in towering rage!</p><p></p><p>"The Luo Web?! Zhao Gao is so bold! Does he really think I don't dare to move against the Luo Web?"</p><p></p><p>Ever since learning that the Luo Web was spying on the imperial harem with disloyal intentions, Ying Zheng had detested the Luo Web to the bone!</p><p></p><p>Previously, he just didn't have a free hand to deal with the Luo Web.</p><p></p><p>Later, thinking of using the Luo Web to strike at the Mohists, he held his nose and endured it.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought the Luo Web would be so brazen!</p><p></p><p>They actually dared to reach their hands so far as to intrude into the imperial harem with the intent to assassinate Shu Fei!</p><p></p><p>Fortunately it was discovered early this time and they were not allowed to succeed!</p><p></p><p>If they had succeeded and this son was lost, his Great Qin would be ruined!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the dire consequences, Ying Zheng's fury reached its peak!</p><p></p><p>The people of the Luo Web deserve to die! The one behind it pulling the strings deserves death even more!</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng coldly ordered: "Immediately mobilize all Shadow Guards and the Imperial Guard to secretly investigate and grasp the whereabouts of all the Luo Web assassins. I want a list and information on all members of the Luo Web."</p><p></p><p>"If this matter is not handled well again, the two crimes will be punished together. Zhang Han, you see to it yourself."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han's heart trembled, hearing the thick murderous intent in these two sentences. </p><p></p><p>It seems His Majesty is going to take action against the Luo Web!</p><p></p><p>He, Zhang Han, is to be one of the sharp swords in this!</p><p></p><p>If not put to good use, then in the future there will no longer be any use for him!</p><p></p><p>He must prove his worth and absolutely cannot fail again!</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han accepted the order and left.</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thanks to all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>Feilu Novels, Fei wants you to have a good read!</p>

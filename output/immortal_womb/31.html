        <h1>Chapter 31</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Upon hearing about the matter of rescuing Gai Nie, the crowd immediately became agitated and voiced their opposition.</p><p></p><p>Not only did Gai Nie have nothing to do with them, but he also caused the death of Jing Ke. Why should they go and save him?</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang waved his hand to let the crowd settle down.</p><p></p><p>Then he began to talk about another matter.</p><p></p><p>"Do you all know? Recently, a papermaking technique suddenly appeared in Xianyang, which can replace bamboo slips for writing. Not only is it lighter than bamboo slips, but it is also low-cost."</p><p></p><p>"It is said to be something that Ying Zheng instructed to make. Don't you all find it strange? Why would Ying Zheng suddenly do such a thing?"</p><p></p><p>"This and the matter of Gai Nie are both equally sudden. I believe this is still the work of the person behind Ying Zheng. If we don't figure out who this person is and what his purpose is, our great undertaking of opposing Qin cannot begin."</p><p></p><p>He finally concluded, "Everyone, don't forget who our real enemy is. Gai Nie is no longer Ying Zheng's subordinate, at least not since the day he chose to defect."</p><p></p><p>"Ying Zheng has already thrown him into the Shi Ya Prison. At this time, the two of them are in a life-and-death relationship."</p><p></p><p>"And this mysterious person behind Ying Zheng, he is our true enemy. He influences Ying Zheng's decisions."</p><p></p><p>"We must obtain as much intelligence as possible about this person. Gai Nie has been by Ying Zheng's side for a long time, so he is a good breakthrough point."</p><p></p><p>The Mohist leader pondered for a moment and said, "As far as I know, Gai Nie is now being held in Shi Ya Prison. It's not easy to rescue someone from there."</p><p></p><p>When Gao Jianli and others heard this, they found it somewhat unacceptable that the leader actually had the intention to rescue him.</p><p></p><p>"I don't understand. Why should we go and rescue that Gai Nie?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right. Gai Nie killed Jing Ke in the past!"</p><p></p><p>"Rescuing Gai Nie, isn't that rescuing an enemy?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Hearing these doubts, the leader remained calm.</p><p></p><p>After everyone had finished speaking, he spoke, "I know you all have considerable objections to Gai Nie."</p><p></p><p>"But I believe that if our plan is to succeed, we must unite all forces."</p><p></p><p>"Sword Saint Gai Nie is one of the forces that cannot be ignored, both in terms of strength and the intelligence he possesses, which are what we need."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang nodded, "That's right. We should put aside our prejudices against Gai Nie and focus on our goal. Isn't this what we should do most?"</p><p></p><p>The voices of opposition from the crowd gradually diminished, seemingly persuaded by the leader and Zhang Liang.</p><p></p><p>Only Gao Jianli remained silent.</p><p></p><p>As Jing Ke's close friend, he still could not forgive Gai Nie, but he also could not refute the leader.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although Gai Nie, who caused the death of his good friend, was certainly hateful, when it came to the great undertaking of opposing Qin, it was not just his own matter. </p><p></p><p>It was a matter of life and death for everyone here, and it was impossible to let him be willful.</p><p></p><p>Ju Zi asked Zhang Liang: "Since it was you who proposed to rescue Gai Nie, you must already have a plan. How do you want to save him?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang took out the pigeon letter he had just received and said, "Just recently, Mo Yu Qilin of Flowing Sand was also sent to Shi Ya Prison. Flowing Sand may be able to become our aid."</p><p></p><p>Dao Zhi raised an objection: "The leader of Flowing Sand is that Wei Zhuang. He and Gai Nie are both disciples of Gui Gu and have always been at odds with each other. Are you sure Flowing Sand will help?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang smiled slightly and said, "The Gui Gu disciples being at odds with each other is only an ideological dispute. In fact, if Wei Zhuang knows that Gai Nie has been captured, he will definitely go to rescue him."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Zhang Liang was quite confident, Ju Zi then said, "Since you have already thought it through, then tell us the detailed plan."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang nodded and began to explain his plan.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the Shu Fei Palace, it was originally a scene of peace.</p><p></p><p>The arrival of Ying Zheng stirred up a small ripple here.</p><p></p><p>The palace maids and eunuchs knelt down in a large group. </p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng signaled to exempt the courtesy and walked straight towards Shu Fei's inner chamber.</p><p></p><p>The palace people felt happy for Shu Fei's favor, not knowing that the emperor's thoughts were not at all what they imagined.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng came this time because he remembered the unrest in the Northern Man and always felt a little uneasy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although he was already prepared to send Meng Tian to lead the troops, what if this arrangement was inappropriate? </p><p></p><p>This battle was related to the safety of the entire Qin.</p><p></p><p>So after thinking about it, Ying Zheng felt that it was safer to come and ask his good son.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Ying Zheng deliberately asked Shu Fei: "Shu Fei, who do you think is more suitable for me to send to deal with this Northern Man unrest? Wang Beng, Meng Tian, or Wang Li?"</p><p></p><p>When Shu Fei heard the emperor ask such a question, her eyes widened and she was stunned for a few seconds.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty is joking. How can a weak woman like me know about such a major national affair?"</p><p></p><p>God knows, she didn't even remember those people's names just now, let alone what they actually do.</p><p></p><p>Ask her? It would be pitch black in front of her eyes, and it would be better to go for divination.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng of course knew that Shu Fei could not possibly answer.</p><p></p><p>He nodded, without blaming her.</p><p></p><p>He didn't speak, pretending to read a book, but his ears had already quietly perked up.</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to hear what kind of advice Ying Chen would give.</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thanks to all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>Feilu Novels, Fei wants you to have a good read!</p>

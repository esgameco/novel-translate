            <p>Meng Tian had agreed to make paper for himself, so he started working on it without delay.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, at Meng Tian's residence.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng looked at the thin sheets of paper, his hands trembling with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Really, it worked?</p><p></p><p>It was done in just a few days?</p><p></p><p>Is this the paper that the child spoke of?</p><p></p><p>It's amazing!</p><p></p><p>It's just as the child said, very thin and light.</p><p></p><p>Holding it in the hand, you can hardly feel any weight!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, when writing on it with a brush, it dries in no time.</p><p></p><p>Unlike bamboo slips, which absorb ink so slowly.</p><p></p><p>And a few sheets of paper stacked together basically take up no space.</p><p></p><p>The writing area is also larger than bamboo slips.</p><p></p><p>In short, compared to bamboo slips, paper has too many advantages!</p><p></p><p>If this kind of paper is popularized, people will no longer have to carry heavy bamboo slips in the future!</p><p></p><p>Meng Tian, who made the paper, was also very excited.</p><p></p><p>This kind of paper is not only lightweight but can also be folded!</p><p></p><p>The smallest can be folded to the size of a fingernail!</p><p></p><p>If paper can be used to transmit intelligence on the battlefield, it will be so convenient and concealed!</p><p></p><p>Even if the intelligence is discovered, it can be destroyed by hand without leaving it to the enemy.</p><p></p><p>Cutting is much more convenient, and even when bound into a book, it is far less complicated than the original bamboo slips, and can be completed by one person!</p><p></p><p>It can be imagined that with bamboo slips, more people in the Qin state will recognize the written language.</p><p></p><p>More people will understand Your Majesty's decrees.</p><p></p><p>This is simply an epoch-making invention!</p><p></p><p>He used the method Your Majesty mentioned and experimented many times without rest for the past few days, and it really worked!</p><p></p><p>Those materials, if not for what Your Majesty said, he might never have thought of in his life!</p><p></p><p>Things that people consider garbage, when combined together, actually became precious paper!</p><p></p><p>Meng Tian sighed, "Where did Your Majesty learn about papermaking? Could it be that Your Majesty came up with it yourself? Your Majesty is truly a heaven-sent genius, admirable!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Meng Tian's flattery, Ying Zheng shook his head without thinking, "If this was a method I came up with myself, I would have done it long ago, how could I wait until now?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Tian looked puzzled. If it wasn't His Majesty's idea, where did this method come from?</p><p></p><p>In the past, whether in books or from other people, he had never heard of such a method of papermaking.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng coughed and said, "Anyway, don't worry about where this method came from. I naturally have my own sources of information. You will know in the future, so don't ask now."</p><p></p><p>Since the monarch was unwilling to say, as a minister, he certainly couldn't keep asking.</p><p></p><p>Meng Tian could only marvel from another angle, "Once this thing is popularized, it can be called a benefit..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"In the present age, your achievements will be remembered for a thousand autumns. Your Majesty has accomplished such great deeds yet remains humble, which I deeply admire," Meng Tian praised.</p><p></p><p>This flattery hit right at the core of Ying Zheng's heart. With a look of pride, he said, "I am the First Emperor, having laid the foundation for ten thousand generations. Why should I care about a little fame and credit?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Tian continued to heap praises upon him. </p><p></p><p>In fact, it wasn't that Ying Zheng didn't want to take credit, but he really didn't want to wait until that impertinent brat was born and then mock him for taking advantage. As the emperor who had conquered the six states, he greatly cherished his tall and dignified image. Competing with his own son for merit? Just the thought made him embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Now that papermaking had succeeded, the next issue was how to handle this papermaking technique. </p><p></p><p>Meng Tian didn't dare decide on his own and asked, "Your Majesty, what shall we do next? Should this papermaking technique be kept secret?"</p><p></p><p>Such a valuable technology, no matter whose hands it was in, would generate enormous profits. If the official government produced the paper themselves, every sheet would carry the scent of money!</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng naturally understood Meng Tian's implication. But after a moment's thought, he shook his head and said, "No need. Let's proclaim the papermaking technique to the world."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Meng Tian was quite puzzled, "Your Majesty, why is that? If the government controls this technology, it will surely bring in considerable revenue for the state treasury."</p><p></p><p>How could Ying Zheng not understand this principle? He could foresee that the advent of paper would quickly replace bamboo slips and bring about huge profits. </p><p></p><p>But as a monarch, he saw further. Gazing into the distance, he said, "First, the papermaking process is not difficult. As long as one obtains the finished paper, skilled artisans will quickly figure it out."</p><p></p><p>"Second, the cost of paper is not high. If it's monopolized by the government, this advantage would vanish. It might even cause disputes between merchants and the people over profits."</p><p></p><p>"Rather than that, it's better to openly release the raw materials and technology, allowing everyone to make paper themselves and use it."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Meng Tian was in awe. The First Emperor had such vision. Compared to him, Meng Tian was still caught up in petty profits, which was truly shameful. </p><p></p><p>Meng Tian accepted the order, "Your subordinate will not fail Your Majesty's wishes and will spread the papermaking technique!"</p><p></p><p>He then went to carry out the work of promoting papermaking. Soon, the technique spread throughout the land. The entire Qin dynasty was greatly stirred by this thin sheet of paper!</p><p></p><p>PS: 10 updates daily.

        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Huang Li's death did not cause any ripples in Lincheng. </p><p></p><p>Because no one knew that Huang Li died at Zhou You's hands, not even anyone knew that Huang Li had already died.</p><p></p><p>After tallying the spoils of war, Zhou You learned the "Qian Shen Shu" technique a few days later, and then went to the Fish Protector's place.</p><p></p><p>The Fish Protector's place was still just a few fish protectors gathering together, drinking tea and chatting. Each of their cultivation levels was stuck at the first level of Qi refining. Chatting with them allowed Zhou You to obtain a lot of information about Lincheng. </p><p></p><p>Zhou You had gotten quite familiar with them during this period of time. He easily learned from their conversations that there had been no news of Huang Li in Lincheng for a long time. Most people deduced that Huang Li must have left Lincheng.</p><p></p><p>Apart from this, Zhou You also obtained another piece of information.</p><p></p><p>That was about the great young master of the Lin family, Lin Feng, who had angrily risen up after being rejected by Xiao Yueyingying and single-handedly annihilated the Righteous Alliance. He had also joined the Taibai Academy.</p><p></p><p>It was said that it was in order to obtain a certain inheritance from the Taibai Academy.</p><p></p><p>Including scions from cultivator clans like Xiao Yueyingying, they all joined the Taibai Academy for the sake of that inheritance.</p><p></p><p>However, those fish protectors did not know what exactly that inheritance was.</p><p></p><p>After returning to his wooden hut, Zhou You continued cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Now his plan was very clear - to first cultivate the things he had on hand and record them into the golden seal of "The Way of Simplicity."</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the top priority was the middle section of the "Kai Mai Jue," which was crucial for Zhou You to improve his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You spent a full six days before finally managing to record the middle section of the "Kai Mai Jue" into the golden seal, making a bit of progress.</p><p></p><p>In other words, under normal circumstances, to fully cultivate the middle section and reach the sixth level of Qi refining would require 600 days, over a year and a half.</p><p></p><p>But Zhou You was not in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation was something that required perseverance.</p><p></p><p>Without diligent effort, how could one hope to travel thousands of miles?</p><p></p><p>Apart from the "Kai Mai Jue," there was also the Fire Bead Technique, which was equally important.</p><p></p><p>This was Zhou You's first true spell. Zhou You attached great importance to it and spent most of his time every day practicing the Fire Bead Technique.</p><p></p><p>After that was the equally important "Qian Shen Shu"!</p><p></p><p>The Qian Shen Shu could be used to conceal one's cultivation level. It was a means that Zhou You had long dreamed of.</p><p></p><p>Once he mastered the Qian Shen Shu, he could execute his previous plan.</p><p></p><p>The first step was to go to the Inner Sect and purchase the Disguise Technique.</p><p></p><p>The second step was to learn the Disguise Technique, then sell off the excess spirit fish he had to accumulate spirit stones, in order to purchase Foundation Establishment cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>The third step was to purchase some herb seeds and try growing medicinal herbs himself to see if it could shorten the cultivation period. If it could shorten the period, that would be extremely important for Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, he would continue to deepen the skills recorded in the golden seal.</p><p></p><p>Especially the profound-level skills of "Chopping" and "Polishing" that Zhou You greatly anticipated.</p><p></p><p>At dusk, Zhou You sat by Erhai Lake, watching the sunset over the Cang Mountains and Erhai Lake. The golden ocean rippled with shimmering waves, the willow branches swayed gently, and Zhou You's face gradually turned golden too.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was slowly inhaling and exhaling.</p><p></p><p>This type of breathing was different from the breathing during cultivation.</p><p></p><p>If there was a cultivator above the third level of Qi refining present, they would be able to sense Zhou You's cultivation aura gradually decreasing step by step.</p><p></p><p>Initially, it was the third level of Qi refining.</p><p></p><p>As Zhou You breathed, after a few breaths, it decreased to the second level of Qi refining.</p><p></p><p>After a few more breaths, it decreased to the first level of Qi refining.</p><p></p><p>After decreasing to the first level of Qi refining, it seemed to still be decreasing, but not very noticeably.</p><p></p><p>"Huff--"</p><p></p><p>"The Qian Shen Shu can currently only control my cultivation level to this extent. If it was fully mastered, it should be possible to control it to before the Qi refining stage."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You opened his eyes and looked at the boundless sunset. The red sun dropped behind the Cang Mountains at this moment, merging into the snowy peaks.</p><p></p><p>He took out two spirit fish from his Fish Protector pouch, processed them, and returned home to roast the spirit fish.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After the burning of an incense stick, a rich fragrance wafted out from the wooden hut, making one's mouth water.</p><p></p><p>[Grilled Fish (100/100): A rather complicated subject, one can succeed by grilling a hundred fish.]  </p><p></p><p>As the spiritual fish was successfully grilled, the golden seal within Zhou You's spiritual realm also began to flicker, reminding him that the [Grilled Fish] skill had been perfected.</p><p></p><p>Streams of mysterious golden power gushed out from the golden seal, fusing into Zhou You's limbs and meridians.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You raised his brows slightly, his spiritual sense scanning, quickly grasping the situation within twenty zhang (about 60 meters) clearly.</p><p></p><p>Even his spirit became much more full, his entire being sharp in hearing and sight, as if the world had been refreshed before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual sense range of twenty zhang...it seems that after completing grilled fish, it increased my spiritual power, enhancing my spiritual sense and concentration. Now my spiritual sense is equivalent to the strength of the sixth layer of Qi refining! If I employ the Mind Condensing Art, even a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator may not be able to see through my cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>Feeling the changes within himself, Zhou You couldn't help but smile.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual sense only emerges at the third layer of Qi refining.</p><p></p><p>Each advancement in cultivation can enhance the spiritual sense, increasing exponentially.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual sense range of the third layer of Qi refining is only one zhang. The fourth layer is five zhang, and each subsequent increase doubles - the fifth layer is ten zhang, and the sixth layer is twenty zhang!</p><p></p><p>Now Zhou You's spiritual sense range reached twenty zhang, equivalent to the sixth layer of Qi refining's spiritual sense range.</p><p></p><p>This made Zhou You very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After another ten days or so, when it was time for Zhou You's fourth delivery of spiritual fish, the 'Mind Condensing Art' was finally perfected.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You could easily control his cultivation to appear below the first layer of Qi refining. Even a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator would be unable to discern his true cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Carefully calculating, Zhou You had begun his cultivation four months ago.</p><p></p><p>During these ten-odd days, Zhou You finally caught a spiritual fish different from before - a beautiful pale blue spiritual fish.</p><p></p><p>According to Zhou You's guess, that should be a first-grade middle-quality spiritual fish!</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, in the following days Zhou You caught several more of those pale blue spiritual fish. According to the prompts from the 'Way of Simplicity' golden seal, these fish were indeed first-grade middle-quality spiritual fish!</p><p></p><p>On this day, he handed the spiritual fish over to Xiao Qing, waiting as usual in the outer courtyard for Xiao Qing to return.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these spiritual fish did not include the first-grade middle-quality ones.</p><p></p><p>Very soon, Xiao Qing did indeed come to the outer courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Originally thinking he could leave quickly, Zhou You did not expect Xiao Qing to say to him after arriving: "Big Brother You, your great opportunity has come. The young lady is very satisfied with your performance and requests you to enter the inner courtyard to see her!"</p><p></p><p>The servants who had come to befriend Zhou You, upon hearing this, could not help showing envious expressions.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that being summoned by the young lady was a blessing from their past lives for them.</p><p></p><p>If they could receive a reward from the young lady, that would be heavenly luck.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations Brother Zhou, you really are soaring with the wind! And even have the honor of being summoned by the young lady!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, Big Brother You, don't forget us in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhou is too powerful. After completing the task of fishing for spiritual fish, he'll definitely become a servant of the clan when he returns!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhou, we've bought some wine and dishes to celebrate you!"</p><p></p><p>Those servants chattered noisily, offering congratulations to Zhou You one after another.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You smiled in response, but inwardly he was puzzled and even a little wary.</p><p></p><p>Why was Xiao Yue Ying becoming more and more polite?</p><p></p><p>Even summoning him, a lowly fish servant?</p><p></p><p>But no matter what, since Xiao Yue Ying had requested him, he could not refuse. He could only nod.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for leading the way."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You smiled and followed behind Xiao Qing, entering the inner courtyard for the first time amid the envious gazes of the many servants.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

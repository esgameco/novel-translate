        <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Thundering Fist is a supreme martial art in the mortal realm. Its power in the mortal realm is extremely formidable. After mastering it, one can unleash strands of lightning force, and its momentum is immense. </p><p></p><p>According to Zhou You's speculation, if used unexpectedly and combined with magical power, the Thundering Fist could pose a threat to low-level cultivators who practice internal energy.</p><p></p><p>Of course, what Zhou You looked forward to the most was the physical enhancement that would come from fully mastering the Thundering Fist.</p><p></p><p>Initially, the Sword of Light and Shadow allowed him to embark on the path of body refinement, reaching the first level of tempered body.</p><p></p><p>The Body Shrinking Technique further enhanced his physical body, reaching the second level of tempered body. Surely after fully mastering the Thundering Fist, his physical strength would be elevated to at least the third level of tempered body!</p><p></p><p>With a body at the third level of tempering, he could withstand basic spells like fireballs and ice arrows.</p><p></p><p>This was the advantage of a body refining cultivator. Against ordinary cultivators of the same level, they had a significant advantage, especially in close combat situations where they were practically invincible at the same level.</p><p></p><p>After a period of practice, Zhou You completed the Thundering Fist for the day. He took out an iron sword and began to sharpen it by the lake.</p><p></p><p>Currently, in Zhou You's imprint, the only living skills he had were [Woodcutting] and [Sharpening].</p><p></p><p>[Woodcutting] only had 6 points of progress, while [Sharpening] already had 22 points of progress, increasing by about 1 point per day.</p><p></p><p>After sharpening for a while, Zhou You hesitated and put down the iron sword, then took out the Yellow Light Sword.</p><p></p><p>The Yellow Light Sword was a low-grade spirit weapon. He didn't know if he could use [Sharpening] on it.</p><p></p><p>So Zhou You began sharpening the Yellow Light Sword.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Zhou You suddenly felt a stir in his heart.</p><p></p><p>[Sharpening (23/100): A rather profound study. Daily sharpening, like a pestle becoming a needle, perseverance will eventually bear fruit!]</p><p></p><p>In his sea of consciousness, a golden light flashed, and an imprint appeared with a line of text, indicating that Zhou You's [Sharpening] progress had increased by 1 point!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You couldn't help but show a hint of joy.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that sharpening a low-grade magic weapon would increase the progress a bit faster.</p><p></p><p>It appeared to be about twice as fast!</p><p></p><p>This made Zhou You feel somewhat delighted.</p><p></p><p>Although the Yellow Light Sword didn't seem to have changed much, the increased speed of progress excited Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, he could quickly bring [Sharpening] to completion and gain some enhancement.</p><p></p><p>So far, Zhou You wasn't clear what enhancement [Sharpening] would bring him.</p><p></p><p>But [Sharpening] was Zhou You's first profound-level skill, so its enhancement definitely wouldn't be bad!</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>As autumn deepened, the cold wind grew chilly, and the fallen leaves by Erhai Lake increased.</p><p></p><p>On the second day, Zhou You found the sword-wielding girl.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Zhou You spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, could you help me with something?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You approached the sword-wielding girl with a sincere expression.</p><p></p><p>The girl was chewing on a piece of unknown demonic beast jerky, staring blankly at the fishing float.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>The sword-wielding girl was stunned for a moment, her gaze somewhat flustered, and she instinctively replied, "O-Okay!"</p><p></p><p>The girl's voice was very clear and pleasant, with a hint of girlish naivety.</p><p></p><p>She secretly put down the jerky she was chewing and hid it beside her.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, she seemed to think it wasn't proper, so she picked up the jerky again and offered it to Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked at the half-eaten jerky, his expression a bit strange. He said, "Um... I'm not hungry, you eat it."</p><p></p><p>"Oh."</p><p></p><p>The sword-wielding girl responded and took the jerky back, then blinked her big eyes at Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked at the girl, thinking about what she had just said.</p><p></p><p>Huh, is it that simple?</p><p></p><p>I haven't even said what it is yet.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked at the girl, not knowing how to start for a moment. She was too agreeable, wasn't she?</p><p></p><p>So the two of them just stared at each other with wide eyes.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He looked at her for a while.</p><p></p><p>It was impossible to expect the young lady to speak first, so Zhou You could only start: "Well...I'm quite interested in array formations. Do you know any relatively simple array formations that, once set up, others can't detect unless they activate it? Preferably with some defensive or offensive capabilities."</p><p></p><p>After hearing Zhou You's words, the young lady tilted her head and thought for a moment, then nodded: "Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's heart leapt with joy: "Can you teach me?"</p><p></p><p>The young lady shook her head vigorously, a bit embarrassed: "I don't know how. Shall I bring you the books tomorrow?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You nodded: "Okay!"</p><p></p><p>The reason Zhou You wanted to learn array formations was not because he was very interested in them.</p><p></p><p>Rather, Zhou You now felt a sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>The only things that could improve his strength in a short time were talisman papers, pills, and array formations.</p><p></p><p>As for talisman papers, with Zhou You's current financial resources, he could hardly afford many talisman papers. Although he had a golden seal to assist him, making his own talismans would definitely increase the success rate. But the problem was that making talismans required a lot of money.</p><p></p><p>With Zhou You's current finances, buying a talisman pen would leave him broke!</p><p></p><p>Refining pills was the same issue.</p><p></p><p>Array formations were different - they didn't require any materials, the cost was relatively much lower, and the short-term strength improvement was significant, so it became Zhou You's best choice for now.</p><p></p><p>After the sword-wielding young lady promised Zhou You, she seemed a bit shy and hurriedly wanted to leave on her sword.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, I still don't know your name."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You asked.</p><p></p><p>After all, she had helped him so much, it would be too weird if he didn't even know her name.</p><p></p><p>The sword-wielding young lady paused in mid-air: "My name is Bai Chi Yu."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, she swiftly flew away, turning into a white rainbow and disappearing.</p><p></p><p>"Bai...Chi...Yu?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was stunned for a moment. "Oh, her surname should be Bai, and her name is Chi Yu. The name is a good name, and the surname is a good surname too, but why does it sound so strange when put together?"</p><p></p><p>Originally, out of courtesy, Zhou You also wanted to teach Bai Chi Yu how to fish for spirit fish.</p><p></p><p>But she ran away so quickly that Zhou You could only give up.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't think too much about it. He returned to his fishing spot, completed his spirit fish task for the day, and then took out his golden light sword to continue polishing it.</p><p></p><p>As the sun set and the moon rose, the autumn wind gradually became drier. Zhou You practiced tirelessly all night without rest.</p><p></p><p>Early the next morning, Bai Chi Yu came riding her sword bright and early. Seeing that Zhou You had not yet come out, she walked to Zhou You's house entrance. Her eyes flickered with hesitation, as if wanting to knock on the door, but then she retreated.</p><p></p><p>After retreating, she originally wanted to leave the array formation book at Zhou You's fishing spot, but for some reason, she turned back again. As she wavered about whether to knock on the door, the room door opened.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You and Bai Chi Yu's eyes met.</p><p></p><p>Bai Chi Yu was still wearing that white Daoist robe, her slender body radiating a girl's youthful energy. The morning glow fell upon her, casting a sacred luminescence.</p><p></p><p>"For you."</p><p></p><p>Bai Chi Yu handed an ancient book to Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You took the ancient book, feeling a trace of lingering warmth from it, and a warmth arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Coming so early just to deliver this book to him, it was very clear that she had kept this matter in mind.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, under normal circumstances, Bai Chi Yu should have come two hours later.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that this socially awkward young lady was still quite sincere at heart.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked down at the ancient book in his hands: Celestial Formations of Antiquity.</p><p></p><p>"?"</p><p></p><p>Celestial Formations of Antiquity?</p>

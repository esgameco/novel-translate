        <h1>Chapter 38</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Illusion, illusory realm..." </p><p></p><p>In his final moments before death, the Taoist priest with the surname Li finally understood everything. He realized that everything he and the fat Taoist priest experienced after approaching the wooden hut was an illusory realm!</p><p></p><p>The appearance of "Elder Meng Xun", the fat Taoist priest being beheaded by a sword, Huang Li showing up, the fat Taoist priest reviving and launching a sneak attack on him, and their battle of spells - it was all fake! </p><p></p><p>Even the wound on his lower back was just an illusion!</p><p></p><p>The fat Taoist priest died, but not by his sword or Huang Li's sword of light. From the blood gushing out of his mouth and nose, and his vacant stare, it was clear his spiritual sense had been extinguished, causing his death!</p><p></p><p>This illusory formation was terrifying!</p><p></p><p>And the culprit behind it all was the young man in coarse linen clothes standing before him!</p><p></p><p>Just who was he?</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest Li wanted to raise his head and strain to see what the youth looked like, but no matter how hard he tried with his last ounce of strength, he could not do it.</p><p></p><p>All the strength had been drained from his body.</p><p></p><p>An intense dizziness assailed his heart, a dizziness he could not resist. His final thought was a tinge of regret.</p><p></p><p>He felt so tired, with no energy left in his body. Endless darkness surged towards him.</p><p></p><p>Unable to struggle any longer, he fell into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest Li collapsed to the ground, his spiritual sense extinguished, blood oozing from his eyes and mouth, devoid of breath.</p><p></p><p>Silence returned before the wooden hut. At this moment, even the youth's figure had vanished.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that even the final scene the Taoist priest Li witnessed was false.</p><p></p><p>No one knows how much time passed before a creaking sound came from the wooden hut's door finally opening. Zhou You emerged slowly, frowning as he looked at the two corpses on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The two corpses died in exactly the same manner - Zhou You had drained their spiritual power using the Small Startling Spirit Formation, then directly extinguished their spiritual senses with a spiritual attack, causing them to die inexplicably.</p><p></p><p>They never even saw Zhou You's face.</p><p></p><p>They did not know who their opponent was.</p><p></p><p>"This Small Startling Spirit Formation is indeed formidable."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was amazed at the power of this ancient formation.</p><p></p><p>The opponent died within the Small Startling Spirit Formation without even seeing his face.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Zhou You only mastered four sets of the Small Startling Spirit Formation, capable of dealing with cultivators below the seventh layer of Qi Refining, including the seventh layer.</p><p></p><p>In theory, the Small Startling Spirit Formation could be stacked infinitely.</p><p></p><p>Ten sets could handle cultivators of the ninth layer of Qi Refining!</p><p></p><p>If there were twenty, thirty, or even forty sets, it should pose no problem against the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if the number was too high, it would not be very cost-effective, which Zhou You did not want to do.</p><p></p><p>"They did indeed find their way here. It seems I must consider my current situation."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked at the two corpses and said with a frown, "That token they were searching for, I have no idea what it is, nor is it of much use to me. If that's what they were looking for, I might as well give it up."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You possessed the Golden Seal of Great Simplicity. In theory, given enough time, he could continue advancing and increasing his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Until eventually becoming a Pill Formation cultivator, or even a Nascent Soul cultivator!</p><p></p><p>It was not an impossible feat.</p><p></p><p>Before becoming a Nascent Soul cultivator, it was best not to make waves and focus solely on cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As it stood, this entire incident revolved around him, which was not what Zhou You wanted to see.</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Zhou You had made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You approached the thin Taoist priest and retrieved a bell from his bosom.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Previously, when these two were trapped in the illusory realm inside the wooden hut, Zhou You saw this person take out this bell. It was very clear that this bell was used to sense a certain object. </p><p></p><p>"This bell is either used to sense that treasure, or to sense what Huang Li used. Regardless of which, to me it is a rather dangerous thing."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You analyzed, crushing the bell in his hand, having already made up his mind secretly.</p><p></p><p>After this matter was over, he would find an opportunity to get rid of that token, transferring the disaster elsewhere. Only then would it be the righteous path.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Zhou You felt uneasy.</p><p></p><p>If this incident hadn't happened today, Zhou You wouldn't have thought much of it. </p><p></p><p>But now that it had occurred, he realized that with his current abilities, the token would only invite more disasters.</p><p></p><p>One could imagine that although the two cultivators from the Righteous Alliance had died by his hand, the Righteous Alliance would definitely learn of their deaths before long. With a little thought, they would realize there was a problem on Zhou You's side.</p><p></p><p>Following the trail, it wouldn't be difficult to discover Zhou You's situation here.</p><p></p><p>By then, more cultivators from the Righteous Alliance would come looking for him.</p><p></p><p>In this way, Zhou You's situation would inevitably be exposed sooner or later.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it would be better to abandon this token of unknown origin and unknown function.</p><p></p><p>He would find a market street and discard the token. If a cultivator picked it up, then the disaster would be shifted elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>"This thing is of no use to me. I have the Golden Seal, I just need to cultivate quietly. Why bother putting myself at the center of a storm for something of unknown origins?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You took out the token and shook his head slightly, having made up his mind to abandon it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he wouldn't go to the market street right away, he still needed to find an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>In any case, the Righteous Alliance wouldn't send a second wave of people for a while.</p><p></p><p>The top priority was to resolve the current situation first.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You picked up the two flying swords and umbrella talisman scattered on the ground and stored them in his qiankun bag.</p><p></p><p>Then he picked up the qiankun bag from the thin cultivator's body. This couldn't be burned - it was a spoil of war, who knew how many good things were inside.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were cultivators from the Righteous Alliance engaged in fraud. Unlike Huang Li who fled, using up everything he had, these two wouldn't have used up all their items.</p><p></p><p>The qiankun bags of these two cultivators from the Righteous Alliance must contain a large quantity of good stuff.</p><p></p><p>After picking up the qiankun bag, Zhou You waved his hand, sending a fireball onto the thin cultivator's body, burning it fiercely.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's fireball technique was extremely powerful, able to incinerate a corpse to ashes in a very short time.</p><p></p><p>Next, Zhou You looked towards the fat cultivator. First he collected the bundle of talisman papers in the fat cultivator's hand.</p><p></p><p>Carefully counting, good gracious, they were all fireball talismans, at least twenty of them!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You inwardly mocked, he was just a fourth level Cultivator of Qi Condensation, was it really necessary to take out so many fireball talismans at once?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You searched the fat cultivator's body thoroughly, and after confirming there was nothing left, he burned the corpse with his fireball technique.</p><p></p><p>After the fireball technique had incinerated both bodies to ashes, Zhou You carefully cleaned up the scene before heading towards Wang Ping's direction.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Wang Ping had appeared together with these two cultivators, so Zhou You naturally had to go resolve Wang Ping's situation.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would definitely cause huge trouble.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhou You did not yet know that the entire Yu Yi Sect had been completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>This is the end of the excerpt translation.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 32</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>[Opening Meridians Manual - Middle Part (10/100): A basic cultivation method. Exhaling and inhaling daily, it takes six days to increase progress by 1. It can be accomplished in one year and eight months!]</p><p></p><p>Words floated up on the golden seal. Seeing these words, Zhou You muttered to himself, "As expected."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a mysterious force surged into his fourth meridian channel. </p><p></p><p>The fourth meridian channel rapidly solidified. In just a moment, Zhou You's fourth meridian was formed.</p><p></p><p>A brilliant golden light burst forth from his right leg, revealing a shimmering golden meridian channel.</p><p></p><p>Thick spiritual power condensed within the fourth meridian channel.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, a large amount of spiritual power flowed out, beginning to cleanse Zhou You's body.</p><p></p><p>With each meridian formed, it would temper his body once, strengthening his physical body once.</p><p></p><p>As his body was cleansed, Zhou You's physical realm drew infinitely closer to the third level of Body Tempering.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Cultivation fourth level!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You clenched his fist, his eyes shining with brilliance, a powerful feeling surging in his heart.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation advancing one more step meant his self-protection abilities grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, having reached the fourth level of Qi Cultivation meant he had no bottlenecks at this minor realm. As long as he had sufficient spiritual power, or in other words, as long as the progress on the golden seal reached a certain threshold, he could smoothly advance to the next level.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he could sell those two Vision of the Moon Pills, earning an extra one hundred spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't know if there were bottlenecks at the major realms, such as when breaking through from the ninth level of Qi Cultivation to the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>However, that was still a ways away, so Zhou You wasn't in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? My spiritual sense also increased by fifty zhang?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You extended his spiritual sense outwards and noticed this point. The range of his spiritual sense had increased by fifty zhang, reaching two hundred zhang. It was only ten zhang away from the spiritual sense strength of the seventh level of Qi Cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Thinking carefully, Zhou You felt relieved. Each time his realm advanced, his spiritual sense strength would correspondingly increase as well.</p><p></p><p>This was normal.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You tidied up, went to the edge of Erhai Lake to wash the dirt off his body, changed into a coarse linen robe, brought along ninety spirit fish, and glanced at the fishing spot for the White Pool Fish. It was already covered in fallen leaves.</p><p></p><p>The White Pool Fish hadn't come for over a month. Zhou You shook his head without thinking too much about it and headed towards Xiao Yueyingzi's small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"In the Middle Part of the Opening Meridians Manual, at just 10 progress points, I've already reached the fourth level of Qi Cultivation. I wonder how many progress points are needed for the fifth level?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You pondered as he walked down the road.</p><p></p><p>Reaching 100 progress points meant fully accomplishing it, implying the early stages were easier while the later stages grew more difficult.</p><p></p><p>10 progress points to advance to the fourth level of Qi Cultivation. Perhaps 40 progress points would be needed to reach the fifth level.</p><p></p><p>As for the sixth level, it would definitely require 100 progress points. But calculated this way, advancing from the fifth to sixth level would need a full 60 progress points.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You temporarily set this matter aside and quickened his pace towards Xiao Yueyingzi's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Zhou You had purchased a lightbody skill called "Clearing Wind Crossing" from the Inner Court, greatly increasing his movement speed. It only took the time to burn one incense stick for him to arrive at Xiao Yueyingzi's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>In the outer courtyard, Zhou You handed the fish over to Xiao Qing, who then gave him the monthly payment Miss Xiao had instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother You, this is what Young Miss instructed me to give you. She said she won't see you this time, and with the current unrest, there may be cultivators from Lincheng infiltrating Mount Taibai, so you don't need to come deliver spirit fish for the next two months."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing said softly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhou You understood the situation was growing increasingly severe, that faint sense of crisis rising in his heart once more.</p><p></p><p>He nodded, "Thank Young Miss for me."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing nodded, hesitated for a moment, and said, "Big Brother You, could you wait here for a bit? After I deliver the spirit fish to Young Miss, there's something I need your help with."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You readily agreed, "Sure, you go ahead. I'll wait here."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing was one who had guided Zhou You onto the path of cultivation, and the two had a very good relationship to begin with.</p><p></p><p>If she had any difficulties, as long as it was within his abilities, he would naturally help.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He would help her take care of it.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Xiao Qing found Zhou You again, and pulled Zhou You to a deserted place, only then looking at Zhou You with a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Xiao Qing remained silent, Zhou You took the initiative to ask, "Xiao Qing, if you have something to say, just say it. If it's within my ability, I will definitely try my best."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing sighed, and then said, "Brother You, do you need someone to take care of you? If so, I can go with you today and take care of your meals and daily life."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhou You couldn't help but be stunned for a moment. </p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing wanted to go with him and take care of him?</p><p></p><p>The implication was that Xiao Qing wanted to follow him, whether as a maid or a concubine, it was up to him to decide.</p><p></p><p>This...</p><p></p><p>Zhou You said, "Xiao Qing, did you encounter some trouble?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing shook her head with pursed lips, "Brother You, don't ask anymore. If you're willing, I can go and ask for the young lady's order now, and from then on, I'll stay by your side. Wherever you go, I'll go. I'll work like an ox or a horse without any hesitation!"</p><p></p><p>After hearing Xiao Qing's words, Zhou You fell silent.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he had a decent relationship with Xiao Qing, and Zhou You was grateful for Xiao Qing's guidance, but it had not risen to the level of romantic feelings between a man and a woman.</p><p></p><p>Especially now, Zhou You had too many secrets, and it was not suitable for an outsider to follow him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the current turbulent situation in Lin Cheng, Zhou You himself was living day to day, and he had no ability to protect Xiao Qing.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that...</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had an even darker speculation, which was... could it be that Xiao Qing was deliberately arranged by Xiao Yue Ying to be by his side?</p><p></p><p>In summary, Zhou You could not agree to Xiao Qing's request.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You said, "Xiao Qing, as you said earlier, it's very dangerous outside now. If you follow me, you'll be living day to day. So I can't agree to your request. If you have any other troubles, I will definitely help you."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing remained silent for a moment, then nodded, "Okay, I understand."</p><p></p><p>With that, Xiao Qing turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Watching Xiao Qing's slender back, Zhou You couldn't help but sigh quietly.</p><p></p><p>On the path of cultivation, one must always be cautious.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You did not linger in the small courtyard and quickly returned to the shore of Erhai Lake.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After returning to the inner courtyard, Xiao Qing quickly went to Xiao Yue Ying's room.</p><p></p><p>Through the screen, Xiao Qing respectfully said, "Young Lady, Zhou You rejected my request."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yue Ying waved her hand, "I know, you can go now."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing left Xiao Yue Ying's room, with a puzzled look on her little face. She didn't understand why the young lady had suggested that she follow Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>After Xiao Qing left, Xiao Yue Ying finally opened her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he realized something?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yue Ying frowned slightly and muttered to herself, "In these past few months, he hasn't attended the public lectures at the Taibai Book Institute, which is rather strange... Never mind, for now, the most important thing is the year-end grand competition. We'll talk about it again after the competition."</p><p></p><p>The reasons why Xiao Yue Ying wanted to arrange for Xiao Qing to be by Zhou You's side were twofold.</p><p></p><p>The first, of course, was to monitor Zhou You. This monitoring had the meaning of surveillance, but also to supervise Zhou You to intensify his cultivation. Xiao Yue Ying noticed that Zhou You's cultivation had not made much progress, so she was a bit worried.</p><p></p><p>After all, Zhou You was Xiao Yue Ying's second choice for forming a Natal Spiritual Embryo. If the attempt failed, she could still pin her hopes on Zhou You, but the prerequisite was that Zhou You's cultivation reached the fourth level of Qi Refining or above.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the higher Zhou You's cultivation, the better.</p><p></p><p>Then, using a secret method, she could deprive Zhou You of his spiritual roots and proceed to the next step.</p><p></p><p>The second reason, naturally, was to use Xiao Qing to tie Zhou You down. Once the two of them were married, Zhou You would be firmly bound, which would put Xiao Yue Ying's mind at ease.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

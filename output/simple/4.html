        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>No matter what, with the assistance of the golden seal [Great Tao of Simplicity], Zhou You was also qualified to embark on the path of cultivation!</p><p></p><p>In this world, cultivation was revered above all else. </p><p></p><p>As long as one embarked on the path of cultivation, it meant that anything was possible.</p><p></p><p>Although he was currently still affiliated with the Xiao family and held the status of a servant, he at least had the possibility of changing his fate.</p><p></p><p>In the past, a mere servant would never have had any chance of leaving the Xiao family.</p><p></p><p>The Xiao family was a great cultivating clan, lacking neither wealth nor money. Even if Zhou You saved up countless silver taels, he would never be able to buy his freedom.</p><p></p><p>He would have remained the Xiao family's servant for life.</p><p></p><p>This mission to fish for spiritual fish carried a certain degree of danger, otherwise Zhao Bin would not have disappeared without a trace. However, if Zhou You did not seize this opportunity, he might never be able to change his destiny!</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Zhou You grasped it, and performed admirably himself.</p><p></p><p>If he did not have spiritual roots, even if Xiao Qing helped him, he would not have been able to obtain this mission, and thus acquire the [Scripture of Meridian Opening]!</p><p></p><p>With the path of cultivation open to him, as long as his cultivation level rose, he would definitely be able to shed his servitude.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Zhou You left the thatched hut and looked up at the full moon in the sky.</p><p></p><p>He quickly estimated the approximate time from the position of the moon.</p><p></p><p>The golden seal [Great Tao of Simplicity] had a limited rate of progress each day.</p><p></p><p>For example, with the [Scripture of Meridian Opening], cultivating for two hours each day would grant 1 point of progress.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the progress, one could continue cultivating, but it seemed the speed would revert to that of an inferior spiritual root, becoming excruciatingly slow.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had already obtained today's progress, and thinking he had no other matters, he decided to continue cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Just as he had guessed, the cultivation speed was excruciatingly slow, perhaps this was the true speed of cultivating with an inferior spiritual root.</p><p></p><p>After half an hour, it should have become the next day, and the cultivation speed increased again, visibly faster.</p><p></p><p>"It should have returned to the initial cultivation speed."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You murmured to himself and continued the breathing exercises according to the [Scripture of Meridian Opening].</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, another two hours passed.</p><p></p><p>Another line of text appeared in the golden seal in his spiritual ocean.</p><p></p><p>[Scripture of Meridian Opening: Introductory Volume (2/100): A foundational cultivation technique, each day of breathing exercises can increase progress by 1 point, complete in 100 days!]</p><p></p><p>The progress increased by another point, just as Zhou You had guessed.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You did not give up, and continued cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Before he knew it, another two hours had passed.</p><p></p><p>The golden seal remained motionless, but his spiritual power had increased slightly.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You gave up directly, no longer wasting time.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, after increasing the progress each day, continuing to cultivate is excruciatingly slow, with a poor cost-effectiveness ratio. It's better to do other things and develop the abilities of the golden seal."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You laughed and couldn't help but say, "I wonder when I'll be able to reach the first level of Qi Condensation?"</p><p></p><p>He felt a slight sense of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the sky began to brighten with the purple qi of dawn.</p><p></p><p>The rising sun shone upon Erhai Lake, its surface rippling with dazzling waves, like an exquisite painting.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You woke up very early, perhaps due to his cultivation, he did not feel tired despite missing two hours of sleep last night, but rather full of energy.</p><p></p><p>After eating a simple meal of dry rations, Zhou You took a hoe and went to the vegetable patch.</p><p></p><p>The vegetables had completely withered and died, no longer usable, so he had to till the soil again and plant new seeds.</p><p></p><p>The earlier the seeds were planted, the earlier the harvest would come.</p><p></p><p>He could not rely solely on dry rations to sustain himself every day.</p><p></p><p>The round trip to the nearest town took nearly a full day.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, being self-sufficient was ideal.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Zhou You had spent years here after being transported to this world, serving as a servant of the Xiao family, so he knew how to till the land.</p><p></p><p>If he had just been transported here as a modern shut-in who had never gotten his hands dirty, he might not have known how to till the fields.</p><p></p><p>He could have starved himself to death.</p><p></p><p>After the entire morning, several plots of land had been tilled and planted with seeds, then watered with water from Erhai Lake. Only then did he feel at ease.</p><p></p><p>Erhai...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The sea was not a real sea, but only a lake, with fresh water inside.</p><p></p><p>[Farming (33/100: A very simple subject, can be mastered in three days!]</p><p></p><p>Another line of words appeared on the golden seal again. </p><p></p><p>Zhou You glanced at it without paying much attention.</p><p></p><p>So in the following three days, except for two hours of cultivation in the morning, Zhou You spent the rest of his time tinkering with the vegetable field.</p><p></p><p>After finishing today's work, another line of words appeared on the golden seal.</p><p></p><p>[Farming (100/100): A very simple subject, already mastered!]</p><p></p><p>Seeing this line, Zhou You was not surprised either, and prepared to go back with the hoe.</p><p></p><p>Next, he should be busy with fishing for spiritual fish.</p><p></p><p>But after taking just two steps, Zhou You found something was amiss. </p><p></p><p>"Eh, it seems my strength has increased a lot?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You said in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, he hurried back to the house, took two wooden barrels, drew two barrels of water from Erhai Lake, and quickly carried them back to the vegetable field.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, he found that his strength seemed to have increased a lot, and even the muscles all over his body had become sturdier.</p><p></p><p>The strength of a normal person is probably around 100 jin, but Zhou You felt he should be able to have 150 jin!</p><p></p><p>What was going on?</p><p></p><p>He could confirm that his strength had only increased just now.</p><p></p><p>It was after [Farming] was mastered that it increased!</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that these seemingly ordinary abilities have some kind of bonus after being mastered?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You said in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>He put down the wooden barrels and carefully recalled what changes he had experienced after mastering [Sweeping].</p><p></p><p>"Spirit! Yes, it was in the spiritual aspect! After mastering [Sweeping], my attention became more focused than before!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's eyes lit up, and he said excitedly, "The spiritual power aspect is quite abstract, so it's not noticeable in daily life, which is why I didn't notice it! Now it seems that this 'The Way of Simplicity' golden seal also has enhancements in various aspects!"</p><p></p><p>If this were true, then it would be another channel for gaining strength.</p><p></p><p>As long as he strived to learn those seemingly ordinary abilities, he could gain certain enhancements!</p><p></p><p>This made Zhou You look forward to it!</p><p></p><p>Those skills in life were not limited to just sweeping and farming.</p><p></p><p>There were also chopping firewood, fetching water, tailoring, cooking, and so on, fishing included.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he had to try more.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>This was already the fifth day since Zhou You came to Erhai Lake.</p><p></p><p>The progress of the 'Opening the Meridians Scripture: First Volume' in the 'The Way of Simplicity' golden seal had reached 5.</p><p></p><p>He finally began to prepare for fishing.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when he was cultivating in the small courtyard of Xiao Yueying, he had heard Zhao Bin say that fishing for spiritual fish was not something just anyone could do.</p><p></p><p>Not only did it require spiritual power, but also some skills.</p><p></p><p>If one didn't have the skills, even a cultivator with extremely powerful spiritual power would find it difficult to catch spiritual fish.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, Zhou You was also a semi-professional angler who rarely missed an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't know whether the skills from his previous life would be useful for spiritual fish, so he could only try first.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You brought his equipment to the shore of Erhai Lake.</p><p></p><p>Since Erhai Lake was vast, with a calm surface and flat terrain along the shore, there were basically no prime fishing spots, and it was more or less the same everywhere, so Zhou You randomly chose a spot and sat down.</p><p></p><p>After all the preparations were done, Zhou You took out the bait and started chumming, then calmed his mind and began angling.</p><p></p><p>Since he didn't understand the preferences of spiritual fish, for now he could only explore.</p><p></p><p>See whether they preferred deep or shallow water.</p><p></p><p>Time passed slowly, and after half an hour, there was still no movement on the lake surface.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You quickly adjusted his strategy, controlling the depth of the bait.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

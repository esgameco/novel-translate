        <h1>Chapter 33</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Zhou You returned to the wooden hut by treading on "Qing Feng Du" after completing the task of angling spiritual fish, and began watering the herbs. </p><p></p><p>As time passed, these herbs grew vigorously, and their growth rate also showed initial signs.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You could not yet confirm whether their growth cycle had been shortened or not, and still needed to observe for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>After taking care of the herb field, Zhou You began to grind his sword.</p><p></p><p>Life returned to tranquility, proceeding in an orderly manner every day - morning cultivation, fishing, then tending to the herb field, and practicing Benlei Quan in the evening.</p><p></p><p>When walking during the day, he would employ Qing Feng Du, to the extent of always practicing.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, he would also take some time to go to the Fish Hut and chat with the fish servants, obtaining some information about Taibai Academy and the temporary city.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p><p></p><p>During this half month, it had been calm with no disturbances. Few people came here, even Bai Chi Yu had not come again, so Zhou You did not have the opportunity to thank her in person.</p><p></p><p>On this day, his Benlei Quan and light skill Qing Feng Du were both perfected!</p><p></p><p>[Benlei Quan (100/100): A relatively complex martial art, practicing for one hour daily, can be mastered in sixty days!]</p><p></p><p>[Qing Feng Du (100/100): A relatively complex martial art, practicing at all times, can be mastered in forty-five days!]</p><p></p><p>As the golden seal glowed, mysterious forces surged into Zhou You's limbs and meridians.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You clearly felt his physical body rapidly strengthening!</p><p></p><p>After half an incense stick's time, he opened his eyes, full of pleasant surprise!</p><p></p><p>With the perfection of Benlei Quan and Qing Feng Du, Zhou You clearly felt his physical body rapidly metamorphosing.</p><p></p><p>The miraculous power from the golden seal swiftly cleansed his physical body and extraordinary meridians, making his body become increasingly vigorous.</p><p></p><p>"Triple Tempering Body!"</p><p></p><p>In just an instant, Zhou You's physical body metamorphosed to the Triple Tempering level.</p><p></p><p>His physical body had previously already reached the peak of the Double Tempering level, only lacking an opportunity to advance to the Triple Tempering level.</p><p></p><p>Now with Benlei Quan and Qing Feng Du perfected, he instantly attained the Triple Tempering level.</p><p></p><p>A large amount of black impurities seeped out from his pores.</p><p></p><p>But this was not the end, the strength of his physical body continued to rise incessantly.</p><p></p><p>Sixty days of uninterrupted practice, two months of sweat and toil, countless punches accumulated, had finally ushered in this metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>So the enhancement of his physical body was only natural.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there were also augmentations from the light skill "Qing Feng Du", although the augmentations were more for speed, there were still some for the physical body to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>With the increase in physical strength, Zhou You felt extremely exhilarated, and once again practiced Benlei Quan.</p><p></p><p>Finally, feeling unsatisfied, he took out an iron sword to practice a set of Shadow Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>It was at this point that the advancement of his physical realm finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Quadruple Tempering Body!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's eyes flashed, very satisfied with this result.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the surging powerful force of his formidable physical body, Zhou You became somewhat excited. He swiftly went outside, taking advantage of the night, made his way into the woods, and saw a tree thicker than a person. He gathered all his internal energy, coupled with Benlei Quan, and struck the large tree fiercely.</p><p></p><p>"Crackâ€”"</p><p></p><p>The large tree made a slight sound, followed by a "boom" of a tremendous noise, toppling to the ground and kicking up countless dust particles.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, this place was rarely visited by people, so no matter what noise Zhou You made, it would not attract anyone to come.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the fallen tree, Zhou You became even more satisfied.</p><p></p><p>"My speed and internal force far exceed cultivators of the same fourth level of Qi Refining, now although I am a fourth level Qi Refining cultivator, I can still defeat even fifth level cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You clenched his fists, full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>As for the "Qing Feng Du" light skill, Zhou You employed it every day while walking, and after mastering it, the augmentation to his speed was extremely significant.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Under Zhou You's full force movement, his speed was not much slower than a cultivator at the fifth layer of Qi refining realm. </p><p></p><p>When running at full speed, he could even leave behind a trail of afterimages.</p><p></p><p>However, what Zhou You did not expect was that the physical body realm could also reach the fourth level.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You came to the shore of Erhai Lake, washing away the dirt on his body while observing the golden seal in his consciousness. </p><p></p><p>The most prominent information on the golden seal was the middle volume of the "Meridian Opening Manual" and the skill "Grinding".</p><p></p><p>[Meridian Opening Manual: Middle Volume (12/100): A basic cultivation manual. Exhaling and inhaling daily, progress increases by 1 every six days. It can be completed in one year and eight months!]</p><p></p><p>[Grinding (72/100): A relatively profound study. Daily grinding, like a pestle turning into a needle, perseverance will eventually bear fruit!]</p><p></p><p>Looking at this information, Zhou You pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>Currently, all the martial arts Zhou You practiced had been perfected, and his physical body realm had also reached the fourth level of Body Refinement. It would be difficult for him to continue improving in the short term.</p><p></p><p>Even if he went to purchase some martial arts manuals to practice, it would still require a lot of time to make progress.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Zhou You could only focus on improving his cultivation base and the "Grinding" skill next.</p><p></p><p>"Grinding" was the first "profound" level skill Zhou You obtained. He could increase its progress by 1 point daily, and it would take only 28 more days to perfect it.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Zhou You cleaned his body, climbed ashore, changed into a coarse linen robe, casually took two spiritual fish he had prepared, and then headed towards the wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>"According to the information I obtained from the Fishermen's Hut these past few days, the turmoil caused by Huang Li has not subsided. The major orthodox forces in Lin City are still hunting down the remnants of the Righteous Qi Alliance. Those remnants, in order to find Huang Li, are hiding in various places in Lin City, truly reaching a degree of desperation."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You analyzed the current situation while leaning against the fish.</p><p></p><p>During this period, although Zhou You had been working on improving his own strength, he was not oblivious to outside events. Every few days, he would go to the Fishermen's Hut and chat with Wang Ping and others.</p><p></p><p>From them, Zhou You learned that the Huang Li incident had not ended.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it gave the impression that the people of the Righteous Qi Alliance were becoming increasingly frantic in their efforts to find Huang Li.</p><p></p><p>This had given Zhou You a lingering sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>This was understandable, though.</p><p></p><p>From Huang Li's death until now, it had only been a little over two months.</p><p></p><p>For cultivators, two months was just the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The incident caused by Huang Li was significant, so it naturally could not be resolved that easily.</p><p></p><p>According to Wang Ping's speculation, for the Huang Li incident to truly pass, either the Righteous Qi Alliance or other forces would have to find him, or five to six years would have to pass before it gradually died down.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that token is more important than I imagined," Zhou You thought silently, further solidifying his determination to become stronger quickly.</p><p></p><p>After eating the grilled fish, Zhou You did not rest, but went to the herb garden.</p><p></p><p>The herbs in the garden had grown well after nearly two months, giving off a faint medicinal fragrance.</p><p></p><p>With his excellent eyesight, Zhou You carefully observed the changes in the herbs again, becoming extremely confident in his previous guess.</p><p></p><p>During this time, he observed the herbs daily and compared them to the descriptions in the book on cultivating herbs. He could confirm that the herbs he planted went through each growth stage several days earlier than others!</p><p></p><p>From this, he could deduce that whether planting herbs or vegetables, Zhou You could shorten their growth cycles.</p><p></p><p>[Author's Note: First, two chapters updated. The rest are still being written, and two more chapters will be updated at 6 PM. I hope everyone continues reading. Also, could someone give me a small donation? Even one yuan would be fine... I haven't received a single donation yet, it's disappointing.]</p>

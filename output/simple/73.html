        <h1>Chapter 73</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Bang bang bang—"</p><p></p><p>Those fireballs one by one slammed into the Kui Wood Demon's protective spiritual qi, causing the shield to tremble unceasingly, as if it could shatter at any moment. </p><p></p><p>"Fire spell? No!"</p><p></p><p>Master Liu initially thought these fireballs were just fire spells from the Small Five Elements Formation, but after careful consideration, he realized it was not so.</p><p></p><p>The fireballs also emitted a dense wood elemental power, obviously not a pure fire spell.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Primordial Green Spiritual Fire!"</p><p></p><p>Master Liu said with a solemn tone: "This guy is actually also a pill refiner?"</p><p></p><p>He found it hard to believe, not understanding what level of cultivation Zhou You had attained to be able to refine the Primordial Green Spiritual Fire.</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan also slightly furrowed his brows, saying in a low voice: "Don't wait any longer, attack together to break the formation and capture him!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Mu Jihan circulated his spiritual power, causing his brocade robe to rustle as it expanded. </p><p></p><p>Streaks of white light burst forth from his body.</p><p></p><p>Then he raised his hand and pointed, shooting out a powerful white beam that instantly struck the Five Elements Shield.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying burst of spiritual force immediately exploded, causing the Five Elements Shield to violently tremble.</p><p></p><p>Next, the Kui Wood Demon's tree branches also launched another attack.</p><p></p><p>Only Master Liu remained stationary, not moving. He was severely injured - his shoulders wounded twice, his lungs pierced. It was already difficult for him to still be alive, so trying to attack again would be delusional.</p><p></p><p>He could only divert all his spiritual power to stabilize his vital signs, otherwise he could perish at any moment.</p><p></p><p>He did not dare assist further.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, several more green fireballs flew out and slammed into the Kui Wood Demon's protective spiritual light.</p><p></p><p>The Kui Wood Demon's protective spiritual light was suddenly shattered!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Master Liu's expression changed slightly, exclaiming: "No! The power of the Primordial Green Spiritual Fire is continuously increasing, each one more powerful than the last!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan also sensed the strangeness of the Primordial Green Spiritual Fire, his face slightly darkening.</p><p></p><p>Gritting his teeth, he waved his hand, sending out a purple-gold flying sword darting rapidly. The purple-gold sword instantly enlarged into a huge blade spanning several zhang, emanating an extremely powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>A lower-grade spirit weapon!</p><p></p><p>This was a spirit weapon that only Spirit Condensation cultivators could wield!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, ordinary Spirit Condensation cultivators could only use top-grade magic treasures, not spirit weapons, even lower-grade ones.</p><p></p><p>Because these were too precious, difficult to refine - a single lower-grade spirit weapon could cost seven or eight thousand spirit stones, or even over ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>Something even Master Liu could not afford to use.</p><p></p><p>"Break!" Mu Jihan roared furiously, controlling the purple-gold greatsword to viciously slash at the Five Elements Shield.</p><p></p><p>But at this critical juncture, the surface of the earth rumbled, rocks congealing and covering the Five Elements Shield.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A tremendous sound erupted as the rocks actually blocked the purple-gold greatsword!</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!" Mu Jihan's expression changed, saying in shock.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, the Small Five Elements Formation is an ancient formidable formation. If the formation flags used are of the highest quality, with our current strength, it may be difficult to break through its defenses!" Master Liu's face looked grim. With his vast experience, he understood the Small Five Elements Formation better than Mu Jihan, realizing its terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>It was an ancient formidable formation!</p><p></p><p>Offense and defense combined, extremely difficult to break!</p><p></p><p>As Master Liu spoke, more green fireballs penetrated through the rock crevices, striking the Kui Wood Demon.</p><p></p><p>The Kui Wood Demon was blasted back, green flames erupting over its body as much of its bark was charred black.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>And right when the last fireball landed on it, the power of the fireball suddenly surged, increasing fivefold compared to the previous fireballs!</p><p></p><p>"Boom——"</p><p></p><p>The fireball instantly expanded, covering the Kui Wood Demon in the blink of an eye. </p><p></p><p>"Owww——"</p><p></p><p>The Kui Wood Demon let out a shrill cry, its roots and branches wildly thrashing about, launching indiscriminate attacks.</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan reacted extremely quickly, a white light emanating from his body, his entire figure flickering unstably as he dodged the attacking roots and branches. In an extremely short time, he moved far away from the Kui Wood Demon.</p><p></p><p>That Master Liu's face also changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Everything happened too fast!</p><p></p><p>How could he have imagined that this Qing Yuan Spiritual Fire would become so terrifying, completely beyond his understanding!</p><p></p><p>As the Kui Wood Demon was burned into madness, launching indiscriminate attacks, Master Liu was also exerting all his effort to evade.</p><p></p><p>But he was already severely injured, his right chest pierced through. Even the slightest movement brought searing pain, causing his figure to stagger, unable to dodge.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Master Liu was struck by the Kui Wood Demon's branch, his entire body flung out, spitting out fresh blood. The spiritual power maintaining his life instantly collapsed as he fell to the ground, coughing out a few more mouthfuls of blood, his eyes becoming dim.</p><p></p><p>He felt some unwillingness as he looked at the scene before him.</p><p></p><p>The Kui Wood Demon was covered in green flames, struggling madly, but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>In just over ten breaths, the Kui Wood Demon fell to the ground, its massive body gradually burning into dead branches.</p><p></p><p>Master Liu never imagined that what he thought was a simple matter would cost him his life!</p><p></p><p>He lay on the ground, feeling his life slipping away, but powerless to do anything.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Mu Jihan looked at the devastated scene, his face darkening to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>His body was slightly trembling, his fists clenched, knuckles white.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Mu Jihan slowly calmed down. He looked towards Zhou You's wooden hut, took a deep breath, and called out loudly, "Junior Brother Zhou, things have reached this point, so I won't beat around the bush. I came here to find you. If you and I cooperate, I can help you break free from servitude!"</p><p></p><p>"I can treat you as an honored guest in Lin'an Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>"With your abilities, and the resources Lin'an Prefecture can provide, even reaching the Yuan Ying realm may not be impossible in the future!"</p><p></p><p>"Consider it."</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan's voice echoed in the vicinity.</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he stood in place, the purple-gold flying sword returning to him, silently waiting for Zhou You's reply.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>What awaited him was still silence.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You acted as if he hadn't heard, not responding with a single word.</p><p></p><p>This caused Mu Jihan's expression to darken further.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, then it will be a fight to the death."</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan's body flickered with white light as he fiercely formed hand seals, causing the purple-gold flying sword to expand dozens of times, becoming like a sky-piercing giant sword.</p><p></p><p>"Wind Thunder Slash!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan roared, arcs of flickering lightning appearing on the giant sword, filled with a destructive aura.</p><p></p><p>"Although I, Mu Jihan, am a son of a minor family in Lin'an, I have outstanding talents and an unyielding mind. I have never relied on Lin'an Prefecture's resources, cultivating through self-reliance for forty years to reach my current achievements!"</p><p></p><p>"I don't believe I can't even deal with a mere servant of the Xiao Family!"</p><p></p><p>With those words, the giant sword transformed into a bolt of lightning, instantly appearing above the Five Elements Shield and Earth Element Technique, pressing down without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>But in that very instant.</p><p></p><p>A powerful spiritual force broke through the barrier and fell upon Mu Jihan!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

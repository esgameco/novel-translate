        <h1>Chapter 30</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, Zhou You's cultivation level was at the third level of Qi Refining, and his physical realm was about to advance to the third level of Body Refinement. His walking speed was much faster than before.</p><p></p><p>In the past, it would take him several hours to walk to the nearby Inner Town thirty miles away. Now, it would take him at most half an hour to get there. </p><p></p><p>First, Zhou You sold 30 spirit fish in the nearest Inner Town, obtaining 60 spirit sands. </p><p></p><p>Then he changed his appearance and went to other Inner Towns, selling 35 spirit fish and obtaining 70 spirit sands.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You repeated this process, selling all the spirit fish until he finally obtained 300 spirit sands. Together with the spirit sands previously held by Xiao Yueyingand Huang Li, he had enough for 500 spirit sands to exchange for five low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You smiled bitterly.</p><p></p><p>It took nearly five months to accumulate so many spirit fish, plus the spirit sands given by Xiao Yueying, just to barely obtain five low-grade spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>This was under the condition that Zhou You could catch five spirit fish per day, and Xiao Yueying was relatively generous.</p><p></p><p>Other fish servants could only catch three spirit fish, and had to hand over at least eighty spirit fish per month. One could imagine how difficult it was for these lower-level cultivators to obtain cultivation resources.</p><p></p><p>After selling all the spirit fish, Zhou You did not stop there.</p><p></p><p>He still had some things to sell.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Moongazing Pills used for advancing levels were worth at least fifty spirit stones each, and Zhou You had four of them.</p><p></p><p>He went around to two Inner Towns and finally managed to sell two of the Moongazing Pills, obtaining 103 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>The reason he only sold two was that Zhou You was not sure if he would encounter a bottleneck when advancing from the third to the fourth level of Qi Refining, so he had to keep two pills in reserve for that purpose.</p><p></p><p>If there was a bottleneck, Zhou You could take the Moongazing Pills to try to break through.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the Moongazing Pills, Zhou You also had three Cultivation Pills given by Xiao Yueying, which he did not dare to consume himself, so he sold them all, obtaining 45 spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>As for the Recovery Pills, Zhou You did not touch a single one, as these were for healing injuries and could save lives in critical moments, so Zhou You had to keep them all.</p><p></p><p>After selling all the "loot", Zhou You obtained a total of 153 low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Adding the 78 spirit stones obtained from killing Huang Li previously, Zhou You now had a total of 231 low-grade spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>For a cultivator at the third level of Qi Refining, this was an absolute fortune.</p><p></p><p>Carrying so many low-grade spirit stones, Zhou You did not feel embarrassed or nervous.</p><p></p><p>He did not waste any time, as his urgent task was to exchange all these low-grade spirit stones for strength to protect himself.</p><p></p><p>So Zhou You did not rest, and headed to another Inner Town.</p><p></p><p>Now Zhou You wanted to keep a low profile. If he could buy the needed items in the Inner Town, he had no need to go to the Market Town.</p><p></p><p>The Market Town had too many cultivators, and too many prying eyes.</p><p></p><p>The items Zhou You lacked were Spiritual Vision Stones, Shocking Soul Wood, and Heart Control Jade, three things needed to set up the Minor Shocking Soul Formation.</p><p></p><p>As for how many spirit stones were required, Zhou You was not clear, he could only try his luck.</p><p></p><p>These three materials were actually mentioned in the Journey to the West.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual Vision Stones were a material used for refining storage bags, while Shocking Soul Wood and Heart Control Jade were used for refining puppets, and were not particularly rare.</p><p></p><p>So it should not be too difficult to find these three materials.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You went to the first Inner Town and spent 50 spirit stones to buy five pieces of Heart Control Jade.</p><p></p><p>As night had fallen, Zhou You found an inn in the Inner Town to stay overnight. The next day, he changed his appearance and went to another Inner Town.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after going through four Inner Towns, he gathered the other two materials.</p><p></p><p>He spent 100 spirit stones to buy five Spiritual Vision Stones, and 60 spirit stones to buy five pieces of Shocking Soul Wood.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Until now, Zhou You only had eleven spirit stones left on his body!</p><p></p><p>These eleven low-grade spirit stones were almost useless for purchasing anything that could enhance his strength, so Zhou You put them away, preparing to use them to operate the Small Shocking Spirit Formation. </p><p></p><p>Since it was a formation, it naturally required spirit stones to operate.</p><p></p><p>After buying the necessary items, Zhou You didn't waste any more time and quickly returned to the wooden hut by Erhai Lake.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown whether it was because the Taibai Academy had become more vigilant recently, or because Zhou You himself was quite cautious, changing his appearance every time he went to a gathering place. In any case, he did not encounter any danger on this outing.</p><p></p><p>Everything went very smoothly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Taibai Academy's increased patrols have been quite effective."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You murmured inwardly. Just as he was about to push open the door and start setting up the Small Shocking Spirit Formation, he noticed a jade slip placed on the shelf beside the door.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was very meticulous and had an intimate understanding of the layout around him. Any change would immediately catch his eye.</p><p></p><p>So he noticed the jade slip on the shelf right away.</p><p></p><p>"Why is there a jade slip here?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You became somewhat wary and picked up the jade slip, hesitating before probing it with his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>In the travel records, he had read about some evil cultivators who used devious methods to attack spiritual senses, placing them within jade slips. If a cultivator curiously investigated, their spiritual sense could be damaged at best, severely injuring their mind and spirit. At worst, they could become an idiot.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Zhou You was quite cautious, fully activating his Spirit Condensing Technique.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Condensing Technique also had the effect of being able to resist some not-too-powerful spiritual sense attacks.</p><p></p><p>After scanning it, Zhou You discovered that the jade slip actually recorded some formation techniques.</p><p></p><p>This surprised him.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually formation techniques?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's spiritual sense sank as he carefully studied them.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he saw clearly that there were four different formations recorded within.</p><p></p><p>One could be set up at the Qi Refining stage, while the other three required the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>"They're somewhat similar to the Small Shocking Spirit Formation and the Small Five Elements Formation, all extremely profound. Could they be...the ancient formations from the 'Celestial Formations of Antiquity'?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was full of astonishment, finding it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>Who had placed this jade slip here?</p><p></p><p>Could it be...Bai Chi Yu?</p><p></p><p>He quickly recalled when he had previously handed over the 'Celestial Formations of Antiquity' to Bai Chi Yu, she had asked if he needed to look at it for a few more days.</p><p></p><p>At the time, Zhou You's answer was "I can only look at two formations."</p><p></p><p>It seemed...Bai Chi Yu had taken this to heart, going back to study the formations in the 'Celestial Formations of Antiquity' herself, and recording them?</p><p></p><p>"It's most likely left behind by Bai Chi Yu."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You held the jade slip, his feelings quite complex.</p><p></p><p>Since coming to this world, this was the first time someone had taken his matters to heart.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked towards Bai Chi Yu's fishing spot, but the sun had already set and he didn't see her figure there.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You shook his head, put away the jade slip, and returned to the wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>The time left for him was not much. He didn't know when the remnants of the Righteous Alliance or other forces would find this place.</p><p></p><p>So he had to quickly set up the Small Shocking Spirit Formation, otherwise it would be very dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You first practiced a set of Thunderbolt Fist, completing today's progress, then took a bath before finally calming down.</p><p></p><p>By this time, night had fallen. He took out all the materials and recalled all the information about the Small Shocking Spirit Formation before beginning to study it.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

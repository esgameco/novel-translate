        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The Great Awakening, Southern Realm. </p><p></p><p>Lincheng City.</p><p></p><p>In a courtyard within the Purple Bamboo Grove of the Taibaik Academy, the morning breeze rustled the bamboo leaves, making a swishing sound. The early morning sunlight filtered through the bamboo grove, casting dappled shadows on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Swish swish swishâ€”"</p><p></p><p>A lean youth of seventeen or eighteen years old, dressed in a coarse linen robe, swept the fallen leaves on the ground with a bamboo broom, gathering them into piles. After finishing, he wiped the sweat from his brow.</p><p></p><p>"The <Sweeping> skill should be fully mastered now, right?" </p><p></p><p>The youth muttered to himself, closing his eyes to carefully sense for a moment.</p><p></p><p>[Sweeping (100/100): This is a very simple skill that can be mastered in two days.]</p><p></p><p>A line of golden text appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The youth's name was Zhou You. A few years ago, he had transmigrated to this world. Now eighteen years old, his status was that of a servant of the Xiao family from the Southern Realm. A few months ago, he followed the Young Miss Xiao Yueying to Lincheng's Taibaik Academy to cultivate, serving her daily needs.</p><p></p><p>As one of the great cultivating clans of the Great Awakening Empire in the Southern Realm, it was natural for the Xiao family's Young Miss to have her own separate courtyard when coming to the remote small town of Lincheng's Taibaik Academy to cultivate, with permission to bring along servant attendants.</p><p></p><p>Lincheng was merely a border town under the jurisdiction of the Southern Realm.</p><p></p><p>And Zhou You was assigned to sweep the outer courtyard.</p><p></p><p>His daily work was to ensure the outer courtyard remained clean and tidy.</p><p></p><p>Two days ago, while sweeping, Zhou You became absentminded and unknowingly cleaned the entire courtyard. Afterwards, a piercing pain shot through his head, almost causing him to pass out.</p><p></p><p>After the pain subsided, he noticed a golden shining imprint had appeared in his mind!</p><p></p><p>The imprint was engraved with the four words "The Way of Utmost Simplicity."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was unclear what that thing was.</p><p></p><p>But in front of the imprint, a line of text appeared:</p><p></p><p>[Sweeping (1/100): This is a very simple skill that can be mastered in two days.]</p><p></p><p>Today, two days later, the Sweeping skill was indeed fully mastered, reaching 100 progress.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You clearly felt that he seemed to have a unique understanding of sweeping.</p><p></p><p>Just by looking at the courtyard, he could deduce where to start sweeping, how to sweep in the most efficient and effortless way.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this was a rather useless ability.</p><p></p><p>Who can't sweep the floor?</p><p></p><p>Can you sweep out flowers or something?</p><p></p><p>"If Sweeping is considered a skill, I wonder if [The Way of Utmost Simplicity] would provide any assistance or bonus for cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>Based on the name, [The Way of Utmost Simplicity] should mean simplifying everything, making it easy to learn.</p><p></p><p>And judging from the Sweeping ability, it did indeed seem to be the case.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary people, even after sweeping for two days, they would never gain any unique understanding.</p><p></p><p>"If only I had a cultivation manual, alas."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You sighed, feeling somewhat helpless.</p><p></p><p>Although he had transmigrated to this world, his status was merely a servant of the Xiao family.</p><p></p><p>The Xiao family was a renowned cultivating clan of the Great Awakening Empire in the Southern Realm. The more prestigious the clan, the harder it was for servants to elevate their status.</p><p></p><p>For a servant to obtain a cultivation manual?</p><p></p><p>That was simply a pipe dream.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, cultivators had to possess a spiritual root.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't know if he had a spiritual root or not.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Awakening Empire, the trend of cultivation was prevalent, with cultivation institutions established everywhere. Anyone who wished to cultivate could enter these institutions and undergo assessments.</p><p></p><p>Those who passed could join the cultivation institutions, learn the ancient secret cultivation arts, and potentially soar like dragons!</p><p></p><p>Even the scions of great clans coveted these secret cultivation arts.</p><p></p><p>And the spiritual root was the paramount criterion in the assessments of the cultivation institutions.</p><p></p><p>But those of servant status did not have this qualification.</p><p></p><p>For a servant like Zhou You, even the most basic cultivation manuals that were not particularly difficult to obtain were almost impossible for him to access.</p><p></p><p>"If it really doesn't work out, I could try obtaining some mundane martial arts manuals and see if this [The Way of Utmost Simplicity] golden imprint has any use!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You thought to himself silently.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>When he had just crossed over initially, Zhou You thought a wonderful world awaited him. </p><p></p><p>As a cultivator of immortality, able to fly through the heavens and travel freely, there was nothing he could not do.</p><p></p><p>As a dimensional traveler himself, he would absolutely be able to make achievements.  </p><p></p><p>But reality gave him a harsh slap in the face.</p><p></p><p>For five years, he had been whiling away the years in the Xiao family, unable to turn things around.</p><p></p><p>As a lowly servant, existing at the very bottom, he had no way to access immortal cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>How could he talk about cultivation?</p><p></p><p>Now that a mysterious golden seal had appeared in his consciousness, Zhou You had to give it a try no matter what.</p><p></p><p>Even if it meant cultivating the martial path!</p><p></p><p>"In the past when I listened to stories, I also heard that some people cultivated the martial path. Perhaps this is a viable route."</p><p></p><p>After Zhou You made up his mind, he didn't dwell on it further. He cleaned up the pile of fallen leaves and stepped back onto the illuminated spot on the ground, returning to his quarters.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two hours passed in the blink of an eye.  </p><p></p><p>Zhou You returned to the outer courtyard again, clearing away the tree leaves that had fallen once more.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly heard the sound of "crashing and banging" coming from the inner courtyard, as if someone was ransacking the place and smashing dishes.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was somewhat puzzled, not knowing why the young miss was so enraged to make such a commotion.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yueying resided in the inner courtyard, and Zhou You, as a male servant, naturally had no right to enter.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Zhou You might not even get to see Xiao Yueying's face all year round.</p><p></p><p>Normally, Xiao Yueying would only stay in the inner courtyard to cultivate. Even when she went out, she would ride her sword, which Zhou You could not see.</p><p></p><p>With nothing to do, Zhou You stopped a passing maid and asked, "Little Qing, what's wrong with the young miss? Why is she so angry?"</p><p></p><p>Little Qing was only sixteen years old, dressed in a light green silk dress. Slender and graceful, with exquisite beauty like a jade carving, she was one of Xiao Yueying's personal maids who had served her for a long time.</p><p></p><p>She also had a decent relationship with Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>Little Qing sighed, "What else could it be? The young miss came to Lincheng for two reasons: one was to cultivate at the Taibai Academy, and the other was the matter with the Lin family."</p><p></p><p>The matter with the Lin family?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had also heard about it.</p><p></p><p>It was said that Xiao Yueying had a marriage agreement with the young master of the Lin family in Lincheng.</p><p></p><p>This Lin family's young master, Lin Feng, was said to have an innate extraordinary body, with excellent aptitude. He was a famous genius in the entire Southern Province, whose cultivation speed far surpassed his peers.</p><p></p><p>But for some reason, five years ago, not only could this Lin family's young master no longer advance in his cultivation, but he had even regressed!</p><p></p><p>After five years, he had become a waste!</p><p></p><p>In contrast, Xiao Yueying had risen to prominence, with a great reputation in the Southern Province. She was already an existence of celestial talent, and even the renowned headmaster of the Taibai Academy personally came to accept her as a direct disciple!</p><p></p><p>Thus, the Xiao family had the idea of breaking off the marriage.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yueying came to Lincheng this time with two purposes.</p><p></p><p>One was naturally to cultivate at the Taibai Academy.</p><p></p><p>The second was to go to the Lin family and break off the marriage.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You asked, "Could it be that the Lin family was unwilling to break off the marriage, which is why the young miss is so angry?"</p><p></p><p>Little Qing shook her head. "I heard it's not like that. Instead, that Lin family's young master was arrogant beyond belief and actually dared to break it off with our young miss! He even said something like 'don't look down on a youth for being poor' and made an agreement with our young miss to settle their grievances at the Taibai Academy a hundred years later!"</p><p></p><p>After hearing Little Qing's words, Zhou You looked puzzled.</p><p></p><p>This plot, why did it seem so familiar?</p><p></p><p>It was just following the typical storyline of a genius youth becoming a waste, the villainous female coming to break off the marriage and humiliate him, the genius youth awakening his cheat ability, and rising up in anger?</p><p></p><p>Did that mean he, Zhou You, was a subordinate of the villain?</p><p></p><p>According to normal logic, the villain's subordinates generally didn't have a good ending...</p><p></p><p>Then Little Qing said, "On top of that, Zhao Bin, who was fishing for spirit fish for our young miss, went missing without a reason not long ago, so the young miss is naturally in a bad mood."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhou You's eyes lit up slightly.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Bin, who was fishing for spirit fish, went missing without a reason?</p><p></p><p>It seemed the opportunity had arrived!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

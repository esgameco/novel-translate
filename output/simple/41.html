        <h1>Chapter 41</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>[Opening Meridians Manual - Middle Part (20/100): A basic cultivation technique. Exhaling and inhaling daily, it takes six days to increase progress by 1. It can be mastered in one year and eight months!]</p><p></p><p>Within his sea of knowledge, golden light flickered as the information of the middle part of the Opening Meridians Manual gradually appeared. </p><p></p><p>Looking at the words on the golden seal, Zhougame's eyes flickered unsteadily.</p><p></p><p>"After taking a Nayuan Pill and cultivating, it's equivalent to cultivating for four days! With three Nayuan Pills, the progress can increase by 2 points."</p><p></p><p>Zhougame's gaze showed some delight.</p><p></p><p>It meant that with the twenty-one Nayuan Pills he had, he could push the progress of the middle part of the Opening Meridians Manual to 34 within twenty-one days!</p><p></p><p>Originally it would take eighty-four days, but now it only needed twenty-one days!</p><p></p><p>A fourfold increase in cultivation speed!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, these were spirit pills used in the middle stage of Qi Refining, and their effects were quite good.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the fifth level of Qi Refining should not be far away.</p><p></p><p>However, if too many spirit pills were consumed, one had to consider the issues of pill poisoning and pill resistance. Pill poisoning required spending more time every day using spiritual power to refine and expel it from the body, while pill resistance could not be resolved.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Zhougame did not have to rely solely on spirit pills.</p><p></p><p>Zhougame exhaled and left the wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Zhougame had many things that could be exchanged for cultivation resources, such as those miscellaneous spirit pills, the fat cultivator's flying sword, and the strange materials of the thin cultivator.</p><p></p><p>They could all be used to exchange for cultivation resources.</p><p></p><p>Especially after experiencing the power of the Minor Shocking Formation, Zhougame became even more expectant.</p><p></p><p>If he had enough materials, he could enhance the power of the Minor Shocking Formation to the ninth level of Qi Refining, which would affect existences at the ninth level of Qi Refining, making it even more formidable.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if he could obtain more materials and push the Minor Shocking Formation to the Foundation Establishment realm, Zhougame's safety would be maximally guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>This was the power of ancient formations.</p><p></p><p>The effects of the Minor Shocking Formation could be stacked almost infinitely. As long as there were enough materials, it was possible to affect even the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhougame did not think about matters of the Foundation Establishment realm for now, as who knew how many materials would be needed.</p><p></p><p>Zhougame had no intention of going to the inner sect or the market to cash in those things, as he had mentioned before that it was best to first upgrade the two flying swords to top-grade magical treasures.</p><p></p><p>A mid-grade magical treasure could only be sold for three hundred spirit stones, while a top-grade magical treasure could fetch at least one thousand spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>And a top-grade magical treasure imbued with the "Keen Edge" property would be even sharper than ordinary top-grade magical treasures. If it were to be sold, it would definitely be worth more than just one thousand low-grade spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>So Zhougame was not in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>After fishing up the spirit fish and tending to the herb garden, he took out the Clear Shadow Sword and began to grind it.</p><p></p><p>It took Zhougame ten days to upgrade the Yellow Light Sword from a low-grade magical treasure to a mid-grade one.</p><p></p><p>After that, no matter how much he ground it, the Yellow Light Sword could not be further upgraded.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the "Keen Edge" property could only increase a magical treasure's grade once.</p><p></p><p>It could not continuously upgrade it.</p><p></p><p>For Zhougame, this was enough.</p><p></p><p>So, Zhougame began grinding the Clear Shadow Sword.</p><p></p><p>After two hours of grinding, the quality of the Clear Shadow Sword had clearly improved slightly, and its sharpness had increased considerably compared to before.</p><p></p><p>Zhougame was not in a hurry and continued grinding.</p><p></p><p>However, not long after, Zhougame's brows furrowed as he glanced in the direction of the horizon, where several sword lights were rapidly approaching.</p><p></p><p>They were still quite far away, but Zhougame's eyesight was good, and he saw them from afar. He quickly put away the Clear Shadow Sword, took out the iron sword, and continued grinding it.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he thought they were just passing Tao White Academy disciples, but soon after, those sword lights unexpectedly headed straight in this direction and eventually landed near Zhougame.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Zhou, you've ground this sword quite sharp!" said the leading person, a broad-shouldered youth in a white robe. It was Zhang Lei from the Enforcement Division of Tao White Academy, who had previously given Zhougame a jade slip.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lei spoke in a refreshing manner. Upon seeing that Zhougame was safe and sound, he unconsciously heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>When Zhougame saw Zhang Lei and the others coming, he was stunned for a moment before standing up.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He said, "Normally I just casually practice my skills, but it's good to have some self-defense abilities in case of an emergency situation!"</p><p></p><p>He paused, then cupped his hands in salutation and said, "Greetings to the venerable elders."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he felt somewhat confused inwardly. What were Zhang Lei and the others doing here? </p><p></p><p>Could it be that they came because of the matter regarding Wang Ping?</p><p></p><p>After Wang Ping's death, the young master of the Lin City Ye Family would definitely find out, since there was a soul imprint.</p><p></p><p>Once the Ye Family's young master learned of Wang Ping's death, he naturally wouldn't just ignore it.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lei said, "Fellow Daoist Zhou, there has been an incident at the Fish Servant Residence. Just now we received a message from the Ye Family's young master. He said his fish servant Wang Ping has died, his soul imprint shattered. So he sent people to the Fish Servant Residence and found that all the fish servants there had become muddled and unable to take care of themselves, clearly the result of some spirit consciousness secret technique."  </p><p></p><p>"Only Wang Ping died and disappeared without a trace, not even a body left behind. We suspect rogue cultivators from the Upright Alliance snuck into the Fish Servant Residence and used spirit consciousness secret techniques on the fish servants. They must have discovered Wang Ping had some connection to Huang Li, or that Wang Ping knew Huang Li's whereabouts, so they took Wang Ping away."</p><p></p><p>"We've come here not only to confirm your safety, but also to ask if you noticed anything unusual about Wang Ping these past few days."</p><p></p><p>When Zhou You heard Zhang Lei's words, he showed a shocked expression. </p><p></p><p>This shock was not feigned, but genuine surprise.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that the two cultivators, the fat one and the thin one, would turn all the fish servants at the residence into imbeciles!</p><p></p><p>Although not all fish servants lived at the residence, there were still seven or eight of them there.</p><p></p><p>For all of them to be struck by misfortune like this, to the point of even alarming the Tao White Academy - it was shocking.</p><p></p><p>After a brief moment of shock, Zhou You shook his head and said, "I did not notice any abnormalities with Wang Ping."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lei sighed, "Alas, Wang Ping most likely had some connection to Huang Li. Otherwise, why would they only take him? If he had been upfront with us earlier, perhaps he could have saved his life."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You also sighed, his expression one of regret.</p><p></p><p>Then Zhou You asked, "Senior Zhang, were any other fish servants struck by misfortune?"</p><p></p><p>Not all fish servants lived at the Fish Servant Residence, many lived alone like Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lei said, "The others are like you, they escaped unharmed."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhou You inwardly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>If the other fish servants had all met with misfortune, leaving only him unaffected, that would have seemed too suspicious.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the fish servants living alone were all fine.</p><p></p><p>"That's good," Zhou You said.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lei nodded, "I'm relieved to see you're okay. Although Wang Ping was taken away, the Upright Alliance has likely obtained information about Huang Li's whereabouts. So this side should be much safer. But we still can't let our guard down. If anything seems amiss, remember to crush that jade talisman I gave you right away."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You cupped his hands, "Thank you for your concern, Senior."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lei let out a cold snort, "Those vile rogue cultivators of the Upright Alliance are truly vicious. One day this Zhang will utterly eradicate them all!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he hurriedly left with the others.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You watched them depart, his gaze flickering. For now, he was safe.</p><p></p><p>By a twist of fate, everyone thought the fat and thin cultivators had taken Wang Ping away.</p><p></p><p>The Upright Alliance had just been here, so the Tao White Academy would certainly increase its defenses.</p><p></p><p>And the Upright Alliance likely wouldn't send anyone else for the time being.</p><p></p><p>They would assume the fat and thin cultivators had found a lead on Huang Li's whereabouts and were pursuing that.</p><p></p><p>So for the short term, Zhou You's location was quite secure.</p><p></p><p>However, if too much time passed, the Upright Alliance would eventually realize something was amiss and that the fat and thin cultivators must have run into trouble.</p><p></p><p>At that point, there may be more problems.</p><p></p><p>So Zhou You still needed to quickly increase his own cultivation as soon as possible, and then carry out the plan he had in mind.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to Cwenlong for the contribution! Seeking support for three more chapters.</p>

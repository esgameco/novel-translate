        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Who's there!" </p><p></p><p>Zhou You shouted coldly, his heart racing, an intense sense of crisis making him feel unwell, even nauseous. </p><p></p><p>He never expected that someone would actually try to harm him!</p><p></p><p>But who could it be? </p><p></p><p>Huang Li?</p><p></p><p>Or Xiao Yue Ying?</p><p></p><p>At the entrance, a figure stood there, seeming somewhat taken aback, clearly not expecting Zhou You to be so cautious, exposing their presence.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhou, you're doing well I hope." </p><p></p><p>A familiar voice rang out, as Huang Li said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of speaking, Huang Li walked towards Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Huang Li's voice, Zhou You couldn't help but hold his breath - this guy really did come looking for him!</p><p></p><p>He immediately extended his divine sense, enveloping the entire small hut.</p><p></p><p>Although Zhou You didn't know why Huang Li had come looking for him, it was clear the other's intentions were not good.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Huang, whatever it is, just say it from over there!"</p><p></p><p>With a "xiu" sound, Zhou You raised his sword pointing at Huang Li, making him pause.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhou You was able to see Huang Li's appearance clearly by the moonlight shining in from outside.</p><p></p><p>Now that Zhou You had reached the third level of Qi cultivation, his vision had greatly improved, giving him night vision ability. Just borrowing the moonlight allowed him to see clearly.</p><p></p><p>He saw that Huang Li currently looked rather disheveled, with obvious wounds on his face and quite a few bloodstains on his body.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he had suffered quite a bit while evading pursuit recently.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhou, what are you doing? We're brothers, there's no need for swords between us, is there?" Huang Li said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You stared at Huang Li with an icy gaze, not saying a word.</p><p></p><p>Huang Li sighed, then said, "I know, there are many rumors about me out there now, but you have to believe that I mean you no ill will. Think about it, for me to come find you in a situation like this, I must trust you, otherwise if you report me, I'll have nowhere to cry!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Li spoke sincerely, afraid Zhou You wouldn't believe him, so he added, "To tell you the truth, the reason I came to find you is because I have an opportunity to give you. I've been lying low in the Zhengqi Sect, but it was actually for a treasure. Now you're the only one I can trust, as long as we team up to obtain that treasure, we'll soar in the cultivation world!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You listened to Huang Li's enticement unmoved, ready to deploy his powers at any moment. "You think I'll believe you?"</p><p></p><p>"Alas, since you don't believe me, as your brother I can only send you on your way."</p><p></p><p>Huang Li sighed again, then his tone filled with killing intent, "You little cultivators, how can you have not a shred of enlightenment? Do you really think you can defy Heaven's will? Today I'll let you know what reality is!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Huang Li raised his right hand, and with a "hu" sound, a ball of flames suddenly burst forth, illuminating the entire hut and revealing Huang Li's ferocious, terrifying face.</p><p></p><p>His killing intent on full display!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's eyes narrowed slightly, but he didn't panic.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Huang Li's true cultivation level was fully exposed - he was not merely a first level Qi cultivator as he appeared, but rather a third level Qi cultivator who could use spells!</p><p></p><p>"Ever since you advanced to the second level of Qi cultivation, I knew your true level. For a fish cultivator with a lower-grade spiritual root to reach the second level in less than two months, you must have a treasure aiding you."</p><p></p><p>Huang Li sneered, "I'm not a vicious person though. As long as you hand over that treasure, I can spare your life!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhou You finally understood why this guy dared to take such a big risk coming to find him.</p><p></p><p>It was clear his cultivation level had long been seen through by Huang Li.</p><p></p><p>In Huang Li's view, Zhou You was just a lower-grade spiritual root fish cultivator. To advance to the second Qi level so quickly while being drained of spiritual power fishing for spirit fish, he must have an extraordinary treasure helping him!</p><p></p><p>Originally, Huang Li had planned to lure Zhou You out of the Taibai Academy before making his move.</p><p></p><p>That way, he would have had enough time to escape.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if Zhou You died inside the Taibai Academy, Xiao Yueying, who mastered the Soul Seal, would find out the news. </p><p></p><p>But Zhou You was too cautious and didn't give him a chance at all.</p><p></p><p>So Huang Li prepared to return to the Zhengqi Alliance first. After improving his cultivation, he would make long-term plans to scheme for the treasures on Zhou You's body.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, not long after he returned, the deeds done by the Zhengqi Alliance were exposed, and he was forced to flee.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't want to give up the treasures on Zhou You's body, so he took the risk to come back, intending to take Zhou You's life and obtain the treasures before escaping.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think of my proposal?" Huang Li said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't speak, only staring coldly at Huang Li. </p><p></p><p>The killing intent in Huang Li's eyes grew stronger. "It seems you won't cry until you see the coffin."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Huang Li waved his hand, and the fireball immediately flew towards Zhou You at an extremely fast speed.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's eyes were grave as he generated wind under his feet, swiftly dodging the fireball's attack.</p><p></p><p>Although Zhou You didn't have any spells, after perfecting his [Angling] skill, his reaction was greatly enhanced. The fireball seemed fast, but in Zhou You's eyes, it was moving slowly.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You could easily dodge the attack.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation level three?"</p><p></p><p>In the instant Zhou You moved, Huang Li saw through Zhou You's current cultivation level. He was not surprised but delighted, excitedly saying, "In just three months, you've advanced from an ordinary person who has never cultivated to the third level of Qi refining cultivation. This treasure is indeed formidable!"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Li laughed wildly, his face full of excitement, rapidly forming hand seals with both hands.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the fireball changed direction and shot towards Zhou You, this time at an even faster speed.</p><p></p><p>That wasn't all. Huang Li flung his right hand wildly, and one fireball after another flew out, instantly surrounding Zhou You with five fireballs chasing him.</p><p></p><p>Facing this situation, Zhou You became exceptionally calm instead.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, five fireballs were encircling and blocking him.</p><p></p><p>If even a spark landed on his body, he would be instantly engulfed in flames!</p><p></p><p>This was the Fire Pellet Technique, with extremely high temperature and destructive power!</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his powerful spiritual force and reaction ability helped Zhou You handle it with ease.</p><p></p><p>Especially the greatly enhanced spiritual force, which allowed Zhou You to remain calm in such a situation!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, for Zhou You's first battle, he might have been too nervous to fight back properly.</p><p></p><p>Being afraid before the battle would undoubtedly lead to defeat!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You wielded an iron sword, dodging between the five fireballs. In a blink of an eye, the entire thatched hut was set ablaze, illuminating half the sky with fire.</p><p></p><p>"You think you can fight me with just an ordinary mortal's broken sword? Today, I'll let you witness what a real magic weapon is!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Li clearly didn't want to waste any more time. He sneered coldly, patting a small bag on his waist, from which a palm-sized sword immediately flew out, looking like a dagger.</p><p></p><p>But as Huang Li infused it with his magic power, the sword instantly expanded, instantly becoming a seven-foot-long sword emitting a yellowish glow!</p><p></p><p>A magic weapon!</p><p></p><p>Obviously, this yellowish sword was a low-grade magic weapon!</p><p></p><p>Although only a low-grade magic weapon, its power was far beyond what Zhou You's iron sword could match.</p><p></p><p>"Now!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's eyes flickered as he finally found the right moment. One of the fireballs was blocking Huang Li's view of him.</p><p></p><p>Then, Zhou You's iron sword suddenly flipped, emitting a dazzling ray of light.</p><p></p><p>Next, Zhou You generated wind under his feet, boosting his speed as he circled around the fireballs and appeared in front of Huang Li in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Humâ€”"</p><p></p><p>The iron sword's cold light flickered, transforming into a beam of light that shot out from Zhou You's hand at an extremely oblique angle.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Light Technique!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

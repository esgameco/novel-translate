        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>When practicing the 'Body Shrinking Technique' reached progress level 10, it became difficult to further improve. Zhou You then turned his attention to that martial arts manual. </p><p></p><p>The manual was called 'Thundering Fist', which was considered a rather formidable boxing style in the mundane world. </p><p></p><p>It was said that when practiced to the pinnacle level, each punch would be as powerful as thunder, with immense might.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You focused on practicing it, and soon mastered it.</p><p></p><p>[Thundering Fist (1/100): A relatively complex martial art. Practicing for one hour daily, it can be mastered in sixty days!]</p><p></p><p>The golden seal flickered, and a line of text appeared.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was somewhat surprised, not expecting the 'Thundering Fist' to have such a decent rating - it was classified as a complex-level martial art.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it required sixty days to fully master.  </p><p></p><p>This was almost on par with the first volume of the 'Meridian Opening Manual'.</p><p></p><p>"After perfecting the 'Thundering Fist', it should be able to enhance my physical realm!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's eyes shone with excitement as he silently began practicing the Thundering Fist.</p><p></p><p>What he wanted was not how formidable the Thundering Fist was in combat, but merely the combat skills and the physical enhancement it would provide upon mastering it.</p><p></p><p>After the Thundering Fist reached its limit, Zhou You began practicing the Fire Talisman Technique.</p><p></p><p>For Zhou You, the Fire Talisman Technique was the most important skill.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, a night passed. Zhou You barely rested that night, spending most of the time practicing the Fire Talisman Technique.</p><p></p><p>After depleting his spiritual power, Zhou You would regulate his breathing to recover it, then continue casting the Fire Talisman Technique.</p><p></p><p>This continued until dawn, with Zhou You not resting at all.</p><p></p><p>For the current Zhou You, at the third level of Qi Cultivation and the first level of Body Tempering, going for ten days or half a month without rest was not an issue.</p><p></p><p>After maxing out the two-day progress of the Fire Talisman Technique, Zhou You finally began his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the 'Meridian Opening Manual' daily was still the most important task.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation was the top priority.</p><p></p><p>Due to the extended time required for casting the Fire Talisman Technique, Zhou You's cultivation time was delayed today. Thus, by mid-morning, he had not yet completed his daily cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Outside, a white rainbow arced across the sky and landed by Erhai Lake, transforming into the Sword-Riding Girl.</p><p></p><p>The Sword-Riding Girl glanced at Zhou You's fishing spot but didn't see him there. After some hesitation, she approached his spot. Seeing his house door closed, she produced a piece of unknown demonic beast meat with a flip of her delicate hand, placed it at his fishing spot, then swiftly returned to her own spot.</p><p></p><p>She then cast her fishing rod, continuing to fish as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>An hour later, Zhou You finally completed his cultivation and walked out of the wooden hut with full spirit, beginning his day's tasks.</p><p></p><p>He first checked on the medicinal herbs in the field, watering them, and only then started fishing for spiritual fish.</p><p></p><p>Upon reaching his fishing spot, he finally noticed the unknown demonic beast meat.</p><p></p><p>This left Zhou You stunned for a moment - where did this demonic beast meat come from?</p><p></p><p>He could sense that the spiritual power in the meat was many times stronger than a first-grade superior spiritual fish, and consuming it would definitely aid his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You pondered briefly, glancing towards the Sword-Riding Girl's direction.</p><p></p><p>The girl had been staring this way but hurriedly averted her gaze when she saw Zhou You looking over, seemingly afraid to make eye contact with him.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had already noticed that the girl seemed to have severe social anxiety.</p><p></p><p>She dared not interact with others.</p><p></p><p>When Zhou You first saw her, she had an unapproachable air, extremely cold. But now that he thought about it carefully, that coldness stemmed from her fear of socializing, which was why she put on an unapproachable front.</p><p></p><p>Understanding this, Zhou You smiled and readily pocketed the demonic beast meat, without going over to disturb the girl.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Zhou You had no intention of approaching her, the girl visibly relaxed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the girl failed to catch any spiritual fish and dejectedly rode her flying sword away.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You paid no mind, instead returning to his hut and taking out the cultivator's travelogue he obtained from Huang Li to learn about the so-called cultivation realm.</p><p></p><p>The Great Qi Kingdom spanned millions of miles, and the most advanced power was that of the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The Great Qi Dynasty was a cultivation dynasty...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Morning, the inner cultivators controlled the imperial court, with numerous cultivators. The current emperor had the cultivation level of the Yuan Ying stage. </p><p></p><p>Besides this, the entire Great Qi Dynasty had ten continents, each with numerous cultivation forces. </p><p></p><p>Like the Temporary City where Zhou You was located, it was under the jurisdiction of the southernmost Southern Continent of the Great Qi Dynasty, while Temporary City itself was in the southwest direction of the Southern Continent, adjacent to the Hundred Thousand Great Mountains of the Demonic Nation.</p><p></p><p>Speaking only of Temporary City, there were the three great cultivating families of Lin, Wu, and Ye, each with a Jie Dan Zhenren (cultivator at the Condensing Pellet Realm), as well as the two major sects of Taixuan Gate and Yulin Mountain Villa, which also had Jie Dan cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The greatest force was the Taibai Academy, the official cultivation force of the Great Qi Dynasty. It was said that an Elder at the Yuan Ying stage presided over it.  </p><p></p><p>Such official cultivation forces like Taibai Academy were established in almost every city throughout the Great Qi Dynasty, dedicated to recruiting ordinary mortals from the Great Qi country to become cultivators, with the future goal of selecting the most outstanding disciples to serve the dynasty.</p><p></p><p>As for the cultivation nations surrounding the Great Qi country, the travel records did not record much or go into detail, only mentioning that to the north was the Great Mu country, to the east the Haixing country, to the south the Zhuque country, and to the west the Demonic Sea, which had no nation, a mixed bag of all kinds of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The travel records were not just travel records, but could be considered an encyclopedia of basic cultivation knowledge.</p><p></p><p>It recorded in great detail some knowledge about cultivating qi and establishing a foundation.</p><p></p><p>From spells to talismans, from prohibitions to formations, from pills to puppets, all were introduced.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You also learned from the travel records what exactly the six talismans in his hands were.</p><p></p><p>Two were Earth Thorn Talismans, two were Fire Pellet Talismans, and two were Cold Wind Talismans.  </p><p></p><p>They were all offensive talismans.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there was also the pill that Xiao Yuying gave him, called the "Pei Yuan Pill", specifically used by cultivators from the first to third levels of Qi Cultivation for their practice.</p><p></p><p>As for the three bottles of pills obtained from Huang Li, the one with only three pills was the Hui Yuan Pill for healing injuries.  </p><p></p><p>There was also another bottle of Pei Yuan Pills, while the last bottle with four pills was the望月丹 (Wangyue Pill), specifically used for advancing levels!</p><p></p><p>What was an advancing level pill?</p><p></p><p>Like advancing from the third level of Qi Cultivation to the fourth level, there was a small bottleneck that was quite troublesome to break through, especially for those with inferior spiritual roots.</p><p></p><p>The existence of advancing level pills was to help overcome such small bottlenecks.</p><p></p><p>However, the Wangyue Pill could only be used in the Qi Cultivation stage, and would have no effect if taken in the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if there will be a bottleneck in my cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You pondered silently. </p><p></p><p>His cultivation relied on the Golden Imprint, which only needed to reach a certain progress to advance levels.</p><p></p><p>However, he had previously been at the third level of Qi Cultivation, where ordinary cultivators rarely had bottlenecks, so it could not be used as a reference. He would have to wait until his progress in the middle volume of the Opening Meridians Manual reached twenty percent to see if he would advance levels.</p><p></p><p>If there was no bottleneck, then these Wangyue Pills could be sold for a tidy profit.</p><p></p><p>One had to know that a single Wangyue Pill required at least fifty spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Selling four of them would fetch two hundred spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>For Zhou You, that would definitely be a considerable fortune.</p><p></p><p>"However, speaking of which, the insights on cultivation in these travel records are still too few, especially regarding body cultivation methods. It seems I still need to attend the monthly public lectures at Taibai Academy."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You took out the jade pendant given to him by Xiao Yuying. "Taibai Academy's public lectures are scheduled for the middle of each month. It will be right after I complete the Body Shrinking Technique, so I can go and take a look."</p><p></p><p>After silently making up his mind, Zhou You roasted and ate the unknown demonic beast meat, surprised to find that his physical body had greatly strengthened, almost reaching the second level of Body Tempering!</p><p></p><p>This made Zhou You somewhat puzzled, secretly wondering just who this Sword-Roaming Girl was.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't dwell on it further. After eating, he continued practicing the Body Shrinking Technique, Thundering Fist, and Fire Pellet Technique.</p><p></p><p>The next morning at dawn, he took one of the Pei Yuan Pills specifically for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was the Pei Yuan Pill obtained from Huang Li, not the one from Xiao Yuying.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You did not dare to casually use Xiao Yuying's Pei Yuan Pill for now.</p><p></p><p>After taking the pill, Zhou You began cultivating.  </p><p></p><p>Two hours later, Zhou You opened his eyes, a trace of spiritual light flickering within, seeming somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>He then picked up the pill bottle and looked at it, as if he had made a certain decision.</p><p></p><p>Hope everyone can keep following the story. Reading it every day is really important to me. Thank you! Requesting a month's pass...</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

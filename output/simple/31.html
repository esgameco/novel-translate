        <h1>Chapter 31</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Setting up the Minor Shocking Spirit Formation is not difficult, the main challenge lies in engraving the formation patterns on the three types of materials. </p><p></p><p>The engraving of these formation patterns requires mastery of spiritual power to the level of pure proficiency. It also requires extremely powerful spiritual awareness to succeed. Otherwise, the success rate is extremely low. </p><p></p><p>If it fails, then that material will be ruined. This is the reason why Zhou You bought five sets at once - to have a certain margin for error.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You took a deep breath and took out a piece of Shocking Soul Wood. It was a strange black piece of wood about ten inches long. The Shocking Soul Wood had the largest volume among the three materials, so engraving the formation patterns on it was relatively simpler. For a beginner, the Shocking Soul Wood was naturally the first choice.</p><p></p><p>"Five chances, let's go."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You held the Restraining Soul Wood in his left hand, and his right hand's fingers were joined together in a sword finger position. The three spiritual channels in his body simultaneously circulated and erupted, and his extremely refined spiritual power converged between his fingertips, then he began engraving on the surface of the Shocking Soul Wood.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had practiced drawing the formation patterns of the Minor Shocking Spirit Formation countless times, so he was extremely familiar with them and did not feel awkward drawing them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, because he often went fishing and tempered his spiritual power, and had previously diligently practiced the Fire Talisman Technique hundreds of times every day, his spiritual power refinement had reached the pinnacle level, granting him unrestrained mastery over his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>It would not be an overstatement to call him the strongest at the third level of the Qi Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, Zhou You's spiritual awareness had already reached the strength of the sixth level of the Qi Refining realm. Thus, on Zhou You's first attempt at engraving the formation patterns, he succeeded!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's fingers emitted a faint green radiance as he slowly moved them across the Shocking Soul Wood. It took the time to burn half a stick of incense before the formation patterns covered the entire piece of Shocking Soul Wood.</p><p></p><p>With this, the engraving on the first piece of Shocking Soul Wood was successful.</p><p></p><p>The first formation pattern was also successfully engraved!</p><p></p><p>[Minor Shocking Spirit Formation (2/100): A rather complex ancient formation technique. Succeeding in one pattern grants 2 progress, failing in one pattern grants 1 progress. Completing three equivalent formations can activate the "Formation Mastery" trait.]</p><p></p><p>Golden light flashed in his consciousness, and a line of text appeared in a golden imprint.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You glanced at it and couldn't help but show a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>From the description of the "Minor Shocking Spirit Formation", completing three equivalent ranked formations could activate the "Formation Mastery" trait.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time the golden imprint had mentioned the word "trait".</p><p></p><p>What exactly did this trait mean?</p><p>Did it have any special effects?</p><p></p><p>Formation Mastery, from the literal meaning, seemed to imply a certain level of insight into formation techniques.</p><p></p><p>But Zhou You felt that things were not that simple.</p><p></p><p>This made Zhou You think of the [Farming] technique. Could it be similar to how after learning [Farming], he could shorten the growth period of vegetables?</p><p></p><p>That was a possibility.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the three formations needed, Zhou You recalled the other two Qi Refining realm formations.</p><p></p><p>One was the Minor Five Phases Formation, and the other was the formation recorded in the jade slip he had just obtained - the Five Ghosts Solemn Killing Formation!</p><p></p><p>These two formations were of equivalent rank to the Minor Shocking Spirit Formation.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that after getting through this crisis, he could try learning these two formations to understand what exactly this "trait" was for.</p><p></p><p>However, for now, the most important thing was to successfully set up the Minor Shocking Spirit Formation first.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You reined in his thoughts and continued engraving the formation patterns.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The autumn wind grew increasingly crisp and refreshing, and the sun set earlier and earlier.</p><p></p><p>Five days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Engraving formation patterns was an extremely draining activity for both spiritual power and stamina, especially for a beginner like Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Zhou You could only engrave three formation patterns each day before running out of spiritual power and feeling utterly drained of energy.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why engraving formation patterns required powerful spiritual awareness - one had to be able to do it.</p><p></p><p>If one's spiritual awareness was too weak, they would be completely exhausted before even finishing a single formation pattern. How could it be done well then?</p><p></p><p>With three types of materials and five sets of each, there were fifteen formation patterns in total. Zhou You only failed three times!</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Success twelve times!</p><p></p><p>Each type of material failed just once. </p><p></p><p>Looking at the twelve sets of materials in front of him, Zhou You also understood that without taking small steps, one cannot travel a thousand miles.</p><p></p><p>That he could achieve such a high success rate in carving array glyphs for the first time, apart from the assistance of the golden seal, was also related to his own dense spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't persisted in fishing every day to temper his spiritual power and cultivate his concentration, he would not have had such a high success rate.</p><p></p><p>[Minor Shocking Array (27/100): A relatively complex ancient array formation. Succeeding in one glyph gives 2 progress points, failing gives 1 progress point. Completing three equivalent array formations can activate the trait "Array Mastery."]</p><p></p><p>Looking at the characters on the golden seal, Zhou You was quite satisfied. </p><p></p><p>But at the same time, he also felt regretful.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the few mainstream occupations in the cultivation world are said to burn money.</p><p></p><p>With the assistance of the golden seal, Zhou You's success rate in carving glyphs was greatly increased. Even before fully learning the Minor Shocking Array, he had spent over two hundred spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the occupations of pill refining and talisman making.</p><p></p><p>It truly costs money.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You also understood that once mastered, these would be of great benefit in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>For example, with this set of Minor Shocking Arrays, he had four sets. If he sold each one, he could get at least two hundred spirit stones per set. Just one set would allow him to break even!</p><p></p><p>Of course, Zhou You could not possibly sell them now.</p><p></p><p>The most formidable aspect of the Minor Shocking Array was that the effects of the array formations could be stacked!</p><p></p><p>In other words, Zhou You's four sets of Minor Shocking Arrays could be laid in one place, greatly increasing their power.</p><p></p><p>With four sets of Minor Shocking Arrays together, they could temporarily trap a seventh level Cultivating Qi cultivator.</p><p></p><p>If there were ten sets, they could trap a ninth level Cultivating Qi cultivator!</p><p></p><p>A third level Cultivating Qi cultivator trapping a ninth level, just thinking about it seemed terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Of course, the premise was that Zhou You had that many sets.</p><p></p><p>At present, even if Zhou You spent all his assets, he could only make four sets.</p><p></p><p>Now with the Minor Shocking Arrays set up together, Zhou You had some ability to protect himself.</p><p></p><p>He took advantage of the night to lay the Minor Shocking Arrays near the wooden hut. After sensing the hidden Minor Shocking Arrays, the taut strings of Zhou You's heart finally relaxed a bit.</p><p></p><p>He only needed a few incantation hand seals to activate the nearby Minor Shocking Arrays.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You returned to the wooden hut, practiced the Thunderbolt Fist set, then increased his progress for the day before starting to rest.</p><p></p><p>These past few days had really exhausted him.</p><p></p><p>Laying array formations was indeed tiring on the mind.</p><p></p><p>Every path of cultivation was not easy.</p><p></p><p>Actually, Zhou You had never come into contact with other array cultivators. If other array cultivators knew he had so easily laid out an array formation, they wouldn't know what to think...</p><p></p><p>In the following days, apart from cultivating and fishing, Zhou You would also practice the Thunderbolt Fist and observe the growth of the medicinal herbs.</p><p></p><p>During this time, he also went to the inner sect to purchase a lightness skill manual.</p><p></p><p>This kind of mortal martial arts secret manual had no use for ordinary cultivators, but for Zhou You it was quite useful. With the golden seal's assistance, most of these martial arts secret manuals could exert their intended effects.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two weeks passed in a flash.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Zhou You was cultivating as usual in the morning. After two hours, he exhaled.</p><p></p><p>"Based on the number of times, the progress of cultivating the 'Opening the Meridians Technique' this time should increase to 10. The fourth meridian channel has become extremely condensed. Could it be that I'm about to break through to the fourth level of Cultivating Qi?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You observed his own condition and sensed that the fourth meridian channel was becoming more and more condensed. He guessed that his cultivation level was about to make a breakthrough to the fourth level of Cultivating Qi.</p><p></p><p>This was different from his initial guess that the progress would need to reach 20 before advancing to the fourth level of Cultivating Qi. He didn't expect it would only take a progress of 10.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow there will be four more chapters updated. I hope everyone can come read them tomorrow. Tomorrow's readership is especially, especially important to me as it relates to whether this book can advance in the rankings. Thank you everyone!</p>

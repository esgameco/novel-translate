        <h1>Chapter 55</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Zhou, you really are diligent, eh? Congratulations on successfully opening your meridians and entering the first level of qi cultivation." </p><p></p><p>After the long rainbow in the sky fell to the ground, it transformed into Zhang Lei. He looked towards Zhou You, who was chopping firewood, and couldn't help but feel a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Zhou You's cultivation base was controlled at the first level of qi cultivation, so Zhang Lei could see Zhou You's cultivation level at a glance.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You put down his axe, and upon seeing it was Zhang Lei, he cupped his fist in salutation, saying, "Greetings, Senior Immortal."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lei immediately returned the salutation and said forthrightly, "Since Fellow Daoist Zhou has already joined the ranks of cultivation, we can address each other as Daoists. There's no need to call me Senior Immortal - I'm just an ordinary person in white robes."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had interacted with Zhang Lei a few times and knew this person was open-minded and didn't fuss over minor details.</p><p></p><p>So after Zhang Lei insisted, he changed how he addressed him.</p><p></p><p>"Please have a seat, Daoist Zhang."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You extended his hand politely, guiding Zhang Lei to sit on the stone bench in front of the house, and then poured him a cup of water.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Zhang Lei took out a jade slip from his storage pouch. "I was just passing by in a hurry today and didn't have time to prepare a gift. This jade slip contains my experiences from the qi cultivation stage. It should be helpful for Fellow Daoist Zhou."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was stunned for a moment, then accepted the jade slip and cupped his fist in thanks, "Many thanks, Daoist Zhang."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lei smiled, "Although you haven't yet developed a spiritual sense at the first level of qi cultivation, if you place the jade slip against your brow and channel your spiritual energy, you'll be able to see its contents."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You nodded and asked, "May I ask what brings Daoist Zhang here?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lei's expression turned somewhat grave as he put away his smile. "Recently, many demonic beasts have appeared within the region. I've come mainly to warn Fellow Daoist to be extremely careful."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's heart stirred. So the rumors were true.</p><p></p><p>The mudfish demonic beast he had slain before must have escaped into Lake Erhai.</p><p></p><p>Outwardly, Zhou You showed an anxious expression. "This...I thought it was just a rumor, I never imagined it was real! Why would demonic beasts appear in this region?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lei said, "At first, I thought it was just a rumor too. But half a month ago, when I went to investigate near Luoshui Pass, I did indeed encounter demonic beasts. Although they were just low-level demonic beasts, we still can't let our guard down."</p><p></p><p>He paused, then continued, "As for the reason, I'm still investigating."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You cupped his fist, "Thank you for the warning!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lei waved his hand, indicating it was no big deal, and then said, "This place is still quite far from the Taibai Academy. I'm worried demonic beasts may come here, so why don't you move closer to the academy? If there's any danger, it'll be easier for the disciples to assist you."</p><p></p><p>These words were truly sincere, without any pretense.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You understood that Zhang Lei was an open person who had shown concern for his safety multiple times, even giving him a life-protecting jade slip.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You still politely declined Zhang Lei's suggestion, "Thank you, Daoist, but this place is very far from Luoshui Pass. It's unlikely demonic beasts would appear here, so I won't trouble you."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the determination in Zhou You's eyes, Zhang Lei didn't say much more.</p><p></p><p>After chatting idly for a while longer, he glanced at the pile of firewood beside them and remarked, "Fellow Daoist Zhou, for us cultivators, cultivation is paramount - our cultivation base is the root of everything. Be careful not to neglect your practice due to external matters."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's eyes flickered as he looked at the firewood and the nearby herb garden, realizing Zhang Lei was giving him frank advice. He cupped his fist and said, "Thank you for the reminder, Daoist. I understand."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lei gave an affirmative nod, then rode his sword away.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You watched Zhang Lei's departing figure, inwardly remembering his goodwill.</p><p></p><p>Only after Zhang Lei had completely left did Zhou You look towards the forest.</p><p></p><p>"Come out."</p><p></p><p>With his keen spiritual perception and strong insight, Zhou You had detected movement in the forest long ago and guessed it must be Bai Chi Yu.</p><p></p><p>Bai Chi Yu seemed to dislike interacting with others.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Whether someone came or she came when others were present, she would avoid being seen. </p><p></p><p>Zhou You also understood that this girl was simply unwilling to interact with strangers.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough.</p><p></p><p>A figure in white emerged from the forest. </p><p></p><p>The sunlight shone on Bai Chi Yu's graceful figure, making her appear ethereal and elegant.</p><p></p><p>Since this October, Bai Chi Yu would come fishing from time to time, and her relationship with Zhou You was actually quite good.</p><p></p><p>"For you."</p><p></p><p>Bai Chi Yu walked over and handed Zhou You a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked puzzled: "What's this for?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Chi Yu tilted her chin: "You made the plan, I killed people, the reward is split evenly, fair!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was a bit speechless, but he didn't say anything further and accepted the storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Just a month ago, the conflict between Taibai Academy and the Zhengqi Alliance had escalated, so Taibai Academy issued a wanted list targeting members of the Zhengqi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The more Zhengqi cultivators killed, the higher the score.</p><p></p><p>According to Bai Chi Yu, this wanted list would be one of the events for the year-end grand competition.</p><p></p><p>For this reason, Bai Chi Yu had also been working hard to track down the whereabouts of Zhengqi cultivators, but due to her personality, she didn't dare interact with others, resulting in her only luckily encountering one Zhengqi cultivator in ten days and killing him.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that her combat record was at the bottom.</p><p></p><p>Once, feeling dejected, she came to Zhou You and told him about her troubles.</p><p></p><p>So Zhou You helped her come up with a plan.</p><p></p><p>He told her to buy a ninth-level cultivation puppet, then design and dress it up, and affix it with a top-grade Illusion Talisman to make it look like Lin Feng.</p><p></p><p>Then, spread word in the city that Lin Feng was lurking in a certain area, and Bai Chi Yu only needed to hide and wait for Zhengqi cultivators to take the bait.</p><p></p><p>At first, Bai Chi Yu didn't understand Zhou You's plan.</p><p></p><p>Later, she realized it was really effective.</p><p></p><p>Many Zhengqi cultivators wanted to kill "Lin Feng" for the reward.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, many Zhengqi cultivators were lured out to try to kill "Lin Feng," only to be killed by Bai Chi Yu instead.</p><p></p><p>Since Bai Chi Yu kept it well hidden, those Zhengqi cultivators who were lured out all died by her sword.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the false identity of "Lin Feng" was never exposed.</p><p></p><p>Using this trick, her ranking on the wanted list steadily rose.</p><p></p><p>Today happened to be the day the wanted list was updated, and Bai Chi Yu obtained the number one spot, so she brought the reward to Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou You, I want to eat fish."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, start a fire," Zhou You replied, going to the lake to prepare the spirit fish.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, two spirit fish were roasted, and Zhou You and Bai Chi Yu each ate one.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't care about appearances and ate messily, while Bai Chi Yu tore off small pieces and ate quietly, not speaking while eating. In the end, she ate the entire fish very cleanly, as if she had a special feeling toward food.</p><p></p><p>After eating, Bai Chi Yu finally said seriously: "Zhou You, you helped me get the number one spot on the wanted list. Is there anything you want to learn? I can help you steal it."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You glanced at Bai Chi Yu, thinking that she still wanted to keep stealing? If Taibai Academy found out he was instigating their most outstanding disciple to steal from them, they would definitely crush his bones to dust.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You pointed to the storage bag next to him: "This is enough."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Bai Chi Yu thought for a moment and said, "Recently, the academy issued another wanted list for killing demonic beasts."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

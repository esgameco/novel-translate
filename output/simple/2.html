        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>For any cultivator student at the Taibai Academy, they must complete the academy's tasks on a regular and quota basis. </p><p></p><p>These tasks are equivalent to homework at schools on Earth.</p><p></p><p>The tasks are very diverse, including fishing for spirit fish, planting spirit rice, raising spirit beasts, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Even Xiao Yuying, the talented daughter of a major clan, is no exception. </p><p></p><p>However, as the saying goes, "For every policy from the top, there is a countermeasure from the bottom."</p><p></p><p>For cultivators from major clans like Xiao Yuying, time is the most precious resource. Naturally, they would not waste time on these tedious minor tasks.</p><p></p><p>Thus, almost every clan cultivator would bring some servants into the academy after enrolling. </p><p></p><p>In addition to taking care of their daily lives, some servants would be entrusted with important tasks, such as completing these academy assignments.</p><p></p><p>Unlike planting spirit rice, fishing for spirit fish not only requires certain techniques but also necessitates the cultivator to have developed a certain amount of spiritual power within their body.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the servants responsible for fishing spirit fish would generally be bestowed with simple cultivation techniques. After cultivating a trace of spiritual power, they would then go to the 800-mile Erhai Lake to fish for spirit fish.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Zhao Bin had been responsible for fishing spirit fish for the Xiao family.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You could remember that ever since this guy got this task, his status among the Xiao family's servants rose significantly. He walked around like he was carrying his head, and everyone had to flatter him.</p><p></p><p>Practicing cultivation techniques meant the possibility of soaring to great heights.</p><p></p><p>Although still a servant of the Xiao family, his status was far beyond that of an ordinary servant.</p><p></p><p>And now that Zhao Bin had gone missing for no reason, wasn't this an opportunity?</p><p></p><p>If Zhou You could get this task, he would be able to obtain cultivation techniques. Even the most basic techniques would be a good starting point!</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Bin has actually gone missing? That's quite troublesome, you know. Although fishing for spirit fish is not a major task, it can't be ignored either. But it would be a waste of resources to have a senior cultivator from the clan handle it."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You pretended to be hesitant as he said this.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing sighed, "Yes, it's quite troublesome. Anyway, I need to go attend to the young lady first!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Xiao Qing turned and entered the inner courtyard.</p><p></p><p>After seeing Xiao Qing leave, Zhou You quickly returned to his thatched hut.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Zhou You rummaged through his belongings and gathered eight taels of silver.</p><p></p><p>This was almost all his savings over the years!</p><p></p><p>Looking at the silver, he felt reluctant to part with it. He had originally intended to use it to purchase martial arts manuals. But with the opportunity to obtain cultivation techniques before him, Zhou You had to take a gamble!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At noon, the inner courtyard became quiet, suggesting that the young lady had vented her anger.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You waited in the outer courtyard.</p><p></p><p>He was well aware that the reason Xiao Qing was willing to tell him these things was simply to convey one message:</p><p></p><p>Someone needed to be selected for the task of fishing for spirit fish.</p><p></p><p>And all the servants attending to Xiao Yuying had this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>It was a hint that Zhou You could also compete for it!</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing could not say this openly, so he could only hint at Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Zhou You understood, which is why he came with the silver.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, he saw Xiao Qing and directly stated his intention.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing smiled warmly and symbolically took one tael of silver. "Zhou You, you've helped me a lot over the years. I can mention this to the young lady, but whether you succeed or not ultimately depends on you."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You understood, of course, and was very grateful to Xiao Qing.</p><p></p><p>After all, taking only one tael of silver was just a symbolic gesture.</p><p></p><p>All Xiao Qing could do was recommend him; he had no decision-making power.</p><p></p><p>In the end, there would be a test. If Zhou You didn't have spiritual roots, it would be pointless no matter what was said.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, Xiao Qing told Zhou You to wait for news, which should come within the next two days.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, in the afternoon, Xiao Qing came to notify Zhou You to wait in the outer courtyard.</p><p></p><p>When Zhou You arrived at the outer courtyard, he found that several experienced servants were already waiting.</p><p></p><p>No one spoke, as they were in a competitive relationship.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He was glad they didn't look at each other with disdain.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Xiao Qing brought a few yellow talisman papers to everyone. </p><p></p><p>"These are spirit root testing talismans. Stick them on your foreheads to test if you have any spirit roots, and the one with the best spirit roots will be selected."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing distributed the spirit root testing talismans to Zhou You and the others one by one.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You also felt a little nervous inwardly, sticking the talisman on his brow center. </p><p></p><p>He only felt a burning sensation spreading from his brow center, then soon after the talisman emitted a faint green glow.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the talisman turned to ashes and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't know clearly if he had spirit roots or not, so he looked towards the others involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>He saw that the talismans on the others' foreheads remained motionless, without any glow at all.</p><p></p><p>The others became even more perplexed.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou You has lower-grade spirit roots. Take this object and go to Erhai Lake. Submit a hundred spirit fish every month, otherwise your qualification will be revoked and your cultivation will be abolished."</p><p></p><p>A clear, cold voice of a young lady resounded within the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Then, a green beam of light swiftly flew in front of Zhou You and slowly hovered there.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked and saw it was a bamboo slip.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Brother You!" Xiao Qing said with some excitement.</p><p></p><p>Those servants, seeing this scene, were full of envy, but could only hurriedly say words like "Congratulations" to Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had gained the young lady's approval and obtained the task of fishing for spirit fish. From then on among these servants, Zhou You could be considered soaring to success!</p><p></p><p>He even had the chance to be promoted to become a family servant in the future!</p><p></p><p>Although family servants were still part of the Xiao family, they were no longer slaves. Apart from having to serve the Xiao family, they could gain greater freedom!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You held the bamboo slip and respectfully bowed towards the inner courtyard: "Thank you for your recognition, young lady. I will definitely not let you down!"</p><p></p><p>No sound came from the inner courtyard, clearly indicating that whether Zhou You could complete the task or not didn't matter to Xiao Yue Ying.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't complete it, she could just find someone else.</p><p></p><p>After all, Zhou You was only a servant of the Xiao family.</p><p></p><p>Next, Zhou You responded one by one to the congratulations from the others, then excitedly returned to his thatched hut.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the hut, Zhou You didn't rush to check the bamboo slip. Instead, he brought some silver money to purchase roast chicken and rouge powder from the inner market of Taibai Academy.</p><p></p><p>Taibai Academy was the largest cultivation academy in Lincheng, quite famous throughout the entire Southern Territory. Its grounds spanned thousands of miles, with an inner market every few dozen miles.</p><p></p><p>Both ordinary people and cultivators could purchase goods at the inner markets.</p><p></p><p>Since Xiao Qing was Xiao Yue Ying's personal maidservant, she usually had to stay near Xiao Yue Ying's boudoir and couldn't easily go out, which was why Zhou You brought the roast chicken back.</p><p></p><p>After waiting a while in the outer courtyard, he finally saw Xiao Qing and passed her the roast chicken and rouge powder.</p><p></p><p>"It's my favorite roast chicken! Brother You, you're so thoughtful!" Xiao Qing took the oiled paper package, smiling with her eyes curved like crescents.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You smiled: "I wouldn't have gotten this task without your help this time."</p><p></p><p>After chatting with Xiao Qing for a bit, she reluctantly parted from Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>"Brother You, remember to come back and visit often when you're at Erhai Lake."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing called out.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You smiled and promised he would return frequently.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Zhou You got up early, swept the outer courtyard clean, then took the fishing rod he bought from the inner market and headed towards Erhai Lake.</p><p></p><p>Erhai Lake was still dozens of miles away from the Purple Bamboo Forest, no short distance for an ordinary person. Zhou You had to hurry.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 59</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, sometimes it's not wrong to go out for a walk.</p><p></p><p>The outside world is colorful and diverse. Although he had learned about this cultivation world through travel journals and the books brought by Bai Chi Yu, it was ultimately not as wonderful as seeing it himself. </p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You also understood that with his current cultivation base of only the 6th level of Qi refining, unable even to fly on a sword, it would be difficult to establish himself in the dog-eat-dog cultivation world. To experience the colorful cultivation world, he still needed powerful strength.</p><p></p><p>It's better to keep a low profile. After listening to the lecture, he'll return and intensify his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You put aside his wandering thoughts, becoming more determined in his pursuit of the Dao. Step by step, he headed towards Taibai Academy.</p><p></p><p>This inner courtyard was very close to the main gate of Taibai Academy. Zhou You only took the time of burning an incense stick before arriving at the academy's gate.</p><p></p><p>An enormous white jade archway stood in front of the ancient road in the mountains, inscribed with the four ancient characters "Taibai Academy."</p><p></p><p>On it were carved reliefs of celestial cranes, wondrous flowers and strange beasts. Most eye-catching was the dot on the character "book" - it was an exceedingly sharp long sword, and just looking at it made one feel boundless sword energy surging forth.</p><p></p><p>Behind the archway seemed to be an endless ancient mountain road. The surrounding cliffs were precipitous, with bottomless chasms thousands of feet deep. Further up, everything was shrouded in a celestial mist, obscuring the full view, though one could vaguely make out jade towers and palaces, like a mirage over the sea.</p><p></p><p>This entire immortal mountain was called Cang Mountain, stretching for hundreds of miles. It was where the main gate of Taibai Academy was located, enveloped by an extremely powerful mountain-protecting formation that outsiders could not enter.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You walked up to the archway and could see the shimmering light curtain. After a moment's hesitation, he stepped through, passing the great formation to stand before the archway.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, with the jade token, this formation would not hinder Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>"What a rich spiritual energy!"</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy here was at least four or five times denser than where he lived!</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if cultivating in such a spiritually rich place could increase his cultivation speed.</p><p></p><p>He had to quickly raise his cultivation base to the Foundation Establishment stage, leave the Xiao family, and seek another spiritual land!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You took a deep breath, hung the jade token on his waist, and climbed up the ancient road towards the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>With Zhou You's current physical strength, it was not difficult to climb up to Taibai Academy, only taking half an hour.</p><p></p><p>During this time, there were also many cultivators at the 1st and 2nd levels of Qi refining, walking step-by-step up from the bottom.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You reached the end of the ancient road and arrived at a white jade plaza. </p><p></p><p>The plaza was vast, with mist shrouding the surroundings. One could vaguely see the shadows of various buildings, but not clearly.</p><p></p><p>Behind the plaza stood an immortal mountain, with swirling clouds and mist. Celestial cranes occasionally flew by, presenting a serene scene.</p><p></p><p>It turned out this plaza was only located at the midpoint of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>However, this was the public lecture ground.</p><p></p><p>There were already many Taibai disciples waiting in the plaza, which was densely filled with reed mats, at least a thousand of them. In the center was an enormous high platform.</p><p></p><p>Some people sat on the mats, but more crowded around the two huge white stones at the entrance, pointing and discussing.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You paused for a moment, looking towards those white stones.</p><p></p><p>The two huge stones stood at the plaza entrance like warning signs, alerting all cultivators.</p><p></p><p>One could see densely packed names flickering up and down on their surfaces.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic Cultivator Bounty List! Demon Beast Bounty List!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's eyes flashed as he immediately understood what these stones were.</p><p></p><p>They were the two bounty lists that Bai Chi Yu had mentioned.</p><p></p><p>At the top of the Demonic Cultivator Bounty was Bai Chi Yu himself.  </p><p></p><p>Second was Lin Feng.</p><p></p><p>Fourth was occupied by Xiao Yue Ying. </p><p></p><p>The tenth position was also a familiar name, Zhang Lei.</p><p></p><p>As for the Demon Beast Bounty, the top was Lin Feng, with Bai Chi Yu in fifth place, lower than Xiao Yue Ying's third.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Zhang Lei was second on the Demon Beast Bounty.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't recognize the other names.</p><p></p><p>"Hey junior brother, are you also a recent addition to the academy? I've really never seen you before."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a young man dressed in a brocade robe next to him said with some surprise:</p><p></p><p>The young man looked a year or two older than Zhou You, around twenty years old. He had a jade-like face, thick eyebrows and bright eyes. An jade ornament hung from his waist sash, indicating he was from a wealthy family. </p><p></p><p>However, his cultivation level was not high, only at the second level of Qi refining. Of course, it was slightly higher than what Zhou You had revealed.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You nodded, "Yeah, they were recruited later."</p><p></p><p>Half a year ago, Taibai Academy had recruited a batch of new disciples. This person was probably one of them. </p><p></p><p>However, this person's age was quite old for starting cultivation. Generally, the earlier one starts cultivating, the better. For someone to join Taibai Academy at twenty years old was quite rare.</p><p></p><p>"My humble name is Mu Jihan. May I ask the master's respected surname and name?"</p><p></p><p>The young man in brocade cupped his hands politely. His every move exuded proper etiquette.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this person's courtesy name, Zhou You couldn't help raising his eyebrows in surprise inwardly. </p><p></p><p>The Mu surname belonged to the great Qi nation. Only those related to the royal family could use this surname.</p><p></p><p>It seemed Mu Jihan's background was not simple, possibly the son of a prince or duke.</p><p></p><p>As if guessing Zhou You's thoughts, Mu Jihan explained, "My father is the Marquis of Lin'an."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You then realized. The Marquis of Lin'an was part of the royal family, but because his ancestors lacked spiritual roots and his mother was not favored, he was enfeoffed to Lincheng and became a marquis among commoners, a hereditary title that enjoyed great wealth and status despite being unable to cultivate immortality.</p><p></p><p>Such cases had occurred throughout the dynasties of the great Qi empire.</p><p></p><p>"So you are the young marquis. I am Zhou You."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You cupped his hands in return.</p><p></p><p>"So you are Master Zhou."</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan smiled, then glanced at the two bounty boards standing upright. "Our cultivation levels are still low, but I believe as long as we work hard, we will eventually make it onto these boards."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, someday we will also become the most dazzling talents of Taibai Academy, like Senior Brother Lin and Senior Sister Bai!" </p><p></p><p>A skinny youth with dark skin at the first level of Qi refining said while looking up. "Master Zhou, my name is Wang Tiezhu from Wang Family Village. Please take care of me in the future."</p><p></p><p>Wang Tiezhu wore the white robe of Taibai Academy. His dark yellow skin indicated malnutrition, but his eyes were very clear.</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan glanced at Wang Tiezhu without a word, but stepped back slightly to keep some distance from him.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You noticed this but didn't say anything, only politely cupping his hands in return, "We'll take care of each other."</p><p></p><p>Wang Tiezhu looked at the two bounty boards, his eyes flickering with admiration. "Senior Brother Lin is truly a role model. To eliminate the evil cultivators of the Zhengqi Alliance, he did not hesitate to use himself as bait to lure out many of their evil cultivators, removing the harm from Lincheng."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhou You's expression became strange.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Bai Chiyu's use of the "Lin Feng" puppet to lure out Zhengqi Alliance cultivators had been mistaken as Lin Feng's own doing.</p><p></p><p>Lin Feng had inexplicably taken the blame again.</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan said indifferently, "But I've heard that Lin Feng's methods angered the Zhengqi Alliance, so they somehow obtained many demonic beasts to wreak havoc."</p><p></p><p>Wang Tiezhu smiled, "Master Mu, do you think those demonic beasts wouldn't have appeared in our territory if Senior Brother Lin hadn't lured and killed those Zhengqi Alliance cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan frowned, unable to respond.</p><p></p><p>Wang Tiezhu continued, "Senior Brother Lin is so righteous. First finding the Taibai Sword Bone, then luring the Zhengqi Alliance cultivators, making him their prime target now. Next time they try to assassinate Senior Brother Lin, they may even send Zhuandan cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhou You subconsciously touched his nose.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

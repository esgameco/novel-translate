        <h1>Chapter 65</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Zhou You recalled the first time he came to listen to the lecture, when Wang Tiezhu appeared, Mu Jihan unhesitatingly took two steps back, keeping a certain distance from Wang Tiezhu. </p><p></p><p>It was evident that Mu Jihan really disliked Wang Tiezhu.</p><p></p><p>But now, the two were sitting together very harmoniously. </p><p></p><p>There must be some unspeakable secret between them.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it's also possible that Mu Jihan was rather opportunistic, looking down on Wang Tiezhu before, but now that Wang Tiezhu's cultivation level had risen and he had shown considerable talent, Mu Jihan had put away his arrogance.</p><p></p><p>In any case, Zhou You still had to maintain proper vigilance.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the situation has become much more severe again."</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan closed his folding fan in his hand and said with a somewhat grave look, "I heard from a Zhuji cultivator senior brother that low-level second-grade demonic beasts have recently appeared within the border."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhou You's heart skipped a beat, and his brows furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Second-grade low-level demonic beasts? Isn't that equivalent to demonic beasts at the early Zhuji stage?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You frowned and said, "Where did these demonic beasts come from? Were they really released by the cultivators of the Zhengqi Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan nodded, "Eight or nine out of ten, it's the cultivators of the Zhengqi Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Wang Tiezhu was very puzzled, "I heard that the Zhengqi Alliance is just a loose organization formed by a few wandering cultivators. Previously, they were exposed for luring wandering cultivators to join and committing atrocities. But they were easily dispersed by the major families and Taibai Academy. How could they have the ability to do this?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhou You also waited silently for Mu Jihan's answer.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had previously made some speculations about the answer to this question.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's speculation was that although the Zhengqi Alliance seemed to be only a loose organization temporarily formed by a few Condensation Period cultivators, the forces involved behind it were not that simple.</p><p></p><p>One of the three major families in Lincheng, the Wu Family, had some unclear involvement with them.</p><p></p><p>It's possible that the Wu Family was one of the backers behind the Zhengqi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>And from the letters from Senior Brother Fang, it could be seen that the Wu Family wanted to go against Taibai Academy.</p><p></p><p>Going against Taibai Academy meant going against the Great Qi Imperial Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Would a small family like the Wu Family dare to do that?</p><p></p><p>So it could be confirmed that behind the Wu Family, there were other even greater forces involved.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the force behind the Wu Family was also the greatest force behind the Zhengqi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan let out a cold laugh, "If it were only the Zhengqi Alliance, even ten of them wouldn't be enough for Taibai Academy to deal with. It's very clear that the Zhengqi Alliance has other hidden major forces behind it. Otherwise, how could the Zhengqi Alliance possibly accomplish this with their abilities?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan's thoughts coincided with Zhou You's.</p><p></p><p>Probably many others also understood this point.</p><p></p><p>Then Mu Jihan continued, "Everyone, we should hurry and cultivate. It seems Lincheng won't be peaceful."</p><p></p><p>Wang Tiezhu enviously said, "It's easy for Senior Brother Mu. Even if the sky falls, it won't affect you. You're the precious son of the Marquis of Lin'an."</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan smiled without confirming or denying, "Perhaps."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You listened to their conversation but didn't agree with Wang Tiezhu's words. If there really was turmoil, and some forces wanted to move against Taibai Academy and go against the Great Qi Imperial Dynasty, the Marquis of Lin'an would likely be one of the first targets of persecution.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was a royal in-law.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't say much more.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, the pseudo-Condensation cultivator responsible for the lecture finally arrived tardily.</p><p></p><p>However, no one dared utter a word, for after all, he was a pseudo-Condensation cultivator, and his wrath was not something many present could withstand.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was used to it because previously, the lecturing senior brothers were almost always late.</p><p></p><p>And Zhou You found that those at Taibai Academy with slightly higher cultivation levels tended to be rather arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Especially those with some position were extremely arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Only Zhang Lei and Bai Chiyu were exceptions.</p><p></p><p>Wang Tiezhu had complained about this more than once.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Every time he went to collect his monthly cultivation resources, he was treated with negligence by the disciples distributing the resources. There was even one time when his resources were deducted. He complained to the sect's administrators, but it came to nothing in the end. </p><p></p><p>In contrast, those who had just joined the Taibai Academy were much more polite.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't really have an opinion on this, after all he wasn't a disciple of the Taibai Academy.</p><p></p><p>The lecture finally began. </p><p></p><p>The scene gradually became quiet.</p><p></p><p>This fake Dan cultivator was an elderly man with white hair. The old man was very thin, with drooping eyelids as if he hadn't woken up, and spoke in a weak and feeble voice. Fortunately, everyone present was a cultivator with good hearing, so they could all hear him.</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan said this person was called He Taichang. He had been cultivating for over 180 years. Apparently, he had high aptitude when he was young and was arrogant, practicing the most difficult dual cultivation of body and spirit.</p><p></p><p>However, he missed the optimal timing for condensing his Dan pill. The primal energies in his body declined, and he failed in two attempts to condense the pill, ultimately losing the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>He Taichang had a strange temper. If anyone wanted to raise a question, he ignored them.  </p><p></p><p>He spoke about his cultivation experiences at an unhurried pace, as if just completing a task, not caring whether others understood or not.</p><p></p><p>But even so, no one was willing to leave.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You also listened very attentively.  </p><p></p><p>Although He Taichang had an eccentric temper and seemed arrogant, the cultivation experiences he spoke of were indeed very important and substantive. Many people who listened revealed expressions of enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>After listening for a while, Zhou You didn't improve much in his cultivation of the Changchun Gong, but he gained many insights into body refinement.</p><p></p><p>As an expert in dual cultivation of body and spirit, He Taichang had profound comprehension of body refinement.</p><p></p><p>The experiences in body refinement that he lectured on were extremely precious to Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You recorded them all, planning to ponder them repeatedly after returning, which would definitely greatly aid his own body refinement cultivation.</p><p></p><p>With these experiences, perhaps it wouldn't take long before he could fully master the Cuanjujue, then begin cultivating the Qingyuanti.</p><p></p><p>This lecture lasted over four hours.</p><p></p><p>After He Taichang finished speaking, without even looking at the cultivators in the plaza, he transformed into a rainbow and left.</p><p></p><p>"Master He, may I ask a question..."</p><p>"Master He, I still have some doubts..."</p><p>"Master He, please wait a moment..."</p><p></p><p>No matter how the Taibai Academy disciples called out, He Taichang ignored everyone and vanished without a trace in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>This left the Taibai disciples very exasperated, having to give up.</p><p></p><p>"Master He's understanding of qi condensation and foundation establishment has reached the pinnacle. It's a pity his temper is so eccentric, he's never willing to resolve everyone's doubts," Mu Jihan said with some resignation.</p><p></p><p>But Jiang Yuyao said, "That's because, in his view, he has already explained thoroughly enough. If people still can't understand, that's their own problem."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Jiang Yuyao stood up, cupped her hands in farewell to Zhou You and the others.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You remained in his spot for a while longer, carefully pondering He Taichang's words, sorting out those precious experiences, before leaving the plaza.</p><p></p><p>However, on the ancient mountain path down, he encountered Jiang Yuyao.</p><p></p><p>Today Jiang Yuyao wore a white Taoist robe of the Taibai Academy. Her tall and graceful figure had her hair tied up in a high ponytail. Her exquisite features were without any makeup, yet shone with a dazzling smoothness like carved white jade.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she leaned against the white jade railing of the ancient path, watching the clouds rolling over the green mountains.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Jiang, what a coincidence," Zhou You greeted her.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuyao showed a gentle smile. "Not a coincidence, I was waiting here for you, Senior Brother Zhou."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

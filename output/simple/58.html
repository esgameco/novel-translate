        <h1>Chapter 58</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Dan is formed!"</p><p></p><p>After the dan formation, a rich fragrance of elixir spread out from the furnace. </p><p></p><p>Zhou You's eyes flashed, he raised his hand and pointed at the furnace. The furnace lid opened, and immediately ten elixir pills flew out and fell into his hand.</p><p></p><p>However, among these ten pills, only three had a decent quality - round and glossy, giving off a faint fragrance. The other seven were completely black, without any luster, and emitting a burnt odor.</p><p></p><p>The rate of successful dan formation was thirty percent!</p><p></p><p>There is a saying about the rate of successful dan formation. It doesn't mean that as long as it succeeds, all the elixir pills will be good.</p><p></p><p>The high or low rate of successful dan formation completely depends on how well the fire control is grasped during the dan formation process. </p><p></p><p>It is equivalent to the level of proficiency.</p><p></p><p>As a newcomer who had only practiced three times, for Zhou You to have a thirty percent success rate in dan formation was already considered very good.</p><p></p><p>It was probably because of the existence of the Qing Yuan Spiritual Fire. This fire had no additional benefits in other aspects, but it did have a certain enhancement effect on dan formation.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, even a twenty percent success rate would have been very good for Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>[Alchemy Â· Bi Gu Dan (3/100): A mediocre elixir pill. One hundred successfully formed pills are required for completion.]</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the golden seal in his consciousness flashed incessantly, recording the "Bi Gu Dan".</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was not surprised by this.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that my cultivation level is still not enough. If I had earth fire, I could try refining the Pei Yuan Dan."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You destroyed the other seven failed pills, then went outside, pinched one of the Bi Gu Dan into several pieces, and caught a rooster he had raised for two and a half months. He fed one piece of the Bi Gu Dan to the rooster.</p><p></p><p>After observing for half a stick of incense, he found that the rooster was still lively and vigorous.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, no toxicity, it can be consumed."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You nodded with satisfaction. He was afraid that the elixir pills he had refined would be poisonous... After all, some people made mistakes in refining pills. On the surface, they looked the same as normal elixir pills, but they actually contained very strong toxicity.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that the pills he refined were not poisonous, Zhou You excitedly returned to the wooden house and continued refining pills.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Soon it was time to hand in the spiritual fish again.</p><p></p><p>This time, Zhou You handed in eighty-six spiritual fish, but he was called to the inner courtyard by Xiao Yueyingagain.</p><p></p><p>It was the same room. Every time Zhou You saw Xiao Yueying, he was amazed by her otherworldly beauty.</p><p></p><p>She also had the face of a young girl, but compared to Bai Chi Yu, she lacked the youthful vigor of a young girl and had an air of elegance. That lofty demeanor could not be concealed no matter how she smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou You, have you never attended the public lectures at the Taibai Academy?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yueying went straight to the point this time, staring at Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhou You could basically confirm that the jade pendant must have some kind of monitoring function, probably able to determine his location based on the position of the jade pendant.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, there was no way to explain how Xiao Yueying would know that he had never been to the Taibai Academy.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You said, "Miss, fishing for spiritual fish every day consumes a great deal of time. I really don't have spare time to go to the Taibai Academy. Please punish me, Miss."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yueying's exquisite eyebrows raised slightly. After thinking for a moment, she said, "Since you have already cultivated to the first level of Qi Refining, you will be a cultivator of my Xiao family from now on. In the future, you only need to hand in forty spiritual fish per month. Use the extra time to cultivate properly. You must also attend the public lectures at the Taibai Academy, as they will be of great help to you."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You showed a worried expression: "But Miss, your tasks..."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yueying waved her hand dismissively: "It's fine, just go."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Miss."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You stood up and left Xiao Yueying's room.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yueying watched Zhou You's departing back, her gaze gradually becoming firm.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Feng is about to form his Natal Spiritual Core. I must hurry. Zhou You being at only the fourth level of Qi Refining may not be enough. I must find a way to help him reach the ninth level of Qi Refining!"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yueying muttered to herself, "It's been almost two years now, yet he has only reached the first level of Qi Refining."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"At this rate of cultivation, it would be absolutely impossible to reach the 9th level of Qi cultivation within twenty years."</p><p></p><p>She lowered her head and pondered for a moment, then rode her sword towards the direction of the Taibai Academy. </p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After returning to the wooden hut, Zhou You pondered over the jade pendant and couldn't help but sigh lightly. It seemed that attending the public lecture at the Taibai Academy was unavoidable.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You increasingly felt that Xiao Yueying seemed to care a great deal about his cultivation level. </p><p></p><p>She really wanted to improve her own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"If I'm going, then I'll go. It'll be good to hear what form this public lecture takes, perhaps it will truly help my cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You made up his mind, "Besides, as White Pool Fish said before, those Pill Formation cultivators from the Taibai Academy won't be at the academy itself. As long as there are no Pill Formation cultivators present, no one will be able to see through my cultivation level."</p><p></p><p>Currently, Zhou You's spiritual sense had reached the 9th level of Qi cultivation, even surpassing ordinary 9th level Qi cultivation cultivators. When using the Spirit Condensing Art, no cultivator at the Foundation Establishment stage could see through his cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>He didn't need to worry about exposing his cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>With this clear understanding, Zhou You had nothing to fret about and continued on with his activities.</p><p></p><p>Tending to spirit herbs, fishing for spirit fish, cooking, cultivating the Bone Tempering Mantra, practicing the Green Yuan Spirit Fire, pill refining, talisman drawing - everything proceeded in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>Fifteen days later, at an inn closest to the inner court of the Taibai Academy.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You arrived near the academy's mountain gate one day in advance.</p><p></p><p>The location for the Taibai Academy's public lecture was over a thousand li away from where Zhou You resided. Flying on a sword might only take the time to burn one incense stick, but for Zhou You, who outwardly displayed only the 1st level of Qi cultivation, it would take him several hours to get there.</p><p></p><p>So Zhou You arrived at the location near the lecture one day early and stayed at an inn in the inner sect, to avoid arousing suspicion.</p><p></p><p>After Zhou You finished his customary cultivation, the golden imprint in his consciousness flickered.</p><p></p><p>[Longevity Skill (2/100): A rather supreme skill. Cultivating it daily, it can be completed in five and a half years!]</p><p></p><p>Seeing the information on the Longevity Skill, Zhou You was quite satisfied.</p><p></p><p>According to the information provided by the golden imprint, in order to fully cultivate the Longevity Skill to perfection, it would take five and a half years of cultivation time.</p><p></p><p>At that point, Zhou You would reach the 9th level of Qi cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as Zhou You cultivated for two hours daily, in five and a half years he could reach the 9th level of Qi cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This speed was even faster than cultivators with superior spiritual roots!</p><p></p><p>For ordinary cultivators with inferior spiritual roots, going from the 6th to the 9th level of Qi cultivation without any fortuitous encounters would likely take over twenty years!</p><p></p><p>And this was just the information provided by the golden imprint's prompts.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had other methods to increase his speed as well.</p><p></p><p>Such as taking spirit pills.</p><p></p><p>Although Zhou You had developed a resistance to the Qi Replenishing Pill, if he took one daily before cultivating, the original twenty days needed to increase progress by one point could now be halved to just fifteen days.</p><p></p><p>Increasing the speed by one-fourth.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention after his cultivation reached the 7th level of Qi cultivation, he could take Earth Elemental Pills.</p><p></p><p>The effects of the Earth Elemental Pill would definitely be even better.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You exhaled, quite satisfied with this result.</p><p></p><p>He got up and checked the time - dawn was about to break. The Taibai Academy's public lecture was today.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You took the jade pendant, changed into a Daoist robe, and headed towards the Taibai Academy.</p><p></p><p>Looking up, he could already see numerous sword trails streaking across the sky, all heading towards the mountain gate of the Taibai Academy.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Zhou You couldn't help but feel his heart swell with heroic sentiment.</p><p></p><p>This was the world of cultivation!</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had always been lying low, cultivating in seclusion. Occasionally he would see a few sword trails flashing by overhead, but had never witnessed such a grand spectacle.</p>

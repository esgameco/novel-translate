        <h1>Chapter 72</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"It seems Junior Brother Zhou is not too welcoming to us." </p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan looked around vigilantly, but spoke in a very casual tone.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he had already taken out a talisman, holding it between his fingers. He murmured a few incantations, then gave a cold snort and flung out the talisman: "Break!"</p><p></p><p>Obviously, he had just been stalling for time in order to cast this talisman to break the illusion. </p><p></p><p>This talisman for breaking illusions was of the second-grade premium level, quite precious, able to dispel most illusion formations.</p><p></p><p>He reckoned that Zhou You's illusion formation couldn't be that powerful, so as long as he broke the formation, Zhou You would be at their mercy.</p><p></p><p>The talisman for breaking illusions spontaneously combusted, then erupted with a burst of spiritual power that spread out in all directions.</p><p></p><p>As that spiritual power spread outwards, the surrounding environment also gradually changed. The wooden hut that had been destroyed by "Meng Xun" gradually reappeared, and everything returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>They could even see the candlelight inside the wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Mu Jihan had truly broken through the illusion formation.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Zhou, if you don't come out, I'll have to go in."</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan looked at the wooden hut and said indifferently. </p><p></p><p>He did not act rashly, but remained standing outside.</p><p></p><p>Although he had broken through the illusion formation, the minor Five Phases Formation was still surrounding them.</p><p></p><p>This minor Five Phases Formation, though a Qi Refining stage formation, was quite profound and could harm cultivators at the early Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, even Mu Jihan had to be careful.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>There was no movement from inside the wooden hut, and Zhou You still did not respond to them.</p><p></p><p>The injured Senior Brother Liu, who had temporarily suppressed his wounds, gave a cold snort and said icily, "The illusion is gone, yet you still want to play tricks? Courting death!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Senior Brother Liu waved his hand towards the wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>His powerful spiritual energy surged into the ground, and the earth near the hut rumbled loudly.</p><p></p><p>Then, a huge muddy hand burst forth from the ground and slammed down hard on the wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>The wooden hut had no resistance against the muddy hand and immediately collapsed into ruins!</p><p></p><p>Next, the muddy hand scooped up the debris and swiftly brought it before Senior Brother Liu.</p><p></p><p>The muddy hand opened, scattering the remnants of the hut all over, but there was no sign of Zhou You!</p><p></p><p>"He's not there?"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liu frowned, immediately getting a bad feeling.</p><p></p><p>As soon as this feeling arose, Mu Jihan beside him suddenly changed expression and waved his hand towards Senior Brother Liu.</p><p></p><p>A flying sword shot out, instantly piercing through Senior Brother Liu's chest.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liu's eyes widened in disbelief as he stared at "Mu Jihan", utterly dazed.</p><p></p><p>"It's still an illusion!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liu quickly realized what was happening. He stared fixedly at Mu Jihan, a chill running through his heart.</p><p></p><p>This illusion realm was too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>He suddenly recalled that after retreating frantically, Mu Jihan had disappeared, only reappearing later to mention the "illusion formation combined with the minor Five Phases Formation."</p><p></p><p>But the minor Five Phases Formation was an ancient formation recorded in the Tao Te Ching of the Taibai Book Institute - an ordinary person could never come into contact with it, let alone know about the minor Five Phases Formation.</p><p></p><p>Although Mu Jihan was the young master of Linan Prefecture, he should not have heard of the minor Five Phases Formation either.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, Senior Brother Liu had recognized it as the minor Five Phases Formation, but it was just an unconscious reaction, and he had not said it out loud.</p><p></p><p>So how could Mu Jihan possibly know that this formation was the minor Five Phases Formation?</p><p></p><p>It was clear that Mu Jihan was also an illusion - an illusion from Senior Brother Liu's own mind!</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Liu's scalp went numb as he thought of another ancient formation from the Tao Te Ching!</p><p></p><p>The minor Mind-Startling Formation!</p><p></p><p>Just who was this Zhou You? Was he really just a servant of the Xiao family?</p><p></p><p>How could he possibly possess both the minor Five Phases Formation and the minor Mind-Startling Formation at the same time!</p><p></p><p>He dared not think further. Holding his chest wound, he could feel his right lung had been pierced. Combined with his previous injuries, if he remained here any longer, he might really perish.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Kui Wood Demon!"</p><p></p><p>Uncle Liu roared furiously, slapping the spirit beast pouch on his waist. A green spiritual light manifested, instantly transforming into a terrifying monster over 30 feet tall. </p><p></p><p>This monster was a humanoid creature with branch-like hands and feet. On top of the trunk were two greasy green eyes, exuding the aura of a second-grade demonic beast!</p><p></p><p>A second-grade low-level demonic beast, the Kui Wood Demon.</p><p></p><p>Equivalent to a cultivator at the Foundation Establishment stage. </p><p></p><p>Uncle Liu hid behind the Kui Wood Demon, his gaze fierce as he gritted his teeth, "Kui Wood Demon, shred that little beast to pieces!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Uncle Liu's heart was filled with murderous intent. </p><p></p><p>He never imagined he would suffer such a loss at the hands of a mere Qi Cultivating servant of the Xiao Family.</p><p></p><p>He may even perish here!</p><p></p><p>For Uncle Liu, this was an immense humiliation.</p><p></p><p>However, he was somewhat puzzled. Could it be that Zhou You was actually a Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Xiao Family deliberately arranged here?</p><p></p><p>But according to his investigation, Zhou You had only started cultivating three years ago.</p><p></p><p>It was impossible for him to be a Foundation Establishment cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Uncle Liu couldn't figure it out, and at this moment didn't want to think about it anymore, instead controlling the Kui Wood Demon to kill Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>The Kui Wood Demon's spiritual intelligence had not fully awakened, so it was less affected by the illusion formation.</p><p></p><p>The Kui Wood Demon roared upon appearing, waving its branch-like arms that rapidly expanded, the surrounding area filled with dense tangled branches, as if endless.</p><p></p><p>Those branches surged like a waterfall towards the destroyed wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a five-colored light shield appeared, blocking all the branches.</p><p></p><p>Then, a wooden hut manifested under the light shield.</p><p></p><p>Surrounding the hut were many bundles of firewood, and it was pitch black inside.</p><p></p><p>This was Zhou You's real wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>"Five Element Protection Shield!"</p><p></p><p>"Kui Wood Demon, break through it!"</p><p></p><p>Uncle Liu gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>The Kui Wood Demon expanded again, its branch-like legs piercing the ground as countless roots burrowed into the earth, wildly growing like earth dragons rolling towards the wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>"I underestimated Zhou You!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice rang out next to Uncle Liu.</p><p></p><p>It was Mu Jihan's voice. </p><p></p><p>Uncle Liu didn't know when he had returned to his side.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Liu was startled, quickly covering his chest as he shifted several yards away, looking at Mu Jihan with shock and puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>He had just been tricked by the fake Mu Jihan.</p><p></p><p>Now seeing the real Mu Jihan appear, he was like a startled bird.</p><p></p><p>"Young...Young Master, why have you returned?"</p><p></p><p>Uncle Liu asked cautiously.  </p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan glanced at Uncle Liu and frowned, "There is an illusion formation here, I cannot leave. Let's deal with Zhou You first, then break the formation."</p><p></p><p>He was unwilling to act unless absolutely necessary, otherwise he would be unable to conceal his cultivation for a year.</p><p></p><p>This was the limitation of his 'Triple Revolving Prime Cultivation' technique.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Uncle Liu still being so cautious, he felt somewhat annoyed, "I am the real one."</p><p></p><p>Uncle Liu responded, "Oh oh."</p><p></p><p>Though he said that, Uncle Liu still kept a considerable distance from Mu Jihan.</p><p></p><p>That sword strike to the chest earlier had really frightened him.</p><p></p><p>If it had hit his left side, piercing his heart, he would have perished here.</p><p></p><p>"Poofâ€”"</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a green fireball suddenly flew out from inside the wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>That fireball moved extremely fast, instantly smashing into the Kui Wood Demon.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Kui Wood Demon had a faint green shield that blocked the fireball.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, several more fireballs came flying out!</p><p></p><p>I hope the patrons read along daily and vote etc., thank you patrons.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"I should sell the talisman papers I've refined during this period, and then use the proceeds to purchase some spirit pills." </p><p></p><p>Zhou You got up and left the inn. First, he returned to the wooden hut, placed the jade pendant behind it, and then headed to another inner sect.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You found a secluded spot, changed his appearance, suppressed his cultivation to the third level of Qi Refining, and then swiftly went to another nearby inner sect to sell off most of the low-grade talisman papers he had.</p><p></p><p>Next, he went to a nearby market and sold some of his first-grade mid-grade talisman papers, accumulating over a thousand spirit stones. With these, he purchased around twenty Absorbing Primal Pills before returning to the wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>After coming back, Zhou You's life returned to its usual tranquility.</p><p></p><p>Having listened to the public lectures at the Tao White Academy, Zhou You gained new insights into his cultivation of the Long Spring Skill. His speed of practice was now significantly faster than before.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he needed to cultivate for twenty days to increase his progress by one point. Now, he only needed sixteen days to increase by one point.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, Zhou You consumed Absorbing Primal Pills daily, further accelerating his cultivation speed.</p><p></p><p>In the early stages, he only needed twelve days to increase his progress by one point.</p><p></p><p>This was due to the pills' increasing resistance. Otherwise, he could have sped up to eleven days per point.</p><p></p><p>However, after two months passed and the Long Spring Skill's progress reached seven points, Zhou You found that consuming the Absorbing Primal Pills had almost no effect.</p><p></p><p>His body had reached its maximum resistance to the pills.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had no choice but to abandon the Absorbing Primal Pills and instead use the spirit stones from selling talismans to purchase Terrestrial Primal Pills.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, during this period, due to the frequent demonic beast occurrences in various regions, the prices of talisman papers had risen substantially. The prices of healing pills had also increased significantly, but the prices of cultivation pills remained relatively stable, only slightly higher than usual by about half.</p><p></p><p>This meant that by selling the same number of talisman papers, Zhou You could purchase more Terrestrial Primal Pills.</p><p></p><p>For Zhou You, this was certainly good news.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Bai Chi Yu had also visited several times, selling Zhou You the pelts of demonic beasts she had hunted.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Bai Chi Yu wanted to give them to Zhou You for free, but Zhou You insisted on paying. In the end, Bai Chi Yu sold them to him at half price.</p><p></p><p>With this abundant supply of demonic beast pelts, Zhou You had more resources to refine first-grade high-quality talisman papers. The success rate of the Blaze Burst Talisman was also steadily increasing, and his progress was gradually improving. Currently, he was able to make a small profit.</p><p></p><p>Apart from this, Zhou You had not missed any of the Tao White Academy's monthly public lectures over the past two months.</p><p></p><p>Each time he attended these lectures, he gained new insights that slightly increased his cultivation speed, though not as much as the first time.</p><p></p><p>After two lectures, he had barely managed to increase his speed to fifteen days per point of progress.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was very satisfied with this result.</p><p></p><p>Aside from his main cultivation, Zhou You had not neglected his other practices either.</p><p></p><p>The Pill Refining skill for the Fasting Pill had been completed not long ago, granting him a ten-zhang increase in his spiritual sense strength, and his physical strength had also slightly improved.</p><p></p><p>After all, even though it was a basic pill, being able to gain a ten-zhang increase in spiritual sense strength was not bad.</p><p></p><p>His living skills like Planting, Cooking, and Fishing for Mid-Grade Spirit Fish were also steadily improving.</p><p></p><p>Among them, Planting had the highest progress at 61, making Zhou You look forward to what its special trait would be.</p><p></p><p>As for Fishing for Mid-Grade Spirit Fish, since Xiao Yue Ying's demand for low-grade spirit fish had decreased, Zhou You had more time to fish for mid-grade ones, so his speed in this skill had increased quite rapidly, now reaching 38.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, his Cooking skill was progressing much more slowly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Zhou You had not neglected the cultivation of his Primordial Spiritual Flames and the Tempering Bones Manual either. It's just that their improvements had always been relatively stable, requiring a large amount of practice to accumulate progress.</p><p></p><p>And so, Zhou You's cultivation proceeded in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It was proceeding smoothly. Every middle of the month, he would go to the Taibai Academy to listen to the public lectures, and he maintained a good relationship with people like Wang Tiezhu. </p><p></p><p>Occasionally, he could obtain some information about the current situation in Lincheng from them.</p><p></p><p>Especially Wang Tiezhu, this guy was truly knowledgeable about everything. He knew a lot about the happenings in Lincheng. </p><p></p><p>The information obtained from Wang Tiezhu was much more comprehensive than what could be gathered by wandering around the inner sect.</p><p></p><p>It saved him the trouble of roaming the inner sect to gather information.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a year passed. Without realizing it, Zhou You had entered two and a half years of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>On this clear morning, his expression was solemn as he sat cross-legged on the wooden bed, calming his mind and adjusting his inner energy to cultivate the 'Changchun Gong'.</p><p></p><p>He could feel that the seventh meridian located on his back had become extremely condensed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it was emitting a golden light.</p><p></p><p>Today was the time for him to break through to the seventh level of Qi Cultivation!</p><p></p><p>Two hours later, as Zhou You's cultivation ended, the inner energy in the seventh meridian flowed smoothly, and the golden meridian rapidly solidified.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the golden imprint in his consciousness also flickered with light.</p><p></p><p>[Changchun Gong (20/100): A relatively superior cultivation method. Cultivating it daily, it can be completed in five and a half years!]</p><p></p><p>A line of text appeared on the golden imprint.</p><p></p><p>After the transformation, the progress of the 'Changchun Gong' had finally reached 20 points.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's cultivation base also advanced from the sixth level of Qi Cultivation to the seventh level!</p><p></p><p>The powerful inner energy circulated throughout his body, cleansing Zhou You's physical form.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's physical body also improved accordingly, reaching the peak of the seventh level of Body Tempering. It was estimated that it wouldn't be long before he could break through and reach the eighth level of Body Tempering!</p><p></p><p>After half an incense stick's time, Zhou You's inner energy gradually stabilized.</p><p></p><p>"I can try flying on a sword now."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>He had been waiting for this moment for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Riding the wind on a sword, roaming freely between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>It was everyone's dream.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't rush, but first went to take a bath, cleansing the dirt from his body. Only then did he pat his storage bag, causing a blue sword light to fly out and quickly land in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You stepped onto the Qingying Sword, channeling his inner energy into the flying sword, and began to fly unsteadily.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was his first time flying on a sword. Even though he had practiced the method described in the cultivation manual countless times in his mind, when it came to actual practice, he was wobbly and unstable, finding it difficult to control in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Zhou You's adaptability was still quite strong. After practicing for just the time it took an incense stick to burn, he had already mastered it skillfully.</p><p></p><p>Watching the scenery rapidly retreating around him, Zhou You couldn't help but feel a sense of relief, as if he had been "caged for a long time, but now regained his freedom."</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You didn't fly for too long before quickly returning to his place of residence.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had reached the seventh level of Qi Cultivation, there were some matters that needed to be addressed.</p><p></p><p>Such as pill refining!</p><p></p><p>And the formation flags for the Minor Five Elements Formation that should have been refined long ago!</p><p></p><p>These were urgent tasks that needed to be done.</p><p></p><p>In the recent half year, demonic beasts had become increasingly rampant. Even when Zhou You was fishing, he could sense that there were more demonic beasts in Lake Erhai. At such times, Zhou You would avoid them.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't avoid them, he had no choice but to kill them.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, those demonic beasts were at most high-grade demonic beasts of the first rank, with the strongest being equivalent to the existence of the ninth level of Qi Cultivation. It was not difficult for Zhou You to kill them.</p><p></p><p>The emergence of these situations made Zhou You feel that the great battle between the Righteous Sect Alliance and the Taibai Academy might be drawing closer.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Zhou You was putting away his sword, he couldn't help but raise his eyebrows in surprise. His spiritual sense sank into his consciousness and found that the golden imprint was flickering at this moment.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

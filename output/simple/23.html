        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Watching Zhou You leave, Xiao Yueying had a pensive look on her face. </p><p></p><p>"He indeed has not opened his meridians yet. In just four months of cultivation, this is the only spiritual power he has built up. I don't know if he can reach the fourth level of Qi cultivation within twenty years. It seems I still need to urge him to focus on his cultivation."</p><p></p><p>For the demonic secret technique she practiced, when forming the pill, the spirit roots devoured during that process must be from someone at the fourth level of Qi cultivation or above in order to increase the success rate. </p><p></p><p>If Zhou You cannot reach the fourth level of Qi cultivation, then even if devoured, it would be useless.</p><p></p><p>After analyzing for a moment, Xiao Yueying seemed to have made up her mind about something: "Twenty years later will be the day to compete for the inheritance. I wonder if the existence of the Zhengqi Alliance has anything to do with the inheritance of Taibai Academy."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yueying's position was quite high, so naturally she knew relatively more.</p><p></p><p>The Zhengqi Alliance appeared to be a Xianxia scam organization that specializes in luring scattered cultivators and fish servants, testing them, and then selling them to mines and demonic cultivators in exchange for spirit stones and cultivation resources.</p><p></p><p>However, Xiao Yueying received information that the leader of the Zhengqi Alliance, Zhao Yuding, seemed to be using this as a pretext to search for someone.</p><p></p><p>And this person seemed to be related to the inheritance of Taibai Academy.</p><p></p><p>But now that the Zhengqi Alliance no longer exists, pondering over it is useless.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yueying closed her beautiful eyes and continued her cultivation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was unaware of Xiao Yueying's thoughts, but he was already on guard against her.</p><p></p><p>After leaving Xiao Yueying's room, he returned to the outer courtyard with Xiao Qing.</p><p></p><p>When Zhou You and Xiao Qing returned to the outer courtyard, those servants were still waiting for Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhou You, they hurried over and said some polite flattering words.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You responded to them neither humbly nor arrogantly.  </p><p></p><p>When they expressed wanting to invite him for a meal, Zhou You politely declined.</p><p></p><p>It was not that he looked down on these servants. If it were before, he might have accepted. But now, he valued his time greatly.</p><p></p><p>He had just mastered many new abilities, be it the Fire Bead Technique or the middle chapters of the Meridian Opening Manual, all of which required diligent practice.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Fire Bead Technique, which required a large amount of time every day.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the Fire Bead Technique, he also needed to improve his Grinding and Chopping skills.</p><p></p><p>As well as test whether medicinal herbs could shorten their growth cycle through his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>So he was very busy now.</p><p></p><p>After declining the servants, on his way back Zhou You passed by the inner district and purchased a martial arts manual called 'Body Shrinking Technique', spending over a hundred taels of silver on a boxing manual, as well as some common medicinal herb seeds.</p><p></p><p>Such as ginseng and astragalus.</p><p></p><p>Although after killing Huang Li, Zhou You had obtained a large amount of gold and silver, if converted entirely to silver it would be at least thousands of taels.</p><p></p><p>But to be cautious, Zhou You did not reveal too much money, otherwise even ordinary silver taels could attract the attention of some ill-intentioned people.</p><p></p><p>After all, Zhou You was just a servant, how could he have so much money?</p><p></p><p>After buying these things, Zhou You returned to his wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>Upon returning, he found that the sword-wielding girl who had disappeared for almost two months had actually come back.</p><p></p><p>This surprised Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>The girl had not come for over a month, so he thought she would never come again, but unexpectedly she came back today.</p><p></p><p>She was fishing in the same old spot, with willow branches hanging over her, gently swaying in the breeze.</p><p></p><p>When Zhou You came back, the girl turned her head to look at him.</p><p></p><p>But when Zhou You looked at her, she quickly averted her gaze, even using her hand to support her left cheek, deliberately blocking her line of sight.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You could not help but smile, amused by this girl's actions.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You did not bother her either. After putting down his things, he planted the medicinal herb seeds he bought, watered them, took two spiritual fish, and skillfully started processing them.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Nowadays he has already stood firm here, able to hand over ninety spiritual fish to Xiao Yueying every month. So even if someone discovered that he ate two spiritual fish, it was no big deal. </p><p></p><p>No one would think too much about it.</p><p></p><p>During this time, the young lady had been secretly watching Zhou You, seeming very curious about his every move.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, under the setting sun, a strong fragrant smell wafted over from beside Zhou You's wooden hut. </p><p></p><p>The young lady, who was still fishing far away, wrinkled her little nose, unable to help but look towards Zhou You again, her eyes revealing a hint of longing.</p><p></p><p>However, when Zhou You looked back, she hurriedly averted her gaze and focused wholeheartedly on fishing for spiritual fish.</p><p></p><p>She still couldn't catch any spiritual fish.</p><p></p><p>Fishing seemed to be an extremely difficult task for her.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's fish was done grilling. He turned to look at the young lady and knew that she still hadn't caught any in this entire hour.</p><p></p><p>This made Zhou You very curious about who this young lady was and why she was so insistent on fishing here.</p><p></p><p>Adding it all up, it had been two months.</p><p></p><p>For two whole months, she hadn't caught a single spiritual fish.</p><p></p><p>If it were an ordinary person, they would have given up long ago.</p><p></p><p>Yet she had come again.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You took the grilled spiritual fish and walked towards the young lady.</p><p></p><p>The young lady had clearly noticed Zhou You coming over. Her eyes became a bit flustered, like she had been caught doing something bad. She unconsciously shifted her bottom, occasionally glancing over with those big eyes in an amusingly evasive manner.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You handed her the grilled fish skewered on a bamboo stick without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>The young lady hesitated for a moment but still grasped the bamboo stick. Then she tore off a piece of the fish meat with her hands and carefully put it in her mouth.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the young lady's eyes lit up, seeming very happy.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You stood by the side, chewing on the spiritual fish while observing the young lady.</p><p></p><p>It was only then that he realized this young lady's looks were even more exquisite than Xiao Yueying's by a notch!</p><p></p><p>The young lady was only fifteen or sixteen years old. Her skin was as white as jade, her face beautifully out of the ordinary. Her eyelashes were long and curled, her eyes without any impurities. Her straight, exquisite nose and full lips. A cascade of long hair covered her jade-like back, and even the loose white Daoist robe couldn't conceal her slender waist.</p><p></p><p>She was truly a peerless beauty that could topple nations and cities!</p><p></p><p>After seeing the young lady, Zhou You finally believed that in the previous era there really were such bizarre things as "beauties causing wars among feudal lords."</p><p></p><p>It's a pity.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You glanced at the purple long sword embroidered on the young lady's sleeve, which represented Taibai Academy.</p><p></p><p>The young lady was a cultivator from Taibai Academy. Moreover, her temperament was as elegant as an orchid, ethereal like a fairy. Her background must be extraordinary as well, completely different from his own path.</p><p></p><p>He shook his head and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>The young lady also saw Zhou You shake his head. Immediately, a blush of shyness appeared on her little face. Her motions of tearing the fish became even smaller, and she even slowly lowered her head.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zhou You did not observe the young lady any further. After taking a good look at her, he returned to his residence.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the grilled fish, he took out the newly purchased 'Body Shrinking Technique' and a set of boxing manuals to study.</p><p></p><p>The Body Shrinking Technique was naturally prepared for going to the market to sell goods in the future. As for the boxing manuals, they were for learning and enhancing his physical strength.</p><p></p><p>For Zhou You at the third level of Qi cultivation, practicing these mundane martial arts was relatively simple.</p><p></p><p>In just half a stick of incense's time, the 'Body Shrinking Technique' had already been recorded in his golden imprint, and he was prompted that it would take ten days of cultivation to fully master it.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was not in a hurry. He practiced today's progress to completion and felt that his whole body had become much lighter, greatly improving his control over his body.</p><p></p><p>He could slightly change the length of his hands and feet, having gained some control over his bones.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

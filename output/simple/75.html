        <h1>Chapter 75</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>For Zhou You, these two questions were both quite important. </p><p></p><p>According to what Master Liu said, the Taibai Academy had already rotted away, and even the Condensing Dan cultivators had inside agents in Linan Prefecture, not to mention the Foundation Establishment cultivators. Taibai Academy likely had many inside agents from Linan Prefecture among the Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, if Zhou You could obtain the list of names of these people, he could be more careful and vigilant in the future, and be on guard against those people.</p><p></p><p>As for whether Master Liu had any identity tokens that could be used for positioning, such as the white jade sword bone that Huang Li had before, which would give off a warning when a certain talisman approached.</p><p></p><p>Master Liu was at least a Foundation Establishment cultivator after all.</p><p></p><p>If his corpse could be refined into a Foundation Establishment zombie for the Five Ghosts Killing Formation, and five Foundation Establishment zombie corpses were gathered, then even if they encountered a late Foundation Establishment cultivator in the future, it would not necessarily be frightening.</p><p></p><p>So Master Liu's corpse could not be destroyed and erased.</p><p>Keeping it would be greatly useful.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, according to what was said about the Five Ghosts Killing Formation, once a corpse was refined, it would become part of the Five Ghosts Killing Formation. Even if it had something like the white jade sword bone that Huang Li had, no one would be able to find it.</p><p></p><p>Everything about this corpse would be under Zhou You's control, without any worries.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Zhou You naturally wanted to confirm whether there were any identity tokens that could be used for positioning. If he destroyed the identity tokens, there would be no issues.</p><p></p><p>Master Liu replied, "There are identity tokens, but they cannot be used for positioning. The inside agents I know of in the Taibai Academy are Zhang Qinruo, Yu Shiru, Dong Renbin, Qiao Zhongyan, Zhong Chengxu, Zuo Huai..."</p><p></p><p>"Ugh...puh!"</p><p></p><p>When Master Liu said the sixth name, his life could ultimately no longer be prolonged. His throat made an eerie sound, his body trembled, and he fell to the ground, eyes wide open, unblinking in death.</p><p></p><p>[Soul Control (20/100): A very common spirit technique. Adds 10 progress when used on Qi Refining cultivators, 20 progress on Foundation Establishment cultivators.]</p><p></p><p>And at that moment, the golden talisman in his consciousness began to flicker.</p><p></p><p>[Soul Control] was also recorded into the golden talisman.</p><p></p><p>This was somewhat unexpected for Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>However, he only glanced at it before withdrawing his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked at Master Liu's appearance and couldn't help but shake his head.</p><p></p><p>Then his spirit sense scanned Master Liu's body, and after confirming that there was nothing else hidden in his clothes, Zhou You took out his storage bag. He didn't bother with anything else for the time being, only taking out the two identity jade plaques.</p><p></p><p>One was from the Taibai Academy, and one was from Linan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, he crushed them and then incinerated them with azure spirit flames.</p><p></p><p>After doing these things, Zhou You finally walked over to Mu Jihan.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked at Mu Jihan, his gaze somewhat complex.</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan spoke properly, and every time he gave a public lecture before, he and Zhou You got along quite well. Mu Jihan had popularized quite a bit of knowledge for Zhou You and also brought Zhou You a lot of news related to Lincheng.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Zhou You's impression of this Mu Jihan was not bad.</p><p></p><p>It's just a pity.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, why did you have to try to kill me?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You shook his head slowly, feeling somewhat resigned.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had heard the conversation between Mu Jihan and Master Liu.</p><p></p><p>Once he fell into Mu Jihan's hands, he would either become a puppet or be body snatched.</p><p></p><p>Wang Tiezhu most likely met that fate.</p><p></p><p>So Zhou You did not hesitate to strike him down.</p><p></p><p>If you won't let me live well, then I can only kill you.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the unconscious Mu Jihan.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You unhesitatingly used Soul Control.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the Small Shocking Spirit Formation, Zhou You still had the ability to use Soul Control twice.</p><p></p><p>As Zhou You's spirit sense drilled into Mu Jihan's consciousness, Mu Jihan's body began to tremble violently. He suddenly opened his eyes wide, filled with pain.</p><p></p><p>But just a moment later, Mu Jihan's gaze became dull.</p><p></p><p>"Your identity."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You asked.</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan paused for a moment before answering, "The tenth son of the Marquis of Linan, a commoner son of Linan Prefecture, an inner disciple of the Tiannan Valley in Nanzhoushan named Li Huai'an."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You raised his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>The tenth son of the Marquis of Lin'an?</p><p></p><p>Well, did the Marquis of Lin'an take the path of having many sons for good fortune?</p><p></p><p>And Mu Jihan was actually an inner disciple of the Tiannan Valley in Nanzhou, using the alias Li Huai'an.</p><p></p><p>It could be guessed that Mu Jihan was discovered to have spiritual roots when he was young, so the Marquis of Lin'an secretly sent him to Tiannan Valley, giving him the alias "Li Huai'an" to become an inner disciple there and cultivate.</p><p></p><p>When the time came for the Marquis of Lin'an to rebel, he would then summon Mu Jihan back.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You continued to ask, "What was your mission infiltrating Taibai Academy, and why were you targeting me?"</p><p></p><p>Although Zhou You had asked Uncle Liu this question before, Uncle Liu was not a core member of the Lin'an Manor, so it was very possible that Mu Jihan had another mission at Taibai Academy that he didn't tell Uncle Liu about.</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan answered expressionlessly, "To find an opportunity to control Xiao Yueying, and seize the Taibai Sword Immortal's inheritance to pave the way for the Marquis of Lin'an's revival. As Xiao Yueying's servant and the only cultivator able to get close to her, you were naturally our first choice."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Mu Jihan's answer added the part about seizing the Taibai Sword Immortal's inheritance.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You said, "What is the Taibai Sword Immortal's inheritance?"</p><p></p><p>"Over a thousand years ago, the Taibai Sword Immortal single-handedly guarded Luoshui Pass and forced back tens of thousands of demon tribes with a single sword strike, leaving behind a sword formation at the pass and an inheritance within. Whoever obtains the inheritance can control the sword formation and comprehend the Sword Immortal's enlightenment."</p><p></p><p>"How does one obtain the inheritance?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know."</p><p></p><p>"It's said that the Marquis of Lin'an has no spiritual roots, so how would he have the ability to rebel?"</p><p></p><p>"That's just an outward appearance. In reality, my father has hidden spiritual roots that can't be detected by ordinary means, only by cultivating special techniques. He was the eldest legitimate son back then, but was stripped of his position as crown prince and sent to Lin'an because he had no spiritual roots. Later, by a fortuitous opportunity, he obtained a technique suitable for his hidden roots and developed the idea of restoring his position."</p><p></p><p>"Didn't the current Emperor consider eliminating this potential threat back then?"</p><p></p><p>"In the eyes of outsiders, my father's life ended over five hundred years ago. The current Marquis of Lin'an on the surface is just a descendant from later generations of the Lin'an Manor."</p><p></p><p>"So your current outward identity is just as a son of the current Marquis of Lin'an, but your true identity is as the son of the first Marquis of Lin'an?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"How many experts does the Lin'an Manor currently have, and what is their strength?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know how many have reached the Yuan Ying realm, but there are countless at the Condensing Pellet realm."</p><p></p><p>"Which forces are connected to the Lin'an Manor?"</p><p></p><p>"Most of the major forces in Nanzhou. I was in charge of the Wu Family in Lincheng and the Yulin Mountain Manor, but I'm not clear about the others."</p><p></p><p>"Do you have any identity tokens on you that could be used for positioning?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Heir's Jade Tablet!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You felt a bit shaken upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Most of the major forces in Nanzhou were connected to the Lin'an Manor. The Lin'an Manor's development in the shadows over the past five hundred years was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Their ambition to rebel must have existed a very long time ago.</p><p></p><p>The first Marquis of Lin'an was terrifyingly meticulous!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he was so calculating that even Mu Jihan, the heir, didn't know which forces in Nanzhou were connected to the Lin'an Manor.</p><p></p><p>"Which people in Taibai Academy are yours? When were you planning to start the war?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You continued asking these questions.</p><p></p><p>However, this time Mu Jihan didn't answer, because his eyes were blank and there was no life aura left in his body.</p><p></p><p>After being controlled for so long, even a Condensing Pellet cultivator couldn't withstand it.</p><p></p><p>His sea of consciousness had collapsed, and Mu Jihan's life had come to an end.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You had already asked the important questions he wanted answers to.</p><p></p><p>As for which people in Taibai Academy were theirs, Zhou You had already learned some information, so he just needed to be careful of the people at Taibai Academy going forward. Whether he knew the specifics or not didn't matter much.</p><p></p><p>As for when they would start the war, Zhou You had already learned about it initially from Senior Martial Brother Fang's letter, so he just wanted to confirm it now.</p><p></p><p>In any case, he could basically confirm that before the war started, he would be able to break through to the Condensing Pellet realm and then leave this place far behind.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

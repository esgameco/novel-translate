        <h1>Chapter 36</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Knock him out." </p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest with the surname Li spoke, his slender body extremely agile as he swiftly left the room.</p><p></p><p>The fat Taoist priest didn't hesitate to knock out the fish servant, then quickly followed after the Li priest: "Brother Li, why don't we just...kill him?"</p><p></p><p>Li's footsteps paused as he said incredulously: "What, why have you become so coldhearted now?"</p><p></p><p>The fat priest said helplessly: "I feel that in his current state, it might be better to just kill him."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The Li priest cursed: "Are you stupid? All these fish servants have soul imprints on them. If they die, won't their masters know?"</p><p></p><p>The fat priest thought about it and realized it made sense, so he could only nod.</p><p></p><p>The two swiftly climbed out of the room, heading towards the other rooms.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Woo woo woo--"</p><p></p><p>The early winter winds carried a biting chill. The tree leaves rustled loudly as they were blown about. The moon in the sky flickered in and out of view behind dark clouds. The cyan mountains were hidden in darkness, like an ancient giant beast lying in wait to devour its chosen prey.</p><p></p><p>The fat and thin priests went in and out of those rooms, unknowingly harming countless fish servants.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li, this is the last one. If he doesn't know either, wouldn't this trip have been for nothing?"</p><p></p><p>The fat priest said worriedly, furrowing his brow.</p><p></p><p>The Li priest's expression was also not good. He said in a low voice: "Let's see this last person first before deciding. I heard that those fish servants don't all live together, with many scattered around Erhai Lake. If this last person has no information either, then we'll have the fish servants take us to find the others."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>The fat priest forced a wry smile, having no choice but to follow the Li priest.</p><p></p><p>The two climbed into the last room and again used a soul-controlling technique to take control of the sleeping fish servant on the bed.</p><p></p><p>The fish servant turned over and sat up. In the dim moonlight filtering in, the fat and thin priests saw that this was a fish servant as thin as a monkey - if they had met him before, they would recognize him as Wang Ping, someone they had a decent relationship with.</p><p></p><p>"What is your name?" the Li priest asked, following the usual procedure to confirm the soul-controlling technique was successful.</p><p></p><p>Wang Ping's eyes were glazed over, his dark face expressionless as he replied dully: "Wang Ping."</p><p></p><p>The Li priest asked: "Tell me everything about you and Huang Li."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Wang Ping paused for a few breaths before beginning to speak slowly.</p><p></p><p>The first part was nothing new - the priests had heard it many times before, just general impressions of Huang Li.</p><p></p><p>Just as they thought they wouldn't get any useful new information again, Wang Ping provided the key details:</p><p></p><p>"I'm one of Huang Li's subordinate lines, usually scouting potential candidates for him. Huang Li had a very close relationship with Zhou You, the fish servant of the Xiao family's young miss. All of Zhou You's information came from me to Huang Li. Huang Li had also invited Zhou You to join the Zhengqi Alliance before, but Zhou You refused and publicly stated he never received Huang Li's invitation."</p><p></p><p>"About four months ago, I woke up in the night and saw what seemed to be Huang Li's figure heading towards Zhou You's residence. Huang Li never appeared again after that, so he must have gone to see Zhou You."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Li priest and fat priest exchanged a delighted look!</p><p></p><p>They had finally obtained information about Huang Li!</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, this last person turned out to be one of Huang Li's men, hiding so deeply.</p><p></p><p>"What's this Zhou You's background and cultivation level?"</p><p></p><p>The Li priest asked.</p><p></p><p>Wang Ping said: "A few months ago, he came here at the orders of the Xiao family's young miss to fish for spirit fish. He still hasn't succeeded in opening his meridians."</p><p></p><p>Not having opened his meridians meant he hadn't even reached the first level of Qi cultivation practice.</p><p></p><p>This put the Li priest's mind at ease. He then asked: "Since you saw Huang Li, why didn't you contact him?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Ping replied: "I was afraid he would kill me to silence me."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest with the surname Li said, "Take us to Zhou You's residence."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Wang Ping stood up numbly, then walked towards the outside of the house.</p><p></p><p>The fat Taoist priest said, "Brother Li, it seems we really need to find information about Huang Li!"</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest with the surname Li also revealed a surprised expression, "Haha, as long as we find Huang Li, we have hope of building our foundations!"</p><p></p><p>Saying that, the two followed Wang Ping and went out.</p><p></p><p>However, before leaving, the fat Taoist priest said, "Brother Li, if not, wait for me for a moment. I see there are still some good things inside these fish servant's quarters, and it would be good to take those spirit fish away."</p><p></p><p>"There's no time. We must leave before daybreak."</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest with the surname Li urged him, and the fat Taoist priest had no choice but to quickly follow Wang Ping.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the two thin and fat Taoists took advantage of the night and quickly made their way near Zhou You's wooden house.</p><p></p><p>"Wait."</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest with the surname Li stopped Wang Ping, his eyes flickering with a cold light as he stared at the distant wooden house.</p><p></p><p>The night had grown late, reaching the third night watch. The wooden house was pitch black, with no movement inside.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li, why don't we let this guy go explore and see if that fish servant is inside?" the fat Taoist priest suggested.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest with the surname Li shook his head, "Going there in the middle of the night, anyone would find it strange. Moreover, this person is under a soul-controlling technique, so it's too easy for him to be seen through. Let's sneak over directly."</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>The fat Taoist priest nodded.</p><p></p><p>The two knocked Wang Ping unconscious, then headed towards Zhou You's wooden house.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they approached the wooden house.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest with the surname Li suddenly frowned, raised his hand to pat the storage bag on his waist, and immediately a palm-sized bell flew out.</p><p></p><p>This bell emitted a faint glow and shook slightly, but no ringing sound came out.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Liu, it seems we've found the right place!"</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest with the surname Li said excitedly, "Huang Li is indeed in this place!"</p><p></p><p>The fat Taoist priest was also excited, as if he could see the foundation-building pill right in front of them.</p><p></p><p>This bell was specially refined by an elder of the Righteous Sect, containing Huang Li's aura. As long as it was near Huang Li, it would give a warning.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, the bell's indication meant that Huang Li was nearby!</p><p></p><p>This made the two thin and fat Taoists look towards Zhou You's wooden house.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest with the surname Li said, "It seems Huang Li is hiding in this fish servant's quarters to recuperate. The guy is quite clever, playing a trick on the Taibai Academy. It's fortunate we came early!"</p><p></p><p>The fat Taoist priest was also somewhat excited, "That's great, let's quickly capture Huang Li and go find the elder to exchange for the foundation-building pill!"</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priest with the surname Li nodded, walked slowly towards the wooden house, and reminded, "Huang Li has the cultivation of the fourth layer of Qi refining. We must be careful and not remove the stealth talisman yet."</p><p></p><p>"Mm!"</p><p></p><p>The fat Taoist priest took out a stack of talismans, vigilantly watching the wooden house. As a talisman master, he had plenty of talismans if nothing else.</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, the door of the wooden house suddenly opened.</p><p></p><p>The two immediately became tense, with the fat Taoist priest ready to activate the talismans in his hand at any time.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment, they were both stunned, and their expressions changed slightly as they respectfully bowed their hands.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Meng Xun!"</p><p></p><p>The person who came out was actually a handsome and strange-looking young man.</p><p></p><p>The young man had narrow eyes and thin lips, a jade-like fair complexion, with a scholarly air.</p><p></p><p>They never expected that the person coming out of this wooden house would be an elder of their own Righteous Sect.</p><p></p><p>The fat Taoist priest didn't think too much, too scared to even breathe loudly, while the Taoist priest with the surname Li quickly changed his thoughts, wondering what was going on.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

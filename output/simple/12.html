        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhou, you really need to think this through carefully. Look at me - I've been a fish servant for Huo Yunhao for three years, and even now I've only reached the first level of qi cultivation. There's no hope for me to build a foundation in this lifetime!" </p><p></p><p>Huang Li earnestly advised: "It's not hard to imagine that my current state is exactly what you'll look like three years from now! If you don't live for yourself and give it your all just once, how can you possibly go further?"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhou, go crazy to succeed, go all out during the foundation building period!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Li's words made Zhou You become more vigilant. </p><p></p><p>However, he didn't show it on the surface. He sighed and said, "Brother Huang, the young lady has indeed treated me well, and she has promised to grant me freedom after I reach the third level of qi cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the latter part was fabricated by Zhou You.</p><p>Xiao Yueying had never said anything about granting Zhou You freedom.</p><p></p><p>Huang Li became somewhat anxious. "Brother Zhou, you must not believe the words of those noble scions. In their eyes, we are like ants. You have to believe in yourself. If you don't go out and adventure, you'll forever be beneath others!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You still shook his head. "Brother Huang, let's just pretend I don't know about today's matter. Thank you for the spirit fish."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Huang Li knew Zhou You had made up his mind not to go with him, so he could only sigh lightly with a regretful look. He then took out a note and handed it to Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhou, we've known each other for a while. If you change your mind in the future, you can find me at the address on this note. If I manage to establish myself in the Righteous Sect, I'll definitely not forget you."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You took the note, nodded in thanks, and continued chatting with Huang Li.</p><p></p><p>After that, Huang Li didn't try to persuade Zhou You again. However, he didn't have any intention to stay either. After chatting for a while, he advised Zhou You not to spread the word, and then took his leave.</p><p></p><p>Watching Huang Li's departing back, Zhou You couldn't help but fall into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, he wouldn't spread the news of Huang Li's plan to escape.</p><p></p><p>However, he felt that Huang Li's trip was unreliable.  </p><p></p><p>This matter wasn't that simple; the existence of the Righteous Sect seemed too abrupt.</p><p></p><p>In this world, were there really such good things?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You shook his head, feeling that only things he struggled for himself would be dependable. Receiving undue favors from others wasn't a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Even Xiao Yueying's abnormal kindness made Zhou You feel unsettled.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Zhou You had the Golden Talisman of Great Simplicity, so there was no need to take risks by joining the Righteous Sect.</p><p></p><p>Although Huang Li said there wouldn't be any danger, joining the Righteous Sect would inevitably lead to contact with other cultivators, which would naturally add unforeseen dangers.</p><p></p><p>Before his strength was strong enough, Zhou You didn't want to put himself in a dangerous situation.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of caution, Zhou You rejected Huang Li's invitation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Huang Li left, Zhou You's brow furrowed slightly as his consciousness turned inward.</p><p></p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the golden talisman flickered with light, and a line of text slowly appeared:</p><p></p><p>[Opening the Meridians Scripture, Part 1 (61/100): A basic cultivation manual. Exhaling and inhaling daily can increase progress by 1. It can be completed in 100 days!]</p><p></p><p>The progress of the Opening the Meridians Scripture had unexpectedly increased by one point!</p><p></p><p>This surprised Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be because of the spirit fish?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was puzzled as he carefully recalled that he didn't seem to have any other way to increase his spiritual power, only the spirit fish!</p><p></p><p>"Including tonight's spirit fish, I've eaten a total of twenty-one spirit fish. Excluding the ones I couldn't eat or wasted, that should be twenty spirit fish that increased my progress by one point!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You analyzed.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at this conclusion, Zhou You felt elated.</p><p></p><p>Although the spirit fish didn't increase the Opening the Meridians Scripture's progress by much, only about twenty fish for one point of progress, this was still good news.</p><p></p><p>From now on, the spirit fish he deducted would at least have some use!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Zhou...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was in a great mood. He took out his rusty iron sword and began practicing the Light and Shadow Sword technique. </p><p></p><p>Half a period of time later.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You put away the iron sword with a flushed face, feeling a bit overwhelmed after practicing swordsmanship after drinking alcohol. </p><p></p><p>However, this negative state was quickly cleared away.</p><p></p><p>The golden seal in Zhou You's spiritual ocean flashed brightly again.</p><p></p><p>Golden words reappeared.</p><p></p><p>[Light and Shadow Sword Technique (100/100): A very simple sword technique, practice it five times a day, and you can master it in a month!]</p><p></p><p>The Light and Shadow Sword Technique was finally perfected!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You felt a huge surge of mysterious power gushing out from the golden seal, instantly pervading his limbs and meridians.</p><p></p><p>That mysterious power traveled through his entire body, and the negative state vanished in an instant, even the slight drunkenness from the alcohol was gone.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Zhou You felt all his muscles starting to go numb.</p><p></p><p>An extremely comfortable feeling welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Ah——"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You couldn't help but let out a cry, then a large amount of black impurities gushed out from the pores all over his body.</p><p></p><p>There were far more impurities than when he broke through levels of cultivation!</p><p></p><p>As the impurities surged out, Zhou You clearly felt his overall physical strength greatly increase!</p><p></p><p>His four limbs and hundreds of bones were filled with power!</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's eyes flickered, utterly astonished: "The first level of Body Tempering?"</p><p></p><p>The Body Tempering realm is actually the Qi Refining stage.</p><p></p><p>It is a type of physical cultivation realm, also with nine levels, and the first level of Body Tempering corresponds to the first level of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>Physical cultivation is another way of practicing in the cultivation world, not cultivating spiritual power, but focusing on tempering the body. The difficulty is many times greater than spiritual cultivation!</p><p></p><p>Not only does it take a huge amount of time, but it also requires a large quantity of medicinal materials to temper the body.</p><p></p><p>Usually it is the clansmen of major cultivation families who have no spiritual roots and cannot practice spiritual cultivation who are forced to take the path of physical cultivation out of necessity.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary people to step onto the path of physical cultivation is impossible.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You heard Huang Li mention that the realms of physical cultivation are different from spiritual cultivation only at the first stage, after which they are the same.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that with the extremely difficult physical cultivation, he would successfully enter the first level of Body Tempering just from perfecting the practice of the Light and Shadow Sword Technique!</p><p></p><p>In other words, now Zhou You could smash cultivators at the first level of Qi Refining with just his physical strength alone!</p><p></p><p>At the same level, if a physical cultivator can get in close, they can often crush spiritual cultivators!</p><p></p><p>"It seems that cultivating martial arts manuals can increase my physical strength, and this is also a path of cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts manuals are simplified versions of physical cultivation methods, also evolved from physical cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary people to cultivate these mortal martial arts, it's difficult to make any progress even after decades, but Zhou You has the golden seal, allowing him to gain such enhancements.</p><p></p><p>If he can obtain physical cultivation methods in the future, the enhancements will likely be even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Of course, that's a topic for later. With Zhou You's current financial resources, it's unrealistic to obtain physical cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>For now, Zhou You's focus is still on obtaining the middle section of the Meridian Opening Manual, as well as finding a way to conceal his cultivation, otherwise he feels too lacking in security.</p><p></p><p>The means to conceal one's cultivation is actually not that difficult to obtain. After accumulating enough spirit sand, he can go to the Inner Sect to buy a manual.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You has inquired about it - this most basic method of concealing cultivation is not expensive, only requiring a few spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>For others, this method is quite useless, but for Zhou You, it is the most needed. As long as he does not directly interact with spiritual cultivators or use spiritual power himself, it will be very difficult for others to detect that he has concealed his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Please give me a recommendation vote and monthly vote, I don't have any, it's quite sad.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

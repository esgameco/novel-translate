        <h1>Chapter 37</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Meng Xun was an elder of the Zhengqi Alliance, with a false Dan cultivation level. He was also the most eccentric existence within the Zhengqi Alliance. Many scattered cultivators and fish servants who were deceived into joining the Zhengqi Alliance, even before being sold off, died at Meng Xun's hands. </p><p></p><p>Even many members of the Zhengqi Alliance died by Meng Xun's hands.</p><p></p><p>This person Meng Xun had unpredictable emotions.</p><p></p><p>Previously, a cultivator with the surname Li was merely looked at by Meng Xun, and for two to three days his mind was uneasy, showing how intimidating Meng Xun was to these lower-level cultivators of the Zhengqi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>If asked who they feared the most, both the cultivator Li and the fat cultivator would unhesitatingly choose Meng Xun.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>"Elder Meng Xun had already left Lincheng city long ago, hiding in the Ten Thousand Great Mountains to evade the encirclement of righteous sects like Taibai Academy and Taixuan Gate. How could he appear here?"</p><p></p><p>The cultivator Li was quite nimble-minded and thought more deeply. His spiritual sense scanned the Meng Xun who came out, but did not detect any clues, yet still felt something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Liu, something's not right!"</p><p></p><p>The cultivator Li called out, wanting to warn the fat cultivator.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as the words left his mouth and he looked up, there was no "Elder Meng Xun" at the doorway, only a seven-foot flying sword emitting a yellow glow!</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>The cultivator Li's face changed greatly. He immediately activated his magic shield, retreating madly. While retreating, he patted his storage bag and took out an umbrella, opening it to block in front of him.</p><p></p><p>As for that fat cultivator, by the time he reacted, it was already too late!</p><p></p><p>That yellow light sword moved extremely fast, arriving before the fat cultivator in the blink of an eye!</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator's face changed drastically. Just as he wanted to throw out the stack of talisman papers in his hand, at that moment, a terrifying spiritual sense violently crashed into his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator's whole body shuddered. He stood dazed, immediately bleeding from his mouth and nose, his eyes vacant and his face full of pain.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the yellow light sword flashed across the fat cultivator's neck as a streak of yellow light.</p><p></p><p>"Puh!"</p><p></p><p>A perfectly good head flew out, blood gushing like a fountain from the severed neck.</p><p></p><p>"Thump--"</p><p></p><p>The fat headless corpse fell to the ground, blood instantly dyeing the earth red.</p><p></p><p>One fat, one thin - one immediately died!</p><p></p><p>Then the yellow light sword wavered, transforming into a long rainbow arc and returning into the wooden house, its door closing.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator Li watched in shock and terror, retreating two more steps, staring fixedly at the wooden house in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"The Yellow Light Sword!"</p><p></p><p>"An Illusion Formation!"</p><p></p><p>The cultivator Li glared and said through gritted teeth: "Huang Li! I know you're inside! Your methods are truly audacious, specifically laying down an illusion formation to deal with us, even upgrading the Yellow Light Sword to a mid-grade magic treasure."</p><p></p><p>He had already understood. The "Elder Meng Xun" they saw earlier was just an illusion!</p><p></p><p>The illusion formation manifested the thing they feared most in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>It just so happened that the two of them both feared Elder Meng Xun the most, so when the door opened, they saw Elder Meng Xun.</p><p></p><p>And behind Elder Meng Xun hid the Yellow Light Sword!</p><p></p><p>This could be considered a sure-kill move!</p><p></p><p>The cultivator Li guessed that the person behind the wooden house was Huang Li.</p><p></p><p>Now, the cultivator Li had an umbrella blocking in front of him, and took out a cyan long sword floating before himself, holding two talisman papers in his hand, staring fixedly ahead.</p><p></p><p>It could be seen that the cultivator Li was extremely tense.</p><p></p><p>The wooden door remained motionless, the surroundings completely silent. He could only smell the thick stench of blood, only see the headless corpse of the fat cultivator lying on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Huang, if you don't come out, then I, Li, will go in."</p><p></p><p>Mustering his courage, the cultivator Li said out loud, bravely walking towards the wooden house.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he wanted to go to the fat cultivator's side to take his storage bag, which contained Tranquility Talismans that could dispel illusions and allow him to...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>His body calmed down.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a cold and indifferent voice sounded from beside him: "Is Daoist Li looking for me, Huang?"</p><p></p><p>The Daoist surnamed Li's gaze flickered, looking towards the forest. </p><p></p><p>A figure walked out from the forest direction, that person wore a Daoist robe, was not very tall, had dark skin - it was Huang Li.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Huang has such a fiery temper. We only came to find you to discuss how to escape Lincheng. We didn't expect you to kill Daoist Liu with a single strike!"</p><p></p><p>The Daoist surnamed Li said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Huang Li gave a cold laugh: "Daoist Li, do you not know why you came to find me yourself?"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Huang Li walked towards the Daoist surnamed Li.</p><p></p><p>The Daoist surnamed Li's expression changed, he waved his finger, and a blue long sword blocked in front of him: "Brother Huang, it's better if you just stay there and talk!"</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Huang Li revealed a playful smile.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this playful smile, the Daoist surnamed Li immediately had a bad premonition.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>The Daoist surnamed Li gave a low cry, an intense crisis causing his hair to stand on end.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he realized that this Huang Li was definitely also just an illusion, not the real Huang Li!</p><p></p><p>"Pu--"</p><p></p><p>A sharp blade pierced into the lower back of the Daoist surnamed Li, the glinting sword blade made his head spin, the acute pain almost causing him to faint.</p><p></p><p>"Shameless little thief!"</p><p></p><p>The Daoist surnamed Li roared angrily, circulating all his inner energy, forcing that flying sword out of his body. He suddenly turned around, controlling his own flying sword to slash at the person behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Die! The Foundation Establishment Pill is mine!"</p><p></p><p>"All of you die!"</p><p></p><p>A familiar voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>The Daoist surnamed Li looked and saw the originally beheaded fat cultivator acting like a madman, controlling the flying sword that pierced his lower back.</p><p></p><p>That flying sword flew towards the Daoist surnamed Li again.</p><p></p><p>The Daoist surnamed Li's face changed greatly, he hurriedly used his flying sword to block the fat cultivator's attack, crying out: "Brother Liu, quickly wake up!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had already understood that everything he had seen just now was false!</p><p></p><p>All of it was an illusion!</p><p></p><p>What a terrifying illusion!</p><p></p><p>What kind of illusion was this, how could it be so realistic?</p><p></p><p>The Daoist surnamed Li exhausted all his efforts to fend off the fat cultivator's attacks, the wound on his lower back becoming more and more serious, a strong dizziness surging into his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Don't blame me, Brother Liu!"</p><p></p><p>The Daoist surnamed Li roared angrily, five energy channels simultaneously surging, circulating all his inner energy into that umbrella.</p><p></p><p>The umbrella rapidly spun, emitting rays of light.</p><p></p><p>Those rays of light fell on the fat cultivator's flying sword, and at this moment, the flying sword was actually fixed in mid-air, unable to move!</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the Daoist surnamed Li gritted his teeth, controlling the flying sword, the flying sword transformed into a stream of light, instantly striking the fat cultivator's body.</p><p></p><p>"Pu--"</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator's heart was pierced through by the sword, his eyes wide open as he fell stiffly to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Pu--" </p><p></p><p>After the Daoist surnamed Li exhausted all his efforts in that one strike, the inner energy in his body was also almost depleted, he fell powerlessly to the ground, and the wound on his lower back erupted at this moment.</p><p></p><p>A strong dizziness assailed him, and finally he collapsed to the ground, passing out.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how long had passed before the acute pain in his abdomen caused him to regain consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The Daoist surnamed Li suddenly opened his eyes, finding that he was still in front of that wooden hut, but his inner energy had completely dissipated!</p><p></p><p>In front of him was the fallen and deceased fat cultivator, but the fat cultivator's body was not dismembered, and there was no wound on his chest, only his eyes wide open, his expression one of horror, blood flowing from his mouth and nose!</p><p></p><p>Besides this, standing in front of him was a youth dressed in coarse linen clothes!</p><p></p><p>There will be one more chapter at 6pm, please support.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

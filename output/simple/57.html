        <h1>Chapter 57</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>His extraordinary innate ability, Zhou You had experienced it himself. </p><p></p><p>The "Keen Edge" innate ability could increase the quality of bladed weapons by one rank.</p><p></p><p>And now the "Demon Slayer" innate ability he obtained must not be inferior either.</p><p></p><p>[Woodcutting (100/100): A rather profound skill, practice it daily, and you will eventually succeed.]</p><p></p><p>[Woodcutting reached perfection, gained innate ability: Demon Slayer!]</p><p></p><p>[Demon Slayer: When attacking plant and wood-based demons, the golden talisman will emanate an oppressive aura, gradually increasing damage. Each attack can increase damage by 10%, stacking up to 10 times. After reaching maximum stacks, each attack has a chance to trigger the power of the golden talisman, dealing 5 times the damage!]</p><p></p><p>Looking at the three lines of text on the golden talisman, especially the last line, it stirred something in Zhou You's heart.</p><p></p><p>Increased damage against plant and wood-based demons?</p><p></p><p>It can stack up to 10 times?</p><p></p><p>This means that if he encounters plant or wood-based demons, after attacking 10 times, the damage he deals to them will be doubled!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there's even a chance to trigger the power of the golden talisman!</p><p></p><p>This innate ability is absolutely heaven-defying.</p><p></p><p>One must know, this ability can be used not only in the Qi Condensation realm but also in the Foundation Establishment, Core Formation, and even Nascent Soul realms!</p><p></p><p>He just didn't know if there would be similar innate abilities in the future that provide extra bonuses against beast-type enemies.</p><p></p><p>"Now it's basically confirmed that profound-level life skills can grant innate abilities. I wonder what kind of innate abilities [Planting] and [Cooking] will bring."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You tossed the axe aside and piled up all the firewood under the eaves. Looking at the surrounding wood, he couldn't help but let out a wry smile.</p><p></p><p>Over the past year, in order to improve his [Woodcutting] progress, the area around him was filled with stacks of firewood. He even built a shed specifically to store all this firewood.</p><p></p><p>Now that [Woodcutting] has reached perfection, his physical body has advanced to the Tempered Body 7th Layer, and he has gained the "Demon Slayer" innate ability, it's worth the perseverance he showed this past year.</p><p></p><p>Setting aside the woodcutting, Zhou You followed his routine and roasted two azure wood fish to eat first. No matter what, this thing could still increase his cultivation speed.</p><p></p><p>Eating two of them daily could increase his cultivation speed by one-sixth.</p><p></p><p>Over the past year, he had tried various ways to cook them, and eventually found that roasting them tasted the best.</p><p></p><p>However, sometimes, in order to improve his [Cooking] progress, he had no choice but to boil them.</p><p></p><p>After eating the roasted fish, Zhou You began drawing talismans.</p><p></p><p>Now, when drawing first-grade intermediate talismans, his success rate could reach around 80%. But for the first-grade superior Flame Burst Talisman, his success rate was only around 10%, with a progress of 10 points.</p><p></p><p>Improving the progress and success rate of the Flame Burst Talisman was relatively more difficult.</p><p></p><p>After all, once reaching first-grade superior talismans, the requirements for refining materials were much higher, needing demonic beast hides.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Zhou You had the golden talisman, so he believed that with another couple of months of practice, the success rate should reach 20-30%.</p><p></p><p>Generally, a 20% success rate was enough to break even.</p><p></p><p>After practicing and successfully drawing a Flame Burst Talisman, Zhou You did not continue. Instead, he began cultivating the Tempering Bone Manual.</p><p></p><p>With crackling sounds echoing from within his body, Zhou You's brows furrowed slightly as intense pain spread throughout his body. But with his current willpower, he could endure this torment.</p><p></p><p>His physical body was slowly advancing, progressing towards the Tempered Body 8th Layer.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating for two hours, Zhou You finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>For his current self, he could only persist for two hours. Two hours of tempering his bones was already the limit.</p><p></p><p>Continuing further would harm Zhou You's body and cause his consciousness to become hazy.</p><p></p><p>So Zhou You dared not take any more risks.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You exhaled deeply, then cleaned the sweat off his body, feeling refreshed and comfortable all over.</p><p></p><p>By this time, night had fallen. He went to the medicinal field and looked at the spiritually rich herbs.</p><p></p><p>After a year of growth, these spiritual herbs had matured to around four or five years old, enough to refine low-grade spirit pills.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>At the same time this year, Zhou You opened up several more medicinal fields. </p><p></p><p>Not long ago, Zhou You had already increased the number of Small Shocking Spirit Formations to thirty-two sets. Just as he had guessed before, the power of these Small Shocking Spirit Formations had greatly increased, from being able to trap cultivators at the ninth level of Qi Refining, to now being able to trap early Foundation Establishment cultivators!</p><p></p><p>This was the might of ancient formations!</p><p></p><p>Their concealing effect was also greatly enhanced. Even for a mid Foundation Establishment cultivator, unless they got close to the medicinal fields and carefully probed with their spiritual sense, they would be unable to detect these spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You also felt that although this formation seemed to allow unlimited stacking, the materials needed became too excessive later on, making the cost-effectiveness too low, so it might not be the best choice.</p><p></p><p>"I can try pill refining now."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You muttered to himself, deciding to start with the Talisman of Fasting Pills. He went to the medicinal fields to collect some herbs used for refining the Talisman of Fasting Pills, then returned to the wooden hut to begin pill refining.</p><p></p><p>The Talisman of Fasting Pill was a low-grade pill, very simple to refine. The pill formula was also a common one that could be easily purchased.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's current Primordial Spiritual Fire had reached 55 points, with the temperature already meeting the standard. However, his cultivation was only at the sixth level of Qi Refining, unable to sustain the use of the Primordial Spiritual Fire for long periods.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he could only temporarily start by refining the Talisman of Fasting Pills to practice.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You patted his inter-spatial bag and took out the first-grade superior Pill Furnace he had bought at the Huangshan Town market. He began heating the Pill Furnace using the Primordial Spiritual Fire according to the methods passed down from past pill masters.</p><p></p><p>Pill refining was divided into six steps: preheating, refining, fusion, condensing, nurturing, and opening the furnace.</p><p></p><p>During this process, the fire could not be extinguished, and one's spiritual sense had to remain focused within the Pill Furnace, observing the changes in the medicinal ingredients.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, pill refining also had certain requirements for the control of spiritual power and the strength of one's spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's spiritual sense strength was already stronger than ordinary ninth-level Qi Refining cultivators, and his control over spiritual power had reached the level of "pure green flame," giving him advantages in these areas.</p><p></p><p>"Open the furnace!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You raised his hand and pointed, opening the Pill Furnace that had been heated until red-hot. He then threw all the medicinal herbs into the Pill Furnace.</p><p></p><p>The Talisman of Fasting Pill only required five kinds of herbs, making it relatively easy to refine.</p><p></p><p>Soon, under the heating of the Primordial Spiritual Fire, the five herbs quickly melted into a pool of medicinal liquid.</p><p></p><p>Next, Zhou You began controlling the fusion of these liquids.</p><p></p><p>But after only a dozen or so breaths, Zhou You frowned as he noticed the liquids rapidly becoming muddled, with the spiritual power within starting to conflict.</p><p></p><p>"Failed."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You waved his hand, opening the lid of the Pill Furnace. A puff of mist dispersed out, and the medicinal liquids also flew out, landing in a container nearby.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You then carefully recalled the situation, quickly determining that the failure was due to his own impatience. The order of fusing the herbs was correct, but the intervals between each fusion were too short.</p><p></p><p>The first two herbs had not fully fused, their spiritual powers had not completely merged, before he hastily tried to fuse the next liquid.</p><p></p><p>Pill refining was something that favored a slow and steady pace, not haste.</p><p></p><p>He could not rush!</p><p></p><p>After understanding the issue, Zhou You took a deep breath and began pill refining again.</p><p></p><p>The five herbs flew into the furnace and quickly melted. Zhou You learned from his mistake and fused the five liquids in succession.</p><p></p><p>This time there were no errors in the fusion stage, but he failed during the condensing stage.</p><p></p><p>The second attempt at pill refining was declared a failure.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You did not become discouraged. He continued analyzing the reasons, then began his third attempt at pill refining.</p><p></p><p>The third attempt seemed to proceed smoothly. Finally, it reached the nurturing stage, with strands of blue life force emanating from the Primordial Spiritual Fire and fusing into the pill, slowly nurturing it.</p><p></p><p>The nurturing stage took the longest time and was the most test of patience. </p><p></p><p>During this period, there could be no disturbances, and the fire temperature could not be too high or too low.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Talisman of Fasting Pill was quite simple, only requiring the time of one incense stick to complete the nurturing stage.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

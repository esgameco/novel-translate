        <h1>Chapter 35</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>In the nearest market outside of the Taibai Academy, it was still that inn, and those two cultivators, one fat and one thin.</p><p></p><p>After setting up restrictive spells, the two began communicating. </p><p></p><p>"Brother Li! What's going on? There's still half a month until the Taibai Academy's grand competition, why has their security become even tighter?"</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator exclaimed in surprise, his fleshy face jiggling.</p><p></p><p>The thin cultivator named Li had a pointed mouth and sunken cheeks. A sharp gleam flashed in his eyes: "Brother Liu, we cultivators must not be rash. Rest assured, the Taibai Academy will definitely let down their guard half a month later. By then, with our concealment talismans, we can easily sneak into the academy."</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator still seemed unconvinced: "I have a bad feeling about this!"</p><p></p><p>Cultivator Li snorted coldly: "Brother Liu, you worry too much. We have the concealment talismans bestowed by our senior. Those below the seventh level of qi cultivation cannot possibly detect us. And those fish servants are all first level cultivators. What is there to worry about?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Li's words, the fat cultivator finally settled down a bit.</p><p></p><p>Then Li said: "Brother Liu, you should know how important the treasure Huang Li has obtained is. If you and I can find that thing, we can get the Foundation Establishment Pills promised by our senior. Those are Foundation Establishment Pills!"</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator's eyes flickered with desire, putting aside his previous concerns.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Liu, this is our chance. If we don't seize it, we'll never have a hope of establishing our foundations in this life!"</p><p></p><p>Pausing, Li added: "And I've heard that many cultivators have already found out that after fleeing, Huang Li went to the shores of Erhai Lake. He must have gone to find those fish servants. If we don't hurry, others may beat us to it, and our efforts will be wasted!"</p><p></p><p>Now the fat cultivator grew anxious. "Then we must move quickly! These few days, let's keep circling around. As soon as we notice the Taibai Academy's defenses slacken even a bit, we'll take action!"</p><p></p><p>Li revealed a slight smile and nodded.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhou You was unaware of the impending calamity the fish servants would face.</p><p></p><p>He was still grinding the Golden Light Sword in his hands.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Light Sword was a low-grade magic weapon containing restrictive spells. Initially Zhou You was afraid grinding it might break those spells, but after such a long time, whether due to his Grinding skill or because grinding simply didn't damage the sword's spells, he realized it was fine.</p><p></p><p>Since he couldn't damage the restrictive spells, Zhou You naturally grew bolder and continued grinding the Golden Light Sword.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, as the sun dipped west, dyeing Erhai Lake orange, Zhou You wiped his brow and finally stopped grinding.</p><p></p><p>"It really has improved!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's eyes flickered with pleasant surprise as he looked at the cold gleam shining from the Golden Light Sword.</p><p></p><p>After half a day's grinding, he could clearly sense the sword had grown much sharper, and its quality had slightly improved as well.</p><p></p><p>Though the improvement wasn't huge, Zhou You's powerful divine sense and extremely sharp six senses allowed him to perceive the slight upgrade.</p><p></p><p>The "Keen Edge" trait really did have an effect.</p><p></p><p>If he could upgrade this sword to a mid-grade magic weapon...then the "Keen Edge" effect would be heaven-defying!</p><p></p><p>Cultivators at the Qi Condensation stage used magic weapons of low, middle, high and peak grades. Those who established their foundation used spirit weapons of the same four grades. And after forming their nascent soul...supposedly they used magic treasures.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I can slowly improve the quality of this Golden Light Sword over time. Hopefully one day I can upgrade it to a mid-grade magic weapon!"</p><p></p><p>With a shift of his divine sense, Zhou You channeled his spiritual power into the Golden Light Sword, instantly enlarging it into a seven-foot saber.</p><p></p><p>He swung it at a large boulder nearby.</p><p></p><p>With a "puhh" sound, the boulder split cleanly in two, the cut surface smooth as silk, displaying the Golden Light Sword's sharpness.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You waved his hand, and the sword flew back, emitting a soft hum.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, its sharpness surpasses even those..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Even a top-grade low-rank magic weapon is not to be underestimated. If it could be upgraded to a mid-rank magic weapon, its power would definitely rise to another level."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You put away the yellow light sword with satisfaction, carrying those two stones as he turned and went back into the wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The weather gradually turned cool, and just half a month later, winter had arrived, leaving the area around Erhai Lake desolate. </p><p></p><p>More and more sword lights appeared in the sky. The disciples of Taibai Academy, who were rarely seen normally, now seemed to swarm out like bees, visible in the sky at all times.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You also understood that Taibai Academy's annual grand competition had begun.</p><p></p><p>It was during this period.</p><p></p><p>It was said that this annual grand competition would last about ten days. The academy tested many subjects, whether it was theories of cultivation, or various skills like pill refining, formation setting, weapon forging, talisman making, and so on.</p><p></p><p>It was even said that they would test fishing for spirit fish.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the most important was still martial arts combat. </p><p></p><p>This item carried the highest weight and was the one that most academy disciples paid the most attention to.</p><p></p><p>"Feels a bit like exams from a previous life."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You shook his head, gathered his thoughts, and continued doing his own thing.</p><p></p><p>Soon it was night, and the sword lights in the sky had finally disappeared. All was quiet, the night was dark and windy. Zhou You practiced the newly learned 'Eight Extremities Collapse' in the wooden hut, his movements precise and proper.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, forty li away from Zhou You, outside the fishermen's quarters, two figures, one fat and one thin, sneaked up close.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li, this is the fishermen's quarters!" The fat cultivator used a voice transmission technique to speak to the thin cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The thin cultivator nodded, "Correct. These fishermen have only cultivated to the first level of qi refining. Their spirit and soul are no different from ordinary people, they don't even have spiritual sense. With our fifth level of qi refining, dealing with them will be like ants. After infiltrating, we'll directly use the soul controlling technique."</p><p></p><p>These two figures, one fat and one thin, were the same Liu surnamed cultivator and Li surnamed cultivator who had previously been staking out the market near Taibai Academy!</p><p></p><p>"Use the soul controlling technique? But...once we use that technique, they will definitely suffer spirit damage and become idiots." The fat cultivator said with some reluctance.</p><p></p><p>The Li cultivator said, "Brother Liu, are they even human? In the Righteous Alliance, these so-called fishermen are just pigs. What's there to pity? We should hurry and take action to complete the mission."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator was convinced by the Li cultivator. The two infiltrated a room, using stealth talismans. With their fifth level of qi refining cultivation, the fishermen inside the room had no way to detect them sneaking in.</p><p></p><p>Coming up to the bed, the Li cultivator unhesitatingly used his soul controlling technique, his spiritual sense drilling into the sea of consciousness of the fisherman wearing a coarse cloth robe, instantly controlling him.</p><p></p><p>The fisherman opened his eyes, his gaze dull as he sat up in the darkness like a puppet.</p><p></p><p>"What's your name?" The Li cultivator asked in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Wang Qiang," the fisherman replied woodenly.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me everything about Huang Li."</p><p></p><p>The Li cultivator didn't waste time on useless chatter, going straight to the point.</p><p></p><p>The fisherman paused for a moment before beginning to answer, telling them everything he knew about Huang Li, including Taibai Academy's investigation into Huang Li.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no information that the Li cultivator and his companion wanted.</p><p></p><p>"Useless!" The Li cultivator cursed softly, withdrawing his soul controlling technique and leaving.</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator glanced back at the fisherman with some reluctance. The fisherman remained dull-faced, his gaze blank, having soiled himself from incontinence and giving off a foul odor.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if this Light and Shadow Sword technique can harm cultivators at the Qi Refining 2nd Level?" </p><p></p><p>Zhou You muttered to himself as he gently stroked the iron sword.</p><p></p><p>He had some understanding of the strength of the Qi Refining 1st Level, after all he himself was also at the 1st Level.</p><p></p><p>But as for the Qi Refining 2nd Level, Zhou You was not familiar with it. Combined with the fact that the Light and Shadow Sword technique itself was just a mortal sword manual, whether it could pose a threat to 2nd Level Qi Refining cultivators was an unknown.</p><p></p><p>Based on Zhou You's guess, it should pose a threat.</p><p></p><p>Although the Light and Shadow Sword technique was a mortal sword manual, and its usage requirements were extremely stringent, needing extremely strong reflexes and spiritual power to capture the changes in light and shadows, borrowing the instantaneous changes to unleash the moves, achieving the effects of using the false to disrupt the true and striking by surprise.</p><p></p><p>But its might was far greater and more practical than ordinary sword techniques.  </p><p></p><p>Success or failure hung on an instant.</p><p></p><p>If used well, perhaps it could truly threaten 2nd Level Qi Refining cultivators!</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, another three days passed. </p><p></p><p>This was already the 50th day of Zhou You's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>On this morning, he finished his morning cultivation as usual.</p><p></p><p>He was just about to get up and eat something, then start his day's busy work.</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, the golden seal in his consciousness flickered incessantly.</p><p></p><p>On Zhou You's right arm, a golden meridian channel appeared, and a large amount of spiritual qi surged into the meridians of his right arm.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, that golden meridian channel condensed into form, another meridian channel was formed!</p><p></p><p>"Qi Refining 2nd Level!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's eyes flashed with some excitement.  </p><p></p><p>He inwardly observed the line of words on the golden seal.</p><p></p><p>[Opening the Meridians Scripture - First Part (50/100): A basic cultivation technique, exhaling and inhaling daily can increase 1 progress, completing it in 100 days!]</p><p></p><p>20 progress for Qi Refining 1st Level.</p><p></p><p>50 progress for Qi Refining 2nd Level!</p><p></p><p>Then 100 progress should be Qi Refining 3rd Level.</p><p></p><p>It turned out to be about the same as Zhou You's guess.</p><p></p><p>The Opening the Meridians Scripture he obtained was only the first part, at most allowing him to cultivate to the Qi Refining 3rd Level. So cultivating to the perfect Realized realm should be the Qi Refining 3rd Level.</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed his guess was not wrong.  </p><p></p><p>Zhou You could feel the spiritual power roaming within his body was at least three times stronger than before!</p><p></p><p>For each level of the Qi Refining realm, the increase was a qualitative leap.</p><p></p><p>Now that Zhou You's cultivation had reached the Qi Refining 2nd Level, he had gained another means of self-defense, and was one step closer to the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You also knew that at this speed, he was considered extremely fast for the entire Qi Refining period.</p><p></p><p>Take Huang Li for example, it took him three years just to reach the Qi Refining 1st Level.</p><p></p><p>"Once I reach Foundation Establishment, I can remove the soul imprint left on me by the Xiao Family. After that, I'll be free as a bird soaring in the sky."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You smiled, feeling the spiritual power in his meridian channels, his mood quite good.</p><p></p><p>Servant disciples of cultivator clans all had soul imprints left by the main family within their bodies.</p><p></p><p>These soul imprints would not harm the servant disciples, only serving as a mark. One only needed to scan it with their spiritual sense to know which clan's servant they were.</p><p></p><p>Similar to the brands burned onto the faces of mortal slaves.</p><p></p><p>However, once their cultivation reached the Foundation Establishment realm, the soul imprint would automatically dissipate, and the servant disciple would gain freedom.</p><p></p><p>As long as Zhou You cultivated steadily, reaching Foundation Establishment was only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After cleaning himself of dirt, Zhou You ate a simple meal of noodles, then started tending to his vegetables.</p><p></p><p>The newly planted vegetable seeds had already sprouted. Since it had only been three days since planting, he couldn't yet see which seedlings were growing faster. He could only wait a while longer.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You finished tending to them, then came to the shores of Erhai Lake and once again started...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He started fishing.</p><p></p><p>In the meantime, when Huang Li was bored, he came over to chat with Zhou You again. </p><p></p><p>It was quite obvious that when Huang Li saw Zhou You, his eyes seemed a bit strange, and he couldn't help but look at him a few more times.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhou, you look more and more spiritually radiant these days."</p><p></p><p>Huang Li said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You felt that Huang Li had an ulterior motive in his words, trying to attack him from the side, but found that Huang Li didn't follow up on that, but instead started complaining about his own main family again.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Huang Li complained more and more, constantly grumbling about the young master of the Huo family.</p><p></p><p>Every time, Zhou You just listened silently, rarely expressing his opinion.</p><p></p><p>Today was no exception for Huang Li, who continued to grumble about the young master of the Huo family as usual.</p><p></p><p>Only Zhou You felt it was a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>He rarely responded to Huang Li's complaints, basically it was just Huang Li talking to himself, so it could be said that Zhou You kept a certain distance from Huang Li.</p><p></p><p>However, Huang Li still came to chat with Zhou You every day.</p><p></p><p>He kept trying to get close to Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>This raised a sense of vigilance in Zhou You's heart.</p><p></p><p>Combining Huang Li's previous behavior, Zhou You felt that Huang Li was a bit abnormal, giving Zhou You the feeling of being overly enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You thought that for someone he had just met, a stranger, he couldn't be so enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>There's a saying that goes, "One should not have malicious intentions, but one cannot be without vigilance."</p><p></p><p>Of course, during this period, Zhou You also obtained a lot of information about the cultivation world from Huang Li.</p><p></p><p>Such as the power dynamics in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Lincheng is one of the ten major continents in the great cultivation world, located in the extreme southwest of the southern continent. Further south are the Ten Thousand Great Mountains, filled with countless demonic beasts. Lincheng can be considered the first line of defense against the demon race.</p><p></p><p>The Taibai Academy is the largest cultivation force in Lincheng and the official cultivation institution of the Great Qi Dynasty, used to recruit commoners who wish to cultivate. As long as one has spiritual roots, they can enter the Taibai Academy for cultivation after passing the test.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there are three cultivation aristocratic families, two cultivation sects, and one organization of scattered cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The three cultivation aristocratic families are the Lin, Ye, and Wu families, all of which have cultivators at the Condensed Pellet realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the cultivation sects, they are the Taixuan Sect and the Yulin Mountain Villa.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the organization of scattered cultivators is called the Upright Qi Alliance, a gathering place for scattered cultivators in Lincheng where they help each other out. Although they don't live as well as the disciples of sects and aristocratic families, they're still doing quite well.</p><p></p><p>It's said that the Upright Qi Alliance is very willing to help those who were servants from aristocratic families and wish to cultivate, as well as those who failed to enter the Taibai Academy and ordinary spiritual root holders who haven't opened their meridians.</p><p></p><p>It's said that Zhao Bin went to the Upright Qi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Because the Upright Qi Alliance still has some reputation in Lincheng, the main branch of the Xiao family in the southern continent couldn't do anything about it.</p><p></p><p>Every time Huang Li mentioned the Upright Qi Alliance, he was full of longing and excitement, his desire to join them almost written on his face.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You would just silently take note of these things every time.</p><p></p><p>After another ten days passed, it was time for the second delivery of spiritual fish. This time, Zhou You handed in ninety-five spiritual fish.</p><p></p><p>Still five short of Xiao Yueyingâ€™s requirement.</p><p></p><p>But from Xiao Qing, he learned that Xiao Yueying was not angry, but instead praised Zhou You, making Zhou You guess that perhaps Zhao Bin couldnâ€™t even hand in ninety before.</p><p></p><p>When leaving Xiao Yueyingâ€™s small courtyard this time, Zhou You got twenty spiritual sand.</p><p></p><p>On the way, he sold five spiritual fish at the inner market, totaling twenty-five spiritual sand. Added to the previous amount, it reached thirty-nine, close to half a spiritual stone.</p><p></p><p>However, Xiao Yueyingâ€™s generosity left Zhou You puzzled.</p><p></p><p>He learned from Huang Li that the young master of the Huo family gave at most three spiritual sand each time, while Xiao Yueying seemed much more generous!</p><p></p><p>He didnâ€™t know whether this was a good or bad thing.</p>

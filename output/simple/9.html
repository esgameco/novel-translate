        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Zhou You paused his movements, staring intently at Huang Li. </p><p></p><p>Actually, before this Zhou You had inquired about Zhao Bin's disappearance, but Huang Li had always avoided the topic. Today, however, he suddenly brought it up.</p><p></p><p>"I hope Brother Huang can provide some guidance."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You cupped his hands in a polite gesture.</p><p></p><p>Huang Li hesitated for a moment, then after a while sighed and continued: "There's no other reason, it's simply that the major cultivating clans exploit us too much. Zhao Bin practiced for several months but found his cultivation made not the slightest bit of progress, so...he ran away!"</p><p></p><p>"Ran away?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was stunned for a moment. </p><p></p><p>This result was somewhat unexpected for him. Zhou You had originally thought Zhao Bin may have failed to complete Xiao Yue Ying's task, resulting in his cultivation being crippled and him being abandoned somewhere to fend for himself. </p><p></p><p>Or it was also possible he was harmed by someone.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that he had actually run away himself?</p><p></p><p>If this was truly the case, then it made sense why Xiao Yue Ying gifted him ten spirit pills - was it because she was afraid Zhou You would run away too?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You asked doubtfully, "But he didn't remove his slave mark. The soul imprint is still on his body. Although the imprint won't harm him, no matter where he goes, people will know he's a servant of the Xiao clan!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Li didn't respond, only saying, "Brother Zhou, I'm not speaking nonsense here. If you ask any of the nearby fishermen servants, they all clearly know the truth of this matter. Previously I didn't understand you, so I didn't dare speak of it."</p><p></p><p>Erhai Lake is vast, but most of the young masters' fishermen servants are concentrated within a hundred li radius. </p><p></p><p>Huang Li lived just ten li north of Zhou You, so they were practically neighbors.</p><p></p><p>So as long as one made an effort, it wasn't difficult to investigate the reason for Zhao Bin's disappearance.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You nodded silently.</p><p></p><p>Huang Li gave a wry smile and took a drink of alcohol. "With this level of exploitation, we can barely get any cultivation time each day. It takes me three years just to condense one layer of qi, the Nascent Soul stage is hopelessly far away. Who can endure this?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You continued nodding.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, it was true. </p><p></p><p>Almost all the spiritual power they cultivated each day was drained away by the spirit fish, leaving no spare time for actual practice.</p><p></p><p>If they weren't given any hope it would be better, but instead they were given hope only to be made despondent - this was the most cruel thing.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was better off, having the Tao of Simplicity golden imprint, allowing him to catch two more spirit fish per day than others and giving him plenty of time to explore the imprint's capabilities.</p><p></p><p>Huang Li sighed, "Brother Zhou, you've just arrived so you don't feel this despair yet, but you'll understand later on. Let's not talk about this anymore, let's just drink."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After drinking with Huang Li that night, everything returned to normal. </p><p></p><p>Huang Li never mentioned that night's events to Zhou You again, as if they had never happened.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You also repeated his daily routine.</p><p></p><p>Each morning he would perform his regular cultivation, then after finishing he would water his vegetables before starting to fish for spirit fish.</p><p></p><p>The vegetables Zhou You planted were now edible, so he cleared another plot to experiment on why the vegetables grew so quickly.</p><p></p><p>He watered some with water from Erhai Lake, and some with stream water from three li away.</p><p></p><p>Then he would observe if there was any difference in their growth rates, to determine if it was indeed the lake water causing the accelerated growth cycle.</p><p></p><p>On regular days, he also thought about how to obtain more spirit pills.</p><p></p><p>More than ten days ago when he turned in his spirit fish, Zhou You only submitted eighty fish, but that month he had actually caught a total of 145.</p><p></p><p>Which meant after turning them in, Zhou You still had 65 spirit fish remaining in his fish pouch.</p><p></p><p>This was no small fortune.</p><p></p><p>If he took them all to the inner sect to sell, he could even get a spirit stone!</p><p></p><p>One spirit fish could roughly be exchanged for two spirit pills.</p><p></p><p>Fifty spirit fish could get him one spirit stone.</p><p></p><p>But Zhou You was well aware that this was extremely dangerous. If he dared to do this, the next day he would definitely...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It would spread to Xiao Yueying's ears. </p><p></p><p>And he would be closely watched by many people with ill intentions.</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation world, the weak are prey for the strong. Taibai Academy is no sanctuary - he is merely a servant. Even if he was harmed, it would not cause any stir. </p><p></p><p>So out of the sixty-five spiritual fish, Zhou You only sold two, obtaining four spirit sands.</p><p></p><p>Adding the ones gifted by Xiao Yueying, he had a total of fourteen spirit sands in all.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if eating the earth-attribute spiritual fish could increase my spiritual power?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You pondered secretly. </p><p></p><p>He had too many spiritual fish. Even if he handed in a hundred per month as required, he could still keep fifty.</p><p></p><p>Of those fifty, at most he could only sell ten.</p><p></p><p>Any more and it would draw attention, which would be dangerous.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't just leave so many spiritual fish unattended either.</p><p></p><p>He had to find a way to get rid of them.</p><p></p><p>Eating them was one method, but he couldn't eat two every day, could he?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if eating them had no effect, it would be a terrible waste.</p><p></p><p>It would be better not to catch them at all.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You couldn't think of a solution for now. He could only go to the fish keeper, take two spiritual fish, kill and clean them before bringing them back to roast and eat.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a rather fragrant aroma wafted out.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had never roasted fish before. He could only roast it properly based on his memory, sprinkling some salt once it was cooked enough to eat.</p><p></p><p>However, before Zhou You could start eating, he felt the golden seal in his consciousness flashing brightly.</p><p></p><p>Then a line of words appeared:</p><p></p><p>[Roasting Fish (2/100): A rather complex skill, roast one hundred fish to master it.]</p><p></p><p>Seeing these words, Zhou You's expression didn't change much.</p><p></p><p>He had expected the golden seal to record roasting fish as a skill.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Zhou You was a bit puzzled - if roasting fish could become a skill, why couldn't cooking?</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it has to do with the ingredients. I'm roasting spiritual fish now. Maybe if I braise a spiritual fish tomorrow, the golden seal will record cooking as a skill too."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You guessed.</p><p></p><p>As he pondered, he took a bite of the roasted fish.</p><p></p><p>The roasted fish could only be described as edible, without much flavor.</p><p></p><p>But the fish meat was extremely tender and fresh. Even though it was a bit charred, the inside was still very tender.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You quickly finished the two spiritual fish.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy from the fish began to spread, but it wasn't much.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You checked the golden seal and found that the Scripture of Meridian Opening didn't react.</p><p></p><p>No effect?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You frowned slightly and shook his head, "Let me try for a while longer."</p><p></p><p>After dealing with the fish bones, Zhou You rested for a bit before picking up his rusty sword to practice the Light and Shadow Sword Art.</p><p></p><p>An hour later, Zhou You was drenched in sweat and panting as he stopped.</p><p></p><p>The golden seal in his consciousness flickered, and a line of text appeared:</p><p></p><p>[Light and Shadow Sword Art (54/100): A very simple sword art, practice five times a day for thirty days to master!]</p><p></p><p>The progress of the Light and Shadow Sword Art reached 54, about half a month away from mastering it.</p><p></p><p>He would definitely gain a lot of benefits once he did.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked forward to it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Zhou You found himself becoming more and more familiar with this sword art.</p><p></p><p>Previously, practicing the full set took him half an hour.</p><p></p><p>But now he could practice it five times in just one hour!</p><p></p><p>With Zhou You's extremely fast reflexes and mental strength, he wielded this Light and Shadow Sword Art like a fish in water.</p><p></p><p>He was confident he could bring out its full potential!</p>

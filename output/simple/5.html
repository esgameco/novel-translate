        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Very soon, Zhou You adjusted the float, let out some more line, and cast a few more times before continuing to fish.</p><p></p><p>This time there was still no movement. </p><p></p><p>After trying a few more times and spending a full three hours, Zhou You finally got a bite.</p><p></p><p>"It's finally here!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's spirit lifted, gripping the fishing rod tightly and beginning to reel it in.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual fish was extremely powerful. Even with Zhou You's strength being a notch above ordinary people, he still found it quite taxing. </p><p></p><p>The feeling Zhou You got was that the fish under the lake surface must weigh at least ten jin (around 11 lbs)!</p><p></p><p>The fishing rod bent instantly, the line stretched taut!</p><p></p><p>Now Zhou You understood why only cultivators could fish for spiritual fish.</p><p></p><p>Just in terms of strength alone, ordinary people would find it hard to match these spiritual fish.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no!"</p><p></p><p>After persisting for not long, Zhou You's hand slipped and he fell backward - the spiritual fish got away!</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You exhaled, quickly casting again with fresh bait after the mishap.</p><p></p><p>One failure did not dishearten Zhou You. </p><p></p><p>He had anticipated that these spiritual fish would not be so easy to catch.</p><p></p><p>He was just a beginner, he could only slowly put in the time.</p><p></p><p>As his proficiency increased, his success rate would naturally rise.</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully I can catch enough one hundred before the end of the month."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You stared at the lake surface, thinking inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yueyingave him the task of submitting one hundred spiritual fish per month, otherwise he would lose his cultivation and have to start over with someone new.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Zhou You had to make haste.</p><p></p><p>After half a stick of incense's time, the line moved again.</p><p></p><p>This time Zhou You was even more careful.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he slowly reeled in the spiritual fish. But just as it was about to break the surface, an immense force rippled out. Zhou You's heart jolted and he instinctively circulated the Kai Mai Jue scripture.</p><p></p><p>All his strength gathered in his arms.</p><p></p><p>A miraculous power flowed out from the meridians in his arms onto the fishing rod.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Zhou You felt his arms had the strength of a thousand jun!</p><p></p><p>With one pull, he directly hauled the spiritual fish out!</p><p></p><p>A palm-sized spiritual fish landed on the shore.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was dazed - the spiritual fish was only palm-sized?</p><p></p><p>Initially he thought it must weigh over ten jin, but...no more than one jin!</p><p></p><p>Recalling the force the spiritual fish unleashed as it neared the surface, if not for the miraculous power released from his meridians, an ordinary person would likely have been dragged into Lake Er.</p><p></p><p>That miraculous power must be the unique inner force of cultivators!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had not formally started cultivation yet, so the trace of inner force born within him was imperceptible, only forcibly unleashed in that kind of situation.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps upon reaching the first level of Qi cultivation, he would be able to sense the inner force within.</p><p></p><p>No wonder they say only cultivators can fish for spiritual fish. Without inner force, even when nearly reeled in, all efforts would ultimately be wasted.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the golden talisman "Dao Zhi Jian" in Zhou You's consciousness shone brilliantly.</p><p></p><p>A line of text appeared:</p><p></p><p>[Fishing Spiritual Fish: First Low-Grade (1/100) - A rather complex subject, but not too profound. Five catches a day, mastered in twenty days!]</p><p></p><p>First low-grade spiritual fish?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You picked up the spiritual fish. It was lively, resembling an ordinary carp but infused with spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"It seems there are different grades of spiritual fish, perhaps mid and high-grade as well."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You mused, putting the spiritual fish into a special container.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>And so, Zhou You settled down in this area.</p><p></p><p>Since Lake Er was so vast, and there were only so many cultivators from Taibai Academy, the powerful cultivators could usually complete their tasks in just a few hours.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The task quota for the month was difficult to achieve.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it was rare to see anyone else around Lake Erhai. </p><p></p><p>Zhou You had lived here for twenty days, but hadn't seen another person.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You actually enjoyed the tranquility. </p><p></p><p>On this morning, Zhou You practiced cultivation as usual.</p><p></p><p>Two hours later, the cultivation ended.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a fluctuation of spiritual power came from within his body, and the spiritual energy around also became unstable.</p><p></p><p>A golden vein appeared on Zhou You's left arm.</p><p></p><p>That vein was extremely condensed and emanated a mysterious aura.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You could sense that a powerful force was being released from the golden vein, rapidly cleansing his body!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhou You keenly felt that his hearing, vision, and sense of smell had greatly improved!</p><p></p><p>He could clearly hear the crickets chirping outside the house.</p><p></p><p>Looking out the window towards Lake Erhai and the snowy mountains in the distance, everything appeared much clearer.</p><p></p><p>The whole world seemed renewed!</p><p></p><p>"That must be the power of cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's heart stirred, feeling slightly excited.</p><p></p><p>After the spiritual power circulated through his body, it returned to the golden vein, which quickly disappeared and faded, and everything returned to calm!</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation Base Level One!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's eyes flickered, he took a deep breath, feeling quite excited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After twenty days of bitter cultivation, he finally reached the first level of the Cultivation Base!</p><p></p><p>It meant he had truly begun cultivating and crossed the threshold into the cultivation world!</p><p></p><p>He could also clearly feel the spiritual power in his meridians.</p><p></p><p>Although it wasn't immense, at least he could sense the power of spiritual energy!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked down at himself, his whole body covered in black grime, giving off a foul odor.</p><p></p><p>It was clearly the impurities expelled from his body when the spiritual power cleansed him upon breaking through to the first level of the Cultivation Base.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You took a set of clothes and went outside to wash himself clean in Lake Erhai. He clearly felt much stronger.</p><p></p><p>Looking at his reflection on the lake's surface, his previously sallow, malnourished complexion now had a rosy glow, his skin smoother, and his appearance more handsome.</p><p></p><p>After changing into a set of clothes and eating something, he went to check on the vegetable garden, watered the plants, and only then returned to the shore to continue fishing for spiritual fish.</p><p></p><p>After casting his line, the bored Zhou You looked at the information within the Golden Talisman "The Way of Simplicity."</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the progress of the "Opening the Meridians Scripture: Volume I" had reached 20%, which allowed him to break through to the first level of the Cultivation Base!</p><p></p><p>This confirmed Zhou You's conjecture.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that after the progress reaches a certain level, a meridian will condense, and the cultivation base will advance!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You thought silently: "I only obtained the first volume of the 'Opening the Meridians Scripture,' so I can only condense three meridians. It seems that when the progress reaches 100%, I should be able to condense the third meridian, which is the third level of the Cultivation Base!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>More than ten minutes later, Zhou You caught a spiritual fish.</p><p></p><p>After fifteen days of fishing, Zhou You had caught more than seventy spiritual fish.</p><p></p><p>Only a quarter remained until he met the quota of one hundred fish per month!</p><p></p><p>At Zhou You's pace of catching one spiritual fish every ten minutes or so, generally speaking, as long as he applied himself, he could catch one hundred fish in just one day.</p><p></p><p>However, if he fished for more than five fish per day, his whole body would become weak. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't catch any more spiritual fish.</p><p></p><p>This was also why disciples from cultivating clans were unwilling to waste time fishing.</p><p></p><p>Fishing for spiritual fish consumed a certain amount of spiritual power. Lower-level cultivators only had so much spiritual power in their bodies, and once it was expended, they needed a period of breathing exercises to recover.</p><p></p><p>This would greatly hinder their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Zhou You had the Golden Talisman "The Way of Simplicity," so he only needed to cultivate for two hours each day, which was equivalent to dozens of days of bitter cultivation for an ordinary low-grade spiritual root. This left him with plenty of spare time each day, so he didn't mind taking the time to recover his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Is anyone reading this? Follows are really important for a new book!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

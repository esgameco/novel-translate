        <h1>Chapter 40</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Zhou You began to take stock of those spoils of war. </p><p></p><p>Very soon, all the spoils were neatly categorized and placed byZhou You.</p><p></p><p>First were the magic treasures used by the fat and thin cultivators - two flying swords and one rain umbrella. </p><p></p><p>The two flying swords were both mid-grade magic treasures. A low-grade magic treasure costs one hundred spirit stones, while a mid-grade one costs at least three hundred spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>Just these were worth six hundred spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention there was also a top-notch mid-grade magic treasure rain umbrella. The quality of this umbrella was obviously better than the two flying swords, and it combined offense and defense, making it even more valuable!</p><p></p><p>Previously,Zhou You had seen the thin cultivator activate this umbrella, emanating a hazy light that could restrain the fat cultivator's flying sword.</p><p></p><p>Able to control the opponent's magic treasure, this was no ordinary treasure.</p><p></p><p>Naturally,Zhou You had no intention of selling this treasure, but chose to use it himself.</p><p></p><p>Carefully examining the umbrella handle, Zhou You saw the three characters "Hua Luo Umbrella" written on it.</p><p></p><p>"It's a treasure, I'll keep it for now."</p><p></p><p>Putting away the Hua Luo Umbrella,Zhou You then turned his attention to the two flying swords.</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator's sword had no attributes. Zhou You planned to first grind and upgrade it to a high-grade magic treasure before selling it.</p><p></p><p>A high-grade magic treasure was worth at least one thousand spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>Now Zhou You could confirm that the "Sharp Edge" characteristic could upgrade the quality of a flying sword or knife-type magic treasure by one level, but only once. After over half a month of grinding, his Yellow Light Sword had been upgraded to a mid-grade magic treasure.</p><p></p><p>However, in terms of sharpness alone, this upgraded magic treasure far surpassed treasures of the same grade!</p><p></p><p>As for the thin cultivator's blue flying sword, after examining it, Zhou You discovered it was surprisingly a wood-attribute flying sword. His wood-attribute spirit power controlling the sword gave it an advantage.</p><p></p><p>"Qing Ying Sword!"</p><p></p><p>"This sword is good! Excelling in speed, if the Sharp Edge characteristic is used to grind and upgrade it to a high-grade magic treasure, it will absolutely be a formidable weapon!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's eyes flickered as he was quite satisfied putting away the Qing Ying Sword.</p><p></p><p>A high-grade magic treasure was the type used by late Qi Refining cultivators. If Zhou You could possess one, it would be an immense boost for him.</p><p></p><p>"Those who commit fraud really make a lot of money to even obtain so many mid-grade magic treasures."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>Mid-grade magic treasures were worth around three hundred spirit stones each. For a mid Qi Refining cultivator at the fourth to sixth level of Qi Refining, honestly earning spirit stones, it might take ten years to obtain them.</p><p></p><p>But now they had all become Zhou You's cheap gains.</p><p></p><p>Putting away all the magic treasures, Zhou You then counted the spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>The fat and thin cultivators had a total of one hundred and eighty-eight spirit stones between them.</p><p></p><p>It was a considerable fortune, but the amount was less thanZhou You expected, it should have been more.</p><p></p><p>The rest were just some miscellaneous spirit pills.</p><p></p><p>"Essence Absorbing Pills? There were actually twenty-one of these spirit pills suitable for mid Qi Refining cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>Holding the spirit pills, Zhou You was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Like the Foundation Establishing Pills, Essence Absorbing Pills were used to increase one's cultivation. Each pill cost thirty low-grade spirit stones, so these twenty-one were worth six hundred and thirty low-grade spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>No wonder the fat and thin cultivators didn't have many spirit stones in their pockets, it seemed they had spent it all buying cultivation spirit pills.</p><p></p><p>As for why they didn't consume the spirit pills for increasing their cultivation,Zhou You could understand.</p><p></p><p>According to the travel journal, ordinary wandering cultivators would usually find a spirit enriched area after purchasing spirit pills, then take them while practicing breathing exercises to absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, allowing the spirit pills to achieve their maximum effect.</p><p></p><p>It was very clear that was what those two had in mind.</p><p></p><p>Putting away the spirit pills, as for the other various spirit pills, Zhou You glanced at them and put them away too, they were all worthless items.</p><p></p><p>The thin cultivator had more miscellaneous items, mostly materials, and after careful inspection Zhou You discovered they were all materials for refining puppets.</p><p></p><p>Among them were mind control jade and spirit shocking wood thatZhou You could use, totaling...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Three pieces.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the thin cultivator's storage bag did not contain methods for refining puppets. It seems the thin cultivator wanted to take the path of refining puppets, so he bought a lot of materials, but he had not yet obtained the methods for refining puppets. </p><p></p><p>It's also possible that the thin cultivator had already memorized the methods for refining puppets.</p><p></p><p>It can be seen that apart from the jade slip serving as Meng Xun's order in the thin cultivator's storage bag, there were no other books, jade slips or other recorded items.</p><p></p><p>The reason that jade slip was kept was because after completing the mission, the thin cultivator needed to present the jade slip to receive the reward. Otherwise, the thin cultivator would probably have destroyed the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>However, what made Zhou You feel pleased was that the fat cultivator's storage bag contained two jade slips.</p><p></p><p>One jade slip recorded methods for refining talismans, including three talisman refining techniques: the Fire Talisman, the Calm Mind Talisman, and the Earth Explosion Talisman. </p><p></p><p>The first two were low-grade first level talismans, while the latter Earth Explosion Talisman was a mid-grade first level talisman!</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the fat cultivator had a mid-grade talisman pen, two boxes of cinnabar ink made from demonic beast blood, and nearly a hundred blank talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>It seems this fat cultivator was a talisman master.</p><p></p><p>"I've always wanted to become a talisman master, but never had the opportunity. Now I can finally fulfill my wish."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Previously, although Zhou You had some spirit stones, if he wanted to buy a simple talisman refining method, he could. But if he spent spirit stones on buying talisman methods, he wouldn't be able to afford the materials for the Minor Shocking Soul Formation.</p><p></p><p>But now that the fat cultivator was a talisman master, it was like a timely help.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You put away the items, and then looked at the other jade slip. Scanning it with his spiritual sense, he found it recorded a secret art called the Soul Controlling Technique.</p><p></p><p>This art was quite evil. After cultivating it, one could control those with weaker spiritual sense. The greater the gap in spiritual sense, the better the effect, provided the target was caught off guard.</p><p></p><p>The price was that the controlled person's spiritual sense would be damaged, causing mental disorders, or in severe cases, immediate death.</p><p></p><p>It seemed this was the method the fat and thin cultivators used to control Wang Ping.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You put it away, planning to cultivate it later. Not to mention other benefits, with the Golden Seal of "Great Way's Simplicity", cultivating it would at least grant him a bonus, probably related to spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>As his cultivation increased, Zhou You understood more and more the advantages of powerful spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>Apart from these, the fat cultivator had more than fifty talismans.</p><p></p><p>Among them were forty-five Fire Talismans, ten Calm Mind Talismans, and one Earth Explosion Talisman.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, more than forty Fire Talismans. Throwing them all at once could probably overwhelm even a late Qi Condensation cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You collected the talismans with an odd expression.</p><p></p><p>It was fortunate he didn't directly confront the fat and thin cultivators. Facing so many talismans, the outcome would likely have been unfavorable.</p><p></p><p>The Minor Shocking Soul Formation worked better, allowing him to capture two fifth level Qi Condensation cultivators effortlessly.</p><p></p><p>After organizing everything, Zhou You realized it was almost the fifth night watch. Since he wasn't going to rest, he took out a Absorbing Yuan Pill. After a moment's hesitation, he decided it was prudent to test if the pill had any issues first, given the night's events that made him more cautious.</p><p></p><p>He ground a bit of the pill into powder and fed it to a chicken.</p><p></p><p>Not long after:</p><p></p><p>"Cock-a-doodle-doo!"</p><p></p><p>The rooster started crowing.</p><p></p><p>It seemed there was no problem.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You put the chicken back in the coop and began cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Swallowing the Absorbing Yuan Pill, the spiritual qi of heaven and earth surged in. A golden meridian flickered in and out of visibility on Zhou You's abdomen.</p><p></p><p>Two hours passed as the purple qi heralded the dawn in the east.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You opened his eyes, a flash of delight showing in them!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

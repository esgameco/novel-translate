        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't set off for Erhai Lake until the sun had risen to three poles high. Without any means of transportation, he had to go on foot, and didn't arrive at Erhai Lake until the sun had set. </p><p></p><p>The last rays of the setting sun spilled over the calm surface of Erhai Lake. The distant snow-capped mountains glowed brilliantly under the evening sunlight, looking like several golden mountains full of treasures.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at this breathtakingly beautiful scenery, Zhou You was suddenly filled with soaring ambition. </p><p></p><p>"In such a vast world, how could I do justice to being a traveler from another world if I don't strive to go out and see it?"</p><p></p><p>The 800-li Erhai Lake stretched out vast and boundless, backed by towering mountains. It was an inherent asset of the Taibai Academy, teeming with spirit fish within.</p><p></p><p>It was said that these spirit fish were an important resource for cultivators on the path of immortality.</p><p></p><p>The Taibai Academy had laid down an array over Erhai Lake, deliberately requiring disciples to fish with rods and lines. The main purpose was to help disciples condense their spiritual power and temper their willpower.</p><p></p><p>Searching around nearby, Zhou You found the thatched hut where Zhao Bin lived.  </p><p></p><p>In fact, Erhai Lake was immense, with an extremely long shoreline. One might not encounter a single person for dozens of miles. The only reason Zhou You could find Zhao Bin's thatched hut was because he had obtained a route map beforehand.</p><p></p><p>Following the route map, he naturally found the place.</p><p></p><p>Inside the hut was quite messy, with wine jars strewn everywhere, clearly showing that Zhao Bin had not tidied up before his disappearance.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You set down his bundle, carried the wine jars out one by one, then swept the hut clean before taking out some dry rations to nibble on.</p><p></p><p>As he ate the dry rations, he stepped outside the hut. Moonlight poured down, the lake's surface rippling with shimmering waves. Occasionally a spirit fish would leap out, breaking the stillness.</p><p></p><p>Just outside the hut were a few cultivated vegetable plots, overgrown with weeds smothering the withered plants.  </p><p></p><p>It was evident that Zhao Bin rarely tended these plots.</p><p></p><p>It seemed there would be work to do in the future.</p><p></p><p>But Zhou You didn't mind. Living here was still more relaxing than being a servant at Xiao Yueying's place.</p><p></p><p>At least he faced the open sea, with spring's warmth and blossoming flowers.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After inspecting the surroundings, Zhou You finally returned inside and took out the bamboo slip Xiao Yueying had given him yesterday.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had temporarily broken away from the Xiao family, gaining a brief taste of freedom.</p><p></p><p>But Zhao Bin's inexplicable disappearance made Zhou You realize that the coveted cushy position envied by all the Xiao family servants also carried dangers.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know why Zhao Bin vanished," Zhou You pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>No one knew whether Zhao Bin had run away or been harmed.</p><p></p><p>Either was possible.</p><p></p><p>A faint sense of crisis welled up in Zhou You's heart.</p><p></p><p>He understood that no matter what, in this realm, enhancing his own strength would never be a mistake.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had the Golden Seal of Supreme Simplicity, he could test whether it could truly simplify cultivation methods!</p><p></p><p>The bamboo slip was not large, but its contents were extremely dense, with tiny script crammed into every inch.</p><p></p><p>By moonlight he could barely make it out, so Zhou You had to light a candle and bring it close to read.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Zhou You was utterly absorbed by the contents of the bamboo slip!</p><p></p><p>It recorded a cultivation method called the "Meridian Opening Manual" - according to the introduction, this was the simplest and most basic cultivation method in the immortal realm. Its effects were mediocre at best, only helping cultivators practice qi condensation and accumulate spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the cultivation speed was extremely slow!</p><p></p><p>Qi condensation was divided into nine levels, the first stage of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>And the "Meridian Opening Manual" in Zhou You's hands was merely the first volume, at most allowing a cultivator to reach the third level of qi condensation!</p><p></p><p>But thinking it over, this made sense.</p><p></p><p>To the Young Miss Xiao Yueying of the Xiao family, Zhou You's only use was fishing for spirit fish.  </p><p></p><p>Bestowing the "Meridian Opening Manual" was already an immense blessing, granting Zhou You the chance to cultivate immortality.</p><p></p><p>It was normal to only receive the first volume.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Zhou You did not lose heart, nor did he have lofty ambitions. </p><p></p><p>Cultivating immortality was extremely difficult, the most pressing task was to learn the "Opening the Meridians Scripture - Volume 1" first.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You continued reading the subsequent content on the bamboo slips. </p><p></p><p>Although the "Opening the Meridians Scripture" was the most basic cultivation method in the immortal world, its content was still abstruse and difficult to understand.Zhou You spent over an hour just to barely finish reading the entire first volume.</p><p></p><p>According to the "Opening the Meridians Scripture", the ancients believed that every living being was imperfect from birth, and everyone had flaws.</p><p></p><p>The process of cultivating immortality was to make up for one's own shortcomings and improve oneself.</p><p></p><p>When a person made up for all their flaws, they could attain the Dao!</p><p></p><p>Practicing inner energy cultivation was to develop one's meridian channels, condense spiritual power, and make up for one's deficiencies.</p><p></p><p>Every person had nine meridian channels, but they were undeveloped. What cultivators needed to do was open these meridian channels.</p><p></p><p>Opening one meridian channel was the first level of inner energy cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Opening two meridian channels was the second level of inner energy cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Continuing until all nine meridian channels were opened, that was considered complete perfection!</p><p></p><p>However, these meridian channels could only be opened by those with spiritual roots who could communicate with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, a lower-grade spiritual root was required.</p><p></p><p>The better the spiritual root, the higher the affinity with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, and naturally, the faster the speed of opening the meridians.</p><p></p><p>The "Opening the Meridians Scripture" mentioned four grades of spiritual roots: lower-grade, middle-grade, upper-grade, and premium-grade.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's spiritual root was a lower-grade one, the lowest level, just meeting the threshold for opening meridians.</p><p></p><p>"Nine meridian channels...I don't know how many I can open with the assistance of the 'Way of Ultimate Simplicity' golden seal?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You took a deep breath and began cultivating according to the method recorded in the "Opening the Meridians Scripture".</p><p></p><p>He sat cross-legged on the bed and slowly inhaled and exhaled.</p><p></p><p>Although the "Opening the Meridians Scripture" was the most ordinary, it had one advantage that other cultivation methods did not - it could guide beginners step-by-step in their practice.</p><p></p><p>Other cultivation methods didn't even have breathing methods!</p><p></p><p>Thus,Zhou You's breathing became deeper and shallower, beginning to show subtle changes.</p><p></p><p>At first, Zhou You felt this breathing method was difficult to grasp, and his chest felt stifled.</p><p></p><p>After two full hours, he found his body starting to become numb, as if countless invisible tadpoles were swimming into his body.</p><p></p><p>"This should be the so-called spiritual energy, right?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You thought to himself: "The 'Opening the Meridians Scripture' says that those with lower-grade spiritual roots need at least half a day to sense spiritual energy, but I only took two hours. Could it be because of the 'Way of Ultimate Simplicity' golden seal?"</p><p></p><p>As the spiritual energy surged intoZhou You's body, his body was tempered, and a faint golden meridian channel appeared on his left arm.</p><p></p><p>However, this golden meridian channel was illusory, slowly solidifying at a gradual pace.</p><p></p><p>Once it completely solidified, it would mean Zhou You had fully solidified this meridian channel, reaching the first level of inner energy cultivation!</p><p></p><p>Another two hours passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The golden seal with the words "Way of Ultimate Simplicity" engraved in Zhou You's spiritual ocean emitted a golden light.</p><p></p><p>Then, a line of text appeared on the golden seal.</p><p></p><p>"Opening the Meridians Scripture - Volume 1 (1/100): A basic immortal cultivation method, daily breathing exercises can increase progress by 1, complete in 100 days!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that line of text, Zhou You's eyes flickered slightly as he exhaled.</p><p></p><p>The "Way of Ultimate Simplicity" golden seal could indeed be used for immortal cultivation methods!</p><p></p><p>And it was so simple!</p><p></p><p>He only needed to cultivate for two hours each day to increase the progress by one.</p><p></p><p>It was just unknown whether reaching 100 progress would allow him to raise his cultivation to the third level of inner energy cultivation.</p><p></p><p>I have signed a contract. If you think it's good, please add it to your bookshelf. Thank you!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

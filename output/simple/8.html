        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Spiritual Sand is a type of item formed from crushed low-grade Spirit Stones. </p><p></p><p>Each grain of Spiritual Sand contains a small amount of spiritual energy that can aid cultivators in their practice.</p><p></p><p>Most of the time it can also be used as a currency for trade. </p><p></p><p>Generally, one hundred grains of Spiritual Sand can be exchanged for one low-grade Spirit Stone.</p><p></p><p>According to Huang Li, this kind of thing called Spiritual Sand can only be obtained by deducting it from the spiritual fish caught by fish servants, and then selling them in the Inner Market to exchange for some Spiritual Sand for daily cultivation practice. </p><p></p><p>The master's family would never waste Spiritual Sand on fish servants like them.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You also believed what Huang Li said. </p><p></p><p>After all, if a fish servant cultivated to the Foundation Establishment realm, they could leave the family.</p><p></p><p>Which member of the family would help a fish servant cultivate?</p><p></p><p>So it was very unusual for Xiao Yueying to not only give them silver but also Spiritual Sand.</p><p></p><p>This was extremely suspicious!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You recalled the previous Zhao Bin, who would regularly hand over a fixed amount of spiritual fish each month, but he had never heard Xiao Yueying say she was satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Generally, Xiao Yueying would just casually dismiss him.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the young lady Xiao Yueying had taken a liking to him?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You racked his brains but could not figure it out, so he could only temporarily put this matter aside for now.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Zhou You still pocketed the Spiritual Sand and took all the silver to the Inner Market.</p><p></p><p>His main purpose for coming to the Inner Market this time was to purchase a martial arts manual.</p><p></p><p>"Since even basic living skills like sweeping and farming can provide spiritual power and energy enhancements, if I practice martial arts, the enhancements may be even greater," Zhou You thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Practicing martial arts was not just for gaining various ability enhancements, but also to increase his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Bin's disappearance and Xiao Yueying's abnormal rewards gave Zhou You a great sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>He had to find a way to strengthen himself.</p><p></p><p>After considering it over and over, martial arts seemed to be the only way to rapidly increase his strength in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Ever since learning that he could leave his servitude after reaching the Foundation Establishment realm, Zhou You's motivation was clearly stronger.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation world, basically no one practiced martial arts, so they were not valuable.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You spent fifteen taels of silver in the Inner Market to buy a sword manual called 'Illumination Sword Technique'.</p><p></p><p>The sword technique was quite extreme, and did not require internal energy to perform.</p><p></p><p>The only downside was that it demanded extremely high reaction and attentiveness.</p><p></p><p>To perform it, one had to find extremely opportune moments, utilizing the refraction and reflection of light to achieve the best effect and accomplish an instant kill with a single sword strike!</p><p></p><p>Actually, Zhou You did not want to buy this sword manual, but he had no choice - this was already the cheapest martial arts secret manual.</p><p></p><p>While martial arts were not valuable to cultivators, even the most ordinary martial arts secret manual was still worth dozens of taels of silver.</p><p></p><p>This 'Illumination Sword Technique' was already the cheapest martial arts Zhou You could find.</p><p></p><p>The seller even felt he was shortchanging Zhou You, so he gave him a rusty iron sword as an extra gift.</p><p></p><p>Mainly because in the mortal world, no one practiced this sword technique, so no one could master it.</p><p></p><p>It just so happened that Zhou You met the cultivation requirements for this sword technique, so Zhou You bought it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After returning to Erhai Lake, Zhou You first caught that day's spiritual fish, tended to the vegetables in the garden, and only then did he return to his room to study the sword manual.</p><p></p><p>By now night had fallen, so Zhou You lit a coal oil lamp.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown if it was because he had previously cultivated immortality, but Zhou You quickly picked up the 'Illumination Sword Technique'.</p><p></p><p>He followed the movements described in the manual, borrowing the dim yellow light of the coal oil lamp. After only practicing for half a shichen (two hours), the golden imprint in his consciousness began to shine brightly.</p><p></p><p>Then, a line of text appeared.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>【Light and Shadow Sword Technique (1/100): A very simple sword technique, practice it five times a day, and you can master it in a month!】</p><p></p><p>Zhou You saw those words and nodded with satisfaction. </p><p></p><p>One month's time was not too long.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't know what kind of bonus he would get after mastering it.</p><p></p><p>After starting to learn the Light and Shadow Sword Technique, Zhou You did not stop there, but continued practicing with the Broken Wind Sword in the house for a long time, until his progress reached 5, before stopping.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was drenched in sweat, so he went to take a bath in Erhai Lake, and only then did he return to the house to eat something and rest.</p><p></p><p>Just like that, more than ten days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Zhou You's life was quite comfortable. </p><p></p><p>Every day, he would cultivate, then water the vegetable garden, fish for spirit fish, and practice the Light and Shadow Sword Technique in the evening.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You discovered a peculiar thing.</p><p></p><p>The vegetables he planted seemed to mature faster than normal.</p><p></p><p>For example, with regular cabbages, the normal maturation period from sowing to maturity is two months.</p><p></p><p>However, the cabbages planted by Zhou You were almost mature after only a month and a half, and he didn't know if it was due to the soil or because he watered them with water from Erhai Lake.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You decided to plant more things in the future to test it out and see what the reason was.</p><p></p><p>And on this day, Zhou You finally understood why Xiao Yueyingave him spirit sand!</p><p></p><p>That night, Huang Li brought a few jars of wine and some food to Zhou You's place.</p><p></p><p>When Zhou You saw those wine jars, he couldn't help but think of the room full of wine jars when he first arrived here.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Zhao Bin had not been stingy about drinking with this Huang Li before.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhou, would you like to drink with me?"</p><p></p><p>Huang Li had a bitter expression on his face, looking very unhappy.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You nodded and did not refuse.</p><p></p><p>The two sat down, and Huang Li drank heavily, while Zhou You did not speak, mainly because their relationship was not particularly good, and since the other party did not speak, he did not ask either.</p><p></p><p>After drinking two large bowls of wine, the alcohol seemed to have provoked Huang Li's dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at Zhou You and said, "Brother Zhou, do you think it's easy for us fish servants? Every day, we cultivate just a little spiritual power, all of which is used for fishing spirit fish, wasting a lot of time. This is blatant exploitation!"</p><p></p><p>"But what grievances can we have? We just obediently fish spirit fish for the master's family. For years, we have been diligent and never slacked off! But the master's family, just because I didn't hand over a few spirit fish, scolded me harshly!"</p><p></p><p>"It's really disheartening!"</p><p></p><p>Listening to the dissatisfaction in Huang Li's words, Zhou You remained silent and did not express any opinion.</p><p></p><p>Then, Huang Li drank and complained about the young master of the Huo family, as if the young master of the Huo family had done something outrageous, listing ten crimes of the young master of the Huo family.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You just listened silently.</p><p></p><p>For him, what was the use of saying all this?</p><p></p><p>Instead of complaining, it was better to cultivate diligently and strive to succeed in building a foundation.</p><p></p><p>After getting rid of the status of a servant, everything would naturally become normal.</p><p></p><p>After a round of complaints, Huang Li looked at Zhou You and said, "Brother Zhou, haven't you had any grievances after being a servant in the Xiao family for so many years?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You shook his head and said, "It was alright. Over the years, I was responsible for cleaning the outer courtyard, so I rarely saw the young lady, and naturally, she would not scold me."</p><p></p><p>Huang Li showed a strange expression and said, "You'll know later."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You frowned and said, "What do you mean by that?"</p><p></p><p>Huang Li hesitated for a moment, as if he had made a certain decision, and finally said in a low voice, "Brother Zhou, do you know why Zhao Bin disappeared?"</p><p></p><p>Please keep following, and please recommend this novel.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

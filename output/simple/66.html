        <h1>Chapter 66</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't expect Jiang Yuyao to be so direct. </p><p></p><p>So he asked, "What does Junior Sister Jiang need from me?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuyao looked up, seeing Taibai Academy disciples walking down the ancient path. So she waited for those Taibai disciples to pass by before speaking, "Can we talk in private?"</p><p></p><p>Saying that, Jiang Yuyao glanced at a small path beside the ancient road.</p><p></p><p>That small path led to other places in Cangshan Mountain. Generally, not many people took that route.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You nodded and followed Jiang Yuyao into the shaded ancient path.</p><p></p><p>After walking for about half an hour, there was a pavilion up ahead. Jiang Yuyao stopped at the pavilion and waited for Zhou You to enter before casting a restrictive spell to prevent eavesdropping from nearby.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhou You couldn't help but feel puzzled.</p><p></p><p>What matter was so secretive?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You asked, "Junior Sister Jiang, what important matter do you have?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuyao looked at Zhou You with her big orchid-like eyes and said, "Senior Brother Zhou, don't you think Wang Tiezhu has been acting strange lately?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhou You's heart stirred, but he didn't answer directly. Instead, he asked, "What do you mean by that?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuyao stared at Zhou You intently, as if trying to see something in his eyes. For a moment, she didn't speak.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhou You thought, "Is there something on my face?"</p><p></p><p>So he cleared his throat and said, "Junior Sister Jiang, feel free to speak your mind."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuyao said, "Wang Tiezhu has been acting strange lately. You should be careful going forward."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You narrowed his eyes slightly, then nodded, "Thank you, Junior Sister Jiang, for the reminder."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuyao nodded without saying anything more, then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>It seemed her only purpose in coming here was to kindly warn him.</p><p></p><p>Watching Jiang Yuyao's departing figure, Zhou You stood there for a while until he could no longer see her. Only then did he return to the main path and head down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Even if Jiang Yuyao hadn't come to find Zhou You, he would still be wary of Wang Tiezhu.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Zhou You didn't really have much connection with Wang Tiezhu. At most, they would have some exchanges when attending lectures each month.</p><p></p><p>As for ordinary times, they wouldn't even see each other, let alone interact.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You quickly left Taibai Academy's mountain gate and returned to the inn, beginning to carefully ponder the content of Master He Taichang's lecture that day.</p><p></p><p>This time, the main topic was about body refinement.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation experiences Master He spoke of did provide some help for Zhou You, but not much. What helped more were the body refinement experiences.</p><p></p><p>Just like the first time he heard Master Liu's lecture, it was an enlightening feeling that made Zhou You feel extremely refreshed, with many areas becoming clear.</p><p></p><p>After researching it thoroughly, Zhou You exhaled slowly and began cultivating the 'Bone Tempering Technique'.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You cultivated the 'Bone Tempering Technique' combined with the experiences Master He mentioned, and clearly felt much smoother sailing during the cultivation, incomparably seamless.</p><p></p><p>"At least a 30% increase in cultivation speed!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's eyes flashed, satisfied with this result. Then he said, "If I could learn directly from Master He Taichang, the improvement would likely be even greater. What a pity."</p><p></p><p>After cultivating for two hours, Zhou You realized it was already the early morning of the next day. After a short break, he began cultivating the 'Longevity Technique'.</p><p></p><p>Another two hours later, Zhou You finished cultivating. Following his usual routine, he checked out of the inn, returned to his hut to leave the jade pendant, then went to the market town to exchange his talisman papers for spirit stones and purchase elemental pills for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had now reached the seventh layer of Qi Condensation, the late stage of the Qi Condensation realm, so he could consume elemental pills.</p><p></p><p>The enhancement from elemental pills was indeed more significant than that of the lesser spirit-gathering pills.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>If taking the Nayuan Pill without considering drug resistance, taking one pill per day increases the progress of the 'Changchun Skill' by 1 point and can shorten the time by five days. As for the Diyuan Pill, it can shorten the time by six days. </p><p></p><p>Thus, originally after Zhou You listened to the lecture, the 'Changchun Skill' would increase by 1 progress point every 14 days. But if taking one Diyuan Pill per day, it would only take 8 days to increase by 1 progress point.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the initial 20 days needed to increase by 1 point, this is more than double the cultivation speed!</p><p></p><p>Of course, as long as it's a pill, there will be drug resistance. </p><p></p><p>The increase is greatest at the beginning, and it gets smaller until it disappears.</p><p></p><p>However, it will be much better when reaching the Foundation Establishment stage. There are few pills that can be used in the Qi Condensation stage, but there are many more pills that can be used in the Foundation Establishment stage. Just based on what Zhou You currently knows, there are three kinds of pills that can increase his cultivation base in the early Foundation Establishment stage!</p><p></p><p>If one pill develops resistance, he can simply switch to another kind.</p><p></p><p>It's just that more time is needed to refine and remove the pill toxicity.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Zhou You also noticed some Foundation Establishment cultivation techniques in the market.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You is currently at the 7th level of Qi Condensation. As long as he advances to the 9th level, he can start cultivating Foundation Establishment techniques.</p><p></p><p>With Zhou You's current talisman crafting skills, where even first-grade top-quality talismans can make a profit, purchasing a Foundation Establishment technique would not be difficult.</p><p></p><p>However, it's not that simple to pick a suitable Foundation Establishment technique.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating at the Foundation Establishment stage must be even more difficult, requiring a good technique to aid in the process.</p><p></p><p>There is a huge difference between an ordinary technique and a top-notch one.</p><p></p><p>Just like the 'Kai Mai Jue' - cultivating the latter part requires one month to increase progress by 1 point, while the 'Changchun Gong' only needs 20 days, increasing the speed by one-third.</p><p></p><p>So naturally, it's better to get a better technique if possible.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You has not reached the 9th level of Qi Condensation yet, so he has time.</p><p></p><p>If he still can't find one by then, he can buy a wood-based technique as a stopgap.</p><p></p><p>After browsing around, Zhou You returned to his hut and continued refining talismans. After that, he started pill refinement.</p><p></p><p>For the current Zhou You, pill refinement could also serve as a way to earn spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the cost is very low since he has his own cultivated spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>When he originally purchased the spirit herb seeds, he bought them according to the types needed for the Pei Yuan Pill, Na Yuan Pill, and Di Yuan Pill.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Zhou You can only refine the first-grade middle-quality Na Yuan Pill for now, and the success rate is not high either.</p><p></p><p>After all, he has only been learning for a little over half a year. Before reaching the 7th level of Qi Condensation, he could only refine Bi Gu Pills due to insufficient spiritual power. From when he started until now, it has only been about a month in total.</p><p></p><p>Being able to refine a first-grade middle-quality Na Yuan Pill within a month, Zhou You even suspects that he may have some special pill refinement talent.</p><p></p><p>After refining pills, Zhou You's spiritual power was almost depleted. As usual, he went to tend to the spirit herbs in the medicine field.</p><p></p><p>After tending to them, he found that his [Planting] skill had finally reached 100 points, becoming completely mastered!</p><p></p><p>[Planting] is one of the skills Zhou You values the most, with its unique time acceleration function being incredibly useful when applied to spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>As long as it's a spirit herb, gaining age definitely increases its value.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, for spirit herbs, time is money.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after mastering [Planting], he can also gain a special trait.</p>

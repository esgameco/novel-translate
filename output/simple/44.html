        <h1>Chapter 44</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The small town was built against the mountain, with some even constructed on the mountain itself, hidden above the clouds. Occasionally cultivators would fly in on their swords, giving it the appearance of a celestial realm. </p><p></p><p>At the entrance stood an ancient archway inscribed with the four ancient characters "Cuiwei Market Town."</p><p></p><p>This was indeed Cuiwei Market Town. </p><p></p><p>Zhou You walked into the market town, where many cultivators at the third and fourth levels of qi cultivation had set up stalls along the streets. </p><p></p><p>Most cultivators only sold one type of item. Some sold talisman papers, some sold spirit pills, some sold magic weapons, and others sold certain materials.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators were bargaining at the stalls. </p><p></p><p>The items sold on the streets were mostly low-grade, with few mid-grade items to be seen. </p><p></p><p>As Zhou You walked along, he saw many strange and curious things, all quite novel.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You did not intend to buy anything from these stalls. He had come here mainly to sell his loot, not to purchase these materials.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the items he was selling were not something ordinary people could afford. A top-grade magic weapon, worth over a thousand spirit stones - how could an ordinary cultivator afford that?</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, it was best to auction off magic weapons of this level at an auction house, where the prices offered were higher and relatively safer.</p><p></p><p>Institutions capable of holding auctions were highly reputable, usually presided over by the Tao White Academy.</p><p></p><p>After strolling around, Zhou You found an inn to stay at first.</p><p></p><p>This market town was managed by the Tao White Academy, so it was relatively safe - at least no one would dare to make a move within the market town.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You rented a room on the lower floor of the inn.</p><p></p><p>When traveling, it was wise not to flaunt one's wealth.</p><p></p><p>Staying in a lower room was the better choice.</p><p></p><p>After residing at the inn for two days, Zhou You had a good understanding of the situation in the market town, mainly inquiring about which shops had better reputations, to facilitate his sales.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he decided on Tao White Hall.</p><p></p><p>Tao White Hall was the Tao White Academy's own shop.</p><p></p><p>It was also the most comprehensive store in the entire market town, dealing in all kinds of business - spirit pills, talisman papers, formations, magic weapons, and more.</p><p></p><p>And being the Tao White Academy's market, its reputation was unquestionable.</p><p></p><p>Whether buying or selling, the prices were generally market rates.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the "market rates" here referred to the purchase prices.</p><p></p><p>For example, the market purchase price for a top-grade magic weapon was one thousand spirit stones, but when sold, there would often be a premium of around ten percent.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You could also choose to sell the items himself by setting up a stall.</p><p></p><p>However, this carried relative risks. Other materials like spirit pills and talisman papers were fine, but a top-grade magic weapon would be more troublesome. Ordinary cultivators couldn't afford it, and the appearance of such a weapon would undoubtedly attract unwanted attention - not what Zhou You wanted to see.</p><p></p><p>Apart from setting up a stall, there were two other channels.</p><p></p><p>One was the aforementioned auction.</p><p></p><p>The other was underground trading sessions.</p><p></p><p>The first option was very safe, but Zhou You had inquired and learned that there would be no auctions in Cuiwei Market Town for at least the next six months.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You couldn't wait that long, of course.</p><p></p><p>The second option was even less safe than setting up a stall.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Zhou You eventually decided to sell the items to Tao White Hall.</p><p></p><p>After disguising himself, Zhou You approached Tao White Hall, but was stopped by a young cultivator at the second level of qi cultivation who looked like an attendant.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, would you like to buy some spirit pills?" The attendant smiled and asked with a pointed mouth.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You raised his brows and said, "No, thanks."</p><p></p><p>The attendant continued, "Then what about talisman papers? Formations? Magic weapons? I have them all for sale here, guaranteed to be from legitimate sources! The same as Tao White Hall's, but my prices are ten percent cheaper. What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You shook his head and continued walking inside.</p><p></p><p>The attendant went on, "Or does the friend wish to sell something? I also purchase all kinds of materials and magic weapons here, no questions asked about the source. My prices match Tao White Hall's, but I can take everything at once. How about it?"</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Zhou You remained expressionless and ignored the servant boy. </p><p></p><p>He also did not expect that there would actually exist professions similar to brokers within this market street.</p><p></p><p>SeeingZhou You's reaction, the servant boy did not persist and immediately found another person to approach.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You came to Taibai Street only to sell some talisman papers. </p><p></p><p>Zhou You could now effortlessly produce first-grade low-level fire talisman and mind-calming talisman with a success rate of around eighty percent.</p><p></p><p>He could completely earn money this way.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had over a hundred fire talismans on him. He sold fifty and kept fifty. As for the mind-calming talismans, he had sixty, selling fifty and keeping ten which was enough.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, the fire talismans are eight spirit stones each. Fifty fire talismans is four hundred spirit stones in total. The mind-calming talismans are five spirit stones each. Fifty of them is two hundred and fifty spirit stones. The total is six hundred and fifty spirit stones. You can check."</p><p></p><p>The clerk at Taibai Street handedZhou You a bag, smiling as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You sensed with his spiritual awareness that inside were six middle-grade spirit stones and fifty low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have the method to refine first-grade middle-level talismans here?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You asked.</p><p></p><p>The clerk smiled with cupped fists, "Congratulations to friend for advancing to a first-grade middle-level talisman master."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You smiled wryly, "It's not like I've advanced to a first-grade middle-level talisman master, I'm just trying it out."</p><p></p><p>In fact, Zhou You could already attempt to draw the first-grade middle-level earth explosion talisman with a success rate of around twenty percent. </p><p></p><p>There were more than ten earth explosion talismans lying in his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>The clerk did not respond, but instead placed a jade slip in front of Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, the jade slip records all the first-grade middle-level talismans and some high-level talismans available at our shop. Take a look at which one you need," the clerk smiled.</p><p></p><p>Alchemists, talisman masters, and artifact refiners often came to their shop for such transactions. </p><p></p><p>They did not want to waste time setting up stalls to sell their products themselves, so they came to the shop to sell their finished products. After selling, they would directly purchase some inheritances.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the clerk found it unsurprising.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You also knew this, which is why he directly asked to purchase the talisman refining methods.</p><p></p><p>Probing the jade slip with his spiritual awareness, Zhou You saw that it recorded eight kinds of first-grade middle-level talismans and two kinds of first-grade high-level talismans.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take the green wood talisman."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You said.</p><p></p><p>The green wood talisman was a relatively common first-grade middle-level talisman. When used, it could manifest a huge green wood to attack, equivalent to the spell attack of the fifth level of Qi cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Good, four hundred spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>The clerk turned and took out a jade slip from a cabinet behind the counter.</p><p></p><p>Inwardly,Zhou You could not help but be amazed - these inheritances were indeed expensive.</p><p></p><p>Among the four immortal arts of cultivation - artifact refining, talisman making, pill concocting, and formation setting - the inheritances of each were extremely expensive and rare. Purchasing them required a considerable cost.</p><p></p><p>Because once you learned these skills, you could also earn money from them.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Zhou You did not dally and took out four middle-grade spirit stones from his spirit stone pouch to give to the clerk. He also spent thirty low-grade spirit stones to buy a certain amount of monster blood, cinnabar, and talisman paper before leaving.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You did not leave the market street right away. Instead, he returned to the inn to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>He planned to sell the items he had in batches, being cautious as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon,Zhou You left the inn through another exit and changed his appearance again before re-entering Taibai Street.</p><p></p><p>This time, he sold all the useless pills he had, including advancement pills like the "Moongazing Pill", earning a total of three hundred and fifty-five spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Adding the spirit stones from selling talismans in the morning, he obtained a total of five hundred and seventy-five spirit stones, plus the method to make the green wood talisman.</p><p></p><p>However, as he was about to leave, the clerk asked, "Friend, are you an alchemist?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You paused and looked at the clerk, "What about it?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You also understood that the more this was the case, the more cautious he had to be. </p><p></p><p>"Although the 'The Way of Simplicity' golden seal only provides two hours of cultivation enhancement per day, the spiritual power gained is extraordinary. This indirectly shows how remarkable this object is. It seems that in the future in the cultivation world, I must be very careful and cautious, and never reveal my trump cards!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You thought secretly, deciding to act carefully. </p><p></p><p>No matter what he did, he could not recklessly stand out.</p><p></p><p>However, what Zhou You did not know was that with the assistance of the 'The Way of Simplicity' golden seal, even if he only cultivated for two hours, his cultivation progress far exceeded ordinary people!</p><p></p><p>How could an ordinary lower-grade spiritual root possibly condense the first meridian channel and enter the first level of Qi cultivation within just twenty days?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, another five days passed.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You fished up the fifth spiritual fish according to his routine, placed it in the fish protector, and then put away his rod.</p><p></p><p>[Fishing Spiritual Fish Â· First Lower Grade (100/100): A rather skillful study, but not a great one. Five catches a day, twenty days to succeed!]</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the radiance of the golden seal in his consciousness sea shone brilliantly, and a line of text appeared.</p><p></p><p>Then, Zhou You felt a mysterious force surge from the golden seal into his mind.</p><p></p><p>"What enhancement does fishing spiritual fish give?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You sensed the changes in his body.</p><p></p><p>There was no enhancement to his strength, no enhancement to his speed, and it didn't seem like his spiritual power was enhanced either.</p><p></p><p>So what was enhanced?</p><p></p><p>As Zhou You pondered, he heard the sound of a mosquito buzzing, and then he saw the mosquito flying towards him, obviously intending to suck his blood.</p><p></p><p>Everything here was fine, except for the abundance of mosquitoes.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had no way to deal with this.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that mosquito, Zhou You didn't pay much attention to it at first. He casually tried to swat it away, but suddenly found that the mosquito's speed was unusually slow.</p><p></p><p>This time, Zhou You directly caught the mosquito.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was stunned for a moment, then quickly realized it must be his illusion. He opened his palm to let the mosquito go, and then carefully watched its movements.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough!</p><p></p><p>The mosquito's movements had become much slower!</p><p></p><p>What was going on with this mosquito?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You quickly looked around and spotted another mosquito.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the other mosquito's movements were also very slow!</p><p></p><p>In comparison, his own reaction speed seemed to have increased!</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the enhancement I gained after successfully fishing the spiritual fish was speed? No, that's not right!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You quickly realized, "It's not speed, it should be reaction time! My reaction time has increased, so the mosquitoes' movements appear relatively slower!"</p><p></p><p>After figuring it out, Zhou You couldn't help but smile.</p><p></p><p>Enhancing reaction time is sometimes better than enhancing strength.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was very satisfied with this enhancement.</p><p></p><p>This made Zhou You look forward to the 'The Way of Simplicity' golden seal even more. He didn't know what enhancements he would get after learning other skills.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You pondered, since he had nothing to do every day, he might as well take some time to chop firewood or something. Who knows, he might get enhancements from that too?</p><p></p><p>"This Daoist friend, you really do have a leisurely attitude."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a hearty laugh came from afar, "To be playing with mosquitoes while fishing spiritual fish, haha."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You turned his head to see a young man dressed in a coarse linen robe with a tanned face approaching from a distance.</p><p></p><p>With his keen perception, Zhou You detected a trace of spiritual aura from the young man, who was probably also a cultivator. However, since Zhou You had not yet reached the third level of Qi Cultivation and had not birthed his spiritual sense, he could not probe the young man's cultivation level when the other party did not actively use spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Judging from his attire, it seemed his status was likely the same as Zhou You's - a servant fishing spiritual fish for a certain noble family.</p><p></p><p>It was only to save face that he addressed Zhou You as "Daoist friend".</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Zhou You stood up and said politely, "Excuse me."</p><p></p><p>"Are you the new fish servant sent by the Xiao family?" The swarthy young man smiled and asked.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't understand. "Fish servant?"</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, it's normal that you don't know since you're new. A fish servant is a servant sent by the aristocratic families specifically to fish for spiritual fish."</p><p></p><p>"I see, thank you!"  Zhou You cupped his hands in a gesture of respect.</p><p></p><p>The swarthy young man sat down casually next to Zhou You. "My surname is Huang, with the given name of 'Li'. I'm the fish servant of the Young Master of the Huo family from Nanzhu. What's your name, friend?"</p><p></p><p>The Huo family was also a cultivating family from Nanzhu, but not as prestigious as the Xiao family. It was said that the Young Master of the Huo family had already entered Taibai Academy in Lincheng to cultivate a few years ago.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You said, "I'm Zhou You."</p><p></p><p>Huang Li exchanged some more pleasantries, then enthusiastically taught Zhou You some skills for fishing spiritual fish. </p><p></p><p>By now, Zhou You had already fully mastered the skills for fishing low-grade first-level spiritual fish. He could hit the mark every time without wasting a single cast.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't show it and maintained a humble appearance instead. After all, in others' eyes, he was just a newcomer. If he showed he knew everything, it would seem too abnormal.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, during the conversation, Zhou You also obtained quite a bit of information about the cultivation world from Huang Li.</p><p></p><p>For example, the low-grade first-level spiritual fish they often caught was called the Qiusha Fish, a fish containing a small amount of earth spiritual qi. Cultivators with an earth spiritual root could cook it to slightly enhance their spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Another example, if the fish servants were skilled at fishing and had surplus spiritual fish left after completing their master family's tasks, they could sell the extra spiritual fish at the Inner Market to exchange for a small amount of spiritual sand.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual sand was ground from low-grade spiritual stones and contained a bit of spiritual qi to aid in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But most importantly, he learned about the way to be freed from servitude!</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, isn't that what we fish servants are aiming for - to be freed from servitude?" Huang Li smiled and said, "Brother Zhou, you probably don't know how to be freed from servitude yet, right?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You nodded. He indeed didn't know, but his heart also yearned for it.</p><p></p><p>Huang Li said, "For ordinary servants, it's absolutely impossible to be freed from servitude in a cultivating aristocratic family. But for us fish servants who come into contact with cultivation, there's a glimmer of hope."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You humbly said, "Please enlighten me, Brother Huang."</p><p></p><p>Huang Li said, "There are two ways to be freed from servitude. The first is to cultivate to the Foundation Establishment realm. The Great Zhou Dynasty had a rule that Celestial Cultivators of the Foundation Establishment realm are not bound by the servitude of aristocratic families. On the day you establish your foundation, you'll regain your freedom. By then, not to mention servitude, even those cultivating aristocratic families will have to treat you with respect."</p><p></p><p>"The second way is to become a disciple of an elder from a cultivation institution or sect. In that case, your servitude will automatically be lifted."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Huang Li smiled, "Of course, if you're lucky enough, there's also a third possibility."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was surprised. "A third?"</p><p></p><p>Huang Li nodded. "Yes, that is if the cultivating family you serve suddenly has a change of heart and voluntarily lifts your servitude."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You gave a wry smile. This third possibility was the most impossible possibility.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You also knew that Huang Li was just joking.</p><p></p><p>It was more realistic to strive in cultivation and reach Foundation Establishment, rather than hoping the cultivating family would have a change of heart and lift the servitude.</p><p></p><p>Only by doing it this way would it be the proper path.</p><p></p><p>[Request for bookmarks, monthly tickets, and followers!]</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 13</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He still needs to save money!</p><p></p><p>It would be great if there was a channel to sell spirit fish. </p><p></p><p>For Zhou You, the thing he has the most right now is spirit fish, which can also be exchanged for spirit sand.</p><p></p><p>However, he cannot casually sell his spirit fish, otherwise it may draw the attention of others. </p><p></p><p>Zhou You calculated that starting next month, he should be able to sell ten spirit fish per month, which is twenty grains of spirit sand.</p><p></p><p>Assuming Xiao Yueying gives him ten more grains of spirit sand per month, that would be thirty grains of spirit sand per month.</p><p></p><p>The cheapest method to conceal his cultivation requires five spirit stones, which is five hundred grains of spirit sand.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, in over a year's time, Zhou You would be able to purchase the means to conceal his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Before that, he must be extremely cautious in everything.</p><p></p><p>If he doesn't need to use spiritual power, he will try his best not to use it.</p><p></p><p>That way, as long as no cultivator deliberately observes his cultivation, his cultivation level will not be exposed.</p><p></p><p>He can ensure his safety to the greatest extent.</p><p></p><p>If he is truly exposed and unable to continue hiding, then Zhou You will have to leave this place and become a wandering cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Although he wants to go through the proper channels to remove his servant status, if he truly encounters danger, Zhou You will not be stubborn to that extent - he will leave if he must.</p><p></p><p>After all, once he reaches the Foundation Establishment realm, the soul imprint will automatically be removed.</p><p></p><p>After washing off the dirt on his body, Zhou You began to rest.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Zhou You's life returned to calm.</p><p></p><p>Every morning he would cultivate, and after finishing, he would start tending to his vegetable garden, then observe the newly cultivated vegetable patch to see if the vegetables grew differently when watered with different water sources.</p><p></p><p>As the seedlings grew vigorously during this period, Zhou You did not notice any difference in the growth of the vegetables on the two sides - they were almost in sync.</p><p></p><p>Apart from observing the vegetable garden, he would also go fishing for spirit fish as usual.</p><p></p><p>Up until now, he could only catch first-grade low-rank spirit fish.</p><p></p><p>After completing these tasks, Zhou You had nothing else to do and had plenty of time.</p><p></p><p>So he continued to practice his Light and Shadow Sword technique.</p><p></p><p>This was almost his only means of fighting enemies at the moment. Although he had reached the perfect stage, Zhou You firmly believed that as long as he kept practicing, he would become more and more proficient.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to develop a conditioned reflex where as soon as he picked up a sword, he could use the Light and Shadow Sword technique and capture light and shadows to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>This way, when fighting enemies, he would naturally have a better chance of winning.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Zhou You did not see Huang Li again.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Huang Li had truly run away to join the Wandering Cultivators' Righteous Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You could only wish him luck in his heart.</p><p></p><p>On the tenth day after Huang Li left, Zhou You, holding a rusty iron sword, felt that he should probably sharpen this iron sword.</p><p></p><p>However, after searching his thatched hut, he could not find a whetstone, so he had no choice but to go to the inner sect to purchase one.</p><p></p><p>After buying it, Zhou You started sharpening the sword while fishing by the lake.</p><p></p><p>Sharpening a sword is a meticulous activity that requires patience.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Zhou You got a new neighbor.</p><p></p><p>She was a slender and graceful young lady wearing a white Daoist robe.</p><p></p><p>The young lady carried a long sword and stood by the lakeside two li away from Zhou You. Her cultivation level was indiscernible, but she looked towards Zhou You's direction, seemingly puzzled as to why he was sharpening an ordinary iron sword.</p><p></p><p>Little did she know, this was Zhou You's only weapon now.</p><p></p><p>The young lady only glanced at him briefly before withdrawing her gaze. She focused her mind and body on fishing, sitting down quietly to fish nearby.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Zhou You also noticed the young lady. From her attire, she was clearly a disciple of the Tao White Academy.</p><p></p><p>As for her depth of cultivation, Zhou You could not tell.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the young lady, Zhou You frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>After all, he did not want to interact with others, especially disciples of the Tao White Academy. These people, not to mention their status, definitely had higher cultivation levels than him, making it easy for them to see through his true cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This way, he naturally found himself in an invisible danger as well. </p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You could not just leave this place, as that would only draw more attention to himself.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You pretended as if nothing had happened and continued sharpening his sword. </p><p></p><p>Fortunately, two hours later, the young lady left on her sword, without paying much attention to Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>Watching the young lady fly away on her sword, Zhou You could not help but let his mind wander.</p><p></p><p>Flying on a sword, the lifelong dream of so many people.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You also firmly believed that one day, sooner or later, he would fly on a sword himself, to take a look at this vast world.</p><p></p><p>"But it seems this young lady is not very smart?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked at the place where the young lady had been.</p><p></p><p>For two hours, she had failed to catch even a single spiritual fish.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, Zhou You had caught three spiritual fish in just half an hour. </p><p></p><p>And that was with him deliberately suppressing himself because there were other people around.</p><p></p><p>"What's the point of mocking others? Who knows how strong her talents in cultivation are? I just have some small skills."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You cautioned himself silently, then continued sharpening his sword.</p><p></p><p>Another half hour passed before Zhou You finally removed all the rust from the iron sword.</p><p></p><p>However, it still could not be considered sharp.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's expression changed slightly, his consciousness turning inward as he saw the golden seal in his consciousness sea emitting a flickering golden light.</p><p></p><p>Then, a line of text appeared:</p><p></p><p>【Sharpening (1/100)】: A rather profound skill. Sharpen daily, and the iron rod will become a needle. Persevere, and there will be rewards!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this line of text, Zhou You could not help but raise his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>He had not expected that sharpening a sword would actually record a skill called 【Sharpening】, and it was the first "profound" level skill he had recorded in a long time!</p><p></p><p>From Zhou You's observations, the skills recorded by the golden seal fell into two categories:</p><p></p><p>One was for daily life skills.</p><p>The other was for cultivation skills.</p><p></p><p>The life skills were also divided into levels from simple to difficult: simple, complex, and profound.</p><p></p><p>Simple skills included things like 【Sweeping】, 【Farming】, 【Chopping Wood】, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Complex skills were like 【Fishing】 and 【Grilling Fish】, which required some technique.</p><p></p><p>And the only profound skill so far was 【Sharpening】. Zhou You wondered what special bonus he might get after completing it?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You thought about it, and since he had nothing to do in the afternoon anyway, he decided to continue sharpening the iron sword.</p><p></p><p>By the end of the day, he had sharpened the sword to an extremely sharp edge, almost to the point of cutting a hair against the wind. If used to kill, it could definitely slit a throat with one strike!</p><p></p><p>However, the progress on 【Sharpening】 had only increased a little bit.</p><p></p><p>The more this was the case, the more Zhou You felt that 【Sharpening】 was no simple matter. If he could complete it, there might be a pleasant surprise!</p><p></p><p>With a clear goal in mind, Zhou You's days after that, apart from his regular cultivation, fishing, and observing the growth of his vegetables, gained the new activity of sharpening swords.</p><p></p><p>And that young sword-flying lady would come to fish for two hours every morning, but even after half a month, she had failed to catch a single fish.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes watching her made Zhou You feel anxious, thinking to himself that this girl was really too stupid, unable to catch a fish for half a month.</p><p></p><p>However, as time went on, Zhou You gradually got used to it.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's peaceful life continued until the third day after the third time he turned in spiritual fish.</p><p></p><p>Just as the 'Opening Meridians Scripture' was about to be completed, and Zhou You felt he was not far from condensing his third breath of qi, the arrival of someone broke his peaceful life.</p>

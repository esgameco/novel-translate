        <h1>Chapter 60</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhou, let's go listen to the lecture. Uncle Liu should be coming soon."</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan seemed to not want to listen to Wang Tiezhu's words praising Lin Feng here, so he spoke to Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You also didn't really want to stay there. When Wang Tiezhu talked about Lin Feng, Zhou You always felt a bit uncomfortable...</p><p></p><p>So he nodded, said a word to Wang Tiezhu, and then followed Mu Jihan to the lecture grounds. </p><p></p><p>"Wait for me, two senior brothers!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Tiezhu followed the two and they found a spot to sit cross-legged at the lecture grounds.</p><p></p><p>There were over a thousand meditation mats in the square, but only a few hundred people came to listen to the lecture, so there was no need to worry about not having enough mats.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You and Mu Jihan quietly waited for the lecturing uncle to arrive, only Wang Tiezhu kept chattering nonstop.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Wang Tiezhu suddenly stood up, waving his hand and shouting: "Sister Jiang, over here!"</p><p></p><p>His shout attracted everyone's attention. </p><p></p><p>Then those people followed Wang Tiezhu's gaze and saw a young lady in a blue horse-face skirt.</p><p></p><p>The girl had her hair tied in a high ponytail, dressed quite simply. Her delicate features, fair skin, and tall stature made her look quite vigorous.</p><p></p><p>"Besides Sister Bai, Taibai Academy actually has such a beauty?"</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately her cultivation is a bit low, only at the second level of Qi refining. Could it be her spiritual root is poor?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I remember now, her name is Jiang Yuyao. She only joined the academy half a year ago and has already reached the second level of Qi refining?"</p><p></p><p>The nearby Taibai disciples were astonished to see the high-ponytailed girl approaching.</p><p></p><p>Some disciples immediately revealed the girl's background.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Jiang Yuyao, Mu Jihan also hurriedly stood up to greet her: "Sister Jiang, you're here."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuyao walked up to Mu Jihan and Wang Tiezhu, smiling: "You two senior brothers came so early."</p><p></p><p>It was evident that Jiang Yuyao had a decent relationship with Mu Jihan.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Jiang, let me introduce you. This is our newly acquainted Senior Brother Zhou You."</p><p></p><p>Wang Tiezhu enthusiastically introduced: "Senior Brother Zhou, this is Sister Jiang Yuyao. She's the only one among us with a superior spiritual root."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhou You couldn't help raising his brows, looking at Jiang Yuyao with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect this young lady to actually have a superior spiritual root.</p><p></p><p>A superior spiritual root may not be as rare as an extraordinary or celestial spiritual root, but it was still considered top-notch.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Jiang."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You politely cupped his fist in greeting.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior Brother Zhou."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuyao smiled charmingly in acknowledgment, very courteous.</p><p></p><p>Then the four sat down, and Wang Tiezhu started chattering nonstop again.</p><p></p><p>From their conversation, Zhou You learned that only Jiang Yuyao had properly entered Taibai Academy by relying on her spiritual root.</p><p></p><p>Although Taibai Academy was a cultivating force of the Great Qi Imperial Dynasty, anyone could join through examinations.</p><p></p><p>However, the examinations had extremely strict requirements.</p><p></p><p>First, those over twenty years old were not accepted. Mu Jihan was already disqualified on this point, but his father was the Marquis of Lin'an and opened a backdoor for him. Coupled with his middle-grade spiritual root and already having the first level of Qi refining when joining, he barely qualified for admission.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown why this son of the Marquis of Lin'an, despite having a middle-grade spiritual root, didn't join Taibai Academy earlier. Perhaps there were other reasons.</p><p></p><p>Next, there were three major examinations to enter Taibai Academy.</p><p></p><p>The first was testing one's spiritual root. Those with superior spiritual roots passed directly, without needing the other two exams.</p><p></p><p>The second was a willpower test. Those with strong willpower and middle-grade spiritual roots could be admitted.</p><p></p><p>The third was a test of one's heart for cultivation. If passed, even those with lower spiritual roots could join!</p><p></p><p>Wang Tiezhu had a lower spiritual root, but he ranked first in the latter two exams, thus successfully gaining admission.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Entering the door.</p><p></p><p>This way, Zhou You understood the positioning of these three people. </p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuyao relied on her talent, Mu Jihan relied on his family background, while Wang Tiezhu truly relied on his own solid efforts.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Zhou, although us low-rank spiritual root cultivators find it difficult to cultivate, it is not impossible. With an unwavering heart seeking the Way, we can certainly achieve something!" </p><p></p><p>Wang Tiezhu said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You smiled and nodded.</p><p></p><p>As they talked, the lecturer also arrived - a middle-aged Taoist priest with a long braided beard. </p><p></p><p>Everyone addressed him as "Master Liu".</p><p></p><p>Zhou You also stood up and cupped his fist to show respect.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Master Liu began lecturing extensively.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You listened attentively to Master Liu's lecture, occasionally someone would raise their hand to ask a question.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, Zhou You found that this lecture seemed to be of great help to him.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You listened entrancedly, and four hours passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"I see now!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You exhaled, his eyes bright, as if he had gained some insight.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Zhou, Master Liu has left, let's go too."</p><p></p><p>Wang Tiezhu said to Zhou You.  </p><p></p><p>Zhou You said, "You go ahead, I've gained some insights, I'll leave later."</p><p></p><p>Wang Tiezhu nodded, "Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Mu Jihan and Jiang Yuyao also cupped their fists in farewell. Zhou You waited until most others had left before heading down the mountain himself.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You first returned to the inn, set up the Minor Shocking Formation around it, then took out the jade slip of cultivation experiences given to him by Zhang Lei and carefully studied it.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Zhou You had been busy improving various skills and had not thoroughly read this jade slip of cultivation experiences. Now, combined with today's lecture content, Zhou You felt an enlightening sensation.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was quite miraculous. Previously, when he was cultivating, he clearly did not feel that there was anything he did not understand. He only needed to cultivate according to the methods, and he could improve his cultivation level. He did not feel that there were any abstruse or unclear parts during cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But now, after reading Zhang Lei's cultivation experiences and combining it with Master Liu's lecture, he felt a sudden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>It was truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You put away the jade slip, pondered the time - it was already the fourth watch of the night, so he sat cross-legged and began cultivating.</p><p></p><p>As he cycled the Long Spring Skill, Zhou You clearly felt that the flow of his spiritual power was faster, and his cultivation speed was much quicker than before.</p><p></p><p>Time passed second by second, and two hours went by in a blink.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You opened his eyes, full of pleasant surprise in his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"My cultivation speed increased by two tenths!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You never imagined that this trip would actually allow him to increase his cultivation speed by two tenths!</p><p></p><p>This meant that originally, for him to cultivate the Long Spring Skill without taking any spirit pills, it would take twenty days to increase one point of progress. It would take a full two thousand days to fully cultivate to the ninth level of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>But now, it only takes sixteen days to increase one point of progress. Without taking any spirit pills, the overall time would be shortened by four hundred days!</p><p></p><p>This further reduced the time for Zhou You to reach the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>"It seems cultivation experiences are useful at any time. This trip was not in vain!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>He never expected this lecture to be an unexpected boon, increasing his cultivation speed by two tenths.</p><p></p><p>It seems attending public lectures is quite beneficial.</p><p></p><p>If there are lectures specifically on body refining, that would be even better.</p><p></p><p>Please all patrons come read this chapter again at 8am every morning, thank you everyone! Also seeking month tickets, recommendation tickets and donations!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The attendant said with a smile, "It's like this, friend Daoist. Tomorrow night there will be an underground transaction meeting. The requirements for attending this transaction meeting are quite strict. The participating friend Daoists all have skills by their side, including talisman masters, artifact refiners, pill concocters, herbalists, and so on. Everyone exchanges what they need and lack."  </p><p></p><p>Pausing for a moment, the attendant continued, "As for safety, friend Daoist can rest assured. This transaction meeting is hosted by the shopkeeper of our humble shop. Currently, there is still a vacancy for a pill concocter. If you are interested, friend Daoist, I can recommend you."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You raised his eyebrows slightly. An underground transaction meeting? </p><p></p><p>And it was one of a rather high caliber, requiring participants to possess certain skills, with only one vacancy for each skill.</p><p></p><p>It seemed the talisman master vacancy had already been taken, so when Zhou You came this morning posing as a talisman master, the attendant did not invite him.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, cultivators possessing such skills tended to be quite wealthy, with abundant materials in their possession.  </p><p></p><p>Naturally, the quality of their transaction meetings would be high as well.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You had no interest in such things.</p><p></p><p>There were no materials he couldn't obtain, so he had no need to attend some underground transaction meeting.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You simply wanted to sell his spoils peacefully, and then purchase what he needed.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he was not a pill concocter.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not interested," Zhou You replied indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The attendant was stunned for a moment, then smiled, "No matter, friend Daoist, please take your time."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You nodded and left.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the inn, Zhou You did not go to Taibai Lane again. Instead, he cultivated at the inn, waiting until the next day to disguise himself once more.</p><p></p><p>This time, he used a body-shrinking technique to become a burly, muscular man with tanned, reddish skin, looking as if he frequently faced fire.</p><p></p><p>He did not conceal his cultivation base either, directly revealing a fifth level of Qi refinement.</p><p></p><p>When he arrived at Taibai Lane, the attendant did not recognize Zhou You and respectfully welcomed him.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You directly slammed the Yellow Light Sword onto the counter, along with some materials he no longer needed.</p><p></p><p>"I recently forged this useless sword and have some discarded materials. Take them all," Zhou You said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>This time, Zhou You did not take out the top-grade dharma treasure.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, Zhou You was posing as an artifact refiner this time. Taking out a top-grade dharma treasure to sell would be unreasonable - how could an artifact refiner at the fifth level of Qi refinement forge a top-grade dharma treasure? That would be too eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this top-grade dharma treasure was precious. It would be safer to hold onto it.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, Zhou You had learned that an auction would be held at a place called "Huangshan Market Town" a thousand miles to the west in three days' time.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You decided to take this top-grade flying sword dharma treasure to the auction for sale instead, which would be much safer.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Daoist is actually an artifact refiner?"</p><p></p><p>The Taibai Lane attendant's eyes lit up, clearly becoming much more courteous as he hurriedly attended to Zhou You, brewing him a cup of low-quality spirit tea and asking him to wait a moment before inspecting the materials and Yellow Light Sword.</p><p></p><p>"A middle-grade earth-attribute flying sword dharma treasure, excellent quality, quite sharp, valued at three hundred and forty spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>"Two pieces of copper and tin ore, valued at thirty spirit stones..."</p><p></p><p>"Three pieces of top-grade iron essence, valued at twenty-four spirit stones..."</p><p></p><p>After the full appraisal, the total valuation came to seven hundred and sixty spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was quite satisfied with this result and agreed to sell.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the seven hundred and sixty spirit stones, Zhou You asked, "Does your esteemed shop sell body cultivation manuals, spirit-viewing stones, soul-shocking wood, and mind-controlling jade - these three materials?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had come here to sell his spoils and also purchase a body cultivation manual and the three materials needed to set up a minor shocking spirit formation.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, the martial arts cultivation in the mortal realm provided very little enhancement for Zhou You. To further improve his physical realm, he had to cultivate body refinement techniques. </p><p></p><p>Additionally, since Zhou You himself had spirit stones, he naturally did not hesitate to use them.</p><p></p><p>As for the pill ingredients needed for cultivation, they were optional for Zhou You. Moreover, he had developed some resistance to the Absorbing Yuan Pill, and the only pill that could increase his cultivation base during the middle stage of Qi Refining was the Absorbing Yuan Pill.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, purchasing Absorbing Yuan Pills was not cost-effective.</p><p></p><p>The attendant smiled and said, "Friend, if you can't find what you need at our Taibai House, you won't be able to find it elsewhere either. Please wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he turned around to retrieve a storage bag and took out a jade slip. "Friend, please look for a suitable technique here. I'll go get those three materials for you. By the way, how many portions do you need?"</p><p></p><p>"Eight portions of Spirit-Gazing Stone, five portions of Mind-Controlling Jade, and Shocking-Soul Wood."</p><p></p><p>Because he had killed the thin cultivator from the Righteous Qi Alliance, he had three portions of Mind-Controlling Jade and Shocking-Soul Wood, so he only needed five more portions of each.</p><p></p><p>The attendant acknowledged and went to fetch the materials.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Zhou You carefully examined the jade slip, but he did not drink the spiritual tea.</p><p></p><p>"Body Refining Technique, Bone Tempering Technique, Essence Forging Skill..."</p><p></p><p>The jade slip recorded six body refinement techniques. Five of them were for the Qi Refining stage, and one was for the Foundation Establishment stage. It also listed the prices and general cultivation directions, as well as the effects after successful cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You only glanced at the Foundation Establishment body refinement technique.</p><p></p><p>The 'Cyan Primordial Body' was a Foundation Establishment body refinement technique that could be cultivated all the way to the peak of Foundation Establishment. Those with a wood-attributed spiritual root could increase their cultivation speed. After successful cultivation, one could attain the Cyan Primordial Body, which had a powerful physique, exceptional recovery abilities, and could extend one's lifespan by twenty years!</p><p></p><p>This technique was good, but it required two thousand five hundred spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You could not afford it at the moment, so he decided to purchase it after reaching Foundation Establishment. For now, he could only buy other techniques.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he chose the Bone Tempering Technique.</p><p></p><p>This technique allowed one to temper their bones and tendons daily, progressing from the first level of Bone Tempering to the ninth level. After successful cultivation, a bone essence would condense within all the bones in the body. When released, this bone essence could condense at a specific point on the body and withstand a full-power attack from an early Foundation Establishment cultivator!</p><p></p><p>The only downside was the slightly high price of six hundred spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"The ability to withstand a full-power attack from an early Foundation Establishment cultivator! That's a decent life-saving skill!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You thought inwardly and decided to purchase this body refinement technique.</p><p></p><p>After a transaction, Zhou You obtained eight portions of the three materials and the Bone Tempering Technique, spending over nine hundred spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he had to take out another two hundred spirit stones, leaving him with only about four hundred spirit stones in total.</p><p></p><p>After the transaction, the Taibai House attendant indeed asked Zhou You if he was willing to participate in the underground trade fair that evening.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You, of course, refused without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the market, Zhou You returned to the inn. After a while, he changed his appearance and attire, checked out of the inn, and headed towards the Huangshan Market in the west.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You still had two things left to do: auction off the high-grade lawless flying sword and execute the plan he had formulated.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You used the Clearing Wind Crossing technique, moving swiftly through the mountains and rapidly leaving the market behind.</p><p></p><p>However, two hours later, Zhou You suddenly stopped in a dense mountain valley, his expression somewhat grim.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I'm being watched again."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You muttered and quickly took out four sets of Minor Shocking Spirit Formations, then calmly set them up around him.</p><p></p><p>This was the advantage of the Minor Shocking Spirit Formation – since it only required three types of formation flags to set up, its construction was quite simple, allowing for rapid deployment and portability.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 53</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The sixth energy channel coalesced above his chest, with golden light flickering at first, then gradually stabilizing, and finally inwardly gathering within the energy channel. </p><p></p><p>The condensed spiritual power washed through all his meridians, expelling a large amount of impurities from his pores.</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou's breathing became more vigorous. </p><p></p><p>His eyesight, hearing, and perception were all enhanced at this moment.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual power rose to a new level.</p><p></p><p>"Sixth level of Qi cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou's consciousness sank inward, seeing a golden seal appear with abundant golden light in his sea of wisdom.</p><p></p><p>The words on the golden seal showed that the "Middle Section of the Meridian Opening Manual" had been fully mastered.</p><p></p><p>This meant Zhouyou could now begin cultivating the latter section of the "Meridian Opening Manual."</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou had long since memorized the latter section of the "Meridian Opening Manual."</p><p></p><p>He immediately closed his eyes, sank his thoughts inwardly, and began cultivating the latter section.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, within the rules of the golden seal, after mastering the middle section of the "Meridian Opening Manual," cultivating the latter section was akin to a different cultivation method that could be continued.</p><p></p><p>It was like exploiting a small bug.</p><p></p><p>After another two hours passed in the blink of an eye, Zhouyou finally exhaled and ended his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou carefully sensed the spiritual power cultivated, feeling somewhat satisfied. He then got up and left the wooden hut. Taking advantage of the fact that dawn had not yet broken, he went to the edge of Erhai Lake and jumped into the water to scrub his body clean.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he recalled the events that had occurred over the past ten months.</p><p></p><p>Although Zhouyou had been busy in bitter cultivation during this period, it was not as if he was completely unaware of outside events.</p><p></p><p>Every month when exchanging spirit fish, he would go to the Inner Sect to gather some news, mainly about Lincheng City and the Wu Family.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the last time the Righteous Qi Alliance raided Taibai Academy and a Condensing Pellet cultivator fell, exposing a Condensing Pellet insider in Taibai Academy and causing one cultivator's cultivation to drop, the Righteous Qi Alliance had become increasingly rampant.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they had been somewhat stealthy, but recently they had begun secretly ambushing Taibai disciples out practicing.</p><p></p><p>Especially in the Ten Thousand Mountains, the danger for Taibai disciples going to the Ten Thousand Mountains to practice and slay demonic beasts had doubled compared to before.</p><p></p><p>However, Taibai Academy was equally merciless, frantically hunting down and killing Righteous Qi Alliance cultivators in Lincheng City.</p><p></p><p>They even set up a bounty list within Taibai Academy, with points awarded for killing Righteous Qi Alliance cultivators based on their cultivation level, with higher ranks earning more points. The rankings were refreshed monthly.</p><p></p><p>The top ten in the rankings could receive rewards.</p><p></p><p>This showed Taibai Academy's determination to suppress the Righteous Qi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, although the young master of the Lin Family, Lin Feng, had gone missing, he did not die but safely returned, raising his cultivation to the ninth level of Qi Condensation. It was said he was preparing to condense his Pellet recently.</p><p></p><p>There were also more demonic beasts in Luoshui Pass than before, with some even claiming to have encountered demonic beasts within the pass itself.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Taibai Academy ordered the Law Enforcement Office to thoroughly investigate this matter.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing else of note.</p><p></p><p>The rest concerned Zhouyou's own matters. During this time, Xiao Yueyingsaw him a few more times. Seeing that Zhouyou's cultivation had not yet reached the first level of Qi Condensation, she was somewhat displeased and urged him on.</p><p></p><p>The last time he went to exchange spirit fish, Zhouyou suppressed his cultivation to the first level of Qi Condensation.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yueying was clearly much more satisfied and even bestowed a bottle of Cultivation Pellets containing ten pellets.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Zhouyou would not use them, regardless of whether they had been tampered with or not. For Zhouyou's current state, Cultivation Pellets were almost useless. He immediately sold them for 150 low-grade spirit stones and exchanged them for a stack of first-grade talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Zhouyou had fully mastered the Blue Wood Talisman and Earth Explosion Talisman, further enhancing his spiritual sense to 220 zhang, surpassing the spiritual sense strength of an ordinary ninth level of Qi Condensation cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he began practicing first-grade talismans.</p><p></p><p>The last time at the Huangshan Market, he had purchased two types of first-grade talismans.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It described the method of drawing talisman formations, which were divided into the Blaze Talisman and the Frost Talisman. </p><p></p><p>The Blaze Talisman was an extremely powerful talisman among the top-grade first-level talismans. When used, it had the force of a ninth-level qi cultivator's strike. However, the difficulty of drawing it was also extremely high. </p><p></p><p>Currently, Zhou You's success rate was only around 10%. Out of ten attempts, he could only succeed once, resulting in a loss.</p><p></p><p>However, he had the mid-grade Green Wood Talisman, Earth Explosion Talisman, and the low-grade Fire Pellet Talisman and Tranquility Talisman to support him. The spirit stones he earned from selling them were enough to fund Zhou You's practice of drawing the Blaze Talisman.</p><p></p><p>As for the Frost Talisman, Zhou You temporarily set it aside for now.  </p><p></p><p>Apart from that, Zhou You's main focus, the Green Primordial Spiritual Fire, had progressed to 52 points. Its temperature was also extremely high, and its size had reached that of a human head, which was quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, because of his daily practice of the Green Primordial Spiritual Fire, exhausting his spiritual power and then replenishing it through breathing exercises, and repeating this process for ten months of tempering, Zhou You's spiritual power had become as dense as that of a ninth-level qi cultivator!</p><p></p><p>After all, this was the result of hundreds of practice sessions every day and three hundred days of perseverance!</p><p></p><p>In addition, there was also the improvement of his living skills.</p><p></p><p>[Lumbering], [Planting], [Cooking], and [Fishing Spiritual Fish - Mid-grade First Level] had all made considerable progress.</p><p></p><p>[Lumbering] had improved the most, reaching 92 points and nearing perfection.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You felt that this [Lumbering] skill should also have some special properties.</p><p></p><p>However, what pleased Zhou You the most was [Planting].</p><p></p><p>Currently, the [Planting] skill was only at 50 points, but its effect on accelerating the growth of spiritual herbs had reached five times the normal rate!</p><p></p><p>In other words, under the influence of [Planting], the growth rate of spiritual herbs was five times faster than usual!</p><p></p><p>One year was equivalent to five years!</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Zhou You's herb garden already had many low-grade spiritual herbs that had matured, and he could soon attempt to refine pills.</p><p></p><p>However, he could only refine the lowest-grade spirit pills, such as the Abstinence Pill.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After reviewing his current situation, Zhou You had also cleaned himself of dirt and grime, preparing to go ashore and tend to his herb garden.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the sky had not yet brightened, but the moon was gradually returning home.</p><p></p><p>Just as Zhou You was about to go ashore, he suddenly felt an enormous suction force coming from beneath his feet.</p><p></p><p>He had not sensed it earlier, but now that this suction force appeared, a massive whirlpool formed on the lake's surface, and Zhou You's body was pulled uncontrollably into the lake!</p><p></p><p>"Oh no!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was alarmed and immediately circulated all his spiritual power, fully opening his six qi channels to stabilize his body.</p><p></p><p>He quickly scanned the situation at the bottom of the lake with his spiritual sense and immediately discovered a terrifying monster resembling a mudfish, opening its mouth full of sharp teeth and fiercely sucking him in.</p><p></p><p>"A high-grade first-level demonic beast!"</p><p></p><p>Upon realizing the monster was a high-grade first-level demonic beast, Zhou You's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>A high-grade first-level demonic beast was equivalent to a late-stage qi cultivator, around the seventh to ninth level of qi cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This mudfish-like demonic beast, judging from its aura, seemed to be at the eighth level of qi cultivation!</p><p></p><p>How could there be a demonic beast here?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was utterly baffled, but in this situation, he couldn't ponder the reasons. He was completely naked, without any magic tools, and it was basically impossible for him to deal with this high-grade first-level demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>The urgent matter was to escape first.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Zhou You turned towards the mudfish demonic beast, shuddered, and channeled all his spiritual power and bone essence, punching downwards.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A muffled thunderous sound erupted.</p><p></p><p>This muffled thunderous sound did not cause any damage to the mudfish demonic beast, but its terrifying noise made the beast hesitate for a moment out of fear.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You immediately seized this opportunity and shot out, instantly leaping onto the shore.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

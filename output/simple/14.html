        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>When Zhou You saw Xiao Qing riding the white jade dragon horse and coming towards him, he was dumbfounded. </p><p></p><p>He had just gone to hand in the spirit fish three days ago and had seen Xiao Qing then. Why was Xiao Qing looking for him again now?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, she was riding the white jade dragon horse.</p><p></p><p>The white jade dragon horse was the spiritual beast of the young lady Xiao Yueyingying, with some demonic beast bloodline, capable of traveling five thousand li in a day.</p><p></p><p>From Xiao Yueyingying's cultivation courtyard to here, if riding the white jade dragon horse, it would take less than the time to burn an incense stick to arrive.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You thought about it briefly, there must be some urgent matter, so Xiao Qing was sent to notify him.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Qing, why have you come?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You put down his fishing rod and said with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>When Xiao Qing saw Zhou You, she visibly relaxed, then jumped off the white jade dragon horse, looking around in amazement, and couldn't help but say: "Brother You, I didn't expect the scenery of Erhai Lake to be so beautiful, you're really living a carefree life here!"</p><p></p><p>This place had been put in order by Zhou You, with a vegetable garden, a kitchen, and his own little world.</p><p></p><p>It made Xiao Qing envious.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You smiled, and because of Xiao Qing, he didn't feel any estrangement from her despite his cultivation of immortality.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Xiao Qing, he would have had no chance to step onto the path of immortal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You said, "If you like it, you can request to reside here for a period of time when the young lady is in seclusion."</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just a polite offer.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing waved her hands repeatedly, saying, "No need, I'm afraid if I get used to it, I won't want to leave, hehe."</p><p></p><p>Next, Xiao Qing finally revealed the reason for her visit.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Zhou You and said, "Brother You, seeing that you're still here, I'm relieved."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You frowned and said, "What do you mean by that? I just went back three days ago, why would you say such a thing?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing's pretty face became somewhat solemn as she said, "Brother You, actually the young lady asked me to come check on you, and told you to be very careful here, and never believe anyone's words."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhou You immediately felt a sense of foreboding.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Xiao Qing's next words made Zhou You's sense of crisis rise even more.</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Bin's corpse has been found."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing said.</p><p></p><p>"Corpse?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You knitted his brows tightly, not understanding, "I heard that he..."</p><p></p><p>"Ran away, right?"</p><p></p><p>Before Zhou You could finish, Xiao Qing interrupted him.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing said, "We thought he had just run away at first, but later we found out that he didn't run away, but was deceived into joining the so-called Righteous Alliance. After that, no one saw him again, until yesterday, his remains were found near a mine five hundred li outside the city."</p><p></p><p>Almost instantly, Zhou You thought of Huang Li.</p><p></p><p>A month ago, the last time Zhou You saw Huang Li, Huang Li had repeatedly tried to persuade him to join the Righteous Alliance, promising all sorts of benefits and a monthly allocation of spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed that this Righteous Alliance was likely problematic!</p><p></p><p>If he had truly followed Huang Li, his fate might have been the same as Zhao Bin's.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You said, "This Righteous Alliance, isn't it just an organization for wandering cultivators? How could it..."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing let out a cold laugh, "What kind of wandering cultivator organization, I heard from the young lady that this Righteous Alliance is just a cult organized by a few cultivators. They wave the banner of helping wandering cultivators to lure in those with shallow cultivation bases. Then they either force them to mine or sell them to demonic cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"Especially people like you fish servants, you're their key development targets. They often exploit your resentment to attract you over, then control and evaluate you. If you can mine, they keep you, if not, they sell you to demonic cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"Recently, quite a few fish servants of clan disciples have gone missing without a trace. The young lady was worried something might happen to you, so she asked me to come check on you."</p><p></p><p>After hearing Xiao Qing's words, Zhou You felt a surge of fear at the narrow escape.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that Huang Li was most likely a member of the Upright Alliance!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was their target for recruitment. </p><p></p><p>First, get close to Zhou You, then exploit him as a member of an aristocratic family, using the fact that as a servant he can never break free as leverage. They want to find Zhou You's weakness and persuade him to join the Upright Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Once Zhou You joins the Upright Alliance, he will be at their mercy.</p><p></p><p>They lure with high returns and trick him into falling for it!</p><p></p><p>It's an outright fraudulent organization!</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Zhou You has the golden token and only wants to cultivate in peace. Plus, he has become more vigilant and noticed Huang Li's abnormality, so he didn't fall for the trap!</p><p></p><p>This cultivation world is really dangerous, making one worry at every step!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You first thanked Xiao Qing, then asked, "Since you knew the Upright Alliance was problematic, why didn't the Taibai Academy take action to eliminate it?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing said, "The Upright Alliance has quite a reputation among cultivators. The Taibai Academy didn't know about it until a few days ago when Lin Feng infiltrated the Upright Alliance and discovered their misdeeds. Only then did they dismantle the Upright Alliance, and everyone finally understood its true nature."</p><p></p><p>"Lin Feng? That good-for-nothing young master of the Lin family?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's expression became a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>Well, well, this Lin Feng is really walking the path of the hot-blooded protagonist's redemption arc!</p><p></p><p>He started as a talented genius engaged to a peerless beauty, but then his cultivation base plummeted, and he became a waste. He was even abandoned by his fianc√©e. This enraged him, and he rose against adversity. Now he has infiltrated the evil Upright Alliance cult and dismantled it, establishing his name!</p><p></p><p>Next, he'll probably slap Xiao Yueyingacross the face.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, that Lin Feng just got lucky. There's nothing noteworthy about him. I don't know why the young lady is so concerned about Lin Feng."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing said disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't comment.</p><p></p><p>He didn't think Lin Feng was just lucky; the other party did have real ability.</p><p></p><p>However, it had nothing to do with Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>No matter how Lin Feng rose, Zhou You had his own path. After leaving the Xiao family, he would hardly have any connection with Lin Feng.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, by the way, this is a spirit pill from the young lady. She hopes you can quickly open your meridians so you can do more important tasks for her."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Xiao Qing took out a porcelain bottle and handed it to Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was stunned, looking at the bottle with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>What did this mean?</p><p></p><p>Giving him spirit pills?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was well aware of how precious spirit pills were!</p><p></p><p>A servant could never hope to come into contact with spirit pills in his entire life.</p><p></p><p>Even the cheapest spirit pill cost more than ten spirit stones apiece!</p><p></p><p>Yet Xiao Yueying actually gave him spirit pills?</p><p></p><p>Telling him to quickly cultivate to the first level of Qi refining?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't think the high and mighty young lady would be so kind to a dispensable servant like him!</p><p></p><p>Was it just because she was afraid he would run away like Zhao Bin?</p><p></p><p>If it were before, there might be a shred of credibility!</p><p></p><p>But now, Zhou You knew Zhao Bin was harmed by the Upright Alliance. Any sensible person would know he wouldn't run off recklessly, so Xiao Yueying had no need to use such petty tricks to keep him in line.</p><p></p><p>So, there was only one possibility.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yueying truly wanted to help Zhou You improve his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But why would Xiao Yueying want to help Zhou You?</p><p></p><p>To the young lady, a servant was just a dispensable tool.</p><p></p><p>Was the young lady kindhearted?</p><p></p><p>Unlikely.</p><p></p><p>A sense of urgency welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You steadied his mind, thinking to himself, "I hope I'm overthinking this!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare show too much abnormality and respectfully said, "Thank you for the young lady's gift!"</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Zhou You asked, "Xiao Qing, did the young lady say anything else?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing thought Zhou You was asking if Xiao Yueying had any other instructions, so he shook his head and said, "The young lady had no other instructions, just for you to cultivate diligently."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 52</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This is the 'Bone Tempering Mantra' that Zhou You cultivated. </p><p></p><p>This was a body refining technique that Zhou You purchased from the Cuiwei Market. It could be cultivated up to the ninth level of bone tempering. After successful cultivation, one could condense a layer of bone essence over the entire skeletal structure.</p><p></p><p>The bone essence was extraordinarily special, possessing both offensive and defensive capabilities. Its greatest function was naturally to withstand full power strikes during the initial Foundation Establishment stage. </p><p></p><p>As for its offensive use, one could condense all the bone essence to form bone spikes for attacking. These bone spikes had a strength equivalent to that of a top-grade magic weapon, though not as powerful as its defensive capability, it was still quite formidable.</p><p></p><p>However, this 'Bone Tempering Mantra' was extremely difficult to practice. During the cultivation process, one had to endure excruciating pain that ordinary people could hardly tolerate. When Zhou You first practiced it, he almost passed out from the agony.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhou You felt as if all his bones had been shattered and reassembled, the pain making his head spin, to the point where he dared not breathe too heavily. </p><p></p><p>Zhou You gritted his teeth and persevered. It took half a stick of incense time before he could withdraw from the technique, drenched in sweat and utterly drained, collapsing to the ground, unable to continue.</p><p></p><p>Initially, he could only persist for a few dozen breaths of time. But now he could last half a stick of incense. This was considered tremendous progress.</p><p></p><p>But for Zhou You, this progress was still far from enough. After half a month of cultivation, he had not even triggered the golden imprint to record it, showing just how difficult it was to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like he had been cultivating for half a month, but the actual cultivation time added up was less than two hours.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that even for the intermediate 'Meridian Opening Mantra', without any enhancements, one needed to cultivate for two hours daily for six consecutive days, a total of twelve hours, just to increase the progress by one point.</p><p></p><p>The 'Bone Tempering Mantra' could be cultivated to the ninth level of bone tempering, so its recording difficulty must surpass that of the intermediate 'Meridian Opening Mantra'.</p><p></p><p>However, cultivating the 'Bone Tempering Mantra' for half a month was not entirely without effect. Zhou You clearly felt that his physical body had strengthened considerably, but more importantly, his willpower had been greatly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"Huff--"</p><p></p><p>It took a full quarter of an hour before Zhou You finally recovered his senses. He slowly stood up, grabbed his clothes, and with heavy steps, walked out of the wooden hut to the edge of Erhai Lake to cleanse his body.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's life gradually returned to tranquility. His daily routine had become fixed - cultivating for two hours in the morning, then tending to the herb garden, fishing spirit fish after finishing with the garden, cooking the spirit fish for lunch, chopping firewood in the afternoon, and cultivating the 'Bone Tempering Mantra' and the Azure Origin Spirit Flames.</p><p></p><p>The sword-shaped magic weapons he had obtained from the storage bags of Senior Martial Brother Fang and others had all been upgraded by one grade.</p><p></p><p>The ones from the boorish youth and Wu Yong were just promoted to top-grade magic weapons, but Senior Martial Brother Fang's flying sword was different. Originally a top-grade magic weapon, after the upgrade, it had directly reached the level of an extreme-grade magic weapon.</p><p></p><p>An extreme-grade magic weapon possessed formidable might, to the extent that it was no longer within the realm of the Qi Refining stage, but infinitely close to the level of a low-grade spirit weapon.</p><p></p><p>With this, Zhou You now possessed two extreme-grade magic weapons, greatly enhancing his strength. However, the spiritual consciousness required to control two extreme-grade magic weapons was also extremely high. With Zhou You's current spiritual consciousness, he could not simultaneously control both of them.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that even at the ninth level of Qi Refining, one could only control a single extreme-grade magic weapon.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You could barely control one.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation was still too low.</p><p></p><p>However, later on, he would engrave all the materials for the Minor Shocking Spirit Formation into formation emblems. Upon successfully and fully recording the [Minor Shocking Spirit Formation] with the golden imprint, he would once again receive an enhancement to his spiritual consciousness, directly increasing its range by fifty zhang to one hundred and sixty zhang.</p><p></p><p>This was undoubtedly the greatest increase yet.</p><p></p><p>The strength of his spiritual consciousness was now only forty zhang away from the ninth level of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>With this level of spiritual awareness, Zhou You was able to freely control an exquisite magic treasure at will. </p><p></p><p>Apart from this, Zhou You had refined a total of eight sets of spirit formation symbols in the past, successfully creating seven sets. Currently, Zhou You had a total of eleven small "Shocking the Immortals" spirit formations. When stacked together, they could already influence cultivators at the ninth layer of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>According to Zhou You's estimation, when he had around thirty sets, he would be able to trap early Foundation Establishment cultivators!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You set up the "Shocking the Immortals" spirit formations around the perimeter, enveloping the medicine field within as well. There was no need to hide the existence of the medicine field, he only needed to conceal its spiritual power. Unless an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator carefully used their spiritual awareness to observe, they would not detect it.</p><p></p><p>As for the Minor Five Elements Formation and the Five Ghosts Solemn Killing Formation, Zhou You was not in a hurry to refine them.</p><p></p><p>To refine these two spirit formations, one must know how to refine magic treasures. Zhou You had the materials, but without the Primordial Spirit Fire, it would be very difficult to refine them.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You decided to wait until he cultivated the Primordial Spirit Fire before starting to refine the spirit formation flags.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Zhou You's life gradually stabilized...</p><p></p><p>After the success of the previous plan, Zhou You successfully diverted the attention Huang Li had drawn out, using Taibai Academy to severely damage the Righteous Qi Alliance. There were no more disturbances on the side of the Yu Yi Retreat.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Zhou You went to inquire and found that the Golden Dan cultivator whose Dan had shattered from the Righteous Qi Alliance had died. The Golden Dan cultivators whose cultivation bases had fallen would have no hope of reaching the Dan Refining stage in this life.</p><p></p><p>No one knew that all of this was caused by just a simple action from Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly, and it was the early winter of another year.</p><p></p><p>Taibai Academy's annual year-end grand competition was about to begin.</p><p></p><p>The cold wind howled as Zhou You sat cross-legged by Lake Er, silently fishing for spirit fish, like an old man in meditation, alone fishing in the cold river.</p><p></p><p>For these three hundred days, he had repeated the same activities every day, becoming accustomed to many things.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was fixed on the water's surface, his eyes filled with determination.</p><p></p><p>Nearly a year of tempering from the "Bone Forging Manual" had tremendously strengthened his willpower. His whole being exuded a yang vigor, the youthful air on his face had lessened, replaced by a touch of steadiness. His well-defined features made him seem reborn compared to when he had just entered the cultivation world.  </p><p></p><p>Half a year ago, his physical body had already reached the sixth level of Body Refinement.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation base was also infinitely close to the sixth layer of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>"Without realizing it, I've already spent one year and eight months in the cultivation world."</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the rippling lake surface, Zhou You couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>After catching a first-grade middle-grade spirit fish, Zhou You put away his rod to complete other tasks.</p><p></p><p>When evening came, after cultivating the "Bone Forging Manual", Zhou You exhaled.</p><p></p><p>Now, he could endure the pain brought by the "Bone Forging Manual" - during cultivation, his face would only turn pale.</p><p></p><p>This showed how tremendously strong his willpower had become.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating the "Bone Forging Manual", it was already the third watch of the night, the perfect time to cultivate the "Meridian Opening Manual".</p><p></p><p>"I should be able to break through to the sixth layer of Qi Refining soon."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You continued his meditation, breathing in the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. A faint golden meridian appeared on his chest.</p><p></p><p>That was Zhou You's sixth meridian, but it had not yet fully condensed.</p><p></p><p>When the meridian truly condensed, that would be when Zhou You reached the sixth layer of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>Two hours was a short time for Zhou You. When it ended, he clearly felt his sixth meridian beginning to wildly condense.</p><p></p><p>The condensed spiritual power converged into the sixth meridian.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sixth meridian began to condense, with a brilliant golden light flashing incessantly on his chest.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Didn't catch a single spirit fish?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at each other, puzzled expressions on their faces. </p><p></p><p>The young man with the unkempt braid widened his eyes: "Senior Brother, Junior Sister Bai has extraordinary innate talents. It's said she has a celestial spirit root. Although she hasn't cultivated for very long, isn't she still the youngest Foundation Establishment cultivator in the academy? How could she not even catch a single spirit fish?"</p><p></p><p>Spirit roots are graded into lower, middle, upper and supreme ranks.</p><p></p><p>But above the supreme spirit root, there are also earth spirit roots and celestial spirit roots, though they are exceptionally rare - said to be one in ten thousand or even one in a hundred thousand.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lei shook his head: "I'm not sure, I heard she fished for almost two months in a certain place but didn't catch a single spirit fish."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lei's words left the disciples of the Taibai Academy completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The unkempt young man said in a slightly dazed tone: "Although Junior Sister Bai has a cold personality and doesn't like interacting with others, in my heart she is perfect. How could she...not even be able to catch spirit fish?"</p><p></p><p>The other young men also nodded in agreement, highly approving of the unkempt youth's words.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lei said: "I'm not sure, but I heard that although she comes from an affluent family, her mother didn't dote on her at home. When she was young, she was harmed by evil people and diagnosed as having no spirit root, so she was treated unfairly. Since childhood she has feared interacting with others, which is why her personality is so cold."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the young men sighed, never imagining that Bai Chi Yu had such an unknown past.</p><p></p><p>It seems everyone has some bitterness hidden behind them, even the scions of great clans.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Zhou You and Wang Ping watched as Zhang Lei and the others rode their swords away, their eyes filled with envy. Zhou You was especially filled with yearning.</p><p></p><p>At the seventh layer of Qi Refining, one could ride a sword.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Zhou You had reached the third layer of Qi Refining and obtained the middle section of the Vein Opening Manual. Advancing to the fourth layer was imminent.  </p><p></p><p>He also had the latter section of the Vein Opening Manual. Given time, he would definitely reach the seventh layer of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>Riding the sword amidst the winds, soaring between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Wang, what unforgivable crime did Huang Li commit that has the entire Righteous Sect hunting him down? Isn't he one of the Righteous Sect's people?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You pulled his gaze back and asked Wang Ping in puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>Wang Ping glanced around before saying in a low voice: "Brother Zhou, this isn't really a secret. The thing is, Huang Li has something the Righteous Sect wants. It seems the Righteous Sect was established specifically to find this thing, but after finding it, Huang Li made off with it."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Righteous Sect's Sect Master Jade Tripod has fallen, there are still other high-ranking members going crazy trying to find Huang Li."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You frowned slightly upon hearing this, then relaxed and asked: "Huang Li is only at the first layer of Qi Refining, right? How could he snatch something from an Essence Condensation cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Ping shook his head: "No, that's not it. The guy was hiding his cultivation. Rumor has it he's at the fourth layer of Qi Refining, and that treasure wasn't taken from an Essence Condensation cultivator."</p><p></p><p>The fourth layer of Qi Refining?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's heart skipped a beat upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>When Huang Li had come looking for him, he had clearly only been at the third layer of Qi Refining!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he was hiding his cultivation even then?</p><p></p><p>No!</p><p></p><p>He must have originally had the fourth layer of Qi Refining, but after repeatedly being severely injured while evading pursuit, his cultivation had dropped to the third layer!</p><p></p><p>After figuring this out, Zhou You said: "Didn't expect he could hide so deeply. If he didn't take that treasure from an Essence Condensation cultivator, where did he get it from?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Ping said: "From what I heard, the reason the Righteous Sect was established was to lure in wandering cultivators and people like us fish servants, then search our bodies for a certain thing. If we didn't have it, they would sell us off. But if we had that thing, then their goal would be achieved."</p><p></p><p>"A certain thing?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You frowned. "What thing?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Ping shook his head: "How would I know? Anyway, this thing was eventually found on a wandering cultivator in Huang Li's possession, so Huang Li took off with the treasure..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The thing ran away, and the higher-ups of the Uprighteous League were caught off guard as well. By some mysterious means, they learned of this news from the corpse of that wandering cultivator.</p><p></p><p>After hearing Wang Ping's words, Zhou You also had an epiphany. </p><p></p><p>If that was the case, then everything made sense.</p><p></p><p>At first, Zhou You was still puzzled. Zhao Yuding, the leader of the Uprighteous League and a pill formation cultivator, why would he run such a fraudulent organization to deceive wandering cultivators?</p><p></p><p>It turned out it was to obtain a certain treasure. </p><p></p><p>It's just unknown how they knew that treasure was in the hands of those wandering cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't dwell on it for now. He cupped his hands to Wang Ping: "Thank you Brother Wang for the information. I'll treat you at the Drunken Flower Pavilion another day."</p><p></p><p>"Haha! Then I'll head back first."</p><p></p><p>Wang Ping laughed, then looked at Zhou You's jade slip with some envy in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This jade slip was equivalent to a promise from Zhang Lei, and among them lowly cultivators, only Zhou You had one.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Wang Ping left, Zhou You didn't rush back. Instead, he first looked at the jade slip in his hand, put it away safely, and continued fishing.</p><p></p><p>Under Zhou You's control, it took half an hour before he finally caught three spirit fish. After that, Zhou You didn't continue fishing and returned to the wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Huang Li's influence far exceeded my imagination. Although no one knows this guy died by my hand, Zhang Lei and the others could trace that I was closely associated with Huang Li before. Others should be able to find out too."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You analyzed quietly, "Although Zhang Lei mentioned he would increase patrols, making it not so easy for those from the Uprighteous League to enter, as long as it's human patrolling, there will always be lapses. I still need to increase my vigilance."</p><p></p><p>The Tao Bai Academy covered a vast area spanning thousands of miles. Their protective formation could only cover a few hundred miles of the inner courtyard area.</p><p></p><p>Places like where Zhou You and others lived were completely unprotected by any formations.</p><p></p><p>So safety became an issue.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You never expected the situation to become so severe.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't complain but instead tried to find solutions.</p><p></p><p>"What did Huang Li obtain that made the remnants of the Uprighteous League so desperate to find him, not caring about exposing themselves?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You frowned as he scanned the small bag.</p><p></p><p>After studying the cultivation world's knowledge for some time, he now knew this small bag was a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>There weren't many things in the storage bag. The only two things that made Zhou You suspicious were the treasure map and the purple-gold token inscribed with the word "Kai".</p><p></p><p>Zhou You took out the token. The purple-gold token was made from an unknown material, smooth to the touch, with a texture like jade but much denser.</p><p></p><p>The ancient "Kai" character inscribed on it, he didn't know if it was related to the Kai Imperial Dynasty or meant "to open".</p><p></p><p>From the looks of it now, those from the Uprighteous League were most likely searching for this item.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Zhou You took out the sheepskin scroll treasure map and wrapped the token inside it before putting it back into the storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the token or treasure map, it was something the current Zhou You couldn't touch, at least until he reached the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>After putting away the items, Zhou You sat cross-legged on the bed, frowning deeply in thought.</p><p></p><p>The arrival of Zhang Lei and the others shattered Zhou You's peaceful cultivation life. Zhou You had to reconsider his safety issues.</p><p></p><p>He needed to rapidly increase his strength.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if the Uprighteous League people came knocking, it would be dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't think the Uprighteous League people would be as reasonable as those from Tao Bai Academy.</p><p></p><p>Most likely it would be a life or death situation then.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You pondered cross-legged on the bed for a moment before having an idea. He began practicing the Lightning Fist technique.</p><p></p><p>Why do others have so many investments, while I have so little...</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

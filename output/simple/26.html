        <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>As usual, Zhou You was fishing for spirit fish while reading the "Preliminary Understanding of Elixir" brought by the Sword-Wielding Girl. This book did not teach how to refine elixirs, but rather popularized some knowledge about elixirs. </p><p></p><p>It covered an extremely wide range. The elixirs introduced inside were varied, with the most basic ones being for increasing cultivation, but it also covered breaking through boundaries pills, returning to the origin pills, healing injury pills, and so on.</p><p></p><p>There were even temporary pills for enhancing spiritual power, strengthening physical constitution, extending longevity, as well as out-of-body avatar pills, transformation pills, and more. </p><p></p><p>Zhou You found it quite fascinating to read, which could also help pass the time.</p><p></p><p>As he was reading, suddenly a sword beam lit up beside him. The Sword-Wielding Girl immediately turned into a white rainbow and swiftly left, not even having time to retrieve the fishing rod, looking quite anxious.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was a bit puzzled and couldn't help but shake his head, continuing to read the ancient book in his hands.</p><p></p><p>After more than ten breaths of time, a few more long rainbows appeared in the sky, then rapidly rushed towards Zhou You's direction.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's eyes flickered as he immediately became alert.</p><p></p><p>Normally, no one would appear here for half a year, but today several people came?</p><p></p><p>Soon, those streaks of rainbows landed beside Zhou You, transforming into a few youths in white Daoist robes, as well as a haggard-looking man.</p><p></p><p>The haggard man was brought by a stoutly built youth with slightly thick lips.</p><p></p><p>"Who was that person just now? Why did they flee upon seeing us?" The stout youth frowned, looking puzzled in the direction the Sword-Wielding Girl had left.</p><p></p><p>The other youths shook their heads, indicating they didn't know either.</p><p></p><p>Only then did they turn to look at Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Wang?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked surprised, gazing at the haggard man and asking in puzzlement, "What immortal elders are these?"</p><p></p><p>The haggard man was one of the fish servants from the Fish Servant Hut, having chatted with Zhou You a few times before. His name was Wang Ping, and he was as thin as a monkey, so Zhou You was quite familiar with him.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhou, these are elders from the Tao White Academy, here to ask you some questions," Wang Ping said, looking at the few youths with some eagerness in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's heart moved slightly as he cupped his hands in salutation, "Zhou You greets the elders."</p><p></p><p>The Tao White disciples nodded, and the stout one in the lead said, "No need for such courtesy." He then scanned the surrounding environment, revealing a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect you to have grown so many things here, managing this place in an orderly fashion. Not bad."</p><p></p><p>The stout youth smiled approvingly. </p><p></p><p>He had asked around many fish servants today, and of the places he had seen, Zhou You's was the most well-maintained, earning a bit of admiration.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You replied, "I'm idle most days, so I grow some vegetables since I need to eat anyway."</p><p></p><p>The stout youth nodded, glancing at the "Preliminary Understanding of Elixir" in Zhou You's hands. Although Zhou You subconsciously hid it behind his back, he had already seen the book's title.</p><p></p><p>"No need to hide it. Being diligent and studious is good. Although you have poor spiritual roots, as long as you walk the path of cultivation, everyone has a chance. Personal destiny is unpredictable - giving up guarantees failure, but trying leaves a slim opportunity."</p><p></p><p>The stout youth smiled as he spoke these words of encouragement.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was stunned for a moment, carefully pondering the meaning behind the stout youth's words. He then sincerely cupped his hands, "Thank you for your guidance, Elder."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhou You quite appreciated this stout youth.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, he had been observing these people. Apart from the stout youth, the other Tao White disciples revealed varying degrees of disdain, though it was unclear if directed at Zhou You himself or the things he had grown.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's get to the main topic," the stout youth transitioned. "I am Zhang Lei from the Law Enforcement Hall of the Tao White Academy. I've come to inquire about Huang Li."</p><p></p><p>Huang Li?</p><p></p><p>Just as expected!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had almost no connection to the Tao White Academy...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>...and had very little contact with the outside world. The fact that the other party was able to find him could almost certainly be attributed to Huang Li. </p><p></p><p>Looked at this way, Huang Li was probably even more important than imagined!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You said: "Zhou will speak frankly!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lei nodded, took out a jade slip, and then asked: "Daoist friend Zhou, let me explain the reason to you now. Huang Li possesses an extremely important object. Currently, many forces are searching for him, including the remnants of the Zhengqi Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhou You couldn't help but show a surprised expression: "Just who is this Huang Li?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lei shook his head: "Unclear. What we know now is that the remnants of the Zhengqi Alliance are all searching for Huang Li. It probably isn't that treasure map. There must be something even more important on his person. And Huang Li's whereabouts are still unknown. We had inquired before - you had a decent relationship with Huang Li, and he would often seek you out when he was a fish cultivator. Is this true?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhou You's heart skipped a beat, feeling a sense of foreboding. </p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Zhou You nodded: "My relationship with him can't be called good. It's just that when I first arrived, he came to this place and helped resolve my confusions, teaching me quite a bit of common knowledge about the cultivation world."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lei nodded, and then began asking some routine questions. </p><p></p><p>Zhou You answered them one by one.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to hide these things.</p><p></p><p>After all, they could easily be found out.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You recounted almost the entire process of how he got to know Huang Li. There was nothing objectionable about it.</p><p></p><p>After listening, Zhang Lei acknowledged it, recording the entire conversation with his spiritual sense onto the jade slip, before ending the questioning.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Zhang Lei handed a jade slip to Zhou You: "Daoist friend Zhou, if you discover any traces or clues about Huang Li, or encounter any danger, you can crush this jade slip and I will rush over as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Pausing, Zhang Lei said: "Rest assured, the academy will increase patrols during this period, and important checkpoints will also be closely guarded. The people of the Zhengqi Alliance cannot easily enter. As long as you remain within the academy grounds and don't go out, there should be no danger."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You accepted the jade slip: "Many thanks, Senior Immortal."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lei nodded, transforming into a rainbow and leaving this place. This time he did not bring Wang Ping with him.</p><p></p><p>In the high sky, these Taibai Academy disciples traveled by sword, crossing the vast Erhai Lake.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, he's just a fish cultivator, not even a disciple of our Taibai Academy. Why did you give him a jade slip?"</p><p></p><p>A young man with a messy braid asked doubtfully. </p><p></p><p>The other few young men also chimed in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Lei said: "Cultivation is about cultivating destiny. An encounter itself is destiny. Moreover, I quite took a liking to Zhou You."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the others said no more.</p><p></p><p>However, the messy-haired youth continued: "Those scions from great clans are really useless. The tasks assigned by the academy all have their reasons. Each disciple is required to submit eighty spirit fish per month so that everyone can condense their spiritual power and temper their concentration while angling for spirit fish. But they just have their servants do all these tasks instead."</p><p></p><p>Another person said: "Yeah, our academy advocates unity of knowledge and action. Whether it's planting rice or angling fish, it all aids our cultivation. All the disciples diligently complete the tasks, except for those scions who pawn everything off to their servants."</p><p></p><p>The messy-haired youth said: "Can't be helped, they are scions after all. I heard their clans donate quite a few resources to the academy every year, so the academy naturally turns a blind eye to their behavior."</p><p></p><p>Pausing, the messy-haired youth continued: "But I've heard that among those scions, only Fish Master Bai Chi insists on angling for spirit fish and planting spirit rice herself."</p><p></p><p>Everyone showed surprise upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>It was then that Zhang Lei, who had been silent, spoke up: "Yeah, it's just that she still hasn't managed to catch a single spirit fish."</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow is an important day for me, so I hope everyone can spare some time to click on and read through the latest chapter. Thank you all!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

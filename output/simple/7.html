        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Huang Li sighed and said, "Although establishing a foundation can free one from servitude, brother Zhou, do you know how difficult it is to establish a foundation?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You shook his head. </p><p></p><p>He was currently only at the first level of Qi cultivation and had not yet experienced the difficulty of cultivation. </p><p></p><p>Instead, he felt it was quite simple. </p><p></p><p>Of course, he also knew that this was because he had the assistance of the golden seal of "The Way of Ultimate Simplicity", otherwise, cultivation would probably be extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Huang Li said, "Do you know what level of cultivation I have achieved after three years of practice?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You hesitated slightly before saying, "The third level of Qi cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Huang Li was stunned for a moment, then looked at Zhou You with profound meaning, "The first level of Qi cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was stunned.  </p><p></p><p>He had often heard people say that cultivation was difficult, but he didn't expect it to be this difficult!</p><p></p><p>Three years, only the first level of Qi cultivation!</p><p></p><p>This was indeed a bit exaggerated!</p><p></p><p>"We are merely of low spiritual roots, the lowest existence in the cultivation world! Human life lasts only seventy or eighty years. I am already twenty-two years old today. For me to establish a foundation in my lifetime is probably just a pipe dream."</p><p></p><p>Huang Li sighed.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The next few days were relatively peaceful. </p><p></p><p>Huang Li would occasionally come over and chat with Zhou You. After a while, the two became quite familiar with each other.</p><p></p><p>Through these few days of conversation with Huang Li, Zhou You also came to roughly understand some basic situations in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>First, the city of Lin where they resided was a border town under the jurisdiction of the Southern Continent, one of the ten major continents of the Great Qi Nation. It was adjacent to the Hundred Thousand Mountains of the Demonic Nation, serving as the first line of defense against it.</p><p></p><p>The Luoshui Pass separated the Hundred Thousand Mountains from Lin City, with the Hundred Thousand Mountains being outside the pass and Lin City inside.</p><p></p><p>Lin City was overall quite mountainous, consisting of more than ten mountain towns. It was controlled by three cultivation clans - Lin, Wu, and Ye - as well as two major cultivation sects, the Taixuan Sect and the Yulin Mountain Manor. </p><p></p><p>In addition, there was also an organization of scattered cultivators called the Righteous Qi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The Taibai Academy was an official institution established by the Great Qi Nation in various cities. Its role was to select outstanding cultivators for the nation and supervise local cultivation forces.</p><p></p><p>Since the Taibai Academy in Lin City was established by the Taibai Sword Immortal, its inherited teachings were more formidable than those of other cities in the Southern Continent. Thus, many disciples from prestigious families in other southern cities flocked to join the Taibai Academy to cultivate, such as Xiao Yuying from the Xiao Family, who was not a local of Lin City.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the most crucial aspect of cultivation was one's spiritual root.</p><p></p><p>According to Huang Li, in addition to high and low grades, spiritual roots also had different attributes.  </p><p></p><p>For example, Huang Li had a typical earth spiritual root. If he could obtain an earth cultivation method, he would receive a certain bonus when cultivating or using spells.</p><p></p><p>Based on his guess, Zhou You's spiritual root was likely wood-attributed, because the light that appeared when testing his spiritual root was green in color.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, if he cultivated a wood method, he would also receive a certain bonus.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, those methods were monopolized by the major cultivation clans, institutions, and sects.</p><p></p><p>There were also some lower-quality methods available for purchase in the market and inner sect, but they required a large amount of spirit stones, which ordinary scattered cultivators could never afford.</p><p></p><p>The "Opening the Meridians Technique" that Zhou You and others cultivated was considered the lowest grade, suitable for any spiritual root but without any bonuses.</p><p></p><p>"Spirit stones..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>For servants like them, being able to cultivate was already extremely fortunate, let alone spirit stones and the like.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, during these few days, Zhou You took advantage of the lack of firewood and went to the mountains to chop some firewood.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, he obtained the "Chopping Wood" skill.</p><p></p><p>The description of "Chopping Wood" was similar to "Sweeping the Floor" - a very simple skill.</p><p></p><p>The only difference was the way to gain progress.</p><p></p><p>"Sweeping the Floor" only required sweeping three or four times a day to gain 30 progress points.</p><p></p><p>As for "Chopping Wood", a large amount of wood needed to be chopped.</p><p></p><p>The more wood chopped, the more progress points gained.</p><p></p><p>However, to avoid appearing abrupt, Zhou You still chopped wood at a fixed time and quantity each day.</p><p></p><p>After finishing his routine morning cultivation and completing the task of fishing for spirit fish, he would go to the mountain forest to chop wood in the afternoon.</p><p></p><p>After three days, Zhou You had stacked a pile of firewood outside the house, and the "Chopping Wood" skill had finally reached perfection.</p><p></p><p>"Chopping Wood (100/100): This is a very simple skill. Chop a thousand pounds of wood to master it!"</p><p></p><p>The golden seal in Zhou You's mind flashed brilliantly, and a line of text appeared.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a mysterious force surged forth, pervading his limbs and meridians.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Zhou You felt refreshed and energized. At this moment, his lung capacity had greatly increased, and his physical fitness was obviously much better than before.</p><p></p><p>The enhancement of his physical fitness also brought an increase in strength!</p><p></p><p>Without using spiritual power,Zhou You's initial strength was 150 jin (around 165 lbs). After advancing to the first level of Qi cultivation and tempering his body, his strength could reach 300 jin (around 330 lbs)!</p><p></p><p>Now that the "Chopping Wood" skill was fully mastered, with the enhancement of his endurance,Zhou You's strength further increased by 50 jin, reaching 350 jin (around 385 lbs).</p><p></p><p>This could be considered a significant boost.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, there was a line of text on the golden seal.</p><p></p><p>[Opening Meridians Manual - First Part (27/100): A basic cultivation technique. Making breaths daily can increase progress by 1. It can be completed in a hundred days!]</p><p></p><p>The progress of the 'Opening Meridians Manual' remained steady as always.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You could also feel his spiritual power slowly increasing.</p><p></p><p>After another three days, it was time to hand over the spirit fish.</p><p></p><p>Early in the morning, Zhou You hurried back to Xiao Yueying's courtyard with eighty spirit fish and also bought some food on the way when passing through the inner sect.</p><p></p><p>There was a certain consideration for only bringing eighty spirit fish.</p><p></p><p>According to Huang Li, for ordinary fish servants who wanted to cultivate spiritual power, it would take at least three to four days.</p><p></p><p>During those three to four days, they would be unable to catch any spirit fish.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating spiritual power, a normal fish servant could only catch three spirit fish per day before becoming exhausted.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Zhou You, who could catch five per day.</p><p></p><p>In other words, under normal circumstances, a new fish servant could catch no more than eighty spirit fish in the first month.</p><p></p><p>Although handing over eighty spirit fish did not meet the requirement, it was barely enough.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yueying would not really dismissZhou You because of these few spirit fish.</p><p></p><p>The initial statement of "handing over a hundred spirit fish per month" was most likely just to prevent him from slacking off.</p><p></p><p>After all, even if a fish servant exhausted all their efforts, they could only catch around ninety spirit fish per month.</p><p></p><p>By handing over eighty spirit fish, Zhou You barely completed the task without being too outstanding.</p><p></p><p>Ever since talking to Huang Li,Zhou You realized the difficulty of cultivation, especially for those with lower spiritual roots. He became increasingly aware that he needed to keep a low profile.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, for ordinary people with lower spiritual roots, it would take three years to condense their Qi meridians and reach the first level of Qi cultivation. Yet, he only took twenty days...</p><p></p><p>Anyone would know there was a problem.</p><p></p><p>So he had to remain cautious.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing Xiao Qing,Zhou You handed over the spirit fish and food.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing was a bit surprised by Zhou You's changes, seeing him look energetic and vibrant, his face no longer sallow, and his overall appearance much brighter.</p><p></p><p>She teased, "Oh, Brother You has become so robust!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You smiled and said, "Over there, I had to do everything myself, so naturally, I became a bit sturdier."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing giggled, her pretty face showing an envious expression, then returned to the inner courtyard while Zhou You waited outside.</p><p></p><p>During this time, many maids and servants came to greet Zhou You and gave him some inexpensive gifts, such as shoes, clothes, and snacks.</p><p></p><p>It was a way to maintain a good relationship with him.</p><p></p><p>After all, Zhou You was now a fish servant and had even cultivated spiritual power, placing him above the other servants.</p><p></p><p>Establishing connections would only have benefits.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Xiao Qing came out carrying a purse and handed it toZhou You, saying, "Brother You, the young lady is very pleased with the spirit fish you caught. This is your monthly allowance from her."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You felt relieved, respectfully cupped his hands, said some polite words like "It's only natural," and then accepted the purse.</p><p></p><p>The purse was heavy, filled entirely with silver, at least ten taels!</p><p></p><p>This surprised Zhou You!</p><p></p><p>No wonder they said that once becoming a fish servant, one's status among the Xiao family servants would rise significantly.</p><p></p><p>Just this monthly allowance alone was far beyond what ordinary servants could receive.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Zhou You was just sweeping the courtyard, he only earned two qian (1/10 tael) of silver per month!</p><p></p><p>After becoming a fish servant, he could earn as much as he did in several years before!</p><p></p><p>At this time, Xiao Qing added, "Also, the young lady said to let you focus on your cultivation. If you have the opportunity to reach the third level of Qi cultivation, she will teach you the next set of techniques."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You replied, "Please convey to the young lady that I will not disappoint her expectations!"</p><p></p><p>Afterward, Zhou You left the small courtyard, causing many people to envy him, saying that he was soaring to new heights.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>On the way, Zhou You showed no signs of happiness. Instead, he felt something was amiss!</p><p></p><p>Especially when he discovered that Xiao Yueying had also put ten spirit stones in the purse she gave him,Zhou You couldn't help but frown.</p><p></p><p>Hope the comments section can be more active; playing solo is really difficult...</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 47</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He saw that the young man with a horse-faced appearance and Wu Yong had already fallen to the ground, their eyes wide open, blood gushing from their mouths and noses. Their spiritual awareness had been extinguished, their souls shattered, devoid of any life aura. </p><p></p><p>The horse-faced young man's chest was intact, and there was no trace of the white fish from the valley!</p><p></p><p>It was evident that everything he had witnessed before was merely an illusion!</p><p></p><p>What kind of illusion technique was this, that could seem so realistic?</p><p></p><p>"Could it be an illusion formation? But how could an illusion formation be set up so quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Shixiong's whole body shuddered as his thoughts raced, analyzing the current situation.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the refiner's cultivation level was only at the fifth level of Qi Refining. The illusion technique cast by someone at the fifth level of Qi Refining could not possibly reach such a degree, affecting him, a cultivator at the seventh level of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>So there was only one possibility, that it was a formation being set up.</p><p></p><p>But a formation could not possibly be set up that quickly!</p><p></p><p>Unless the other party had set up the formation here long ago, and deliberately lured him over!</p><p></p><p>Fang Shixiong's breathing became rapid, not daring to linger here any longer. He patted his storage bag, summoning a flying sword, and then stepped onto the flying sword, preparing to leave by sword-flying.</p><p></p><p>At the seventh level of Qi Refining, one could master the sword-flying technique, but the spiritual power at this level was still shallow, unable to sustain it for long periods. Therefore, when previously tracking Zhou You, Fang Shixiong had not used sword-flying.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, an umbrella suddenly appeared in front of Fang Shixiong.</p><p></p><p>The umbrella abruptly opened, spinning rapidly and shooting out streaks of grayish light. The gray light fell onto Fang Shixiong's flying sword, causing it to lose its balance in an instant and plummet to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"What a bizarre magical treasure!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Shixiong let out a low cry, his movements extremely agile. He flipped and landed steadily, then waved his hand, causing the shield to reappear and quickly enlarge, shielding him in front.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a flying sword shot out from the forest, slashing towards Fang Shixiong's side.</p><p></p><p>"A top-grade magical treasure!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Shixiong's eyes narrowed slightly as he controlled the shield to block the attack of the flying sword.</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>The flying sword struck the shield with a fierce sound, leaving a white mark.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, the shield was also a top-grade magical treasure!</p><p></p><p>"Humâ€”"</p><p></p><p>The flying sword's attack had not ended when thirty-odd talisman papers flew in from all directions, instantly surrounding Fang Shixiong.</p><p></p><p>"So many talisman papers!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Shixiong's expression changed drastically, almost scared enough to wet his pants.</p><p></p><p>He had never seen so many talisman papers unleashed at once during a battle.</p><p></p><p>Fang Shixiong dared not be the slightest bit careless. Without hesitation, he grabbed the jade pendant at his waist, then squeezed it fiercely. The jade pendant shattered, releasing a brilliant light that formed a blue light shield, enveloping his entire body.</p><p></p><p>"Boom! Boom! Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Those talisman papers exploded as they approached, transforming into fireballs that slammed against the light shield, instantly forming a sea of fire.</p><p></p><p>Despite the light shield's formidable defensive power, it now had cracks appearing all over it.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it shattered.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, all the fire talisman papers had been blocked.</p><p></p><p>Before he could catch his breath, another ten-odd fireballs flew towards him.</p><p></p><p>Although Fang Shixiong had that top-grade shield to block them, he was still repeatedly forced back, his whole body numb.</p><p></p><p>"How can this fire talisman technique be as powerful as a top-grade spell of the first rank!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Shixiong inwardly cursed, wondering if this was truly just a refiner's fire talisman technique.</p><p></p><p>Generally, refiners needed fire spells to assist in refining, so their fire talisman techniques were more powerful than ordinary cultivators'.</p><p></p><p>But Fang Shixiong never expected it to be this powerful. He felt that even his top-grade magical treasure could barely withstand it.</p><p></p><p>The scorching high temperature had even formed layers of heat ripples.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Fang Shixiong had become somewhat fearful.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that a refiner at the fifth level of Qi Refining could have so many tricks up his sleeve!</p><p></p><p>If this continued, he would inevitably suffer losses.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, he had not even seen the other party's face.</p><p></p><p>"Leave!"</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Fang gritted his teeth and decided to leave right away. After speaking, he took out a top-grade first-level talisman for spiritual movement and looked at it with some pain.</p><p></p><p>Although the talisman for spiritual movement was also a top-grade first-level item, it was extremely expensive due to the difficulty in refining it and its great use for escaping, since he only had one in his possession.  </p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Fang gritted his teeth, preparing to use the talisman for spiritual movement.</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, a terrifying explosive force suddenly erupted from under his feet.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Fang's expression changed drastically. He immediately wanted to leave this place, but the explosion had already struck.</p><p></p><p>An earth-shattering talisman!</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>With a tremendous sound, it was as if a bomb of immense power had been buried underground, blasting Elder Brother Fang and causing him to somersault through the air, his entire body directly flying out.</p><p></p><p>"Despicable!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Fang quickly controlled his shield talisman to support himself, only then avoiding a too disgraceful fall.</p><p></p><p>But his legs were bleeding profusely, numb, and could no longer be called legs.</p><p></p><p>Before Elder Brother Fang had any time to rest, a azure beam suddenly shot out from the forest!</p><p></p><p>"Another top-grade magical weapon!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Fang's eyes narrowed slightly, somewhat shocked. He never expected that a mere fifth-level Qi-cultivating Refiner would possess two top-grade magical weapons!</p><p></p><p>And also a bizarre middle-grade magical weapon, an umbrella.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, the opponent could actually control so many magical weapons simultaneously!</p><p></p><p>He should know that even at the seventh level of Qi-cultivation, he could at most control only two top-grade magical weapons!</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Fang dared not hesitate. He patted his storage bag, and a talisman emitting golden light appeared in his hand. Just as he was about to use it, a bizarre force violently struck his spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Hum--"</p><p></p><p>It was like a bell being struck forcefully by a wooden hammer on his head.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Elder Brother Fang felt his entire body go numb, standing there dazed.</p><p></p><p>A spiritual consciousness attack!</p><p></p><p>"Puff--"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the Clearwater Sword's speed increased explosively, instantly piercing through Elder Brother Fang's chest.</p><p></p><p>Intense pain spread through Elder Brother Fang's entire body. He snapped out of it, falling to the ground along with his shield talisman, his eyes wide open, his strength rapidly dissipating.</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Fang stared fixedly towards the valley, his eyes filled with unwillingness to accept his fate.</p><p></p><p>"Father, I have ultimately failed to accomplish the task you entrusted me with! I have let you down!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Fang glared with his eyes as he breathed his last.</p><p></p><p>Even in death, he never saw his opponent!</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Zhou You walked out from the valley, quickly collecting the storage bags of the horse-faced youth and Wu Yong. At the same time, he scanned the contents of the storage bags with his spiritual consciousness, then took out their identity tokens and dropped them on the two bodies.</p><p></p><p>These identity tokens usually had markings, so it might not be a good idea to take them away.</p><p></p><p>However, Wu Yong's identity token surprised Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>It was actually an identity token from the Wu Family of Lincheng City!</p><p></p><p>The Lin, Ye, and Wu Families were the three great cultivating clans of Lincheng City. Lin Feng, the eldest son of the Lin Family, was a prominent figure in Lincheng, while Wang Ping was the servant of the eldest son of the Ye Family. And the third family was this Wu Family.</p><p></p><p>So Wu Yong was actually from the Wu Family?</p><p></p><p>And Wu Yong had addressed Elder Brother Fang as "Young Master," so could it be... Elder Brother Fang was also from the Wu Family?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You quickly took Elder Brother Fang's storage bag and indeed found the Wu Family's jade identity token inside. Moreover, his jade token was clearly more luxurious than Wu Yong's.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's gaze flickered. This person had concealed his identity to join the Taibai Book Institute, controlled the Taibai Branch of the Cuiwei Trading Firm, and had even forcibly invited so many pill refiners and talisman masters to hold an underground transaction meeting.</p><p></p><p>He must have some unspeakable secret.</p><p></p><p>However, none of this was Zhou You's concern, as he did not want to interfere in conflicts between clans.</p><p></p><p>So Zhou You took out Elder Brother Fang's jade identity token and dropped it on his body. He then collected all the magical weapons, especially the golden talisman in Elder Brother Fang's hand - this item must be extremely valuable, otherwise Elder Brother Fang would not have used it at the most critical moment.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

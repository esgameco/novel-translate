        <h1>Chapter 39</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Zhou You came before the unconscious Wang Ping. </p><p></p><p>Although Wang Ping was in a comatose state, the corners of his mouth were askew, and a large amount of saliva was flowing out, distorting his entire face.</p><p></p><p>"This is... some kind of spirit-controlling spell?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked at Wang Ping, and couldn't help but furrow his brow. He scanned Wang Ping's body with his spiritual sense and found that Wang Ping's sea of consciousness was shattered, his spirit was unstable. Although still alive, he had already become a walking corpse.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You finally understood why Wang Ping had led the way for those fat and thin cultivators. </p><p></p><p>It turned out that he was being controlled by a secret technique that controlled his mind.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had read about this kind of secret technique in his travel records. It often caused great harm to the victim. Even if they didn't die, they would basically be unable to take care of themselves and become an idiot.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that this was the case for Wang Ping.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You sighed, waved his hand to release a fireball, and helped end Wang Ping's painful life.</p><p></p><p>After Wang Ping's body was completely incinerated, Zhou You waved his hand again, summoning a strong wind to blow away all the ashes. Only then did he turn and head back to the wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You shouldered a hoe and headed into the woods.</p><p></p><p>The bell that the fat and thin cultivators had made Zhou You realize his previous mistake.</p><p></p><p>In the future, he had to be more careful when doing things.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, in this treacherous and dog-eat-dog cultivation world, he could lose his life at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You felt his way through the darkness to the place where Huang Li was buried and dug out his already rotten bones.</p><p></p><p>Enduring the foul smell, Zhou You casually waved his hand, and a fireball fell on the bones, quickly incinerating them.</p><p></p><p>After burning them, Zhou You was about to refill the pit when he discovered that there was a bone that could not be burned no matter what.</p><p></p><p>This made Zhou You somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked at that bone, puzzled and amazed, and quickly picked it up.</p><p></p><p>The bone should have been a rib, but it looked more like a curved sword.</p><p></p><p>His intuition told Zhou You that this bone was definitely not ordinary!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's fireball technique was somewhat more powerful than ordinary fireball techniques, but it didn't even leave a scorch mark on this object, which remained pristine white like jade.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Zhou You pocketed the bone, then quickly refilled the pit and covered it with some fallen leaves for camouflage.</p><p></p><p>It was early winter now, so there were plenty of fallen leaves around.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Zhou You returned to the wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>Back at the wooden hut, Zhou You saw the two stones that had been sliced in half by Huang Guang's sword. Just to be safe, he hesitated for a moment before throwing the stones into Lake Erhai, and then returned.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what this sword bone really is?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You took out the bone from Huang Li's body and examined it. Scanning it with his spiritual sense, he found nothing special about it - at least, nothing he could discern with his current spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he had an unconscious feeling that perhaps what the Righteous Sect was looking for was not that token, but this bone in his hand!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked at it from different angles but couldn't tell what it was. He calculated the time - it wasn't even the fourth night watch yet. So he put the bone away and took out the storage bags of the fat and thin cultivators.</p><p></p><p>These two cultivators were definitely much wealthier than Huang Li!</p><p></p><p>Both were at the fifth level of Qi cultivation, and unlike Huang Li, they didn't seem to have been pursued, so they still had plenty of resources left to use for escape.</p><p></p><p>The fat and thin fellows had quite a lot of stuff on them.</p><p></p><p>So without hesitation, Zhou You emptied out everything from their storage bags.</p><p></p><p>"Swish swish" - a large pile of items spilled out.</p><p></p><p>Talismans, pills, spirit stones, and all kinds of miscellaneous materials, as well as jade slips of various sizes.</p><p></p><p>It was a dazzling array that made one's eyes swim.</p><p></p><p>"Killing and plundering goods, the ancients did not deceive me!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked at these things with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was the first to notice a jade slip on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the jade slip, Zhou You became somewhat interested. If it recorded some incredible secret technique, that would be awesome. </p><p></p><p>So, Zhou You picked up the jade slip and immersed his spiritual sense into it.</p><p></p><p>A large amount of information appeared in Zhou You's mind.</p><p></p><p>"It's not a martial arts technique, but...a letter?"</p><p></p><p>That's right, inside this jade slip was actually a letter. </p><p></p><p>The letter was written by someone called "Meng Xun" to the thin cultivator. From the previous illusion, Zhou You knew this "Meng Xun" was an elder of the Zhengqi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, this letter was more like an order, an order issued to the thin cultivator and the fat cultivator.</p><p></p><p>According to the jade slip, about ten years ago, a white light suddenly flew out from the Sword Testing Rock at Luoshui Pass in Lincheng. This white light disappeared within Lincheng.</p><p></p><p>The jade slip didn't say what the white light was, as such things couldn't be stated.</p><p></p><p>But the leader of the Zhengqi Alliance, Zhao Yuding, speculated that after the white light disappeared, it fused with a certain cultivator, and they needed to find this cultivator.</p><p></p><p>So they started luring wandering cultivators over, intending to find that white light within them.</p><p></p><p>No wonder it was said before that after the Zhengqi Alliance people lured the wandering cultivators over, they had to test them first. This test...was obviously to detect if they had that white light within their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Although Zhou You didn't know the Zhengqi Alliance's testing method, it was clear that Huang Li himself was the one who had fused with the white light!</p><p></p><p>Huang Li probably hadn't just started cultivating three years ago like he claimed.</p><p></p><p>It was estimated to have been ten years.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You took out the white jade sword bone from his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>The white light should be this sword bone.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's eyes flickered as he stared at the sword bone for a long time. Finally, he let out a breath and put the sword bone away.</p><p></p><p>No matter what this thing was or how important it was to the Zhengqi Alliance, to Zhou You, this thing was the source of trouble.</p><p></p><p>Since it was the source of trouble, there was no need to keep it.</p><p></p><p>He possessed the golden seal, so as long as he cultivated step-by-step, he would eventually make achievements, even becoming a top-tier Yuan Ying cultivator was not impossible.</p><p></p><p>So before reaching Yuan Ying, it was best not to stand out.</p><p></p><p>Although the fat and thin cultivators were dead, the Zhengqi Alliance would surely notice before long.</p><p></p><p>You, a small fish from Yu Zhe Manor, what's the situation? Huang Li's disappearance is related to Yu Zhe Manor, and now they've lost two more cultivators at Yu Zhe Manor?</p><p></p><p>This is too suspicious. The Zhengqi Alliance will definitely send more people.</p><p></p><p>"You all want this thing, right? Then I'll give it to you."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's eyes flickered, revealing a cold smile as a bold plan surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Since the Zhengqi Alliance people love causing him trouble, he'll give them some trouble too.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You wanted to cultivate peacefully, but he was no pushover either.</p><p></p><p>After making up his mind, he didn't think about it further.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"This Huang Li is vicious. On his way to escape, he even killed Yuding Zhenren's son."</p><p></p><p>After reading the jade slip, Zhou You muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>The elder Meng Xun also mentioned in the jade slip that when Huang Li was fleeing, he ambushed Yuding's already severely injured son and stole his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Zhou You had wondered why Huang Li, who was only at the fourth level of Qi Refining, could obtain the treasure trove of Zhao Yuding, a Yuan Ding Zhenren.</p><p></p><p>It must be that the mysterious token and the treasure map were obtained from Yuding's son.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You crushed the jade slip and looked at the dazzling array of spoils on the ground, beginning to take stock of them in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

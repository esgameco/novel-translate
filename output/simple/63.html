        <h1>Chapter 63</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This Five Ghosts Solemn Killing Formation is a Qi Condensation stage formation that could not be seen in the Tian Gong Ancient Formation book before Zhou You's journey. </p><p></p><p>One needs to reach the late Qi Condensation stage spiritual sense to be qualified to see this formation.</p><p></p><p>Later, Bai Chi Yu secretly made imprints of this formation, as well as three Foundation Establishment stage formations, and gave them to Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>It's clear that among the three Foundation Establishment formations, the Minor Shocking Spirit Formation can be set up in the early Qi Condensation stage, the Minor Five Phases Formation requires the middle Qi Condensation stage, while the Five Ghosts Solemn Killing Formation needs the late Qi Condensation stage to learn.</p><p></p><p>From this, the Five Ghosts Solemn Killing Formation is obviously more powerful.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this is indeed the case. </p><p></p><p>The Five Ghosts Solemn Killing Formation can also be called the Five Corpses Solemn Killing Formation, and its refining method is somewhat evil.</p><p></p><p>There are two methods. One is to find five corpses of cultivators, refine them into corpse puppets, and engrave the formation and seals on their bodies during the refining process to form the Five Ghosts Solemn Killing Formation.</p><p></p><p>With this method, the stronger the cultivation bases of the corpses were in their previous lives, the greater the power of this formation.</p><p></p><p>If five corpses at the Yuan Ying stage could be obtained, theoretically they could deal with late Yuan Ying stage cultivators, provided someone helps Zhou You refine these five corpses.</p><p></p><p>But there is another method, which is to refine five Yin Spirit puppets using puppet techniques to replace the corpse puppets.</p><p></p><p>However, the Yin Spirit puppets have a fixed level of power. No matter how they are refined, their highest cultivation base is only the ninth level of Qi Condensation. After combining forces to form the Five Ghosts Solemn Killing Formation, they can kill early Foundation Establishment cultivators at most.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Zhou You can only refine puppets.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, refining puppets is quite difficult. Zhou You used up all the materials he bought, but only managed to refine an incomplete half-puppet, and could not even store it with his golden imprint.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You summarized the reasons and ultimately determined that puppet techniques are not as simple as refining the Five Phases Flags, where success is guaranteed by just following the steps.</p><p></p><p>This thing has a very complex structure that requires refining various components and then assembling them, with intricate arrays connecting the components.</p><p></p><p>To successfully refine it, he must have the guidance of a puppet technique inheritance.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, Zhou You does not have that currently.</p><p></p><p>He has no choice but to give up on it temporarily.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You plans to first practice talisman scripting, exchange for more spirit stones, and then purchase a puppet technique inheritance to learn puppet techniques.</p><p></p><p>Only then can he successfully refine the Yin Spirit puppets.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You is quite looking forward to this Five Ghosts Solemn Killing Formation.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the "Formation Mastery" trait only allows him to reach the third level with formations at the same level as the Minor Shocking Spirit Formation.</p><p></p><p>Practicing other ordinary formations is useless. Zhou You tried one called the "Phantasm Formation", but it was indeed useless, only slightly increasing his spiritual sense strength.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Since he currently has no opportunity to refine the Yin Spirit puppets, Zhou You spent more time practicing the Azure Primordial Spiritual Fire and other living techniques.</p><p></p><p>One month after advancing to the seventh level of Qi Condensation, Zhou You's Azure Primordial Spiritual Fire was finally perfected!</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of practice sessions every day!</p><p></p><p>Over a year of perseverance!</p><p></p><p>The Azure Primordial Spiritual Fire is finally perfected!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Zhou You can confirm that the Azure Primordial Spiritual Fire can harm Foundation Establishment cultivators!</p><p></p><p>For Zhou You, this is undoubtedly another great boost.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, after perfecting the Azure Primordial Spiritual Fire, Zhou You's spiritual sense made a qualitative leap!</p><p></p><p>Breaking through existing shackles, it reached the early Foundation Establishment level.</p><p></p><p>A range of five miles!</p><p></p><p>The more effort put in, the more remarkable the gains.</p><p></p><p>A Foundation Establishment spiritual sense brings Zhou You too many conveniences. Concealing his cultivation base is the foundation, and it also greatly aids in pill refining, artifact forging, and talisman scripting.</p><p></p><p>In battle, the stronger the spiritual sense, the more dharma artifacts can be controlled, naturally giving him more advantages.</p><p></p><p>With a Foundation Establishment spiritual sense, Zhou You can even attempt to draw second-grade talismans.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the success rate is not guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Zhou You drew a few Blaze Talismans. Sure enough, the success rate improved quite a bit. Previously there was already over a 20% success rate, but now it was close to 40%. </p><p></p><p>With this, after the Blaze Talisman was perfected in the Golden Imprint, he could try drawing second-tier talismans.</p><p></p><p>Those were the talismans used in the Foundation Establishment realm!</p><p></p><p>So Zhou You began drawing Blaze Talismans. </p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You had only drawn a few talismans when he suddenly sensed an anomaly outside the door. With his divine sense, he waved his hand and opened the wooden door.</p><p></p><p>Then, a stream of light rushed in and fell into Zhou You's hand, transforming into a yellow talisman.</p><p></p><p>A Voice Transmission Talisman!</p><p></p><p>Looking at this Voice Transmission Talisman, Zhou You's gaze was somewhat puzzled. </p><p></p><p>The only ones who could transmit their voice to him were Wang Tiezhu or Mu Jihan.</p><p></p><p>Recently, demonic beasts had frequently appeared in the region, so the disciples of the Tao Bai Academy all shouldered the responsibility of slaying demons. To reduce casualties, the Tao Bai Academy distributed Voice Transmission Talismans to disciples every month.</p><p></p><p>These Voice Transmission Talismans were consumable talismans that came in pairs of two. Each person held one, so they could contact each other in critical moments.  </p><p></p><p>Previously, when Zhou You went to the Tao Bai Academy to lecture, Wang Tiezhu and Mu Jihan had both given him a Voice Transmission Talisman. So if they wanted to contact Zhou You, they could use the talisman in their possession.</p><p></p><p>As long as Zhou You was within a thousand miles, he could receive the voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You took the Voice Transmission Talisman and scanned it with his divine sense, hearing the voice inside.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Zhou, save me!"</p><p></p><p>The voice was hurried and carried a hint of panic - it was Wang Tiezhu's voice.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You frowned. What was going on?</p><p></p><p>Wang Tiezhu was calling for help?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You listened carefully, but that was the only sentence.</p><p></p><p>Besides that, he couldn't hear any other sounds.</p><p></p><p>Who was trying to harm Wang Tiezhu?</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, Wang Tiezhu had only reached the first level of Qi Condensation, so he had nothing worth coveting.  </p><p></p><p>Moreover, Wang Tiezhu would only stay at the Tao Bai Academy. If someone wanted to harm him, it could only be someone from the Tao Bai Academy!</p><p></p><p>Who would dare harm someone at the Tao Bai Academy?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>He held the Voice Transmission Talisman and shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>First, he didn't know where Wang Tiezhu was, so he couldn't launch a rescue.</p><p></p><p>Second, Zhou You had only met Wang Tiezhu a few times and couldn't even call him a friend. They only saw each other during Zhou You's public lectures. Zhou You couldn't just disregard everything to go rescue Wang Tiezhu.</p><p></p><p>If Wang Tiezhu did encounter some difficulty and needed Zhou You's help, and it was within Zhou You's capabilities, Zhou You would be happy to assist him without revealing his own cultivation level and trump cards.</p><p></p><p>But in this situation, with just a Voice Transmission Talisman, how could Zhou You help him?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You sighed and put away the Voice Transmission Talisman, then continued drawing talismans.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't know if it was because of the Voice Transmission Talisman's influence, but this time Zhou You couldn't calm his mind, failing to draw even two Blaze Talismans.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You frowned slightly, and eventually gave up drawing talismans. Instead, he went outside to the herbal garden and began tending to it.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? I didn't expect that Planting had already reached 96 points of progress. It seems it will be perfected soon."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You noticed the information about Planting on the Golden Imprint and revealed a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>Planting was one of the life skills Zhou You valued the most. Its performance was astonishing, able to catalyze spirit herbs and alter the rules of time!</p><p></p><p>If Planting also had special properties, he didn't know how powerful they would be.</p><p></p><p>Now that Planting's progress was at 96 points, its catalyzing ability had reached nine times the normal rate. If it was perfected, it should be able to reach ten times the catalyzing ability.</p><p></p><p>In other words, one year of spirit herb cultivation would be equivalent to ten years of growth!</p><p></p><p>Ten years would be equivalent to a hundred years!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

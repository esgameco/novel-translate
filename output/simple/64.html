        <h1>Chapter 64</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After tending to the medicinal field, Zhou You returned to the wooden hut and began cultivating the 'Bone Tempering Manual'.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Zhou You's body refining realm was at the peak of the seventh level of Bone Tempering, and he could step into the eighth level of Bone Tempering at any time. </p><p></p><p>Therefore, during this period, Zhou You was even more diligent in cultivating the 'Bone Tempering Manual'.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after several days, Zhou You's progress in the 'Bone Tempering Manual' reached 50 points, and his body refining realm broke through, entering the eighth level of Bone Tempering.</p><p></p><p>The eighth level of Bone Tempering was equivalent to the eighth level of Qi refining in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that my body refining realm may advance to the Foundation Establishment stage earlier than my cultivation realm."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's eyes flickered, and he muttered, "If I can quickly step into the Foundation Establishment stage in body refining, it will also give me additional self-defense capabilities."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Zhou You did not dwell on it further and continued to sense the enhancement of his physical body.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the eighth level of Bone Tempering, Zhou You clearly felt that the strength throughout his body had increased by about three times. With a light clench of his fist, he could hear the "crackling" sound of his bones.</p><p></p><p>But that was not the most important thing.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing was the bone yuan on the surface of Zhou You's bones!</p><p></p><p>Through inner vision, he could see a white luminous membrane attached to the surface of all his bones, which was the unique bone yuan of the 'Bone Tempering Manual'.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the bone yuan could protect the bones when stationary, but it could also be mobilized for attack and defense.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, it provided defense. When the 'Bone Tempering Manual' was fully mastered, it could withstand a full-force strike from an early Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's current bone yuan could only withstand attacks from the ninth level of Qi refining.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the enhancement of his physical strength came to an end. Zhou You moved his body and then went to Erhai Lake to cleanse himself.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not dare to enter Erhai Lake carelessly now and instead used a wooden barrel to draw water for cleaning his body.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the last time he discovered and slew the mudfish demon in Erhai Lake, Zhou You had become more cautious.</p><p></p><p>He guessed that the Righteous Qi Alliance must have also released demonic beasts into Erhai Lake.</p><p></p><p>Although the demonic beasts released by the Righteous Qi Alliance seemed to be only ordinary first-grade demonic beasts for now, which Zhou You was not afraid of, there might be hidden second-grade demonic beasts, which would be troublesome.</p><p></p><p>After cleansing his body, Zhou You returned to the wooden hut to continue cultivating.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Two days later, Zhou You once again came to the inner sect at the foot of Taibai Academy's mountain gate and stayed at the inn.</p><p></p><p>The next day would be another public lecture at Taibai Academy.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Zhou You had inquired and learned that this public lecture was a major annual event, and the lecturer would be a Pseudo-Pill Formation expert. Even some Foundation Establishment cultivators would come to listen to the lecture.</p><p></p><p>A Pseudo-Pill Formation cultivator was one who had reached the peak of the Foundation Establishment stage and had one foot in the Pill Formation stage.</p><p></p><p>So Zhou You had to attend this public lecture no matter what.</p><p></p><p>After more than half a year of listening to lectures, Zhou You's speed of cultivating the 'Longevity Scripture' had increased from the initial twenty days for one point of progress to the current fourteen days for one point.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation speed had improved by thirty percent.</p><p></p><p>Since this was an annual public lecture, there might be even more gains.</p><p></p><p>Early in the morning, Zhou You left the inner sect and came to the mountain gate of Taibai Academy.</p><p></p><p>There were many cultivators coming and going in the sky, and there were already quite a few figures on the ancient road up the mountain.</p><p></p><p>This lecture was more grand than any previous one, and even many Taibai Academy disciples who were out traveling had rushed back.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You also saw that many people were missing arms and legs, and quite a few were already injured.</p><p></p><p>From this, one could see the dire situation within the region.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You withdrew his thoughts and began ascending the mountain.</p><p></p><p>When Zhou You arrived at the lecture grounds, the entire square was already packed with at least a thousand people!</p><p></p><p>Most of them were at the Qi refining stage, with only a very few Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Those Foundation Establishment cultivators were like the brightest stars, surrounded by the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>A large number of qi cultivation disciples wanted to curry favor with him. </p><p></p><p>Zhou You first glanced at the two wanted posters, the rankings hadn't changed much, then he walked over and stood by the side, silently waiting.</p><p></p><p>There were definitely no seats available now, he could only stand.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment,Zhou You heard a familiar voice.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhou, over here! I saved you a spot!" </p><p></p><p>Zhou You was stunned for a moment, he looked up and saw Wang Tiezhu waving at him.</p><p></p><p>What was going on?</p><p></p><p>Wang Tiezhu...was still alive?</p><p></p><p>Then what was that voice transmission talisman before?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that someone was just playing a trick on him?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You walked over to Wang Tiezhu and saw Mu Jihan and Jiang Yuyao sitting nearby. Next to Jiang Yuyao was a cushion, obviously reserved forZhou You.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Zhou, long time no see."</p><p>"Brother Zhou."</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan and Jiang Yuyao greetedZhou You with cupped fists, their attitudes very amiable.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You smiled and nodded at them, returning their greetings one by one.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at Wang Tiezhu: "Junior Brother Wang, you..."</p><p></p><p>Wang Tiezhu looked puzzled: "Brother Zhou, what about me? Do I have something on my face? Hurry and sit down, Sister Jiang had to fend off so many people with her glares to save this spot for you!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You put aside his doubts and sat down next to Jiang Yuyao: "Thank you, Sister Jiang."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuyao smiled sweetly: "It was no trouble at all."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't say anything more, just sat there waiting, but his mind was on Wang Tiezhu, trying to figure out if there was anything different about him compared to before.</p><p></p><p>From the probing just now, it seemed Wang Tiezhu was completely unaware of the voice transmission talisman incident.</p><p></p><p>So what was really going on?</p><p></p><p>It seemed there were only two possibilities now.</p><p></p><p>First, that voice transmission talisman was just a prank, something Wang Tiezhu had purposely done and was now pretending not to know about.</p><p></p><p>Second, it was possible that Wang Tiezhu had his body possessed, it was still his physical body, but the person inside was no longer him.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You remembered reading accounts of body possession in travel logs and some books.</p><p></p><p>Body possession was not uncommon in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Zhou You observed that Wang Tiezhu's cultivation had reached the second level of qi refining, and was approaching the third level.</p><p></p><p>This was abnormal. Wang Tiezhu only had an inferior spiritual root, and it had only been a little over a year since he started cultivating, yet he was almost at the third level of qi refining?</p><p></p><p>His speed was hardly inferior to those with superior spiritual roots.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You became secretly wary.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Zhou, you really are diligent in your cultivation. It's so hard to see you these days," said Mu Jihan with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked helpless: "I have no choice, with my low spiritual root quality, if I don't work hard, I may never be able to form my foundation in this lifetime."</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan smiled and changed the subject.</p><p></p><p>Then they started chatting about other things.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You noticed something rather subtle.</p><p></p><p>It was Mu Jihan who was doing most of the talking today, not Wang Tiezhu.</p><p></p><p>You had to know, in the past when the four of them were together, the most excited one was always Wang Tiezhu, chattering non-stop about all the strange happenings in the cultivation world of Lincheng.</p><p></p><p>He was like an encyclopedia on legs.</p><p></p><p>But today, it was Mu Jihan saying all those things.</p><p></p><p>And Zhou You keenly sensed that Mu Jihan no longer seemed to have that disdainful attitude towards Wang Tiezhu anymore.</p><p></p><p>Starting tomorrow, there will be an update every day at midnight. For those used to reading in the morning, you can read it then too, no problem. I hope you all continue to support me - follow along and leave some free recommendation votes every day. If you're able, you can also give some tips, even just one or two yuan is appreciated. Thank you very much, I bow to you all!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

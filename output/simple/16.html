        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Luckily I didn't listen to Huang Li's bewitchment back then, otherwise I would have been flayed alive by the Righteous League!"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, Huang Li came looking for me too back then. Fortunately, I was steadfast in my beliefs and didn't listen to him!" </p><p></p><p>"I never expected the Righteous League to actually be an evil cult organization. I heard that many Taoists who were sold to the demon cultivators were either refined into corpse puppets or had their hearts and livers dug out for cultivation - it's absolutely horrifying!"</p><p></p><p>"Everyone needs to be careful recently. I heard that although the Righteous League was annihilated, that cunning bastard Huang Li managed to escape. I'm afraid he'll come after us for trouble!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, the young master of the Lin family will definitely capture him!"</p><p></p><p>The four fish servants spoke one after another, each with an expression of lingering fear.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that Huang Li had not only approached Zhou You, but had made contact with and tried to lure almost all the fish servants.</p><p></p><p>From their conversation, it could be learned that some fish servants were bewitched by Huang Li and followed him, never to return again.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhou, didn't that bastard Huang Li approach you?" </p><p></p><p>At this point, a fish servant as thin as a monkey looked towards Zhou You and couldn't help asking.</p><p></p><p>This person was named Wang Ping and was the fish servant of the young master of the Ye family in Lincheng. He was one of the most senior fish servants, having been here for five years.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You smiled: "Perhaps it's because I just arrived, so I had no value for him to exploit."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You did not mention that Huang Li had approached him before.</p><p></p><p>He was keeping something to himself.</p><p></p><p>Wang Ping nodded: "That's right, you've only just become a fish servant. When he tried to persuade us, you probably hadn't even cultivated your spiritual power yet."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't refute this, only nodding in response.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, they chatted about other matters for a while. </p><p></p><p>Zhou You found an excuse to steer the conversation towards the 'Meridian Opening Manual'.</p><p></p><p>The monkey-thin fish servant Wang Ping seemed to understand Zhou You's thoughts and laughed: "Brother Zhou, no need to beat around the bush. To be honest, when I first came here, I was also eager to find information on the intermediate section of the 'Meridian Opening Manual'."</p><p></p><p>The others all smiled wryly. </p><p></p><p>It was evident that they had all been the same.</p><p></p><p>Although they had not yet reached the third level of Qi Cultivation back then, they were already eager to seek higher level techniques, because they had firmly believed they would definitely reach the third level of Qi Cultivation!</p><p></p><p>But after so many years stuck at the first level of Qi Cultivation, they had given up on such thoughts.</p><p></p><p>What they didn't know was that Zhou You had truly reached the second level of Qi Cultivation and was about to break through to the third level.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You smiled awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>The monkey-thin fish servant Wang Ping said: "Actually, this is no secret. The 'Meridian Opening Manual' is a common technique in the cultivation world. Perhaps it's not available in the inner sect, but if you go to any market street, you can easily buy it for just twenty spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhou You revealed a bitter smile: "Twenty spirit stones? It would take us over ten years to save up that much."</p><p></p><p>Wang Ping shrugged: "Who says it's not? In fact, Brother Zhou, you don't need to think so much about it. In a few more years, you'll be just like us. Why bother thinking about such distant matters?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps so."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You nodded.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Zhou You chatted with them for a while longer before finding an excuse to leave.</p><p></p><p>Huang Li's escape had once again raised a sense of crisis within Zhou You.  </p><p></p><p>Normally, Huang Li was merely a cultivator at the first level of Qi Cultivation. Zhou You, about to reach the third level, should not be afraid of him at all.</p><p></p><p>But Zhou You always felt that there was something unusual about Huang Li.</p><p></p><p>A recruiter for the Righteous League would absolutely not reveal all his secrets.</p><p></p><p>Although the other party might not necessarily come looking for him, Zhou You felt he still needed to remain cautious.</p><p></p><p>Back in the wooden hut, after some thought, before lying down to rest, Zhou You found two porcelain bottles, placing one above the door and one above the window.</p><p></p><p>This way, whether someone tried to enter through the window or the door, they would break the porcelain bottles and alert Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, nothing happened that night.</p><p></p><p>Over the next two days, Zhou You also did not encounter Huang Li.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Huang Li had no intention of coming to look for him.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps Huang Li was currently busy fleeing for his life.</p><p></p><p>After all, at this moment, all the cultivators in Lincheng were hunting for Huang Li.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Life gradually returned to tranquility.</p><p></p><p>During these days, Zhou You noticed that after the sword-wielding maiden used her magic to catch a bubbling spirit fish, she did not return again.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You did not particularly care about this.</p><p></p><p>It was more peaceful without anyone coming around.</p><p></p><p>On this morning, Zhou You followed his usual routine...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He cultivated with a glimmer of hope in his heart. </p><p></p><p>After this cultivation session, the progress of the 'Opening the Meridians Manual' would also be completed. He didn't know if Zhou You's guess would come true - whether he would advance to the third level of Qi cultivation!</p><p></p><p>Two hours later.</p><p></p><p>The golden light on Zhou You's right leg surged, and a winding meridian channel appeared, gradually solidifying!</p><p></p><p>The third meridian channel had condensed!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's cultivation level rose accordingly!</p><p></p><p>The third level of Qi cultivation, achieved!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You clearly felt that the spiritual power within his body had exploded threefold again!</p><p></p><p>A powerful sensation welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Besides this, Zhou You also sensed that everything within a radius of fifty zhang was clearly displayed in his mind - it was an extraordinary feeling.</p><p></p><p>"This...is the spiritual sense?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You closed his eyes and carefully experienced the wonders of the spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>The third level of Qi cultivation could give birth to the spiritual sense, but according to the 'Opening the Meridians Manual', the spiritual sense at this level could only cover about one zhang.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You's spiritual sense had a width of five zhang!</p><p></p><p>"Could it be because my spiritual power is stronger than others at the same level?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You thought of the spiritual power enhancement from the [Sweeping] skill.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that spiritual power was the spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>Thinking carefully, perhaps it was really because of the enhancement from [Sweeping] that Zhou You's spiritual sense was so strong!</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation world, the stronger one's spiritual sense, the more benefits there were - controlling magical artifacts, pill refining, talisman drawing, spell casting speed, resisting illusions, all would be helped!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the third level of Qi cultivation already allowed the use of spells, which was a qualitative leap in the Qi cultivation realm.</p><p></p><p>It was just a pity that Zhou You didn't have any spells to learn.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Zhou You really wanted to experience the power of spells.</p><p></p><p>[Opening the Meridians Manual: First Part (100/100) - A basic cultivation manual. Exhaling and inhaling daily increases progress by 1. Can be completed in 100 days.]</p><p></p><p>Looking at the words on the golden imprint, Zhou You was full of admiration.</p><p></p><p>The 'Opening the Meridians Manual' was finally complete.</p><p></p><p>It didn't actually take 100 days, carefully calculated it took 95 days in total.</p><p></p><p>The 5 fewer days came from Zhou You making up for it by eating spirit fish and bitter cultivation. Although after two hours of daily cultivation, his cultivation speed would drop to a normal lower-grade spirit root, Zhou You still didn't want to be idle and squeezed out time to cultivate whenever possible.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I should work hard on the middle part of the 'Opening the Meridians Manual'."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>For the middle part of the 'Opening the Meridians Manual', there were basically two channels.</p><p></p><p>One was to ask Xiao Yueying for it.</p><p></p><p>The other was to accumulate spirit stones to purchase it at the market.</p><p></p><p>Asking Xiao Yueying was impossible, Zhou You was already on guard against her, he couldn't let her know his trump card.</p><p></p><p>He could only try to accumulate spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You already had some ideas in mind.</p><p></p><p>He planned to get some silver and go to the inner sect to purchase a mundane face-changing secret manual.</p><p></p><p>This kind of face-changing technique was mainly bone-condensing skills to alter the bone structure and appearance. Although it couldn't fool high-level cultivators, it wouldn't be a problem at the market.</p><p></p><p>Then he could use the face-changing technique to sell surplus spirit fish at various inner sect markets while disguised.</p><p></p><p>With those spirit fish, he believed he could quickly accumulate twenty spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>After figuring out his plan, Zhou You went out to clean off the dirt on his body and began his work for the day.</p><p></p><p>After fishing for spirit fish, Zhou You spent some time sharpening his sword, raising the progress of [Polishing] to 5.</p><p></p><p>It had to be said, as a "profound" level skill, the time needed for [Polishing] was far beyond the previous skills.</p><p></p><p>The more so it was, the more Zhou You looked forward to it.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what enhancements completing [Polishing] would bring him.</p><p></p><p>After a busy day, Zhou You habitually practiced the Light and Shadow Sword Art a few times in the evening before placing porcelain bottles at the door and windows and going to sleep on the bed.</p><p></p><p>Placing porcelain bottles at the doors and windows had become a habit for Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>In the middle of the night, a figure approached Zhou You's thatched hut and gently pushed open the door.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>The porcelain bottle fell to the ground, making a crisp sound in the quiet night.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You almost instantly bounced up, grabbed the iron sword by the bed, and looked warily at the doorway.</p><p></p><p>Begging for monthly tickets and rewards...</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>For now, this was just some guesses from Zhou You, not knowing whether they were true or false. He had to go to the Inner Sect, purchase some herb seeds, plant them, and slowly observe before he could reach any relevant conclusions. </p><p></p><p>At least now Zhou You could confirm that the skills recorded in the Golden Imprint could be advanced.</p><p></p><p>The "Simple" level skill "Chopping Wood" had advanced to become the "Profound" level ability "Felling Trees", directly skipping a level.</p><p></p><p>After the battle with Huang Li, Zhou You realized that these seemingly simple skills could play a huge role. </p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the reaction and spiritual power enhancements from "Fishing" and "Sweeping", with Zhou You's strength, he probably wouldn't have been able to injure Huang Li at all.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of these two skills that his reaction and spiritual power far surpassed Huang Li's, allowing him to unleash the "Light and Shadow Sword Technique" and severely injure Huang Li with one sword strike.</p><p></p><p>If it were other martial arts, he might not even have the qualifications to hurt Huang Li.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that in the future, I still need to develop these skills more. They should be my main channel for improving my combat strength for now."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You muttered to himself, determined.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At night, Zhou You took advantage of the darkness to dig up Huang Li's remains buried underground and brought them back to the wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>The first thing was that soil-yellow sword.  </p><p></p><p>That was a low-grade magic weapon!</p><p></p><p>It was incomparable to a complimentary iron sword.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked at the soil-yellow small sword, his eyes revealing a hint of excitement.</p><p></p><p>He tried channeling his spiritual power into the small sword. The small sword trembled slightly, then quickly transformed into a seven-foot long sword, emitting a faint soil-yellow glow.</p><p></p><p>This was obviously an earth-element flying sword. If controlled with earth spiritual power, its might would be enhanced.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Zhou You had a wood spiritual root.</p><p></p><p>But for Zhou You, it was already enough.</p><p></p><p>At least he had obtained a low-grade magic weapon!</p><p></p><p>A low-grade magic weapon was worth at least one hundred spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You raised his hand and pointed, his mind moving, and the flying sword immediately turned into a yellow beam of light, its speed extremely fast, instantly landing on a wooden bench.</p><p></p><p>"Pushi!"</p><p></p><p>Like cutting a melon, that bench was directly cut in half, the pieces scattered on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The flying sword then flew back, landing in Zhou You's hand.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You showed a satisfied expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that I have to reach the seventh level of qi cultivation before I can try short-distance sword flight."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You sighed.</p><p></p><p>Sword flight was everyone's dream.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators could roam the heavens and earth, descending directly to the nine underworlds below, or ascending to pluck the bright moon from the ninth heaven above.</p><p></p><p>Back then, whenever that young sword-flying girl came and went by sword flight, it made Zhou You extremely envious.</p><p></p><p>"I'll just call you the Yellow Light Sword."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You muttered, controlling the Yellow Light Sword to fly back and forth again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After playing with the flying sword for a while, Zhou You finally put it away, a little unsatisfied.</p><p></p><p>Next, Zhou You looked towards the small palm-sized pouch.</p><p></p><p>"What is this? Could it be...the legendary Infinite Pouch?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You understood that Huang Li's small pouch was the true prize of this occasion!</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have a very large space inside, containing many things. The Yellow Light Sword was something Huang Li had taken out from the pouch.</p><p></p><p>As a defector from the Orthodox Sect, Huang Li's assets must be considerable.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You tried channeling his spiritual power into the small pouch, immediately sensing the scene inside. With a thought, numerous items fell out of the pouch with a rustling sound.</p><p></p><p>"How wondrous!"</p><p></p><p>The most eye-catching things were the dozens of colorful spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had never seen spirit stones before, only hearing Huang Li mention them. But due to their concentrated spiritual energy, he could tell at a glance that these were spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Seeing so many spirit stones, Zhou You...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The stones, he couldn't help but be overjoyed!</p><p></p><p>With so many spirit stones, the middle section of the 'Meridian Opening Manual' could be acquired!</p><p></p><p>Not just the middle section, even the lower section could be purchased!</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou quickly counted those spirit stones, a total of seventy-eight pieces!</p><p></p><p>"Seventy-eight spirit stones! No wonder they say the cultivation world has many bandits, no matter how much you save spirit stones, it's not as fast as being a bandit earning spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou couldn't help but sigh endlessly. </p><p></p><p>This murderous robbery business was extremely profitable!</p><p></p><p>Of course, Zhouyou also knew that being a bandit was like putting one's head on the waistband, not knowing when one might fail, it was the most dangerous profession.</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou accepted these spirit stones with a clear conscience.</p><p></p><p>As a cultivator at the third level of Qi refining, for Huangli to have so many spirit stones, it was obvious that they didn't come from proper channels.</p><p></p><p>Who knows how many fish servants and low-rank wandering cultivators he had deceived and sold to the Righteous Qi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Now it was fortunate for Zhouyou.</p><p></p><p>After putting the spirit stones into a small bag, Zhouyou looked at the other things.</p><p></p><p>There were many things scattered on the ground, Zhouyou examined them one by one, first looking at the talismans.</p><p></p><p>Although the value of talismans could not compare to elixirs and other treasures that could increase one's cultivation, these things could save lives in critical moments!</p><p></p><p>After the previous battle with Huangli, Zhouyou was too clear about his own weaknesses.</p><p></p><p>He lacked a systematic way of fighting, spells, and combat skills.  He was able to defeat Huangli mainly because the opponent underestimated him, plus the surprise of the Light and Shadow Sword technique, and Huangli was already injured. All these factors were indispensable.</p><p></p><p>If any one was missing, the one lying on the ground now would be Zhouyou himself.</p><p></p><p>Talismans were an important means of temporarily enhancing strength in the short term.</p><p></p><p>The main function of talismans was to instantly release spells, which could play a decisive role in critical moments.</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou picked up those talismans and examined them one by one.</p><p></p><p>In total there were six talismans, it seemed that Huangli had used up many talismans while fleeing.</p><p></p><p>The spell auras on these talismans were all different, all first-grade low-level talismans, equivalent to the full power strike of the third level of Qi refining.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhouyou did not recognize these spells, nor could he distinguish them, so he could only temporarily put away the talismans.</p><p></p><p>Next were some elixir pills.</p><p></p><p>There were a total of three bottles of elixir pills, each bottle containing about five pills, but Zhouyou still did not recognize the elixir pills.</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou's current understanding of the entire cultivation world was still too little.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was talismans, elixir pills, or some basic spells, he didn't know much about them.</p><p></p><p>However, that was because in the past he didn't have any spirit stones, and was only eager to improve his own strength and cultivation, hoarding the spirit sand to purchase martial arts manuals. Naturally, he had no opportunity to purchase books about the cultivation world to expand his knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had spirit stones, Zhouyou planned to go to the Inner Sect in a while to purchase some basic common knowledge books about the cultivation world, to broaden his horizons.</p><p></p><p>These were also very important for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou collected those elixir pills, and then burned all the clothes beside them.</p><p></p><p>Those clothes were Huangli's clothes from the Righteous Qi Alliance, Zhouyou had no interest in wearing them, only keeping a new Daoist robe for later use.</p><p></p><p>In the small bag, apart from these items, there were also a few books, a jade slip, a sheepskin scroll, and some yellow and white objects.</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou first collected the yellow and white objects. Although they had no use for cultivation, they could be used to purchase some martial arts manuals in the Inner Sect, so Zhouyou gladly accepted them.</p><p></p><p>Then Zhouyou randomly picked up a book.</p><p></p><p>It was an account book, recording the wandering cultivators that Huangli had deceived over the years, with their information, where they were sold, and how much benefit was obtained.</p><p></p><p>It was written clearly.</p><p></p><p>On it, Zhouyou saw Zhao Bin's name.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the reason why Zhao Bin ran away was probably because he was misled by Huangli's deception, which made him decide to join the Righteous Qi Alliance, only to be immediately sold to a mine outside the city, for a price of two spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The characteristics of the Light and Shadow Sword technique are speed, accuracy, and ferocity! </p><p></p><p>It strikes from an angle that is deceptive and unexpected.</p><p></p><p>It seizes fleeting opportunities. Sometimes there may not be a chance to use it in an entire battle, but once used, the effect is immediate.  </p><p></p><p>"Puh--"</p><p></p><p>Almost instantly, Zhou You concentrated all his inner energy into the iron sword, piercing through Huang Li's abdomen, severely wounding him!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's diligent practice over dozens of days finally paid off.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You moved extremely fast, not giving Huang Li any time to cast spells. He thrust his sword repeatedly, with no technique behind the later strikes, only needing to injure Huang Li enough to prevent him from casting spells.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was very clear that if he allowed Huang Li to control that soil-yellow flying sword talisman, the only outcome awaiting him would be death.</p><p></p><p>The power of the talisman was something Zhou You could not resist.</p><p></p><p>"How, how is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Li's eyes widened as he staggered back several steps. The soil-yellow flying sword that had just taken flight seemed deflated like a punctured ball, falling back to the ground and shrinking to the size of a dagger.</p><p></p><p>He tried to reach for the small bag at his waist several times, but was interrupted by Zhou You each time.</p><p></p><p>"What technique did you use! How could it be so fast!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Li spat blood, eyes full of resentment as he collapsed sitting in front of Zhou You's bed, staring at him fixedly.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You performed a sword flourish and said indifferently, "This is no technique, but a mundane sword art - the Light and Shadow Sword technique."</p><p></p><p>"What?? How could a mundane martial art have such ability!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Li coughed up large amounts of blood. His new and old wounds erupted together, leaving him completely immobilized at the moment, his eyes filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You did not waste any more time, preparing to finish Huang Li off swiftly.</p><p></p><p>But Huang Li did not want to die like this. He trembled and said, "Brother Zhou, Brother Zhou! Spare my life, please! I'm willing to tell you the location of the Zhengqi Alliance Leader's hidden treasure trove. I beg you to let me live!"</p><p></p><p>"The Zhengqi Alliance Leader's hidden treasure trove? You can take it with you to the underworld."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was merciless, killing Huang Li with one sword strike.</p><p></p><p>He had absolutely no interest in this so-called Zhengqi Alliance Leader's hidden treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You possessed the Golden Talisman of Ultimate Simplicity. He only wanted to cultivate diligently and had no desire to risk his life seeking some treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>This Huang Li had already guessed that he possessed an extraordinary treasure. In Zhou You's heart, this man had to die!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if news of him possessing an extraordinary treasure and having the third level of Qi cultivation spread, Zhou You would undoubtedly face death!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You did not dare take that gamble, so he decisively killed Huang Li.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You firmly believed in one principle - as long as one has no greed, all dangers can be minimized.</p><p></p><p>"Huu huu huu--"</p><p></p><p>The fire in the thatched hut grew larger. Zhou You also realized he could not stay here any longer, or he would be burned to a crisp by the fire.</p><p></p><p>So despite being drained of energy, Zhou You grit his teeth, picked up Huang Li's small bag and the flying sword, and swiftly left the thatched hut.</p><p></p><p>After leaving, Zhou You did not rest, but quickly dug a pit nearby with some rocks. He buried Huang Li's belongings in it, then rushed to jump into Lake Erhai to wash the bloodstains off his body.</p><p></p><p>He did this to prevent the commotion from attracting people from the Taibai Academy.</p><p></p><p>Huang Li was being hunted, so his small bag would likely be recognized.</p><p></p><p>If news of Huang Li's death at his place spread, Zhou You would be in danger.</p><p></p><p>So it was better to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the burning thatched hut did not attract anyone from the Taibai Academy, allowing Zhou You to breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>It was best to avoid any dealings with people from the Taibai Academy if possible.</p><p></p><p>So after the thatched hut had burned down completely, Zhou You went inside to check, found Huang Li's charred remains, dug another pit nearby to bury him properly, and only then felt somewhat reassured.</p><p></p><p>He had been busy all night, and dawn was about to break.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was too lazy to rest, so he simply sat down to meditate and cultivate his breath nearby. </p><p></p><p>Although Zhou You had not yet obtained the intermediate section of the 'Vein Opening Manual', he could still gain quite a bit from cultivating daily.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating, Zhou You clearly felt refreshed with a clear mind and sharp senses. </p><p></p><p>Afterwards,Zhou You began repeating his work for the day. After finishing everything, instead of hurrying to build a house, he went to the fishermen's hut and chatted with the fishermen there. He revealed that last night he accidentally knocked over a candle while sleeping, causing his house to catch fire and nearly burning himself to death.</p><p></p><p>Everyone listened and laughed heartily, making it a topic of amusement for a while. The fishermen all knew about the new fisherman from the Xiao family who almost burned himself to death.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the fishermen's smiles,Zhou You secretly breathed a sigh of relief in his heart. His purpose in coming here was precisely this - to dispel their doubts and lower his image in their eyes. At the same time, it would prevent anyone from becoming suspicious if they discovered his thatched hut had been burned down later on. This was the safest approach.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You found another excuse, saying he needed to go back and build a house, and left the fishermen's hut.</p><p></p><p>After returning,Zhou You did indeed need to start building a house - he couldn't stay naked forever, right?</p><p></p><p>During this time,Zhou You did not touch Huang Li's belongings, planning to wait until after he built the house and the Righteous Qi Alliance's momentum had passed before taking a look at what good things there might be. A trafficker should have quite a few good items.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later, Zhou You finally finished building his small hut. It was about the same size as before, with only one room. But it was built entirely out of wood, much grander than the previous thatched hut.</p><p></p><p>What surprisedZhou You was that during the process of chopping down trees, the 'Way of Simplicity' golden talisman recorded another skill.</p><p></p><p>[Chopping]</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's mind sank as he saw the words on the talisman:</p><p></p><p>[Grilling Fish (86/100): A rather complex study, succeed by grilling one hundred fish.]</p><p></p><p>[Polishing (6/100): A rather profound study, polish daily, constant perseverance will bear fruit!]  </p><p></p><p>[Chopping (1/100): A rather profound study, advanced from chopping firewood, perfect by chopping a certain quantity!]</p><p></p><p>There were three lines of text on the talisman, the three abilitiesZhou You had not yet perfected.</p><p></p><p>Of them, [Grilling Fish] was almost perfected.</p><p></p><p>[Polishing] was the first "profound" level skillZhou You had recorded.</p><p></p><p>[Chopping] was the most recently gained, advanced from [Chopping Firewood].</p><p></p><p>Zhou You couldn't help but wonder, since [Chopping Firewood] could advance, could [Planting Vegetables] advance as well?</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of planting vegetables, the results of my previous experiment are out. Whether watered with stream water or Erhai lake water, the growth period of the vegetables was shortened. Could it be...not because of the water, but because of my [Planting Vegetables] skill?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You muttered to himself. He had previously noticed the vegetables he planted had their growth period shortened by one-fourth. </p><p></p><p>At first he thought it was because of the spiritual energy in Erhai lake water, but after switching to ordinary stream water with no spiritual energy,Zhou You found the vegetables' growth period was still shortened by one-fourth.</p><p></p><p>Looked at this way, it was most likely due to the [Planting Vegetables] skill!</p><p></p><p>"It seems these seemingly ordinary skills possess abilities far beyond just increasing one's strength. Perhaps they have some hidden abilities I don't know about!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You pondered silently, "If [Planting Vegetables] can really shorten the growth period of plants, using it on spirit rice or even spirit herbs would be heaven-defying, wouldn't it?"</p><p></p><p>From now on, he would update two chapters daily at 8am, hoping for everyone's continued support. Thank you.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

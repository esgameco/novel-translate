        <h1>Chapter 50</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Originally, Zhou You planned to spend 2,500 spirit stones to purchase the 'Qing Yuan Body Cultivation Manual'. However, he found that he didn't have enough spirit stones to afford so many things. </p><p></p><p>The 'Qing Yuan Body Cultivation Manual' is a body refining technique used during the Foundation Establishment stage. After cultivating it successfully, one can increase their lifespan by 20 years.</p><p></p><p>However, the catch is that it can only be cultivated during the Foundation Establishment stage. For Zhou You's current state, it would provide no benefits.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Zhou You planned to wait until his physical body reached the ninth level of Body Refining before purchasing the 'Qing Yuan Body Cultivation Manual'. Fortunately, this manual is sold at every Taibai Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>After finishing these matters, Zhou You changed his appearance at the inn and left the market street. </p><p></p><p>To ensure no one was following him, he first traveled south for two hours, then east for another two hours. After confirming it was safe, he headed towards the lakeside hut.</p><p></p><p>Chasing stars and pursuing the moon, he finally returned to the hut in the third night watch.</p><p></p><p>Out of habit, Zhou You inspected around the hut to check if anything had been moved, and found a note pressed under the water jar's lid.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You raised his brows, picked up the note and saw a line of elegant handwriting on it.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for helping me win first place in the fishing contest. The reward for this Fishing Champion is placed under the water jar, half of which belongs to you. Please accept it - Bai Chi Yu."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the signature on the note, Zhou You couldn't help but laugh wryly.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when he was at the Inner Court, Zhou You heard the freckled youth and Senior Martial Brother Fang discussing that two months ago, during the Taibai Academy's annual competition, Bai Chi Yu won first place in the fishing contest.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect this girl would bring over half of her reward to share with him.</p><p></p><p>With a flick of his wrist, Zhou You burned the note to ashes. He lifted the water jar and took out a storage bag from underneath.</p><p></p><p>Inside the bag were 100 low-grade spirit stones and a fishing rod-shaped magic treasure, which was surprisingly a top-grade magic treasure.</p><p></p><p>This made Zhou You quite surprised.  </p><p></p><p>One must know that this was merely one of the events in the annual competition, yet a top-grade magic treasure was awarded as the prize?</p><p></p><p>It was indeed quite extravagant.</p><p></p><p>They probably thought the top places in each event would definitely go to scions of great clans, so the rewards would end up in their hands anyway, hence the generosity.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You picked up the fishing rod magic treasure and infused it with spiritual power. With a flick of his wrist, the fishing line shot out precisely and hit a tree 10 meters away. When he pulled hard, a terrifying force erupted.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>That large tree was easily uprooted!</p><p></p><p>"It can automatically track targets, and the speed is extremely fast...Although the shape is unique, the effect is quite good."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was very satisfied - this was his first top-grade magic treasure.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You put away the fishing rod and processed the fallen tree before returning to the hut.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the hut, Zhou You began organizing everything he obtained from this trip and formulating his cultivation plan for the next few years.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the second day after Zhou You returned to the hut, the fifth day since he killed Senior Martial Brother Fang and the others.</p><p></p><p>Led by Zhang Lei, the disciples of the Law Enforcement Hall surrounded and thoroughly searched the Taibai Pavilion in Cuiwei Market Street, but found it had already been vacated, leaving no clues about the Wu Family.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, they had received news after the incident with Fang and others, and fled overnight.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, a rumor about the "Taibai Sword Bone" spread.</p><p></p><p>According to this rumor, Lin Feng, a disciple of Taibai Academy and the great young master of the Lin Family, uncovered a hidden traitor within Taibai Academy, killed them, and obtained the Taibai Sword Bone from their body.</p><p></p><p>This "Taibai Sword Bone" was the very item the Righteous Alliance had been searching for, the treasure that Huang Li had stolen from them.</p><p></p><p>No one knew the purpose of this "Taibai Sword Bone".</p><p></p><p>Only that the Righteous Alliance and Taibai Academy both valued it greatly.</p><p></p><p>For this, Lin Feng was commended by Taibai Academy, and once again became the center of attention.</p><p></p><p>Another day passed.</p><p></p><p>The outer defenses of Taibai Academy were struck by a huge impact - four Condensed Pellet cultivators simultaneously attacked the academy's protective barrier.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The great battle array, among which was Elder Meng Xun of the Righteous Alliance. </p><p></p><p>The Taubai Academy fought back fiercely, with all the Condensed Pellet elders taking action.</p><p></p><p>However, there was a problem within the Taubai Academy - one of the elders turned traitor, seriously injuring several people from the academy, and then fled with the four invading Condensed Pellet cultivators.</p><p></p><p>As for the Yuan Ying cultivator who had been guarding the Taubai Academy, it was unknown why he did not appear. </p><p></p><p>However, of the four invading Condensed Pellet cultivators, one had his Golden Pellet shattered and was in critical condition, while another was seriously injured and his cultivation level dropped.</p><p></p><p>No one knew the reason for this battle, some guessed it might be due to the Taubai Sword Bone, but the whereabouts of the Taubai Sword Bone were also unknown to anyone.</p><p></p><p>On the same day, Lin Feng, who was patrolling the outskirts of the Taubai Academy, was attacked by a mysterious Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Lin Feng's patrol squad was completely wiped out, with only Lin Feng's whereabouts unknown.</p><p></p><p>The Lin Family was enraged and issued a bounty, searching everywhere for that mysterious Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>For a time, the entire Lincheng was in turmoil, and everyone sensed that a major event was about to occur in Lincheng.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Wu Family in Lincheng.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Family was located in the western part of Lincheng City, and they were the most low-key of the three major cultivating families in Lincheng, with the least business.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the conference hall, the head of the Wu Family, Wu Yande, sat on the main seat with a gloomy expression. His burly figure exuded an overwhelming pressure, and his electric-like gaze swept over all the members of the Wu Family, none daring to meet his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Fifth Elder, I really want to know how Fang Zhi was exposed?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Yande stared coldly at a thin middle-aged man, his tone indifferent.</p><p></p><p>This Fifth Elder wore a scholar's robe and a feathered coronet, looking very scholarly, and his appearance bore some resemblance to that Fang Shixiong.</p><p></p><p>He seemed a little flustered and cupped his hands, saying, "I am investigating this matter, but I have not yet found the reason. There are rumors that it is related to that Lin Feng."</p><p></p><p>Wu Yande slapped the chair with one palm, and with a "boom" the chair was shattered, his Condensed Pellet cultivation bursting out. Except for a few people, the others were as silent as cicadas in winter.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Feng! The Lin Family!"</p><p></p><p>Killing intent surged in Wu Yande's eyes. "My Wu Family's deployment in the Cuiwei Market over the past decade has been ruined in an instant! Pass on my order - everyone in the Taubai Academy is to stand down and keep a low profile until this storm passes."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Elder hurriedly cupped his hands in assent.</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Wu Yande continued, "Also, search for Lin Feng secretly. If there is any news of him, inform the clan, and we must take his head!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone agreed in unison.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhou You, who was eavesdropping from within the clan, couldn't help but reveal a slight smile after hearing those outside rumors.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the plan was very successful, I just didn't expect Lin Feng to become the scapegoat for me."</p><p></p><p>All of this was actually his plan. The "White Jade Sword Bone" in the hands of the Taubai Academy was a rumor he had spread by disguising himself in one of the clans and bribing a child to spread it.</p><p></p><p>The Righteous Alliance did indeed receive the information.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps it was a spy the Righteous Alliance had planted in the Taubai Academy who told Meng Xun about it.</p><p></p><p>And so those subsequent events occurred.</p><p></p><p>It was also a coincidence that Zhou You had originally planned to leave the White Jade Sword Bone at an inn after the auction and then have someone report the inn to the Taubai Academy for violating regulations.</p><p></p><p>That way, the people from the Taubai Academy could naturally obtain the White Jade Sword Bone.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, that "Fang Shixiong" showed up halfway, so Zhou You naturally used this more secure method instead.</p><p></p><p>The effect was indeed excellent.</p><p></p><p>This move could be said to kill two birds with one stone - it shifted the focus away from the Huang Li incident and also used the Taubai Academy's hand to severely punish the Righteous Alliance.</p><p></p><p>It even helped the Taubai Academy weed out a Condensed Pellet traitor within their ranks.</p><p></p><p>The Righteous Alliance suffered heavy losses.</p><p></p><p>As for that token with the word "Qi", since the Righteous Alliance was not looking for this item, Zhou You naturally had no need to discard it. It might still be useful in the future.</p><p></p><p>It seems no one has read this, no recommendation tickets, monthly tickets or rewards, feeling a bit discouraged.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

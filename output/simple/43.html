        <h1>Chapter 43</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, Zhou You's cultivation had already reached the fifth level of Qi Refining. The items in his hands also urgently needed to be transformed into his own resources. </p><p></p><p>The plan in his heart could also begin to be executed.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, the Qingying Sword had been polished and completed, its grade upgraded to the top-grade magic weapon level. As for the other mid-grade magic weapon level flying sword, it would also be promoted within these few days.</p><p></p><p>The Qingying Sword was a wood-attributed flying sword. If Zhou You used it, he could get a certain bonus. According to his attempts during this period, it could probably increase its power by about twenty percent, whether it was flying speed or other aspects.</p><p></p><p>As for the other flying sword without an attribute, its price might not fluctuate much, but it was easy to sell.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there was also a Yellow Light Sword, a mid-grade magic weapon level, which could sell for more than three hundred spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You took advantage of the few days when he was polishing the non-attributed flying sword to the top-grade magic weapon level to also perfect the newly purchased martial arts manual "Eight Extremes Destruction" and others.</p><p></p><p>A total of four martial arts were perfected together, and his Body Refining realm barely broke through to the fifth level of Tempering Body.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the power of his flesh, Zhou You was delighted, but also understood that the martial arts of the mortal world were no longer of much benefit to him now.</p><p></p><p>At most, martial arts could only provide a bonus up to the fifth level of Tempering Body. Practicing further would probably not be very useful, with a low cost-effectiveness.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that in the future, I need to collect Body Refining techniques. Fortunately, I don't need medicinal materials for Body Refining, I only need to have techniques to make progress. Otherwise, Body Refining would not be so easy."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You muttered to himself, determined to go to the market town this time to get a Body Refining technique.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, seven days passed, and the non-attributed flying sword finally succeeded in being promoted to the top-grade magic weapon level.</p><p></p><p>At this time, it had been two months since Zhou You killed those two plump and thin cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You did not plan to delay any further. He left the jade pendant given by Xiao Yueying in the wooden house, brought the talisman of the Little Shocking Formation, and after disguising himself, he first went to the nearest inner sect.</p><p></p><p>The main reason for coming to the inner sect was to inquire about the recent news and the direction of the market town.</p><p></p><p>This was Zhou You's first time going to the market town.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had been to this inner sect many times before and was very familiar with it. He sat down at a restaurant nearby, then spent a few dozen spirit sands to order some wine and dishes.</p><p></p><p>This was a frequent hangout for disciples of the Taibai Academy, and there were also many visiting cultivators here to eat and drink. After all, the outskirts of the Taibai Academy were not closed off, and many business cultivators would come and go between the various inner sects and market towns.</p><p></p><p>Although cultivators at the seventh level of Qi Refining and above could abstain from food and drink, most people had not severed their desire for food and drink, so there were still many people in the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>After Zhou You sat down and ate half of his food, he still could not obtain any useful information from the conversations of those cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The only useful information was that there had been more demonic beasts appearing near Luoshui Pass near the Ten Thousand Mountains recently, causing heavy losses for the cultivators who went to the Ten Thousand Mountains to hunt demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>For a time, many cultivators did not dare to enter the Ten Thousand Mountains again, and some even said that a beast tide was coming, which would endanger the entire Lincheng area.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, a few Qi Refining disciples from the Taibai Academy came in.</p><p></p><p>The highest cultivation level among these few disciples was the seventh level of Qi Refining, while the rest were at the fifth and sixth levels.</p><p></p><p>They sat down unconcernedly at the largest table.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, these days are getting harder and harder. Patrolling all day long, I don't even have time for cultivation."</p><p></p><p>A young man with a horse-faced appearance picked at the large fleshy mole on his nose, sounding very displeased as he said, "It's all because of those damned commoners. If it weren't for them, why would I be assigned to patrol every day? I really don't understand why the Academy cares so much about their life and death."</p><p></p><p>The horse-faced youth at the sixth level of Qi Refining was full of displeasure and disdain for those commoners in his tone.</p><p></p><p>A youth at the fifth level of Qi Refining looked around and said, "Martial Brother Ma, you can't say that carelessly. We still..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Let's talk about setting up a formation layer first."</p><p></p><p>The young man with a horse-like face disdainfully said, "What's there to be afraid of those lowly fish servants? No need to set up a formation, would those fish servants dare to come looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>The youth at the fifth level of qi cultivation glanced at the one at the seventh level who seemed to be the leader. Seeing that the seventh level cultivator didn't speak, he could only keep quiet.</p><p></p><p>The youth at the seventh level of qi cultivation was clearly of the highest status. This person had an elegant demeanor and extraordinary bearing. He was born with a pair of phoenix-like eyes and moved with great grace.</p><p></p><p>He gently put down his tea cup and said, "No need to discuss this matter further. Whatever the academy asks us to do, we'll just do it."</p><p></p><p>After he said this, the horse-faced youth indeed dared not say more.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You, witnessing this scene, couldn't help but stroke his chin.</p><p></p><p>Was Taibai Academy doing this for the sake of them, these "fish servants"?</p><p></p><p>What a joke.</p><p></p><p>The bigger reason was probably to find Huang Li and obtain clues about him.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You didn't speak, only continuing to eat his meal silently.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the eyes of the fifth level cultivator shifted as he changed the topic, "Senior Brother Fang, I heard that recently Junior Sister Bai Chi broke through again? She is truly an rarely-seen genius of our Taibai Academy."</p><p></p><p>Upon mentioning Bai Chi, the elegant Senior Brother Fang's eyes lit up slightly, clearly becoming interested.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Fang smiled, "Yes, Junior Sister Bai's cultivation speed is indeed admirable."</p><p></p><p>At Taibai Academy, seniority was determined by entry time.</p><p></p><p>Bai Chi had entered the academy relatively recently, and was also young in age, so most people addressed her as "Junior Sister."</p><p></p><p>The horse-faced youth said, "It's quite strange actually. I had heard before that when Junior Sister Bai practiced fishing spirit fish for two to three months, she couldn't catch a single one. But later during the year-end competition, she actually got first place in the fishing event, even better than Lin Feng."</p><p></p><p>The other Taibai disciples also discussed it endlessly, expressing admiration.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Fang smiled, "Perhaps that was just a smokescreen from Junior Sister Bai before. Her skills are still quite formidable."</p><p></p><p>At this point, someone said, "But I've heard that Bai Chi can only fish for first-rank low-grade spirit fish, and can't catch any other grades at all."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zhou You, listening to the conversations between those Taibai disciples nearby, learned about Bai Chi's identity as a genius disciple of the academy. No wonder she dared to steal the Ancient Heaven's Formation.</p><p></p><p>After an incense stick's worth of time passed with no more useful information, he paid and left.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had previously asked the server about the location of the nearest market town.</p><p></p><p>So his goal was very clear - after entering a forest, he would change his appearance again, then head to that market town.</p><p></p><p>Through testing, as long as the other party couldn't see through Zhou You's cultivation level after he changed his appearance, they wouldn't be able to detect his disguise technique, allowing it to complement his concealment technique.</p><p></p><p>The market town was called Cuiwei Market, over 600 li northwest of the inner sect.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You traveled with qing feng du, an extremely fast movement technique, so the over 600 li only took a little over two hours.</p><p></p><p>Cuiwei Market was located in a valley, surrounded by a layer of mist - a very simple formation meant to keep out beasts and ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>But to a qi cultivation practitioner, even at the first level, it was practically useless.</p><p></p><p>When Zhou You saw the mist, he exhaled, having finally arrived at the market town.</p><p></p><p>He didn't hesitate, first restraining his cultivation to appear at the third level of qi cultivation, then walked into the mist. Passing through layer after layer, a small town appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

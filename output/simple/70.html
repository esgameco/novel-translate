        <h1>Chapter 70</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In the underground secret room of Taibai Lane in Xiaoshan Town Market.</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan frowned as he looked at the black-robed cultivator in front of him. </p><p></p><p>"What happened to you? I told you to be extremely careful and not let your guard down, but you still ran into trouble at the Luoshui Pass?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan's expression was gloomy, showing some displeasure.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator's shoulder was a bloody mess, and his breath was somewhat weak, clearly having suffered a severe injury.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator said anxiously, "Young Master, this has little to do with me. It was mainly because the Condensing Pellet cultivators like Meng Xun were too arrogant and did not take the guards at Luoshui Pass seriously. They did not expect to be injured by the sword aura left behind by the Taibai Sword Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan gave a cold snort, his expression darkening, "I told my father long ago that the Righteous Sect Alliance is useless!"</p><p></p><p>This Mu Jihan was the son of the Marquis of Lin'an, yet he referred to the Marquis as "father emperor" - a title used only for emperors!</p><p></p><p>This showed how audacious Mu Jihan was.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator asked, "Young Master, what about Xiao Yueyingr?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan coldly snorted, "Our mission in coming to the Taibai Academy this time is to control Xiao Yueying, so that the Xiao Family of Nanzhou can serve my Lin'an Mansion! Now Xiao Yueying's abode is protected by formations, and she has reached the middle stage of Foundation Establishment. For us to capture Xiao Yueying alive is almost impossible. Our only hope lies with Zhou You."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator cupped his fist and said, "Rest assured, Young Master. I will go and bring Zhou You here. If he does not obey, I will use the Soul Devouring technique to possess his body, and he will naturally be under our control."</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan tossed a bottle of pellets to the black-robed cultivator and said indifferently, "You have already wasted over a month's time. You have three days to suppress your injuries, then come with me to subdue Zhou You."</p><p></p><p>"Three days... Young Master, why not go now? Although I am injured, subduing a mere Qi Refining cultivator should be easy, no?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan's tone was icy cold, "I said, Xiao Yueying values him greatly. If we give him the formation and life-protecting talisman, as long as we alert Xiao Yueying, our plan will be ruined."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Young Master!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator's body trembled, and he quickly cupped his fist in agreement.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was wholeheartedly refining the Yin Spirit Puppet.</p><p></p><p>However, in the end, he still underestimated the difficulty of refining the Yin Spirit Puppet.</p><p></p><p>Although he had learned the Qingmu Puppetry Technique, perhaps because he had not fully mastered it, the success rate of refining the Yin Spirit Puppet was still somewhat pitiful.</p><p></p><p>With five sets of materials, only one succeeded, and even then, the Yin Spirit Puppet's cultivation level was only at the seventh layer of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>It could barely be considered a top-grade first-rank puppet.</p><p></p><p>However, to unleash the full power of the Five Ghosts Suppressing Formation, the Yin Spirit Puppet needed to reach the ninth layer of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>So after comprehensive consideration, Zhou You gave up refining it for now and decided to refine the Yin Spirit Puppet after fully mastering the Qingmu Puppetry Technique.</p><p></p><p>This way, he would also avoid wasting more materials.</p><p></p><p>The time was too rushed, and he was too anxious.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Qingmu Puppetry Technique was a first-rank top-grade inheritance, and the practice time was too short, so the progress was not enough.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After giving up refining the Yin Spirit Puppet, Zhou You began refining other simple puppets using simple materials to improve his progress in the Qingmu Puppetry Technique.</p><p></p><p>Apart from this, other matters were also proceeding in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>At night, after Zhou You finished practicing the Qingyuan Body Technique, he was about to stop and draw talismans when his brows suddenly furrowed, and his expression became somewhat gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"Mu Jihan actually found his way here? And his cultivation level... the initial stage of Foundation Establishment?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's spiritual sense was now stronger than an ordinary early Foundation Establishment cultivator, so he could detect anyone entering within a five-mile radius.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Zhou You also had the Minor Shocking Spirit Formation and the Minor Five Elements Formation.</p><p></p><p>The coverage range of these two formations also reached nearly five miles.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>To the extent that Cheng Du was able to sense the cultivation levels of others.</p><p></p><p>So, as soon as Mu Jihan and that black-robed cultivator appeared, Zhou You already knew about it.  </p><p></p><p>However, what Zhou You did not expect was that Mu Jihan was actually a Foundation Establishment cultivator!</p><p></p><p>He suppressed his cultivation to the second level of Qi Condensation, hiding in Taibai Academy. What did he want to do?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the person beside him...</p><p></p><p>Wearing a mask, Zhou You discovered that the mask had the ability to block spiritual sense, so Zhou You could not see who he really was for the time being.</p><p></p><p>But his Foundation Establishment cultivation could not be concealed.</p><p></p><p>"Two Foundation Establishment cultivators, it seems Mu Jihan has come with ill intentions."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You thought to himself, inevitably recalling Wang Tiezhu's plea for help. Could it really be related to Mu Jihan?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You would not naively think that Mu Jihan had come to chat with him. He immediately and silently activated the Minor Shocking Spirit Formation, while the Minor Five Phases Formation was also poised to strike.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Mu Jihan and the black-robed cultivator landed in the woods not far away.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator said, "Young Master, please wait here for a moment. I will go and capture Zhou You right away."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he was about to head towards the wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>For him, it would be easy to capture an ordinary Qi Condensation cultivator like Zhou You. He did not need to worry at all.</p><p></p><p>However, Mu Jihan frowned and said in a low voice, "Something's not right, Zhou You is not in the wooden hut."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator was stunned and asked doubtfully, "Could it be that we came at the wrong time?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he scanned the wooden hut with his spiritual sense and indeed found it empty, with no trace of Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan's brow furrowed, and just as he was about to speak, the wooden hut suddenly exploded violently. The hut was instantly shattered, and then a figure burst out from inside and landed on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, if you had obediently listened to me, I might have given you an opportunity."</p><p></p><p>It turned out to be a young man with an unusual appearance.</p><p></p><p>The young man had narrow eyes, thin lips, a jade-like white complexion, and a somewhat scholarly air.</p><p></p><p>In his hand, he held a youth around twenty years old, dressed in a coarse linen robe, with a pale face full of terror, unable to move!</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this the Zhou You that Mu Jihan and the black-robed cultivator were looking for?</p><p></p><p>"Meng Xun!"</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing the unusual-looking young man, Mu Jihan and the black-robed cultivator's expressions changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>They never expected that Meng Xun would beat them to it!</p><p></p><p>Neither Mu Jihan nor the black-robed cultivator wanted to face Meng Xun.</p><p></p><p>Although this person followed orders from the Lin'an Prefecture, he acted recklessly and did whatever he pleased, not showing much respect for Mu Jihan, the young marquis.</p><p></p><p>"Well, well, if it isn't the young marquis. What, are you two also interested in this little fish?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Xun had clearly noticed Mu Jihan and the black-robed cultivator, and he revealed a somewhat mocking smile.</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan did not speak, only staring at Meng Xun with a puzzled gaze.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator, however, angrily said, "Meng Xun, don't think you can do as you please just because you've done some things for the Lin'an Prefecture. When you see the young marquis, you should kneel down!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Xun snorted coldly, "What kind of human or demonic creature is that? Show your face before speaking to me."</p><p></p><p>"You...!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator's expression changed, seeming to dread Meng Xun. In the end, he still removed his own mask.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Zhou You, who was hiding in the shadows, clearly saw the black-robed cultivator's face.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually him!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>I always struggle to keep up with reading, so I hope all patrons can try to read a little every day and not let the book accumulate. By the way, please leave a free recommendation vote if you can. Thank you.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

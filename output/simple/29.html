        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Are you serious?</p><p></p><p>An ancient formation compendium that specifically collects ancient formation methods? </p><p></p><p>I just asked you to help me find an ordinary formation, and you brought me a complete collection of ancient formations?</p><p></p><p>Am I, a mere cultivator at the third level of Qi refinement, qualified to read things from the ancient times?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked at the book, speechless.</p><p></p><p>"That...Miss Bai, where did you get this book from?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You asked.</p><p></p><p>Bai Chi Yu said, "I stole it from the library of the Taibai Academy. After I returned yesterday, I browsed the library but couldn't find the formation you wanted, so I found this book instead."</p><p></p><p>The young lady spoke lightly, as if talking about something trivial.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Stolen from the Taibai Academy.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's mouth twitched, wondering if the Taibai Academy would regard him as a book thief after finding out.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong? Is this book not suitable?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Chi Yu clutched the folds at her waist, looking at Zhou You with slight nervousness.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You shook his head, "No, it's great. Thank you, Miss."</p><p></p><p>Bai Chi Yu hurriedly waved her hand and pointed at the book, saying, "That...you can only read it for two days. I need to return it after two days, or it will be discovered."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You smiled and nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Bai Chi Yu did not linger, turning to her fishing spot and continuing to fish.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had originally planned to teach Bai Chi Yu fishing now, but considering he only had two days, he decided to seize the time to study this ancient formation book.</p><p></p><p>So Zhou You went back inside and began examining this ancient formation book.</p><p></p><p>Since time was limited, Zhou You spent almost the entire two days immersed in this book, except for the two hours of cultivation in the morning.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there wasn't much he could read in the entire book because it had a restriction placed on it - the stronger one's spiritual sense, the more content could be seen.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's spiritual sense was only at the sixth level of Qi refinement, so he could only see two formations.</p><p></p><p>One was the Minor Shocking Spirit Formation, and the other was the Minor Five Elements Formation.</p><p></p><p>These two formations could be deployed during the Qi refinement stage and used all the way until the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>The Minor Shocking Spirit Formation was an illusion formation whose purpose was to affect a cultivator's spiritual sense and mind. It was easy to construct, and a single formation was not very powerful, only able to trap cultivators at the fifth or sixth level of Qi refinement.</p><p></p><p>However, it had a unique feature - multiple formations could be stacked together. Theoretically, with enough stacking, it could grow infinitely powerful, even affecting Foundation Establishment cultivators. If the formation controller's spiritual sense was stronger than the opponent's, it could even attack the opponent's spiritual sense!</p><p></p><p>As for the Minor Five Elements Formation, it was an offensive-defensive formation that required the creation of five formation flags.</p><p></p><p>This formation did not require the controller to have strong cultivation - even someone at the first level of Qi refinement could control it.</p><p></p><p>However, its power depended entirely on the quality of the formation flags created. The stronger the flags, the more powerful the formation. If the flags were strong enough, it could even trap early Foundation Establishment cultivators!</p><p></p><p>Both of these ancient formations were exquisite, and they shared one characteristic: when inactive, they were very difficult to detect.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Minor Five Elements Formation is powerful, creating the formation flags requires some attainment in refining artifacts, which I have not learned yet. It would likely be difficult for me to create qualified Five Elements flags."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You pondered silently, "The Minor Shocking Spirit Formation is relatively simpler - I only need to find materials and carve the formation patterns onto them. And as long as I have enough materials, it can grow infinitely, which combined with my spiritual sense, should be able to produce unexpected effects."</p><p></p><p>Without much thought, Zhou You chose the Minor Shocking Spirit Formation as his means of empowerment.</p><p></p><p>He repeatedly studied the two formations, etching them firmly into his mind.</p><p></p><p>On the third day, Zhou You returned the Ancient Formation Compendium to Bai Chi Yu.</p><p></p><p>Bai Chi Yu asked, "Do you want to read it for two more days?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You shook his head, "No need."</p><p></p><p>"Oh."</p><p></p><p>Bai Chi Yu nodded, took the Ancient Formation Compendium, and left on her sword.</p><p></p><p>After these few interactions, Bai Chi Yu was clearly not as reserved anymore.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Bai Chi Yu returned and resumed fishing, evidently having returned the Ancient Formation Compendium.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Watching Bai Chi Yu fishing so seriously, Zhou You walked over and said, "You're fishing incorrectly. Each type of fish has different living habits, especially spirit fish. The low-grade spirit fish I catch prefer to live about three zhang (around 10 meters) under the water." </p><p></p><p>"When you set up the fishing ground, you must choose bait that can sink three zhang deep. If it's too light, it won't go down, but if it's too heavy, it will sink to the bottom."</p><p></p><p>"After setting up the fishing ground, you need to adjust the float and line."</p><p></p><p>The delicate girl's ears turned pink. She said "Oh" and then asked, "What is...setting up the fishing ground?"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You fell silent, then patiently began to explain.</p><p></p><p>Half a shi'chen (two hours) later.</p><p></p><p>Under Zhou You's guidance, Bai Chi Yu finally caught her first spirit fish in life.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful! I finally caught a spirit fish!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you!"</p><p></p><p>Bai Chi Yu looked at the spirit fish, overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You said, "You helped me too."</p><p></p><p>Then Bai Chi Yu said goodbye to Zhou You and transformed into a white rainbow, leaving.</p><p></p><p>Watching Bai Chi Yu leave, Zhou You returned to the wooden hut and changed into a Daoist robe. There was a crackling sound from his body, and his face transformed into that of a young man with a square face. His whole body also became much taller.</p><p></p><p>It turned out Zhou You was using a body-shrinking technique for disguise.</p><p></p><p>"This jade pendant...I should leave it at home."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You took out the jade pendant given to him by Xiao Yue Ying.</p><p></p><p>With this jade pendant, he could go listen to the public lecture at Taibai Academy.</p><p></p><p>The public lecture was only going to happen in the next few days. Originally, Zhou You planned to attend, but now that he knew the Zhengqi Alliance might find him at any time, he had no mind to listen to any public lectures.</p><p></p><p>The urgent task now was to liquidate all his resources into means to increase his own strength.</p><p></p><p>He had to set up the Xiao Jing Shen Formation.</p><p></p><p>So Zhou You had to hurry to the major spirit markets and sell the spirit fish he had, then purchase materials for the Xiao Jing Shen Formation.</p><p></p><p>As for this jade pendant, Zhou You had read in a travel journal that powerful cultivators could leave markings on certain objects to track or monitor them.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was afraid Xiao Yue Ying had left a marking on this jade pendant. If he carried it, Xiao could track his movements.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Zhou You chose to leave the jade pendant in the wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>As for the Zhou family spirit imprint on his body, that object had no tracking effect, only an alerting effect. As long as cultivators used their spiritual sense to scan him, they would know he had the Xiao family's spirit imprint and his identity.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You had a mind-concealing technique. Unless someone could see through his cultivation level, they wouldn't be able to see his spirit imprint.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>In an inn in a town near Lincheng's Taibai Academy.</p><p></p><p>Two cultivators, one fat and one thin, set up a restrictive spell in their room before starting to discuss.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li, why did the elders send just the two of us, who have only reached the fifth level of Qi Condensation, to Taibai Academy? Isn't that going too far? If we're discovered, we'll be in trouble!"</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator, who looked around thirty-four or thirty-five years old, white and plump, picked his nose and said with some helplessness.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator surnamed Li was less than half the size of the fat one, but much older, at least in his forties.</p><p></p><p>He said, "The higher the cultivation level, the easier it is to be discovered entering Taibai Academy. This is also a good opportunity for us to make contributions. As long as we find those fish servants, we may get information about Huang Li from them. Then we can advance by leaps and bounds!"</p><p></p><p>Pausing, he continued, "Although you're a talisman master, do you really think you can reach the Foundation Establishment stage relying on those minor skills?"</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator sighed, "Alright, when shall we set out?"</p><p></p><p>The cultivator surnamed Li thought for a moment and said, "Taibai Academy must be highly vigilant now with tight security inside. It would be very dangerous for us to go in. But three months later is their annual grand competition, when they'll let their guard down. We'll go in then and definitely gain something!"</p>

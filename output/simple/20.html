        <h1>Chapter 20</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"A cultivator with spiritual roots who has just started practicing cultivation is worth only two spirit stones, alas." </p><p></p><p>Zhou You couldn't help but shake his head, lamenting how little a human life is worth.</p><p></p><p>After going through the entire account book, he was secretly shocked in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Over the past three to four years, Huang Li had lured more than thirty people to the Zhengqi Alliance. The fates of these people were either dying in the mines or having their hearts dug out and livers taken by evil cultivators, after which their bodies were refined into corpse puppets. </p><p></p><p>How miserable.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Zhou You had been cautious at the time and did not follow Huang Li to the Zhengqi Alliance. Otherwise, he would have met the same fate as these people.</p><p></p><p>That would have truly been a case of his endeavor crumbling halfway through before he could succeed.</p><p></p><p>"Phewâ€”"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You exhaled, silently reminding himself to be cautious when walking the path of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He then put away the account book and picked up another book.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually the middle and latter sections of the Vein Opening Manual!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the contents written in the book, Zhou You couldn't help but show a delighted expression!</p><p></p><p>He had just recently stepped into the third level of Qi Cultivation and was worried about not having the middle section of the Vein Opening Manual. He never expected Huang Li to deliver it to him!</p><p></p><p>He even kindly gifted the latter section as well!</p><p></p><p>Now he had cultivation methods all the way up to the ninth level of Qi Cultivation!</p><p></p><p>This would save him dozens of spirit stones and spare him from having to show his face in the market.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You glanced through it briefly before respectfully putting away the Vein Opening Manual.</p><p></p><p>The last book was a travelogue in the cultivation world, roughly describing the experiences and observations of a Pill Formation cultivator in the Great Qi region.</p><p></p><p>This piqued Zhou You's interest.</p><p></p><p>However, he only skimmed through it before putting it away, planning to read it slowly later.</p><p></p><p>All that was left was a jade slip and a sheepskin scroll.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You picked up the jade slip first and scanned it with his spiritual sense, immediately seeing its contents.</p><p></p><p>"The Soul Condensing Art?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's mind sank as he carefully read the contents of this "Soul Condensing Art."</p><p></p><p>After the time it took to burn an incense stick, Zhou You's brows raised in delight!</p><p></p><p>This was actually a secret technique specifically used to condense one's spiritual sense and conceal one's cultivation level!</p><p></p><p>According to the description, this "Soul Condensing Art" was quite effective. The stronger one's spiritual sense, the better the concealment effect. With the spiritual sense of the third level of Qi Cultivation, one could deceive the spiritual sense probing of a cultivator at the ninth level of Qi Cultivation!</p><p></p><p>With the spiritual sense of the fourth level of Qi Cultivation, one could conceal from the spiritual sense probing of an early Foundation Establishment cultivator!</p><p></p><p>"Ah yes! Huang Li was able to hide among the masses of workers for years with just the third level of Qi Cultivation. He must have had a way to conceal his cultivation level, and it seems this Soul Condensing Art was the method!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You pondered for a moment before saying, "Although my cultivation level is only the third level of Qi Cultivation, my spiritual sense is comparable to the fourth level. By employing the Soul Condensing Art, even early Foundation Establishment cultivators won't be able to see through my cultivation level!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You put away the jade slip, his mood greatly improved.</p><p></p><p>For a long time, what Zhou You had worried about the most was his cultivation level being exposed.</p><p></p><p>From Huang Li's departure and return, risking his life just to come back and assassinate him, one could see how dangerous it was for one's cultivation level to be exposed.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had the aid of the Golden Imprint, allowing his cultivation speed to be fast, but this cultivation level was like a timed bomb that could explode at any moment.</p><p></p><p>But now with the Soul Condensing Art, it perfectly resolved Zhou You's crisis.</p><p></p><p>With the Soul Condensing Art and Zhou You using the Golden Imprint to enhance his spiritual power and strengthen his spiritual sense, the concealment effect could reach the pinnacle.</p><p></p><p>What did Zhou You have to fear now?</p><p></p><p>Huang Li was simply his own benefactor!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You picked up the last sheepskin scroll and opened it to find a token wrapped inside. The token had the word "Qi" written on it, while the sheepskin scroll itself contained a map.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You examined the token. It was a purple-gold color, neither metal nor jade, made of some unknown material, with mysterious patterns carved on it.</p><p></p><p>Unable to make sense of it, Zhou You put the token away and turned his attention to deciphering the map.</p><p></p><p>After studying it for a while, Zhou You finally understood what it was!</p><p></p><p>This map was the location of the Zhengqi Alliance's Grand Lord's hidden treasure that Huang Li had mentioned before!</p><p></p><p>It was said that the Zhengqi Alliance's Grand Lord was one of the few Pill Formation cultivators in Lincheng.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Treasure Trove of a Pill Cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou's breathing became rapid, even he felt his heart pounding!</p><p></p><p>He never expected the rumors to be true!</p><p></p><p>Previously when Zhouyou was at the Fish Servant Hut, he had heard that Huangli was being hunted down, largely because he possessed clues to the treasure trove of the Sect Master of the Righteous Qi Sect. </p><p></p><p>It's clear how many people coveted this Pill Cultivator's treasure trove!</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou looked at the sheepskin scroll, his eyes burning with desire.</p><p></p><p>But soon, he suppressed the greed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>With his current cultivation, trying to obtain the Pill Condensation treasure would be seeking death!</p><p></p><p>At the very least, he would need to reach the Foundation Establishment realm before he could even consider it.</p><p></p><p>"This item...cannot let anyone know about it, or my life will be in danger!"</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou put away the sheepskin scroll, clearly understanding the risks involved.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was grateful for his previous caution in handling Huangli's death.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if it was exposed that Huangli died by his hand, Zhouyou would be in deep trouble.</p><p></p><p>However, it was puzzling how Huangli, a mere Qi Condensation cultivator, obtained clues to a Pill Cultivator's treasure trove. There must be some hidden secret.</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou didn't dwell on it further. He took a deep breath, hid the small bag close to his body, then took out the middle volume of the Meridian Opening Manual and began cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou had already completed the first volume of the Meridian Opening Manual, so cultivating the middle volume came naturally.</p><p></p><p>After two hours passed, Zhouyou clearly felt the spiritual power within him increasing, but the golden imprint showed no reaction or words appearing.</p><p></p><p>"It seems cultivation after the third level of Qi Condensation is much harder than before, improving is not an overnight matter."</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou sensed the gradually calming spiritual power within and understood.</p><p></p><p>The time he had the cultivation boost was still only two hours.</p><p></p><p>But since the spiritual power capacity of the third level of Qi Condensation far exceeded the second level, the middle volume of the Meridian Opening Manual didn't make any progress in a day.</p><p></p><p>Hence, the golden imprint remained inactive.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he would need to cultivate continuously for several days.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the slow progress of the Meridian Opening Manual, Zhouyou instead began cultivating a spell contained in the middle volume - the Fire Talisman Art!</p><p></p><p>This was the fire spell Huangli used against Zhouyou.</p><p></p><p>Any spiritual root could cultivate such a basic spell.</p><p></p><p>It was just that those with a fire spiritual root would have a somewhat greater power when cultivating the Fire Talisman Art.</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou circulated his spiritual power according to the cultivation requirements of the Fire Talisman Art.</p><p></p><p>"Release!"</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou raised his hand, and a thumb-sized flame appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Fire Talisman Art in his hand, Zhouyou wasn't disappointed at all. In fact, he was a little excited since this was the first spell he had cast.</p><p></p><p>[Fire Talisman Art (1/100): A basic spell, cast it a hundred times a day, and it can be mastered in ten days!]</p><p></p><p>Soon, the golden imprint flickered and information about the Fire Talisman Art appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Cast it a hundred times a day? That's a bit exaggerated!"</p><p></p><p>After seeing the information, Zhouyou couldn't help but feel a little resigned.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't dwell on it too much since he had plenty of time.</p><p></p><p>So he began casting the Fire Talisman Art inside the wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>The wooden hut would light up for a moment, then the flames would extinguish.</p><p></p><p>This continued for thirty times before Zhouyou stopped.</p><p></p><p>Not because he didn't want to practice anymore, but because he had depleted all his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>He could only recover his spiritual power before continuing to practice.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, after thirty rounds of practice, the size of the flames had expanded from thumb-sized to the size of a large thumb.</p><p></p><p>There was some progress at least.</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou didn't get discouraged. He sat cross-legged and circulated the Meridian Opening Manual to recover his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou knew that as long as he persevered, he would definitely be able to master the Fire Talisman Art.</p><p></p><p>Seeking more readers, new book seeking readers takes precedence over all else... Also, I hope everyone can invest a little, the investment in this book is too little...</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>However, growing medicinal herbs was a bit less effective. </p><p></p><p>For example, when Zhou You grew cabbages, he could shorten the growth cycle by one-sixth, but when growing ginseng, he could only shorten it by one-tenth.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if it's really the effect of 'growing vegetables'," Zhou You thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Zhou You fetched a bucket of water from Erhai Lake and watered the medicinal herbs with it. </p><p></p><p>As he was about to finish working, he suddenly noticed that the golden seal in his consciousness was flickering.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a line of words appeared on the golden seal.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation (1/100): An extremely profound study, requiring the daily infusion of spiritual power into spiritual objects. Progress can be made over time."</p><p></p><p>With the appearance of these words, Zhou You couldn't help but feel a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>The golden seal had actually recorded the "Cultivation" skill?</p><p></p><p>Although "Cultivation" didn't have much introduction, it was known to be a "profound" level skill, just like "Polishing" and "Chopping".</p><p></p><p>It was most likely an upgrade from "Growing Vegetables".</p><p></p><p>Why hadn't "Cultivation" been recorded before when he had been watering the medicinal herbs for so long, but it was suddenly recorded now?</p><p></p><p>This made Zhou You puzzled, and he began to observe those medicinal herbs.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he understood the reason!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's spiritual sense was extremely powerful, and his strong spiritual power also made his six senses keen. After using his spiritual sense, he easily noticed the changes in those medicinal herbs.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the medicinal herbs had grown to this stage, possibly because the water from Erhai Lake contained spiritual power, or because there was abundant spiritual energy within Taibai Academy, causing these medicinal herbs to already contain a trace of the spiritual power of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>This spiritual power of Heaven and Earth was not strong, to the point where it could not even be absorbed.</p><p></p><p>But it was still a trace of spiritual power nonetheless.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was for this very reason that the golden seal recorded the "Cultivation" skill.</p><p></p><p>After figuring this out, Zhou You felt quite satisfied.</p><p></p><p>After all, "Cultivation" was also a "profound" level skill. Perhaps its effect on shortening the growth cycle of medicinal herbs would be even more significant than "Growing Vegetables". If so, Zhou You could use this skill to enter the profession of a pill refiner in the future.</p><p></p><p>Just think about it - if the medicinal herbs he cultivated had a shorter growth period than others, a spiritual herb that would normally take a hundred years to mature could instead take only fifty years, or even twenty years or ten years. This would greatly reduce the cost of pill refining.</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation world, time was the most precious thing.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You exhaled, very satisfied with having recorded the "Cultivation" skill this time.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>For cultivators, time often passed quickly. Zhou You had only been cultivating for half a year, yet he already felt that time had flown by extremely fast.</p><p></p><p>Looking up, it was already autumn, making him feel that the years were passing too swiftly.</p><p></p><p>The deep autumn wind was cold, and there were fallen leaves everywhere. Zhou You, wearing thin clothes, was polishing his sword by the lake, occasionally looking up to see cultivators from Taibai Academy rushing past in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Twenty-eight days had passed since his physical body had last broken through to the fourth level of Body Tempering.</p><p></p><p>Recently, cultivators from Taibai Academy had been rushing past in the sky every day, as if they were busy with some important matter.</p><p></p><p>When Zhou You asked at the Fisherman's Hut, he learned that Taibai Academy's annual year-end competition would begin in just over ten days.</p><p></p><p>This was the most important event of the year for Taibai Academy.</p><p></p><p>Every disciple would display their skills in the great competition, vying for a good ranking.</p><p></p><p>Those who achieved a good ranking could obtain more cultivation resources and privileges from the academy in the coming year.</p><p></p><p>Even Xiao Yueying placed great importance on this year-end competition and didn't pay as much attention to Zhou You as before, which actually made Zhou You feel quite relieved.</p><p></p><p>The more Xiao Yueying cared about him, the more uncomfortable Zhou You felt.</p><p></p><p>Especially after the incident where Xiao Qing proposed living together with him.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This made Zhou You feel increasingly uneasy. Therefore, he was relatively more guarded against Xiao Yueying.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know when I'll be able to fly on a sword."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You muttered to himself, focusing his attention on the yellow light sword in his hand. </p><p></p><p>After another half hour, Zhou You noticed the flickering of the golden seal in his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>[Grinding (100/100): A relatively profound study, grinding every day, a firm iron can become a needle, persisting will eventually bear fruit!]</p><p></p><p>[Grinding perfected, gained trait: Keen Edge!]</p><p></p><p>[Keen Edge: Can enhance the sharpness and quality of blades through "grinding."]</p><p></p><p>This time, in addition to an unprecedented golden glow, the golden seal also displayed three lines of text!</p><p></p><p>Seeing these three lines of text, Zhou You's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>[Grinding] was Zhou You's first profound-level skill, and now it had finally reached perfection, and he even gained his first trait!</p><p></p><p>Trait was a word that had appeared in the golden seal before when Zhou You was learning the "Minor Shocking Formation."</p><p></p><p>At that time, Zhou You had guessed that this trait might be similar to his ability to reduce the growth cycle of the herbs he planted.</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed that it was indeed quite similar. </p><p></p><p>In any case, it meant that when using certain skills, he could gain some special enhancements.</p><p></p><p>"Enhance sharpness and quality, I don't know what quality refers to? Could it mean enhancing the level of magic treasures?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You thought to himself. He took the yellow light sword in his hand and scanned it with his spiritual sense. The yellow light sword did not seem to have undergone any major changes, except that it was sharper, there did not seem to be much difference.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's because I haven't gained the trait before. I'll continue grinding for the next few days and see if there are any changes."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You muttered and continued grinding the yellow light sword.</p><p></p><p>Since he had gained the trait, Zhou You naturally wanted to try it out.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the golden seal's radiance flickered, and a large amount of mysterious power surged into Zhou You's body.</p><p></p><p>The enhancements gained after perfecting a "profound" level life skill were quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You clearly felt his physical strength being enhanced again.</p><p></p><p>However, this time there was no significant enhancement.</p><p></p><p>[Grinding] brought more enhancements in terms of spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>When grinding the sword, Zhou You clearly felt his spiritual sense being greatly enhanced in that instant.</p><p></p><p>"Seventy zhang?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was stunned for a moment, somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>He did not expect the enhancement to his spiritual sense from [Grinding] to be so remarkable!</p><p></p><p>It should be known that Zhou You's previous spiritual sense could only cover forty zhang, equivalent to the strength of the sixth level of Cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But now it had directly increased by thirty zhang!</p><p></p><p>Reaching the strength of the seventh level of Cultivation, and only thirty zhang away from the level of the eighth level of Cultivation!</p><p></p><p>The seventh level of Cultivation is a spiritual sense above fifty zhang, while the eighth level is above one hundred zhang!</p><p></p><p>In addition to enhancing his spiritual sense, the strengthening of his spiritual power also sharpened his six senses and made his perception even keener.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it's a profound-level skill, this enhancement is indeed formidable."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You praised endlessly, feeling refreshed, with clear ears and eyes, the whole world appearing renewed before him.</p><p></p><p>This enhancement absolutely surpassed any previous life skill enhancements.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You calmed his mind and continued grinding the yellow light sword. He wanted to see what changes this yellow light sword could undergo under the empowerment of the "Keen Edge" trait!</p><p></p><p>If it could enhance the quality of the yellow light sword, then the value of "Keen Edge" would be beyond imagination!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 74</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The moment that spiritual force appeared, Mu Jihan's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>"Foundation Establishment spiritual force!" </p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan exclaimed in shock, his heart turbulent like raging waves.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was actually a Foundation Establishment cultivator?</p><p></p><p>What was he doing hiding near Xiao Yueying? </p><p></p><p>Or was he sent here by Xiao Yueying?</p><p></p><p>But that made no sense at all!</p><p></p><p>Or could it be that in just over three years, Zhou You started from zero and cultivated all the way to the Foundation Establishment realm?</p><p></p><p>That was absolutely impossible!</p><p></p><p>No one could start from zero and reach Foundation Establishment in just over three years!</p><p></p><p>These thoughts in an instant filled Mu Jihan's heart with an intense chill.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>He felt as if his spiritual ocean was violently struck by the hammer used to ring a bell. In an instant, he was dazed on the spot, his spiritual ocean in chaos, his consciousness blurred, his mind blank.</p><p></p><p>The intense pain, the terrifying spiritual attack, caused blood to flow from his seven orifices.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual attack was unstoppable!</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, without spiritual force and magic power to sustain it, the purple-gold greatsword also fell to the ground with a heavy thud.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>A giant stone hand burst from the earth, grabbing Mu Jihan's body and squeezing fiercely, causing a "crack" sound as who knows how many of Mu Jihan's bones shattered!</p><p></p><p>But it didn't end there - terrifying black spines erupted from Mu Jihan's body, rapidly growing into a cocoon in just a moment!</p><p></p><p>All of Mu Jihan's inner magic power was drained at this moment, completely absorbed by those black spines!</p><p></p><p>"Thump"</p><p></p><p>The black cocoon fell to the ground, Mu Jihan passing out from the pain.</p><p></p><p>And with that, the battle ended.</p><p></p><p>Two Foundation Establishment cultivators were utterly defeated by Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>In fact, they were defeated before even seeing Zhou You!</p><p></p><p>Master Liu's life force was still fading away. He stared blankly at the scene before him, a tinge of regret welling up.</p><p></p><p>"Creak--"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the wooden house's main door finally opened.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You, dressed in a coarse hemp robe, slowly walked out.</p><p></p><p>His face looked a bit pale - he had just forcefully activated the Xiao Jing Spirit Formation's spiritual attack using all his effort against Mu Jihan.</p><p></p><p>Although he injured Mu Jihan's spiritual force, Zhou You himself had also suffered some backlash.</p><p></p><p>Hence his pale face.</p><p></p><p>"Ugh--"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhou You, Master Liu opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but found he had no strength left to speak.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You noticed Master Liu and made a hand seal, causing the ground to rise up and rapidly encase Master Liu in stone, bringing him before Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked at Master Liu and asked softly, "Why were you looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Master Liu realized Zhou You had no idea why they had come for him.</p><p></p><p>It made his face twitch.</p><p></p><p>You don't even know why we came, yet you attacked us so viciously?</p><p></p><p>Are you insane?</p><p></p><p>Master Liu opened his mouth wide, his throat moving, but he couldn't utter a word.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhou You frowned and checked Master Liu's injuries, realizing they were life-threatening - he had reached the end stage.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's current pill refinement skills could only produce first-grade superior pills, none that could heal Master Liu.</p><p></p><p>So he could only watch him die.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Zhou You didn't care about Master Liu's life, he just hadn't gotten the answers he wanted from him yet.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Zhou You had an idea.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You activated the Xiao Jing Spirit Formation and manipulated his spiritual force. First suppressing Master Liu's spiritual force with the formation, then invading his spiritual ocean with his own force to cast a Mind Control technique!</p><p></p><p>This Mind Control technique was learned from the fat cultivator of the Zheng Qi Alliance back then...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>What was obtained inside the storage bag.</p><p></p><p>This kind of devilish magic art would not be sold in ordinary markets, and was prohibited from being bought and sold openly in the Great Qi Imperial Dynasty. </p><p></p><p>When Zhou You originally obtained it, he had never thought there would be a time to use it, but now it came in handy to use on Uncle Liu.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Liu seemed to know what Zhou You wanted to do, immediately widening his eyes, his throat trembling, wanting to make a sound, but at this final moment, his whole body shuddered, his gaze became somewhat dazed, and his entire being became sluggish.</p><p></p><p>"Success!"</p><p></p><p>A trace of delight appeared in Zhou You's eyes.  </p><p></p><p>He didn't expect to succeed on the first try, which was also due to the suppression of the spirit formation's spiritual sense, as well as his spiritual sense being stronger than ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators. Otherwise, trying to perform soul control technique on a Foundation Establishment cultivator would likely not be so easy to succeed.</p><p></p><p>As for what Uncle Liu would become after being subjected to the soul control technique, Zhou You didn't have many qualms about it.</p><p></p><p>They came here looking for him, could it be anything good?</p><p></p><p>If he fell into their hands, he would likely face life or death.</p><p></p><p>Now Zhou You suspected that Wang Tiezhu might have been harmed by them.</p><p></p><p>"Why did you come looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't know how long the soul control technique's effects could last on Uncle Liu, after all the other party was a Foundation Establishment cultivator with powerful spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Uncle Liu didn't have much life left, so he had to ask what he wanted to know before Uncle Liu's life was exhausted.</p><p></p><p>So he went straight to the point, he wouldn't ask about those useless things.</p><p></p><p>Although Uncle Liu couldn't speak at first, it didn't mean he couldn't speak now.</p><p></p><p>His throat wasn't a problem, it was just the injury to his lungs that made it difficult for him to speak.</p><p></p><p>But now being controlled by the soul control technique, he disregarded his injuries, speaking at the cost of his life.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Liu paused for a moment, then began to answer: "The mission given to us by the Marquis of Lin'an was to control Xiao Yueying. You are the only one who can get close to Xiao Yueying, so we needed to control you first."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhou You was stunned for a moment. </p><p></p><p>It really wasn't about Huang Li's matter.</p><p></p><p>It was because of Xiao Yueying!</p><p></p><p>This was somewhat unexpected for Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>However, he quickly understood as well.</p><p></p><p>If his previous guess was correct, that the Marquis of Lin'an wanted to rebel against the Great Qi Imperial Dynasty, then as one of the great cultivating clans of Great Qi, the Xiao family of Nanzhou had dozens of Condensed Primordial cultivators, and even rumors of an elderly Yuanying Patriarch who had traversed the Deathly Trance.</p><p></p><p>If they could control Xiao Yueying, the talented daughter of the Xiao family, it should make the Xiao family wary.</p><p></p><p>Even if they couldn't truly control the Xiao family, Xiao Yueying could at least provide intelligence and be an insider for the Marquis of Lin'an.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that this time, it was because of Xiao Yueying's matter that he almost fell into the tiger's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You continued to ask: "Does the Marquis of Lin'an really want to rebel against the Great Qi Imperial Dynasty?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>"It's said the Marquis of Lin'an has no spiritual roots, which is why he was enfeoffed to Lin'an City. If he has no spiritual roots, how can he rebel against the Great Qi Imperial Dynasty?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know."</p><p></p><p>"Why did you betray Taibai Academy?"</p><p></p><p>"The roots of Taibai Academy have already rotted. The roots of the Great Qi Imperial Dynasty have also rotted. The Marquis of Lin'an promised to help me form my Nascent Soul."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhou You sighed.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, from top to bottom, Taibai Academy exuded an air of arrogance and rot.</p><p></p><p>"Cough coughâ€”"</p><p></p><p>Uncle Liu began coughing up blood, his life was about to come to an end.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhou You immediately asked: "Who in Taibai Academy are spies for the Marquis of Lin'an? Do you have any identifying tokens on you that can be used for locating purposes?"</p><p></p><p>I received news today that I failed to advance to the Three Rivers, this book will be published next Monday at 12pm, at which time I will directly explosive update around 20 chapters, please support.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 49</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Inside Elder Fang's storage bag, apart from some spirit pills used in the later stages of qi cultivation, there were more than three hundred low-grade spirit stones, a top-grade defensive magic treasure, and a top-grade flying sword. </p><p></p><p>As well as some jade slips and letters.</p><p></p><p>The jade slips recorded a list of scattered cultivators near the Cuiwei Market. These scattered cultivators all had certain skills, either being pill refiners, artifact refiners, talisman masters, or formation masters.</p><p></p><p>There were also some more niche professions, such as tea artists and brewmasters. </p><p></p><p>The Taibai Academy's sphere of influence was extremely vast, spanning thousands of miles. Within it, there were numerous unmanned spiritual mountains and caves that were unused, leaving them wasted. So they came up with a way to rent them out to those scattered cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the spiritual lands would not go to waste, and the Taibai Academy could also obtain some resources. </p><p></p><p>The scattered cultivators on these jade slips were the ones renting the Taibai Academy's spiritual mountains and caves. It seems Elder Fang and others collected them, having already planned this exclusive underground trade fair.</p><p></p><p>However, the jade slips and letters did not mention the purpose of holding this underground trade fair.</p><p></p><p>But those letters vaguely mentioned what the Wu Family was trying to do.</p><p></p><p>According to the information revealed in the letters, the Taibai Branch in Cuiwei Market had been completely controlled by the Wu Family, from the shopkeepers to the clerks, all of them were Wu Family people.</p><p></p><p>And that Wu Yong was also from the Wu Family, which is why Wu Yong could have a profession like an intermediary.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, he provided intelligence for the Wu Family, and on the other hand, he privately sold things from the Taibai Branch.</p><p></p><p>The actual person in control of the Taibai Branch in Cuiwei Market was Elder Fang.</p><p></p><p>This Elder Fang did not seem to be from the main bloodline of the Wu Family, but rather an illegitimate son of a high-ranking member of the Wu Family. Including the "Second Young Master" mentioned by Wu Yong, he was also an illegitimate son.</p><p></p><p>From the contents of the letters, it seems Elder Fang had been brainwashed by his father from the Fang Family, being extremely fanatical towards him and obeying his every command.</p><p></p><p>He would do anything to gain his father's approval.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his father promised that as long as he did a good job infiltrating the Taibai Academy, he would be allowed to return to the Wu Family when they eventually overthrew the Taibai Academy.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Elder Fang carefully preserved all these letters.</p><p></p><p>He was willing to treasure everything related to his father.</p><p></p><p>Originally, his father had instructed him to burn the letters after reading them.</p><p></p><p>"What a family, the Taibai Academy is the official cultivation force of the Great Qi Imperial Dynasty. This Wu Family wants to overthrow the Taibai Academy, aren't they going against the Great Qi Imperial Dynasty?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked at those letters and couldn't help but marvel.</p><p></p><p>He vaguely sensed that this matter was definitely not that simple.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Family was just a small local family in Lincheng City. At least to the Great Qi Imperial Dynasty, they were a small family, with only Spirit Condensation cultivators within. Did they really dare to confront the Great Qi Imperial Dynasty?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't believe they had the audacity for that.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Family must have someone backing them.</p><p></p><p>At least, in the letters, Zhou You saw mentions of the Righteous Alliance, including the person named "Meng Xun." It seems the Wu Family had some connection to the Righteous Alliance.</p><p></p><p>According to the latest letter, the checkpoint Luoshui Pass between Lincheng City and the Ten Thousand Mountains had seen a sudden increase in demonic beasts in recent months, which was related to Meng Xun.</p><p></p><p>Elder Fang's father hinted in his letter that he had some connection to Meng Xun.</p><p></p><p>"From the contents of the letters, it seems the Wu Family plans to make their move within the next ten to twenty years. Lincheng City will likely become an area of turmoil soon."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You silently deduced, "I must reach the Foundation Establishment realm within ten years, then leave this area of turmoil."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he collected all these letters.</p><p></p><p>Ten years of time...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In the meantime, it gave him enough time to prepare.</p><p></p><p>In any case, he should be safe for the next ten years. </p><p></p><p>As for these letters, Zhou You temporarily would not hand them over to the Taibai Academy.</p><p></p><p>Once these letters were exposed, the Wu family would definitely take action in advance, causing the entire Lin City to become unrest prematurely. This would lead to an unknown number of accidents, interrupting Zhou You's peaceful cultivation life.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, even if Zhou You wanted to hand over these letters, he would only do so after his cultivation reached the Foundation Establishment stage, before leaving.</p><p></p><p>After finishing these tasks, Zhou You put away all his belongings. He then disguised himself and set up a stall on the street, selling the useless items from Senior Martial Brother Fang and the others.</p><p></p><p>After all, the auction wouldn't be held for another three days. During this period of free time, it was better to sell these things.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, there were many cultivators in the Huangshan Market area, with countless people setting up stalls. Blending into the crowd and selling these items from a stall was actually the safest approach.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days passed. Zhou You sold all the newly acquired items either from his stall or by going to shops, including the sword for auction. In total, he obtained over 4,000 low-grade spirit stones, which could be considered very wealthy.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You did not sell the magic treasures of Senior Martial Brother Fang and the others, mainly because magic treasures have a certain uniqueness. Additionally, since Senior Martial Brother Fang and the young man with a flat face were from the Taibai Academy, the academy had probably already learned about their deaths.</p><p></p><p>For safety reasons, it was better to keep these magic treasures for now.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining over 4,000 spirit stones, plus the remaining 5,000 low-grade spirit stones from before, Zhou You did not keep them. Instead, he bought the items he needed.</p><p></p><p>He purchased a top-grade magic treasure-level alchemy furnace. For a long time to come, he would not return to the market area, and since he needed to learn alchemy, it was better to buy an alchemy furnace now.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, he bought some spirit herb seeds.</p><p></p><p>Now that his [Cultivation] skill had progressed, his ability to catalyze the growth of medicinal herbs had become stronger. With just 5 points of progress, he could shorten the growth cycle by one-fifth. If mastered, the effect would be extraordinary. These spirit herb seeds would come in handy then.</p><p></p><p>For the Qi Condensation stage, the pills required spirit herbs that only needed a few years to mature.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You could then be self-sufficient and meet the needs for ordinary alchemy.</p><p></p><p>Apart from these, Zhou You also purchased materials for crafting the Five Elements Formation flags and the Five Ghosts Killing Formation!</p><p></p><p>After witnessing the power of the Little Shocking Formation, Zhou You was quite eager to set up these two ancient formations as well.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had spirit stones, he naturally hoped to deploy these two formations.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, by mastering these two formations, he would gain the "Formation Mastery" trait.</p><p></p><p>After buying these items, Zhou You also purchased a top-grade magic treasure-level talisman pen, as well as a large amount of monster blood cinnabar and talisman papers that could be used to create first-grade mid-grade and top-grade talismans.</p><p></p><p>Especially for first-grade top-grade talisman papers, the replication cost was quite expensive, generally requiring talisman papers made from monster hides to withstand the spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>With top-grade talisman papers, Zhou You naturally needed to acquire the refinement methods for these two types of first-grade top-grade talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>This cost him another sum of spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>When Zhou You left the market area, he only had a little over 200 spirit stones left in his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You deliberately kept these 200-plus spirit stones to power the formations.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

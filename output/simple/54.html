        <h1>Chapter 54</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Just now, Zhou You used the mundane martial art skill called Thunder Fist. </p><p></p><p>This Thunder Fist has no real power. For cultivators, it can at most be used for strengthening the body. Its only advantage is its resounding force. If unleashed fully, each punch carries an immense force.</p><p></p><p>Especially with Zhou You's substantial spiritual power and bone power enhancing it, the force became even greater, like thunderclaps exploding.</p><p></p><p>Just now, Zhou You took advantage of this, momentarily startling the eel-like demonic beast, allowing him to break free from its suction force and seize the opportunity to escape to shore.</p><p></p><p>After reaching shore, Zhou You quickly put his clothes back on. He patted his storage bag and took out a fishing rod artifact. </p><p></p><p>This artifact was a reward Bai Chi Yu won from the annual grand competition last year. Later, out of gratitude, she gifted it to Zhou You. It's an excellent top-grade artifact.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had practiced with it many times over the past ten months and was very proficient in using it.</p><p></p><p>"Swish--"</p><p></p><p>The originally rippling lake surface with the moon's reflection shattered. A jet-black eel demonic beast surfaced, raising its huge head and staring fixedly at Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>This demonic beast was at least three zhang long, its surface completely covered in mucus and fleshy scales, with long whiskers like backward spines on both sides of its mouth.</p><p></p><p>After surfacing, the eel demonic beast opened its mouth towards Zhou You and spat out a dense black liquid.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's movements were agile and his reactions extremely fast. He retreated backwards, avoiding the attack of the black liquid.</p><p></p><p>"Hissss--"</p><p></p><p>The black liquid that fell on the ground instantly caused the weeds to wither and the ground to corrode into a black color, emitting dense smoke.</p><p></p><p>Such a toxic liquid!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's eyes flickered. With a flick of his wrist, the reel spun wildly, and the fishing line made from demonic beast tendons shot rapidly towards the eel demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You stimulated his six meridian channels simultaneously, channeling his dense spiritual power into the fishing rod artifact.</p><p></p><p>The fishing line flickered with red light, swiftly striking the eel demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>The artifact's fish hook was forged using a very special method from a unique material. Normally it was a steel spike about ten inches long and extremely sharp.</p><p></p><p>But once inside a demonic beast's body and controlled by spiritual power, it would bend into a large fish hook.</p><p></p><p>The hook would latch onto the demonic beast's bones. No matter how the beast struggled, it could not possibly escape.</p><p></p><p>"Screech--"</p><p></p><p>The hook struck the beast, and the eel demonic beast let out a shrill, miserable cry. It thrashed wildly in the lake, blood mixing with the water and spraying terrifying bloody blossoms.</p><p></p><p>It was clear the eel demonic beast was frantically trying to dive to the lake bottom to break free from the hook.</p><p></p><p>But once hooked, how could it possibly escape?</p><p></p><p>"Still want to flee?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You let out a cold snort. Concentrating his energy in his dantian, he exerted force through his whole body. Spiritual power surged into the fishing rod artifact, and he gave a fierce tug.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the fishing rod artifact unleashed its special ability - a binding force shot out along the line and landed on the demonic beast, instantly immobilizing the struggling eel.</p><p></p><p>This was a top-grade artifact after all. If it only had the ability to track demonic beasts, that would be too limited.</p><p></p><p>Many early Foundation Establishment cultivators used top-grade artifacts.</p><p></p><p>At the level of top-grade artifacts, they basically all had some special functions.</p><p></p><p>The special function of this fishing rod was tracking and binding.</p><p></p><p>With the artifact's binding effect taking hold, the eel demonic beast was finally fully surfaced.</p><p></p><p>Its body over three zhang long was covered in fleshy scales, with rows of backward-facing spines on its back, looking ferocious.</p><p></p><p>But now it floated motionlessly on the lake surface, only its rolling eyes filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You circulated his spiritual power, and the reel automatically rotated, retracting the line to pull the eel demonic beast to the shore. Then with a sudden forceful tug, he dragged the beast's huge body onto land.</p><p></p><p>After that, Zhou You adjusted his spiritual power, retracting the fishing line...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He pulled it back.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the struggling demonic beast, Zhou You did not hesitate at all. With a flick of his wrist, a flying sword flew out from his sleeve - it was the top-grade magic weapon Clear Shadow Sword. </p><p></p><p>With a "pu" sound, the Clear Shadow Sword sliced off the mudfish demonic beast's head, and fresh blood gushed out.</p><p></p><p>The mudfish demonic beast's body was restrained and unable to move, it could only twitch in place. </p><p></p><p>After more than ten breaths, the mudfish demonic beast finally became motionless, dead as could be.</p><p></p><p>The cold morning was filled with an intense bloody smell. Zhou You looked at the demonic beast's corpse, his gaze somewhat cold.</p><p></p><p>How could there be a demonic beast in this place?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked at the horizon, the moon had disappeared, a sliver of dawn light appeared in the east.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You did not ponder further. Instead, holding the Clear Shadow Sword, he peeled off the demonic beast's skin, then washed it clean in Erhai Lake.</p><p></p><p>This mudfish demonic beast was a water-attribute demonic beast. Its skin was excellent material for refining the Cold Element Talisman.</p><p></p><p>After cleaning the demonic beast skin, he also took out its demonic core. Without hesitation, Zhou You used the Green Element Spirit Fire to completely burn the demonic beast's corpse to ashes.</p><p></p><p>This demonic beast was a poisonous one, with a venom sac inside its body. No one knew if its meat was poisonous or not, so besides the skin and core, the rest was useless.</p><p></p><p>So cleaning it up was for the best.</p><p></p><p>After clearing the scene, it was already daylight.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You did not rest, and began tending to the herb field.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You was also pondering one question at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Why was there a demonic beast in Erhai Lake?</p><p></p><p>As far as Zhou You knew, Erhai Lake was covered by the Taibaik Academy's formation. Although this formation would not harm living beings, it also would not allow demonic beasts to be born, and any inside had long been cleared out.</p><p></p><p>Unless this demonic beast had entered Erhai Lake later.</p><p></p><p>If that was truly the case, then the situation was quite bad.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You could not help but recall the news he had inquired about previously in Neiji.</p><p></p><p>Recently, the number of demonic beasts around Luoshui Pass had increased significantly, there were even rumors that demonic beasts had appeared within the Pass itself.</p><p></p><p>Within the Pass, meaning the entire Lincheng region.</p><p></p><p>Lincheng was not a massive city like others, but rather was composed of dozens of towns scattered across thousands of miles of mountains, rivers and marshlands.</p><p></p><p>Luoshui Pass separated the Outer Hundred Thousand Mountains from Lincheng.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the Sword Immortal Taibai founded Taibai Academy, leading the Taixuan Sect, Yulin Mountain Manor and three cultivator clans to exterminate the demonic beasts within the Pass, not a single demonic beast had been seen for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>All demonic beasts lived in the Outer Hundred Thousand Mountains.</p><p></p><p>However, with demonic beasts now appearing within the Pass, this matter seemed rather strange.</p><p></p><p>If it was just a rumor before without real proof, then the mudfish demonic beast appearing in Erhai Lake almost certainly confirmed that demonic beasts had indeed appeared within the Pass.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Righteous Qi Alliance has made a move again."</p><p></p><p>From the letters of Senior Brother Fang previously, Zhou You judged that the surge of demonic beasts outside the Pass was related to the Righteous Qi Alliance elder "Meng Xun."</p><p></p><p>Now with demonic beasts appearing inside the Pass, it was likely also connected to this "Meng Xun."</p><p></p><p>"When the sky falls, there will be a tall one to prop it up."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You shook his head and began chopping wood to improve his [Lumbering] skill.</p><p></p><p>His [Lumbering] progress was already at 92 points, about to be fully mastered. Naturally, Zhou You prioritized improving it.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, another month passed.</p><p></p><p>On this day, as Zhou You was chopping firewood, a long rainbow appeared in the sky. That rainbow moved extremely fast, originally passing by Zhou You's hut, but for some unknown reason it turned back and landed by the shore of Erhai Lake.</p>

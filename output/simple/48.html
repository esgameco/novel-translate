        <h1>Chapter 48</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Zhou You carefully examined that golden talisman and could feel the powerful aura emanating from it - at least at the Foundation Establishment level. </p><p></p><p>However, it didn't seem to be an offensive talisman, but rather an auxiliary one.</p><p></p><p>"A flight talisman?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was somewhat surprised, not expecting this talisman to be a flight talisman. </p><p></p><p>A flight talisman was something refined by cultivators at the Foundation Establishment level that allowed sword-flying cultivators to use it to multiply their flight speed several times over. For cultivators unable to sword-fly, using it would grant them temporary flight capabilities.</p><p></p><p>Crucially, after using this talisman, the user would gain considerable defensive power and be able to withstand quite a few attacks while in flight, ensuring their safe escape.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined this guy would have such a formidable talisman.  </p><p></p><p>It seemed his status in the Wu Family was definitely not low.</p><p></p><p>Without further ado,Zhou You collected all the valuables, then put away the talisman array of the Minor Shocking Formation. As he pondered whether to destroy the bodies, a thought suddenly occurred to him.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You took out the white jade sword bone and tossed it onto Fang Shixiong's body.  </p><p></p><p>The commotion here was quite loud, and the Tao Bai Academy would surely have patrolling disciples arrive at this location before long. At that time, they would definitely discover this white jade sword bone.</p><p></p><p>With that, the plan could begin!</p><p></p><p>The timing of Fang Shixiong and the others appearing was truly impeccable!</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Zhou You swiftly departed towards Huangshan Town.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as Zhou You had guessed, a little over half a shi later, a six-person patrol squad from Tao Bai Academy rushed over.</p><p></p><p>The six Tao Bai disciples moved at extreme speeds, weaving through the forest, before finally landing beside the corpses of Fang Shixiong and the others.</p><p></p><p>"People here!" one Tao Bai disciple called out.</p><p></p><p>The one leading them was a strapping young man with a resolute gaze and full of righteous air, who appeared only seventeen or eighteen years old, yet his cultivation was already at the eighth level of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>"Little Brother Lin, it seems to be Senior Brother Fang and the others!" another disciple reported after checking the three bodies.</p><p></p><p>The other disciples, seeing Fang Shixiong's tragic state, could hardly bear to look directly at it.</p><p></p><p>The resolute young man beside the slender, handsome young lady said, "Lin Feng, could it be the Righteous Alliance behind this? They're too brazen, actually daring to kill Tao Bai disciples within our academy's domain!"</p><p></p><p>This resolute young man was none other than the great young master of the Lin Family, Lin Feng!</p><p></p><p>Lin Feng shook his head. After carefully examining Fang Shixiong and the others' condition, he picked up three identity tokens. Aside from the horse-faced youth, the tokens of Fang Shixiong and Wu Yong were from the Wu Family.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, something's not right!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Feng flipped over Fang Shixiong's body and discovered a mask on his back, then found the same masks on the horse-faced youth and Wu Yong as well.</p><p></p><p>"They weren't wearing our academy's disciple robes, and were even wearing masks. The situation seems rather strange."</p><p></p><p>Lin Feng analyzed, "Moreover, look at these items taken from their bodies - if we rule out framing, their identities are doubtful. I suggest first notifying the Law Enforcement Hall to investigate these three individuals' identities."</p><p></p><p>The others looked at each other, then all nodded in agreement with Lin Feng's proposal.</p><p></p><p>Lin Feng then took out a jade slip, crushed it, and only then did he pick up the white jade sword bone to examine it from all angles.</p><p></p><p>The beautiful young lady asked, "Lin Feng, what is this?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Feng shook his head. "Unclear. It has no spiritual power, no restrictions, no formations, no signs of being refined. It looks like a decorative item. Let's wait for the Law Enforcement Hall to arrive before saying more."</p><p></p><p>So Lin Feng waited on the spot while the others searched the surrounding area.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, at this moment Zhuo You had passed through Qiao Town and was heading towards Huangshan Town.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Disguising himself, Zhouyou sneaked into the Huangshan Market. </p><p></p><p>The Huangshan Market was very lively recently because an auction was going to be held, so many cultivators from the Taibai Academy and nearby cities had rushed over.</p><p></p><p>The entire Huangshan Market was extremely lively and crowded with cultivators everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou headed straight to the Taibai Street in the market to auction off his top-grade flying sword without any attributes. It was eventually estimated at 1,100 spirit stones, allowing the auction to proceed. </p><p></p><p>Zhouyou then took the contract and casually found an inn to stay in. After setting up the Small Shocking Formation around the area, he finally took out the storage bags of Senior Martial Brother Fang and the other two.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Zhouyou had roughly scanned the three's storage bags with his divine sense, so he had a general understanding of their contents.</p><p></p><p>In the horse-faced youth's bag, there wasn't much valuable - only a middle-grade flying sword, a middle-grade hammer-type weapon, some low-level cultivation manuals, not many talisman papers and pills, and just over 50 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>This really didn't seem like the possession of a sixth-layer Qi Refining cultivator from Taibai Academy.  </p><p></p><p>But thinking carefully, it was understandable. Ordinary cultivators who didn't have anything special they wanted to buy usually wouldn't hoard spirit stones. Any spirit stones they had would mostly be used to purchase pills to increase their cultivation or weapons to increase their strength.</p><p></p><p>"Well, there is a Moon Viewing Pill though, so this guy probably didn't have confidence in breaking through to the seventh Qi Refining layer and bought it as a foundation."</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou muttered to himself as he collected all of the horse-faced youth's belongings into his own storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Next were the bags of Senior Martial Brother Fang and Wu Yong.</p><p></p><p>First was Wu Yong's bag, which pleasantly surprised Zhouyou.</p><p></p><p>There were six middle-grade spirit stones alone!</p><p></p><p>And as many as 560 low-grade spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>Converting them all to low-grade, that was 1,160 spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>No wonder he was a middleman - he was quite wealthy!</p><p></p><p>Richer than those few con men!</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was also possible that Wu Yong had just finished a deal with someone and hadn't had a chance to hand over the spirit stones and goods to the organization behind him before coming with Senior Brother Fang to chase after Zhouyou.</p><p></p><p>Because not only did Zhouyou see over a thousand spirit stones in the bag, there was also an Alchemist's Inheritance!</p><p></p><p>Wu Yong clearly wasn't an alchemist himself, otherwise they wouldn't have needed to look for one. This Alchemist's Inheritance must have been something he acquired.</p><p></p><p>With Zhouyou's Golden Imprint of "The Way of Simplicity", alchemy was a skill he would inevitably need to study.</p><p></p><p>Obtaining an Alchemist's Inheritance now was a good gain.</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou took out the jade slip, scanned it with his divine sense, and stored it in his own bag.</p><p></p><p>Alchemy wasn't something that could be mastered overnight, it required gradual study.</p><p></p><p>Now wasn't the time to research it, he could do so after returning.</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou then roughly estimated the value of the other items in Wu Yong's bag. Not counting the Alchemist's Inheritance and spirit stones, it was worth around 1,000 spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>In other words, Wu Yong alone brought Zhouyou over 2,000 spirit stones worth of value!</p><p></p><p>This made Zhouyou's eyes shine, as he could use these things to purchase more cultivation resources!</p><p></p><p>After storing everything away, Zhouyou began inspecting Senior Martial Brother Fang's bag.</p><p></p><p>While Fang's bag may not have had the most resources, it was definitely the most valuable!</p><p></p><p>There were many letters that allowed Zhouyou to understand Fang's true identity and the real reason he had infiltrated Taibai Academy.</p><p></p><p>"Good lord, the Wu Family...how dare they try to make a move against Taibai Academy?"</p><p></p><p>Zhouyou muttered, feeling a storm was brewing.</p>

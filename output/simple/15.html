        <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing left, riding away on a white jade dragon horse. </p><p></p><p>Watching Xiao Qing's departing back, Zhou You's expression gradually turned cold.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the porcelain bottle in his hand with an unstable expression. </p><p></p><p>Opening the porcelain bottle, he saw three azure-colored pellets inside, with faint golden lines running across them. They gave off a rich medicinal fragrance, and just smelling them made one feel refreshed.</p><p></p><p>"First-grade low-rank pellets!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had heard about the ranks of pellets from Huang Li.</p><p></p><p>For those in the Qi Refining stage, they took first-grade pellets. Those at the first to third level of Qi Refining used low-rank first-grade pellets, those from the fourth to sixth level used mid-rank first-grade pellets, and after the sixth level of Qi Refining, they used high-rank first-grade pellets.</p><p></p><p>As for the pellets themselves, one spirit line indicated a low-rank pellet, two lines a mid-rank, and three lines a high-rank pellet.</p><p></p><p>The pellets in this porcelain bottle were low-rank first-grade ones.</p><p></p><p>Although low-rank, they were still extremely precious, not something commoners like him could possess.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't know what kind of pellets they were, but roughly estimated that these three pellets were probably worth around fifty spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Would the noble young lady really bestow three such precious pellets for the cultivation of a commoner like him?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You remained doubtful.</p><p></p><p>Thus, he didn't dare easily consume these three pellets. He temporarily put them away, then went to the lake to continue fishing.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>It took Xiao Qing less than the time to burn one incense stick to return to the small courtyard and see Xiao Yue Ying.</p><p></p><p>In the largest room of the inner courtyard.</p><p></p><p>This place was rich in spiritual energy. A young lady grasped two spirit stones in her hands, sitting cross-legged on the spirit gathering formation's meditation mat to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>The lady wore a pale green long dress. Her figure was exquisite, her face delicate, her long hair hung over her shoulders, and her skin was as fair as jade - like a fairy from the forest.</p><p></p><p>She was none other than the Xiao family's young lady, Xiao Yue Ying!</p><p></p><p>Not long after, footsteps could be heard outside.</p><p></p><p>"Young Lady, I'm back."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing's voice came from outside.</p><p></p><p>"Come in," Xiao Yue Ying's voice was cold and emotionless.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing pushed open the door, entered the room, closed it behind her, then knelt before Xiao Yue Ying. "Young Lady, Zhou You has not left, and the pellets have been delivered to him!"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yue Ying gave a slight "nn" sound, her red lips parting slightly. "Did he show any abnormalities?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing said, "No, he was very grateful to the Young Lady for the pellets."</p><p></p><p>She paused, then added, "Young Lady, don't you think this was a bit excessive? Zhou You definitely would not easily leave the Xiao family..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps," Xiao Yue Ying waved her hand, dismissing Xiao Qing.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, only Xiao Yue Ying remained in the room. She opened her eyes, her long lashes trembling slightly, her pupils like autumn waters.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect Lin Feng's cultivation to progress so quickly. He may be able to form his foundation soon."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yue Ying's eyes turned somewhat cold, then she sighed lightly, "I hope I can break through to the Pill Formation stage within twenty years. Otherwise...I'll have to use that method."</p><p></p><p>There were four major realms in cultivation: Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment, Pill Formation, and Natal Spiritual Stage.</p><p></p><p>Advancing in each realm was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators were stuck in the Qi Refining stage, unable to break through.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yue Ying had an extraordinary spiritual root, a rare premium grade. She began cultivating at five years old and was now twenty-six, already at the middle stage of Foundation Establishment - unmatched in the southern region among her peers. She was praised as the Xiao family's most likely to reach the Natal Spiritual Stage.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, she had little confidence in advancing to the Pill Formation stage. To reach it would require a long period of bitter cultivation. Making it to the peak of Foundation Establishment within twenty years would already be impressive.</p><p></p><p>For an ordinary person to form their Pill foundation before a hundred years of age was considered talented.</p><p></p><p>Originally, she wasn't in a hurry, but after breaking off her engagement with Lin Feng and setting the hundred-year agreement, Lin Feng had now returned to being a renowned genius. Within just a few months, he had made a huge impact in Lin City, causing Xiao Yue Ying to feel pressured.</p><p></p><p>To scheme for reaching Pill Formation, she had two plans prepared. Besides the normal path of breaking through, there was also Zhou You!</p><p></p><p>Although Zhou You only had an inferior spiritual root, his root type was the same as hers. Moreover, through special means of detection, she discovered that Zhou You possessed a Pill Spiritual Root.</p><p></p><p>This kind of root had nothing to do with spiritual roots, but those who had it were well-suited for taking the path of pill refinement. But similarly...it made him extremely suitable for her to use a certain heretical technique to break through to Pill Formation.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yue Ying had her own pride...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The marriage agreement was terminated by her own initiative. She did not want to see Lin Feng, who was called a waste, gradually catch up to her. </p><p></p><p>So when it came to the critical moment, she would not hesitate to sacrifice Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhou You was unaware of Xiao Yueying's plan, nor did he know that he had some spiritual roots. After Xiao Qing left, he began fishing for spiritual fish.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the sword-wielding girl came to a place two miles away again. </p><p></p><p>She glanced at Zhou You, and when she saw Zhou You also looking in her direction, she quickly averted her gaze, then took out her fishing rod and began fishing for the day.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You shook his head, already accustomed to the existence of the sword-wielding girl. </p><p></p><p>He knew that the other party simply came to fish, and would not threaten him.</p><p></p><p>Following his usual habit, Zhou You cast bait and made a nest, then silently fished.</p><p></p><p>However, he was a bit absent-minded today and could not control the efficiency well. Just two minutes later, he caught the first spiritual fish.</p><p></p><p>This made the girl a bit envious, secretly glancing over here several times.</p><p></p><p>But she did not come over to greet him, nor did she speak.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Zhou You completed today's task, deftly reeled in his rod, returned to the thatched hut, and began preparing lunch.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, Zhou You had only reached the second level of qi cultivation and could not survive without food. In fact, due to the need for sword practice, his appetite was even greater than ordinary people's.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sword-wielding girl glanced at Zhou You's thatched hut and saw wispy cooking smoke rising from inside. She hurriedly grabbed a handful of bait and imitated Zhou You's movements, casting it into the lake and waiting quietly for the fish to bite.</p><p></p><p>A look of anticipation appeared on the girl's exquisite, fair face.</p><p></p><p>She had been fishing for spiritual fish here for more than twenty days.</p><p></p><p>Not a single one had been caught.</p><p></p><p>In the past, whenever she came, Zhou You had already started fishing, so she had not seen any of Zhou You's techniques.</p><p></p><p>This time, she finally started fishing before Zhou You, clearly observing Zhou You's fishing techniques.</p><p></p><p>The girl felt that she had grasped the skill of catching spiritual fish and would soon be able to catch one.</p><p></p><p>So the sword-wielding girl sat upright, staring intently at the fishing line.</p><p></p><p>Another stick of incense time passed, but the lake surface remained calm without any movement.</p><p></p><p>A look of disappointment appeared on the sword-wielding girl's face.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>The sword-wielding girl frowned and looked down at the shore.</p><p></p><p>There was a loach flapping its tail, swimming back and forth along the shore, occasionally poking its head out to breathe.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the sword-wielding girl revealed a hint of delight.</p><p></p><p>She dropped the fishing rod in her hand, stretched out her slender palm, and snatched at the loach.</p><p></p><p>The loach had no ability to resist and flew straight into her hand.</p><p></p><p>The chill vanished from the girl's body as joy lit up her face. Hugging the loach, she transformed into a rainbow and swiftly departed.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You, holding a bowl at the thatched hut entrance, was dumbstruck seeing this scene.</p><p></p><p>It took more than ten breaths before Zhou You finally uttered a few words: "Unchivalrous!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next morning, after Zhou You finished cultivating, he checked the words on the golden token. The progress of the 'Kai Mai Jue' had reached 97%, needing only three more days of practice to fully master this most important technique.</p><p></p><p>He had to find a way to obtain the intermediate section of the 'Kai Mai Jue' soon.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, his cultivation would stagnate.</p><p></p><p>After tending to the vegetables in the field, Zhou You thought for a moment and headed to a cluster of thatched huts thirty miles away.</p><p></p><p>This was a place called the Fishermen's Lodge that Huang Li had mentioned to him before, where some fishermen would gather to chat and exchange information.</p><p></p><p>There were not many people at the Fishermen's Lodge, only four. After Zhou You arrived and introduced himself, those fishermen welcomed him quite warmly, each introducing themselves.</p><p></p><p>Then, they began discussing matters related to the Righteous Qi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You actually came here to try and find out from the side where he could obtain the intermediate section of the 'Kai Mai Jue'.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, he ended up learning about the Righteous Qi Alliance and Huang Li instead!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

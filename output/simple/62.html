            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>【Sword Flight (1/100): The most common means of flight in the cultivation world. Frequent practice will eventually lead to success.】</p><p></p><p>Seeing this line of text on the golden talisman, Zhou You's eyes flickered slightly. </p><p></p><p>It even recorded Sword Flight?</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what enhancements mastering 【Sword Flight】 would bring him.</p><p></p><p>Faster flight speed? </p><p></p><p>That was very likely.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was quite looking forward to it.</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation world, speed was also very important. Those with fast movement speed had a great advantage in battles. Even if they couldn't win, they could still flee.</p><p></p><p>Nothing was more important than preserving one's life.</p><p></p><p>Since the golden talisman recorded "Sword Flight", as long as he practiced, he would surely succeed!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You gathered his mind and returned to the wooden hut, taking out the materials to refine a small Five Phase Formation flag.</p><p></p><p>The small Five Phase Formation had both offensive and defensive capabilities. Its power depended mainly on the quality of the flag. If of good quality, it could block and injure cultivators at the Foundation Establishment stage.  </p><p></p><p>Previously, Zhou You had not attempted refining one, mainly because his cultivation base was insufficient to sustain the use of the Primordial Spiritual Fire.</p><p></p><p>Now at the 7th level of Qi Cultivation, coupled with his spirit force being more refined than ordinary cultivators, it was the perfect time to refine the flag.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had a total of ten sets of materials, not knowing if he could refine a highest quality flag.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Zhou You patted his storage bag, and a refining cauldron flew out.</p><p></p><p>This top-grade refining cauldron was part of the spoils Zhou You received after killing those Upright Path Alliance cultivators at White Pool Fish.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You figured he would use it eventually, so he didn't sell it.</p><p></p><p>The steps of refining were largely similar to pill refining: preheating, refining, fusing, casting the embryo, quenching, and shaping - six steps in total.</p><p></p><p>The most troublesome was the quenching stage, which not only had extremely strict requirements for the fire control, but also required imprinting numerous formations or inscribing various spirit symbols during the quenching process, placing extremely high demands on one's spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>Those with weak spiritual sense would find it very difficult to control the fire while laying formations simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You was quite confident in his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>His current spiritual sense was infinitely close to the initial Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>"Poof—"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You raised his hand, and the Primordial Spiritual Fire appeared in his palm, already the size of a barrel.</p><p></p><p>Now the progress of 【Primordial Spiritual Fire】 had reached 95%, about to be completed. Its temperature was extremely high; Zhou You estimated that no one below the Foundation Establishment stage could withstand this Primordial Spiritual Fire.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, Zhou You enveloped the refining cauldron with the Primordial Spiritual Fire, beginning to heat it.</p><p></p><p>An hour later, the materials for refining the Wood Phase flag flew into the cauldron, gradually melting.</p><p></p><p>Since the Wood Phase flag was of the wood attribute, Zhou You started with it for practice, which would naturally be easier for him.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the various materials melted inside. Zhou You quickly fused them together, gradually forming a small flag the size of a palm.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial part of refining was the quenching. Fusing and casting the embryo were not as demanding as pill refining; once fused, it was done.</p><p></p><p>After the embryonic form of the Wood Phase flag appeared, Zhou You wasted no time, making hand seals and imprinting numerous formations.</p><p></p><p>These formations were all recorded in the Small Five Phase Formation, all imprinted onto the Wood Phase flag.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Zhou You controlled the Primordial Spiritual Fire to surge into the refining cauldron, beginning to temper the embryo.</p><p></p><p>As formation after formation entered and the Primordial Spiritual Fire tempered it, the Wood Phase flag gradually emanated a faint aura.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You knew that aura came entirely from the formations within the Small Five Phase Formation.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Half an hour passed in a blink, and as Zhou You's spirit force was about to be depleted, the Primordial Spiritual Fire retreated, and he stopped. The Wood Phase flag in the refining cauldron began to gradually cool and take shape, eventually forming a pale green small flag the size of a palm.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You raised his hand, summoning the small flag to fly into his grasp.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"This is the Wood Formation Flag!"</p><p></p><p>Zhougame's eyes flashed, his gaze burning with intensity. </p><p></p><p>Although the quality of this flag was poor, at most equivalent to a mid-grade magic treasure, even if arrayed in formation it could only threaten a 7th level Qi Refiner.</p><p></p><p>But at least he had succeeded this time.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the main reason Zhougame succeeded was because he was refining a formation flag. As long as he followed the proper methods, he would basically succeed. </p><p></p><p>If he tried refining other magic treasures, he would likely fail, or at best only produce low-grade ones.</p><p></p><p>[Minor Five Phase Formation (2/100): A rather complex ancient formation array. Progress is gained based on the quality of the formation flag refined. Completing three equivalent formations can activate the "Formation Mastery" trait.]</p><p></p><p>The golden seal flickered unsteadily, a line of text appearing on it.</p><p></p><p>Zhougame's consciousness sank inward as he saw this line of text.</p><p></p><p>As expected, the Minor Five Phase Formation had been recorded, but the way progress was gained was somewhat different.</p><p></p><p>For the Minor Shocking Formation, successfully refining a talisman gave 2 progress, while failure still gave 1.</p><p></p><p>But for the Minor Five Phase Formation, you had to successfully refine a formation flag to gain progress, with the amount depending on the flag's quality.</p><p></p><p>The Wood Formation Flag he just refined was mid-grade magic treasure level, so he gained 2 progress points.</p><p></p><p>A low-grade would be 1 point then, a high-grade 3 points, and an supreme-grade 4 points.</p><p></p><p>After that, Zhougame also saw the "Formation Mastery" trait again.</p><p></p><p>This made Zhougame quite anticipant.</p><p></p><p>Zhougame closed his eyes and began recovering his magic power, simultaneously circulating the Tempering Bone Scripture, handling two things at once - recovering magic power while tempering his body.</p><p></p><p>Once his magic power recovered, Zhougame refined another formation flag.</p><p></p><p>He repeated this process over and over. More than ten days passed.</p><p></p><p>Zhougame exhausted all the materials he had collected and finally refined a supreme-grade Five Phase Formation Flag.  </p><p></p><p>"It's fortunate I was just refining these simple Five Phase formation flags. If I tried refining ordinary magic treasures, I'd be lucky to make mid-grade ones."</p><p></p><p>Zhougame looked at the five-colored formation flags hovering before him, unable to hide his satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>These Five Phase Formation Flags emanated a faint luminous glow, their luster extremely brilliant - all supreme-grade magic treasure level.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these supreme-grade magic treasures were vastly inferior to standard supreme-grade ones, not even qualifying as true magic treasures, just having that level of quality.</p><p></p><p>Zhougame didn't waste any more words, immediately taking the Five Phase Formation Flags and arraying them to form the Minor Five Phase Formation.</p><p></p><p>This highest quality Minor Five Phase Formation could withstand an early Foundation Establishment cultivator. Combined with the Minor Shocking Formation, even if such a cultivator did come, they would be forced to leave disappointed!</p><p></p><p>With this, although Zhougame's cultivation was still at the 7th level of Qi Refining, his security had greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>Who could have imagined that this small menial laborer, appearing to only be at the 1st level of Qi Refining, actually possessed the means to deal with Foundation Establishment cultivators?</p><p></p><p>And Zhougame hadn't even fully displayed his abilities yet. If he also set up the Five Fiends Subjugation Formation, with all three formations together, he didn't know what level of power he could reach.</p><p></p><p>After setting up the Minor Five Phase Formation, not only did Zhougame's security increase, but his spiritual sense also greatly expanded again, increasing another 40 zhang!</p><p></p><p>It had now reached 300 zhang, stronger than any Qi Refining cultivator's spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>Next up after the Minor Five Phase Formation was the Five Fiends Subjugation Formation.</p>

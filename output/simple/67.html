            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Under Zhou You's gaze, the golden seal in his consciousness flickered incessantly, with golden light gushing out like a waterfall. </p><p></p><p>[Cultivation: (100/100) An extremely profound study that requires daily nourishment of spirit objects with spiritual power. Over time, it can increase the growth rate.]</p><p></p><p>[Cultivation Complete, Gained Trait: A Year of Three Autumns]</p><p></p><p>[A Year of Three Autumns: Activate the power of the golden seal to grant a cultivated plant a thousand-fold increase in growth rate. Can only catalyze one plant at a time.]</p><p></p><p>Seeing the three lines of text on the golden seal, Zhou You couldn't help but narrow his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>A thousand-fold growth rate?</p><p></p><p>So one year is equivalent to a thousand years? </p><p></p><p>This trait is simply too monstrously good!</p><p></p><p>How scarce are thousand-year spirit herbs in this world?</p><p></p><p>Yet for cultivators, time becomes worthless in the later stages, often measured in decades.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the effect of this trait becomes greater the further one advances.</p><p></p><p>One can imagine a Spirit Embryo cultivator casually closing in seclusion for several decades.</p><p></p><p>Upon emerging, they would possess dozens of thousand-year spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>Or even several myriad-year spirit herbs!</p><p></p><p>The value would be incalculable!</p><p></p><p>"A Year of Three Autumns...one day equals three years, makes sense!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You revealed a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>Three autumns refers to three years.</p><p></p><p>Three years is 1,095 days.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was very satisfied with this "A Year of Three Autumns" trait. In the future, when refining spirit pills, he would almost never worry about lacking key ingredients.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, after reaching the Foundation Establishment stage, many spirit pills require specific key ingredients.</p><p></p><p>These key ingredients may not be particularly rare spirit herbs, but they definitely require a high age.</p><p></p><p>Especially after pill congealment, it's common to need spirit herbs over a thousand years old as the key ingredient.</p><p></p><p>Such items are priceless and can only be obtained through luck when purchasing.</p><p></p><p>But with the "A Year of Three Autumns" trait, there's no need to worry.</p><p></p><p>He only needs to acquire the corresponding seeds or seedlings.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's eyes flickered as he looked towards a pale purple strange spirit grass in the herb garden.</p><p></p><p>This grass had thick stems and large leaves, with strange patterns on the leaves that curled up, resembling a monkey's face.</p><p></p><p>Hence, this grass was named Purple Monkey Leaf.</p><p></p><p>If the Purple Monkey Leaf was only a few decades old, it would be an ordinary spirit herb, used as an ingredient for refining Earth Element Pills.</p><p></p><p>However, if it reached over eight hundred years old, it would become a key ingredient for refining Foundation Establishment Pills.</p><p></p><p>Foundation Establishment Pills are extremely rare, and low-grade and mid-grade spiritual roots almost always require them to advance to the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>But these are completely controlled by major powers, and even disciples of the Tao White Academy must make exceptional contributions to obtain them.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, if they appear in auctions, they could be driven up to four or five thousand spirit stones each.</p><p></p><p>One should know that ordinary wandering cultivators may not even be able to earn two thousand spirit stones in a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>This shows how precious these pills are, and an eight-hundred-year-old Purple Monkey Leaf as the key ingredient is naturally extremely valuable.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's mind stirred, and the golden seal in his consciousness flickered with golden light. Then, one of the golden lights flew out along his fingers and landed on the Purple Monkey Leaf.</p><p></p><p>The golden light sank into the Purple Monkey Leaf and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>It didn't seem abnormal, but Zhou You observed with his spiritual sense and discovered that the spiritual power of this grass was increasing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Purple Monkey Leaf grew taller, and its leaves began to tremble as the patterns on them started changing.</p><p></p><p>It was truly a visible growth rate!</p><p></p><p>"Indeed a thousand-fold growth rate!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>He then tried to activate the power of the golden seal again to catalyze another spirit herb, but found that the golden seal in his consciousness remained motionless.</p><p></p><p>Oh well, it seems he couldn't catalyze a second one.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You wasn't discouraged, as he was already very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Come to think of it, this is my first time being able to voluntarily activate the power of the golden seal. This golden seal's power..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The power of the golden light was truly miraculous. </p><p></p><p>Zhou You secretly thought: "If one day I could completely master the golden seal, what kind of situation would that be?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You felt some anticipation, but then shook his head: "For now, I'm just a cultivator at the 7th level of Qi refining, I should focus on improving my cultivation first."</p><p></p><p>After a while, Zhou You had a question - if this golden light fell on other living beings, would it have any special effects? </p><p></p><p>For example, would it cause animals to consume their life force faster, or...would they be unable to withstand this power and explode instantly?</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Zhou You withdrew the golden light from the violet ape leaf, quickly went to the chicken coop he had set up, raised his hand and shot the golden light into a chicken's body, observing the changes.</p><p></p><p>However, after an hour passed, the chicken showed no changes at all.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that this golden light had no effect on animals.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had initially thought that if the chicken couldn't withstand the golden light's power and exploded, then this light could be used against enemies by shooting it into their bodies, making him invincible.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he couldn't exploit this bug.</p><p></p><p>He could only temporarily give up and return the golden light to the violet ape leaf in the medicinal field.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, not bad, mastering [Cultivation] has further enhanced my physical body."</p><p></p><p>After the joy from gaining the trait subsided,Zhou You began examining the changes to his body.</p><p></p><p>In addition to giving him the "Three Autumns in One Day" trait, mastering [Cultivation] had enhancedZhou You's physical strength.</p><p></p><p>Although he was still at the 8th level of Body Tempering, he was not far from the 9th level.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Long Spring Skill, with the improvement of his physical body, Zhou You's Bone Tempering Technique had also greatly improved.</p><p></p><p>Reaching 70 points, it wouldn't take long to master it completely.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Having gained the "Three Autumns in One Day" trait,Zhou You was very satisfied and returned to his wooden hut with a calm mind.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, things became peaceful.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's cultivation proceeded steadily.</p><p></p><p>On regular days, besides cultivating the Long Spring Skill and Bone Tempering Technique, he also observed the changes in the violet ape leaf, able to see its different transformations each day.</p><p></p><p>The "Three Autumns in One Day" effect was indeed powerful.</p><p></p><p>In addition to focusing on cultivating the Bone Tempering Technique, Zhou You was also steadily progressing in [Fishing Spirit Fish - Intermediate 1st Grade].</p><p></p><p>He looked forward to this [Fishing Spirit Fish - Intermediate 1st Grade] quite a bit, as even at the low grade level, it had given him a significant increase in reaction ability.</p><p></p><p>So far, it seemed fishing spirit fish was the only way to gain a reaction ability bonus.</p><p></p><p>The reaction ability bonus provided a huge advantage in body cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Apart from this,Zhou You was also searching for other life skills.</p><p></p><p>Currently, apart from fishing spirit fish, Zhou You only had the [Cooking] life skill left.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, even after four months,Zhou You had not found any other life skills.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You had finally mastered the Bone Tempering Technique.</p><p></p><p>With the mastery of the Bone Tempering Technique, Zhou You could clearly feel the changes in his body.</p><p></p><p>[Bone Tempering Technique (100/100): A rather superior body cultivation method for the Qi Refining stage. Daily practice will eventually lead to success.]</p><p></p><p>With a flash of golden light,Zhou You's body cultivation realm leapt up in this moment, reaching the 9th level of Body Tempering!</p><p></p><p>The highest level of Body Tempering!</p><p></p><p>Layer after layer of impurities seeped out from his pores, and Zhous You's bones made "crackling" sounds in this moment.</p><p></p><p>His whole body became more upright, his muscles slightly bulging, his angles more defined, exuding an aura of yang vigor.</p><p></p><p>Looking inwardly, Zhous You saw a layer of white Qi energy covering all the bones in his body.</p><p></p><p>This was bone Qi!</p><p></p><p>Once fully condensed, it could withstand attacks from the early Foundation Establishment stage!</p><p></p><p>However, this was not the most important thing.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, after reaching the 9th level of Body Tempering, Zhous You could finally cultivate the Foundation Establishment technique Green Primordial Body!</p><p></p><p>He could finally touch the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>Given time, he would definitely be able to break through to Foundation Establishment!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 71</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator was a middle-aged man with a sallow complexion and a thin mustache. </p><p></p><p>It was none other than Master Liu, the lecturer at Taibai Academy where Zhou You first went to listen to the Dao!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You, hiding in the shadows watching this scene, had his eyes flickering. </p><p></p><p>Why was Master Liu following Mu Jihan and treating him with such deference?</p><p></p><p>And Mu Jihan, concealing his cultivation level, had joined Taibai Academy under the guise of being the young master of Linan Prefecture - there must be a reason behind this.</p><p></p><p>"The illusion they saw should also be about Meng Xun. From Master Liu's words, we can conclude that Meng Xun is working for Linan Prefecture, which means..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You thought to this point, his throat tightening, an astounding secret about to come out!</p><p></p><p>"Linan Prefecture is the major power behind the Righteous Alliance! It seems this Marquis of Linan is definitely not just an ordinary mortal marquis. Perhaps...he is also concealing his cultivation level."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You analyzed quietly: "If these guesses are all true, then Mu Jihan infiltrating Taibai Academy must have an objective. Could it be...because of the matter with Huang Li?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan approached Zhou You, then found his residence, which made Zhou You subconsciously think of the Huang Li incident.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't quite seem right.</p><p></p><p>For the Huang Li matter, he hadn't revealed any clues, so it was unlikely.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a mere Huang Li wasn't worth a young marquis risking himself.</p><p></p><p>No matter how he thought about it, he couldn't figure it out. Could it be because of Xiao Yueying?</p><p></p><p>If not Huang Li, then he could only be connected to Xiao Yueying.</p><p></p><p>But...that didn't seem likely either.</p><p></p><p>However, one thing was certain - the Marquis of Linan from Linan Prefecture was probably going to rebel against the Great Qi imperial court.</p><p></p><p>So he propped up the Righteous Alliance, causing trouble in Lincheng, while also covertly controlling cultivator clans like the Wu Family. As for whether other clans and cultivator forces were also under his control, that was unknown.</p><p></p><p>No wonder when Zhou You first met Mu Jihan, Wang Tiezhu kept praising Lin Feng, which made Mu Jihan show displeasure.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Taibai Academy's internal affairs must be in shambles.</p><p></p><p>Previously the Cuiwei Hall and Taibai Residence were stripped by the Wu Family, with a Condensing Qi cultivator temporarily defecting. Now there was the Foundation Building cultivator Master Liu serving the young marquis.</p><p></p><p>Who knew how many spies Linan Prefecture had planted within Taibai Academy?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You shook his head, not dwelling on these thoughts further.  </p><p></p><p>He was not a Taibai disciple, so no need to worry about such matters. Moreover, he was about to reach the eighth level of Qi Refining, not far from Foundation Building.</p><p></p><p>Once he reached Foundation Building, he could leave the Xiao Family behind and soar freely, directly departing from the troubled Lincheng.</p><p></p><p>For now, the urgent task was to overcome the present crisis.</p><p></p><p>He had to permanently trap Mu Jihan and Master Liu here.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, once targeted by them, he would never have a peaceful day and be unable to cultivate in peace.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Minor Shocking Formation was powerful enough - it seemed Mu Jihan and Master Liu had already fallen into the illusion.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he still had the formidable Minor Five Phases Formation at his disposal, which could now unleash its full might.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Master Liu, having removed his mask, stared at "Meng Xun" and said: "Meng Xun, the one standing before you is the young master of Linan Prefecture. Hand Zhou You over to us."</p><p></p><p>"Meng Xun" did not respond to Liu, but instead said disdainfully: "So you're just a lapdog of Taibai Academy."</p><p></p><p>Liu's face darkened, but he did not dare act rashly.</p><p></p><p>He knew Meng Xun's temperament - capricious and bizarre. The other party might not dare harm Mu Jihan, but killing him would simply be killing, without Linan Prefecture doing anything about it.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, Meng Xun had recently reached Condensing Qi, so Liu did not dare provoke him.</p><p></p><p>Liu looked at Mu Jihan and said: "Young Master, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan frowned, staring at "Meng Xun" without a word.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, "Meng Xun" spoke again, looking at Mu Jihan with an eerie smile: "Young Master, I'll give you Zhou You. I hope you'll treat me well in the future."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Remember this lesson well."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he flung the "Zhouyou" in his hand away.</p><p></p><p>The "Zhouyou" flew towards Mu Jihan. </p><p></p><p>"At least you know your place."</p><p></p><p>Liu Shishu gave a cold snort and waved his hand, releasing a powerful force that enveloped the "Zhouyou" and pulled it over.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right!"</p><p></p><p>"Retreat first."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Mu Jihan suddenly spoke up and retreated without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Liu Shishu was stunned for a moment. Just as he was about to retreat as well, he suddenly realized that "Meng Xun" had disappeared, and the "Zhouyou" had turned into a flying sword with a terrifying aura!</p><p></p><p>"An illusion formation!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Shishu instantly understood. The previous scene was all an illusion.</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat shocked. What kind of illusion formation could be so terrifying, so realistic that even he, at the initial Foundation Establishment stage, could be affected by it?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Xiao Yueying really gave such a powerful protective formation to a mere servant?</p><p></p><p>Before Liu Shishu could ponder further, seeing the flying sword coming at him, he quickly retreated.</p><p></p><p>But then he realized that his feet had become incredibly heavy!</p><p></p><p>Looking down, he saw that his legs had been petrified at some point, and he was rooted to the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Petrification Technique! The Minor Five Elements Formation! I'm done for!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Shishu's face changed drastically as he instantly recognized the origin of this formation, but he didn't have time to shout it out.</p><p></p><p>Of course he knew about the Minor Five Elements Formation from the ancient book "Celestial Formations" - after all, he was a lecturer at the Taubai Academy and had the required knowledge.</p><p></p><p>It was just that with his status, he could not obtain the Minor Five Elements Formation.</p><p></p><p>Upon realizing it was the Minor Five Elements Formation, half of Liu Shishu's heart went cold.</p><p></p><p>At this point, it was too late for him to escape or even use a magic weapon to defend himself. All he could do was release a protective force shield.</p><p></p><p>With a "poof" sound, the flying sword instantly shattered Liu Shishu's force shield. Liu Shishu was blown away by the powerful sword aura, his shoulder gashed open and bleeding profusely. He rolled a few times on the ground before managing to stand up.</p><p></p><p>His face had become even paler.</p><p></p><p>It was difficult for him to circulate his internal force!</p><p></p><p>"How could Zhouyou have the Minor Five Elements Formation!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Shishu's scalp went numb as he clutched his shoulder, staring in horror at the dissipated flying sword.</p><p></p><p>That flying sword just now was not a magic weapon, but rather the metal element attack of the Minor Five Elements Formation.</p><p></p><p>The offensive and defensive capabilities of the Minor Five Elements Formation were at the Foundation Establishment level. Someone at the initial Foundation Establishment stage could not withstand it at all.</p><p></p><p>The attack landed on Liu Shishu, so naturally he could not bear it, especially since he was already injured beforehand. The three days' time was only enough to suppress his old injuries, not recover from them.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had suffered this new attack, his old and new injuries erupted together, and he could no longer endure it.</p><p></p><p>"The illusion formation and the Minor Five Elements Formation coexist. We're trapped."</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan, who had originally retreated frantically, looked somewhat troubled as he appeared beside Liu Shishu.</p><p></p><p>He had intended to leave quickly, but unexpectedly ended up reappearing here after retreating.</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan knew that if they could not break through the illusion formation, they would not be able to get out.</p><p></p><p>Liu Shishu took out a pill and swallowed it to first suppress his injuries before speaking. He gritted his teeth and said, "That Zhouyou is merely at the Qi Refining stage. How could he possibly have such a powerful formation? Even if he set it up, with his cultivation, it would be difficult for him to control!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan said in a low voice, "He must have been hiding his true cultivation level."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Liu Shishu felt a bit of lingering fear. It was fortunate that Mu Jihan had come along, otherwise he might have perished here.</p><p></p><p>"Junior BrotherZhou, come out and talk. I mean you no harm; I only wish to cooperate with you and help you break free from servitude."</p><p></p><p>Mu Jihan suddenly spoke in a rather gentle tone.</p><p></p><p>Liu Shishu stood still, silently circulating his internal force to work with the pill he had just taken, rapidly suppressing his injuries.</p><p></p><p>However, Mu Jihan's words received no response.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

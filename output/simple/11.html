        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After returning to the thatched hut, Zhou You routinely caught five spiritual fish. He originally planned to take two spiritual fish out and grill them to eat. </p><p></p><p>During this period, he grilled fish every day.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, since he couldn't find a channel to sell them for the time being, leaving these spiritual fish there would easily cause problems.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Zhou You would grill two spiritual fish to eat every day. </p><p></p><p>One reason was to increase the progress of the "Grilled Fish" skill, and the second was to test whether eating earth-attribute spiritual fish could increase his magic power.</p><p></p><p>However, up until now, Zhou You had eaten nearly twenty spiritual fish, but his magic power had not increased at all. </p><p></p><p>His physical fitness had only strengthened a little.</p><p></p><p>Just as Zhou You was about to catch the fish, Huang Li came over carrying two spiritual fish and a few jars of wine, dismissing Zhou You's idea.</p><p></p><p>Huang Li's mood was obviously not very high, looking displeased all over his face. He said, "Brother Zhou, today let's also taste these spiritual fish that only cultivators can afford, and have a couple of drinks along the way."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't refuse and smiled, "Brother Huang, where did you get these spiritual fish? It's quite extravagant."</p><p></p><p>Huang Li snorted, "Naturally, they were deducted from the main family."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't say much more. He quickly processed the two spiritual fish and then started grilling them outside the hut.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhou, your skills are good. You even grill spiritual fish so fragrantly. Impressive!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Li couldn't help but praise as he smelled the aroma of the grilled fish.</p><p></p><p>In the past ten days or so, Zhou You had grilled about twenty spiritual fish. The progress of the "Grilled Fish" skill had increased to 20, so his grilling skills had naturally become quite proficient, achieving a perfect combination of color, aroma, and flavor.</p><p></p><p>After two bowls of wine, Huang Li took a bite of the grilled fish and began to complain about the young master of the Huo family.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that today was also the day when Huang Li had to hand over spiritual fish. This time, he only handed over eighty-one spiritual fish, and ten spiritual fish were deducted.</p><p></p><p>As a result, he was scolded by the young master of the Huo family and not only did he not receive any spirit sand as a reward, but he was also whipped a few times.</p><p></p><p>This made Huang Li feel extremely aggrieved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>His resentment towards the young master of the Huo family grew heavier and heavier.</p><p></p><p>"This Huo Yunhao is just a landlord! Damn it! I've been diligent for many years, handing over so many spiritual fish to him, and I've never caused him any trouble. Now, just because I deducted ten spiritual fish, he treats me like this!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Li took a big gulp of wine and continued to curse, "Who the hell doesn't know that their task at the Taibai Academy is to hand over only eighty spiritual fish? If this continues, I'm not doing it anymore!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You remained silent after listening.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, as Huang Li said, the disciples of the Taibai Academy only needed to hand over eighty spiritual fish every month to complete the task.</p><p></p><p>But all the scions of prestigious families seemed to have agreed to demand that each of their subordinate fish workers must hand over one hundred spiritual fish every month.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhou, don't you have any grievances?"</p><p></p><p>Huang Li looked at Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was silent for a moment, then smiled bitterly, "Who can't see through the fact that we're being exploited? But what can we do about it?"</p><p></p><p>Of course, he only said this on the surface. Zhou You had the golden seal, and it was only a matter of time before he achieved the Foundation Establishment stage and broke free from the Xiao family.</p><p></p><p>Huang Li's hand holding the wine bowl trembled slightly. After a moment of silence, he drained the bowl and said in a low voice, "Brother Zhou, I heard that the Righteous Sect Alliance has been recruiting scattered cultivators again recently..."</p><p></p><p>Huang Li didn't finish his sentence, but stared intently at Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked surprised upon hearing this, "Brother Huang, what do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>Huang Li looked around, then said, "What I mean is, follow Brother Zhao's path, leave this place, and join the Righteous Sect Alliance!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You said, "But we have slave registrations. Even if we join the Righteous Sect Alliance, it won't be of any use."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Huang Li said with firm determination, "Rest assured, I have made inquiries. The Zhengqi Alliance is now powerful. Even those cultivating clans dare not provoke them. As long as we join the Zhengqi Alliance, the Xiao and Huo families will not dare to say anything."</p><p></p><p>Pausing for a moment, Huang Li continued, "Brother Zhou, have you forgotten about Zhao Bin? After he escaped, he joined the Zhengqi Alliance. Even Xiao Yuying could do nothing to him!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a hint of interest appeared on Zhou You's face, but his heart remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhou You's expression, Huang Li quickly struck while the iron was hot, "I heard that by joining the Zhengqi Alliance, one can receive five spirit stones every month. This treatment is no worse than even the prestigious orthodox sects!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked surprised, and this time it was genuine.</p><p></p><p>Five spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>For fish-servants like them, this was already an extremely good treatment!</p><p></p><p>One must know that even for someone like Huang Li, who had ten spirit fish deducted every month, it would take him a month to accumulate twenty spirit sand, and five months to gather one spirit stone!</p><p></p><p>Five spirit stones would require a fish-servant twenty-five months, over two years!</p><p></p><p>The Zhengqi Alliance was so generous?</p><p></p><p>No wonder it was embraced by so many wandering cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Zhou You remained unmoved, as he had the Golden Seal, so he had no need to join any force.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhou, I have a friend in the Zhengqi Alliance who serves as an executor. If we go there, we can directly join the Zhengqi Alliance and enjoy the treatment of top-tier allies. Not only will we receive five spirit stones every month, but we will also have the opportunity to select a cultivation technique!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Li persuaded him patiently, his tone filled with longing for the future, "Can you imagine? If we join the Zhengqi Alliance, we will have vast prospects ahead. Those cultivation techniques that were once out of reach will be within our grasp! Staying here, we will never have the chance to step into the Foundation Establishment realm in our entire lives!"</p><p></p><p>Pausing for a moment, Huang Li added, "To be honest, it's because we've been getting along so well lately that I'm telling you about this good opportunity. Otherwise, I would never have mentioned it to you. Fellow Daoist Qin from the Lu Family has already agreed to go with us. From then on, we will travel together, which will be helpful on the path of cultivation."</p><p></p><p>After Huang Li's lengthy speech, Zhou You's gaze showed some interest, though of course, this was just an act.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't show any interest at all, it would arouse suspicion.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You pondered carefully.</p><p></p><p>Spirit stones and cultivation techniques were exactly what he needed most.</p><p></p><p>With the Golden Seal, as long as he cultivated, he would eventually achieve perfection and increase his cultivation base, no matter which technique he practiced.</p><p></p><p>As for spirit stones, he could use them to purchase cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>The treatment offered by the Zhengqi Alliance did indeed far exceed Zhou You's expectations.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You knew well that there was no such thing as a free lunch.</p><p></p><p>Recalling Huang Li's various behaviors since they had been in contact, Zhou You felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p></p><p>There was definitely a trap!</p><p></p><p>Absolutely a trap!</p><p></p><p>If the Zhengqi Alliance was truly so good, why would Huang Li bother persuading him so painstakingly here? Wouldn't it be better to simply sell the opportunity and make a tidy profit?</p><p></p><p>It's better to be safe than sorry.</p><p></p><p>What Zhou You wanted was a legitimate way to remove his servant status, not to escape.</p><p></p><p>With the assistance of the "Simplicity of the Great Way" Golden Seal, as long as Zhou You cultivated steadily, he had a great chance of reaching the Foundation Establishment realm and easily removing his servant status.</p><p></p><p>Since this was the case, Zhou You had no need to take such a risk.</p><p></p><p>Since there was a reliable path, why would he choose one filled with uncertainty?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had determined these things from the very beginning, so no matter how fanciful Huang Li's words were, his heart remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>Though the path is long, by walking, one will eventually arrive.</p><p></p><p>Though the task is difficult, by doing it, one will surely succeed.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

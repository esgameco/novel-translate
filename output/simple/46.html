        <h1>Chapter 46</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Ever since Zhou You left the town, he felt like he was being watched. </p><p></p><p>His spiritual sense strength had already reached 110 zhang, stronger than an ordinary eighth level of Qi refining cultivator. Combined with his keen six senses, he was very sensitive to these things.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, after more than an hour, his spiritual sense detected the other party - there were indeed people following him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Zhou You had seen these few people before!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You never expected that despite being so careful and cautious, he would still be targeted.</p><p></p><p>He felt speechless about it. </p><p></p><p>Could it be that he had exposed himself somewhere?</p><p></p><p>For now, he didn't dwell on that. Zhou You acted with great skill, swiftly setting up the Minor Shocking Formation, then burying a few ground explosion talismans on the ground, before hiding in the bushes.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, three people dressed in black clothes and wearing masks came dashing through the trees, quickly arriving in this area. </p><p></p><p>The three jumped down from the trees, each with a different build.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Fang, it seems that person has hidden in this mountain valley," said a slightly thin cultivator. His voice was that of the Taibai Academy disciple with a horse-face who had complained about the fish tax when Zhou You was gathering information at the restaurant!</p><p></p><p>The one in the middle had an upright stature and an excellent physique outline, clearly the strongest at the seventh level of Qi refining - Senior Martial Brother Fang.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Fang nodded, "Correct, I just scanned with my spiritual sense, there's no other exit in the valley, he must be hiding inside."</p><p></p><p>The horse-faced youth said, "Senior Martial Brother, he's just a fifth level Qi refining Artifact Refinement cultivator, there's no need for us to be so cautious. Let me handle him alone later."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he took off his mask, revealing a horse-like face in this mountain valley.</p><p></p><p>A hint of displeasure flashed across Senior Brother Fang's eyes, but he didn't say anything and also took off his mask, revealing a handsome face.</p><p></p><p>As for the third person, he also removed his mask. It was the servant-like person who had stopped Zhou You the first time he went to Taibai Town.</p><p></p><p>These three were actually mixed up together, with some unknown connection.</p><p></p><p>"This person's method of forging that high-quality spirit artifact is unique, definitely the work of no ordinary Artifact Refinement cultivator. He's the type of talent we urgently need, so we must invite him back no matter what," Senior Brother Fang calmly said, though the word "invite" carried a hint of killing intent.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the servant spoke up, "Young Master, the underground trade meeting is approaching soon. The Second Young Master sent word that they've found the Pill Refinement cultivators, only the Artifact Refinement cultivator is left."</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Fang let out a cold snort, "Shut up, don't mention him in front of me! Father will eventually welcome me back into the clan, not him!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he cupped his fist towards the valley and said indifferently, "Dear Daoist friend, I am Fang, here to invite you to tonight's underground trade meeting. I hope you can give me face."</p><p></p><p>His tone seemed light, yet carried a sense of arrogance, as if inviting Zhou You was an honor for Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no reaction at all from the valley.</p><p></p><p>The horse-faced youth coldly snorted, "Giving face to the shameless, I'll make him beg for his life when I take him back."</p><p></p><p>With that, the horse-faced youth headed straight into the valley.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go in together," Senior Brother Fang's expression turned grim as he led the servant and horse-faced youth into the valley, clearly afraid something unexpected might happen.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhou You was hiding behind a rock, listening to the conversation between Senior Brother Fang and the others. He couldn't help but ponder quietly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems there's something fishy about this underground trade meeting."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You thought to himself, "Could it be that even Taibai Academy is not clean?"</p><p></p><p>Taibai Academy was an official cultivating force under the Great Qi Imperial Court, so normally they wouldn't do shady underground dealings.</p><p></p><p>But from Senior Brother Fang and the others' words, this underground trade meeting gathered all kinds of cultivators like Pill Refiners, Artifact Refiners, Talisman Masters, Formation Masters and more. Moreover, it seemed to be...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It was done in the form of a kidnapping. </p><p></p><p>Anyone could see that something was off.</p><p></p><p>They were afraid that once they went to the underground transaction gathering, they wouldn't be able to get out.</p><p></p><p>And this underground transaction gathering was organized by Taibai Alley and Senior Martial Brother Fang.</p><p></p><p>After careful thought, Zhou You realized that if there was a problem with Taibai Academy, there was no need to resort to such despicable means, and even request some qi-cultivating refining masters. It would be like a handsome and wealthy young master going to great lengths to pursue an ugly and lowly woman - it made no sense.</p><p></p><p>So this matter was most likely Senior Martial Brother Fang and others borrowing Taibai Alley's assistance to do something unsavory.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Senior Martial Brother Fang, the youth with a horse-face, and another person entered the mountain valley. Fang sent out his divine sense to quickly locate Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a figure flashed within the valley. </p><p></p><p>A slender figure in white robes walked out from inside.</p><p></p><p>"Someone from Taibai Academy?"</p><p></p><p>The horse-faced youth was stunned. "Senior Martial Brother Fang, could it be that the refining master from earlier was from the academy? If so, this is troublesome!"</p><p></p><p>Fang frowned, and just as he was about to speak, the figure walked through the woods and came out.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Sister Bai?"</p><p></p><p>The horse-faced youth and Fang exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>The person who walked out from the woods was none other than the graceful and icy-faced Bai Chiyu, clad in a white Daoist robe!</p><p></p><p>Fang and the other never expected Bai Chiyu to be in the mountain valley. What was going on?</p><p></p><p>Fang put on a genial smile and took a few steps forward. "Junior Martial Sister Bai, what are you doing here? My junior martial brother and I were patrolling..."</p><p></p><p>"Puh--"</p><p></p><p>"Wu Yong! What are you doing? How dare you sneak attack me!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the horse-faced youth cried out in alarm, stumbling forward a few steps while clutching his chest and glaring at the young servant behind him with fury in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The young servant Wu Yong controlled his flying sword and angrily shouted, "Young Master, quickly leave! This Ma Jie is an imposter!"</p><p></p><p>The horse-faced youth cursed, "You're talking nonsense! I've been by Senior Martial Brother Fang's side for years, how dare you slander me! I'll kill you!"</p><p></p><p>The horse-faced youth was so enraged his face turned pale, and with the wound on his chest from the sword strike, he coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood in his anger.</p><p></p><p>Fang's expression changed, and he quickly put some distance between himself and the horse-faced youth.</p><p></p><p>"What is going on here?"</p><p></p><p>Fang's face darkened as he felt flustered, unable to make sense of the situation for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, hurry and leave! Ma Jie is from Taibai Academy, he wants to uproot us all!" </p><p></p><p>Wu Yong spoke urgently again, this time controlling his flying sword to form a red light that instantly charged towards Fang.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother, did you see? Wu Yong is the traitor!" the horse-faced youth shrieked.</p><p></p><p>Fang's face twitched, and he immediately made a hand seal, taking out a shield to block Wu Yong's flying sword.</p><p></p><p>"It's an illusion technique!"</p><p></p><p>"That person is using an illusion technique!"</p><p></p><p>Fang immediately understood, angrily shouting, "Wu Yong! What you're seeing are illusions! Snap out of it!"</p><p></p><p>His shout was even mixed with divine sense power in an attempt to shake Wu Yong out of it.</p><p></p><p>But Wu Yong remained undeterred, continuing his attacks.</p><p></p><p>Fang was both shocked and enraged. While fending off Wu Yong's attacks, he managed to take out a first-grade superior talisman - a Dispel Illusion Talisman!</p><p></p><p>"Open!"</p><p></p><p>With Fang's shout, the Dispel Illusion Talisman self-ignited into ashes, and the surrounding environment immediately changed.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>Fang's eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

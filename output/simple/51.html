        <h1>Chapter 51</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, with Taibai Academy and Lin Feng taking the blame for Zhou You, Zhou You could cultivate in peace and strive to advance his cultivation to the Foundation Establishment stage as soon as possible. </p><p></p><p>After all, with the golden imprint of "The Way of Simplicity", as long as he had time, he could cultivate to the Foundation Establishment, Core Formation, or even the Nascent Soul stage!</p><p></p><p>More than ten days later...</p><p></p><p>"Poof--" </p><p></p><p>Zhou You raised his palm, and a wisp of pale green flames appeared in his palm. The flames were not large, only about the size of two combined fingers, flickering lightly, emanating waves of life force. But its temperature was extremely high, with tendrils of high heat rising around it.</p><p></p><p>These flames were called the "Green Primordial Spiritual Flames", a type of spiritual fire from the pill cultivation inheritance in Wu Yong's storage bag.  </p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, whether a pill cultivator or an artifact refiner, one would master a fire-type spell. Otherwise, they could only rely on fire-type materials or earth fires for pill refining and artifact forging.</p><p></p><p>Among the pill cultivation inheritance Zhou You obtained, besides the pill refining experience and some pill formulas, the most precious was the cultivation method for these "Green Primordial Spiritual Flames."</p><p></p><p>The Green Primordial Spiritual Flames were almost tailor-made for pill refining. After cultivating them, the wood-attributed power within was relatively mild, which could increase the success rate of pill refining to a certain extent, especially during the pill condensation stage where the success rate was even higher.</p><p></p><p>However, such a small wisp of Green Primordial Spiritual Flames was not enough for pill refining. First, the temperature was insufficient, and second, the size was too small - it could not refine multiple spirit herbs simultaneously.  </p><p></p><p>So, to refine pills, Zhou You still needed to further expand the volume of the Green Primordial Spiritual Flames and enhance their quality.</p><p></p><p>[Green Primordial Spiritual Flames (1/100): A rather peculiar type of spiritual flames. Practice daily, and you will eventually succeed.]</p><p></p><p>Golden light flickered in his sea of consciousness, and a line of text appeared on the golden imprint.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You only glanced at it and paid no further attention. To refine pills, he had to advance the "Green Primordial Spiritual Flames" to perfection first.</p><p></p><p>Once these flames reached perfection, not only would they aid in pill refining, but they would also be extremely useful in battle. Even now, at this rudimentary stage, their might already surpassed the Flame Bolt spell.  He could hardly imagine their power once perfected.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked forward to it.</p><p></p><p>"Sizzle--"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Green Primordial Spiritual Flames dissipated automatically, and Zhou You sighed. Although formidable, the Green Primordial Spiritual Flames consumed a tremendous amount of spiritual power. Just that brief moment had drained one-tenth of Zhou You's spiritual power reserves.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, with Zhou You's current spiritual power, it was impossible for him to continuously use the Green Primordial Spiritual Flames for pill refining. At the very least, he would need to reach the seventh level of Qi Condensation first.</p><p></p><p>He still needed to work harder!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You continued practicing with the Green Primordial Spiritual Flames. After ten attempts, his spiritual power was depleted, and his consciousness sank as his progress did not increase at all.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You did not get discouraged. Instead, he sat cross-legged and recovered his spiritual power. </p><p></p><p>Thus, Zhou You spent the entire afternoon practicing, recovering spiritual power, and practicing again. In just that afternoon, he used the Green Primordial Spiritual Flames over a hundred times, yet the progress value remained at 1.</p><p></p><p>However, the more difficult it was, the more Zhou You looked forward to it. The harder it was to cultivate the Green Primordial Spiritual Flames, the greater their potential.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was naturally delighted. Besides, the spirit herbs had not fully grown yet, so there was no urgency for pill refining at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You stood up, dusted off his clothes, and went to the herb field to check on the newly planted spirit herb seeds and water them.</p><p></p><p>It had been half a month since Zhou You returned from the market town. His [Planting] progress had successfully reached 7 points. He clearly felt that his ability to catalyze the growth of spirit herbs had increased again, though not yet reaching a quarter of its full potential.</p><p></p><p>Once perfected, his catalyzing ability would undoubtedly be terrifying.</p><p></p><p>After watering the spirit herbs, Zhou You went to the shore of Erhai Lake and took out two first-grade spirit fish, green wood fish, from his fish pouch. He returned home and began cooking them.</p><p></p><p>Ever since returning, Zhou You had been fishing for spirit fish every day, catching enough for eight days' worth of meals.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After fifteen low-grade spirit fish, he then caught all first-grade mid-grade spirit fish.  </p><p></p><p>And not long after, Jinyinlu recorded a first-grade mid-grade spirit fish.</p><p></p><p>[Fishing for Spirit Fishãƒ»First-Grade Mid-Grade (2/100): A rather profound study, fishing daily will eventually lead to success.]</p><p></p><p>Half a month's time, the progress of this first-grade mid-grade spirit fish had only increased by 2 points.</p><p></p><p>This shows its difficulty.  </p><p></p><p>Of course, Zhou You was not discouraged.</p><p></p><p>The more difficult it was, the more he looked forward to it.</p><p></p><p>The harder a skill was to reach full proficiency, the greater the bonus upon completion.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You quickly processed the greenwood fish, then took it home and began cooking.</p><p></p><p>During this period, he almost ate greenwood fish every day.</p><p></p><p>Because he found that eating greenwood fish could actually increase his cultivation speed.</p><p></p><p>Originally it took six days of cultivation to increase the progress of the "Vein Opening Manual" by one point, but if he persisted in eating greenwood fish every day, it would only take five days to increase by one point.</p><p></p><p>It doesn't seem like much, but it could shorten Zhou You's time considerably.</p><p></p><p>Originally, to cultivate the middle section of the "Vein Opening Manual" to the perfect realm would take 360 days, but if he persisted in using greenwood fish every day, it could be shortened to 300 days!</p><p></p><p>That's a full two months less of cultivation time!</p><p></p><p>Of course, the premise was that Zhou You could persist in eating greenwood fish every day.</p><p></p><p>Eating it every day...he might get sick of the sight of fish later on.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Zhou You cooked two greenwood fish.</p><p></p><p>One steamed, one braised.  </p><p></p><p>Fragrant and the meat tender.</p><p></p><p>But to Zhou You, it was like chewing wax in his mouth, no feeling.</p><p></p><p>[Cooking (2/100): An extremely profound study, practicing daily will eventually lead to success.]</p><p></p><p>At this time, the golden light in his consciousness flashed, and another line of text appeared.</p><p></p><p>Another profound-level skill.</p><p></p><p>This was a skill Zhou You had recorded during this period.</p><p></p><p>Previously when he cooked low-grade spirit fish, he did not record this skill. It was not until recently when he started cooking first-grade mid-grade spirit fish that he finally recorded it.</p><p></p><p>It seems that this skill, which appears to be a simple life skill, actually requires the cooked ingredients to reach a certain level before it can be recorded and its progress increased.</p><p></p><p>After eating, Zhou You cleaned up, then went to the back of the house to start chopping firewood.  </p><p></p><p>Because he found that [Logging] did not necessarily mean chopping down trees, chopping the logs he brought back could also increase progress to a certain degree. However, it also required a lot of time spent chopping to increase the number of chops and increase progress.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You, now at the fifth level of Body Tempering, had considerable strength. After swinging his axe to chop all the firewood in the backyard, he stopped.</p><p></p><p>And at this time, the progress of [Logging] also increased by 1 point.</p><p></p><p>[Logging (16/100): A rather profound study, practicing daily will eventually lead to success.]</p><p></p><p>At 16 points, this was the skill with the highest progress among Zhou You's profound-level life skills.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You glanced at Jinyin, threw the axe under the eaves, and then returned to the house.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the moon was bright and the stars were sparse, the cold wind blowing bleakly.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You returned to the wooden house, lit the firewood inside, and the whole wooden house became bright and gradually warmed up, shining brightly in the darkness.  </p><p></p><p>He sat cross-legged, meditated and exhaled for a moment, and the bones in his body began to crackle.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Zhou You's face suddenly turned pale, and beads of sweat the size of beans rolled down.</p><p></p><p>A wave of heart-wrenching pain surged like a tsunami.  </p><p></p><p>Zhou You's flesh all over his body seemed to be surging, those bones as if being frantically pounded and squeezed by some force.</p><p></p><p>The pain made Zhou You's whole body tremble, and muffled groans occasionally came from his throat...</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Walking along the path in the inner courtyard, Zhou You kept his eyes straight ahead, closely following behind Xiao Qing. Midway, he found an opportunity to ask Xiao Qing, "What does the young lady want with me?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing shook his head, indicating he was unsure, but said with certainty, "Brother You, you don't need to worry. The young lady has been very satisfied with your performance recently. Her summoning you to the inner courtyard definitely isn't anything bad!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Xiao Qing's words, Zhou You's heart settled slightly, but he did not completely relax.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Xiao Qing led Zhou You to the inner courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The inner courtyard was obviously much more vibrant than the outer courtyard, with exotic flowers blooming, fragrant medicinal herbs permeating the air, and a deep tranquility that delighted the heart and mind.</p><p></p><p>"Such a rich spiritual energy!" Zhou You couldn't help but inwardly remark.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating in a place with such abundant spiritual energy would undoubtedly accelerate one's cultivation speed considerably.</p><p></p><p>They arrived at the door to Xiao Yue Ying's room. Xiao Qing told Zhou You to wait three zhang (about 10 meters) away, while she went to the door and gently knocked.</p><p></p><p>"Young lady, I've brought him," Xiao Qing respectfully said.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Xiao Yue Ying's slightly chilly voice came from inside, "Bring him in."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing was stunned for a moment, somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Generally, it was already extremely rare for a male servant to be allowed into the inner courtyard, yet Xiao Yue Ying actually permitted Zhou You to enter her boudoir!</p><p></p><p>This... completely violated the rules!</p><p></p><p>If word of this got out, it would undoubtedly give rise to unsavory rumors.</p><p></p><p>However, Xiao Qing could not defy Xiao Yue Ying's decision, so she acknowledged it, gently pushed open the door, and gestured for Zhou You to enter.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was equally perplexed and became even more guarded inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Just what did this young lady intend to do?</p><p></p><p>It should be known that in great clans, the rules and proprieties were strict and numerous.</p><p></p><p>For a great young lady like Xiao Yue Ying, she would rarely come into contact with other men. Inviting a man into the inner courtyard already violated the rules, let alone inviting a man into her boudoir.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You remained silent for a moment but still stepped into the room.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering, a faint fragrance wafted over him.</p><p></p><p>Catching a whiff of this scent, Zhou You felt his entire being calm down.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You stood before the screen, vaguely able to make out a slender silhouette sitting cross-legged on the other side.</p><p></p><p>"Young lady," Zhou You cupped his hands in salutation.</p><p></p><p>"Close the door and come over here," Xiao Yue Ying's chilly voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You hesitated briefly but closed the door and walked around the screen into the room.</p><p></p><p>The simply furnished ancient-style room had no bed. Apart from some hanging landscape paintings, there were no other special furnishings.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yue Ying sat cross-legged on a meditation mat in the center, scrutinizing Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>When Zhou You saw Xiao Yue Ying, he was also inwardly stunned by her beauty.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yue Ying truly deserved to be called the Celestial Lady of the Moon. She was indeed a beauty that could destroy nations and cities.</p><p></p><p>At twenty-five or twenty-six years old, the prime of a cultivator's life, Xiao Yue Ying wore a green gossamer robe and a dress with a hundred pleats like mist over green grass. A sheer green gauze veil draped over her shoulders, her waist as slender as a carved jade, her skin as smooth as congealed jade, and an air as fresh as an orchid. She embodied the full bloom of this age to perfection.</p><p></p><p>"Sit," Xiao Yue Ying extended a slender jade-like finger, pointing to the side.</p><p></p><p>It was only then that Zhou You noticed there was another meditation mat beside hers.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Zhou You did not refuse and sat cross-legged on the mat.</p><p></p><p>"You need not be so restrained. Now that you have embarked on the path of cultivation, you are a fellow cultivator. We can address each other as fellow daoists," Xiao Yue Ying calmly said.</p><p></p><p>As soon as she finished speaking, Zhou You felt a powerful spiritual sense sweep over his body - it was at least at the Foundation Establishment realm!</p><p></p><p>It was clear that Xiao Yue Ying was probing his cultivation base!</p><p></p><p>If...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It's not that he had reached the third level of Qi cultivation, with his spiritual sense reaching the sixth level, otherwise he probably wouldn't have detected Xiao Yueying's probing at all. </p><p></p><p>However, that spiritual sense quickly retreated.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You breathed a sigh of relief, it seemed Xiao Yueying had not noticed anything amiss. </p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had previously cultivated the Qi-Condensing Art to perfection, otherwise he would have definitely been exposed!</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Miss."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You pretended to know nothing, cupping his hands in greeting. His form of address did not change either, since she had simply said it that way, so he could naturally also address Xiao Yueying as "Daoyou" (fellow cultivator).</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You could now face Xiao Yueying without being overly humble or arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yueying could sense this change, but she did not mind.</p><p></p><p>"Daoyou Zhou, I did not expect your talent in fishing spirit fish to be so outstanding. Even though you have just started cultivating, you can hand over ninety spirit fish every month, truly impressing me."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yueying's beautiful eyes flashed with a hint of praise.</p><p></p><p>The Taibai Academy's requirement was to submit eighty spirit fish per month, but when she initially said "you must hand over a hundred spirit fish every month", it was just to put pressure on Zhou You and spur him on.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Xiao Yueying did not think Zhou You could complete the task smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Zhou You completed the quota in the first month, and was able to complete the task in full for every subsequent month, even exceeding it at times.</p><p></p><p>This gave her quite a bit of face among the scions of aristocratic families.</p><p></p><p>Plus, Zhou You had a wood spirit root, so in the future he might be able to help her breakthrough to the Pill Condensation realm, so Xiao Yueying was in a good mood and treated Zhou You with more care.</p><p></p><p>When Zhou You heard Xiao Yueying's words, he felt a bit speechless inwardly.</p><p></p><p>He had already been holding back on giving her spirit fish, but it still caught her attention.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I still need to be more low-key and cautious!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You thought inwardly, but outwardly he said, "When I was young, my family was poor and we had no rice to cook. I often went to the riverside to fish to stave off hunger, so I have some experience in angling."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yueying nodded slightly, her bright eyes saying, "Recently I've been refining a spirit pill that requires a first-grade mid-spiritual fish called the Qingmu Fish. If you can catch some, you can exchange them with me for some spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>"Qingmu Fish?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You secretly memorized the name of this fish, it seemed to be the pale blue first-grade mid-spiritual fish he had caught before.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yueying gave an "mm" sound, "This fish is pale blue in color, shaped like a carp, and is quite difficult to catch by angling."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You acknowledged it, not mentioning that he had already caught this type of spirit fish before, instead just saying he would try his best.</p><p></p><p>In terms of angling for spirit fish, he had already made a bit of a name for himself in front of Xiao Yueying. He could not show off further, otherwise as just a fishing servant being so outstanding would seem questionable.</p><p></p><p>"This is a token from the Taibai Academy. You can attend the public lectures held once a month at the academy. Although there are no profound principles taught, they are still greatly beneficial for Qi cultivation cultivators. Attending may help with your vein opening."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yueying handed Zhou You a jade pendant and instructed him.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was a bit surprised, hesitating before accepting the jade pendant, "Thank you, Miss."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yueying nodded and did not say anything more, letting Zhou You leave the room.</p><p></p><p>After leaving, Zhou You looked down at the white jade pendant, even able to sense Xiao Yueying's lingering warmth and a faint fragrance on it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was a bit confused about Xiao Yueying's intentions.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he had overthought things?</p><p></p><p>Was Xiao Yueying simply trying to help him improve his cultivation, to add strength for her Xiao family?</p><p></p><p>But why would she care about him, just a servant?</p><p></p><p>It didn't make sense!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You gripped the jade pendant, deciding to still remain on guard.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 56</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Has the Taibai Academy issued another bounty list for slaying demonic beasts?</p><p></p><p>Zhou You glanced at Bai Chi Yu and saw her big eyes staring at him expectantly, obviously wanting Zhou You to come up with a plan for how she could kill more demonic beasts and get on the list. </p><p></p><p>However, this time Zhou You did not offer her any strategies.</p><p></p><p>The previous time was because Bai Chi Yu had indeed helped him a lot, even later helping him copy four formations from the "Ancient Celestial Formations", three of which were at the Foundation Establishment level.</p><p></p><p>The Little Shocking Spirit Formation had also helped Zhou You a great deal, allowing him to deal with enemies much more easily.</p><p></p><p>Plus, Zhou You himself disliked those people from the Righteous Alliance, so using Bai Chi Yu's hand to eliminate some Righteous Alliance cultivators was quite satisfying.</p><p></p><p>That's why Zhou You had helped Bai Chi Yu come up with that plan before.</p><p></p><p>But for this new demonic beast bounty list, Zhou You restrained his inner urge.</p><p></p><p>This kind of thing was very dangerous.</p><p></p><p>If Bai Chi Yu took first place on the demonic beast bounty list again, it would increase the risk of Zhou You being exposed.</p><p></p><p>Although Zhou You only played the role of strategist, even if exposed it wouldn't be that big of a deal, but Zhou You didn't want to stand out.</p><p></p><p>So Zhou You pretended not to see Bai Chi Yu's gaze.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he casually said, "The Taibai Academy has set up a demonic beast bounty list, it seems the situation inside the border is not optimistic. The entire Lin City area must have quite a few demonic beasts appearing."</p><p></p><p>The news Bai Chi Yu brought did reveal this hidden danger.</p><p></p><p>If only a few demonic beasts appeared inside the border, the Taibai Academy would have no need to set up a bounty list.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of this bounty list indirectly shows that the current situation is severe.</p><p></p><p>Bai Chi Yu nodded, "Yes, but I heard from my master that the ones appearing now are just first-grade demonic beasts, nothing to be afraid of."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You made an "oh" sound, then shifted the topic to the Righteous Alliance, asking, "Actually I have one question. The Taibai Academy has Nascent Soul Patriarchs, so why are they still allowing the Righteous Alliance to be so rampant?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Chi Yu shook her head, "The Nascent Soul Patriarchs left the academy long ago."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was stunned for a moment. No wonder the Righteous Alliance dared to be so brazen, provoking the Taibai Academy, even raiding it ten months ago.</p><p></p><p>It turned out the Nascent Soul Patriarchs were not at the academy.</p><p></p><p>But this girl Bai Chi Yu was too direct, unhesitatingly telling him such important information. Wasn't she afraid he might be a spy from the Righteous Alliance or other forces?</p><p></p><p>"You just tell me such important things like that?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You asked.</p><p></p><p>A confused look appeared on Bai Chi Yu's little face, "Is there a problem?"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You didn't say anything more. He walked over to continue chopping wood. But before Bai Chi Yu left, Zhou You advised her that if she slew any demonic beasts, he hoped she could skin them and sell the hides to him, as he was willing to purchase them at market price.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>That night, Zhou You emptied out everything Bai Chi Yu had given him.</p><p></p><p>At first, Zhou You hadn't paid it much attention, because in his view, although the rewards for first place on the bounty list were bountiful, with his current talisman-making abilities, given enough time he could still earn it all back.</p><p></p><p>But after scanning it with his divine sense, he found the storage bag was stuffed full, containing a vast array of items.</p><p></p><p>From first-grade spirit pills all the way up to second-grade pills!</p><p></p><p>Talismans, formation flags, alchemy furnaces, magical artifacts - you name it, it had it!</p><p></p><p>Zhou You roughly estimated that the contents of this single storage bag were worth at least...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"...at least worth seven or eight thousand low-grade spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>"This girl has evenly distributed all the spoils of war from the cultivators of the Righteous Aura Alliance that were killed." </p><p></p><p>Zhou You was dumbstruck and laughed wryly, finally understanding what Bai Chi Yu meant by "evenly distributed."</p><p></p><p>So Zhou You took the opportunity to go to the market again, selling off all the things he couldn't use, only keeping a refining furnace and some pill refining tools and magic treasures. </p><p></p><p>Mainly because the sword-shaped magic treasures and blade-type magic treasures could have their quality improved through "polishing."</p><p></p><p>After selling those things and exchanging for over seven thousand spirit stones, Zhou You kept a few hundred spirit stones to power formations, and used the rest to purchase what he needed.</p><p></p><p>For example, the array flags needed to refine the Minor Shocking Soul Array - he wanted to try enhancing its power to affect the early Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>He also restocked materials for the Minor Five Phases Array and the Five Fiends Killing Array, so when refining array flags, he'd have more margin for error.</p><p></p><p>He also bought the 'Jade Yuan Body Refining' manual, a body cultivation technique for the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>Once he completed the 'Tempering Bones Technique', he could start practicing the 'Jade Yuan Body Refining' technique.  </p><p></p><p>In addition, after careful consideration, Zhou You spent 500 spirit stones to buy a high-grade wood-attribute technique called 'Evergreen Skill'.</p><p></p><p>The 'Evergreen Skill' was the most orthodox wood-attribute technique. Cultivating the wood-attribute spiritual root could increase cultivation speed to some extent, make one's spiritual power more enduring, and provide a certain longevity bonus.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Zhou You thought that since he had the 'Way of Simplicity' golden imprint, cultivating any technique didn't matter - even the 'Opening the Meridians Technique' could reach the ninth level of Qi Condensation, so there was no need to waste spirit stones buying Qi Condensation stage techniques.</p><p></p><p>But with the recent turmoil in Lincheng, he wanted to reach the Foundation Establishment stage as soon as possible.  </p><p></p><p>So he stopped being so frugal with spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Since the 'Evergreen Skill' could increase his cultivation speed, Zhou You just bought it directly.</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining spirit stones, apart from leaving a few hundred to maintain formations, he used the rest to purchase pills that would aid his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He bought twenty Natal Essence Pills for use in the later Qi Condensation stage, and twenty Earth Essence Pills for the early Qi Condensation stage.</p><p></p><p>This cost nearly two thousand spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>After returning to the wooden hut, Zhou You began cross-cultivating the 'Evergreen Skill', taking a month to successfully integrate it.</p><p></p><p>But the effects were immediately visible.</p><p></p><p>The latter part of the 'Opening the Meridians Technique' required one month of cultivation to increase progress by one point, while the 'Evergreen Skill' only needed twenty days, increasing the cultivation speed by one-third.  </p><p></p><p>According to Zhou You's estimation, he needed 20 points of progress to reach the seventh level of Qi Condensation.</p><p></p><p>Without using pills, cultivating the 'Opening the Meridians Technique' would take 600 days, while the 'Evergreen Skill' would only take 400 days!</p><p></p><p>A significant increase in cultivation speed.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention Zhou You also had cultivation pills to aid him. Although the Natal Essence Pills for the middle Qi Condensation stage had some drug resistance and reduced effectiveness, they still had a certain effect.</p><p></p><p>Around the time Zhou You cross-cultivated the 'Evergreen Skill', his 'Chop' technique also finally reached completion!</p><p></p><p>With 'Chop' reaching completion, golden light flashed in Zhou You's sea of consciousness, powerful golden light bathing his physical body.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the bonus from 'Chop' was not related to spiritual sense, but to the physical body.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's physical body realm broke through to the seventh level of Body Tempering!</p><p></p><p>Immense power infused Zhou You's entire body, and he felt his physical strength was many times stronger than before!</p><p></p><p>That was the transition from the middle to the late stage of Body Tempering, so the enhancement was naturally multiplied.</p><p></p><p>But apart from his powerful body, what delighted Zhou You the most was that 'Chop' had brought him his second special trait!</p><p></p><p>The Fiend Slaying trait!</p><p></p><p>Dear readers, please read daily, thank you for your support!

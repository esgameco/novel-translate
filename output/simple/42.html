        <h1>Chapter 42</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Not long after Zhang Lei and others left, Xiao Qing also came riding on a white jade dragon horse. </p><p></p><p>Seeing that Zhou You was safe and unharmed, Xiao Qing finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>However, since the last incident, Xiao Qing seemed a bit unnatural when facing Zhou You.</p><p></p><p>After confirming Zhou You was okay, Xiao Qing said "The young lady is preparing for the Academy Competition and cannot come in person," then rode away on the white jade dragon horse to report Zhou You's current situation to Xiao Yue Ying.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You did not try to stop him, watching Xiao Qing's departing back, and started to get busy again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Taibai Academy lasted only ten days, and after ten days the competition came to a close. </p><p></p><p>The sword lights in the sky gradually became sparse, and those Taibai Academy disciples fell silent.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the matter of the Fish Servant Hut had passed like this, and no one came to Zhou You's place again.</p><p></p><p>Since the Fish Servant Hut had an incident, no one dared to live there anymore, and even some timid fish servants did not dare to stay in that area.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had not gone to the Fish Servant Hut for a long time, so he was not very aware of what had happened outside.</p><p></p><p>The weather became increasingly cold, and there were hardly any leaves left on the trees.</p><p></p><p>Twenty-one days had passed since the incident at the Fish Servant Hut.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had finished all his Naiyuan Pills, and as he had guessed, after eating all the Naiyuan Pills, the progress of the middle section of the "Kai Mai Jue" reached 34 points.</p><p></p><p>However, he had not yet condensed the fifth meridian, nor had he advanced to the fifth level of Qi Cultivation, so it seemed he still needed some time.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there was another issue that made Zhou You feel a bit helpless, which was the drug resistance and elixir toxicity problem.</p><p></p><p>Starting from the twentieth Naiyuan Pill, drug resistance had manifested, and the effects were clearly not as strong. Additionally, elixir toxicity had accumulated in his body, requiring Zhou You to spend more time every day expelling those toxins.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Zhou You's spiritual power was strong enough to condense and expel those toxins over time, which also indicated one problem - elixirs could not be consumed continuously.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating as usual, Zhou You took out his talisman brush and began drawing talismans.</p><p></p><p>Over the past twenty-odd days of practice, the nearly one hundred talisman papers from the fat cultivator had been consumed by Zhou You, and he had even gone to the Inner Court to buy a few more bundles of talisman paper.</p><p></p><p>From an initial success rate of only ten to twenty percent, the success rate had now reached over seventy percent.</p><p></p><p>The progress of the Fire Talisman imprint had also reached over ninety points.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You estimated that if the progress was complete, the success rate of drawing talismans should be around eighty percent.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was limited to the Fire Talisman.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's movements were skilled, and each stroke was extremely neat and upright. He quickly completed a talisman and infused it with spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>The talisman flickered with a red light, and a Fire Talisman was thus produced.</p><p></p><p>"I've already drawn about fifty Fire Talismans."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You looked at the Fire Talismans laid out on the ground, and together with the forty-odd Fire Talismans in the fat cultivator's storage bag, he now had nearly one hundred Fire Talismans.</p><p></p><p>If all these Fire Talismans were thrown out together, even a cultivator at the seventh or eighth level of Qi Cultivation might not be able to withstand them.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You drew a few more talismans, failing only once.</p><p></p><p>[Fire Talisman (100/100): A basic talisman, daily practice will eventually lead to success.]</p><p></p><p>The golden imprint indicated that the Fire Talisman had been perfected.</p><p></p><p>With a flash of golden light, Zhou You's spiritual sense began to increase.</p><p></p><p>As Zhou You had guessed, the enhancements from these things were almost all related to spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>Drawing talismans required a great deal of mental effort, similar to formations. The stronger one's spiritual sense, the easier it was to get started, and the higher the success rate.</p><p></p><p>"The range of my spiritual sense has increased by twenty zhang. I'm only ten zhang away from reaching the level of the eighth stage of Qi Cultivation. If I'm at the eighth stage of Qi Cultivation and use all my power to employ the Qian Shen Shu, I should be able to conceal myself from the casual spiritual sense inspection of a late Foundation Establishment cultivator."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You pondered silently, then said, "My six senses have become much sharper. It seems the enhancement from perfecting the Fire Talisman is also related to spiritual power."</p><p></p><p>[Fire Talisman] perfected</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Zhou You began drawing tranquility talismans again. </p><p></p><p>As for the first-grade intermediate-level earth explosion talisman, it was not yet within Zhou You's consideration for the time being.</p><p></p><p>The success rate was slightly lower, so it was better to improve his talisman cultivation first before attempting it, in order to reduce losses.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flew like flowing water, and in the blink of an eye, another month had passed. Zhou You had been cultivating for almost nine months without realizing it. </p><p></p><p>During this past month, Zhou You's life had finally settled into tranquility.</p><p></p><p>During this period, he almost never saw any other living people nearby, except when he turned in the spirit fish. Zhou You turned in all the spirit fish from the previous three months at once, which was when he saw living people at Xiao Yuying's small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou You rather enjoyed this pace of life. </p><p></p><p>It seemed leisurely, yet each day was full of vigor and very fulfilling.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating in the early morning, then drawing talismans, fishing, tending to the herb garden, sharpening his flying sword, practicing newly purchased martial arts, and occasionally going to chop some firewood to bring back.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was already winter, and as someone who had not yet opened his meridians, Zhou You naturally needed firewood to get through the winter. He could conveniently chop a large amount of firewood.</p><p></p><p>It was just a pity that the progress of [Woodcutting] was still slow, only reaching over 10 points so far.</p><p></p><p>To fill it up, who knows how many trees would suffer?</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Zhou You was not in a hurry. He could take it slow with this.</p><p></p><p>Apart from [Woodcutting], Zhou You had also perfected [Tranquility Talisman]. This time, in addition to enhancing his spiritual sense by twenty zhang and reaching the strength of the eighth layer of Qi cultivation, Zhou You unexpectedly discovered that his spiritual soul had also been slightly strengthened.</p><p></p><p>It had become more stable!</p><p></p><p>The spiritual soul had always been the most fragile part of a cultivator. Once damaged, it could lead to diminished intelligence and becoming an idiot in the mild case, or death in the severe case.</p><p></p><p>The strengthening of the spiritual soul was something Zhou You had not expected.</p><p></p><p>Although it was only a slight improvement, it was still a good omen.</p><p></p><p>It showed that the spiritual soul could be strengthened through golden imprints.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the few new martial arts he had been practicing were also approaching perfection. Once they reached perfection, his physical state would likely advance further.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of herbs was also progressing steadily. [Planting] had reached a progress of 5, and Zhou You discovered that the more progress in [Planting], the stronger the catalytic effect on the herbs!</p><p></p><p>Previously, the catalytic effect on herbs was only one-tenth, but now that the progress had reached 5, the catalytic effect had increased to one-fifth, a significant improvement of 50%.</p><p></p><p>This made Zhou You even more eager to see what terrifying level the catalytic effect would reach if [Planting] was perfected.</p><p></p><p>"Huff...I should be about to advance to the fifth layer of Qi Cultivation, right?"</p><p></p><p>After finishing his cultivation, Zhou You did not open his eyes, but instead observed the changes in the golden imprint and the meridians within his body with his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>As expected.</p><p></p><p>The fifth meridian had completely solidified, emitting a brilliant golden light.</p><p></p><p>The golden imprint in his consciousness also radiated light at this moment.</p><p></p><p>[Opening Meridians Scripture: Intermediate Part (40/100): A foundational cultivation method. Exhaling and inhaling daily, progress increases by 1 every six days, can be completed in one year and eight months!]</p><p></p><p>The progress had reached 40!</p><p></p><p>The fifth layer of Qi Cultivation!</p><p></p><p>A large amount of spiritual energy condensed from the meridians, surging into the dantian, then dispersing from the dantian throughout his entire body, cleansing his physical form.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, some impurities were expelled from Zhou You's body.</p><p></p><p>However, the impurities expelled now were far less than before.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, the fifth layer of Qi Cultivation! One step closer to the Foundation Establishment realm!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You exhaled and got up, washing away the impurities on his body. His whole being felt extraordinarily light.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the whetstone on the shore that he had grinded down significantly and couldn't help but smile: "Looks like I need to make a trip to the market town."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

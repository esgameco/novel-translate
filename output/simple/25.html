            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>[The Meridian Opening Manual - Middle Section (4/100): A basic cultivation technique. Exhaling and inhaling daily, it takes six days to increase one progress point. It can be completed in one year and eight months!]</p><p></p><p>After refining the Yuan Cultivating Pill, the golden seal in Zhou You's sea of knowledge flashed and a line of text appeared. </p><p></p><p>Zhou You was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Because just four days ago, the progress of the middle section of the Meridian Opening Manual had increased by one point, reaching 3 points.</p><p></p><p>According to the cultivation speed of the middle section, one had to cultivate for six days to increase the progress by 1 point. But today was only the fourth day!</p><p></p><p>In other words, if Zhou You wanted to reach progress point 4, he would have to cultivate for two more days to meet the condition of increasing progress by 1 point.</p><p></p><p>However, after taking the Yuan Cultivating Pill and starting to cultivate, while refining the pill and absorbing the spiritual qi of heaven and earth, in just two hours, the progress of the middle section of the Meridian Opening Manual directly reached 4 points!</p><p></p><p>It shortened the cultivation time by one day!</p><p></p><p>Two hours of cultivation was equivalent to two days of regular cultivation!</p><p></p><p>The cultivation efficiency had doubled!</p><p></p><p>This showed just how powerful the effect of the Yuan Cultivating Pill was.</p><p></p><p>Considering this, as long as Zhou You had enough Yuan Cultivating Pills, he could completely double his cultivation efficiency. Originally, it took six days to increase one progress point, but if he took one Yuan Cultivating Pill daily, it would only take three days to increase one point!</p><p></p><p>In ten months' time, he could complete the middle section of the Meridian Opening Manual and reach the sixth level of Qi Refining cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the prerequisite was having that many Yuan Cultivating Pills for Zhou You to consume.</p><p></p><p>Although the Yuan Cultivating Pill was the lowest grade of cultivation pill, each one was worth fifteen spirit stones. Even though Zhou You had gained a fortune after killing Huang Li, he could only afford to buy six or seven of them.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the saying goes that the most important things for cultivation are wealth, methods, and location, with wealth being the top priority. Cultivation is a battle for resources - whoever has more resources is more likely to reach the end."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You sighed and hesitated, but eventually put away the remaining four Yuan Cultivating Pills.</p><p></p><p>He had originally wanted to try continuing to cultivate after completing the two-hour session by taking another pill.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, he restrained himself.</p><p></p><p>Excluding the three Yuan Cultivating Pills given by Xiao Yueyingzi, Zhou You only had four left.</p><p></p><p>Consuming one meant having one less. It was better not to take risks. What if after taking the pill, no matter how he cultivated, he could not gain spiritual power? That would be a huge loss.</p><p></p><p>"If cultivating medicinal herbs can also reduce their growth cycle, I could head towards becoming a pill refiner in the future. After refining pills and combining them with the golden seal's abilities, I should be able to rapidly increase my cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You pondered silently. "With the golden seal's capabilities, I should be able to achieve some success in learning skills like pill refining and talisman making, right?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You had a very clear understanding of his own path of immortal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>For now, he was still at the starting stage, and his progress was not fast - he could only advance slowly and steadily.</p><p></p><p>However, once he reached the middle stage, everything would gradually improve.</p><p></p><p>So Zhou You was not in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>After completing his cultivation, Zhou You began his busy day.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>From that day onward, after taking the pill, Zhou You began taking pills daily for his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, it only took three days for the progress of the middle section of the Meridian Opening Manual to increase by one more point, reaching 5.</p><p></p><p>The weather also gradually turned colder. The ancient trees by the lake began to shed their leaves, and autumn deepened. After ten days, the progress of the Meridian Opening Manual reached 6 points, and the Body Condensation Technique was completed that morning.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, the completion of the Body Condensation Technique improved Zhou You's physical qualities, and his physical strength reached the second level of Body Tempering!</p><p></p><p>This caused Zhou You's physical power to increase explosively. He tried it out and could easily lift a half-meter thick log.</p><p></p><p>His body's resistance to strikes and defensive abilities were also correspondingly enhanced. Even against attacks from Fireball Technique, he could withstand them for a short while!</p><p></p><p>For Zhou You, it was a huge improvement.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the most important thing was that the Fireball Technique was also completed during this period. Through Zhou You's unremitting efforts, daily practice...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He practiced the Fireball Spell hundreds of times. At the beginning, he had to use the Qi Recovery Technique after every thirty times to replenish his magic power. Later on, he could cast it fifty times before depleting all his magic power. </p><p></p><p>The success of the Fireball Spell was not just about mastering the spell itself, but also Zhou You's control over his magic power, reaching the point where he could manipulate it at will!</p><p></p><p>His magic power also became extremely concentrated, allowing one portion to be used as two portions.</p><p></p><p>The biggest gain, apart from being able to cast the Fireball Spell instantly, was the enhancement of his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>He found that after perfecting the Fireball Spell, his spiritual sense had actually increased further!</p><p></p><p>Although still at the strength of the sixth level of Qi cultivation, it now reached a range of thirty-five zhang. Only fifteen zhang away from the level of the seventh level of Qi cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This was Zhou You's gain after perfecting the Fireball Spell.</p><p></p><p>"However, it seems that my Fireball Spell is a bit more powerful than Huang Li's, and its flying speed is also much faster."</p><p></p><p>Zhou You raised his hand, and a fireball the size of a head instantly flew out, landing on the lake surface and evaporating a considerable amount of water from Lake Erhai. "I wonder if Huang Li didn't cultivate the Fireball Spell to its utmost?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou You's guess was possible.</p><p></p><p>For such a basic spell like the Fireball Spell, few people would practice it diligently until perfection. Generally, they would stop once they could use it.</p><p></p><p>Who would be like Zhou You, practicing it hundreds of times a day until reaching perfection?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this was the reason why Huang Li's Fireball Spell didn't reach its ultimate level.</p><p></p><p>In any case, spending so much time practicing the Fireball Spell was not a waste.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the herbs Zhou You planted had also sprouted and started growing slowly.</p><p></p><p>The growth cycle of herbs was much longer than that of regular cabbages.</p><p></p><p>The shortest was one year, while the longest could be several years or even decades.</p><p></p><p>Most herbs became more potent the longer they matured after reaching a certain age.</p><p></p><p>Zhou You was not in a hurry. He observed the growth of the herbs day by day, referring to the information in books about cultivating ordinary herbs.</p><p></p><p>As for the sword-wielding girl, she came to fish for more than an hour every day during these ten days, though her timing was irregular. However, the result was always the same - she didn't catch a single spiritual fish.</p><p></p><p>After this period of interaction, Zhou You finally confirmed that this girl indeed seemed not very intelligent.</p><p></p><p>There were several times when Zhou You wanted to teach her how to fish, but eventually gave up the idea after seeing her social anxiety.</p><p></p><p>However, their relationship was not bad.</p><p></p><p>If it was around noon when Zhou You cooked, he would make two portions, giving one to the girl. The girl didn't seem to be fasting or know how to refuse, as she accepted it every time.</p><p></p><p>As for her, it seemed that because Zhou You had once read a travel journal while fishing, she assumed Zhou You liked reading books. So every time she came, she would bring an ancient book and swiftly place it at Zhou You's fishing spot before leaving when he was not around.</p><p></p><p>This made Zhou You somewhat amused yet helpless.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Zhou You would not refuse, as he had a great thirst for knowledge about the cultivation world, so having books to read was naturally good.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had mastered the Body Shrinking Technique and could change his appearance and physical characteristics, he felt he could try selling the stolen goods in his possession and sell the surplus spiritual fish in batches to earn some money.</p><p></p><p>In these four months, he could hoard more than sixty spiritual fish every month. Excluding the ones he had grilled, there were still over a hundred left.</p><p></p><p>It was not ideal to keep them in the fish tank forever.</p><p></p><p>However, before doing so, Zhou You planned to go to Taibai Academy first and listen to the so-called public lecture.</p><p></p><p>It would be in the next few days.</p><p></p><p>Yet, before he could prepare to go, someone from Taibai Academy had already found him.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 20</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Lin family did not wage an all-out war against the Su family as Lin Kuiwei had threatened, but instead retreated and kept a low profile. </p><p></p><p>Guo Chudong fell into the hands of the Su family. He used his first-grade spirit vein as a bargaining chip and offered to construct a blessed land for the Su family for free in exchange for them sparing his life.</p><p></p><p>However, the Su family's appetite was much bigger than he had imagined. There was no way they would let him go.</p><p></p><p>From then on, Guo Chudong obediently stayed in the Su family to serve as a servant.</p><p></p><p>After falling into the Su family's hands, Guo Chudong began diligently working, searching for dragons and locating spirit veins. He quickly found the core of a first-grade spirit vein beneath the herbal garden.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, he excavated an underground blessed land and attempted to mine spirit ore.</p><p></p><p>The first-grade spirit vein only produced a few hundred low-grade spirit stones per month.</p><p></p><p>But if accumulated, it would amount to one or two thousand low-grade spirit stones in a year.</p><p></p><p>For the Su family, this was not a small number.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these matters had little to do with Su Yu. He did not pay attention to the spirit vein affairs. After sending Su Qingyi away, Su Yu continued to cultivate diligently.</p><p></p><p>After practicing the Cypress Yearly Cycle Technique, Su Yu unexpectedly found that this technique greatly aided his Spirit Nurturing Art.</p><p></p><p>The previously slow-progressing proficiency of the Spirit Nurturing Art increased by nearly thirty percent under the influence of the Cypress Yearly Cycle Technique.</p><p></p><p>As for the core power of the Blood Whale Devouring the Moon Technique, it was accumulating and perfecting with the ample supply of demonic beast meat.</p><p></p><p>A month and a half later, the construction of the Su family's herbal garden blessed land was completed. Layer upon layer of formations were laid on the mountain at the core, binding and gathering the spirit vein's spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>With the scale of a first-grade spirit vein, the daily supply was sufficient for over a hundred Qi Refining cultivators to practice.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu moved into the blessed land, where the spiritual energy density was at least fifty percent higher than outside.</p><p></p><p>In such an environment, Su Yu's Qi Refining speed improved slightly.</p><p></p><p>With the blessed land of the spirit vein, the family master Su Peng and others all moved out of Jiangcheng City and settled within the blessed land, naming it Cangshan, as the Su family's ancient ancestor was named Su Cang.</p><p></p><p>From now on, Cangshan would be the Su family's foothold.</p><p></p><p>As for the Lin family?</p><p></p><p>The Su family did not immediately take action against them. With the foundation of the spirit vein, the most important task for the Su family at present was to develop and grow.</p><p></p><p>Seizing the opportunity of obtaining the blessed land of the spirit vein and enhancing the family's strength was the top priority. There was no need to engage in a life-and-death struggle with the Lin family at this time.</p><p></p><p>If the family's strength increased, and even a Foundation Establishment elder emerged, then dealing with the Lin family would be like crushing an ant.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu did not know what rewards the family had discussed, but he knew that Su Peng gave him a token, and his original Qi Refining third-level family monthly allowance of six low-grade spirit stones was increased to sixty low-grade spirit stones per month.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the family gave him one thousand low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>With so many resources and over a hundred drops of late-stage demonic beast essence blood, Su Yu began secluded cultivation in the blessed land.</p><p></p><p>A year passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Four years had gone by since returning from the Cloud Sword Sect, and Su Yu was now twenty years old.</p><p></p><p>With the blessed land of the spirit vein and an ample supply of low-grade spirit stones, Su Yu's cultivation speed greatly improved.</p><p></p><p>The bottleneck from the third to the fourth level of Qi Refining was as smooth as a level path, and he broke through silently overnight.</p><p></p><p>When Su Yu completed another cycle of the Cypress Yearly Cycle Technique, gaining another strand of the aura of years, the proficiency of his Spirit Nurturing Art also reached 100% perfection.</p><p></p><p>In the room, Su Yu sat cross-legged, emanating a greenish glow. Faintly, it seemed as if a towering ancient tree appeared behind him.</p><p></p><p>With the Spirit Nurturing Art perfected, Su Yu's spiritual sense also gained a faint green luminescence.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Su Yu seemed to be able to sense the life auras of countless plants, flowers, grasses, and trees from all directions.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Even the dynamic and stillness of spirit medicines inhaling and exhaling the spiritual qi of heaven and earth, which was similar to 'breathing', he was able to perceive.</p><p></p><p>However, it was only for a short moment when Su Yu felt a stabbing pain in his mind and woke up. </p><p></p><p>That state just now had actually exhausted his spiritual energy through just breathing.</p><p></p><p>After regaining his senses, Su Yu closed his eyes to recuperate for a moment, then slowly opened them, recalling that state, he couldn't help being shocked: "The Qingmu Suixuan Gong combined with the perfected Yunling Art has such a wondrous effect?"</p><p></p><p>Although that state was very draining on the spirit and consumed a great deal of energy, but in that state, he could sense the plants within a radius of several miles around him.</p><p></p><p>If he used this method to search for precious spirit medicines in the wildâ€”</p><p></p><p>"When my cultivation level is higher, this idea is completely feasible." Su Yu secretly rejoiced.</p><p></p><p>He focused his mind and looked at the proficiency panel.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Su Yu.]</p><p>[Cultivation: Refining Qi Realm, Fourth Level.]</p><p>[Longevity: 20/109.]</p><p>[Cultivation Methods: Qingmu Suixuan Gong (One Cycle Four Rotations, Proficiency 0.01%), Crocodile Demon's 108 Body Refining Techniques (Fifth Layer, Proficiency 62.87%), Blood Whale Swallowing Moon Art (First Realm, Proficiency 0.01%).]</p><p>[Spells: Wood Vine Art (Perfected), Nurturing Spirit Art (Perfected), Spirit Javelin Art (Perfected), Storing Spirit Art (Perfected).]</p><p></p><p>Looking at the proficiency panel, Su Yu pondered: "Breaking through to the fourth level of the Refining Qi Realm, my spiritual power has increased by nearly thirty percent."</p><p></p><p>"The power seems to have also slightly increased."</p><p></p><p>This was the change in his own spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>And looking at his longevity, although it took him two years to break through from the third to the fourth level of the Refining Qi Realm, his lifespan had actually increased by a full five years after the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, he seemed to have become 'younger'?</p><p></p><p>"The Qingmu Suixuan Gong has made a breakthrough, the Body Refining Technique will probably take another year and a half." Su Yu was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>With the assistance of the spirit blood of a late-stage demonic beast, the progress of the Body Refining Technique was extremely fast.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was breaking through from the fifth to the sixth layer, it would take no more than two and a half years.</p><p></p><p>As for the Blood Whale Swallowing Moon Art, Su Yu looked at the lack of progress in its proficiency with some thought.</p><p></p><p>This, strictly speaking, was not a cultivation method, but rather a pseudo-divine ability.</p><p></p><p>It did not require regular cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After the core of the pseudo-divine ability was condensed, and enough energy was accumulated, it could be erupted at a critical moment to increase one's strength.</p><p></p><p>He estimated that this proficiency would only change after he unleashed the pseudo-divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the spells.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu looked at the few spells he had, thinking: "Now that I've reached the fourth level of the Refining Qi Realm, I can learn a few more spells."</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Su Yu went out and headed to the Repository Pavilion, which had been moved to the blessed land, to get two spells from the Fifth Elder Su Bin.</p><p></p><p>One was a stronger wood-attribute spell for restraining enemies: the Myriad Wood Vine Art.</p><p></p><p>The other was a stronger wood-attribute offensive spell: the Devouring Spirit Art.</p><p></p><p>As he was about to leave, Su Yu's steps suddenly paused, and he looked towards the ancient jade boxes that Su Bin had placed on the counter, his brows slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Noticing his gaze, Su Bin immediately smiled enthusiastically: "Good boy, has your chance arrived? These are good things I scavenged from a great ruin not long ago, and there are definitely ancient opportunities inside."</p><p></p><p>"Ten low-grade spirit stones for one, no bargaining."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Yu's face instantly darkened, and he angrily said: "Didn't you used to sell them for one low-grade spirit stone each?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe." Su Bin laughed: "That's not something produced from an ancient ruin."</p><p></p><p>Note: It's my second brother's wedding today, so I need to help out. There will only be one update for the next two days, and I'll make it up tomorrow.</p>

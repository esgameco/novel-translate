        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Half a month later.</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi asked for leave from Yunjianzong and came to Yunshan Town to meet up with Su Yu. After not seeing each other for a few years, Su Zhi's cultivation had already reached the eighth level of Qi Refining Realm. </p><p></p><p>Having become an inner disciple of Yunjianzong, Su Zhi received more and better resources from the sect.  This speed of cultivation advancement could not be compared to ordinary cultivator clans or wandering cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a light blue dress with a sword at her waist, if Su Qingyi had grown from an arrogant young man into a mature and somewhat ruthless cultivator of the clan, then over these years, Su Zhi had transformed from a clan cultivator into an ethereal sect maiden.</p><p></p><p>That kind of temperament was completely different from cultivators who grew up in clans.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the change in temperament, Su Zhi's appearance did not change much, still looking like a young girl.</p><p></p><p>Coming to the Pill Pavilion and seeing that Su Yu's appearance also did not change much, Su Zhi pondered for a moment and said, "I have a feeling that I can't see through you, and I have never felt this way with our fellow disciples."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu showed an innocent expression and said to her, "Sister, my whole body is standing right in front of you, I just need to take off my clothes, how can you not see through me?"</p><p></p><p>"How could I have that ability?"</p><p></p><p>When Su Zhi heard "just need to take off clothes", she couldn't help but chide, "Slick talker."</p><p></p><p>After chatting for a while, Su Zhi looked around and said in a low voice, "Originally I thought Junior Sister Chen would have a better fate with you, I didn't expect that she would end up with Qingyi."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu said in surprise, "I don't feel that way at all? Sister, don't talk nonsense, it's good that the two of them are together."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's not talk about it anymore." Su Zhi smiled wryly and did not continue on this topic.</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi said, "Wait until the sect stabilizes a bit, I'll see if I can introduce you to some junior or senior sisters."</p><p></p><p>"The Second Elder has ordered that a good partner must be found for you."</p><p></p><p>"With your current status as a first-grade high-rank pill refiner and talisman master, as well as your talents, you can choose even among the inner sect's senior sisters."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu hurriedly begged for mercy, saying, "Sister, let's change the subject."</p><p></p><p>"I want to know if there are any formidable second-grade pill refiners or talisman masters within the Yunjianzong's domain?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Zhi pondered and said, "The Elder of our Yunjianzong's inner sect Pill Pavilion is quite formidable, being a second-grade high-rank pill refiner and also a peak Foundation Establishment cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"However, since you are not a disciple of Yunjianzong, it would be impossible for you to become his apprentice."</p><p></p><p>"Apart from the pill refiners and talisman masters of Yunjianzong, hmm, the White Flame Pill Refiner of Wuyan Mountain is a decent choice. He should be the strongest pill refiner among the wandering cultivators within Yunjianzong's domain, being a second-grade high-rank pill refiner."</p><p></p><p>"However, this person is always in seclusion, has an eccentric temperament, and I haven't heard of him taking in any disciples, so it would probably be very difficult to become his apprentice."</p><p></p><p>After looking conflicted for a while, Su Zhi looked at Su Yu and said, "There aren't that many good pill refiners or talisman masters within our Yunjianzong's domain. If you really want to take a master, I think you should go to Yuexian City."</p><p></p><p>"That's a large town, with five times more cultivators than Yunshan Town."</p><p></p><p>"For those wandering cultivators, staying in Yuexian City would be much more comfortable than in small towns under the control of powers like us."</p><p></p><p>"So it would be easier for you to take a master there. I've heard that there are even third-grade pill refiner wandering cultivators there."</p><p></p><p>After chatting with Su Zhi about many things she had seen and heard, especially regarding Yuexian City, Su Yu took the opportunity to ask many questions about that city.</p><p></p><p>"The real name of Bai Yue Zhenren is Yang Disheng. He has three disciples, or you could say three core administrators of the immortal city."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Bai Yue Zhenren's real name, Su Yu's expression froze slightly, "?"</p><p></p><p>He then quickly asked, "What are the names of his three disciples?"</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi did not notice Su Yu's change in expression and said, "The eldest disciple is 'Tian Pu Laoren' in the Pseudo-Pill Formation realm, the second disciple is 'Feng Ling Xianzi' at the peak of Foundation Establishment realm, the third disciple is..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Xu Wansheng was said to have just broken through to the Foundation Establishment realm."</p><p></p><p>When Su Yu heard the words "Feng Ling Xian Zi", a name popped into his head: Tian Yue Xie Hou (Demonic Celestial Moon Mistress).</p><p></p><p>He tightened his clothes, because he felt a bit cold. </p><p></p><p>If the Bai Yue Zhen Ren (Real Person of Worshipping the Moon) of Bai Yue Xian Cheng (City of Worshipping the Moon) was a small boss of the demonic path in the beginner's realm, then Tian Yue Xie Hou was the big boss who almost destroyed the beginner's map area.</p><p></p><p>However—</p><p></p><p>This was the plot of the game he played in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>Although this Bai Yue Xian Cheng was quite similar, in the game the Bai Yue Zhen Ren only had one disciple, but here there were three.</p><p></p><p>It was a bit different.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, there was no Da Yue Fu (Grand Moon Mansion), no Da Yue Gong (Grand Moon Palace), and no Yun Jian Zong (Cloud Sword Sect) in the previous life," Su Yu muttered.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, cold sweat broke out on Su Yu's forehead.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yue Xie Hou—</p><p>The Tian Yue Xie Hou who almost destroyed the beginner's map area, Yue (Moon)?</p><p></p><p>Could this Yue (Moon) be related to Da Yue Fu and Da Yue Gong?</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Before Su Yu could ponder too long, Su Yun finished arranging the matters of the Dan Ge (Pill Pavilion) and came out, returning to the Jiang Cheng Family with Su Yu and Su Zhi.</p><p></p><p>After leaving Yun Shan Fang Shi (Cloud Mountain Town), the three of them rode spirit horses and traveled quickly.</p><p></p><p>Those at the Qi Refining realm could fly on artifacts, but flying consumed a lot of energy. It was fine for short distances, but for long distances, those at the Qi Refining realm simply could not endure it.</p><p></p><p>If they exhausted themselves too much and encountered an emergency on the road, it would be over.</p><p></p><p>However, if the Su Family could buy a spiritual ship artifact, then there would be no problem.</p><p></p><p>"Hum!"</p><p></p><p>Not far from where Su Yu and the others left Yun Shan Fang Shi, a formation was suddenly activated. Yellowish-brown mist rose like roaring earth dragons, forming a cage that tightly trapped Su Yu and the other two.</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, people from the Su Family?" A person wearing a mask appeared. In an instant, he trapped Su Yu and the others in the formation, and numerous sword artifacts condensed in the air.</p><p></p><p>Without a word of nonsense, the next moment, myriad swords struck together, and their terrifying metallic aura slashed towards Su Yu and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Hum!"</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi's expression changed drastically. With a wave of her hand, a golden bell artifact rose into the air, and a golden barrier instantly enveloped the three of them.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The mid-grade bell artifact only lasted for two breaths before the golden barrier shattered.</p><p></p><p>However, only a small portion of those spell-formed swords remained. Su Zhi and Su Yun joined forces to block and shatter them while protecting Su Yu in the middle.</p><p></p><p>Su Yun's face darkened as he glared at the person angrily, "You dare show up, 'Gui Tou Jin Diao' (Ghostly Headed Golden Eagle)!"</p><p></p><p>"Shua shua!"</p><p></p><p>Two more figures appeared within the formation.</p><p></p><p>The Gui Tou Jin Diao let out a few cold laughs, ignoring Su Yun, and said coldly, "Kill them!"</p><p></p><p>The Gui Tou Jin Diao acted again, a sword artifact carrying incomparable sharpness pointing straight at Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>Just as Su Zhi and Su Yun were about to block it, the two figures simultaneously attacked to stop them.</p><p></p><p>These two were only at the eighth level of the Qi Refining realm, but they exuded lethal and decisive killing intent, making it not difficult to block Su Zhi and Su Yun.</p><p></p><p>Kill Su Yu first, then Su Zhi, and finally Su Yun.</p><p></p><p>In the Gui Tou Jin Diao's view, there would be no accidents in this hunt.</p><p></p><p>However, the moment those two appeared, Su Yun and Su Yu both had handfuls of talismans, while Su Zhi also had a few first-grade superior ice talismans.</p><p></p><p>The three of them threw out more than ten first-grade superior talismans at once.</p><p></p><p>P.S. Wishing all the handsome guys and beautiful ladies a happy Lunar New Year's Eve, a happy new year, great prosperity in the new year, good health, good health, good health!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

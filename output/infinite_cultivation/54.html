        <h1>Chapter 54</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Су Юй made a breakthrough in his Cangmu Suixuan cultivation technique, putting him in a very pleasant mood. A few days later, when his neighbor Lan Xi came to ask him to refine pills, he unintentionally performed 'extraordinarily well' and gave both Lan Xi and Lan Gong two top-quality first-grade Qi-refining pills. </p><p></p><p>Just this alone made Lan Xi and Lan Gong very surprised, thinking that Su Yu's pill refining skills were higher than they had imagined, and they became more polite towards Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>Because,</p><p></p><p>Being able to only refine ordinary first-grade top-grade pills meant there was only a 10-20% chance of advancing to become a second-grade lower-rank pill refiner!</p><p></p><p>But being able to refine top-quality first-grade top-grade pills increased the chance of advancing to a second-grade lower-rank pill refiner to 60-70%!</p><p></p><p>Now that Su Yu had shown the ability to refine top-quality first-grade top-grade pills, it was natural for the two of them to be more polite to him.</p><p></p><p>One could even say they had the intention to curry favor with him.</p><p></p><p>After all, what if Su Yu advanced to become a second-grade lower-rank pill refiner, while their cultivation reached the ninth level of the Qi Refining realm?</p><p></p><p>In the next stage, wouldn't they need to seek out a second-grade lower-rank pill refiner to refine Foundation Establishment pills?</p><p></p><p>Not long after,</p><p></p><p>The refining equipment maker neighbor in the alley and the male cultivator with his family of four all learned that Su Yu could refine top-quality first-grade pills.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, both came to Su Yu's door asking him to refine top-quality Qi-refining pills.</p><p></p><p>Although Su Yu controlled the quality of the pills, only successfully refining one top-quality Qi-refining pill for the refining equipment maker while the rest were ordinary, this alone was enough for the equipment maker and male cultivator to treat him with utmost respect.</p><p></p><p>Over 40 years old, at the eighth level of the Qi Refining realm, yet able to refine top-quality first-grade top-grade pills!</p><p></p><p>As long as he reached the ninth level of the Qi Refining realm, he had a chance to become a second-grade lower-rank pill refiner!</p><p></p><p>If he was fortunate enough to break through to the Foundation Establishment realm, then becoming a second-grade lower-rank pill refiner would be a certainty!</p><p></p><p>A few days later,</p><p></p><p>When the talisman master Wu Yugong returned to the alley from the True Palace and heard this news, his expression changed.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there were not countless first-grade top-rank pill refiners in the True Palace as he had said, but only six.</p><p></p><p>Among those six, only one could refine top-quality first-grade top-grade pills, and that person was quite valued by the executives of the True Palace.</p><p></p><p>"That waste...that guy is actually able to refine top-quality first-grade top-grade pills!?" Wu Yugong found it hard to believe, his voice thick with envious hatred, to the point that his face was slightly distorted.</p><p></p><p>That was the 'admission ticket' to advancing to the second grade!</p><p></p><p>As for himself? He had yet to even reach the threshold of a second-grade lower-rank talisman master!</p><p></p><p>However, envy aside, after calming down, Wu Yugong still went to visit Su Yu with a degree of respect and flattery.</p><p></p><p>Licking his face, he wanted to recruit Su Yu to join the True Palace.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, a moment later, he was driven out by Su Yu under the pretext of pill refining.</p><p></p><p>Back in his own room, Wu Yugong's face became extremely ugly, gritting his teeth: "An upstart getting ahead of himself! Just because you can refine top-quality first-grade top-grade pills?"</p><p></p><p>"You dare be arrogant in front of me, a talisman master of the True Palace!?"</p><p></p><p>"Courting death! Courting death! Courting death!"</p><p></p><p>For someone like Wu Yugong who had psychological issues, Su Yu paid him no heed, after all, they were in Bai Yue Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>And Wu Yugong was a talisman master of the True Palace, one of the three palaces of Bai Yue Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Such an identity was truly an unbeatable talisman of protection within Bai Yue Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>The prerequisite was that the guy didn't go out of his way to pick a fight.</p><p></p><p>Another month later,</p><p></p><p>Su Yu looked at the white-haired old lady before him, quite surprised: "Miss Yu is in Bai Yue Immortal City?"</p><p></p><p>The old lady was Huang Haibian, the sea granny who had followed Yu Keran.</p><p></p><p>Now, many years had passed, and the old lady, who was at the ninth level of the Qi Refining realm, was nearing the end of her life span.</p><p></p><p>Huang Haibian nodded slightly: "After the young lady left Yunshan Borough, she came to the base in Bai Yue Immortal City. Recently, she heard that you had come to Bai Yue Immortal City, so she asked me to come and invite you to meet her."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Suyu pondered for a moment, then nodded and said, "Okay."</p><p></p><p>Huang Haimei smiled and said, "The two beast tamers in your hands probably haven't broken through the second stage yet, right?"</p><p></p><p>"If not, you can bring them along."</p><p></p><p>Suyu's eyes sparkled. </p><p></p><p>His own cultivation had no bottleneck, even at the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>But the tamed beasts he had, the Fire Ape and the Black Scaled Eagle, were different. They had both reached the peak of the late first stage demonic beast realm.</p><p></p><p>However, it was not easy to break through to the second stage demonic beast realm.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>In the central district of the inner city of Bai Yue Xian City, inside a rather large beast taming shop, Suyu saw Yuzhuan'er, whom he hadn't seen in many years.</p><p></p><p>Yuzhuan'er was a little younger than him, but now she was also approaching forty years old. </p><p></p><p>Her cultivation was still at the ninth level of the Qi Refining realm, and her appearance hadn't changed much, still looking like the charming young lady he first met her as.</p><p></p><p>Of course, she no longer had the naivety of a young girl, her demeanor had matured a lot.</p><p></p><p>She must have taken some kind of age-delaying or beauty-preserving pill.</p><p></p><p>However, after many years, Suyu saw a cold and stern aura on Yuzhuan'er that he hadn't seen before.</p><p></p><p>Dressed in a crimson red dress, her face was as cold as ice, her gaze icy cold.</p><p></p><p>Suyu was slightly surprised, then smiled and said, "It's been many years, Miss Yu, you've become much more striking than before."</p><p></p><p>Yuzhuan'er looked Suyu up and down for a moment, her cold face and gaze gradually melting, she wrinkled her nose, revealing her true self, pursed her lips and said, "You're a man, did you also take an age-delaying pill?"</p><p></p><p>Suyu smiled without refuting, his age preservation was due to the Cangmu Suilun Gong, not any age-delaying pill.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take that as Miss Yu complimenting my handsome face," Suyu said.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Yuzhuan'er's eyes widened, then she quickly sneered disdainfully, "Pah! You've become even more shameless than before, more shameless!"</p><p></p><p>With just a few sentences, the two seemed to have returned to their former familiar selves.</p><p></p><p>After chatting idly for a while, talking about their recent situations.</p><p></p><p>Yuzhuan'er looked at him, her nose twitching as she smelled the aura of the Fire Ape and Black Scaled Eagle beasts on Suyu.</p><p></p><p>She said, "Take out those two beasts of yours and let me see?"</p><p></p><p>Suyu had no objection, and summoned the two out from his beast taming bag.</p><p></p><p>From hatching until now, Suyu had raised them for more than a decade, feeding them perfect quality Beast Pills every day, nourished by the power of the Cangmu Suilun Gong.</p><p></p><p>These two beasts had grown at more than twice the speed of ordinary demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>Yuzhuan'er looked at the two extremely powerful auras of the peak late-stage first realm Fire Ape and Black Scaled Eagle beasts, among the best she had ever seen. Her expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Then she looked at Suyu enviously and said, "You really are a treasure trove."</p><p></p><p>"If these two beasts could break through to the second stage, they would definitely be the most elite second stage beasts!"</p><p></p><p>Suyu stroked the heads of the Fire Ape and Black Scaled Eagle, looking at Yuzhuan'er with some anticipation, he asked, "Does Miss Yu have a way to help them break through to the second stage?"</p><p></p><p>Yuzhuan'er frowned slightly and said, "There is a way, I have pills here that can help beasts break through to the second stage, but the price is not cheap. And not every beast can break through to the second stage."</p><p></p><p>Suyu inquired further.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the pills Yuzhuan'er mentioned were refined using the demonic cores of second stage beasts of the same attribute as the main ingredient.  </p><p></p><p>Each one was worth about a thousand low-grade spirit stones, with varying prices.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Fire Ape was a fire-attribute beast, so it would need a fire-attribute demonic core pill. After consuming it, it could borrow that power to break through.</p><p></p><p>The Black Scaled Eagle was a metal-attribute beast, so it would need a metal-attribute demonic core pill.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

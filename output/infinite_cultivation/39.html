        <h1>Chapter 39</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The materials for refining Foundation Establishment Pills were basically monopolized by major sects and large cultivating clans. Very few materials could flow out, especially in the Cloud Sword Sect's Cloud Mountain Market. </p><p></p><p>There were six core materials for refining Foundation Establishment Pills. The ordinary materials were still fine.</p><p></p><p>But those six core materials were extremely difficult to collect.</p><p></p><p>During the last auction at the Cloud Mountain Trade Fair, it caused the Cloud Sword Sect to lose face greatly. This time, they released a small amount of Foundation Establishment Pill materials, possibly with the intention of compensating or attracting attention.</p><p></p><p>And at this auction, no accidents occurred again. </p><p></p><p>The Blood Saber Daoist did not dare to come to the Cloud Mountain Market to provoke the Cloud Sword Sect again.</p><p></p><p>After acting arrogantly in the Eight Demon Ridge, the Blood Saber Daoist even disappeared and did not dare to show up again.</p><p></p><p>Only in unexpected or remote situations could he act arrogantly in front of the Cloud Sword Sect. If he really had to confront the Cloud Sword Sect head-on, the Blood Saber Daoist would have to be insane to do so.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Cloud Sword Sect was a major cultivating force with a Pill Condensation Realized Man presiding over it.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Saber Daoist, who was merely at the late Foundation Establishment stage, was no match for the Cloud Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>A few days after the auction ended, news came from within the Cloud Sword Sect that Luo Qianyu, the personal disciple of the great elder, had successfully broken through to the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Su Zhi's letter, Su Yu felt a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>He had only met Luo Qianyu once, yet Su Zhi specifically sent a letter to inform him of Luo Qianyu's breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment stage. What did this mean?</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, he put the letter aside and focused on cultivating in the Pill Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Carefully calculating, it had been two years since he last broke through to the fifth level of the Qi Refining stage. After two years of uninterrupted cultivation, aided by perfect quality first-grade Qi Refining Pills,</p><p></p><p>His proficiency in the Cypress Wood Cycle Technique had increased by 39.21%.</p><p></p><p>As for the Alligator One Hundred and Eight Body Refining Technique, it had just broken through the seventh level a year ago, and its proficiency had increased from the original 44.7% to 57.49%.</p><p></p><p>It was estimated that it would take another three to four years for the Cypress Wood Cycle Technique to reach the sixth cycle.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, the Alligator One Hundred and Eight Body Refining Technique would also require more than three years.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu had no sense of impatience regarding his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As he progressed in cultivating the Cypress Wood Cycle Technique, his lifespan would increase along with his cultivation level. In the short term, he only needed to focus on cultivation without worrying about his lifespan.</p><p></p><p>With no lifespan issues and no bottlenecks in his cultivation techniques, which only required reaching a certain proficiency level to advance, what was there for him to worry about?</p><p></p><p>It was better to cultivate steadily and calmly.</p><p></p><p>Outside, due to the influx of demonic cultivators and rogue cultivators into the Cloud Sword Sect's territory, there had been some unrest in the cities and cultivating clans near the Cloud Mountain Market. Some cultivating clans seemed eager to seize this opportunity for change.</p><p></p><p>Conflicts and unrest similar to the previous ones between the Su Clan and the Lin Clan had become more common, such as the current struggle between the Chen Clan and the Bai Clan.</p><p></p><p>Especially when some cultivating clans colluded with the invading demonic cultivators and rogue cultivators, leading to the annihilation of entire cultivating clans â€“ an occurrence that was rarely seen before but now happened repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>More than a year later.</p><p></p><p>When Su Jingbang delivered spirit herbs to the Pill Pavilion in the Cloud Mountain Market, he also brought bad news.</p><p></p><p>"Not long ago, the Bai Clan from Maple City launched a surprise attack on the Chen Clan's Purple Gold Sand Spirit Mine. Apart from the two Foundation Establishment elders of the Bai Clan, there was also an elder from the Huang Clan of Observation Ridge Mountain. In total, three Foundation Establishment cultivators took action."</p><p></p><p>"The second-grade spirit mine's defensive grand formation of the Chen Clan was nearly breached. The Chen Clan's patriarch was severely injured, and Qing Yi also lost an arm in that battle. The Chen Clan lost more than a dozen cultivators, and my Su Clan also had a few cultivators guarding the mine killed, suffering heavy losses."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Bai Clan has been driven back for now, the Chen Clan could barely defend the spirit mine this time. If there's a next time... the Chen Clan may not be able to hold on."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Su Jingbang shook his head, not optimistic about the Chen family's ability to defend the Purple Golden Sand Spirit Vein. </p><p></p><p>Su Yu was not surprised by this.</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation world, every resource site was a huge trouble. Resources were limited, so if you wanted to occupy a resource area, you had to be prepared for major troubles.</p><p></p><p>The Chen family's Purple Golden Sand Spirit Vein was one such case. </p><p></p><p>However, what was going on with the Huang family of Guanlan Mountain? How did they get involved? Su Yu had heard of this cultivation family skilled in formation arts.</p><p></p><p>If the cultivation families under Cloud Sword Sect were ranked, the Yu family of Black Rock Mountain would be second only to the Guan family. Another low-profile but powerful family was the Jiang family, skilled in puppetry, whose strength was no less than the Yu family's.</p><p></p><p>The Huang family of Guanlan Mountain might rank third or in the top five.  </p><p></p><p>With the Huang family's power and strength, they should not have looked down upon a mere Purple Golden Sand Spirit Vein, nor committed such an outrageous act?</p><p></p><p>Su Yu voiced his doubts. As Su Jingbang was about to speak, Su Yundao said, "Recently all kinds of resources are in short supply. Purple golden sand is an important material for forging formation flags, so it's not surprising the Huang family intervened."</p><p></p><p>Su Jingbang said, "The patriarch now intends to withdraw from the contest for the Purple Golden Sand Spirit Vein, but...it may still take some time."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Su Yu felt relieved, as he had felt they should not get involved with that spirit vein.</p><p></p><p>It was good they were withdrawing now!</p><p></p><p>However, events outpaced plans. Four months later, there was a sudden reversal regarding the Chen family's Purple Golden Sand Spirit Vein. An elder of the Bai family at the Foundation Establishment realm, along with some Foundation Establishment cultivators from the Huang family, encountered the Blood Saber Cultivators and were all slaughtered by them.</p><p></p><p>The Bai family was severely damaged! They retreated back to Maple City, trembling in fear of being targeted by the Blood Saber Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the Chen family's Purple Golden Sand Spirit Vein was temporarily free of risk and threats. The Su family patriarch Su Peng also suspended his plan to withdraw from it.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu was stunned for a long time upon hearing this news. Who could have imagined the Bai and Huang families would suffer such misfortune? Su Yu muttered, "It seems the Chen family still has luck on their side and their fate is not sealed. If Heaven wants to feed the Su family, we can't refuse to eat."</p><p></p><p>A month later, an unexpected group of guests visited.</p><p></p><p>Yu Ke'er, along with an old woman, and Chen Sisi leading two elders of the Chen family, a party of five, came to the Su family's Pill Pavilion in Cloud Mountain Town.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Yu, this is the third elder of my Chen family, and this is the fourth elder," Chen Sisi introduced them to Su Yu. "This is my husband's clansman, Su Yu, a first-rank top-grade pill master."</p><p></p><p>Upon Chen Sisi's introduction, the two Chen family elders looked at Su Yu with complex expressions - a mix of surprise and envy.</p><p></p><p>How could the Chen family not have such a young prodigy?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yu Ke'er and Chen Sisi together, Su Yu asked in surprise and hesitation, "May I ask what brings you all to see me?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Sisi was about to speak, but the third elder of the Chen family stopped her.</p><p></p><p>This matter involved the Chen family and Yu Ke'er of the Yu family's third branch. Since Chen Sisi had married into the Su family, it was inappropriate for her to speak up at this point.</p><p></p><p>The third Chen elder said, "Young friend Su, it's like this. We discovered a group of rock rats with a second-grade early-stage rat king in the Purple Golden Sand Spirit Vein. We've heard of the Su family's famed beast-luring powder and its unique effects on rock rats. I wonder if you have any beast-luring powder effective against second-grade early-stage rock rat kings?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu asked in surprise, "You want to hunt and subdue second-grade early-stage rock rat demonic beasts?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Ke'er then interjected, "Not hunt, but capture and tame."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 64</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Driving a second-grade lower-rank puppet beast requires mid-grade spirit stones. One mid-grade spirit stone is equivalent to one hundred lower-grade spirit stones, but to exchange for one mid-grade spirit stone, it often requires one hundred and five or six lower-grade spirit stones. </p><p></p><p>Su Yu had prepared twenty in advance, and now placed ten mid-grade spirit stones into the core of the Dragon Alligator puppet beast.</p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>With the core activated, an extremely ferocious demonic aura emanated from the Dragon Alligator puppet beast's body.</p><p></p><p>This time, Su Yu did not dare to recklessly use his body refining technique to fight against the Dragon Alligator puppet beast.</p><p></p><p>The aura from the Dragon Alligator puppet beast gave him a chilling feeling, far exceeding his own level, even stronger than the third level of the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it could even exchange blows with the fourth level of the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>If he wanted to clash with the Dragon Alligator puppet beast, he would have to wait until his Willow Wood Cycle Skill reached the second cycle third rotation, or until his body refining technique reached the twelfth or thirteenth level.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I will turn it into a Dao Body puppet." Su Yu looked at the Dragon Alligator puppet beast with burning eyes.</p><p></p><p>For it, Su Yu had spent nearly six thousand lower-grade spirit stones on materials alone.</p><p></p><p>If he had a second-grade lower-rank puppet master make it and auction it off, it would be a fantasy to even double the price.</p><p></p><p>He had spent several years collecting the materials.</p><p></p><p>Inside the secret room.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu sat cross-legged and used the Dao Body Puppet Technique to extract the strand of soul he had previously cut from the first-grade upper-rank puppet beast.</p><p></p><p>He then fused it into the Dragon Alligator puppet beast's body.</p><p></p><p>At the moment of fusion, Su Yu felt a ferocious demonic aura assaulting him.</p><p></p><p>Kill! Kill! Kill!</p><p></p><p>That ferocious, violent, and wild aura madly invaded Su Yu's strand of soul.</p><p></p><p>This was one of the dangers of practicing the Dao Body Puppet Technique.</p><p></p><p>The material of the puppet beast would affect the fused strand of soul, and over time, it could potentially change the host's state of mind.</p><p></p><p>However, at the moment the Dragon Alligator puppet beast's ferocious aura attacked, Su Yu employed the Golden Cicada Technique.</p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Su Yu's strand of soul transformed into a golden cicada pupa.</p><p></p><p>The brilliant golden light illuminated the entire Dragon Alligator puppet beast.</p><p></p><p>It took nearly a day for Su Yu to eliminate the remaining demonic ferocity, which made it easier for his strand of soul to fuse with the Dragon Alligator puppet beast when practicing the Dao Body Puppet Technique.</p><p></p><p>On the third day, as the aura around the Dragon Alligator puppet beast changed, the originally three-zhang tall puppet beast that resembled a ferocious dragon gradually transformed.</p><p></p><p>With the Dao Body Puppet Technique in effect, the Dragon Alligator puppet beast, accompanied by a flash of light, took the form of a Dao Body puppet that looked exactly like Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu admired it for a moment. If the Dao Body puppet's body was not damaged, even Suzhi and the others might not be able to tell that it was just a puppet.</p><p></p><p>There was still no news of the family master Su Peng and the fourth elder Su Jingbang's breakthroughs. Su Yu pondered for a moment while looking at the Dao Body puppet in front of him.</p><p></p><p>After the auction, he now only had about two thousand five hundred lower-grade spirit stones left.</p><p></p><p>Those twenty mid-grade spirit stones needed to be kept for the Dragon Alligator puppet beast, in case of emergencies.</p><p></p><p>As for the more than two thousand lower-grade spirit stones, they might only be enough for him to cultivate for a little over a year. This was just the normal consumption, not including his side occupationsâ€”</p><p></p><p>The Earth Fire Ape and Black Scale Falcon, two second-grade early stage demonic beasts he was taming, and a new earth-attribute skill he was cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Including the normal cultivation of the Willow Wood Cycle Skill, the Alligator Demon's One Hundred and Eight Body Refining Techniques, pill refining, talisman drawing, and continuing to study puppet beasts, and so on.</p><p></p><p>There were too many places that required spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"The first-grade upper-rank puppet beast I have can probably sell for two or three thousand lower-grade spirit stones," Su Yu thought to himself. "Besides that, if I really lack money, I could perhaps sell a Foundation Establishment Pill."</p><p></p><p>"However, now that I have created the Dragon Alligator puppet beast, and have the Earth Fire Ape and Black Scale Falcon as second-grade early stage demonic beasts, as well as second-grade lower-rank talismans."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I could try taking on some second-grade lower-rank pill refining jobs?"</p><p></p><p>As he thought about it, Su Yu slightly frowned. If that was the case, it might be better to just open another pill shop?</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>However, if he opened it himself, the risk would be a bit high. Being at the Qi Refining realm was too eye-catching and would arouse jealousy from others. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, an image floated into Su Yu's mind, and the frown on his brow immediately smoothed out, revealing a hint of joy.</p><p></p><p>"Opening it myself would be too conspicuous, but if I partner with the Yu Family - no, more accurately, partner with Yu Ke'er, and then let the 'Yu Family' name be at the forefront, hmm." The more Su Yu thought about it, the more appropriate it seemed.</p><p></p><p>If he could open an elixir pavilion, he might be able to earn a stable income of five to six thousand low-grade spirit stones per year in Bai Yue Immortal City.  </p><p></p><p>Of course, this included the elixir orders Yu Ke'er had previously given him.</p><p></p><p>With this income, he could support himself comfortably in Bai Yue Immortal City to continue cultivating without having to struggle.</p><p></p><p>The only issue was how to convince Yu Ke'er.</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu invited Yu Ke'er over as a guest. It had been some time since they last met, and Yu Ke'er's face showed a hint of weariness, with traces of wrinkles on her forehead, though not obvious.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Yu has been very busy lately?" Su Yu asked, slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Yu Ke'er gently shook her head, took a sip of the spirit tea Su Yu handed her, but didn't respond. She just quietly drank her tea, seeming to enjoy the tranquility of the courtyard that allowed her heart to calm down.</p><p></p><p>After a while.</p><p></p><p>Yu Ke'er finally looked at Su Yu and said, "You're not the type to casually invite people over for idle chatter. Out with it, what's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Yu just smiled, for he had a thick enough face.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu said, "Are you interested in partnering to open an elixir pavilion? Right here in Bai Yue Immortal City."</p><p></p><p>"I'm not interested," Yu Ke'er shook her head at first, but then paused. She gazed silently at Su Yu for a moment, her mind racing with many thoughts, even guessing Su Yu's intention behind those words.</p><p></p><p>If it were anyone else, Yu Ke'er might have turned and left without a second thought.</p><p></p><p>But as she looked at Su Yu's handsome face that hadn't changed in dozens of years, she fell silent for a while.</p><p></p><p>Yu Ke'er said, "How did you plan to open it?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu tried proposing a 70/30 partnership split, already prepared for Yu Ke'er to counter-offer, with a 50/50 split being his bottom line.</p><p></p><p>However, Yu Ke'er shook her head and said, "A 90/10 split, with you taking 90 and me 10. It can be opened under my name."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu stared at Yu Ke'er in a daze.  </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yu Ke'er smiled charmingly and said, "It's rare to find an opportunity to make you owe me a favor, so let's do it this way."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu remained silent for a long while, but eventually shook his head and said, "Let's do 70/30 instead, otherwise I won't feel at ease."</p><p></p><p>Yu Ke'er looked at Su Yu for a moment, then nodded lightly without arguing further. Instead, she brought up matters like the Spiritual Void Fruit and so on.</p><p></p><p>After chatting idly for a while, Yu Ke'er finally left.</p><p></p><p>As she was leaving, Yu Ke'er took it upon herself to handle matters like choosing the elixir pavilion's location and so on. The premises would count as her investment into the partnership.</p><p></p><p>After Yu Ke'er left, Su Yu gently frowned, unsure whether opening this elixir pavilion was a good or bad thing.</p><p></p><p>He roughly understood Yu Ke'er's intentions, but he didn't have those kinds of thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how it goes. As long as there are no issues, the elixir pavilion can keep operating. But if..." Su Yu sighed lightly, wondering if continuing that line of thought would make him a scoundrel.</p><p></p><p>Pah, he was completely pure and upright.</p><p></p><p>Although this Miss Yu Ke'er of the Yu Family's main lineage was quite exceptional, at least a nine out of ten.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head to dispel the jumbled thoughts, a smile appeared on Su Yu's face: "With a stable income secured, I can cultivate steadily from now on."</p><p></p><p>P.S. In the early stages of the Five Phase cultivation method, without techniques that integrate the spiritual root attributes, one can only cultivate them slowly one by one.</p><p></p><p>The integration will happen in the later storyline developments, eventually unifying the Five Phases.</p><p></p><p>As for the family aspect, the karmic ties of familial affection and bloodline can be maintained for a few generations.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, there are no plans to take a wife for now.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>Seeking monthly tickets and recommendation tickets.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

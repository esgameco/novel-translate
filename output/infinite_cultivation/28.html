        <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Lower and middle-grade magic treasures are suitable for the Qi Refining realm, top-grade magic treasures are suitable for the Foundation Establishment realm, while supreme-grade magic treasures correspond to the level of Pill Formation Immortals. </p><p></p><p>Although the Tian Luo Umbrella was only a remnant of a supreme-grade magic treasure, for a late Foundation Establishment cultivator, it was a priceless treasure.</p><p></p><p>It was a priceless treasure that the demonic cultivator Blood Saber Luo Bang dared to venture into the Yunshan Market Town to seize by force.</p><p></p><p>"The person who previously tried to snatch the Foundation Establishment Pill was probably the bandit cultivator 'Ghost-Headed Golden Eagle', who cultivates metallic spiritual power and is extremely powerful with vicious methods," said Su Yun, finally breathing a sigh of relief after Blood Saber Luo Bang escaped the market town.</p><p></p><p>He mentioned the person who previously tried to take the Foundation Establishment Pill.</p><p></p><p>Su Yun's expression turned grave as he said, "But as far as I know, the 'Ghost-Headed Golden Eagle' has been active around Baiyue Immortal City and rarely appears in our area."</p><p></p><p>"There's no reason for him to come to an unfamiliar place like this just for an auction at a Yunshan merchant group."</p><p></p><p>Unable to understand the situation, Su Yun asked Su Yu to go out less often recently.</p><p></p><p>As for the Foundation Establishment Pill, Su Yun did not plan to send it back to the Jiang City Cangshan Family.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he notified the family to select someone who wished to take the Foundation Establishment Pill and attempt to break through to the Foundation Establishment realm, and have them come to the Yunshan Market Town.</p><p></p><p>They could take advantage of the spiritual energy from the second-grade spirit vein core in the central area of Yunshan Market Town, as well as its defenses, to attempt the breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, before the family members arrived at Yunshan Market Town, news of bandit cultivators appearing and killing cultivators frequently spread from outside the town.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that many bandit cultivators had come to the area around Yunshan Market Town, causing anxiety among the merchants and cultivators in the town.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, not long after, several Foundation Establishment cultivators from the Yunxian Sect took action, leading outer and inner sect disciples to patrol the area and hunt down the bandit cultivators, restoring peace and order around Yunshan Market Town.</p><p></p><p>However, this had little to do with Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>Su Yun was preparing for the family's decision on who would attempt to break through to the Foundation Establishment realm, being extremely cautious about it.</p><p></p><p>After returning, Su Yu took out the egg of the congenitally deficient Earth Fire Ape demonic beast and examined it.</p><p></p><p>"To hatch it, apart from allowing it to absorb the spiritual energy from spirit stones, I can also infuse it with spiritual power to aid its growth and hatching," said Su Yu with some anticipation, as the Earth Fire Ape's bloodline was passable.</p><p></p><p>At least within the scope of the Yunxian Sect, it was acceptable.</p><p></p><p>Although it couldn't compare to the demonic beast pet with a great demon bloodline from his previous cultivation game.</p><p></p><p>But after all, this was still the early stages—</p><p></p><p>Or one could say, the beginner village stage.</p><p></p><p>If he could have an Earth Fire Ape beast companion, the days he spent cultivating in the Pill Pavilion wouldn't be so boring.</p><p></p><p>Taking it out would also be quite stylish.</p><p></p><p>However, the prerequisite was that he could control the ferocious Earth Fire Ape.</p><p></p><p>He tried infusing his spiritual power into the demonic beast egg, which was a full foot in size. The egg was entirely red, like a huge ruby, but its surface was covered with vein-like patterns.</p><p></p><p>He could still sense the vigorous life force and the scorching aura of the Earth Fire Ape bloodline from within.</p><p></p><p>The moment Su Yu's spiritual power from the Qingmu Suizhuan Art entered the demonic beast egg, the egg trembled slightly, and an instant later, a faint suction force came from within the egg.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to eagerly want to absorb Su Yu's spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Through the Qingmu Suizhuan Art's keen perception of life force, Su Yu was surprised to find that this unborn Earth Fire Ape craved his spiritual power intensely, and he could vaguely sense its immature consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"I... I want to drink."</p><p></p><p>After infusing sixty percent of his spiritual power, Su Yu stopped.</p><p></p><p>He never depleted all of his spiritual power, even when safely inside the Pill Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Depleting his spiritual power would be very dangerous, leaving him to rely solely on body cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>It would give him an extreme sense of insecurity.</p><p></p><p>Consuming sixty percent of his spiritual power while retaining forty percent was just the right amount.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu sensed joy from the immature consciousness within the Earth Fire Ape demonic beast egg, chirping happily.</p><p></p><p>The scorching aura from the egg also seemed to have grown stronger.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This went on for several consecutive days. Every day, Su Yu infused the spirit eggs of the Earth Fire Ape demonic beasts with spiritual power, incubating them. To her surprise, she discovered that the spirit eggs of some Earth Fire Ape demonic beasts that were originally slightly weaker in their innate spiritual aura seemed to have recovered to normal levels. </p><p></p><p>Their auras were even growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later.</p><p></p><p>The great elder Su Mengshan and the fifth elder Su Bin of the Su Family arrived at Yunshan Town. </p><p></p><p>Originally, Su Yu thought the one taking the Foundation Establishment Pill would be the great elder or the family master, but unexpectedly it turned out to be the fifth elder Su Bin.</p><p></p><p>Su Bin's cultivation level was not the seventh level of Qi Refining as he portrayed, but rather the ninth level of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>The Foundation Establishment Pill was handed over to Su Bin, and the great elder Su Mengshan accompanied Su Bin to the core area of the town to rent a cave abode.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Yu's slightly surprised look, Su Yun said, "The fifth elder was once the most talented genius in our Su Family. He reached the ninth level of Qi Refining before the age of forty."</p><p></p><p>"However, there was a mishap later on, and it was very difficult for the family to collect Foundation Establishment Pills, which delayed his progress."</p><p></p><p>"Having the fifth elder attempt to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm is the best choice."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Su Yu found this reasoning sound.</p><p></p><p>Although the family master Su Peng, the great elder Su Mengshan, and the second elder Su Yun were all at the ninth level of Qi Refining, the great elder Su Mengshan was too old, nearing a hundred years of age.</p><p></p><p>Even though he cultivated the Willow Green Wood Mantra, which could extend his lifespan by twenty years, he was already elderly.</p><p></p><p>Taking a flawed Foundation Establishment Pill, his chances of successfully breaking through were not high.</p><p></p><p>The family master Su Peng's age was still acceptable, not yet sixty, still in his prime years. However, the current family situation was not ideal.</p><p></p><p>If he failed to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, it would inevitably cause severe damage to his spiritual roots, which would affect the entire Su Family.</p><p></p><p>So the family master Su Peng was not a suitable candidate for the time being.</p><p></p><p>As for the second elder Su Yun—</p><p></p><p>His long-term pill refining had weakened his combat prowess. Even if Su Yun broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, his contribution to the Su Family would not surpass that of the fifth elder Su Bin.</p><p></p><p>What the current Su Family needed was a powerful Foundation Establishment cultivator!</p><p></p><p>While the fifth elder Su Bin went to the core area of the town to attempt his breakthrough to the Foundation Establishment Realm, Su Yu successfully hatched the Earth Fire Ape cubs in the Pill Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>For this, she even went to the Heavenly Book Pavilion to purchase a beast taming technique and completed the master recognition ritual with the Earth Fire Ape cubs.</p><p></p><p>Unlike ordinary Earth Fire Apes, these cubs hatched from the spirit eggs that had undergone the baptism of Su Yu's Willow Wood Cycle spiritual power were not as violently aggressive. Their teary, wide eyes were as clear as red gemstones.</p><p></p><p>The occasional flashes of spiritual light showed that these little ones were quite intelligent.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they hatched from the spirit eggs, they opened their eyes wide, toddled over to Su Yu, hugged her legs, trying to climb into her embrace, and let out adorable cries.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Earth Fire Ape cubs being born, the usually serious Su Yun rarely showed a smile, happily clapping his hands, "Second-grade demonic beast bloodline!"</p><p></p><p>"Nurture it well, and it will become your greatest assistance in the future!"</p><p></p><p>"Likewise, if it grows into a second-grade demonic beast, it will also become the strongest guardian beast of the Su Family."</p><p></p><p>At least, that was how Su Yun saw it.</p><p></p><p>Delighted, Su Yun tossed a first-grade low-rank Beast Pill to the Earth Fire Ape cub.</p><p></p><p>This pill was refined using demonic beast essence blood as the main ingredient, serving as food and cultivation resources for beast tamers and their beasts.</p><p></p><p>PS: Correcting some earlier character name errors.</p><p></p><p>The one in charge of the Su Family's main clan affairs is the great elder: Su Mengshan.</p><p></p><p>The one in charge of the Yunshan Town's Pill Pavilion is the second elder: Su Yun. </p><p></p><p>The one in charge of the medicine garden is the third elder: Su Chang.</p><p></p><p>The fourth elder is Su Ruosu.</p><p></p><p>The fifth elder is Su Bin.</p><p></p><p>If there are any other inconsistencies, please leave a comment so the author can correct them when possible.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 66</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He turned his spiritual sense towards the cultivation level panel, where the information had changed greatly overnight.</p><p></p><p>【Name: Su Yu】</p><p>【Cultivation Realm: Ninth Layer of Qi Refining】  </p><p>【Lifespan: 45/164】</p><p>【Cultivation Techniques: Qingmu Suixuan Gong (One Cycle Nine Rotations, Proficiency 25.94%), Xuanming Hoututu (Sixth Layer, Proficiency 87.44%), Emosutra's 108 Body Refining Techniques (Tenth Layer, Proficiency 19.87%), Blood Whale Devouring Moon Technique (Second Realm, Proficiency 10%), Golden Cicada Technique (Second Layer, Proficiency 4.66%)】</p><p>【Spells: Wood Vine Technique (Mastered), Spirit Nurturing Technique (Mastered), Spirit Javelin Technique (Mastered), Spirit Storing Technique (Mastered), Earth Escape Technique (Mastered), Xuanming Armor Technique (Mastered), Earth Dragon Skyoverturning Technique (Proficiency 43.17%), Xuanming Dragon Locking Technique (Proficiency 23.42%)】</p><p></p><p>"Forty-five years old, it has been twenty-nine years since I was eliminated from Cloudswod Sect and began cultivating." Su Yu sighed inwardly, "My cultivation has finally advanced to the ninth layer of the Qi Refining Realm."</p><p></p><p>Seeing his lifespan of 164 years at the ninth layer of Qi Refining Realm below, Su Yu's eyes focused intently.</p><p></p><p>After carefully examining his body again, the Qingmu Suixuan Gong that had reached one cycle and nine rotations, the annual ring that had undergone nine transformations was engraved more and more deeply within his body.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, there was an elusive aura of the annual ring's breath.</p><p></p><p>It was very faint, very faint.</p><p></p><p>But with this breath existing, it allowed him to slightly resist the erosion of the long river of time.</p><p></p><p>This might be one of the fundamental reasons why the Qingmu Suixuan Gong was superior to the Wutong Qingmu Sutra in extending longevity.</p><p></p><p>"Even though I'm forty-five now, if calculated carefully, I still have 119 years of lifespan remaining." Su Yu pondered silently, "And this doesn't account for my continued cultivation advancement."</p><p></p><p>"As long as there are no accidents, breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm definitely won't be a problem."</p><p></p><p>In theory, for the Qingmu Suixuan Gong to advance to the second cycle first rotation, it would probably take around six more years.</p><p></p><p>But this didn't factor in the effect of the second layer of the Golden Cicada Technique.</p><p></p><p>With the Golden Cicada Technique, he might only need a little over four years, not even five, for the proficiency to increase and break through.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanming Hoututu's advancement this time was also considerable, going from the fourth to the sixth layer, with the proficiency reaching 87.44%. It was estimated that in just two to three months, it could break through again to the seventh layer.</p><p></p><p>If it reached the seventh layer, with his earth spiritual root at the seventh layer of Qi Refining Realm, then Su Yu's use of earth-attribute spells would be able to provide him some assistance.</p><p></p><p>The eight new earth-attribute spells he had cultivated could then be put to use.</p><p></p><p>The sun rose in the east, and birds chirped merrily as they hopped onto the branches in the rear courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The Wutong Danfang opened for business, and the two attendants, Yu Shuan and Yu Er, summoned the workers to look after the pill furnace, counting the remaining spirit pill and spirit herb inventory, as well as checking the orders for outsourced pill refinement and making arrangements.</p><p></p><p>These two were first-rank middle-grade pill refiners, one named Xu Desheng, sixty-nine years old, and the other named Kang Yunian, seventy-one years old.</p><p></p><p>With the two of them managing the pill furnace, Su Yu did not need to handle everything himself and could have free time to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>In the rear courtyard,</p><p></p><p>After spending over two hours refining the required spirit pills for the day, Su Yu delivered the pills, then returned to the pill refinement room in his rear courtyard residence and began his daily cultivation routine, first cultivating the Qingmu Suixuan Gong as always.</p><p></p><p>"Hum!"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu consumed a perfect-quality first-rank upper-grade Qi Refining Pill and circulated his cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a vague ancient wood aura permeating the air.</p><p></p><p>The cross-legged Su Yu seemed to transform into an ancient towering tree rooted in the earth.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's Golden Cicada Technique circulated, his soul manifesting as a golden cicada pupa in his mind's realm, bathed in a faint golden radiance that made his whole body feel ethereal and unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>Within his body, his spiritual power, boosted by the effects of the perfect-quality first-rank upper-grade Qi Refining Pill, circulated at an accelerated rate.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>His cultivation speed had increased by more than 10%, and now, under the influence of the Golden Cicada Technique, this speed further increased by a full 20%. </p><p></p><p>"Hu hu hu!"</p><p></p><p>The spiritual qi of heaven and earth with a second-grade spiritual vein concentration from all directions gathered into the Pill Refining Room under the attraction of the Qi Gathering Array, gushing into Su Yu's body and being refined into Wood Spiritual Power by him.</p><p></p><p>This movement was much larger than his previous cultivation. </p><p></p><p>Strands of spiritual power condensed and were born, continuously strengthening Su Yu's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The proficiency of the Cyan Wood Yearly Cycle Technique also gradually increased during this cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After about an hour and a half, Su Yu felt a sense of stagnation. He then stopped circulating the Cyan Wood Yearly Cycle Technique and slowly withdrew from the cultivation state, exhaling a breath of cyan aura.</p><p></p><p>In his dantian, the newly condensed Wood Spiritual Power was slowly integrating, reaching its limit for today.</p><p></p><p>Haste makes waste.</p><p></p><p>This newborn spiritual power still needed time to slowly integrate and be controlled, not growing wildly.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the proficiency panel.</p><p></p><p>[Technique: Cyan Wood Yearly Cycle Technique (One Cycle Nine Rotations, Proficiency 25.99%).]</p><p></p><p>"In one day, the proficiency can increase by about 0.045%," Su Yu pondered.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, it would probably increase by about 17% in a year.</p><p></p><p>This was about what he had expected. It would take a little less than five years for the Cyan Wood Yearly Cycle Technique's proficiency to reach the Second Cycle First Rotation realm, and his cultivation to reach the first level of the Foundation Establishment Stage.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this speed was premised on having perfect quality first-grade upper-rank Qi Refining Pills and the assistance of the second layer of the Golden Cicada Technique.</p><p></p><p>"This should be comparable to the cultivation speed of a cultivator with a middle-grade spiritual root, or even the upper-middle among those," Su Yu inwardly rejoiced. The Golden Cicada Technique was truly a heaven-defying opportunity; the second layer was even more formidable.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the thoughts in his mind, Su Yu took out a drop of second-grade middle-rank demonic beast essence blood from his qiankun bag, swallowed it, and began cultivating the Alligator One Hundred and Eight Form Body Refining Technique.</p><p></p><p>Under the influence of the second layer of the Golden Cicada Technique, the speed of body refining cultivation also increased by 20%.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>In the late afternoon, two people came to the Pill Pavilion's entrance. After verifying their identities, Xu Desheng hurriedly went to the back courtyard to call Su Yu out.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu came to the Pill Pavilion and saw a man who appeared to be in his thirties with a beard, an extraordinary bearing with a hint of majesty, accompanied by an attendant who looked about fifty or sixty years older than him, standing quietly in the store.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing this man, Su Yu's expression turned solemn. Although the man had concealed his aura, Su Yu could still see through his cultivation level with his divine sense and perception.</p><p></p><p>The first level of the Foundation Establishment Stage.</p><p></p><p>His age was definitely not the thirty-odd years his appearance suggested.</p><p></p><p>While Su Yu was observing the other party, the man was also observing Su Yu. He seemed somewhat surprised and astonished for a moment before saying, "I've heard that there is a new Wutong Pill Pavilion in the market town, and the quality of the pills they refine is all superb."</p><p></p><p>"And inside the Pill Pavilion, there is even a second-grade lower-rank Pill Refiner presiding. Could it be you, Daoist friend?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu pondered and nodded, "You have met me. If there is no other Wutong Pill Pavilion, then it should be me."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Su Yu looked at the man and said, "I wonder if the Executor Daoist is from the True Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"To reach the ninth level of the Qi Condensation Realm and become a second-grade lower-rank Pill Refiner, and even refine renowned second-grade lower-rank pills of superb quality." This man praised Su Yu, "Daoist friend's talent in pill refining is truly extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>Then, this man candidly said, "My name is Hu Xiu, an Executor of the True Sect founded by the Third Prince of Baiyue Immortal City, also a second-grade lower-rank Pill Refiner."</p><p></p><p>"This time, I have come to invite Daoist friend to join the True Sect."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

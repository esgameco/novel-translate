        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Three months later.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu gained an entry-level understanding of pill refining and successfully refined a first-grade low-rank qi-refining pill. His success rate was over 30%, meeting the entry standard for a first-grade low-rank pill refiner.  </p><p></p><p>Two streets away from the Pill Pavilion, there was a magnificent restaurant on the second floor where Su Zhi hosted a banquet to entertain Su Qingyi and Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>Two other entry-level disciples from the Cloud Sword Sect also appeared, a male and a female. They joined later than Su Zhi, so they were considered her junior martial brothers and sisters.  </p><p></p><p>Compared to over two years ago, Su Zhi's cultivation had reached the seventh level of the Qi Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the two entry-level Cloud Sword Sect disciples, their cultivation levels were at the fifth level of the Qi Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>Su Qingyi drank a sip of wine with a bit of dejection and said, "Although Brother Yu's cultivation talent is a bit lacking, his pill refining talent is shockingly high. The Second Elder was quite startled by his pill refining talent and has been overjoyed these past few days."</p><p></p><p>"Just three months, a mere three months, and Brother Yu has truly gained entry into pill refining and become a first-grade low-rank pill refiner."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the two Cloud Sword Sect disciples who originally weren't too interested in Su Qingyi and Su Yu suddenly looked at Su Yu with surprise.</p><p></p><p>One must not underestimate the status of pill refiners in the cultivation world!</p><p></p><p>Although only a first-grade low-rank pill refiner, to the entry-level Cloud Sword Sect disciples who had just reached the fifth level of the Qi Refining Realm, he was still someone they needed to respect.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, this was a talent who became a first-grade low-rank pill refiner in just three short months.</p><p></p><p>Su Qingyi came to Cloud Mountain Town a year earlier than Su Yu, and his cultivation was also at the fifth level of the Qi Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>But after that year, he still hadn't grasped the essence of pill refining and remained only a pill refining apprentice until now.</p><p></p><p>Normally, it should take a pill refining apprentice two to three years to become a true first-grade pill refiner.</p><p></p><p>If one couldn't become a first-grade pill refiner within three years, then their talent was lacking, and they might as well give up early.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Zhi's beautiful eyes looked at her clan junior Su Yu with surprise, but then she hesitated.</p><p></p><p>A talented pill refiner, yet his father had said he planned to cultivate him to see if he could inherit and support the family, but his cultivation was a bit lacking...</p><p></p><p>Should she bring along such a clan junior on an adventure?</p><p></p><p>Su Yu waved at Su Qingyi to stop him from continuing. Su Qingyi's words didn't stem from jealousy or belittling him.</p><p></p><p>Rather, it was because the two entry-level Cloud Sword Sect disciples brought by the Young Lady looked at them with a slightly disdainful and arrogant attitude.</p><p></p><p>But after mentioning that Su Yu became a true pill refiner in just three months, their gazes towards him changed, now filled with enough respect and enthusiasm.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu looked towards the two of them. The male was named Li Shinan, quite handsome and rumored to be the son of a secular royal family.</p><p></p><p>The female was named Chen Sisi, with an eight out of ten appearance, especially a pair of charming eyes, though her temperament was more like an iceberg.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu smiled and asked, "Sister, what is your mission to advance to an inner sect disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi hesitated for a moment before replying, "To hunt and kill a late first-grade Zuo Shan Diao (Seated Mountain Eagle)."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, both Su Qingyi and Su Yu's expressions turned solemn. The Zuo Shan Diao was a famous vicious demonic beast with some intelligence.  </p><p></p><p>The Yu Family of the Black Rock Mountain was first renowned for taming the Zuo Shan Diao as their spirit beast. Later, they even produced an early second-grade Zuo Shan Diao, allowing the Yu Family to achieve a realm elevation for a cultivation family and have several clan members break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm.</p><p></p><p>Hunting the Zuo Shan Diao was extremely difficult, not only because of its powerful demonic bloodline but also due to its alertness and tendency to flee at the first sign of danger.</p><p></p><p>It was a demonic beast after all. Even with flying treasures, cultivators couldn't catch up to its speed.</p><p></p><p>However, this mission to advance to the inner sect had to be completed.  </p><p></p><p>Once Su Zhi became an inner sect disciple of the Cloud Sword Sect, the resources she could access would greatly increase.</p><p></p><p>With Su Zhi's talent, she had a great chance of successfully establishing her cultivation base in the future.</p><p></p><p>Whether one became an inner sect disciple a year earlier or later made a huge difference.</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi said, "I can bring along four..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"A cultivator at the fifth level of Qi Refining Realm or below will join me to complete the mission, while I, a late-stage Realm Transformation cultivator, have already found the precise location of a Zuo Shan Diao (a type of ferocious spirit bird). I'm just waiting to go over there."</p><p></p><p>"If we can hunt down the Zuo Shan Diao, I only want its head. The rest of the spoils will be divided among you four." </p><p></p><p>"I'll also provide twelve high-grade Qi Refining Pills of the first grade."</p><p></p><p>Low-grade first grade Qi Refining Pills are inexpensive, costing only one low-grade spirit stone each.</p><p></p><p>High-grade first grade Qi Refining Pills are much more expensive, costing more than ten low-grade spirit stones each. They are considered excellent cultivation resources for mid and late-stage Qi Refining cultivators.</p><p></p><p>After some hesitation, Su Yu still agreed.</p><p></p><p>This was not because of those resources, but because Su Zhi's promotion to an inner disciple would benefit him and the Su Family.</p><p></p><p>He had to help with this task.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with his temperament, he would rather cultivate in the market town until reaching the ninth level of the Qi Refining Realm, or even breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm before going out.</p><p></p><p>Li Shinan and Chen Sisi both readily agreed as well, not for the resources either.</p><p></p><p>But as an investment.</p><p></p><p>If their Senior Sister Su Zhi could become an inner disciple, she would be able to look out for them in the Cloud Sword Sect to some extent.</p><p></p><p>Li Shinan looked at Su Yu and said enthusiastically, "Brother Yu, don't worry. Once we encounter the Zuo Shan Diao, I will protect you at that time and won't let you get hurt."</p><p></p><p>They agreed to meet outside the Outer Sect's mountain gate of the Cloud Sword Sect in three days. Su Zhi and the other two left.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu bid farewell to Su Qingyi and pondered his current foundation.</p><p></p><p>His proficiency in the Alligator Demon's 108 Body Refining Techniques had reached 93%, not far from breaking through to the sixth level.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Su Zhi not being able to bring someone at the sixth level of Qi Refining to help complete the mission, he would have preferred to break through to the sixth level of the Body Refining Techniques before participating in hunting the Zuo Shan Diao.</p><p></p><p>The Cyan Wood Cycle Cultivation Art had reached the fourth turn of its cycle, equivalent to the fourth level of the Qi Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although his spiritual power was not strong, he excelled in endurance and healing injuries.</p><p></p><p>He had a low-grade magic weapon, the Crimson Luo Blade, which could pierce armor and deal damage to the Zuo Shan Diao.</p><p></p><p>"I still have more than eight hundred low-grade spirit stones on hand."</p><p></p><p>"I should go buy a magic armor as well."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu thought quietly. He cared most about his own safety. In the past, he didn't go out or fight, so it didn't matter. But now that he had to face a late-stage Realm Transformation ferocious spirit bird, he felt uneasy.</p><p></p><p>After calculating his foundation, Su Yu hurried to the trading firm operated by the Cloud Sword Sect in the market town.</p><p></p><p>After careful selection, he chose a mid-grade magic armor, the Azure Skylight Magic Robe, worth two hundred and thirty low-grade spirit stones. It had a defensive array formation installed, and in critical moments, it could activate an Azure Skylight Shield, at least capable of withstanding one or two strikes from a late-stage Realm Transformation demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>He also got a set of five low-grade magic weapons called the Ice Soul Needles, which formed an ensemble. Once the Ice Soul Needles entered the body, they had freezing and slowing effects.</p><p></p><p>Such magic weapons like the Ice Soul Needles excelled at piercing armor.</p><p></p><p>If the Ice Soul Needles could enter the body, Su Yu could also use them as a medium to cast the Life Devouring Spell.</p><p></p><p>Even if he couldn't absorb the target's life force, it would greatly deplete their spiritual power, mental energy, and so on.</p><p></p><p>The set cost one hundred and eighty low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Apart from magic weapons, Su Yu also purchased some high-grade first grade talisman papers from the trading firm: two Golden Light Talisman defensive talismans, two Divine Speed Talisman acceleration talismans, and two Cloud-Piercing Arrow attack talismans, spending one hundred and ninety low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go back and refine these two magic weapons, then adjust my state."</p><p></p><p>It was his first time going out to hunt in the wild, and Su Yu felt a bit nervous, so he converted most of his spirit stones into means of increasing his strength.</p><p></p><p>However, if Su Zhi and the others knew about his preparations, they would probably be shocked.</p><p></p><p>This was too 'extravagant.'</p><p></p><p>P.S. I was too tired the past two days, so I slept half the day yesterday to recover. I just woke up in the middle of the night, so I hurried to write another chapter. I plan to update three more chapters tomorrow. Please give me some monthly votes.</p>

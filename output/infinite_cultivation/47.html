        <h1>Chapter 47</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Su Dajun said, "Previously, the Huang Family of Guanlan Mountain has already lost an elder at the Foundation Establishment realm. Although the Huang Family's power is quite formidable, now that the Chen Family and the Su Family have joined forces, both families are not weak either."  </p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, the Huang Family and the Bai Family don't have a particularly close relationship. Although the Purple Gold Sand Spirit Mine has some value, it's not to the extent that the Huang Family would go to any lengths to deal with the Chen Family and our family."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu pondered this carefully, and indeed it was true.</p><p></p><p>The Huang Family of Guanlan Mountain was powerful, but that didn't mean it could act recklessly against other cultivator families. </p><p></p><p>That would provoke wariness from other cultivator families.</p><p></p><p>And if the Huang Family's strength was severely damaged, then all the resource areas occupied by the Huang Family would become ripe for the picking.</p><p></p><p>Once it provoked the greed of other powers, the Huang Family could even face the crisis of being wiped out.</p><p></p><p>Losing one Foundation Establishment elder was already painful enough for the Huang Family.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation world was never lacking in struggles and conflicts, especially among cultivator families.</p><p></p><p>But if these struggles and conflicts were viewed in the context of a cultivator's long lifespan, one could see that some conflicts were not actually that intense, and usually just went so far and no further.</p><p></p><p>Unless they had sufficient assurance of victory, they would absolutely not "go all out."</p><p></p><p>Just like the previous situation between the Su Family and the Lin Family.</p><p></p><p>Why didn't the Su Family settle scores with the Lin Family before the Fifth Elder Su Bin broke through to the Foundation Establishment realm?</p><p></p><p>Because compared to the Su Family at that time, the Lin Family's strength was more or less evenly matched.</p><p></p><p>If the Foundation Establishment realm was not reached, and the Su Family clashed head-on with the Lin Family, even if the Su Family ultimately won, they would still lose - they would absolutely suffer devastating losses!</p><p></p><p>Only after the Fifth Elder Su Bin broke through to the Foundation Establishment realm did the Su Family take action against the Lin Family, wiping out their entire clan.</p><p></p><p>It's not that they didn't want revenge for grievances, it was just that the time wasn't right yet.</p><p></p><p>Standing in the cultivation world, only by being sufficiently cautious could one make it to the end.</p><p></p><p>Whether for an individual cultivator, or for a sect's power or a cultivator family, it was the same.</p><p></p><p>Because for arrogant individuals and powers, even if they didn't die today, they would die tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>Obviously.</p><p></p><p>The Huang Family of Guanlan Mountain was cautious, and did not further interfere in the matters of the Bai Family of Maple City and the Purple Gold Sand Spirit Mine.</p><p></p><p>The Chen Family and the Su Family had only seized one of the Bai Family's resource areas in Maple City, and did not continue to oppress the Bai Family further.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Bai Family still had an elder at the third level of the Foundation Establishment realm, who could at least live for another thirty or forty years.</p><p></p><p>Plus, with the Bai Family's foundation, the two families basically had no hope of wiping them out.</p><p></p><p>They could only slowly make their moves.</p><p></p><p>Wait until the Bai Family's third level Foundation Establishment elder passed away, wait until the Bai Family had no successors, then that would be the time for the Chen Family and Su Family to wipe out the Bai Family and completely take their revenge.</p><p></p><p>Su Dajun soon led his team to leave Cloud Mountain Town and return to River City.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu continued to focus on studying second-grade low-rank pill refinement. Apart from Foundation Establishment pill ingredients being monopolized by various major powers and being basically impossible to collect, gathering ingredients for other second-grade low-rank pills was not too difficult.</p><p></p><p>First improve his own second-grade low-rank pill refinement skills. In the future, once he collected enough Foundation Establishment pill ingredients, it wouldn't be too late to attempt refining Foundation Establishment pills.</p><p></p><p>He personally did not need any Foundation Establishment pills.</p><p></p><p>But if he could refine them, and had sufficient Foundation Establishment pill ingredients, then refining them to enhance the Su Family's strength would be quite good.</p><p></p><p>Or alternatively, if he could refine Foundation Establishment pills, then after going to Worship Moon Immortal City, he could quickly establish a firm foothold there.</p><p></p><p>Foundation Establishment pills were very precious, enough for him to exchange for many resources and materials.</p><p></p><p>Another year later.</p><p></p><p>Chen Sisi sent a letter saying she had successfully broken through to the Foundation Establishment realm. After secluded cultivation for a period of time, she would choose to go to the Cloud Sword Sect's branch in Worship Moon Immortal City to take up residence.</p><p></p><p>As for holding a banquet to celebrate breaking through to the Foundation Establishment realm, she would not, only sending letters to inform her friends and fellow cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The letter was quite long, with Chen Sisi talking about many things.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, it all came down to one sentence: I'll go to Worship Moon Immortal City first, take care. If you need any help from me, you can ask.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The letter informed him.</p><p></p><p>It is well known that Su Yu has quite a thick skin. </p><p></p><p>Naturally, he would not be polite.</p><p></p><p>He immediately wrote a letter by hand, listing all the second-grade materials he needed, and asked Chen Sisi to pay attention or collect them for him.</p><p></p><p>He would offer a reward.</p><p></p><p>After writing it, he immediately went to the Cloud Sword Sect's base to send it out.</p><p></p><p>"The core materials for the family's Foundation Pill are still lacking three kinds, and most of the materials for refining the second-grade inferior Puppet Beast Dragon Alligator are still lacking."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know how much Su Zhi and Chen Sisi can help me collect."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu slowly took a breath and sighed lightly.</p><p></p><p>The materials for second-grade inferior pills were not difficult to collect and refine, but the materials for second-grade inferior Puppet Beasts were truly expensive and difficult to collect.</p><p></p><p>To refine a second-grade inferior Puppet Beast, he estimated that he would have to spend at least five to six thousand inferior spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>And second-grade inferior Puppet Beasts required at least mid-grade spirit stones to operate.</p><p></p><p>So, he also needed to exchange for some mid-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Puppet Beasts, his progress on second-grade talismans was also slow. Creating a second-grade talisman was far more difficult than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>If the old man from the Heavenly Book Pavilion knew that Su Yu, a mere Qi Refining seventh level cultivator, was trying to create a new second-grade inferior talisman to advance to a second-grade inferior Talisman Master without any Talisman Master inheritance, he would probably be dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>This was even more difficult than a first-grade superior Talisman Master trying to refine a second-grade inferior perfect quality talisman!</p><p></p><p>The peaceful days of cultivation always passed quickly.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's daily routine in the Pill Pavilion did not change at all.</p><p></p><p>Every day, he practiced the Qingmu Suizhou Technique, the Alligator Demon's One Hundred and Eight Body Refining Techniques, and the Golden Cicada Method. Afterward, he would use the near-ethereal state of the Golden Cicada Method to comprehend pill refining, talismans, and puppetry.</p><p></p><p>Finally, more than two years later, Su Yu successfully used an ancient fragmentary Fire Thunder Talisman as a template to create a second-grade inferior talisman.</p><p></p><p>He named it the Thunder Fire Talisman.</p><p></p><p>He had never seen what a real Fire Thunder Talisman looked like.</p><p></p><p>But the Thunder Fire Talisman he successfully drew was like a whip of thunder and fire descending from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>With one strike, it could destroy the peak of a small mountain a hundred zhang tall.</p><p></p><p>It could split half a mountain.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu successfully advanced to become a second-grade inferior Talisman Master.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>Under Su Yu's meticulous guidance, an almost seventy-year-old first-grade mid-rank Pill Refiner named Su Gutong from the Pill Pavilion finally advanced to become a first-grade superior Pill Refiner.</p><p></p><p>And Su Ruian also became a newly advanced first-grade mid-rank Pill Refiner.</p><p></p><p>They did not disappoint Su Yu's efforts.</p><p></p><p>However, the collection of materials for the second-grade inferior Puppet Beast Dragon Alligator was relatively slow, and there were still a few core materials with no news.</p><p></p><p>This made Su Yu consider leaving Yunshan Town for the first time to go to Yuexian City.</p><p></p><p>But before Su Yu could prepare to leave, a shocking piece of news shook the entire Cloud Sword Sect's domain.</p><p></p><p>The Xu Family of Black Rock Mountain and the Huang Family of Guanlan Mountain had gone to war at the Eight Demon Ridge.</p><p></p><p>The reason was that they had discovered a spirit plant tree bearing the Ethereal Fruit, a core material for refining Foundation Pills.</p><p></p><p>The two great cultivator families fought over that one spirit plant tree.</p><p></p><p>When Su Yu heard this news, his heart stirred: "The spirit tree of the Ethereal Fruit?"</p><p></p><p>This was one of the two most core materials among the six core materials for refining Foundation Pills, the other being the pure spirit core of a second-grade demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>The Su Family had never been able to find news of these two materials.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that there would be a tree bearing the Ethereal Fruit in the Eight Demon Ridge!</p><p></p><p>No wonder the two great cultivator families went to war over it!</p><p></p><p>Ps: 100,000 words, a new milestone begins. It's the end of the month, requesting some monthly tickets and recommendation tickets.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

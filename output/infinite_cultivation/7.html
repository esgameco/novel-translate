            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In addition to being able to trade materials from demonic beasts at the trading fairs, they could also be sold to the clan. Although the prices were on the low side, it was convenient and allowed everything to be resolved at once, exchanging them for spirit stones or other resources from the clan.</p><p></p><p>Suyu kept the flesh, blood essence from the mid-stage first-tier demonic rock rat for her own consumption to cultivate body refining techniques. </p><p></p><p>As for the beast hide and the early-stage first-tier demonic rock rat along with its blood essence, she sold those to the clan in exchange for six low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Time passed slowly.</p><p></p><p>After coming to the medicine garden, the cultivation resources in Suyu's hands had increased several times over.</p><p></p><p>She even had forty-one drops of blood essence from the mid-stage first-tier demonic rock rat. </p><p></p><p>It could be described as being 'wealthy and unconstrained'.</p><p></p><p>For daily cultivation, with the help of spirit stones and spirit rice, she now only needed to cultivate the Willow Green Wood Mantra for less than three hours a day to reach the limit.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the body refining technique, she could now refine and consume two drops of demonic beast blood essence per day, achieving a qualitative leap in her cultivation speed.</p><p></p><p>As time went by, a night passed.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Suyu woke up from her cultivation and focused her mind on the lines of proficiency panels in front of her.</p><p></p><p>[Techniques: Willow Green Wood Mantra (Layer 2, 4.5% Proficiency), Crocodile Demon's 108 Body Refining Techniques (Layer 3, 21.4% Proficiency).]</p><p></p><p>"In one day, the Willow Green Wood Mantra's proficiency can increase by 0.18%, and the body refining technique's proficiency can increase by 0.82%," Suyu pondered.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, it would take another year and a half for the Willow Green Wood Mantra to break through to the third layer.</p><p></p><p>As for the body refining technique, it would take a little over two months to break through to the fourth layer.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating by consuming two drops of mid-stage first-tier demonic beast blood essence per day, the improvement speed of the body refining technique was more than twice as fast compared to having no resources.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would be impossible for the body refining technique to advance so quickly.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Suyu tried using low-grade spirit stones to assist in cultivating the Willow Green Wood Mantra, and her cultivation speed did indeed greatly increase, able to gain 0.28% proficiency in a day.</p><p></p><p>If she used spirit stones for a long period of cultivation, she would only need about a year to break through to the third layer of Qi Condensation realm.</p><p></p><p>"If I could have Qi Condensation Pills to assist, the cultivation speed could be even faster. But one bottle has ten Qi Condensation Pills, requiring ten low-grade spirit stones, equivalent to one low-grade spirit stone for one Qi Condensation Pill."</p><p></p><p>"For the early Qi Condensation realm, one Qi Condensation Pill only lasts two to three hours. Compared to using spirit stones, it is more cost-effective to cultivate with spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Suyu shook her head. Right now, not only could she not afford pills, but she could only use one spirit stone every so often to assist in her cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Any more than that and she wouldn't be able to bear it.</p><p></p><p>After calculating her remaining cultivation resources, Suyu spent her days diligently cultivating in addition to completing tasks in the medicine fields.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later one night, Suyu went out again and set five bait traps with demonic luring powder. This time she hunted three demonic rock rats, but they were all just early-stage first-tier demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>Apart from keeping some demonic beast flesh and blood to satisfy her cravings daily, and reserving a small amount of early-stage first-tier demonic beast blood essence, Suyu sold all the remaining materials to the clan, earning another nine low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Time passed slowly.</p><p></p><p>Suyu had been at the medicine garden for two months.</p><p></p><p>During these two months, the demonic rock rat infestation in the medicine garden had become increasingly severe, threatening the safety of the Suyu Clan's medicine garden, with many spirit herbs being gnawed and destroyed by the rock rats.</p><p></p><p>More than a dozen ordinary clansmen had even lost their lives to the claws and fangs of the rock rats.</p><p></p><p>This enraged the Suyu Clan's leadership.</p><p></p><p>They were determined to eliminate the demonic rock rat colony.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the Clan Master Suyu Peng visited the medicine garden and announced a bounty mission. Anyone who hunted an early-stage first-tier demonic rock rat would receive five low-grade spirit stones in addition to the material value.</p><p></p><p>For hunting a mid-stage first-tier demonic rock rat, there would be an additional reward of twenty low-grade spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>For hunting a late-stage first-tier demonic rock rat, there would be an additional reward of one hundred low-grade spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>This was because the demonic rock rat infestation in the medicine garden had reached the point of causing a catastrophic disaster if left unchecked.</p><p></p><p>If the demonic rock rat colony was allowed to grow stronger, even without the influence of a first-tier spirit vein, the Suyu Clan's spirit herb business would be ruined.</p><p></p><p>Whether for the sake of the medicine garden or the first-tier spirit vein, the demonic rock rats had to be...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The group of rat demons must be eliminated and cleared out. </p><p></p><p>Suyu was not clear about how the higher ranks of the family viewed the possible emergence of a first-grade spirit vein in the medicine garden, or whether any preparations had been made behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>However, after the family master Su Peng announced the bounty mission, Suyu was very pleased.</p><p></p><p>In the past month or so, he had only taken action twice, but had hunted five early first-grade earth rat demon beasts.  </p><p></p><p>According to the current bounty offered by the family, even without buying materials, he could earn a total of twenty-five low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Enough money for half a low-grade magic artifact!</p><p></p><p>"Next, I can do more hunting." Suyu made up his mind, it didn't matter if the family noticed his ability to hunt earth rats.</p><p></p><p>This family bounty was enough for him to take the risk and try.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the belongings he had saved up, which included ten low-grade spirit stones.  </p><p></p><p>He took them all out and purchased a full fifty portions of beast-luring powder materials.</p><p></p><p>When night fell, just as Suyu was about to refine a few portions of beast-luring powder to go hunting, a few of his senior martial brothers called him over, planning to ambush and hunt the earth rats together in the medicine fields.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, come with us. After dinner, many people have gone to the medicine fields. Some even plan to stay overnight in the fields," said the eldest senior brother Su Minghuai invitingly, while the other two senior brothers also seemed very eager.</p><p></p><p>The family's bounty had made all the cultivators covet the medicine fields, not just Suyu alone.</p><p></p><p>Hearing what his senior brothers said, Suyu was stunned for a moment, almost miscalculating.  </p><p></p><p>If so many people went to ambush the earth rats, then his chances of successfully luring and hunting them with beast-luring powder would be low.</p><p></p><p>There was even a high possibility of exposing the existence of the beast-luring powder.</p><p></p><p>So for now, he could not hunt in the medicine fields.</p><p></p><p>"No need, I'll just cultivate steadily here. My abilities are not strong," Suyu thought it over and decided to avoid this craze. He would wait until later, as the group of earth rat demons was not easy to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Thus, he politely declined his three senior brothers' invitation and returned to continue cultivating.</p><p></p><p>In the time that followed, the medicine fields were very lively every night, with countless cultivators lying in ambush waiting for the earth rats to appear. Once they showed up, they might be surrounded and attacked by a few or even over ten cultivators.</p><p></p><p>This continued for over a month until nearly a hundred earth rat demons had been hunted down and they rarely appeared anymore. Only then did the cultivators in the medicine garden calm down somewhat.</p><p></p><p>That night, in his room:</p><p></p><p>"Huff! Huff! Huff!"</p><p></p><p>Suyu's entire body emanated an extremely scorching aura. With every exhalation, it was as if blazing flames were being breathed out, glowing red-hot.</p><p></p><p>The blood energy within him churned like a great river, thundering and deafening.  </p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, Suyu's internal blood energy aura reached its limit.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the room was filled with a brilliant blood-red radiance. Suyu's entire body was enveloped in a blood energy aura, like a blood sea that formed the corporeal manifestation of a huge alligator coiled above his head, jaws agape and claws waving menacingly. Piece by piece, blood-colored scales materialized, ferocious and terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Throwing its head back, it let out a earth-shaking roar that reverberated through Suyu's sea of consciousness. On the spirit platform, a hazy figure sat cross-legged, calmly observing this arrogant and domineering behemoth.</p><p></p><p>Strand after strand of blood-colored markings like scales emerged on the surface of Suyu's body. In an instant, his body expanded noticeably, resembling a humanoid alligator with an aura of wild ferocity.</p><p></p><p>This time, it took Suyu nearly half a shichen for his body to completely shed its old state. Only after the blood-colored markings on the surface and the raging blood energy aura gradually receded did his body return to its original appearance.</p><p></p><p>When Suyu opened his eyes and focused his gaze on the proficiency panel, the words on it had changed:</p><p></p><p>[Technique: Alligator Demon's 108 Body Refinement Forms (4th Layer, Proficiency 0.01%).]</p><p></p><p>At the 4th layer of body refinement, his physical body and strength were now no weaker than a mid first-grade demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

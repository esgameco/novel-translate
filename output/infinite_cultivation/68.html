        <h1>Chapter 68</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Many years ago, when Chen Sisi and Su Qingyi became Dao companions, he had returned to the family with the Great Elder Su Yun and Su Zhi to participate in the wedding ceremony. </p><p></p><p>At that time, on their way, they encountered a demonic cultivator ghost leader named Jin Diao, from whom they obtained some opportunities.</p><p></p><p>The second-grade top-tier puppet master inheritance 'Jinyu Tian Zhizhi Method' that Su Yu is currently cultivating is one of them. </p><p></p><p>This puppet master inheritance was originally from the Jinyu Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the ghost leader Jin Diao also had a damaged second-grade lower-tier demonic flag, a disciple token from the inner door of the Nine Souls Demon Palace demonic force, a map of the Eight Demon Ridge, and so on.</p><p></p><p>All those things pointed to the Eight Demon Ridge.</p><p></p><p>However, later Su Yu exchanged all those things with Luo Qianyu, a direct disciple of the Cloud Sword Sect's Great Elder, for a top-grade middle-tier elixir furnace magic treasure, and did not choose to explore what was behind it, pulling himself out.</p><p></p><p>But now, upon hearing the news that a site of the Jinyu Immortal Sect has appeared in the Eight Demon Ridge area, Su Yu suddenly realized and everything made sense.</p><p></p><p>An inner door disciple of the Nine Souls Demon Palace demonic force knew about the Jinyu Immortal Sect site, so he went to the Eight Demon Ridge to search for it. As a result, for some unknown reason, his identity token and some treasures ended up in the hands of the ghost leader Jin Diao, becoming Jin Diao's opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the ghost leader Jin Diao was killed by them.</p><p></p><p>And later, those demonic cultivators and rogue cultivators gathered at the Eight Demon Ridge, possibly because the news of the Jinyu Immortal Sect site had spread out.</p><p></p><p>However, it is unknown why these demonic cultivators and rogue cultivators would seek such a site.</p><p></p><p>After all, now that the site has appeared, orthodox forces like the Cloud Sword Sect, Baimoon Immortal City, Kaiyangong, the Qin Family of Sword City, and even the Great Moon Palace, are all likely to go and seek opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Are they gathering there intending to confront the orthodox forces head-on?</p><p></p><p>A group of demonic cultivators and rogue cultivators, where would they get the courage?</p><p></p><p>This is the territory of the Great Moon Palace, and demonic cultivators here are like street rats, not to be seen.</p><p></p><p>Dare to confront them head-on? That's not just being stubborn, it's like taking a lantern to the toilet, seeking death.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu discussed with Yu Shuan what he knew about the situation. After thinking it over, Yu Shuan said, "Perhaps there is something within the Jinyu Immortal Sect that they want. After all, to attract an inner door disciple of a major demonic force from outside the Great Moon Territory to come search, this Jinyu Immortal Sect site must not be simple."</p><p></p><p>After chatting, Yu Shuan seemed to have relaxed a bit, her expression no longer so grave, and she spoke more.</p><p></p><p>"The things on the list are not urgently needed, so we can take it one month at a time. This immortal sect site is not something we can just enter. It may take five to eight years before the commotion at the Eight Demon Ridge settles down."</p><p></p><p>"I have secured an opportunity to stay in the family clan. Within twenty years, can I become a top-tier second-grade beast tamer?"</p><p></p><p>"Su Yu, if, if you..."</p><p></p><p>At an inopportune moment, Kang Yunian appeared and respectfully presented a task list. "Lord, Miss, someone from the Main Palace has delivered a task list."</p><p></p><p>Yu Shuan's pretty face turned red, and the courage she had just mustered dissipated. She immediately turned her head and glared at him, giving him a death stare.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Kang Yunian's hair stood on end, trembling like an old donkey stared at by a mother tiger. His face turned pale, his scalp tingling, looking utterly bewildered with only one symbol on his forehead: "?"</p><p></p><p>What, what's going on here!?</p><p></p><p>I didn't do anything!!!</p><p></p><p>"Ahem."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu took the list and looked it over, his brows raised. Good heavens, they were all second-grade lower-tier elixir materials, though not expensive, but in large quantities. </p><p></p><p>The Main Palace provided ninety sets of elixir material, only requiring ninety ordinary quality elixir pills to be successfully concocted.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This was one of the tasks, which could earn ninety contribution points. </p><p></p><p>From what he understood, these contribution points from the Zhen Dian could be exchanged for ten low-grade spirit stones each.</p><p></p><p>The conditions were already very good, mainly because these second-grade low-rank pill refining techniques were very simple.</p><p></p><p>The list that the Zhen Dian gave him consisted of three tasks, requiring a total of 270 low-rank spirit pills of three common second-grade varieties, including the Hunyuan Pill for recovering spiritual power, the Yulian Pill for healing injuries, and the Kaiyuan Pill for cultivation.  </p><p></p><p>If a second-grade low-rank pill refiner could complete the tasks on the list, they could earn contribution points worth 2,700 low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>It might take three months to get it all done.</p><p></p><p>This was the income for an ordinary second-grade low-rank pill refiner.</p><p></p><p>If it was Su Yu refining the pills, with 270 pills and 270 portions of materials, he might only need 60 or 70 portions of materials to refine them all, with the remaining materials being pure profit.</p><p></p><p>'I feel like the appearance of the Golden Jade Immortal Ruins may or may not be an opportunity for others, but for me it should be an opportunity?' Su Yu pondered silently. This time he had to make a big profit, so he prepared to take on the Zhen Dian's task list.</p><p></p><p>The Zhen Dian stipulated a period of three months, with one delivery per month, one-third at a time.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Yu Ke'er left a deposit of 9,000 low-grade spirit stones and departed.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu then had the Zhen Dian's people deliver the pill refining materials, and also had Xu Desheng and Kang Yunian prepare the materials needed for the Yu Family's pill orders, as the Yu Family's pills required the Dan Ge to provide its own materials.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Zhen Dian's tasks, the quantity of pills needed by the Yu Family was much larger.</p><p></p><p>However, the Yu Family's order was not for one-time delivery, but spread over a year.  </p><p></p><p>The total price was estimated to be 21,000 low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Nearly half were second-grade low-rank pills, and half were first-grade high-rank pills.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu also looked at the talisman list, though he was tempted, he did not ask for it.</p><p></p><p>Yu Ke'er did not know about the second-grade low-rank talisman master matter, and Su Yu did not intend to reveal it.</p><p></p><p>With the Zhen Dian's task and the Yu Family's order, Su Yu felt that this time he could earn at least 15,000 low-grade spirit stones in profit, over sixty percent.</p><p></p><p>In the time that followed, Su Yu did not bother with the Golden Jade Immortal Ruins, nor did he think about going to contend for opportunities there, instead staying in Bai Yue Immortal City to focus on pill refining.</p><p></p><p>Yu Ke'er would sometimes come to the Pill Pavilion and stay there, even if Su Yu was secluded in the refining room, she would remain in the Pill Pavilion, overseeing everything inside and out.</p><p></p><p>And in between refining pills, Su Yu did not stop his daily cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing every day was to first practice the Cangmu Suixun Gong, the Alligator One Hundred and Eight Body Refining Techniques, the Xuanming Hoututra, and the Golden Cicada Method, gradually accumulating proficiency bit by bit, as this was the foundation of his immortal path.</p><p></p><p>Earning resources through pill refining was secondary, a mere embellishment on the path of immortal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu originally thought the peaceful days would continue, and before long his cultivation would reach the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>But four months later, Yu Qingqing, a inner disciple of the Cloud Sword Sect, found Su Yu at the Pill Pavilion, bringing a qiankun pouch and some bad news.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Chen was severely injured at the Eight Demon Ridge, and although Senior Sister Luo eventually rescued her back to the sect, a month ago Senior Sister Chen still did not survive. Before her demise, Senior Sister Chen instructed that this qiankun pouch be given to Dao Friend Su."</p><p></p><p>"And she also asked that in consideration of her relationship with him, Dao Friend Su take care of the Chen Family's matters in the future."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ps: Today's chapter is updated a bit earlier.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

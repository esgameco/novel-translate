            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Terraced spirit fields connected to each other among the mountains. Some of these spirit fields grew spirit rice, while others grew spirit herbs or other spirit plants. </p><p></p><p>Suyu looked around curiously as they walked. He could see that the spirit rice or herbs grown in the spirit fields here were better than those in the Su Family's herb garden.</p><p></p><p>Noticing Suyu's curious looks, Sujingbang said, "The spirit fields here can be rented."</p><p></p><p>"Most cultivators staying in this town rely on these spirit fields for a living."  </p><p></p><p>"However, such a life is ultimately living under someone else's roof. The fees for renting the spirit fields basically amount to farming for the Cloud Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>He paused for a moment, then sighed, "Our Su Family ancestors first built their foundation in this very town." </p><p></p><p>"Later they went to establish themselves in Jiangcheng and set up the herb garden, slowly accumulating to the family business we have today."</p><p></p><p>The Su Family members felt moved upon hearing this. The hardships of going from a wandering cultivator to an established cultivation family were hard for ordinary people to imagine. Even though the Su Family was still weak, this was the result of over ten generations' efforts.</p><p></p><p>Sujingbang looked at Suyu and said, "If you don't want to stay in the herb garden in the future, it's not bad to strive to come here."</p><p></p><p>"With the Pill Pavilion as our foundation, cultivating here would be much better than being an ordinary wandering cultivator."</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, the group headed towards the town center. Along the way, they could see other cultivators coming and going, as well as some tending to spirit plants in the fields.</p><p></p><p>The center of Cloud Mountain Town was built in a valley surrounded by misty mountains. White-robed cultivators flew past, presenting a scenery of immortals.</p><p></p><p>The Su Family's Pill Pavilion was located on the third main street east of the town center, an area with heavy foot traffic. </p><p></p><p>The one managing the Pill Pavilion's operations was Su Yun, the second elder of the Su Family, a reclusive and taciturn first-grade pill refiner. </p><p></p><p>Upon entering and seeing Su Yun, Suyu and the others respectfully greeted him, but he didn't even look at them, only towards Sujingbang.</p><p></p><p>Sujingbang took out two interspatial rings and handed them to Su Yun, saying, "Second Elder, these are this month's spirit herb products."</p><p></p><p>After inspecting them with his spiritual sense, Su Yun frowned in displeasure, "The quality is still so poor."</p><p></p><p>Sujingbang smiled, "It's actually better than before."</p><p></p><p>Originally Suyu had wanted to get acquainted in hopes of one day becoming Su Yun's pill refining apprentice. But after taking the spirit herbs, Su Yun waved them off and returned to the back rooms of the Pill Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>This was normal for Sujingbang and the others. He looked at Suyu and said, "Alright, you can do as you please next."</p><p></p><p>"We'll stay at the Pill Pavilion tonight and head back tomorrow afternoon."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Suyu blinking at him expectantly, Sujingbang rubbed his bald head and said with slight disdain, "Fine, I was planning to take a nap - I'll show you around the town."</p><p></p><p>Suyu immediately smiled, "Great, I'll treat you to some good wine tonight."</p><p></p><p>The others dispersed without joining them.</p><p></p><p>The two left the Pill Pavilion, with Sujingbang leading Suyu to explore the town. Most of the town consisted of shops, with areas also set aside for wandering cultivators to set up stalls.</p><p></p><p>Sujingbang asked, "Did you want to buy anything?"</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Suyu said, "Cultivation resources like demonic beast essence blood. Also, let's see if there are any strange but cheap items."</p><p></p><p>Sujingbang pondered briefly, "Demonic beast essence blood is easy. As for strange but cheap items...you have an odd interest, kid."</p><p></p><p>"Follow me, there's a place that should suit you."</p><p></p><p>Suyu followed Sujingbang inwards until they arrived before a three-story wooden building in the northern part of town. Suyu looked at the sign on the building and his heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Shock.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Shu Ge?" Su Yu was dazed for a moment. </p><p></p><p>This name—</p><p></p><p>He was quite familiar with it. Just like Bai Yue Xian Cheng, there was one in the cultivation game he played in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>It specialized in selling all kinds of strange things, but these things all had one thing in common.</p><p></p><p>That was the ancient jade boxes!</p><p></p><p>Tian Shu Ge would purchase or collect ancient jade boxes from various places, either open them themselves or sell them. They would also buy the things that customers obtained from opening the ancient jade boxes to resell.</p><p></p><p>So, this Tian Shu Ge force was quite eccentric, or rather, mysterious. </p><p></p><p>Previously in the game, the items sold by Tian Shu Ge had unknown attributes. Whether they were treasures or trash was completely up to luck.</p><p></p><p>This place was simply a money-devouring beast.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu didn't expect to see the existence of Tian Shu Ge in the Cloud Mountain Town market.</p><p></p><p>"What are you spacing out for? Let's go in and take a look." Su Jing Bang called out to Su Yu, and the two entered Tian Shu Ge.</p><p></p><p>Inside Tian Shu Ge, there were many divided areas. The most eye-catching one was the sale of ancient jade boxes.</p><p></p><p>These things were clearly quite deceptive.</p><p></p><p>But after entering Tian Shu Ge, Su Yu saw that this was the area with the most people.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu sneered inwardly, silently cursing them as a bunch of gamblers.</p><p></p><p>His goal was clear. After realizing this was Tian Shu Ge, he glanced around after entering and headed towards an area labeled "Ancient Classics."</p><p></p><p>Su Jing Bang looked at him and said, "I'll take a look around. Call me when you're ready to leave."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu waved his hand dismissively and quickly walked up to a bookshelf, browsing through the books one by one. Most of the books here only had the beginning portions and were incomplete. If you wanted the complete version, you had to buy it.</p><p></p><p>What he wanted was something similar to the "108 Alligator Demon Body Refining Techniques" – a cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>Other people would find it very difficult to cultivate, or even impossible to succeed.</p><p></p><p>But its power was quite formidable.</p><p></p><p>For other people, such cultivation methods were useless, but for him, they were treasures.</p><p></p><p>The Wushan Chronicles. </p><p>The Sixty-Eight Oddities of Guanhai.</p><p>The Demon King of Cangzhou.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu flipped through the books one by one. Most were just stories, biographies and the like. There were some cultivation methods and spells too, but they were severely incomplete and useless.</p><p></p><p>After more than an hour, on the third bookshelf amidst a pile of ancient books, Su Yu opened a tome and his brows moved slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Cangmu Suixuan Gong.</p><p></p><p>This name was a bit strange. As Su Yu read on, he realized something.</p><p></p><p>This was a wood-attribute cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>Legend had it that in ancient times, there was a towering ancient tree in the immortal realm called Cangmu that could reach the heavenly realm above and explore reincarnation below.</p><p></p><p>One year, one cycle. One cycle, one reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>This was an extraordinary skill based on the great way of Cangmu. If one could cultivate it to completion, they would gain the wonder of longevity.</p><p></p><p>However—</p><p></p><p>This actually required the origin aura of Cangmu to lay the foundation!</p><p></p><p>And on this ancient book were many records of people's research, including a legendary figure from the former Cloud Sword Sect and even Bai Yue Zhen Ren of Bai Yue Xian Cheng had studied it.</p><p></p><p>But without exception, none of them could see through it.</p><p></p><p>Such things were not uncommon, like the "108 Alligator Demon Body Refining Techniques." This body refining technique was actually very powerful.</p><p></p><p>But after being passed down for so many years, not a single person could cultivate it successfully.</p><p></p><p>For other cultivators, wasn't that just useless or even trash?</p><p></p><p>Su Yu didn't know if he could cultivate it, but looking at this, he was indeed moved. "Good stuff."</p><p></p><p>However, he wasn't in a hurry and continued looking.</p><p></p><p>Things similar to the Cangmu Suixuan Gong wouldn't be rare, especially in a place like Tian Shu Ge.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 67</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Bai Yue Xian City had three palaces, namely the Ling Palace, the Zhan Palace, and the Zhen Palace. </p><p></p><p>The Ling Palace was managed by Elder Tian Pu, the senior disciple of the Bai Yue Zhen Ren, and was responsible for the spiritual fields, spiritual objects, housing transactions in the outer and inner domains, etc. It was the money bag of Bai Yue Xian City.</p><p></p><p>The Zhan Palace was managed by Feng Ling Xian Zi, the second disciple of Bai Yue Zhen Ren, and was in charge of all the guard squads in Bai Yue Xian City. It was the spear and shield of Bai Yue Xian City.</p><p></p><p>The Zhen Palace was managed by Xu Wansheng, the third disciple of Bai Yue Zhen Ren. It accepted cultivators of the hundred arts and was a new force backed by Bai Yue Xian City.</p><p></p><p>Although it was a new force, it was not to be underestimated within Bai Yue Xian City.</p><p></p><p>According to what Su Yu had heard, the Zhen Palace had recruited over a hundred people in recent years, with more than ten above the second grade. Most of the scattered cultivators of the hundred arts in Bai Yue Xian City had established some connections with the Zhen Palace.</p><p></p><p>The development momentum of the Zhen Palace was fierce.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, the resources of the hundred arts of cultivation managed by the Zhen Palace in Bai Yue Xian City were indeed unmatched by anyone else.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Yu now showed a difficult expression and said, "I'm sorry, fellow cultivator. I am a pill refiner from the Yu Family. This Pill Pavilion was also established by Miss Yu Ke'er. Joining the Zhen Palace is probably going to disappoint you."</p><p></p><p>Hu Xiu said, "The Third Young Master recently made a decision that, apart from directly joining the Zhen Palace as a disciple, cultivators of the hundred arts can also choose to become outer servants of the Zhen Palace. They can take on missions from the Zhen Palace in exchange for contribution points, which can be redeemed for various resources from the Zhen Palace, including Foundation Establishment Pills and even the subsequent inheritance for pill refiners, such as the inheritance of a second-grade superior pill refiner."</p><p></p><p>Hu Xiu's gaze fell on Su Yu, and there was a slight smile on his face as he said, "The Zhen Palace does not impose many restrictions on its servants. They only need to complete two fixed missions per year, and they can choose the missions themselves."</p><p></p><p>"Apart from that, the Zhen Palace will not force its servants to do anything else, nor will it care about the servants' identities."</p><p></p><p>"So, Fellow Cultivator Su can join the Zhen Palace and choose to become a servant."</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Hu Xiu left with his people, satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu, on the other hand, was shocked in his heart. From Hu Xiu's description, the third disciple of Bai Yue Zhen Ren had no small ambition.</p><p></p><p>If it were truly as Hu Xiu said, then the scattered cultivators of the hundred arts gathered in Bai Yue Xian City might all choose to join the Zhen Palace as servants, taking on missions to earn contribution points and redeeming the resources they needed with those points.</p><p></p><p>With this development model, the Zhen Palace's momentum would be unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>This model of force development was too attractive, especially for scattered cultivators.</p><p></p><p>After careful consideration, Su Yu also decided to join the Zhen Palace as a servant. After all, according to what Hu Xiu said, the Zhen Palace basically had no restrictions on its servants, only requiring them to complete two random missions of their respective grades per year.</p><p></p><p>For example, as a second-grade inferior pill refiner, he could simply take on two missions to refine second-grade inferior pills.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, there were no other restrictions.</p><p></p><p>This would do him no harm.</p><p></p><p>And the Zhen Palace, backed by Bai Yue Xian City, was undoubtedly the force with the richest resources for the hundred arts of cultivation in Bai Yue Xian City, unmatched by any other.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he could even borrow the Zhen Palace's resources to collect some materials he needed.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he would not be foolish enough to redeem everything, exposing himself completely to the Zhen Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Let's observe first." Su Yu frowned slightly. If the Zhen Palace truly controlled all or most of the cultivators of the hundred arts in Bai Yue Xian City, then this force would already be formidable.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, he could not say whether it would be good or bad for him. He could only act according to the circumstances.</p><p></p><p>If it really became unfavorable, he could simply leave.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation world was vast, and Bai Yue Xian City was only the nearest major market city to him, not the only one.</p><p></p><p>Of course, for now, this was purely him considering the worst-case scenario, which might not necessarily happen.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances. </p><p></p><p>After all, as long as he didn't show up, he would just be invisible.</p><p></p><p>A powerful force like the True Palace would not set their sights on him.</p><p></p><p>He returned to the backyard.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu checked his small treasury. Apart from the expenses during this period, he now had more than three thousand low-grade spirit stones left. The Pill Pavilion had barely earned one thousand low-grade spirit stones in three months.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I need to store more second-grade low-level talisman papers," Su Yu thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>During this time, he had focused his efforts on cultivation, pill refining, and puppet beasts, without drawing many talismans. </p><p></p><p>The stock of second-grade low-level talisman papers was about to drop below ten pieces.</p><p></p><p>This was too terrible.</p><p></p><p>He must replenish them as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Su Yu released his body puppet, letting it take on the appearance and stature of an old man wearing a bamboo hat, and quietly left the Pill Pavilion to purchase the materials needed for second-grade low-level talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>By evening when Su Yu returned to the alley courtyard, the body puppet had been waiting in the underground chamber.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu calmed his mind and murmured softly, "Next, draw talismans."</p><p></p><p>Second-grade low-level invisibility talisman, second-grade low-level spirit travel talisman, second-grade low-level breath-suppressing talisman, second-grade low-level Heavenly Stem Armor talisman...</p><p></p><p>Su Yu drew a batch of these common yet potent talismans.</p><p></p><p>As for special talismans like the Thunder and Fire Talisman, Fire Dragon Talisman, and Fire Thunder Sword Talisman, due to material constraints, they accounted for less than forty percent. The materials for these talismans were quite expensive, and there were not many talisman papers, especially premium ones.</p><p></p><p>Over the next half year.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he had free time, Su Yu would spend his evenings in the underground chamber of the alley courtyard drawing talismans.</p><p></p><p>Although second-grade low-level talismans were difficult to draw, as Su Yu's proficiency improved, he could basically produce two second-grade low-level talismans per evening by the end.</p><p></p><p>This was mainly because his spiritual power at the ninth level of the Qi Refining Realm could not sustain him for longer.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, his output could have been higher.</p><p></p><p>The success rate was not a hundred percent, but it was definitely above ninety percent.</p><p></p><p>One day.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu was cultivating in the backyard of the Pill Pavilion when Yu Zhuan'er reappeared after disappearing for half a year. Although it had only been half a year, Yu Zhuan'er's cultivation had already broken through the bottleneck of the Foundation Establishment Realm and successfully reached the first level of the Foundation Establishment Realm.</p><p></p><p>Yu Zhuan'er had a decent natural talent. After accumulating years in the Qi Refining Realm, she finally broke through to the first level of the Foundation Establishment Realm at the age of forty.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Su Zhi and Luo Qianyu, her speed was much slower.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing Su Yu, Yu Zhuan'er did not engage in idle chat but spoke with a slightly grave expression, "A celestial relic has appeared in the Eight Demon Ridge. The demonic cultivators and renegade cultivators who have been occupying the Eight Demon Ridge were after this relic."</p><p></p><p>"Now, this place has attracted the attention of many forces and cultivators. It is said that Elder Tian Pu and Fairy Feng Ling from the Moon-Worshipping Immortal City have led people to the Eight Demon Ridge."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's expression showed surprise. A place that could be called a celestial relic was no ordinary secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Legendary artifacts like the Ancient Jade Box and Ancient Inheritances were said to come from such places.</p><p></p><p>At first, Su Yu thought Yu Zhuan'er wanted him to join in exploring that relic, but that was not the case.</p><p></p><p>Yu Zhuan'er looked at Su Yu with a gentle gaze and said, "My Yu Family is involved in this matter, and we need a batch of pills and talismans. The family has asked me to collect as many as possible in the Moon-Worshipping Immortal City. Take a look at this list and see how many you can refine."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Yu Zhuan'er handed over a list. Upon seeing it, Su Yu's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>The only two words in his mind were "get rich."</p><p></p><p>However, after learning the name of that celestial relic from Yu Zhuan'er, he was immediately taken aback.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Jade Celestial Sect Ruins?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

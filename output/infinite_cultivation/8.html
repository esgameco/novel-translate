        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>His mind returned from the proficiency panel. Seeing the empty jade bottle, Su Yu couldn't help but shake his head: "Without demonic beast essence blood, this straight-line decline in cultivation speed is really uncomfortable."</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he finally succeeded in breaking through.</p><p></p><p>In order to break through the fourth level of the Body Refining Technique, Su Yu had consumed all his resources over the past two months. The demonic beast essence blood he had hunted before ran out some time ago. </p><p></p><p>After receiving his monthly allowance, he bought some first-level mid-grade demonic beast essence blood.</p><p></p><p>He spent all his spirit stones, barely allowing himself to break through the fourth level of the 'Alligator Demon's 108 Body Refining Techniques'.</p><p></p><p>Howeverâ€”</p><p></p><p>Su Yu sensed the changes in his body and the surging, violent force hidden deep within.</p><p></p><p>Those resources spent were worth it.</p><p></p><p>After the aura of blood energy in his body was completely contained, Su Yu went outside and looked at the deep black night and the medicinal fields with only insect chirps remaining.</p><p></p><p>"I can try hunting rock rats now," Su Yu thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>It really wasn't easy waiting for those people to settle down.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't earn some money, he wouldn't be able to afford the expenses for his next cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Back inside, Su Yu began grinding beast luring powder. The materials he had purchased before were well preserved and usable now.</p><p></p><p>He ground five portions of beast luring powder, went out stealthily to a remote medicinal field, mixed it with spirit rice, and set five traps before leaving.</p><p></p><p>After more than two hours, Su Yu returned to check.</p><p></p><p>He was overjoyed to see that the five traps had knocked out three rock rats, one of which was a mid-grade first-level great demonic rat.</p><p></p><p>"Including the bounty materials, at least sixty low-grade spirit stones will be obtained," Su Yu said happily as he approached and firmly twisted the head of the great demonic rat.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>The head rotated 360 degrees, causing the demonic rat's eyeballs to bulge out, nearly twisting its head off.</p><p></p><p>If there was any difference between twisting the brain of a mid-grade first-level demonic beast after breaking through the fourth level of the Body Refining Technique compared to the third level, Su Yu felt it was much easier now.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had to explode his physical strength to do it, but now he could easily twist off the head of a mid-grade first-level demonic beast with a casual twist of his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go back." After destroying the two remaining spirit rice traps mixed with beast luring powder, Su Yu led the three rock rats back stealthily.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, before others had woken up, Su Yu had already arrived at the medicinal hall of the manor carrying a sack.</p><p></p><p>Inside, an old man with white hair was frowning at the accounts. Seeing Su Yu enter, his brow relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?" the old man asked kindly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the elder, Su Yu respectfully went forward and bowed, saying: "Third Elder, I've come to redeem the bounty."</p><p></p><p>He handed over the sack.</p><p></p><p>The old man was Su Chang, the third elder of the Su family, in charge of guarding the medicinal garden and overseeing the planting and operation of the spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>This medicinal hall was the center of the medicinal garden.</p><p></p><p>Su Chang was slightly surprised to see one mid-grade first-level and two early first-level rock rats in the sack. He looked at Su Yu and asked, "Did you hunt these?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu replied, "I hunted them together with a few martial brothers. I'm just here to claim the reward."</p><p></p><p>Su Chang praised him: "Not bad, being able to hunt a mid-grade first-level rock rat has eliminated a major threat to the medicinal garden."</p><p></p><p>The rock rat demonic beast group was quite numerous, but most were only early first-level demonic beasts. Mid-grade first-level rock rats were not common.</p><p></p><p>He had not seen any late first-level rock rats.</p><p></p><p>After praising him, Su Chang took out the low-grade spirit stones for the bounty and the material value of the three demonic beasts. Since the mid-grade first-level rock rat did not have any essence blood material, the total, including the bounty reward, was only forty-two low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>The bounty reward alone was thirty low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Early first-level demonic beast materials were not worth much.</p><p></p><p>After receiving the spirit stones, Su Yu respectfully took his leave and left the medicinal hall.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>One week later.</p><p></p><p>At night, Su Yu once again prepared five portions of beast luring powder, and this time he hunted two early stage first-level earth rock rats. </p><p></p><p>The next day, he found a time when the Third Elder was not in the pharmacy, went to redeem the bounty, and bought the materials.</p><p></p><p>This time, he received fourteen low-grade spirit stones.  </p><p></p><p>Half a month later, the third hunt.</p><p></p><p>This time, Su Yu hunted as many as four early stage first-level earth rock rats.</p><p></p><p>The next day, he redeemed twenty-eight low-grade spirit stones from exchanging them.</p><p></p><p>And with the spirit stones he had accumulated, he exchanged for a talisman suitable for himself at the pharmacy: the Crimson Luo Blade.</p><p></p><p>A low-grade talisman forged from the special crimson luo ore, about two feet and two inches long, it looked like a slightly curved short knife with a single-edged blade.</p><p></p><p>Its only two specialties were sharpness and armor penetration.</p><p></p><p>Priced at sixty low-grade spirit stones, it was not expensive.</p><p></p><p>After acquiring the talisman, Su Yu still had twenty-four low-grade spirit stones left.</p><p></p><p>In the time to come, Su Yu did not plan to hunt earth rock rats so frequently, at most once every half a month or month.</p><p></p><p>At the pharmacy, the Third Elder Su Chang looked at the bounty records with slight surprise. Within half a month, that junior named Su Yu had actually hunted as many as nine earth rock rats.</p><p></p><p>This number was quite unusual.</p><p></p><p>Looking further, not long ago Su Yu had spent sixty low-grade spirit stones to exchange for a low-grade Crimson Luo Blade talisman.</p><p></p><p>"Good kid, he previously said it was earth rock rats hunted together with a few senior martial brothers." Su Chang chuckled dryly, "But then he turned around and bought a low-grade talisman himself?"</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't seen the account book records himself, he wouldn't have even noticed.</p><p></p><p>"Could this kid have some trick for hunting earth rock rats?" Su Chang found it quite interesting and took notice of Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>After all, Su Yu was only seventeen years old, with records showing his cultivation was at the second level of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>But he could hunt first level mid-stage earth rock rats, which was very abnormal.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Chang only paid some attention to Su Yu, and did not go to great lengths to investigate Su Yu's secret, as there was no need.</p><p></p><p>Back in his own room.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu refined the low-grade Crimson Luo Blade talisman, storing it within his dantian to nurture it with his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>This talisman was not for long-range use, but rather to take advantage of his own Body Refining technique's strengths in close combat.</p><p></p><p>After all, compared to his mere second level of Qi Refining spiritual power, his fourth level Body Refining technique was his strongest ability at present.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I'll focus on cultivating the Willow Green Wood Mantra." Su Yu looked at the Crimson Luo Blade talisman in his dantian and secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>With the fourth level of Body Refining technique and a low-grade talisman by his side, he at least had some assurance of safety.</p><p></p><p>He was no longer a helpless novice cultivator to be slaughtered at will.</p><p></p><p>Nurturing the talisman, cultivating spiritual power, and using the essence blood of first level mid-stage demonic beasts to cultivate the Body Refining technique.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's life in the medicine garden was very regular, from morning till night, each day seeing his mastery of the techniques steadily increase, giving him a sense of fulfillment.</p><p></p><p>It was only after the Body Refining technique reached the fourth level that the essence blood of first level mid-stage demonic beasts no longer had much effect on it.</p><p></p><p>The rate of increase in mastery of the Body Refining technique became as slow as that of spiritual power from the Willow Green Wood Mantra.</p><p></p><p>This peaceful daily life suddenly changed after half a year.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu had just requested a leave of absence from the Third Pharmacy Elder, planning to return to his family home in Jiangcheng, but before he could leave the medicine garden, some bad news arrived.</p><p></p><p>Su Qingyi and a few cultivators from the medicine garden clan had gone out on leave but were ambushed by the Lin family, with only Su Qingyi managing to escape back to Jiangcheng, but severely injured.</p><p></p><p>The other few were killed in the ambush by the Lin family.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the relationship between the two major cultivator families in Jiangcheng became extremely tense, with swords drawn and bows bent.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 31</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"No need."</p><p></p><p>After glancing at the area with the ancient jade box, Su Yu shook his head. He did not detect anything unusual, and under normal circumstances, he would not touch it. </p><p></p><p>The last time was an accident caused by the Primordial Spiritual Cultivation Technique and Spirit Nurturing Art, not because he could see through the ancient jade box.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Su Yu turned and walked towards the book area: "Let me take a look at these."</p><p></p><p>After searching in this area and relying on his memory from browsing before, it took him a moment to find the location. Su Yu picked up a partially preserved ancient talisman inheritance.</p><p></p><p>It recorded the incomplete inheritance of three special talisman diagrams, missing some parts.</p><p></p><p>This missing part rendered this inheritance useless paper.</p><p></p><p>However, the Heavenly Book Pavilion had found relevant information about these three ancient talismans and wrote it down.</p><p></p><p>[Five Elements Lightning Fire Talisman: One of the commonly seen Five Elements Lightning talismans from antiquity, this inherited talisman is of the first upper-grade level, requiring the essence blood of a first upper-grade fire-attribute demonic beast and talisman paper.]</p><p></p><p>[Fire Dragon Talisman: An ordinary ancient talisman of the first upper-grade level, requiring the essence blood of a first upper-grade fire-attribute demonic beast and talisman paper.]</p><p></p><p>[Fire Lightning Sword Talisman: Suspected to be of the second-grade level]</p><p></p><p>After finding this, Su Yu went to the counter to pay the elder.</p><p></p><p>For fifty low-grade spirit stones, Su Yu obtained the complete fragmented inheritance, then left the Heavenly Book Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The elder sitting at the counter, having collected the spirit stones, smiled and watched Su Yu's departing back. After Su Yu had gone far away, the elder's expression became profound and surprised.</p><p></p><p>The elder sniffed, detecting the extremely faint scent of spirit pills in the air, and muttered in a voice only he could hear: "The scent of perfect spirit pills, many kinds."</p><p></p><p>"None of the first upper-grade, but many first middle-grade and first lower-grade perfect spirit pills."</p><p></p><p>"Hiss, how did this kid manage that?"</p><p></p><p>Based on that barely detectable spirit pill scent, he analyzed a lot and was extremely shocked in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He had seen perfect spirit pills with spirit patterns before.</p><p></p><p>But for a young pill refiner of only around twenty years old at the first middle-grade level to be able to refine many kinds of perfect spirit pills, it left him dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Great Moon Territory, even going back a thousand years, no such freak had appeared.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the fragmented talisman inheritance Su Yu had taken, the elder pondered and muttered: "He couldn't be thinking of cultivating the talisman way too, could he?"</p><p></p><p>He didn't think those useless papers had any use, but if Su Yu exhibited the same formidable talent in the talisman way as his pill refining talent...</p><p></p><p>Then—</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Book Pavilion likes freaks, but let's wait and see. This kid's cultivation talent is a bit...no, extremely terrible, like heaven and earth apart." The elder shook his head and sighed lightly.</p><p></p><p>Although the accidental discovery just now let him know of a freak who seemed to have an extremely formidable pill refining talent, it was not enough.</p><p></p><p>The root of a cultivator was their cultivation level. Other skills like pill refining, talismans, formations, etc. were just branches.</p><p></p><p>Without cultivation talent and level, it amounted to nothing.</p><p></p><p>Recalling Su Yu's extremely poor cultivation talent, still only at the fourth layer of Qi Condensation realm at over twenty years old, the elder sighed lightly. The Heavenly Book Pavilion's members were all freaks, mostly spirit roots, so special talents could be relaxed a bit.</p><p></p><p>But a mortal root... The elder shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu returned to the Pill Pavilion and began studying that fragmented ancient talisman inheritance.</p><p></p><p>Over this past year or so, he had advanced to the perfected first middle-grade level in the talisman way. The inheritance he had acquired from the auction previously contained records of over ten talismans, and he had raised his proficiency with all of them to the perfected level.</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining five first upper-grade talismans recorded, he had studied them for some time as well.</p><p></p><p>If he prepared fully and tried multiple times, he should be able to draw first upper-grade talismans.</p><p></p><p>However, he was not very interested in ordinary talismans, which is why he thought of this fragmented talisman inheritance from the Heavenly Book Pavilion. Although it was impossible to draw the talismans by following the incomplete inheritance, he could perhaps gain insights to increase the might of the talismans he had mastered or create new ones.</p><p></p><p>This was possible...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Let's hope for the best.</p><p></p><p>Fifty low-grade spirit stones to buy an incomplete template for reference, it's not a bad deal. </p><p></p><p>"Lightning Law, Fire Lightning Sword, this diagram is quite profound. I wonder how powerful these complete talisman formations would be," Su Yu was increasingly astonished the more he studied them.</p><p></p><p>These three fragmentary ancient talisman formations were far more powerful than the first-grade high-quality talisman inheritance he obtained at the auction. </p><p></p><p>It was probably the difference between a defective product and a premium one.</p><p></p><p>As the stars shifted and the sun and moon cycled, the hubbub outside had nothing to do with Su Yu. Every day, he diligently cultivated the Qingmu Suixun Technique and the One Hundred and Eight Alligator Body Refining Forms.</p><p></p><p>His magic power and body refinement improved by a tiny bit each day.</p><p></p><p>This kind of strength had no end, no bottleneck. The feeling of his cultivation advancing every day gave Su Yu a great sense of comfort and security.</p><p></p><p>In his spare time from increasing his strength, Su Yu also studied pill formulas and talismans.</p><p></p><p>Although his cultivation was not high enough to continue refining stronger pills and talismans, he was not satisfied with the pill formulas and talismans created by others.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was just a minor Qi Refining cultivator, if he didn't even have the courage to try, then he didn't deserve to be among the ranks of travelers.</p><p></p><p>Another half a year passed.</p><p></p><p>In the Pill Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's cultivation had changed. A month ago, the Qingmu Suixun Technique broke through from the fourth to the fifth cycle of rotation, adding another "annual ring" to his body. His cultivation advanced to the fifth level of the Qi Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>He was now twenty-four years old.</p><p></p><p>After his breakthrough, Su Yu began attempting to refine first-grade high-quality pills and draw first-grade high-quality talismans.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Su Yu was trying to create a new first-grade high-quality talisman.</p><p></p><p>Over an hour later,</p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>With a dazzling burst of fiery light from the talisman paper made from the hide of a first-grade high-quality demonic beast of the fire attribute, the sweat-drenched Su Yu revealed a hint of joy on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Did it work?" He put down the talisman brush, looking at the talisman with its aura now subdued with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>He took the talisman into the next room and activated a layer of defensive formation.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu infused a strand of magic power into the talisman to activate and trigger it, then threw it out.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The talisman burned away in midair, and a crimson flame arrow materialized from nowhere. In an instant, the arrow struck the defensive barrier, directly tearing through it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing its power, Su Yu happily exclaimed, "It worked! The Fire Cloud Arrow Talisman, its might is comparable to a full-power strike from the ninth level of the Qi Refining Realm!"</p><p></p><p>This was a new talisman he created using the Cloud-Piercing Arrow Talisman as a template while referencing the Fire Dragon Talisman and the Fire Lightning Sword Talisman.</p><p></p><p>With the raging fire attribute and a hint of the profundity of the ancient talismans, the power of the "Cloud-Piercing Arrow Talisman" increased by at least fifty percent.</p><p></p><p>After the excitement, Su Yu went back to meditate and recover his magic power and mental stamina.</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>News came from the family clan.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu looked at Su Jingbang in front of him, surprised, "What? The Chen Family wants to join forces with our clan, with the condition of getting thirty percent of the profits from the Purple Gold Sand Spirit Vein?"</p><p></p><p>Su Jingbang nodded, "The Fifth Elder has agreed to it, to join forces with the Chen Family to drive away the Bai Family."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu fell silent. In his opinion, the Su Family should be focusing on cultivation right now. With the newly acquired resource, they could at least support one or even two members reaching the Foundation Establishment Realm.</p><p></p><p>They could also cultivate a few dozen more cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Joining forces with the Chen Family at this time, just for the so-called thirty percent profit from the Purple Gold Sand Spirit Vein to deal with the Bai Family of Maple City, was a side pursuit that was unwise.</p><p></p><p>However—</p><p></p><p>This was the clan's decision, and as a junior member, he had no say in it.</p><p></p><p>Su Jingbang added, "The Chen Family has decided to have their disciple from the Cloud Sword Sect, Chen Sisi, marry our Qing Yi. That's the main reason the Fifth Elder agreed to the alliance."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu was slightly taken aback upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Chen Sisi and Su Qing Yi...getting married?</p><p></p><p>"This...I really didn't expect this," Su Yu muttered.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

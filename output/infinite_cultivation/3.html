        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After mastering the entry-level 'Alligator Demon's 108 Body Refining Techniques', Su Yu felt his body had undergone a qualitative transformation. A surging, tremendous force emerged from the depths of his body, and his bones, flesh, and skin all underwent immense changes. </p><p></p><p>A layer of blood-colored veins resembling the scales of an alligator demon appeared on the surface of his skin. The moment the blood energy surged into these blood-colored veins, Su Yu felt an extremely ferocious power, as if he had transformed into a mighty alligator demon.</p><p></p><p>"These body refining techniques are no simple matter!"</p><p></p><p>"This is just the first entry-level layer, yet the transformation of physical strength far surpasses the power of my current qi cultivation realm!"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu couldn't help being shocked. He felt that if he used his current cultivation power against the power of these body refining techniques, perhaps the power of the body refining techniques could shatter his former self with a single punch.</p><p></p><p>It embodied the very essence of violence.</p><p></p><p>A glimpse revealed the whole picture - in the ancient times, physical cultivation was definitely not weaker than spiritual cultivation!</p><p></p><p>At the very least, it would not be inferior to cultivators of the immortal path!</p><p></p><p>The entry-level took ten days to complete. After his body underwent this transformation, Su Yu's appetite greatly increased, and he had to eat meat, preferably that of demonic beasts, with every meal.</p><p></p><p>Correspondingly, as his body refining techniques became more proficient, the increase in proficiency was much faster compared to the slowly growing proficiency of the Wutong Greenwood Mantra.</p><p></p><p>Spending a day eating and drinking to his fill while cultivating the body refining techniques could increase the proficiency by at least 1%.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and a month passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Today was the day to receive the new month's allowance. The young cultivators of the Su Family held an internal trade fair.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Yu, hurry up, the trade fair is about to start," Su Qingyi called out from outside Su Yu's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The trade fair was held in the backyard of the Su Family manor, where more than a dozen stalls were set up.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu and Su Qingyi strolled around, stopping to look at the various stalls.</p><p></p><p>Most of the items traded at these stalls were very ordinary, even including pills and medicinal ingredients used by mortal martial artists.</p><p></p><p>However, as they passed by one stall, Su Yu took an interest in one item.</p><p></p><p>It was a drop of mid-grade first-level demonic beast essence blood, priced at half a low-grade spirit stone.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Su Yu bought it.</p><p></p><p>Su Qingyi, following behind, looked puzzled. "What do you need demonic beast essence blood for? Apart from pill refining and talisman crafting, you can't use it, right?"</p><p></p><p>Half a low-grade spirit stone was a sum that could not be wasted for the two who had just embarked on the path of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu smiled and put away the jade bottle containing the demonic beast essence blood. "I have a use for it."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, a glimmer flashed in Su Qingyi's eyes, and he did not persuade further.</p><p></p><p>A use for it?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he wanted to learn pill refining or talisman crafting?</p><p></p><p>But even if he wanted to learn pill refining or talisman crafting, he should start from the basics and seek out a master in the clan to become an apprentice, right?</p><p></p><p>At the last stall, Su Yu and Su Qingyi saw a row of ancient jade boxes.</p><p></p><p>These were known as Forbidden Jade Boxes in the cultivation world, passed down from ancient times. Most of them were excavated from ancient ruins and secret realms, and due to the seals placed upon them, these jade boxes that had endured countless years would retain a special aura.</p><p></p><p>Once the seal was broken, that aura would dissipate.</p><p></p><p>Hence, the Forbidden Jade Boxes from ancient secret realms could not be counterfeited.</p><p></p><p>The inner spatial dimensions of these jade boxes varied, some large and some small. Perhaps they would contain remnants from ancient times, or perhaps they would be completely empty.</p><p></p><p>Some had uncovered shocking legacies from within these ancient jade boxes.</p><p></p><p>But more often, people ended up losing everything because of these jade boxes.</p><p></p><p>This item relied entirely on luck from ancient times, with odds even slimmer than winning the lottery.</p><p></p><p>The person manning the stall was actually the Fifth Elder, Su Bin. Seeing Su Yu and Su Qingyi, he smiled and said, "Little Yu, Qingyi, do you want to..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Want an ancient jade box? Inside it contains ancient opportunities."</p><p></p><p>"When the Venerable of Moon Worship from Moon Worship Immortal City was young, it was because he obtained an ancient opportunity from an ancient jade box that he was able to rise up and establish Moon Worship Immortal City."</p><p></p><p>"Opportunities won't come again if missed. Just one low-grade spirit stone can get you an ancient opportunity - it's a great deal."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu looked speechlessly at the Fifth Elder who had transformed into a street vendor. The two little fellows could only offer one low-grade spirit stone per month as tribute. </p><p></p><p>Yet he actually tried to coax them into buying an ancient jade box. How shameless.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Su Qing Yi was also reluctant to spend, but after hearing the example of the Venerable of Moon Worship, his gaze instantly focused, staring intently at the various ancient jade boxes on the street stall.</p><p></p><p>These ancient jade boxes looked different from each other, bearing the remnants of ancient seals. They could not see through what was inside, or whether there was anything inside at all.</p><p></p><p>Just as Su Yu was about to dissuade Su Qing Yi, he had already taken out a low-grade spirit stone, picked an ancient jade box from the stall and said through gritted teeth, "I want this one."</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, good good good, a deal is a deal, no returns allowed."</p><p></p><p>Su Bin took the low-grade spirit stone, smiling and looking at Su Yu in a way that gave him goosebumps.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu hurriedly said, "I just bought some things, so I don't have any spirit stones left."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Bin immediately looked regretful. "No spirit stones? You two little fellows are so poor."</p><p></p><p>"This won't do. Wait until some other time and ask the boss if there are any suitable tasks for you to earn more spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>"That way, when the next trading fair opens next month, you'll have spirit stones to acquire ancient opportunities."</p><p></p><p>Acquire your head. Even if there were ancient opportunities, it wouldn't be their turn.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu didn't even look at those ancient jade boxes. He had seen similar things in games he played before - it was like a cash system that only whales could afford to play.</p><p></p><p>But even for whales, it would be liver-damaging. Only one in ten thousand could profit from it.</p><p></p><p>It would be fine to play around with spare cash. But now, every cultivation resource was precious to him, not to be wasted.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the trading fair, Su Qing Yi sneakily returned to his courtyard, cradling the ancient jade box. Su Yu shook his head slightly watching his back, and also returned to his own courtyard.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating in seclusion for a few days, Su Yu took out the one drop of mid-first grade demonic beast essence blood, equivalent to the middle stage of Qi Condensation realm.</p><p></p><p>He divided it into three portions and consumed them one by one to cultivate his Body Refining technique.</p><p></p><p>Half a month passed like this.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>On this day, the blood energy in Su Yu's body surged violently. Blood-colored patterns emerged on the surface of his skin, and the soaring blood energy transformed into the form of a huge alligator demon, roaring towards heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Crack crack crack!</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's flesh, bones, and skin underwent another metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>With the help of that one drop of mid-first grade demonic beast essence blood, the proficiency in cultivating this Body Refining technique increased rapidly in just one month, breaking through to the second layer.</p><p></p><p>[Technique: Willow Green Wood Mantra (First Layer, 19.2%), Alligator Demon's 108 Body Refining Technique (Second Layer, 0.3%)]</p><p></p><p>After the metamorphosis, Su Yu pondered the words with a contemplative look.</p><p></p><p>"The Willow Green Wood Mantra is limited by my spiritual root talent, so its proficiency increases slowly. But this Body Refining technique is not affected by spiritual root talent, and its proficiency increases much faster than the Willow Green Wood Mantra."</p><p></p><p>After feeling the power of the Body Refining technique, Su Yu felt that even against a Qi Condensation third layer cultivator, he would have a chance to fight.</p><p></p><p>It's just a pity that in his heart, cultivation was still the orthodox path. Although the Willow Green Wood Mantra's proficiency increased slowly, it was still acceptable.</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't be difficult to reach the second layer in a year's time.</p><p></p><p>By cultivating for thousands or tens of thousands of years this way, he didn't believe he couldn't become an immortal or a progenitor.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

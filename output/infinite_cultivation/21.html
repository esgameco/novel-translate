        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's mouth twitched, and he argued with Su Bin for a while. This old guy insisted on the fixed price of ten low-grade spirit stones, not giving any face at all. </p><p></p><p>With no choice, Su Yu took out ten low-grade spirit stones and found one buried at the bottom of the pile of ancient jade boxes. </p><p></p><p>After sensing it with closed eyes, he finally took it away.</p><p></p><p>After Su Yu left, Su Bin looked at the ten low-grade spirit stones in his hand with some thoughts: "Everything in the world has its own luck and destiny. One undeniable fact is that some people have very strong luck, while others have very poor luck."</p><p></p><p>"The ancient jade boxes are just one way to examine luck. However, this business cannot lose money. This old man doesn't have enough to lose."</p><p></p><p>The ten low-grade spirit stones just covered the cost of his efforts in collecting the ancient jade boxes everywhere.</p><p></p><p>When selling the ancient jade boxes in the clan, he was not doing it for money.</p><p></p><p>Rather, he believed in luck and destiny.  </p><p></p><p>Through the ancient jade boxes, he could see some things.</p><p></p><p>For example, the previous Su Qingyi.</p><p></p><p>And the junior he favored, Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>"He took an ancient jade box. What his luck and destiny will be like should be known in a few days." Su Bin was a bit expectant.</p><p></p><p>Thinking that Su Yu had taken one away, Su Bin turned to look at the pile of ancient jade boxes and felt a bit itchy.</p><p></p><p>"Should I open one myself?" He was an experienced gambler.</p><p></p><p>Back in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu infused his spiritual power, and the ancient taboo on the ancient jade box instantly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>He opened the jade box and frowned.</p><p></p><p>Inside was a black, flat bean-like seed.</p><p></p><p>He picked it up and looked at it: "A seed?"</p><p></p><p>The reason he had stopped earlier was that he had sensed a faint wood-attributed life aura.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through one more cycle of the Willow Wood Cultivation Technique, reaching the fourth cycle, and perfecting the Spirit Nurturing Art, he had become much more sensitive to the life auras of plants and trees.</p><p></p><p>Even through the isolation of the ancient jade box, he had detected a trace.</p><p></p><p>And now, holding this black, flat bean-like seed in his hand, Su Yu was astonished because he sensed an extraordinary life aura from it.</p><p></p><p>This seed seemed to be no ordinary thing!</p><p></p><p>However, perhaps too much time had passed, and the life aura inside this seed was very weak. Without external help, it would absolutely be impossible for it to sprout new life.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what kind of seed this is." After a moment of hesitation, Su Yu attempted to infuse the wood-attributed spiritual power of the Willow Wood Cultivation Technique into the seed in his hand.</p><p></p><p>It was not until he had consumed nearly sixty percent of his spiritual power that Su Yu stopped.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the aura has strengthened a little bit."</p><p></p><p>Sensing that the life aura of the seed had slightly increased, Su Yu could not help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>This was something he had exchanged for ten low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>If this seed was spoiled, he would feel regretful for quite a while.</p><p></p><p>He put the seed back into the jade box and stored it in his qiankun bag to slowly nourish and restore it later. Su Yu then sat cross-legged, circulating his cultivation technique to recover his spiritual power. After his state recovered, he began practicing the Myriad Wood Vine Art and the Spirit Devouring Art.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Wood Vine Art could instantly produce vines like tree branches to entangle enemies.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Devouring Art was a bit sinister, able to absorb others' spiritual power or mental energy, intensifying the enemy's consumption.</p><p></p><p>If the enemy's spiritual power and mental energy were completely consumed, even their life force could be absorbed by the Spirit Devouring Art.</p><p></p><p>Until their life span was exhausted and they died.</p><p></p><p>This technique was very difficult but extremely powerful. Even for high-level cultivators, the Spirit Devouring Art was still one of the most feared wood-attributed techniques at that level.</p><p></p><p>Ten days later, Su Yu gained an entry-level understanding of the Myriad Wood Vine Art.</p><p></p><p>A month later, Su Yu gained an entry-level understanding of the Spirit Devouring Art.</p><p></p><p>After practicing these two techniques, at the end of the month, Su Yu invited an alchemist over.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Master Su Changyu gathered with his three senior disciples, and they left ten low-grade spirit stones for Master Su Changyu. </p><p></p><p>The next day, Su Yu went to Yunshan Town Market following Su Jingbang when the medicine garden was delivering goods.</p><p></p><p>Not long after Su Yu left Cangshan, the Lin family received news.</p><p></p><p>"That kid who gave the Beast Luring Powder formula to the Su family is going to Yunshan Town to become a pill refining apprentice?"</p><p></p><p>"Old Five, keep watching him. It's not easy for us to make a move in the Su family's medicine garden, but once he leaves the Su family, he'll eventually be alone."  </p><p></p><p>"Kill him and take back the Beast Luring Powder formula."</p><p></p><p>The Lin family's great elder Lin Kui said through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>One person from the Lin family followed behind Su Jingbang and the others, quietly heading towards Yunshan Town Market.</p><p></p><p>The Su family had just acquired a first-grade spirit vein but had not yet transformed it into the family's strength. The Lin family's power was still on par with the Su family's.</p><p></p><p>If the current situation could not be changed, the longer time passed, the more dangerous it would become for the Lin family.</p><p></p><p>If the Su family's strength soared in the future, the Lin family would either face annihilation or have to flee Jiangcheng to avoid the Su family from afar.</p><p></p><p>They, the Lin family, did not have much time left!</p><p></p><p>Once again arriving at Yunshan Town Market.</p><p></p><p>There was no change here. Along the way, Su Yu and the others did not encounter any bandits. Most of the time, order was quite stable within the domain of the Yunjiansect. If powerful bandits emerged, the Yunjiansect would issue a mission to hunt them down.</p><p></p><p>Powerless bandits naturally did not dare show themselves when they saw the group of eleven cultivators that Su Yu was part of.</p><p></p><p>Entering the market town and walking through the bustling street of cultivators, they arrived at the Su Family Pill Pavilion. The second elder, Su Yun, was the same as before.</p><p></p><p>His hair was white, his forehead had a few horizontal lines, and his appearance was upright with a hint of an unapproachable coldness.</p><p></p><p>After receiving the goods from Su Jingbang's hands, this time Su Yun looked towards his junior Su Yu. He had not returned to Jiangcheng, but he knew of the changes in the Su family.</p><p></p><p>He had already obtained the Beast Luring Powder formula a year ago.</p><p></p><p>And he had successfully sold it to the Yunjiansect and various other forces within the Yunjiansect's domain.</p><p></p><p>This single formula alone could bring the Su family a pure profit income of over two thousand low-grade spirit stones every year.</p><p></p><p>Su Yun looked at Su Yu, his brows slightly furrowed as he said, "Weren't you cultivating the Willow Green Wood Technique?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu respectfully replied, "That was before, but now I've switched to cultivating another wood-attribute technique."</p><p></p><p>Su Yun was slightly surprised upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The Willow Green Wood Technique was not bad among the wood-attribute techniques at the Qi Refining realm!</p><p></p><p>It could be cultivated to the ninth level of the Qi Refining realm, a top-tier Qi Refining technique!</p><p></p><p>Su Yu obviously knew this point, yet he still chose to switch to another wood-attribute technique, which meant that technique was stronger than the Willow Green Wood Technique!</p><p></p><p>Su Yun nodded without further inquiry, saying, "It's good that it's still a wood-attribute technique. Stay here first, and starting tomorrow, you'll study pill refining under me."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Yu bowed respectfully, "Yes, Master."</p><p></p><p>After sending Su Yu off to tidy up his room and settle in, Su Jingbang looked at Su Yun and laughed, "Congratulations to the second elder for gaining an outstanding disciple."</p><p></p><p>Su Yun frowned and said, "I don't know how far he can go, but I will teach him wholeheartedly. In my opinion, the family master should have kept him by his side. To become a qualified heir and support the family's growth, what's needed is not just a pill refiner."</p><p></p><p>However, Su Jingbang shook his head, "An heir can be a pill refiner, but not just a pill refiner."</p><p></p><p>"He's only twenty years old; his life is still long. He can experience being a pharmacist, a pill refiner, and even travel with the fourth elder."</p><p></p><p>"The second elder should give the young some time to grow."</p><p></p><p>Su Yun was silent for a moment, then nodded, "You're right."</p><p></p><p>However, he did not know that this disciple's future pill refining skills would reach an incredible, heaven-defying level.</p><p></p><p>Compared to cultivation, improving these side proficiencies would be easier.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

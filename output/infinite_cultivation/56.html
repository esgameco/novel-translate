        <h1>Chapter 56</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Both beast tamers successfully broke through to the second-tier demonic beasts. Yuzhuan'er's eyes lit up as she looked at Su Yu with anticipation, saying, "I still have a first-tier peak beast tamer, the Azure Python, that is about to break through to the second tier." </p><p></p><p>"When it's breaking through, could you please watch over it with me?"</p><p></p><p>Yuzhuan'er continued, "The Fire Ape and Black Scale Eagle have both broken through to the second tier, so you'll definitely need second-tier low-grade Beast Pellets."</p><p></p><p>"When the time comes, come find me. I'll give you a discount."</p><p></p><p>"Always 20% off, no, 30% off."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu had unintentionally revealed his terrifying healing abilities with his spiritual power just now, which made Yuzhuan'er extremely envious. </p><p></p><p>With Su Yu's help, the success rate of her beast tamers breaking through could increase by 10-20%!</p><p></p><p>She couldn't let this opportunity slip away.</p><p></p><p>When Su Yu heard about the second-tier low-grade Beast Pellets and saw the wealthy Yuzhuan'er in front of him from the 'flowing with oil' Yu Family, he couldn't help but show a warm smile.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the rich lady before him, he said, "Of course I can watch over it for you, and no need for a discount. I'm already a second-tier low-grade pill refiner myself and can refine them."</p><p></p><p>"From now on, if you need any pellets, just come find me."</p><p></p><p>Yuzhuan'er was dumbstruck: "???"</p><p></p><p>Looking at Su Yu, whose cultivation was still only at the eighth level of Qi Condensation, she asked in astonishment, "You...you're already a second-tier low-grade pill refiner!?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu nodded, "This news is not known to outsiders yet, only you know."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yuzhuan'er was stunned, her pretty face blushing as her heart raced.</p><p></p><p>What did that mean?</p><p></p><p>Not known to outsiders? </p><p></p><p>Only telling her?</p><p></p><p>"I...I'll go back first, and let you know when I'm prepared." Yuzhuan'er fled in a panic.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu watched her leaving figure, feeling a bit puzzled. They hadn't finished discussing yet, why did she run off?</p><p></p><p>Su Yu had deeply considered before deciding to reveal to Yuzhuan'er that he was a second-tier low-grade pill refiner.</p><p></p><p>The Fire Ape and Black Scale Eagle had both successfully broken through to the second-tier early demonic beasts stage.</p><p></p><p>Plus, his body refining technique was about to break through to the tenth level, happening within one or two months at the fastest or slowest.</p><p></p><p>This gave him the confidence to tell Yuzhuan'er about being a second-tier low-grade pill refiner.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he needed to find a stable and reliable source of income in Bai Yue Xian City.</p><p></p><p>The Yu Family's strength, power and resources were considerable. Along with his relationship with the Yu Family's young lady Yuzhuan'er, it was a great choice.</p><p></p><p>He could probably get some work from the Yu Family first to resolve his food and lodging issues.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu shook his head slightly, gathered his belongings, stored the Fire Ape and Black Scale Eagle beast tamers into his beast taming bag, and headed out, "Need to prepare the materials for the second-tier low-grade Beast Pellets."</p><p></p><p>Outside, Yuzhuan'er was walking back with the old lady Huang Haihuang.</p><p></p><p>Huang Haihuang said in a low voice, "Young Miss, although Su Yu was born into a small family clan with unimpressive spiritual roots, his potential is remarkable. Now he even has two second-tier early demonic beasts under his control."</p><p></p><p>"If he assists you, Young Miss may have a great chance of gaining your father's approval to become the sole heir of the third house."</p><p></p><p>"No way."</p><p></p><p>Yuzhuan'er said, "He's not someone willing to get involved in trouble. Think about how many years he spent in Cloud Mountain Town?"</p><p></p><p>"Aside from necessary matters, he hardly ever left Cloud Mountain Town more than five times!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Yuzhuan'er chose her words carefully after a moment, then said, "He's...too steady."  </p><p></p><p>"Previously, when their family clan's Purple Gold Sand spirit vein was being eyed by the Bai and Huang Families, he didn't even get involved."</p><p></p><p>"And now, he's come alone to Bai Yue Xian City, leaving his family behind."</p><p></p><p>"He's been here for over a year, but he hasn't even..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"He has never even left the inner domain of Baiyue Xian City, let alone Baiyue Xian City itself."</p><p></p><p>"You still want to involve him in the troubles of the family?"</p><p></p><p>Huang Haiming was speechless upon hearing this: "..."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, she seemed to have overlooked Su Yu's personality. Apart from necessary matters, he basically never stepped out of the main gate or the side gate. </p><p></p><p>It seemed like he was afraid that going out would be troublesome, as if it would lead to his death.</p><p></p><p>This was not ordinary cowardice—cough, it should be said as the young lady put it, he was extraordinarily steady.</p><p></p><p>To have such a person intervene in the Yu family's troubles was indeed difficult. </p><p></p><p>It was even an impossible thing.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Huang Haiming said, "But what if the family master still wants the young lady to form a marriage alliance?"</p><p></p><p>"Unless I die," Yu Ernu said coldly, but in her mind, she pictured Su Yu's handsome face that hadn't changed in dozens of years.</p><p></p><p>She had fled to Baiyue Xian City because she didn't want to get involved in the troubles within the family.</p><p></p><p>Thinking carefully, Yu Ernu suddenly envied Su Yu's lifestyle and state of mind a little.</p><p></p><p>Plain and simple is the truth.</p><p></p><p>That kind of life is actually quite good.</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, through Huang Haiming, Yu Ernu passed on some of the Yu family's pill medicine needs to Su Yu, including the Yu family's unique spirit core pill formulas.</p><p></p><p>These needs, estimated over a year, could probably allow Su Yu to earn two to three thousand low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>As for the top-tier first-grade dragon eagle puppet beast, Yu Ernu sent it back to the Yu family.</p><p></p><p>After all, that thing had used six thousand low-grade spirit stones from the family, so naturally it had to be sent back to the family.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu went to the market streets a few streets away to purchase second-grade low-grade materials for the Hundred Beast Pill, and after completing that,</p><p></p><p>he walked to the innermost part of the market, where a three-story building identical to the Yunshan Book Pavilion came into view.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu walked in familiarly and found the miscellaneous book section, flipping through all sorts of complicated books and ancient texts.</p><p></p><p>After more than two hours, Su Yu's eyes suddenly focused.</p><p></p><p>He saw recorded in the ancient text in his hand a technique: the Tao Body Puppet Technique.</p><p></p><p>By cutting off a strand of the soul and attaching it to a puppet, one could control the puppet to walk around. Although the strength was limited to that of the puppet and consistent with the puppet's grade, apart from that, it was basically no different from the main body.</p><p></p><p>It was a minor technique from the ancient times used for purposes such as exploration and visiting relatives.</p><p></p><p>But for ordinary cultivators, not everyone could successfully cultivate such a technique.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was cutting the soul, fusing into the puppet to refine it into a Tao body puppet, or later recovering from the soul trauma, every step was a difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it would be easier to cultivate such a technique after reaching the stage of separating the spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Good stuff."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's eyes lit up. While this technique might be difficult for others to cultivate, it would not be difficult for him.</p><p></p><p>And once he successfully cultivated the Tao Body Puppet Technique, it would be like a divine ability for someone like him.</p><p></p><p>The main body could stay put, and for anything that needed to be done, he could send the Tao body puppet.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he also had the Golden Cicada Technique, specifically for cultivating the spirit and soul.</p><p></p><p>The trauma suffered from cutting the soul could be gradually recovered by the Golden Cicada Technique. Even if the Tao body puppet was destroyed and that strand of soul perished, it wouldn't matter.</p><p></p><p>What a divine technique!</p><p></p><p>Su Yu took that ancient text to the counter to pay, but the shopkeeper was not the old man from the Yunshan Book Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>And the price for ancient texts here was the same as at the Yunshan Book Pavilion—fifty low-grade spirit stones per book.</p><p></p><p>After paying and obtaining the complete ancient text, Su Yu left the market and returned to his courtyard.</p><p></p><p>While continuing to cultivate and attempt to break through in his body refining technique, he also studied the Tao Body Puppet Technique.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

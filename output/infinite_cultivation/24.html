        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"Screech!"</p><p></p><p>Under the excruciating pain, the Zuo Shan Diao (a type of powerful bird monster) began to fight back desperately, letting out angry cries that echoed through the dense forest. However, Su Zhi, Su Yu and the others had already retreated the moment they attacked. The Zuo Shan Diao, still not recovered from the ice talisman, wanted to counterattack but its speed was a bit slow. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, Su Zhi's mid-grade flying sword was extremely sharp. It pierced through the bloody hole caused by the Broken Cloud Arrow, stabbing into the Zuo Shan Diao. Even though the Zuo Shan Diao reacted and forcibly trapped the flying sword, this strike had already severely injured it.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, Su Yu and the other three also unleashed their magical artifacts, further worsening the Zuo Shan Diao's injuries.  </p><p></p><p>And in its furious attempt to counterattack, the effects of the mind-muddling potion within the Zuo Shan Diao took effect faster.</p><p></p><p>After persisting for less than a hundred breaths, with Su Zhi's group continuously blocking the Zuo Shan Diao's escape, its huge body collapsed to the ground in a daze.</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi did not approach it, instead using her flying sword to directly sever the Zuo Shan Diao's head, only then did she breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Li Shinan and Chen Sisi clicked their tongues secretly, watching the dead Zuo Shan Diao as they retrieved their own magical artifacts.  </p><p></p><p>They felt a bit dazed, yet also a tinge of dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Was it really that easy to hunt down the Zuo Shan Diao?</p><p></p><p>This thought had just surfaced in Li Shinan and Chen Sisi's minds when their gazes fell on Su Yu, shaking their heads inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The Zuo Shan Diao's death was well-deserved.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed powerful.  </p><p></p><p>But facing the successive attacks of top-grade first-level talismans, with Su Zhi, at the seventh level of Qi Refining realm, taking charge.</p><p></p><p>Add the mind-muddling potion with its wondrous effects—</p><p></p><p>It would be strange if the Zuo Shan Diao didn't die!</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, the Zuo Shan Diao wasn't killed by them, but was beaten to death with money.</p><p></p><p>Four top-grade first-level talismans, worth nearly two hundred low-grade spirit stones. The Ice Talisman with its extraordinary effects was very expensive.  </p><p></p><p>Factoring in the equally formidable mind-muddling potion, a late-stage first-level Zuo Shan Diao was probably only worth that much.</p><p></p><p>The huge Zuo Shan Diao corpse, with wings spanning over ten zhang (Chinese length unit), was covered in black feathers that glistened like cold iron.</p><p></p><p>Its sharp claws, beak, feathers and more were all premium materials.</p><p></p><p>However, what Su Yu was interested in was only the late-stage first-level demonic beast essence blood. The Zuo Shan Diao had sixty-three drops of essence blood, worth around one hundred and sixty to one hundred and seventy low-grade spirit stones.  </p><p></p><p>Originally, Su Yu wanted to use spirit stones to take it all, but Li Shinan, Chen Sisi and Su Qingyi refused, directly letting Su Yu divide the demonic beast essence blood.</p><p></p><p>In this hunt for the Zuo Shan Diao, aside from Su Zhi, the one who contributed the most was Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>Hearing their words, Su Yu smiled: "Then I won't stand on ceremony."</p><p></p><p>The remaining materials were handed over to Su Qingyi to process, to be divided later with Li Shinan and Chen Sisi.</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi put away the Zuo Shan Diao's head, happily saying: "I owe you all a favor."</p><p></p><p>Then, looking at Su Yu, she said: "Little Yu, those two Broken Cloud Arrow talismans count as mine. You've already helped me a great deal."</p><p></p><p>This hunt for the Zuo Shan Diao did turn out to be unexpectedly easy.  </p><p></p><p>However, this hunting method was inadvisable, as the approach was too extravagant. If not for the mission requirements, acting this way would not be cost-effective.</p><p></p><p>The group left the mountain happily, heading back towards the Yungjian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Not long after.</p><p></p><p>A figure appeared at the place where the five had hunted the Zuo Shan Diao, his expression constantly changing.</p><p></p><p>"A Zuo Shan Diao with a presence comparable to the eighth level of Qi Refining, yet it was hunted by those few brats in less than half an incense stick's time?"</p><p></p><p>"And they didn't even get injured much, with little consumption of resources."</p><p></p><p>Originally, after sensing that Su Zhi and the others wanted to hunt the Zuo Shan Diao, he was quite pleased.  </p><p></p><p>Thinking he could wait for Su Zhi's group and the Zuo Shan Diao to injure each other, then swoop in like an opportunistic bird to easily claim a late-stage first-level demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>Little did he expect Su Zhi's group to be so formidable, taking down the powerful Zuo Shan Diao in just half an incense stick's time.  </p><p></p><p>Without getting injured!</p><p></p><p>In this situation, even looking at them scared him, how could he dare show up?</p><p></p><p>"Damn it."</p><p></p><p>Cursing inwardly, this person was unwilling to watch as Su Zhi's group left, thinking to himself: "I can only wait for another opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"As for that Su Zhi, with her considerable strength, I can give up on her."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"But Su Yu is only at the fourth level of Qi Refining realm. As long as I seize an opportunity, I can take him down."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph."</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi didn't care whether Su Yu could join the inner sect by completing missions. </p><p></p><p>After finishing the mission to hunt the Zuo Shan Diao and returning to the Fang Shi Dan Ge, recalling the process of hunting the Zuo Shan Diao this time, Su Yu felt an unprecedented sense of clarity and relaxation.</p><p></p><p>He had a feeling of exhilaration.</p><p></p><p>He smashed it with talisman papers.</p><p>Then offered it the Confusion Liquid.</p><p>One after another magical treasures were used to attack it.</p><p>The Zuo Shan Diao was completely powerless to resist and was easily hunted down by the group.</p><p></p><p>This combat mode opened Su Yu's eyes.</p><p>It was like finding the path he should take in the future.</p><p>This mission wasn't as difficult as he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>"That Frost Talisman was very effective, quite useful. With this, combined with other talisman papers or spells and magical treasures to attack, it would be hard for the enemy to escape."</p><p></p><p>"Then use medicine to subdue them. Perfect."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu praised inwardly.</p><p></p><p>However—</p><p></p><p>When Su Yu came back to his senses from this state, he felt something was off.</p><p>Why did he think this way?</p><p>With his current foundation and the Proficiency Panel system, relying on all kinds of treasures to finally kill the enemy should not be his first choice.</p><p></p><p>The path he should take is to persevere as much as possible, cultivating his attainments and body refining abilities day by day.</p><p>In the end—</p><p>Use absolute overwhelming power to slap the enemy to death.</p><p></p><p>Just like with the Zuo Shan Diao this time, if he had the Foundation Establishment realm or the equivalent second-stage Body Refining realm.</p><p>Then dealing with the Zuo Shan Diao would have no danger or difficulty at all.</p><p></p><p>Isn't this what he should be pursuing?</p><p></p><p>"This is how it should be, I almost went down the wrong path." Su Yu's gaze slightly focused.</p><p></p><p>In that case, he had to think about how to earn some resources next to maintain his peaceful cultivation days in Fang Shi.</p><p></p><p>Back at the Dan Ge, Su Yu resumed his daily routine of cultivating the Cang Mu Sui Lun Gong, Body Refining techniques, spells, as well as following his master Su Yun to learn pill refining and practice to accumulate proficiency.</p><p></p><p>As for the seed he brought from home, with Su Yu nourishing it with spiritual power every day, the seed gradually became a bit rounder and its life force slightly stronger.</p><p></p><p>Another month later.</p><p></p><p>With the assistance of the first-level late-stage demonic beast's essence blood, Su Yu's Crocodile Demon's One Hundred and Eight Form Body Refining technique naturally broke through to the sixth level.</p><p></p><p>After the Body Refining technique broke through, Su Yu felt that the previously full core of power accumulated from the Blood Devouring Moon Technique had emptied a large section, which needed to be refilled.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Yu, I know the whereabouts of a Bi Lin Mang that just broke through to the late first level. Do you want to take it down together?" Su Qing Yi found Su Yu and said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Yu shook his head: "No, I'm only at the fourth level of Qi Refining realm. How dare I provoke a late first-level demonic beast?"</p><p></p><p>No matter how Su Qing Yi persuaded him, he couldn't convince Su Yu to go out together. In the end, he only exchanged some Confusion Liquid from Su Yu and went to the wilderness to hunt the Bi Lin Mang himself.</p><p></p><p>His talent in pill refining was far inferior to Su Yu's. Recently, Su Qing Yi had shifted his focus to hunting demonic beasts in order to accumulate cultivation resources to sustain his own practice.</p><p></p><p>Two days later.</p><p></p><p>Su Qing Yi returned from the hunt, though slightly injured, but successfully hunted a late first-level Bi Lin Mang.</p><p>He gave half of the Bi Lin Mang's essence blood to Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Su Yu thought his days in Fang Shi could remain peaceful like this, but half a month after he broke through the sixth level of the Body Refining technique, he heard some bad news.</p><p></p><p>The young master of the Lin family who had previously joined the Cloud Sword Sect, Lin Dan Lang, married into the Bai family of Feng Cheng as a son-in-law, wedding the over 400 jin heavy second young lady, in exchange for the support of the Bai family of Feng Cheng.</p><p></p><p>The Bai family of Feng Cheng was a cultivating force with two Elders at the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 36</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After much thought, Su Yu decided to give talisman papers. He knew Su Qing Yi and Chen Si Si, so he would give them two top-grade first-level Fire Cloud Arrow talisman papers. </p><p></p><p>"Compared to elixir pills, these may be able to save their lives in this critical moment," Su Yu thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had materials for making Fire Cloud Arrow talismans in his qiankun bag. Although he had used up all the Fire Cloud Arrow talismans when dealing with the Golden Eagle Ghost previously, he still had nearly ten days, so refining two talisman papers would not be difficult.</p><p></p><p>He cultivated the Cypress Wood Yearly Cycle technique, body refining methods, and made talismans in his spare time. </p><p></p><p>The young Earth Fire Ape was released from his beast pouch, and fed a few perfect low-grade first-level Beast Pills every day.</p><p></p><p>Although only less than three years old, this creature's aura had already reached the peak of the early first level spirit beast realm, comparable to a cultivator who had just broken through to the third level of Qi Refining.  </p><p></p><p>At this rate of growth, in one or two more years the Earth Fire Ape would become a mid first level spirit beast.</p><p></p><p>This growth rate was at least twice as fast as an ordinary Earth Fire Ape.</p><p></p><p>In addition to feeding the Earth Fire Ape, every day Su Yu also nourished the seed he obtained from the ancient jade box. After three to four years of nourishing, the seed had now fully recovered, brimming with vitality.</p><p></p><p>On the second day after Su Yu returned, as he was infusing spiritual power into the seed as usual, the seed suddenly emitted a dazzling emerald green light and fell from Su Yu's hand onto the ground.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the seed sprouted and grew rapidly. Within just a few dozen breaths, a tree trunk one zhang tall appeared, ancient and gnarled, covered in palm-sized scale-like patterns exuding an aura of antiquity.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Su Yu was dazed for a moment, what kind of seed was this?</p><p></p><p>Before he could figure it out, a red flower bloomed on the tree. As the petals opened over the course of more than an hour, the room became filled with a dense fragrance of pollen and flowers.</p><p></p><p>When Su Yu inhaled this pollen, the latent inner energy of his body refining technique suddenly boiled over.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, his soul felt ethereal, as if it had left his body's constraints and floated up to look down at his own body.</p><p></p><p>"So comfortable, what kind of seed is this?" Su Yu was extremely surprised.</p><p></p><p>He could feel his spiritual sense rapidly expanding.  </p><p></p><p>Not even half an hour later...</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The Alligator One Hundred Eight Body Refining Technique, which originally would have taken at least a few more years to break through, now went from the sixth level straight to the seventh.</p><p></p><p>And only half of the dense pollen fragrance had been consumed.</p><p></p><p>Another half hour later, the pollen fragrance was completely consumed. The body refining technique's seventh level proficiency increased to 44.7%.</p><p></p><p>The flower petals scattered with the wind, turning to ashes. </p><p></p><p>Then the entire tree withered into ashes as well.</p><p></p><p>Another flattened seed dropped down from within.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu reached out and caught it, feeling delighted. This time the seed sprouted and bloomed, allowing him to save at least five to six years of time on his body refining.</p><p></p><p>"The seventh level of body refining is comparable to the seventh level of Qi Refining."</p><p></p><p>He sensed the changes to his spiritual sense again.</p><p></p><p>"My spiritual sense has expanded by a full two tenths."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's expression changed slightly. His Qi Refining cultivation level had not changed, but his spiritual sense had grown much stronger, meaning his foundation was more stable and profound.</p><p></p><p>When he broke through to higher levels in the future, the increases would be even greater.</p><p></p><p>Like a towering pagoda rising from flat ground, this two tenths expansion of spiritual sense represented a new metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>"Not only does it benefit my cultivation, but the expansion of spiritual sense has an even greater impact on auxiliary disciplines like pill refining, talisman making, and array formations," Su Yu was delighted as his gaze fell on the seed.</p><p></p><p>The new seed was slightly larger than before, with decent vitality.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>However, for it to sprout again would likely take some time of nourishment. </p><p></p><p>After adjusting his state, Su Yu picked up his talisman pen and began drawing today's Fire Cloud Arrow talisman. After applying the blood essence of a top-grade fire-attribute demonic beast, he put it on the talisman paper. It was completed in one stroke, like an array formation, or a naturally formed talisman pattern.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu infused it with his spiritual power, spiritual sense, and even his spiritual aura, fusing them with the brushstrokes and talisman. </p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>It took more than two full hours.</p><p></p><p>When the final stroke stopped, the talisman emitted a dazzling red radiance. The spiritual energy of the heavens and earth converged and was absorbed by the talisman, enhancing its aura.</p><p></p><p>After a short while, the heavenly and earthly energies calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu looked a bit pale, having expended over eighty percent of his spiritual power, spiritual sense, and aura. But he was very delighted looking at the talisman before him.</p><p></p><p>"A premium-grade talisman, I actually succeeded!" Su Yu laughed happily.</p><p></p><p>Just like spirit pills, any grade of talisman was divided into three quality levels: ordinary, premium, and perfect, describing its quality.</p><p></p><p>However, unlike spirit pills where the same materials could refine different qualities, talismans were different.</p><p></p><p>Talismans required corresponding materials. For example, a premium top-grade talisman required premium top-grade talisman paper of better quality.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, premium talismans were rare, as drawing them was much more difficult.</p><p></p><p>As for perfect-grade talismans, that depended on opportunity and luck. Materials, state, and skill were all indispensable, making them far rarer than perfect spirit pills.</p><p></p><p>This premium top-grade Fire Cloud Arrow talisman was the first top-grade premium talisman Su Yu had successfully crafted.</p><p></p><p>A success on the first try!</p><p></p><p>Carefully sensing the talisman's aura, Su Yu thought inwardly, "It's much stronger than an ordinary Fire Cloud Arrow talisman. Even against a ninth-level Qi Condensation cultivator, used well, it could severely injure or even kill them."</p><p></p><p>Reading this, Su Yu looked forward to more powerful talismans, like those ancient ones: the Fire Thunder Talisman, Fire Dragon Talisman, Fire Thunder Sword Talisman.</p><p></p><p>If he could create even stronger talismans based on those, perhaps he could instantly slay ninth-level Qi Condensation cultivators.</p><p></p><p>With a few days until the wedding, Su Yu continued drawing Fire Cloud Arrow talismans, using up the five premium material sets he had. He obtained three premium Fire Cloud Arrow talismans, a sixty percent success rate, raising his proficiency to 52%.</p><p></p><p>He also successfully drew four ordinary Fire Cloud Arrow talismans.</p><p></p><p>Exhausting all his prepared materials.</p><p></p><p>Before Su Qingyi and Chen Sixian's wedding, Su Yu presented his gift.</p><p></p><p>In Su Yu's view, this Cloud Sword Sect disciple Chen Sixian was quite decent, with an eight or nine out of ten appearance. Possessing an ice spiritual root, her talents surpassed Su Qingyi's by a level or two. </p><p></p><p>However, Su Qingyi's cultivation progress was not slow, as if he had his own opportunities.</p><p></p><p>The two seemed well-matched now.</p><p></p><p>The wedding was grand, with many guests from the Chen family. Cultivating clans and cultivators friendly with the Su family also came to Cangshan Mountain. The wedding banquet lasted three days before dispersing.</p><p></p><p>After the wedding, the family patriarch Su Peng found Su Yu to discuss having him represent the Su family in handling matters with the Chen family's Purple Gold Sand Mine, as a form of experience.</p><p></p><p>But Su Yu declined, citing focusing on cultivation and pill refinement as the reason.</p><p></p><p>Experience?</p><p></p><p>Too dangerous! Wait until he broke through to the Foundation Establishment realm, or even formed his Nascent Soul, before taking such a task!</p><p></p><p>In the end, this matter was handed to Su Qingyi.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu followed his master Su Yun, Su Zhi, and the newly-wedded Chen Sixian back to Yunshan Town. Su Zhi and Chen Sixian returned to their sects.</p><p></p><p>In the time that followed, Su Yu focused wholeheartedly on cultivation in Yunshan Town.</p><p></p><p>He would occasionally pay attention to the situation between his family and the Chen family, as well as the movements of the Bai family in Fengcheng.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

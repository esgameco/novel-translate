        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, Su Yu had already been at the Medicine Garden for half a month. </p><p></p><p>He had memorized all the books given by Master Su Changyu, and had also successfully cultivated the Spirit Nourishing Technique, although the progress was slow. In half a month, his proficiency had reached 4.1%.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the Wutong Qingmu Mantra and the Body Refining Technique had also improved, with the proficiency increasing slightly faster than when he was at the Su Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>However, after reaching the third level of the Body Refining Technique, the difficulty of improving proficiency was greater than Su Yu had estimated.  </p><p></p><p>To break through to the fourth level, two to three months was just wishful thinking. He now expected to break through the fourth level of the Body Refining Technique within half a year.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if he could have some demonic beast essence blood to assist, the time could be reduced.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, after becoming a medicine disciple at the Medicine Field, Su Yu's monthly allowance increased significantly. Additionally, there would occasionally be rock rat demonic beasts attacking and being killed here, allowing him to trade for more demonic beast essence blood.</p><p></p><p>After half a month of free time, Su Yu began to follow Su Changyu to learn about cultivating spirit medicines, as well as to study his understanding of the habits and nature of spirit medicines.</p><p></p><p>After a few days, there was also a trading fair held within the Medicine Field Manor.</p><p></p><p>At the trading fair, Su Yu saw Su Qingyi, whom he hadn't seen for over half a year, and realized that Su Qingyi's cultivation had reached the third level of the Qi Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>To break through from the first level to the third level of the Qi Refining Realm in just over a year, this speed surprised Su Yu a little.</p><p></p><p>Although Su Qingyi had a medium-grade spirit root talent, this rate of improvement was too fast, wasn't it?</p><p></p><p>He himself estimated that it would take him over a year and a half to break through the third level of the Wutong Qingmu Mantra.</p><p></p><p>Su Qingyi had set up a stall, and the youthful naivety he had half a year ago had largely faded. He no longer looked like a pampered young master of a family. At his stall, he also had demonic beast essence blood for sale and trade, which Su Yu happened to need.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing Su Yu, Su Qingyi didn't seem surprised. After asking about Su Yu's needs, he smiled and said, "I also have mid-grade first-level demonic beast essence blood. Two low-grade spirit stones, and I'll give you five drops."</p><p></p><p>"Okay," Su Yu naturally wouldn't refuse, as this was a discounted price.</p><p></p><p>Su Qingyi enthusiastically said, "There will be demonic beasts appearing at the Medicine Field during this period. If you encounter any trouble you can't resolve, you can find me."</p><p></p><p>"If you discover any traces of demonic beasts, you can also find me. We'll share the spoils then."</p><p></p><p>From Su Qingyi's demeanor, it seemed he had already adapted to the environment of the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>From him, Su Yu also saw a bit of the street vendor low-level cultivator boss NPC template he had encountered in previous cultivation games.</p><p></p><p>After chatting idly with him for a while, Su Yu left the trading fair and returned to his own room.</p><p></p><p>With his current third-level Body Refining Technique, he could refine one drop of mid-grade first-level demonic beast essence blood at a time.</p><p></p><p>While cultivating the Body Refining Technique, Su Yu thought of the point Su Qingyi had mentioned: "Perhaps I could find a way to hunt the rock rats myself, earn some pocket money, and obtain some essence blood to cultivate the Body Refining Technique."</p><p></p><p>With the power of the third level of the Body Refining Technique from the 'One Hundred and Eight Alligator Demon Body Refining Techniques', he wouldn't be afraid even if he encountered a mid-grade first-level rock rat comparable to the fourth level of the Qi Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he knew a method to hunt and kill rock rats without having to take action himself.</p><p></p><p>In the early quests of the previous cultivation game, there were quests to lure and hunt rock rats by making a special beast-luring powder.</p><p></p><p>That beast-luring powder made specifically for rock rats could lure them out. Once the rock rats ate the powder, they would fall into a coma, allowing them to be slaughtered at will.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu didn't know if other cultivation forces understood this method, but the Su Family, who had never come into contact with spirit veins or rock rats, probably didn't know about it.</p><p></p><p>"Blue Orchid, Rosemary, Cloud Shadow Grass, and Wutong Oil are all just common ingredients that can be gathered at the Medicine Field," Su Yu pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>He immediately set to work.</p><p></p><p>After completing the Body Refining Technique cultivation, Su Yu began collecting the materials for the beast-luring powder.</p><p></p><p>It only cost one low-grade spirit stone, and he had gathered enough materials for five doses of the beast-luring powder.</p><p></p><p>He simply ground the five doses of materials into powder and stored them in jade bottles, thinking to himself, "I'll try it out tonight."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It was still early, so he followed Su Changyu to the medicine fields to complete today's task. </p><p></p><p>Using spirit cultivation techniques to nurture spirit medicines, using spirit perception techniques to sense the growth state of the spirit medicines, and practicing to integrate the knowledge he had previously memorized.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Su Yu had learned the spirit perception technique in such a short time, Su Changyu sighed: "Little Yu, you are the most talented person I have seen in so many years. None of your three senior martial brothers have been able to comprehend the spirit perception technique until now."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu said: "I just got lucky. Last year when I followed the patriarch to the Yunjianzong to participate in the entry disciple test, my score on the second spiritual aptitude section was only average."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, I only have a lower-grade spirit root. It took me over a year of cultivation to break through from the first level of Qi Refining to the second level."</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, please don't praise me too much, or I'll lose my motivation to cultivate."</p><p></p><p>"You, alright." Su Changyu's honest expression froze when he heard this, and then he chuckled and didn't say anything more about Su Yu being the most talented.</p><p></p><p>However, he paid more attention to Su Yu and had Su Yu follow him to study every day.</p><p></p><p>In the evening.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu went to a remote medicine field, placed some spirit rice mixed with beast-luring powder in five spots, and then left the area to quietly wait.</p><p></p><p>After more than two hours, when it was deep into the night, Su Yu went to check and found that the five portions of beast-luring powder had successfully lured two earth rodent beasts.</p><p></p><p>One was less than a foot in size, probably only at the first or second level of Qi Refining, just a small demon beast. The other was nearly two feet in size, a mid-grade first-level demon beast.</p><p></p><p>"Scored big." Su Yu's heart rejoiced when he saw the large demon beast.</p><p></p><p>He went over, grabbed its head, and viciously twisted it. With the terrifying immense strength of the third level of the Alligator Demon's 108 Body Refining Techniques, he directly twisted its head around in a circle until all the aura on its body disappeared.</p><p></p><p>After dealing with the large rodent demon, Su Yu slapped the remaining small rodent demon with one palm. With a dull thump, the small rodent demon's brain matter splattered out.</p><p></p><p>He destroyed the remaining three portions of spirit rice mixed with beast-luring powder, then quietly returned while carrying the two earth rodent beasts.</p><p></p><p>Because the beast-luring powder had a time limit of three hours before becoming ineffective, the remaining three portions were useless, so he destroyed them to leave no trace.</p><p></p><p>Back in his room, Su Yu skinned and drained the blood from the two earth rodent demon beasts.</p><p></p><p>Demon beast essence blood refers to the blood from a demon beast's heart - the essence containing the demon beast's full power and its condensed source of strength. The amount is not much.</p><p></p><p>From the small rodent demon, Su Yu only obtained twenty-three drops of early first-grade demon beast essence blood.</p><p></p><p>From the large rodent demon, he obtained forty-one drops of mid first-grade demon beast essence blood.</p><p></p><p>At the cost of one lower-grade spirit stone for the beast-luring powder, he obtained materials worth around thirty lower-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"With this demon beast essence blood to aid my cultivation, I may be able to break through to the fourth level of the Body Refining Techniques in just two or three months," Su Yu thought happily.</p><p></p><p>What made him even happier was that the game quest from his previous life to lure and hunt earth rodent beasts actually allowed him to successfully hunt earth rodent beasts in this cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the proficiency panel, he had gained another cheat in this cultivation world to help him survive.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the reason the beast-luring powder formula worked was because it was easy to compound.</p><p></p><p>As for other formulas he knew from past cultivation games, like pill refining, artifact forging, and so on, he would probably need to deduce and experiment with them first.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Yu was already very satisfied. Compared to others, he at least knew what ingredients were needed and their quantities - all that was left were the order and flame control.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, apart from the formulas, his greater wealth was the other knowledge and quest walkthroughs he possessed.</p><p></p><p>"I need to save up some more money to buy a suitable magic treasure." Thinking about the appearance of the earth rodent beasts implying a possible first-grade spirit vein underground, Su Yu felt a sense of urgency. Even a low-grade magic treasure was worth dozens of lower-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have that much money now, so he could only slowly save up.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

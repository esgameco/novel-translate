        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Thinking of that possibility, Elder Su Chang gritted his teeth, his eyes filled with even more murderous intent: "Guo Chudong, if you really colluded with the Lin family to harm my Su family, I, Su Chang, will definitely kill you!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ruosu, on the other hand, looked around the courtyard, sensing the increasingly close aura of countless earth rock rats, and urgently said: "Stop talking about that, let's deal with this group of earth rock rats first!"</p><p></p><p>The swarm of earth rock rat demons erupted, rushing out from the spiritual veins below. </p><p></p><p>All the cultivators of the Su family in the large courtyard were awakened and their faces changed when they saw this scene.</p><p></p><p>"So many earth rock rats!?"  </p><p></p><p>"Not good, the courtyard's formation is gone!"</p><p></p><p>"Quick, everyone get ready to defend against the swarm of earth rock rat demons!"</p><p></p><p>The two elders, Su Chang and Su Ruosu, shouted angrily, allowing all the cultivators to regain their senses and follow the two elders to guard the four corners of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Su Chang and Su Ruosu had serious expressions as they looked towards three directions.</p><p></p><p>Three late-stage earth rock rat demon beasts at the first level!</p><p></p><p>The aura on one of the earth rock rats could even be compared to the eighth layer of the Qi Refining realm!</p><p></p><p>Su Chang took a deep breath and said in a low voice, "I'll deal with the strongest earth rock rat, you take care of one, and leave the last one."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking.</p><p></p><p>Su Chang and Su Ruosu were suddenly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because behind the swarm of earth rock rats charging towards the courtyard, there was suddenly chaos, and the three late-stage earth rock rats at the front abruptly stopped, turned around, and let out a piercing screech, dispersing the earth rock rats that were charging over madly.</p><p></p><p>Not far behind the three late-stage earth rock rats, Su Yu threw over three portions of spirit rice mixed with even stronger bait powder.</p><p></p><p>Even the enraged and frenzied earth rock rats could not resist the temptation of the bait powder.</p><p></p><p>It was like cats encountering catnip - the three late-stage earth rock rat demon beasts' eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>After driving away the earth rock rats that wanted to devour that spirit rice, the three late-stage earth rock rat demon beasts shot over and swallowed that portion of spirit rice in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>That one mouthful felt like their souls were floating in the air - it was simply the greatest enjoyment in their rat lives.</p><p></p><p>Their souls were drifting in a trance of ecstasy, and the bodies of the three late-stage earth rock rat demon beasts were also swaying unsteadily.</p><p></p><p>Soon after.</p><p></p><p>Bang bang bang.</p><p></p><p>The three late-stage earth rock rat demon beasts fell to the ground, snoring loudly in deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding earth rock rat demons stared with their red bulging eyes, a bit dazed. The earth rock rats' intelligence was not high.</p><p></p><p>They could not be considered true demon tribes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, their intelligence was not enough to comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>Without the three leaders of the demon swarm, they did not know what to do next.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, another eleven portions of spirit rice mixed with bait powder were thrown out. Under Su Yu's precise control of spiritual power, these spirit rice portions landed near the mid-stage earth rock rats of the first level in the demon swarm.</p><p></p><p>"Squeaksqueaksqueak!"</p><p></p><p>One after another, the earth rock rats charged madly to fight over them.</p><p></p><p>Soon after.</p><p></p><p>Nearly half of the few mid-stage earth rock rat demons in the swarm had fallen.</p><p></p><p>By the time the three elders Su Chang and the fourth elder Su Ruosu led people out, the remaining earth rock rat demons were powerless to resist.</p><p></p><p>Most were hunted down, with only a few escaping back into the underground.</p><p></p><p>From the eruption of the earth rock rat demon swarm to nearly the entire swarm being eliminated, the whole process did not even last half an hour.</p><p></p><p>Using spirit artifacts to sever the heads of the three late-stage earth rock rat demon beasts to ensure they were truly dead, Su Chang turned to look at Su Yu, unable to hide his shock as he asked: "How did you take down this group of late and mid-stage earth rock rat demons?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu pondered for a moment and said...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"I saw a recipe in an ancient book specifically for dealing with the rock-burrowing demonic beasts." </p><p></p><p>"After taking this medicine, the rock-burrowers will fall into a coma, allowing anyone to slaughter them."</p><p></p><p>Before Su Chang could speak, Su Yu continued, "Originally, I planned to hunt down all the rock-burrowing demonic beasts in the medicine garden during this period, and then hand over the recipe to the family."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect this kind of incident to occur tonightâ€”"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the rock-burrower corpses around him, Su Yu felt a bit helpless. The rock-burrowers in the medicine garden would be 'extinct' next. </p><p></p><p>The beast-luring powder recipe he had was useless now.</p><p></p><p>He might as well give it to the family right away.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu looked at the Third Elder Su Chang and said, "That recipe is called the Beast-Luring Powder, a tranquilizer specifically for rock-burrowers. I'll hand over this recipe to the family next."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Chang suddenly realized and looked at Su Yu with increasing delight. He had long paid attention to Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>Although Su Yu's spiritual roots and innate talents were not outstanding, his body cultivation seemed quite good.</p><p></p><p>Plus, Su Yu was very skilled at hunting rock-burrowers, so Su Chang rather liked this junior of his.</p><p></p><p>He even thought about focusing efforts to cultivate him.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, there was no way Su Yu could have hunted so many rock-burrowing demonic beasts over the past year and been able to successfully claim the family's bounties.</p><p></p><p>One must know that the low-grade spirit stones offered as bounties for so many rock-burrowers was no small sum.</p><p></p><p>And now, with such a major incident occurring in the medicine garden, he had thought the garden would suffer damage this time. But Su Yu stepped up instead.</p><p></p><p>He easily subdued the three late-stage first-level demonic beasts that were the most difficult to deal with.</p><p></p><p>He even helped them nearly exterminate the hidden threat of the rock-burrower demonic beast pack.</p><p></p><p>How could this not make Su Chang feel surprised and delighted?</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good!" Su Chang said three times, feeling both joyful and relieved. "Rest assured, you have made great contributions this time. The family will not forget. As for the recipe you mentioned, the family will evaluate its value and definitely not let you be shortchanged."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the cultivators from the family processing one rock-burrower demonic beast corpse after another, Su Chang added, "Tonight's harvest, I will carefully tally for you."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's heart stirred, and he said, "Third Granduncle, I want the essence blood from those three late-stage first-level rock-burrower demonic beasts. Is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>A late-stage first-level demonic beast would have around forty to fifty drops of essence blood.</p><p></p><p>Three of them would be over a hundred drops, enough for him to cultivate his body refinement technique for a very long time.</p><p></p><p>He might even be able to break through to the seventh level of the technique.</p><p></p><p>Third Granduncle?</p><p></p><p>Su Chang paused, then laughed heartily, "Third Granduncle is good! Of course that's possible. Those three demonic beasts were subdued by you, so how to handle them is up to you."</p><p></p><p>The Fourth Elder Su Ruosu didn't interact much with Su Yu, but this astonishing scene tonight left a deep impression on her, firmly etching this junior into her memory.</p><p></p><p>Don't look at Su Ruosu's still youthful appearance - that was just the effect of taking a beauty pill. In reality, she was of the same generation as Su Yu's grandmother.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Su Ruosu looked at Su Yu, her eyes revealing a hint of admiration and amazement.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time she knew there was such an interesting junior in the medicine garden.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Ruosu did not forget their current predicament. She softly reminded, "Old Third, we must quickly check if there are any problems with the great formation of the medicine garden."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, if that Guo fellow really did collude with the Lin Family, then our troubles will be far greater, and it will be too early to celebrate."</p><p></p><p>Reminded by Su Ruosu, Su Chang's expression turned ugly again as he gritted his teeth, "Daring to betray the Su Family, he's courting death!"</p><p></p><p>Su Chang hurriedly made arrangements, leaving a small portion of people to clear the demonic beasts and guard the medicine garden.</p><p></p><p>He and Su Ruosu went to inspect the formations, while the remaining people prepared to defend against a potential ambush on the medicine garden by the Lin Family.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

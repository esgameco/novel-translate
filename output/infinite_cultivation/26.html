        <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Su family did not sell the Mind-Muddling Liquid externally because its effect was more potent than the Beast-Luring Powder, so for the time being, it was not suitable to be released. </p><p></p><p>The Su family had the business of Beast-Luring Powder, which brought in considerable profits every year.</p><p></p><p>If the Mind-Muddling Liquid were to appear as well, the Su family might not be able to keep it under control.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>The Mind-Muddling Liquid had already been used for two years in the conflict between the Su family and the Lin family. As long as it was not sold, there was no need to hide it away.</p><p></p><p>As for the favor owed by Chen Sisi, a disciple of the Cloud Sword Sect—</p><p></p><p>Su Yu felt that investing one bottle of Mind-Muddling Liquid was worth it, after all, Chen Sisi cultivated the rare ice-attribute martial arts and spells.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, there was also a young lady from the legitimate branch of the Yu family of Black Rock Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu pondered for a moment, then took out the remaining half-bottle of Mind-Muddling Liquid from his qiankun bag and said, "This is the Mind-Muddling Liquid refined by my master. It is not for sale externally for the time being, so this will be given to Miss Yu."</p><p></p><p>"Although it's only half a bottle, this amount is enough to capture two late-stage first-realm demonic beasts. I only have this half bottle, I apologize."</p><p></p><p>Yu Ke'er frowned slightly and said, "Can't you refine it? Or ask your master to refine another bottle? I have money, I can buy it."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu shook his head and said, "My master is not here, and I am only a first-realm intermediate pill refiner. The Mind-Muddling Liquid capable of subduing late-stage first-realm demonic beasts is of the advanced first-realm level."</p><p></p><p>Yu Ke'er wrinkled her nose, had the old maid behind her take the half-bottle of Mind-Muddling Liquid, and asked, "How much?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu smiled wryly and said, "One hundred low-grade spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Yu Ke'er's eyes widened, and just as she was about to speak, Su Yu continued, "This is a concentrated liquid, best applied to magic treasures for use."</p><p></p><p>"Since you want to capture the other party alive, the Mind-Muddling Liquid is indeed a good choice."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, cheap poisons work quite well."</p><p></p><p>Yu Ke'er looked at Su Yu's young and handsome face and said, "I'll take it, and order another bottle of Mind-Muddling Liquid. Auntie Hai, pay the bill."</p><p></p><p>Leaving three hundred low-grade spirit stones, Yu Ke'er turned and left.</p><p></p><p>When Chen Sisi left, she once again said in a low voice, "Thank you, Brother Su. I owe you a favor. If there's anything, feel free to find me."</p><p></p><p>Then Chen Sisi followed after Yu Ke'er and left.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu collected the spirit stones and shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Yu Ke'er insisted on paying with spirit stones, as she did not want to owe anyone a favor, so he accepted them.</p><p></p><p>As for the price—</p><p></p><p>It was about three times the cost of refining the Mind-Muddling Liquid.</p><p></p><p>So over the past two years, Su Yu's personal wealth had grown increasingly substantial.</p><p></p><p>For a pill refiner with a 100% success rate, making money was truly not difficult.</p><p></p><p>Turning back to the rear courtyard to continue cultivating, after recovering his spiritual power, energy, and mental focus, Su Yu continued refining pills.</p><p></p><p>Currently, nearly half of the first-realm intermediate pills in the Su Family Pill Pavilion were refined by Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>After going out for a while, Su Qingyi returned and said, "It turns out that the Chen family where Chen Sisi belongs is not weak, they even have an elder at the Foundation Establishment realm."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that the Chen family is not doing well these days. A spiritual vein containing the purple gold sand, a commonly used material for refining low and mid-grade magic treasures of great value, appeared in one of their mines."</p><p></p><p>"But shortly after the spiritual vein was discovered, the Chen family was targeted by the Bai family of Maple City, and the Chen family suffered heavy losses at that mine."</p><p></p><p>"That's why the Chen family now wants to seek help from the Yu family. Even if it's just the third branch of the Yu family, it would still make the Bai family of Maple City apprehensive and unwilling to act recklessly."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu frowned slightly, it was the Bai family of Maple City again.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Su Qingyi with doubt and asked, "How do you know all this?"</p><p></p><p>Su Qingyi smiled and said, "Li Shinan is preparing to take leave from the Cloud Sword Sect to return to the secular kingdom and visit his relatives. He invited me to go to the royal palace with him for experience."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"The matter with Chen Sisi is as he said."</p><p></p><p>Hesitating for a moment, Su Qingyi said, "I should apply to leave Danjue and go to Li Shinan's place for a visit."</p><p></p><p>"After that, I'll see if I need to visit Chen Sisi's Chen family. The Bai family of Fengcheng has intervened in Jiangcheng's affairs and is now in conflict with the Chen family. I want to go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Su Qingyi left, and Su Yu saw him off outside the market street, silently watching his departing back for a moment. </p><p></p><p>Perhaps pill refining was indeed not suitable for Su Qingyi, and he could not take the path of slowly cultivating while hiding in the market street.</p><p></p><p>Su Yun returned to Jiangcheng for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Su Yu took charge of the Su family's Pill Pavilion. He tried adding some premium first-grade and mid-grade spirit pills for sale at the Pill Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>At first, not many people knew about it, but as time passed, people in the surrounding market streets all came to know that the Su family's Pill Pavilion could produce small batches of premium spirit pills.</p><p></p><p>The talented pill refiner Su Yu's reputation spread within a small circle.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later.</p><p></p><p>Xu Erzi came to the Pill Pavilion to collect that bottle of Bewildering Spirit Liquid and gave Su Yu a once-over, "I didn't expect that you could actually refine premium first-grade and mid-grade spirit pills."</p><p></p><p>Before Su Yu could respond, Xu Erzi revealed a faint smile, seeming in a good mood, and said with a hint of pride, "But thanks to your Bewildering Spirit Liquid, I've now become a first-grade superior beast tamer."</p><p></p><p>After taking the Bewildering Spirit Liquid, Xu Erzi tossed Su Yu a token and said, "This is for you, a token for the Cloud Mountain Auction House."</p><p></p><p>"The Cloud Mountain Auction that happens once every three years will take place in seven days. You can go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Holding the token and watching Xu Erzi's departing back, Su Yu was a bit puzzled. She gave him an auction house token?</p><p></p><p>He sent his spiritual sense into the token and looked at the auction list inside. His eyes flickered as he saw many items that piqued his interest, most importantly, he saw that there was a Foundation Establishment Pill.</p><p></p><p>As the auction approached, the Cloud Mountain market street did become much livelier, with many unfamiliar cultivators appearing.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu brought the auction token and went to the Cloud Mountain Trading House to participate in the auction with his master, Su Yun.</p><p></p><p>With the auction token, they were able to get a small private room on the second floor.</p><p></p><p>"No matter what, we must obtain one of those Foundation Establishment Pills," Su Yun said in a low voice as soon as they sat down.</p><p></p><p>The auction house was huge, and participating in the auction required at least one hundred low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Downstairs in the main auction hall on the first floor, hundreds of cultivators had gathered.</p><p></p><p>On the second and third floors, in the private rooms, there were even more powerful experts present, including some at the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>The auction soon began.</p><p></p><p>The first item up for auction was a premium first-grade longevity pill, with a starting price of one hundred low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Many elderly Qi Condensation cultivators' eyes lit up. Premium first-grade longevity pills were not common, and if they had never taken a longevity pill before, this one could potentially extend their lifespan by over five years.</p><p></p><p>The bidding for the longevity pill was intense, and it was eventually sold for five hundred and eighty low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>In the private room on the second floor, neither Su Yu nor Su Yun bid, watching as one item after another was auctioned off.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until a first-grade superior talisman inheritance appeared that Su Yu bid, obtaining it for four hundred and sixty low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Nearing the end, the auctioneer brought out an egg about a foot in size, with a dark golden hue and emanating a scorching aura.</p><p></p><p>The auctioneer said, "This is a second-grade bloodline Fire Ape Demonic Beast egg. According to the Xu family of Black Rock Mountain's inspection, this egg was likely taken directly from the womb, resulting in a slight innate deficiency."</p><p></p><p>"However, this does not affect the ferocity of the Fire Ape Demonic Beast. With proper nurturing, it still has the potential to reach the second-grade Demonic Beast level."</p><p></p><p>"The starting price is three hundred low-grade spirit stones. Each bid must increase by at least fifty low-grade spirit stones. Which customer is interested?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

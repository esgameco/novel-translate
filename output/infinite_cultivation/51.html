        <h1>Chapter 51</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until the next day that the Bai family of Fengcheng City discovered the incident. The only remaining Bai family elder at the third level of the Foundation Establishment realm, as well as the Bai family patriarch and others, all appeared. </p><p></p><p>The Bai family patriarch's face was pale as he looked at the charred remains in front of him, tears streaming down his face, his body trembling uncontrollably. </p><p></p><p>The next moment, the Bai family patriarch collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhhh!!!!"</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Huan, who killed my Xiao Huan?!!!"</p><p></p><p>The Bai family patriarch's shrill cries of grief echoed for dozens of miles around.</p><p></p><p>The black-haired Bai family elder standing beside him had a gloomy expression. After the elder completed the investigation and walked over to him, he said in a low voice, "Elder, the person who took action should be a wood-attributed Qi Condensation cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"But this person had a powerful beast tamer or puppet beast. Xiao Huan had clashed with it before but was eventually defeated."</p><p></p><p>"What killed Xiao Huan in the end should have been a second-grade low-tier fire-thunder talisman."</p><p></p><p>Whew!</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Bai family elder took a deep breath and closed his eyes, his anger flaring up. A second-grade low-tier talisman?!</p><p></p><p>Their Bai family had also possessed second-grade low-tier talismans before, but not anymore.</p><p></p><p>And now they were being attacked by someone using a second-grade low-tier talisman.</p><p></p><p>How could he tolerate this?</p><p></p><p>"Blood Blade Luo Bang—damn it." The Bai family elder gritted his teeth in hatred. If it weren't for that damned demonic cult, how could their Bai family have ended up in this state?</p><p></p><p>The Foundation Establishment elder of the Bai family who was killed by the Blood Blade cultivator Luo Bang was their only second-grade low-tier talisman master.</p><p></p><p>Previously, their Bai family had accumulated some second-grade low-tier talismans.</p><p></p><p>But over the years, in order to seize the Chen family's purple-gold sand spirit mine and to counter the previous counterattacks from the Chen and Su families against the Bai family, the Bai family's second-grade low-tier talismans had been completely depleted.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if Bai Yu Huan still had one or two second-grade low-tier talismans on hand, perhaps the outcome would not have been death.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the Bai family elder gritted his teeth and said in a low voice, "Investigate!"</p><p></p><p>"Find the wood-attributed Qi Condensation cultivator who has a second-grade low-tier fire-thunder talisman. I want to know who dared to kill someone from my Bai family!"</p><p></p><p>If it were a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he would grit his teeth and let it go.</p><p></p><p>But a Qi Condensation cultivator—</p><p></p><p>What did it matter if they had a second-grade low-tier talisman?! They provoked the Bai family and killed a ninth-level Qi Condensation cultivator of the Bai family. He dared to kill!</p><p></p><p>Su Yu had been rushing all along and only stopped in a secluded forest when he was near Baiyue Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>It had been nearly a month since his encounter with the second young lady of the Fengcheng Bai family.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the Bai family's remaining third-level Foundation Establishment elder, he dared not linger there for a moment. He traveled day and night, sometimes riding his sword and sometimes summoning the Black Scale Eagle to ride, hurrying to Baiyue Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>That speed was much faster than a spirit horse.</p><p></p><p>"They shouldn't be able to catch up, right?"</p><p></p><p>He found a cave, blocked the entrance with huge rocks, and finally exhaled as he sat cross-legged inside the cave.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the map of the Baiyue Immortal City region, Su Yu thought to himself, "It's not far now. I can get there in half a day tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu thought of the interspatial bags he had obtained from the bodies of the second young lady of the Fengcheng Bai family and others. He took out all the items.</p><p></p><p>Opening the interspatial bag of the second young lady of the Fengcheng Bai family, there was a mess of random things inside that made Su Yu's eyelids twitch. He quickly destroyed it and used his magic to clean the remaining items seven or eight times before stopping.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu cursed inwardly, "Damn, that was really eye-scorching."</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had seen such a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about Lin Dan Lang, he couldn't help but feel nine-tenths sympathy for him.</p><p></p><p>It was hard to imagine what he had gone through.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately.</p><p></p><p>The remaining items in the second young lady's interspatial bag were not bad. There were more than three hundred low-grade spirit stones, a bunch of first-grade medium and high-grade talisman materials.</p><p></p><p>The most eye-catching item was a high-quality medium-grade legal weapon in the shape of a wolf's tooth staff.</p><p></p><p>All the items combined were worth a thousand low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not a loss."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Su Yu took a light breath and put the items into her own spatial bag, while throwing away all the other spatial bags. </p><p></p><p>As for fortuitous encounters—</p><p>There were none.</p><p>This was normal, where would there be so many fortuitous encounters in the world?</p><p></p><p>After recovering her spiritual power in the cave, Su Yu began her daily cultivation - the Qingmu Circular Cultivation Method, the 108 Body Refining Techniques of the Alligator Demon, followed by the Golden Cicada Method.</p><p></p><p>After completing her daily cultivation, Su Yu glanced at the proficiency panel.</p><p></p><p>[Longevity: 42/139.]</p><p>[Cultivation Methods: Qingmu Circular Cultivation Method (7 cycles, proficiency 90.12%), 108 Body Refining Techniques of the Alligator Demon (9th layer, proficiency 82.97%), Blood Whale Devouring Moon Technique (1st realm, proficiency 10%), Golden Cicada Method (1st layer, proficiency 34.54%).]</p><p></p><p>"Another six years have passed."</p><p>Su Yu felt a slight daze in her heart, time really passed quickly. </p><p>It had been six years since she last broke through to the 7th layer of Qi Condensation realm.</p><p></p><p>Coming back to her senses.</p><p>Su Yu looked at the proficiency panel and thought inwardly, "The Qingmu Circular Cultivation Method and the Body Refining Technique will soon be improved again."</p><p></p><p>The Qingmu Circular Cultivation Method she found in the Heavenly Book Pavilion of Yunshan Borough had three cycles with a total of twenty-seven turns.</p><p>This would be enough for her to cultivate to the Pill Condensation realm!</p><p></p><p>As for the 108 Body Refining Techniques of the Alligator Demon, it had the first eighteen techniques, enough for her to cultivate to the 18th layer.</p><p>That should be a realm comparable to the 9th layer of the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Su Yu inwardly looked forward to it. Once the 108 Body Refining Techniques of the Alligator Demon broke through the 10th layer—</p><p>Would that mean it could match the 1st layer of the Foundation Establishment realm?</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if the Immortal City of Baimoon has a Heavenly Book Pavilion? And if it has the follow-up parts of these cultivation methods?"</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, as the sky brightened slightly, </p><p>Su Yu looked at the huge city sprawled across the plain in front of her, the massive defensive grand formation barrier, and took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"Yunshan Borough and this place are really incomparable."</p><p></p><p>Walking to the city gate, which was also the entrance of the Immortal City of Baimoon's defensive grand formation,</p><p>There were members of the Immortal City of Baimoon's cultivator guard keeping watch. To enter, each person had to pay ten low-grade spirit stones.</p><p>And if you didn't buy or rent a house inside, then for each additional day you stayed, you had to pay the Immortal City of Baimoon another low-grade spirit stone.</p><p>Even if you stayed at an inn, it was the same.</p><p></p><p>In the morning, there were more than twenty cultivators queuing to enter and exit at this entrance.</p><p>After Su Yu paid the fee and obtained the city entry token to pass through the defensive grand formation, instead of streets and buildings, there was a vast expanse of spirit fields stretching as far as the eye could see.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the outer city wall of the Immortal City of Baimoon encompassed all of its spirit fields.</p><p></p><p>After entering the defensive grand formation, a concentration of spiritual qi denser than outside enveloped her.</p><p>A vast expanse of spirit fields was shrouded in mist, with a few small mountains faintly visible in the clouds, like a celestial realm.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu felt it for a moment and thought inwardly, "This spiritual qi is already better than a first-grade spiritual vein's blessed land."</p><p></p><p>Following the crowd, she flew on her artifact sword, crossing a large stretch of spirit fields, before finally seeing a cluster of buildings ahead, like an inner city, surrounded by another small city wall.</p><p></p><p>There were no guards here, but everyone stopped at the city gate, retrieving their flying artifacts and walking into the Immortal City of Baimoon.</p><p>Because the Immortal City of Baimoon prohibited anyone other than its own people from flying on artifacts within the inner city.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu knew this rule, so she followed the others, retrieving her flying sword and walking into the city.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering, a lively scene came into view.</p><p>The main street was bustling with people coming and going.</p><p></p><p>Besides cultivators, there were also many ordinary people without spiritual roots. These should be the Immortal City of Baimoon's original residents, or the descendants of cultivators who had bought houses and settled here.</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look around first, then see if I want to buy a house," Su Yu thought to herself as she walked into the crowd for some casual sightseeing.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

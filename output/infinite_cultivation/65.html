        <h1>Chapter 65</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Half a month later.</p><p></p><p>Suxizhi brought news that the family master Suxpeng failed in his attempt to break through to the Foundation Establishment realm, suffering a backlash that severely injured his primordial energy. Instead, it was the Fourth Elder Suxjingbang who successfully broke through to the Foundation Establishment realm. </p><p></p><p>This failed attempt almost extinguished Suxpeng's hope of ever breaking through again in the future.</p><p></p><p>So Suxpeng was still recuperating and recovering his severely depleted primordial energy in that residence in the core area, while Suxjingbang was secluded in cultivation there. As for Suxizhi, she was arranged by Suxpeng to return to the courtyard residence in the hutong to persuade Suxyu to go back and take over as the clan leader.</p><p></p><p>Suxyu said, "Sister, my temperament is not suited to be the clan leader. Moreover, I still need to strive in my cultivation to try to break through to the Foundation Establishment realm as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Suxizhi let out a light sigh, "I knew you wouldn't agree, but Father still mentions you, hoping you would become the successor, especially after that incident with Master Guo. It's just that you went to Cloudridge Town and stayed there for twenty years."</p><p></p><p>"Originally Qingyi could have succeeded you, but..."</p><p></p><p>Suxizhi didn't continue. The two fell silent, recalling the past. After Suxyu stayed in Cloudridge Town, the clan had intended to groom Suxqingyi to succeed Suxyu.</p><p></p><p>But who could have imagined that Suxqingyi would betray the clan and follow the demonic path?</p><p></p><p>If Suxyu didn't want to take over as the family master, they could only discuss further.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Suxyu broke the silence, "It doesn't necessarily have to be a descendant at the Qi Condensation realm to be the family master. Now that Elder Jingbang has broken through to the Foundation Establishment realm, his lifespan will be at least a hundred more years."</p><p></p><p>"Elder Jingbang has the strength and capability to also be the family master."</p><p></p><p>Suxizhi pondered for a while before saying, "We'll see what Father thinks, as well as Elder Jingbang, the Patriarch, the First Elder, and the others."</p><p></p><p>Not long after, there was a message from the Cloud Sword Sect, so Suxizhi had to leave Baimoon Immortal City to return to the sect.</p><p></p><p>After the six-month rental period ended for the residence in the core area, Suxpeng and Suxjingbang returned to the courtyard in the hutong. Suxpeng's primordial energy had clearly not recovered from his failed attempt, his hair completely white, looking even more aged than before.</p><p></p><p>Suxpeng still wanted to persuade Suxyu, but after hearing what he said, he let out a light sigh and looked towards Suxjingbang.</p><p></p><p>Suxjingbang's expression was odd - how did it get brought up to him?</p><p></p><p>He had never thought about becoming the family master.</p><p></p><p>"Family Master, let's discuss it again." Suxjingbang hurriedly cut off what Suxpeng was about to say. It was rare for someone at the Foundation Establishment realm to be the family master because being the master was too laborious.</p><p></p><p>Always busy with clan affairs, when would there be time for cultivation?</p><p></p><p>So for clans at the level of the Su Family, they usually selected descendants at the eighth or ninth level of Qi Condensation to be the family master.</p><p></p><p>Those at the Foundation Establishment realm would become Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Suxpeng and Suxjingbang both left Baimoon Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Things were not peaceful in the clan, so they could not be away for too long.</p><p></p><p>The Huang and Jiang Clans were exerting pressure, more and more demonic cultivators and evil paths were gathering at Eight Fiend Ridge, even the Cloud Sword Sect itself was unstable.</p><p></p><p>This period was bound to be an eventful autumn.</p><p></p><p>Especially Eight Fiend Ridge - it was rumored that the demonic cultivator Blood Saber who stole the incomplete supreme-grade artifact was hiding there.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately,</p><p></p><p>The Su Family had gained another Foundation Establishment cultivator, strengthening them a bit more.</p><p></p><p>Their foundation was also gradually accumulating.</p><p></p><p>"The clan..." Watching the family master and Fourth Elder's departing figures, Suxyu remained silent for a long time. He still held firm to his choice.</p><p></p><p>From the very beginning, he had never thought about staying in the Su Family.</p><p></p><p>Going to the Medicine Garden was his first step in leaving the clan to cultivate. Then it was Cloudridge Town, and now he had come to the even more distant Baimoon Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>How could he possibly retrace his steps and go back to take over the clan?</p><p></p><p>In his view, compared to the entire cultivation world, the Su Family was too small.</p><p></p><p>Baimoon Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>A few streets away from the hutong, at the edge of the market district.</p><p></p><p>A single-story wooden building with a rear courtyard that used to be a shop had been renovated into the "Wutong Pill Pavilion", which had been open for business for over three months.</p><p></p><p>In just those three months, the Wutong Pill Pavilion's pill quality and reputation had spread in the surrounding area, gradually gaining quite a few regular customers with a steady stream of patrons.</p><p></p><p>In the rear courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Deep into the night after the pavilion closed, Suxyu did not return to the courtyard residence in the hutong.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The stars in the sky shone brilliantly, and strands of silvery moonlight spilled onto the rear courtyard of the Dange building, also draping a layer of gauze over the cross-legged and meditating Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's expression was focused as he continuously channeled the power of the Qingmu Suixun technique into the flat bean-like seed in his palm, causing a faint green glow to blossom from within the seed. </p><p></p><p>It had been more than a decade since the last time the seed accidentally fell and grew, enhancing his strength.</p><p></p><p>After over ten years of nourishing it with his powers, the life force within this seed had recently reached a new peak, filling Su Yu with great anticipation.</p><p></p><p>What phenomena or opportunities would the seed bring this time?</p><p></p><p>Finally, in the latter half of the night, a verdant glow radiated from the seed before it fell from Su Yu's hand and began growing.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye,</p><p>The seed sprouted roots, accompanied by an increasingly brilliant emerald radiance.</p><p></p><p>In less than ten breaths, a tree nearly two zhang tall appeared before Su Yu, its body curved like a coiled dragon with densely packed dragon-scale-like "armor" and vigorous branches like an undulating celestial serpent.</p><p></p><p>The starlight in the sky converged, and the spiritual energy of heaven and earth from all directions of Baiyue Immortal City also flowed towards the spiritual plant, gradually forming a surge.</p><p></p><p>A flower bud appeared at the end of a branch, gradually enlarging and emanating a dazzling white light.</p><p></p><p>This time, instead of a rich fragrance, the blossoming flower produced a verdant green fruit.</p><p></p><p>The fruit grew to the size of a bodhi seed before turning a translucent golden hue.</p><p>At this point, an extraordinarily rich and exotic fragrance wafted out.</p><p></p><p>"Rustle rustle rustle."</p><p></p><p>In the night breeze, the branches and leaves of the spiritual plant rustled, the sound indicating a real tree rather than an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu watched this entire phenomenon unfold with utter astonishment. Just what was this seed?</p><p></p><p>From sprouting to bearing ripe fruit, it took less than half an hour.</p><p></p><p>After observing the spiritual plant for a moment, Su Yu reached out and plucked the single golden fruit. As soon as it left the tree, the nearly two-zhang tall spiritual plant instantly turned to ash and dispersed.</p><p></p><p>"Thisâ€”" Su Yu's gaze slightly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>He had not discovered the seed, so his eyes fell on the golden fruit emitting a rich exotic fragrance in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Based on the previous pollen and fragrance, this fruit should be non-toxic.</p><p></p><p>So after a moment's thought, Su Yu put the fruit in his mouth and bit into it.</p><p></p><p>The golden peel broke with one bite, revealing not pulp inside but a liquid brimming with fragrance.</p><p></p><p>The liquid flowed into his mouth and down his throat into his stomach.</p><p></p><p>The golden peel visibly shriveled, leaving only a flat seed.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The next instant, a wave of searing energy swept through his body.</p><p></p><p>Yet his spiritual soul felt an opposing cooling sensation, as a refreshing force merged into his consciousness. The Golden Cicada technique automatically activated to refine it, and he could feel his spiritual power rapidly expanding at a visible rate.</p><p></p><p>Simultaneously, the wood and earth attributes of the Qingmu Suixun and Xuanming Hoututu techniques within his dantian rapidly amplified.</p><p></p><p>Time passed slowly.</p><p></p><p>When the night ended and a golden ray of dawn spilled into the rear courtyard, Su Yu opened his eyes, his pupils radiating an aura surpassing the Condensing Qi realm.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, he felt his spiritual awareness was extraordinarily lucid, his thoughts seemingly faster than before.</p><p></p><p>His perception through sight, vision, hearing and other senses had undergone a qualitative transformation.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu silently sensed the changes within himself, his pupils slightly contracting in shock: "The Golden Cicada technique has advanced to the second layer. Though my spiritual awareness has not broken through to the Foundation Establishment realm, it has already transformed to that level."</p><p></p><p>"As for my powers, the Qingmu Suixun technique progressed by the equivalent of ten years in one night, reaching the ninth layer of the Condensing Qi realm."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanming Hoututu has also reached the sixth layer."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

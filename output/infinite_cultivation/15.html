        <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>On the proficiency panel, a line of words silently appeared.</p><p></p><p>[Technique: Qingmu Suixuan Gong (One Cycle One Rotation, Proficiency 0.01%).]</p><p></p><p>When Su Yu converted all the power from his original Wutong Qingmu Jue into the power of the Qingmu Suixuan Gong, this line of words changed again. </p><p></p><p>[Technique: Qingmu Suixuan Gong (One Cycle Three Rotations, Proficiency 4.4%).]</p><p></p><p>The words "Wutong Qingmu Jue" had completely disappeared from the technique, leaving only Qingmu Suixuan Gong.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu was permeated with an indescribable aura of ancient times. At the same time, he gained new insights into the so-called "one cycle one rotation" of the Qingmu Suixuan Gong.</p><p></p><p>It was like the annual rings of a tree; cultivating the Qingmu Suixuan Gong was engraving the annual rings of time on one's own body.</p><p></p><p>One cycle was one century, one century was one reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>And each rotation was equivalent to shedding a skin.</p><p></p><p>One rotation, one step.</p><p></p><p>One cycle three rotations was the third level of Qi Refining Realm cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The original power of the Qingmu Suixuan Gong was not strong, but as each rotation or even each cycle increased, the power would undergo a metamorphosis and become stronger.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Qingmu Suixuan Gong had a greater effect on longevity than the Wutong Qingmu Jue.</p><p></p><p>At the same third level of Qi Refining Realm, with the Wutong Qingmu Jue, he only had a 100-year lifespan.</p><p></p><p>But now—</p><p></p><p>Su Yu glanced at the proficiency panel.</p><p></p><p>[Lifespan: 18/104.]</p><p></p><p>Just by switching to cultivating the Qingmu Suixuan Gong, his lifespan had increased by four years.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating to the ninth level of the Qi Refining Realm will likely increase my lifespan by at least thirty to forty years, and the longevity effect of the second cycle will undoubtedly be even stronger, probably seventy or eighty years," Su Yu took a slight breath. This Qingmu Suixuan Gong was truly powerful.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention anything else, just this longevity effect alone would make countless cultivators green with envy.</p><p></p><p>Having a lifespan several times longer than other cultivators meant his chances of becoming an immortal or venerable were much greater.</p><p></p><p>Carefully sensing the faint aura of ancient times on his body, Su Yu frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>He felt that this aura was not simple.</p><p></p><p>At least, it was not just as simple as increasing longevity.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this aura was still too weak at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Having successfully converted to the Qingmu Suixuan Gong, Su Yu was in a great mood. This single technique alone made his personal trip to Yunshan Fang Market worthwhile.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I'll try cultivating the 'Blood Whale Swallowing the Moon Technique'," Su Yu thought inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty of cultivating the Qingmu Suixuan Gong was somewhat greater than the Wutong Qingmu Jue, but Su Yu found that the aura of ancient times on his body could gather the spiritual energy of plants and trees from heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the speed of cultivating the Qingmu Suixuan Gong was not slower than the Wutong Qingmu Jue.</p><p></p><p>In about two years, breaking through to the fourth level of the Qi Refining Realm would not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Su Yu was also cultivating the "Crocodile Demon's 108 Body Refining Techniques". With the help of the power of late-stage first-rank demonic beast blood essence, his progress in body refining was advancing by leaps and bounds.</p><p></p><p>Not even two months after Su Yu's return, having consumed more than half of the late-stage first-rank demonic beast blood essence, Su Yu's body refining technique finally broke through to the fifth level.</p><p></p><p>And not long after the body refining technique broke through to the fifth level, the long-stagnant "Blood Whale Swallowing the Moon Technique" suddenly entered the first stage overnight.</p><p></p><p>[Technique: Crocodile Demon's 108 Body Refining Techniques (Fifth Level, Proficiency 0.28%), Blood Whale Swallowing the Moon Technique (First Boundary, Proficiency 0.01%).]</p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>In the deep night, with only a sliver of starlight shining through the window into the room.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, dazzling blood light emanated from Su Yu's body. All the blood energy in his body converged in his heart with a thunderous boom, like deafening thunder rumbling in his mind.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Su Yu felt a slight daze in his spirit.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, the boundless blood energy in his heart converged, and a drop of golden-yellow blood essence condensed out.</p><p></p><p>This drop of golden-yellow blood essence was like a crystalline nucleus, exuding an ominous aura, like an ultimate demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>"Boom! Boom! Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The moment this blood essence formed, Su Yu's heartbeat sounded like thunderous war drums. His heart seemed to have undergone a metamorphosis, with his pulse slowing down considerably, but each surge of blood became more powerful.</p><p></p><p>As time passed slowly...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>When the rising sun cast its golden rays upon Su Yu, he opened his eyes, a tinge of blood flashing through them. </p><p></p><p>At that moment, an aura akin to that of a demonic overlord emanated from his body.</p><p></p><p>However, this aura was fleeting.</p><p></p><p>Awakening from his cultivation, Su Yu carefully examined his current body, his expression somewhat dazed. </p><p></p><p>The changes were significant.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the metamorphosis of his heart, his entire blood had also changed color slightly.</p><p></p><p>It was not the same golden hue as the droplet resembling a crystalline core in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But after a night of transformation, his blood had turned a 'dark golden' shade.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after his fleshly body underwent this metamorphosis, the power of his body refining techniques seemed to have received some empowerment.</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the pure Crocodile Demon's One Hundred and Eight Body Refining Techniques, the strength of my fleshly body has increased by at least thirty percent," Su Yu sensed carefully.</p><p></p><p>However—</p><p></p><p>"Gurgle! Gurgle!"</p><p></p><p>He was so hungry!</p><p></p><p>Su Yu felt like every cell in his body was crying out, feeling extremely depleted, as if the previous night's condensation of the pseudo-divine ability Blood Devouring Moon had drained his body of all its strength.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing this sense of hunger, Su Yu immediately took out some jerky made from rock rat demonic beasts and spirit rice that he had prepared earlier and began cooking.</p><p></p><p>This meal, he ate a full thirty pounds of low-grade spirit rice and nearly fifty pounds of demonic beast jerky before he was satiated.</p><p></p><p>Mouthful after mouthful of spirit rice and jerky went down.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, a warm current flowed through his entire body, with all his cells frantically competing for nourishment.</p><p></p><p>Satisfying.</p><p></p><p>"My appetite has increased significantly, and I can digest these foods much more easily now," Su Yu noticed the changes in his body.</p><p></p><p>After eating so much, his body instantly digested it all.</p><p></p><p>He didn't feel bloated at all.</p><p></p><p>And after digesting this food, Su Yu sensed that most of the energy was being devoured by the core of the Blood Devouring Moon ability in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"To fully accumulate and perfect it will probably take at least half a year," Su Yu thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The first realm of the Blood Devouring Moon ability, if the core power accumulates to perfection, can double the strength of his fleshly body when the pseudo-divine ability erupts.</p><p></p><p>This was a trump card.</p><p></p><p>At a critical juncture, it could not only save his life but also kill his enemies!</p><p></p><p>With his increased appetite, the group of rock rat demonic beasts under his medicine garden became like pots of delicacies in Su Yu's eyes, and he increased the frequency of his hunting.</p><p></p><p>While eating meat, he could also accumulate some spirit stones for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Strangely, in the time that followed, the Lin family seemed to have calmed down considerably, and their friction with the Su family gradually decreased. It was unclear what the Lin family was thinking.</p><p></p><p>Half a year later.</p><p></p><p>The Su family finally invited a first-grade geomancer, spending a great sum to have him search for the dragon's vein and locate the root of the spiritual vein, in order to construct a blessed land for the Su family.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, a geomancer was a type of formation master.</p><p></p><p>But compared to ordinary formation masters, geomancers were more prestigious and mysterious.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary members of the Su family might not understand what a geomancer was, but Su Yu, who had played cultivation games and practiced the geomancer sub-profession in his previous life, understood it very well.</p><p></p><p>Geomancers, in the game, every time they searched for the dragon's vein and located the spiritual grounds, it would cost them a portion of their lifespan.</p><p></p><p>The game introduced geomancers as favored children of Heaven and Earth, able to search the nine heavens above and locate the heavenly dragons below, with unparalleled abilities.</p><p></p><p>Geomancers were the sub-profession most likely to obtain treasures; finding spiritual veins was not difficult for them at all.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it depended on their true skills.</p><p></p><p>However, there were gains and losses – the heaven-defying abilities of geomancers came at the cost of their lifespan.</p><p></p><p>Unless a geomancer could resist the temptation of treasures and refrain from using their secret arts to search for the dragon's vein, every time they used their secret arts, their lifespan would be shortened.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it was not easy to request the services of a geomancer. Even for an entry-level first-grade geomancer, the Su family had to spend a great sum this time.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 35</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"No one came after us." The three of them lay low for a moment, and after confirming there was truly no danger, Су Юнь finally let out a slight sigh of relief. He patted Су Юй's tense arm, telling him to relax a bit and not be so afraid of dying. </p><p></p><p>Су Чжи handed their qiankun bags and the magic formation flag to Су Юнь to check.</p><p></p><p>After checking, Су Юнь's brows furrowed slightly as he took out a black token from inside with nine purple hellfire patterns on it. </p><p></p><p>Су Юнь asked doubtfully, "What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Су Чжи's expression changed slightly when she saw the token. She quickly took it and examined it carefully, saying, "An inner disciple identity token of the Nine Souls Demon Palace...it seems to be. I've seen records of it in the sect, but that can't be possible. That demonic force is not under our Great Moon Manor's control."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, that ghostly golden eagle doesn't have the qualifications. It's a demonic force as powerful as, or even stronger than, the Great Moon Palace."</p><p></p><p>Су Юнь's expression changed as he thought of the tattered demonic formation flag.</p><p></p><p>However, he soon shook his head, "The ghostly golden eagle can't be related to this force. The cultivation method he practices is not a demonic technique."</p><p></p><p>He searched the ghostly golden eagle's qiankun bag and found a beast skin map.</p><p></p><p>A very ordinary map.</p><p></p><p>"This seems to be a map of the Eight Fiend Ridge?" Су Юнь was a bit uncertain. The Eight Fiend Ridge was not far from here, only a day's journey away.</p><p></p><p>It was a place where demonic beasts gathered, and it was even rumored that there were demon tribes inside.</p><p></p><p>The name Eight Fiend Ridge was related to the demon tribes.</p><p></p><p>And Су Юнь keenly detected a faint trace of demonic qi lingering on this map of the Eight Fiend Ridge.</p><p></p><p>Су Юй was unfamiliar with the Eight Fiend Ridge, so he could only watch from the side.</p><p></p><p>However, Су Чжи was familiar with it as she had been there to complete a sect mission before. After taking a look, she nodded in confirmation, "It is indeed a map of the Eight Fiend Ridge."</p><p></p><p>Су Юнь's pupils contracted slightly as he lowered his voice, "Then the ghostly golden eagle's demonic token and that formation flag are likely related to the Eight Fiend Ridge."</p><p></p><p>They didn't find any more clues or items, and there were no marked locations on the map either.</p><p></p><p>So after looking at the map, Су Юнь put the token away again and set it aside for now to first finish checking the other items.</p><p></p><p>"Three hundred and seventy-eight low-grade spirit stones, four mid-grade magic treasures, three low-grade magic treasures, a set of top-grade first-level trapping formation flags, and a damaged second-level low-grade demonic formation flag."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, there are even five ancient jade boxes? Two have been opened, and three remain unopened."</p><p></p><p>Су Чжи carefully calculated. Mid-grade treasures were worth one to two hundred low-grade spirit stones each, low-grade ones seventy to eighty each. A top-grade first-level formation flag set was worth three to four hundred. Even as a demonic magic treasure, the value of that damaged second-level demonic formation flag shouldn't be lower than the trapping formation.</p><p></p><p>So the total gain should be around thirteen to fourteen hundred low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not a loss at least," Су Чжи let out a relieved breath.</p><p></p><p>She had been quite scared earlier.</p><p></p><p>She had already felt that the five top-grade first-level talisman papers she prepared were a lot.</p><p></p><p>But then the Second Elder expended twelve at once!</p><p></p><p>Even her junior martial brother whose cultivation was lower than hers used seven extremely powerful top-grade first-level talisman papers!</p><p></p><p>These two really didn't treat top-grade first-level talismans as anything significant.</p><p></p><p>What if they had run away?</p><p></p><p>That would have been a huge loss.</p><p></p><p>Even our Yunmen Sect wouldn't be so wasteful - it's too expensive.</p><p></p><p>And that was just to deal with one ninth level Qi Condensation cultivator and two eighth level Qi Condensation cultivators.</p><p></p><p>On our side, we also had one ninth level and one eighth level Qi Condensation cultivator. In reality, even if we fought, it's not certain we would lose.</p><p></p><p>Even if we did lose, they could probably still break the formation and retreat without much issue.</p><p></p><p>Су Юй saw Су Чжи's reaction and smiled slightly, "Sister, we didn't lose out..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Actually, it doesn't matter that we lost money. What's important is that we survived, while Ghost Head Golden Eagle and the other two died, all because of those talisman papers."</p><p></p><p>"To kill a chicken, one needs twelve butcher knives, and then burn it to ashes. Staying alive is the most important thing."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Second Elder nodding in deep agreement, Su Zhi was speechless: "......"</p><p></p><p>These master and apprentice, both top-grade ninth-level pill refiners, really did talk big while standing tall.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the support of her family, she couldn't even afford those five top-grade ninth-level talisman papers, let alone what ordinary cultivators could manage.</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh."</p><p></p><p>Su Yun laughed and gave all those more than three hundred low-grade spirit stones to Su Zhi, then pointed to those magical items and said, "Little Zhi, take a look and see if any of these are useful? If useful, pick some. If not, I'll take them back to the family for the Chief Elder."</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi looked and shook her head, "The magical items I have are enough."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu also had no need for those items, but he took an interest in the three unopened ancient jade boxes, pointing to them and saying, "Master, Sister, shall we open them?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yun smiled and tossed the three unopened ancient jade boxes to Su Yu. </p><p></p><p>In Su Yun's view, these ancient jade boxes were no different from toys - most were empty. It was just greed and thrill that made some people obsessed with ancient jade boxes, seeking the so-called ancient opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu also didn't take these few ancient jade boxes seriously. With a wave of his spiritual power, he broke through the residual sealing aura, opening all three ancient jade boxes.</p><p></p><p>One was empty. </p><p></p><p>One contained some clothes, but they turned to flying ashes the moment it was opened.</p><p></p><p>The last one, however, contained a jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"Eh!?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu, Su Yun, and Su Zhi exclaimed in surprise. Su Yu was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>There was actually something inside?</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi exclaimed excitedly, "Little Yu, quickly see what this is."</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Su Yu replied and picked up the jade slip. Under the anticipating gazes of Su Yun and Su Zhi, he probed it with his spiritual sense, and instantly a surge of inherited knowledge poured in.</p><p></p><p>[Forging Method of the Golden Jade Celestial Puppets]</p><p></p><p>It was a top-grade ninth-level puppeteer inheritance, containing methods for creating various puppet beasts.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>The immense inherited knowledge flooded into Su Yu's mind, and the jade slip in his hand shattered and slipped from his grasp onto the ground. Half an hour later, he finally opened his eyes again.</p><p></p><p>Su Yun quickly asked, "How is it?"</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Su Yu said, "It's a top-grade ninth-level puppeteer inheritance."</p><p></p><p>"Puppeteer..."</p><p></p><p>Su Yun looked disappointed. Why couldn't it be an inheritance for pill refining or talisman crafting? No one in the Su family understood puppetry.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, we'll see if anyone wants to study puppetry in the future, it won't go to waste." Su Yun said, "But don't spread the news of this inheritance. A top-grade ninth-level inheritance could tempt some people to have ill intentions."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu and Su Zhi nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, back to the family."</p><p></p><p>The three set off again. Without spirit horses, it took them five days to return to Jiangcheng Cangshan where the Su family was located.</p><p></p><p>The Su family had relocated to the spiritual vein blessed land inside Cangshan Mountain. It had been years since Su Yu last came back, and this time he saw the great changes the Su family had undergone over the years, with courtyards built in an orderly fashion along the spiritual vein.</p><p></p><p>Su Qing Yi's wedding with Chen Si Si was approaching, and the Su family manor was decorated very festively.</p><p></p><p>After returning, Su Yu pondered what gift he should give the couple to celebrate their marriage.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

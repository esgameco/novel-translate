        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>In the early morning, the sky was faintly brightening. </p><p></p><p>Su Yu woke up from his meditation, feeling his state remained at its peak. He slightly nodded, with the three magical treasures in his dantian being nourished by spiritual power. With a thought, he summoned the mid-grade magical treasure, the Green Xuanqi Robe, and put it on under his clothes.</p><p></p><p>As Su Yu was about to inform his master Su Yun, he saw Su Yun walking over holding a jade bottle.</p><p></p><p>Su Yun handed the jade bottle to Su Yu, saying: "This is for you, the Mind-Muddling Liquid."</p><p></p><p>"I tried refining a new potion based on the formula for the Beast-Luring Powder. It doesn't have the luring effect, but it has a potent mind-muddling effect instead."  </p><p></p><p>"A peak late-stage Zuo Shanxiao is no pushover, but if it's affected by enough Mind-Muddling Liquid, it won't last long."</p><p></p><p>Su Yun lowered his voice: "Xiaozhi only needs to hunt a Zuo Shanxiao to pass the inner sect test. This task isn't too difficult. I've tested the effects of this Mind-Muddling Liquid, it works well. Otherwise, I would have prepared some poison for you."</p><p></p><p>"We are alchemists. If we can solve problems with medicine, then it's not really a problem."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu was stunned for a moment. </p><p></p><p>Mind-Muddling Liquid or poison...</p><p></p><p>Then Su Yu's eyes lit up. This was indeed a great thing.</p><p></p><p>It followed the same principle as when he used the Beast-Luring Powder to hunt the Rock Rats.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master." Su Yu quickly accepted the jade bottle. Su Yun explained the usage and duration of the Mind-Muddling Liquid.</p><p></p><p>The liquid could be applied on magical treasures and would last for about half an incense stick's time.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu whispered: "Master, does this Mind-Muddling Liquid work on humans too?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yun paused, then looked at Su Yu meaningfully and said: "I've tested it myself. It works."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu: "..."</p><p></p><p>Tested it himself - what a ruthless man!</p><p></p><p>Originally, Su Yu wanted to ask Su Yun for insights on using poisons and request some protection items. But there was no more time.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I'll go now."</p><p></p><p>After bidding farewell to Su Yun, Su Yu met up with Su Qingyi and they left Yunshan Town, heading towards the Cloud Sword Sect's mountain gate.</p><p></p><p>As they walked, Su Qingyi said in a low voice: "If we encounter any real danger, you can stay close to me. I can't guarantee I can help the young lady hunt the Zuo Shanxiao, but I should be able to protect our lives."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu looked at Su Qingyi in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Su Qingyi's expression was natural as he said softly: "If the young lady can develop in the inner sect of Cloud Sword Sect, it will greatly benefit our Su family."</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention other things, even the Foundation Establishment Pills and their ingredients, which are monopolized by major cultivating forces, would become accessible to our ordinary cultivating families."</p><p></p><p>"For our Su family to truly establish ourselves in Jiangcheng City and deal with the Lin family, we need a Foundation Establishment Elder."</p><p></p><p>Of course, there was one more thing Su Qingyi didn't say:</p><p></p><p>This would also pave the way for him or others in their family to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm in the future.</p><p></p><p>"I understand," said Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>The Foundation Establishment Realm was the biggest bottleneck that obstructed ninety percent of Qi Cultivators from progressing further. The major cultivating forces like Cloud Sword Sect only needed to monopolize the Foundation Establishment Pills and their ingredients to control all the subordinate forces and scattered cultivators under them.</p><p></p><p>The Su family was currently scheming to obtain Foundation Establishment Pills, but sometimes even with spirit stones, they couldn't buy the pills or gather all the ingredients needed to refine them.</p><p></p><p>At Su Yu's current cultivation speed, he would need at least twenty to thirty more years before considering breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't too worried about this bottleneck himself.</p><p></p><p>But others couldn't wait that long...</p><p></p><p>To be honest, the elders of his family had treated him well. He couldn't just abandon them and be a selfish loner.</p><p></p><p>If he was an outsider, it would be easier said than done.</p><p></p><p>But he was part of the Su family, he was Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't abandon everything just to focus solely on his own cultivation right now.</p><p></p><p>When they arrived outside the Cloud Sword Sect's mountain gate, Su Zhi, Li Shinan, and Chen Sisi soon came out. The group of five, led by Su Zhi, headed quickly towards the Zuo Shanxiao's dwelling place.</p><p></p><p>Not long after they entered a desolate ridge, a figure appeared stealthily, glaring coldly in the direction the five had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Su Zhi, Su Yu, Su Qingyi - I'll get rid of three little brats from the Su family at once. Let's see how arrogant you can be then, Su Peng!" The person gritted their teeth and muttered.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a while, this person finally followed them from a distance.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later.</p><p></p><p>At the foot of a towering mountain reaching into the clouds, Su Yu and the others had waited for over an hour when finally...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>They saw the mountain hawk that had gone out hunting fly back to its old nest on the mountain. </p><p></p><p>As Su Zhi was about to speak, Su Yu took out a jade bottle and said in a low voice, "This is a mind-muddling potion, prepared by our master. It has a mind-muddling effect, even on late-stage demonic beasts of the first rank."</p><p></p><p>"Let's first apply the mind-muddling potion to our magic treasures. Then we'll each find an opportunity to attack the mountain hawk, and try our best to subdue it with the mind-muddling potion."</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi, Li Shinan, Chen Sisi, and Su Qingyi all looked at Su Yu with surprise.</p><p></p><p>Mind-muddling potionâ€”</p><p></p><p>This?</p><p></p><p>Seeing the astonished looks on their faces, Su Yu blinked and said softly, "As a pill concocter, isn't it normal for me to use some medicine?"</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi pursed her lips, almost bursting into laughter.</p><p></p><p>Li Shinan smiled and nodded deeply in agreement, saying, "That makes sense."</p><p></p><p>Chen Sisi covered her mouth and looked at Su Yu, finding it quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Su Qingyi took the jade bottle and prepared to apply the potion, muttering softly, "Why didn't I think of using medicine? How stupid of me."</p><p></p><p>Su Qingyi's magic treasure was a golden seal, of unknown rank, with a somewhat strange aura.</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi's magic treasure was a pale blue flying sword, a mid-grade magic treasure judging from its aura.</p><p></p><p>Li Shinan and Chen Sisi each had two low-grade magic treasures.</p><p></p><p>After they had applied the mind-muddling potion, Su Yu coated her Scarlet Blade and Ice Spirit Needles, then hid them in her sleeves.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Su Zhi said in a low voice, "You all try your best to restrain and trap the mountain hawk. I'll take it down. Don't be careless. While preventing the mountain hawk from escaping, be careful of its counterattacks."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu and the others nodded lightly.</p><p></p><p>Then, with Su Zhi leading, the five of them suppressed their auras and stealthily approached the mountain hawk's nest.</p><p></p><p>When they neared the summit and saw the huge nest in the crown of a tree dozens of zhang tall, Su Yu and the others' expressions turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>From afar it didn't seem that big, but up close, this mountain hawk's nest was truly massive, twice the size of an ordinary town house.</p><p></p><p>As they approached within ten zhang of the great tree, with a slight nod from Su Zhi, Su Yu, Su Qingyi, Li Shinan, and Chen Sisi simultaneously acted to trap the mountain hawk in its nest.</p><p></p><p>Wood Binding Art!</p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>Su Yu made her move. In an instant, the branches and vines around the hawk's nest glowed green, as if transforming into countless wooden tendrils that instantly enveloped the entire nest, turning it into a wooden cage.</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, Chen Sisi even knew a rare ice attribute spell. As the cold mist spread, everything above seemed to freeze over.</p><p></p><p>Su Qingyi used a common wood binding spell, but with the light emanating from the golden seal magic treasure on his body, those wooden tendrils shone with a metallic luster, extending through the gaps in Su Yu's wooden cage to directly bind the mountain hawk.</p><p></p><p>Li Shinan was enveloped in an aura of earth elemental force. His gaze fixed on the nest in the tree crown above, he let out a low shout: "Solidify!"</p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the entire nest turned into a massive stone.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to the effect of Chen Sisi's ice spell, the mountain hawk reacted half a beat too slow. In the moment Su Yu and the others trapped its nest and pulled it down from the tree, it let out an enraged, ferocious screech: "Screee!!!"</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The cage formed by Su Yu and the others was instantly shredded to pieces by the mountain hawk's claws.</p><p></p><p>But just as the mountain hawk tried to charge out, Su Zhi threw two first-rank superior ice talismans, while Su Yu threw two first-rank superior Cloud-Piercing Arrow talismans.</p><p></p><p>The ice talismans had freezing effects that could make the enemy's body go numb and greatly reduce their reaction speed.</p><p></p><p>First-rank superior ice talismans had a significant effect on late-stage demonic beasts of the first rank, let alone the two Su Zhi used at once.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>As the ice talismans exploded, the mountain hawk's body was instantly covered in a layer of frost, its movements stalling.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that the two Cloud-Piercing Arrow talismans struck. Burning in mid-air, they transformed into two piercing arrows that flashed by, penetrating the mountain hawk's wings and blasting two huge bloody holes in its body.</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi was stunned, not expecting her tribal junior Su Yu to actually use two first-rank superior Cloud-Piercing Arrow talismans.</p><p></p><p>But she didn't hesitate. The moment the mountain hawk was injured and frozen, her mid-grade flying sword flashed a cold light through the air, instantly piercing into its body through one of the bloody holes.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Su Qingyi's seal, Su Yu's five Ice Spirit Needles, and the magic treasures of Li Shinan and Chen Sisi all pierced into the mountain hawk's wounds.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

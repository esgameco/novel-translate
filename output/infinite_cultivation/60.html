        <h1>Chapter 60</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The deaths of Wu Yigong and the others did not cause any ripples, and even the other neighbors in the hutong did not notice anything amiss. </p><p></p><p>Su Yu's daily life remained the same, practicing the Qingmu Suixun Gong, Emoduo's 108 Body Refining Techniques, and the Golden Cicada Method every day.</p><p></p><p>As for the unique Blood Whale Devouring the Moon technique, not long after breaking through the tenth level of body refining, it quietly advanced to the second realm. </p><p></p><p>Now Su Yu consumed demonic beast essence blood, roasted demonic beast meat, and ate spirit rice every day, accumulating the power of the second realm's core.</p><p></p><p>The second realm of the Blood Whale Devouring the Moon technique could additionally unleash twice the physical strength.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the power unleashed by the first realm was 1*2.  </p><p>While the second realm was 1*3.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu did not know with his current physical strength, how long he could sustain the state of unleashing three times the power before reaching the limit.</p><p>Or rather, whether he could withstand the state of unleashing three times the power.</p><p></p><p>At the Foundation Establishment realm, even the slightest difference in power would be enormous.  </p><p>A one percent difference in power would be enough to crush the opponent.</p><p></p><p>Unleashing three times the powerâ€”</p><p>As long as he could sustain it, even for just a short moment, it would be enough for indiscriminate slaughter.</p><p></p><p>That's why the Blood Whale Demonic Tribe was able to become one of the ancient sea rulers, with their bloodline being the main reason.</p><p>And the reason for their later extinction was definitely also related to this bloodline technique.  </p><p>The Blood Whale Devouring the Moon technique was perhaps just a trigger.</p><p>It was indeed worthy of being called a pseudo-divine technique.</p><p></p><p>"It will probably take about eight years to reach the ninth cycle of the Qingmu Suixun Gong, while the Emoduo's 108 Body Refining Techniques may require ten years to reach the eleventh level."</p><p></p><p>"Progress on the Golden Cicada Method is getting slower and slower, with the second level still a long way off."  </p><p></p><p>"I still don't know if I can withstand the unleashing of the second realm of the Blood Whale Devouring the Moon technique. For now, it's the limit."</p><p></p><p>"So..."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu pondered, with some hesitation: "Apart from pill refining, talisman drawing, and puppet beast creation as side occupations, should I practice another side occupation?"</p><p></p><p>"Or cultivate another elemental technique?"</p><p></p><p>He possessed the five elemental spiritual roots, although they were all lower-grade spiritual roots, very balanced.</p><p>But this also meant that he could cultivate techniques of all five elemental attributes.  </p><p></p><p>So far, he had only cultivated the wood-attribute Qingmu Suixun Gong, leaving the other four elemental spiritual roots idle.</p><p></p><p>If he were an ordinary cultivator, Su Yu definitely wouldn't dare cultivate techniques of all five elements, only specializing in one.</p><p>But with the proficiency panel, his daily cultivation was very easy, just following the routine step-by-step.</p><p></p><p>Now, he only needed to practice the Qingmu Suixun Gong for a little over an hour each day to reach the limit.  </p><p>The remaining time allocated to body refining techniques, the Golden Cicada Method, and even the three side occupations of pill refining, talisman drawing, and puppet beasts didn't require half a day.</p><p></p><p>That still left half a day.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he hadn't considered cultivating techniques of other elemental spiritual roots due to lack of time, resources, and so on.  </p><p>But now, as the Qingmu Suixun Gong and other techniques required more and more time to improve, if he wanted to further increase his strength, he should consider techniques of other elemental spiritual roots or other side occupations.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, the power of dual-attribute spells was stronger than single-attribute ones.  </p><p>Like his grandfather Su Bin, who cultivated the dual wood-earth elemental spiritual roots.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait and see, and see if there are any good side occupation legacies or ancient techniques." Su Yu suppressed the various thoughts in his mind.  </p><p></p><p>No need to rush.</p><p></p><p>Five days after the puppet body returned from Yuanyang Wilderness, Yu Zher arrived, bringing her first-grade top-tier tamed beast, the Azure Python.</p><p></p><p>"I was quite hesitant about whether to let the Azure Python try to break through to the second grade, because I already have a twin-headed Blood Eagle in the early second grade..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Beast."</p><p></p><p>"Letting Tian Qing attempt to break through has a very high chance of failure. What I mean is that Tian Qing may lose control during the breakthrough process."  </p><p></p><p>"However, with you by his side watching over him, it should be much safer."</p><p></p><p>Yu Ke'er stroked the head of a jade green scaled python beast beside her with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Qing python belonged to the top-tier second-grade demonic beast bloodline, which was quite rare. </p><p></p><p>The twin-headed blood hawk was similarly rare.</p><p></p><p>For a younger member of the Yu family to possess two demonic beasts with outstanding bloodlines, it was evident of the profound heritage of this beast taming cultivator family.</p><p></p><p>After consuming a wood-attribute demonic core pill, the Tian Qing python began attempting its breakthrough in the private room.</p><p></p><p>At first, everything went well as the Tian Qing python lay still on the ground, absorbing and refining the medicinal power of the demonic core pill. However, when it started trying to break through, Yu Ke'er's expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>Almost simultaneously, the once calm Tian Qing python erupted with a ferocious demonic aura, as if it was going to go berserk and lose control.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, the Earth Fire Ape that had been on standby immediately pounced on it.</p><p></p><p>Its two burly arms pressed down hard on the Tian Qing python.</p><p></p><p>As if grabbing a small worm.</p><p></p><p>The Black Scale Hawk and Yu Ke'er's twin-headed blood hawk at the early second grade beast taming stage also stood guard, their four hawk eyes glaring fiercely at the trembling and nearly soiled Tian Qing python.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Su Yu carefully approach and use the power of the Qing Mu Sui Lun technique to suppress the raging bloodline aura of the Tian Qing python.</p><p></p><p>After over an hour like this...</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The Tian Qing python successfully broke through, becoming an early second grade beast taming demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Yu Ke'er secretly left a message as a token of gratitude: "At the Spirit Hall auction in Bai Yue Immortal City half a year later, our family will put up two Void Spirit Fruits for auction."</p><p></p><p>The battle between the Yu family and the Huang family at the Eight Demonic Ridge back then caused quite a stir.</p><p></p><p>The end result was that the Yu family seized the Void Spirit Fruit tree.</p><p></p><p>Now the Yu family was putting up two Void Spirit Fruits for auction, perhaps with the intention of mitigating the impact of that incident.</p><p></p><p>Keeping the spoils all to oneself often invites resentment and provokes public outrage.</p><p></p><p>"Void Spirit Fruit." Upon hearing this, Su Yu's heart stirred slightly. After some thought, he had this message delivered back to the Su family through the Cloud Sword Sect's channels.</p><p></p><p>If there really were Void Spirit Fruits, the Su family could send someone to participate in this auction and try to obtain one.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could get one, he would be able to refine the Foundation Establishment Pill.</p><p></p><p>With his current pill refinement skills, even if it was his first time refining the Foundation Establishment Pill, he had a 50-60% chance of success.</p><p></p><p>It was worth a try.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Yu Ke'er was getting familiar with the Tian Qing python after its breakthrough to the early second grade cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>She took meticulous care of it every day and used beast taming arts to deepen her connection and control over it.</p><p></p><p>Over a month later, the Tian Qing python suddenly shed its skin, and two small claws grew on its belly.</p><p></p><p>Yu Ke'er and the old woman Huang Hai Jian looked at the transformed Tian Qing python in shock: "A... a third-grade bloodline!?"</p><p></p><p>In the alley and courtyard...</p><p></p><p>Nearly two months after Wu Yun Gang's 'disappearance', cultivators from the True Palace finally came to investigate his whereabouts, questioning everyone in the alley.  </p><p></p><p>But without exception, they all said that Wu Yun Gang had gone out that day and never returned.</p><p></p><p>The True Palace couldn't find any clues, so they had to give up.</p><p></p><p>After all, although Wu Yun Gang had joined the True Palace, he was merely a first grade talisman master. His disappearance wasn't considered a major incident.</p><p></p><p>Over five months later, Su Zhi appeared in the alley of Bai Yue Immortal City, bringing not only the spirit stones from her family to bid for the Void Spirit Fruit, but also some bad news.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

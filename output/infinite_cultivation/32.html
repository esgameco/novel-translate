        <h1>Chapter 32</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Su Jingbang stated his main purpose for finding Su Yu: "The family needs a batch of elixir pills and talisman papers. Yu'er, the quality of the elixir pills you refine is very good, and you can also refine first-grade medium-quality talisman papers. With this assistance, the family will be more confident in dealing with the Bai family in Maple City."  </p><p></p><p>"For the next six months, the family will fully supply you with materials. You can refine as much as you can."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu nodded in agreement: "No problem."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Su Yu said in a low voice: "As for the materials, prepare some first-grade superior beast hides and essence blood for talisman papers. Let me see if I can refine high-grade talisman papers."</p><p></p><p>Su Jingbang looked at Su Yu in surprise and asked, "You've become a first-grade superior talisman master?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu pondered for a moment, then nodded and said, "Sort of, but the success rate probably won't be good. I still need more practice."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, this is a great blessing!"</p><p></p><p>Su Jingbang excitedly clapped his hands and laughed heartily. The excitement in his heart was indescribable. Even in Cloud Mountain Town, a first-grade superior talisman master was not considered inferior.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention a young man in his twenties.</p><p></p><p>He had only been studying talisman refining for two years!</p><p></p><p>Such talent made Su Jingbang's heart race with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in a few more years, their Su family could produce a second-grade pill refiner and talisman master!</p><p></p><p>After Su Jingbang left, Su Yun looked at Su Yu and said, "I will refine the first-grade superior elixir pills. With your current cultivation at the fifth level of Qi Refining, it would be a bit of a stretch for you to refine first-grade superior elixir pills."</p><p></p><p>"As for first-grade superior talisman papers, don't force yourself either. You can try some, but focus mainly on refining first-grade medium and low-quality ones."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu replied, "I understand, Master, don't worry."</p><p></p><p>Su Yun hesitated for a moment, then said, "Your talent is excellent. With the proper inheritance, becoming a second-grade pill refiner won't be difficult. However, your cultivation is still a bit low, so there's still some time. During this time, I'll try to find you the inheritance of a second-grade pill refiner."</p><p></p><p>It was not easy to obtain second-grade inheritance.</p><p></p><p>Even at the Cloud Mountain Auctions, it was rare to see the inheritance of second-grade pill refiners, talisman masters, or formation masters.</p><p></p><p>And the families possessing such inheritances were reluctant to pass them on externally.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Su Yun had no expectations for the inheritance of a second-grade pill refiner, nor had he thought of seeking it out.</p><p></p><p>Because he was already old, and even if he found the inheritance, he might not be able to become a second-grade pill refiner.</p><p></p><p>Unless he could break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm.</p><p></p><p>But breaking through to the Foundation Establishment Realm itself was an insurmountable obstacle.</p><p></p><p>So the inheritance of a first-grade superior pill refiner was already enough for Su Yun.</p><p></p><p>But Su Yu was different.</p><p></p><p>He had only been studying pill refining and talisman crafting for two or three years, yet he was already at the first-grade superior level.</p><p></p><p>If his cultivation improved and he had the second-grade inheritance, Su Yun absolutely believed he could become a second-grade pill refiner and talisman master.</p><p></p><p>Now was the time to consider the matter of inheritance for him.</p><p></p><p>In the room.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Su Yu.]</p><p>[Cultivation: Qi Refining Realm, Fifth Level.]</p><p>[Lifespan: 24/118.]</p><p>[Techniques: Qingmu Suixuan Technique (One Cycle, Five Rotations, Proficiency 1.64%), Alligator One Hundred and Eight Body Refining Technique (Sixth Layer, Proficiency 37.87%), Blood Whale Devouring Moon Technique (First Realm, Proficiency 0.01%).]</p><p>[Spells: Wood Vine Technique (Mastered), Nurturing Spirit Technique (Mastered), Spirit Javelin Technique (Mastered), Spirit Storing Technique (Mastered), Myriad Wood Vine Technique (Mastered), Spirit Devouring Technique (Mastered).]</p><p></p><p>"Eight years."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the proficiency panel, Su Yu murmured softly.</p><p></p><p>From the time he was eliminated in the Cloud Sword Sect's entrance disciple assessment until now, it had been eight years.</p><p></p><p>And in those eight years, advancing from the first level of the Qi Refining Realm to the fifth level, this speed did not seem slow to Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Compared to an ordinary mid-grade spiritual root, his was about the same. </p><p></p><p>Although not as good as Suqingyi and Suzhi, in Suyu's eyes it was still acceptable.</p><p></p><p>"From the fourth level of Qi cultivation to the fifth level, my lifespan increased by a full nine years." Seeing this, Suyu's eyes flickered slightly.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary Qi cultivators, even at the ninth level of Qi cultivation, taking two first-grade superior longevity pills may only allow them to live to around 120 years old. </p><p></p><p>The Wutong Qingmu Mantra of the Su family had a longevity-enhancing effect, allowing ninth-level Qi cultivators to possibly live to 130 or 140 years old.</p><p></p><p>But the Canmu Suilun Skill he was currently cultivating clearly increased longevity much more than the Wutong Qingmu Mantra.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the ninth level of Qi cultivation, he might be able to live to 160 years old.</p><p></p><p>That's a full 40 years longer than ordinary people!</p><p></p><p>Compared to this, his cultivation speed was actually not slow at all. After all, at the Qi cultivation stage, he could live several decades longer than others.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I still need to find some suitable spells to cultivate."</p><p></p><p>Suyu stayed calmly in the Pill Pavilion, refining pills and drawing talismans. About 50% were first-grade medium-grade pills and talismans, 40% were first-grade low-grade, and the rest were first-grade high-grade.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating, refining pills, drawing talismans.</p><p></p><p>His time was properly scheduled each day, without the slightest delay to his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Because the family was about to get involved in the conflict between the Chen family and the Feng City Bai family, during this period of time, Suyu had 'improved' his success rate in pill refining and talisman drawing a little bit, to about 50%.</p><p></p><p>This success rate was already extremely terrifying. The family had gathered a large amount of first-grade medium and low-grade pill refining and talisman drawing materials.</p><p></p><p>Half of these materials were turned into pills and talismans by Suyu.</p><p></p><p>Spirit Travel Talisman, Golden Light Talisman, Frost Talisman, Fireball Talisman, Wooden Vine Talisman and so on, large batches of first-grade medium and low-grade talismans, after slight optimization by Suyu, had their power slightly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, Suyu had learned a new first-grade high-grade talisman, the Fire Cloud Arrow Talisman.</p><p></p><p>The family had prepared 50 sets of materials, and he successfully drew 21 sets, increasing his proficiency with the Fire Cloud Arrow Talisman to 25%.  </p><p></p><p>He kept seven sets for himself and gave the family 14 sets of Fire Cloud Arrow Talismans.</p><p></p><p>Fourteen first-grade high-grade talisman products matched the success rate of ordinary first-grade high-grade talisman masters, any more would not be appropriate.</p><p></p><p>Half a year later.</p><p></p><p>Suqingyi came to Yunshan Town with Sujingbang, not only to accompany Sujingbang to retrieve pills and talismans, but also to deliver wedding invitations to Suyu and Suzhi.</p><p></p><p>"The wedding is set for a month from now, you must come back then." There was a small scar on Suqingyi's face, no longer showing the youthful innocence of his younger years, only maturity and a hint of viciousness.</p><p></p><p>Suyu could sense a slight aura of bloodshed from Suqingyi.</p><p></p><p>This indicated that Suqingyi had shed quite a bit of blood.</p><p></p><p>Suyu looked at his former young companion and felt pensive, nodding heavily, "I will."</p><p></p><p>After Suqingyi delivered the invitation to Suzhi and left with Sujingbang, Suyun looked at Suyu and said, "Why don't I recommend a marriage for you, Master?"</p><p></p><p>"You have financial and material resources covered, so it's time to consider a cultivation partner."</p><p></p><p>Suyu shook his head with a wry smile, "Master, it's still too early. Right now I only want to focus wholeheartedly on cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Suyun hesitated, then said, "Then wait a few more years. But you can't be like me, so you will need a cultivation partner eventually. Otherwise, how will the family be passed down?"</p><p></p><p>Suyu did not refute this, as he was the junior and disciple, he had to listen to his elders. However, he temporarily would not consider this.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation had no bottlenecks, as long as his proficiency reached the required level he could break through. If he sought a cultivation partner now, what if that person could not keep up with his cultivation in the future?</p><p></p><p>He did not want to invest his emotions, only to then experience life and death separation.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating longevity was his main pursuit for now.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

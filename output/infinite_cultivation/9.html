        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu immediately stopped Su Yu from leaving the medicine garden. He valued Su Yu, his disciple in medicine cultivation, very much: "Don't go back to Jiangcheng for now. The Lin family has sent many people here, setting up ambushes everywhere to scheme against our Su family."</p><p></p><p>"The Third Elder has taken people to deal with this matter, and the clan has also sent people over. I believe the situation will be resolved soon."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu pretended to be ignorant and looked slightly anxious, saying: "Master, why would the Lin family take action against us? How dare they?"</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu hesitated for a moment and said, "You know about the recent appearance of the earth rat demon group in the medicine garden. Although the clan ordered that the news should not be spread outside, the Lin family still found out about it."</p><p></p><p>"The earth rats are demon beasts that specifically dwell near spirit veins, and the spiritual energy in our medicine garden has indeed become much richer in the past year."</p><p></p><p>"This indicates that there is likely a first-grade spirit vein underneath our medicine garden."</p><p></p><p>"Previously, neither our Su family nor the Lin family had a spirit vein, but now that the Lin family knows about this, they naturally cannot remain indifferent."</p><p></p><p>"The group of people outside is probably trying to investigate the truth about the spirit vein."</p><p></p><p>Just as Su Changyu said, not long after Su Qingyi and others were ambushed, the Third Elder Su Chang personally led people to confront the Lin family.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the clan also dispatched several elders to lead teams to cause trouble for the Lin family.</p><p></p><p>In just half a month's time, there were more than thirty large and small conflicts between the two major cultivating families in Jiangcheng.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators from both the Su family and the Lin family suffered injuries.</p><p></p><p>Even the elders from both sides had a battle, but when the Lin family realized they couldn't gain any advantage, they eventually retreated on their own.</p><p></p><p>One month later, Su Yu secretly returned to Jiangcheng, safe and sound.</p><p></p><p>However, after returning to Jiangcheng, Su Yu realized that compared to the current tranquility of the medicine garden, the tense atmosphere between the two families in Jiangcheng seemed unchanged.</p><p></p><p>People on the streets were hurrying about, no longer exhibiting the former peacefulness of Jiangcheng.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu frowned slightly and was walking back to the Su residence when a voice suddenly came from a nearby wine tavern: "Oh? Someone from the Su family?"</p><p></p><p>Before Su Yu could turn to look, a water snake formed from spiritual energy suddenly materialized in the air.</p><p></p><p>Swish!</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the water snake coiled towards Su Yu at an extremely fast speed, as if trying to bind and restrain him.</p><p></p><p>But just as the water snake reached Su Yu's side, blood-colored patterns appeared on Su Yu's body, and his blood energy blazed fiercely. With one fist clenched like a crocodile's powerful claw, he struck out.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The water snake was instantly shattered by the punch.</p><p></p><p>On the third floor of the wine tavern, a young man in his twenties suddenly turned pale.</p><p></p><p>He had just happened to notice Su Yu passing by. He recognized all the young cultivators from the Lin family, but Su Yu was an unfamiliar, youthful face.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, he had sensed that Su Yu's spiritual energy was only at the second level of the Qi Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>He himself was at the third level of the Qi Refining Realm, so dealing with a second-level novice like Su Yu would be like bullying a chicken.</p><p></p><p>So without hesitation, he directly sent out a water snake technique, intending to bind Su Yu and then humiliate and torture him.</p><p></p><p>Little did he expect that his technique would actually be shattered by Su Yu's single punch!</p><p></p><p>"Body Refining Technique?"</p><p></p><p>The young man's expression changed, and without a second thought, he immediately turned to flee, trying to escape from the other side of the wine tavern.</p><p></p><p>But in the next second, there was a loud bang as the wall and windows of the third floor of the wine tavern exploded.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!!!"</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, a beastly roar that made everyone shudder echoed, causing even the third-level Qi Refining young man to instinctively freeze for a moment.</p><p></p><p>And that momentary pause was enough to be fatal.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!!"</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's body was enveloped in a brilliant red glow. His entire being transformed into a nearly ten-foot-tall humanoid alligator figure, moving at a speed far exceeding that of a youth. He leapt from the street and charged into the restaurant, throwing a punch at this person's back.</p><p></p><p>Bang!!!</p><p></p><p>The explosive force of the fourth level of the Alligator Demon's 108 Body Refining Techniques erupted, gushing out like a torrential flow following Su Yu's arm.</p><p></p><p>The youth, whose body was not much stronger than an ordinary person's, was instantly shattered into pieces by Su Yu's punch.</p><p></p><p>Blood splattered, and dismembered limbs and flesh scattered on the ground.</p><p></p><p>He killed the youth.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's eyes turned red with rage as he roared, "You dare to attack me, you're courting death!"</p><p></p><p>In the private room of the restaurant, two beautiful women were so frightened that they went limp on the floor, a faint odor of arousal seeping out from between their legs as they were scared into urinating themselves.</p><p></p><p>The two of them looked at the 'monster' enveloped in red markings with utmost terror.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Su Yu abruptly turned his head and glared at the two of them.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>The two women let out a scream, their eyes rolled back, and they instantly fainted from fright, collapsing to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu snorted, scanning the area, and noticed a fur bag lying in the corner. He quickly picked it up without even opening it to look inside and vanished in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Much later, the restaurant owner finally came to the scene trembling, saw the remains of the Lin Family cultivator reduced to mere chunks of flesh, and let out a wail with eyes wide open, "I'm doomed."</p><p></p><p>A cultivator from the Lin Family had died here. Wouldn't the Lin Family kill him?</p><p></p><p>With this thought, the owner shuddered and turned to flee downstairs, hastily gathering his belongings and family to escape Jiangcheng.</p><p></p><p>The Lin Family didn't learn of this incident until nearly half an hour later when a few cultivators descended upon the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the gruesome scene, the eyes of the Lin Family cultivators turned red with anger.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Xiu!!!"</p><p></p><p>One person roared furiously, "Damn it, to strike with such vicious cruelty, and even dare to kill someone from my Lin Family, the Su Family, do you want to start a war!?"</p><p></p><p>It was too horrific.</p><p></p><p>The few of them swallowed their disgust and collected Lin Xiu's remains, hurriedly taking his corpse back to the family for the elders to preside over justice.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the 'culprit' had already reverted to his original form and quietly returned to the Su Residence's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, you've finally returned," Lingdong said excitedly, rushing over upon seeing Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>If Su Yu hadn't stopped him, Lingdong might have pounced into his embrace.</p><p></p><p>After chatting for a while, Lingdong happily went to prepare Su Yu's dinner for the evening, making it more sumptuous since the Young Master had returned.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu returned to his room and took out the fur bag to examine its contents.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Apart from fifteen low-grade spirit stones, the fur bag also contained a jade vial, a water-attributed cultivation manual, and a water-attributed spell manual.</p><p></p><p>The jade vial contained Qi-refining pills, which should have had ten pills originally, but now only three remained.</p><p></p><p>The water-attributed cultivation manual was called the 'Xuan Shui Jue,' the main practice of the Lin Family that most cultivated. It could be cultivated up to the ninth level of the Qi Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>This contained the first six levels of the manual.</p><p></p><p>As for the water-attributed spell manual, it was called the 'Xuan She Shu,' a formidable offensive and defensive spell.</p><p></p><p>Seeing these gains, Su Yu was overjoyed, "What a huge profit!"</p><p></p><p>No wonder in the past, many gaming tycoons in cultivation games enjoyed being bandits. This way of acquiring external resources was indeed fast and satisfying.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

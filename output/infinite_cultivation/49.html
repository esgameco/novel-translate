        <h1>Chapter 49</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Even though Su Yu had not seen Luo Qianyu, the direct disciple of the great elder of the Cloud Sword Sect, she could still hear some rumors about her in the Cloud Mountain Town market. </p><p></p><p>Luo Qianyu had exceptional talents and was showing signs of becoming the number one inner door disciple of the Cloud Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, there were also many rumors about the Cloud Sword Sect recently. </p><p></p><p>The most noteworthy was about the true Immortal Patriarch of the Cloud Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>It was different from the past when the Cloud Sword Sect produced exceptional talents who could lead the sect to rival the great Moon Palace.  </p><p></p><p>However, after the fall of that exceptional talent, the Cloud Sword Sect had been declining.</p><p></p><p>There were even recent rumors that the life span of the true Immortal Patriarch was nearing its end!</p><p></p><p>Once he fell, the Cloud Sword Sect might be left without a successor!</p><p></p><p>This was the fundamental reason why so many demonic cultivators and renegades had recently appeared within the Cloud Sword Sect's domain.</p><p></p><p>If one investigated this matter deeply, one might discover that it was not simply a threat from demonic cultivators and renegades.</p><p></p><p>Why did these demonic cultivators and renegades surge into the Cloud Sword Sect's domain at this time?  </p><p></p><p>Why had the conflicts and unrest among the various cultivating clans and even scattered cultivators in the Cloud Sword Sect's domain increased and intensified recently?</p><p></p><p>And why did the incident of the Blood Saber Man Luo Bang trying to seize the incomplete supreme treasure Sky Net Umbrella occur?</p><p></p><p>Su Yun said in a low voice, "It is rumored that the true Immortal Patriarch of the Cloud Sword Sect has not appeared for a long time. Currently, the Sect Master and the great elder are not on good terms, so the Sect Master's lineage and the great elder's lineage have very tense relations."</p><p></p><p>"Little Zhi has a decent relationship with Luo Qianyu, the direct disciple of the great elder of the Cloud Sword Sect. Perhaps the Jiang family approached the Su family because of this."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu pondered for a moment and asked, "What kind of person is the eldest legitimate son of the Jiang family's main branch? What is his cultivation level?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yun replied, "That person is named Jiang Zhou. He is forty-nine years old, has one wife and six concubines, and more than a dozen descendants. His current cultivation level is the ninth layer of the Qi Refining Realm."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, even though Su Yu was only at the seventh layer of the Qi Refining Realm at forty years old, he made no attempt to hide his disdain for this Jiang Zhou.</p><p></p><p>"Such a wastrel who breeds like a pig, how dare he take Sister Zhi as a concubine?"</p><p></p><p>"Even I could kill him with one hand now! I am a hundred times better than him!"</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Su Yu had spoken such 'arrogant' words.</p><p></p><p>But now that he was in the Su family, he had the qualifications to say so.</p><p></p><p>One should not be timid forever or live like a dog.</p><p></p><p>One should cultivate when it is time to cultivate, and be firm when one can. If one cannot win, then endure and continue cultivating for a hundred or a thousand years. If one can win, then dare to provoke me?</p><p></p><p>This was Su Yu's character.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing these words, everyone present looked at him with astonished expressions. Su Peng, the father of Su Zhi, even had a somewhat strange look on his face.</p><p></p><p>These wordsâ€”</p><p>Somehow felt off.</p><p></p><p>After a brief moment of surprise, Su Yun, recalling that Su Yu was a first-grade superior pill refiner, talisman master, and puppet master, nodded his head.</p><p></p><p>Su Yun said, "'Killing him with one hand' is indeed no problem."</p><p></p><p>"However, he is the eldest legitimate son of the Jiang family's main branch. You can say you want to kill him here, but don't say it outside for now."</p><p></p><p>The Su family was still too weak to provoke the Jiang family.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I'm not stupid," Su Yu shamelessly nodded and agreed.</p><p></p><p>Su Peng, Su Chang, Su Ruosu, and Su Jingbang were speechless with laughter. The atmosphere was no longer as tense as before.</p><p></p><p>Su Peng looked at Su Yu and asked, "How do you think we should handle this matter?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu shrugged and said, "Naturally, we should refuse. Sister Zhi is a Foundation Establishment cultivator of the Cloud Sword Sect. If the Jiang family wants to drag her down through our Su family, it won't work."</p><p></p><p>"As long as we refuse and let the Jiang family approach Sister Zhi in the Cloud Sword Sect to let her decide for herself, the Jiang family can't do anything to us."</p><p></p><p>"As for Sister Zhi, I don't believe the Jiang family would dare to act recklessly against a Foundation Establishment cultivator of the Cloud Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>"No matter how audacious the Jiang family is, they would not dare to offend the Cloud Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, we still need to strengthen the defensive formations of our family and be on guard, just in case..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Jiang family was in chaos. "If we had stronger defensive formations, we could hold out until reinforcements arrive from the Elders of the Yunjianzong Sect," said Jiang.</p><p></p><p>Su Peng sighed lightly, "Your ancestor told me the same. But this puts a lot of pressure on Xiaozhi."</p><p></p><p>Everyone fell silent for a moment. </p><p></p><p>Excluding Su Zhi, the Su family only had one person, Su Bin, at the Foundation Establishment realm. </p><p></p><p>Even with the Su family's full support, Su Bin had only managed to break through to the second level of the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>But there was still a vast gulf between the Su family and major cultivating clans like the Jiang family in terms of strength, influence, and foundation.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the disparity in power and influence, there was also a difference in resources.</p><p></p><p>The Jiang family could periodically gather materials to refine Foundation Establishment Pills, accumulating resources over many years that allowed them to break through the blockade imposed by major sects like Yunjianzong.</p><p></p><p>The Su family was different - they were still beneath the blockade line at the bottom.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the one flawed Foundation Establishment Pill obtained years ago by spending over five thousand low-grade spirit stones, they had not been able to get another pill in over ten years.</p><p></p><p>Not even a flawed quality one.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu had only managed to gather three of the core ingredients needed to refine Foundation Establishment Pills.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Su Peng looked at Su Yu and said, "You mentioned before that you wanted to leave Yunshan Town and go to Baiyue Immortal City. Now that you're back, do you still plan to go?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu nodded, "Yunshan Town can no longer help me much. Baiyue Immortal City may be better."</p><p></p><p>Su Peng started to speak but stopped, eventually shaking his head, "Baiyue Immortal City is quite far from the clan. If you want to settle there, you'll most likely have to rely on yourself in most cases."</p><p></p><p>He had originally considered whether the clan should follow Su Yu to Baiyue Immortal City and open a pill pavilion branch there.</p><p></p><p>But after thinking it over, Baiyue was too far away for the clan to properly manage affairs there.</p><p></p><p>Instead of that, it would be better to let Su Yu decide for himself.</p><p></p><p>Su Peng looked at Su Yu, "Of course, you may encounter troubles if you go alone. Would you like to take a few people with you?"</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Su Yu politely declined, wanting to go take a look first by himself.</p><p></p><p>Su Peng asked Su Yu to stay at the clan residence for a while longer.</p><p></p><p>Night fell.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu sat cross-legged in the courtyard, looking up at the starry night sky, suddenly reminded of his former maidservant Lindong.</p><p></p><p>After inquiring, he learned that over ten years ago, Lindong had already married and now had three children - the oldest was twelve, and the youngest a three-year-old girl with a low-grade spiritual root of the water attribute.</p><p></p><p>"A water spiritual root?" Su Yu thought of the water attribute cultivation method and spells he had obtained from someone in the Lin family long ago.</p><p></p><p>Under the cover of night, Su Yu sent those along with ten low-grade spirit stones to Lindong.</p><p></p><p>Calculating her age, Lindong must be almost forty now.</p><p></p><p>The next time he saw her, she was no longer the cute and charming young girl from before, but a middle-aged woman.</p><p></p><p>"There is a divide between immortals and mortals," Su Yu thought to himself after returning. "Perhaps I should find a maidservant with a spiritual root and decent cultivating talent."</p><p></p><p>If his maidservant could cultivate, even if her talent was just decent, she could at least accompany him for decades or centuries.</p><p></p><p>However, this was just a thought for now.</p><p></p><p>Why would a female cultivator with decent talent agree to be his maidservant?</p><p></p><p>And he didn't look favorably on ordinary female cultivators either.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu stayed at the clan for a month, taking the opportunity between his cultivation to visit Cangshan Mountain, Jiangcheng City, and tour Lingyue Lake.</p><p></p><p>Lingyue Lake was considered a spiritual place, capable of producing spirit creatures like moonlight fish.</p><p></p><p>However, after circling the lake, Su Yu didn't see any difference between it and an ordinary lake.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps only a geomancer could discern its special qualities.</p><p></p><p>After a month, Su Yu bid farewell to his master, the clan leader, and the elders before setting off for Baiyue Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

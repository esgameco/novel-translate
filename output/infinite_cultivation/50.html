        <h1>Chapter 50</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Four days later.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu traveled northward, passing through the territory of the Bai Family in Maple City. Maple City was slightly larger than River City, but the Bai Family of Maple City did not reside within the city itself, instead living about seventy li outside the city at a place called Tanshan Mountain. </p><p></p><p>He did not enter the city, nor did he go to Tanshan Mountain to invite trouble upon himself.</p><p></p><p>After glancing at Maple City from afar as he passed by, Su Yu continued heading north towards Baiyue Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>However, half a day later, a caravan appeared on the road ahead. </p><p></p><p>Su Yu sensed a few cultivator auras from within the caravan, but paid them no heed as he rode his spirit horse past them side by side.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, a booming shout akin to a man's roar blasted into his ears.</p><p></p><p>"Stop!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Su Yu had no intention of stopping, the man shouted again, "Stop him!"</p><p></p><p>Swish swish swish!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a squad of five cultivators led by one at the seventh level of Qi Refining flashed forward to block Su Yu's path.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man at the seventh level of Qi Refining stood before Su Yu and spoke with relative courtesy, bowing slightly, "This little daoist friend, my family's second young miss has summoned you."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's brows furrowed as he saw the specially constructed enormous carriage in the convoy start to shake. A woman as tall as eight chi, wide enough to be three or four times Su Yu's width, and wearing what looked like a dress, leapt down from the carriage.</p><p></p><p>This woman gazed at the handsome and dashing "pretty boy" Su Yu with great delight and said, "What's your name? And who are you?"</p><p></p><p>"Never mind, I don't need to know. Uncle Huai, I've taken a liking to this man. Take him back to Maple City first. I want him to stay in Maple City and bear children for me!"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's heart stirred slightly as he looked at this mountain of flesh and said, "You're the second young miss of the Bai Family of Maple City?"</p><p></p><p>The woman's presence was overwhelmingly oppressive, but more importantly, this second young miss of the Bai Family of Maple City was actually a ninth level cultivator of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing his words, the woman nodded, "That's right. Since you know who I am, obediently come back to Maple City with me!"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu wondered, "Aren't you afraid that I might be an inner disciple of the Cloud Sword Sect? Or a disciple of some other great clan?"</p><p></p><p>The woman grinned, her eyes turning into slits as she was utterly bewitched by Su Yu's handsome face, unable to control her inner desires.</p><p></p><p>She said, "So what if you are? Can you escape? You're only at the seventh level of Qi Refining. If you come with me to Maple City obediently, things will be better for you. I'm not going to do anything to you, I just want you to bear children for me."</p><p></p><p>"Even the Cloud Sword Sect can't intervene in something like this."</p><p></p><p>"Besides, it's not like I haven't captured Cloud Sword Sect disciples before, it's just..." She gazed at Su Yu with piggish infatuation, "They can't compare to you, they're far from being as good as you!"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's body was covered in goosebumps as a chill ran down his spine. </p><p></p><p>He was slightly shocked, imagining the trauma Lin Danlang may have suffered under this woman - cough, at her hands.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Danlang had been through such an ordeal?</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it made Su Yu shudder with revulsion.</p><p></p><p>"This is really too much for my eyes!!!"</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu roared furiously and suddenly erupted with killing intent. The Bai Family cultivator at the seventh level of Qi Refining, less than five zhang away from him, changed expression.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to attack, vines appeared from the heavens and instantly bound Su Yu in place.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>He erupted with all his spiritual power but was unable to break through the vines at all.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man's eyes widened in disbelief. As fellow cultivators at the seventh level of Qi Refining, how was this possible?</p><p></p><p>In the next moment.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The vines shattered as Su Yu's Body Refining technique erupted with power. His entire body expanded, muscles bulging like crouching dragons, covered in scarlet patterns like the scales of an alligator demon. A ferocious aura like that of a monster burst forth.</p><p></p><p>With just a single punch, Su Yu had already shattered the vine prison restraining the seventh level Qi Refining cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Vine fragments scattered through the air, along with that seventh level cultivator's body...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Those who were like mighty alligators with one punch from Su Yu were all smashed. </p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p>A number of wooden vines entangled the remaining four cultivators at the Qi Refining realm.</p><p>Su Yu didn't even need to move a finger himself.</p><p>In mid-air, numerous wooden vines transformed into wooden spikes and javelins, piercing those four cultivators at the 4th and 5th levels of the Qi Refining realm until they looked like porcupines.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhh!"</p><p>"Puchi!" </p><p></p><p>Accompanied by piercing screams echoing in the wilderness, in the blink of an eye,</p><p>The five cultivators from the Feng Cheng Bai Family who tried to intercept Su Yu were all dead.</p><p></p><p>That meat mountain, no, it should be the second young lady of the Feng Cheng Bai Family, her face changed color, her eyes flashed with ferocity, her anger soared, and she forced her meaty eye sockets open a crack to glare at Su Yu, roaring: "How dare you kill my people right in front of me!"</p><p></p><p>"I was going to let you live in bliss, but now, you're only fit to be a dog!"</p><p></p><p>"Dang dang dang!"</p><p></p><p>The second young lady of the Feng Cheng Bai Family suddenly charged out, like a ferocious raging beast, stomping with each step, causing the ground to tremble as if a stampede of beasts was rushing.</p><p></p><p>Weng!</p><p></p><p>A yellow earth-colored radiance flashed from her body, the eruption of earth elemental powers made her seem like a great mountain.</p><p></p><p>As she abruptly charged forward, that overbearing aura made even Su Yu a bit nervous.</p><p></p><p>Strike quickly and decisively!</p><p>Can't drag this out!</p><p></p><p>Su Yu waved his big hand, a black radiance fell in front of him, transforming into a huge figure over 20 feet tall that resembled a giant eagle yet had a dragon's tail - a bizarre puppet beast.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!" The dragon-eagle puppet beast let out a ferocious roar the moment it appeared, valiantly and invincibly pouncing towards the second young lady of the Feng Cheng Bai Family.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The dragon-eagle's claw clashed against the second lady's fist imprint spell.</p><p>The spell imprint shattered instantly under its claw.</p><p>The second lady's face changed slightly, and the next moment, the dragon-eagle's claw struck her body.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The yellow earth radiance flared up, as the second lady, mountain-like in stature, was sent flying back by the dragon-eagle's claw strike.</p><p></p><p>"A top-tier first-rank puppet beast!? No, this power is almost at the Foundation Establishment realm! How is it possible, how could you have such a powerful puppet beast!" The second lady shrieked in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Even though her cultivation focused on the physical body and defense, at this moment she was struck by the dragon-eagle puppet beast's claw, her internal organs jolted, blood dripping from the corner of her mouth, dizzy and dazed.</p><p></p><p>This showed just how powerful the dragon-eagle puppet beast's strength was.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Without a word, a talisman appeared in Su Yu's hand.</p><p>As he infused it with his spiritual power, the Thunder-Fire Talisman was flung out by his waving hand.</p><p>Still in mid-air, it suddenly transformed into a blazing thunderbolt.</p><p></p><p>"Ka-cha!"</p><p></p><p>The sky abruptly darkened, and a crimson thunderbolt thicker than the second lady's figure struck down from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The second lady was still flying back when her eyes widened, watching helplessly as the thunderbolt struck her body.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!!"</p><p></p><p>The yellow earth defensive barrier around her body flared up again, but shattered instantly.</p><p>The next moment, her body was blasted apart by the thunderbolt.</p><p>Chunks of scorched flesh scattered all around like shattered charcoal.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Some ordinary people from the caravan screamed, trying to flee, but in the next instant, vines appeared to bind them, followed by wooden spikes piercing their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Those ordinary members of the Feng Cheng Bai Family in the caravan all died with unwillingness and fear.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu collected the interspatial bags and magical treasures from the second lady and the other five cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The second lady's ugly dress was actually a mid-grade defensive treasure, but it was completely shattered by the low-grade second-rank Thunder-Fire Talisman.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu put away the dragon-eagle puppet beast, then swiftly summoned a flying sword and abandoned the spirit horse, fleeing the area at low altitude on the sword.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

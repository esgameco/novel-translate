        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Refining tools, talisman papers, array formations and other side occupations might be a bit troublesome for him to learn, but studying pill refining was very easy. </p><p></p><p>Because the Su family was most skilled in cultivating spirit herbs, over many years they had developed expertise, making progress in both herbalists and pill refiners.</p><p></p><p>They even opened a pill pavilion business in the cultivator's town under the Cloud Sword Sect, used for selling spirit herbs and pills.</p><p></p><p>"However, to learn pill refining it's best to first become a herb disciple at the herb fields, identifying spirit herbs. After becoming accomplished, you can then take a pill refining elder of the family as a master," Su Yu hesitated slightly.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the family to go to the herb fields, although there were powerful family members guarding it, there were still some safety risks to a degree. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, demon beasts would sometimes attack the herb fields.</p><p></p><p>Secretly, they also had to guard against the Lin family causing trouble.</p><p></p><p>After hesitating briefly, Su Yu gritted his teeth and still decided to go to the herb fields as a herb disciple. Now was the best time to be a herb disciple, as he currently had quite a lot of free time that shouldn't be wasted.</p><p></p><p>After becoming accomplished, he would be able to study the art of pill refining, which would benefit his future cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Compared to that, the minor risks of going to the herb fields were nothing, still bearable.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as a herb disciple he could also receive a monthly resource allowance.</p><p></p><p>After thinking it through clearly, Su Yu found the great elder and took a mission to go to the herb fields as a herb disciple. The great elder Su Mengshan smiled: "The herb fields happen to be short-handed. Take this token, I'll have someone take you to the herb fields to find your uncle Su Yongyu. He's an old herbalist, learning the art from him is definitely right."</p><p></p><p>Taking the identity token to enter and exit the great array of the herb fields, Su Yu followed an elder of the family at the sixth layer of qi refining to the herb fields.</p><p></p><p>The herb fields were not too far from Jiangcheng City, but still a few hundred li away, located in a desolate mountain range, spanning a vast area of over ten thousand mu.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the spirit qi issue, although this herb field could grow spirit herbs, at most it could only grow some not-so-precious first-grade spirit herbs. It allowed the Su family to earn some money and establish a foothold, but there was no way for them to prosper greatly.</p><p></p><p>This herb field was the Su family's most important foundation, protected by layered great arrays. Entering the herb field with the identity token, the scenery suddenly opened up, with several mist-shrouded mountains and valleys appearing before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's heart was slightly amazed, as he discovered the spirit qi here at the herb fields was actually denser than at the Su family's manor.</p><p></p><p>The herb fields were vast, with no lack of Su family members here. Besides over a hundred cultivators, there were also hundreds of ordinary clansmen and menial workers.</p><p></p><p>At a mid-mountain location, a large manor had been built, with hundreds of small houses in total.</p><p></p><p>Su Yongyu was a cultivator who had been at the herb fields for nearly thirty years. Because his spirit root wasn't very good, barely able to cultivate, even after decades his cultivation was only at the third layer of qi refining.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely for this reason that he chose to remain at the herb fields, responsible for cultivating spirit herbs, while also training herbalists and herb disciples for the family.</p><p></p><p>When they met him, Su Yongyu was leading three herb disciples working busily in the herb fields.</p><p></p><p>"Yongyu, I've brought you a new person. His name is Su Yu, and from now on he'll be a herb disciple under you." After handing Su Yu over to Su Yongyu, the elder who had brought Su Yu did not linger, leaving the herb fields afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Su Yongyu looked like a farmer, not very tall at around seven chi, wearing ordinary clothes, with tanned skin, a burly build and an honest face.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Yu's clean brocade robes, Su Yongyu laughed: "It's good you've come. Young people should learn some skills, can't just rely on the family to support you forever. What's more, if you want to have a wife and children, you'll need to work even harder."</p><p></p><p>The three herb disciples beside him were all older than Su Yu, with the youngest already in his twenties, having been at the herb fields for five or six years.</p><p></p><p>The oldest was already over thirty years old.</p><p></p><p>At that age, if they stayed longer, they could become full-fledged herbalists at the herb fields.</p><p></p><p>Herb disciples at the fields only had two paths: one was to remain at the herb fields, waiting for the day to take charge and become a herbalist.</p><p></p><p>The other was to leave and seek an opportunity to become a pill refining disciple under a pill refining master, perhaps one day becoming an official pill refiner themselves.</p><p></p><p>However, such opportunities were not many.</p><p></p><p>The three busy disciples just glanced at Su Yu, smiled faintly and nodded slightly in greeting, before continuing their work.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu bowed respectfully: "Master."</p><p></p><p>Su Yongyu smiled and nodded, then took out...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>A booklet was handed to him, with the words: "This contains records of the spiritual herbs cultivated in the herb fields, including their properties, growth habits, etc., as well as some spells needed for cultivating spiritual herbs."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, what cultivation method do you practice?" </p><p></p><p>Su Yu replied: "The Green Wood Incantation of the Catalpa Tree, currently at the second level."</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu's eyes lit up and he said: "That's a good method. Have you studied spirit cultivation techniques?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu nodded: "Yes."</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu happily said: "Then I'll give you half a month's time to memorize this booklet, after which I'll take you to cultivate spiritual herbs."</p><p></p><p>The booklet was a good thing. After thanking Su Changyu, Su Yu was arranged by him to stay in an empty house in the herb field manor for the time being to settle down.</p><p></p><p>Every day, apart from cultivating his martial arts and body refining techniques, he memorized the knowledge about the habits of various spiritual herbs from that booklet.</p><p></p><p>This was the foundation for becoming a herb cultivator, and also the foundation for becoming a pill refiner.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the knowledge about spiritual herbs, there were also records of several spells later on, including the Spiritual Rain spell of the water attribute, the Earth Spirit spell of the earth attribute, the Spirit Nurturing spell of the wood attribute, and so on. There was another wood attribute spell called the Spirit Infusion spell.</p><p></p><p>Its function was to infuse spiritual perception into wood spirits, expanding one's spiritual perception and sensory range. When cultivated to a profound level, one could sense the growth state of nearby spiritual herbs with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>Apart from being used for cultivating spiritual herbs, this spell could also be used for setting up alerts or searching for spiritual herbs in the wild, making it quite formidable.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this spell was greatly helpful for practicing pill refining and becoming a pill refiner, with many benefits.</p><p></p><p>However, it was quite difficult to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was for others. For Su Yu, it was only a matter of time needed to accumulate proficiency.</p><p></p><p>When he saw this spell, Su Yu decided to practice the Spirit Infusion spell next.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the spiritual energy in the herb fields was denser than at the manor, slightly increasing Su Yu's cultivation speed.</p><p></p><p>On the third night after Su Yu arrived at the herb fields, there were suddenly a few shouts from outside: "Demonic beasts! Quick, stop them, they've come to steal spiritual herbs again!"</p><p></p><p>There was a commotion for a while before it finally quieted down, as if two demonic beasts had been killed, but some had also escaped.</p><p></p><p>At first, Su Yu thought it was just some demonic beasts attracted by the herb fields and accidentally wandering in.</p><p></p><p>But a few days later, there were traces of demonic beasts appearing in the herb fields again.</p><p></p><p>This time, he overheard the discussion of a few senior fellow cultivators outside.</p><p></p><p>"They're here again, why have demonic beasts been appearing so frequently lately?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard these demonic beasts are called Rock Moles, a kind of burrow-dwelling pack beast, and they..."</p><p></p><p>"Supposedly, Rock Mole demon packs mostly dwell above spirit veins."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be? Was that rumor from before actually true?"</p><p></p><p>"Most likely, didn't the master previously tell us not to discuss this matter?"</p><p></p><p>"That would be great then, it's right not to discuss it. If it's really like that, then the Su Family might just soar to new heights, surpassing the Lin Family in one fell swoop."</p><p></p><p>Inside the room, Su Yu's heart skipped a beat upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Rock Moles?</p><p></p><p>He was familiar with these minor demonic beasts, shaped like rats but the size of cats or dogs.</p><p></p><p>Adept at digging tunnels, they could burrow through soil or rock.</p><p></p><p>In his past life's cultivation game, they were a pack beast he often had to clear out in the early stages. Their living habit was to dwell along spirit veins, feeding on spirit stones or nearby rocks.</p><p></p><p>So to protect the safety of spirit veins, Rock Moles had to be frequently cleared out.</p><p></p><p>From the current situation in the herb fields, the Rock Moles must have just appeared here, which meant...</p><p></p><p>There was likely a first-grade spirit vein hidden beneath the herb fields or nearby.</p><p></p><p>The lowest grade of spirit vein.</p><p></p><p>But even the lowest grade spirit vein was still a spirit vein.</p><p></p><p>Currently, neither the Su Family nor the Lin Family had a spirit vein as the foundation for their cultivation lineages.</p><p></p><p>If this news spread, would the Lin Family just watch as the Su Family monopolized the spirit vein?</p><p></p><p>There were also other cultivation forces or families nearby who might catch wind of this and take action.</p><p></p><p>By then, the herb fields could be in danger.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Su Yu immediately became restless.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

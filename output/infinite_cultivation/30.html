        <h1>Chapter 30</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The downfall of the Lin family may have been just a simple sentence, but this is the harsh reality of the cultivation world. </p><p></p><p>Every day, cultivators fall, and every day, cultivation families decline or are annihilated.</p><p></p><p>A large part of this is due to feuds between families. </p><p></p><p>The Lin family and the Su family, two small cultivation families, were destined to have only one remain in Jiangcheng since they discovered a first-grade spirit vein in Cangshan Mountain.</p><p></p><p>If the Lin family had previously been able to defeat the Su family, or at least drive them away and occupy the spirit vein, then the Lin family would have taken the initiative. </p><p></p><p>As long as they absorbed the blessings from the spirit vein, allowing a member of the Lin family to reach the Foundation Establishment realm, it would have been the Su family facing annihilation.</p><p></p><p>However, the current situation is that the Su family has guarded the spirit vein, and by a fortuitous opportunity, spent an immense price to obtain a Foundation Establishment pill, allowing the fifth elder Su Bin to successfully break through to the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>It was this one Foundation Establishment cultivator that completely shattered the balance of power between the Su and Lin families.</p><p></p><p>The Su family rose an entire level.  </p><p></p><p>When they turn back to deal with the Lin family, it would truly be like casually crushing an ant.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, the Su family can be called the Su family of Jiangcheng. With the Lin family gone, the Su family controls a first-grade spirit vein territory, a medicine garden, a Spirit Moon Lake, as well as the four major industries of the town and pill pavilion."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu listed the current assets of the family, which were quite substantial. </p><p></p><p>Enough to support the Su family's power and strength to rise another level.</p><p></p><p>As long as they remain steady and stable, the Su family would not have to worry about resources for the next twenty or thirty years and could focus on developing.</p><p></p><p>The first-grade spirit vein could produce over a thousand low-grade spirit stones per year.</p><p></p><p>The medicine garden's annual output was around a thousand low-grade spirit stones.  </p><p></p><p>The pill pavilion was better, currently able to produce around two to three thousand low-grade spirit stone pills.</p><p></p><p>If the Spirit Moon Lake's moonlight fish reproduced well, it could have an annual output worth two thousand low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Added up, that was six to seven thousand low-grade spirit stones per year.</p><p></p><p>After deducting the cost of maintaining the family, they could save one to two thousand spirit stones per year.</p><p></p><p>"At the pill pavilion, I can use premium-grade spirit pills to increase sales, allowing the family to earn a few hundred more spirit stones per year," Su Yu calculated in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of so many spirit stones, Su Yu's eyes shone brightly.</p><p></p><p>He hoped that in the time to come, the family could have one or two more Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p></p><p>That way, the Su family's strength would be considered a powerful cultivation family within the Cloud Sword Sect's domain, and he would gain more security.</p><p></p><p>News of the Lin family's downfall caused Su Yun to hold celebratory banquets at the pill pavilion for three consecutive days, even getting drunk once. While drunk, he pulled his disciple Su Yu aside, laughing and crying as he recounted past events.</p><p></p><p>In the family, Su Yun was considered to be of Su Yu's grandfather's generation.</p><p></p><p>Many of Su Yun's father's generation and elders had been killed or severely injured by the Lin family when he was young.</p><p></p><p>These bloody debts accumulated into a feud, or one could say a mortal enmity, between the elders of the Su family and the Lin family.</p><p></p><p>"Over twenty years ago, our Su family was almost annihilated. That time, we narrowly avoided being wiped out by the Lin family. Fortunately, the old patriarch fought to the death and killed that old bastard from the Lin family, severely injuring one of their Qi Condensation cultivators at the ninth level as well."</p><p></p><p>"Who could have imagined that now, the Lin family would actually be annihilated by our Su family!"</p><p></p><p>Su Yun spoke with a slurred tongue after drinking too much.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Yu could see that his master was extremely happy, happier than he had ever been before.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Yun so happy made Su Yu happy as well.</p><p></p><p>The effects of the spiritual wine were quite potent. The next day after sobering up, Su Yun found Su Yu with a hangover and asked in a low voice, "I didn't embarrass myself yesterday, did I?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu shook his head: "No."</p><p></p><p>However, the half-foot tall, completely red-furred Earth Fire Ape at their feet kept nodding, waving its hands while chittering, its expression fluctuating between laughter and tears, reenacting Su Yun's behavior from the previous day.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be saying that you did...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Oh no, how embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>Su Yun's face darkened, and he said through gritted teeth to Su Yu, "Its spiritual intelligence is actually not high, right? So it doesn't know anything, right?" </p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Fire Ape immediately became displeased. With a flash, it climbed onto Su Yu's shoulder, hands on its hips, glaring with its fiery red eyes at Su Yun and muttering a few words to him.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Yun couldn't understand what it was saying.</p><p></p><p>It was only after Su Yu gave it a bottle of Beast Pill that it was finally appeased.</p><p></p><p>After sobering up, Su Yun returned to his usual self, though not as cold as before. He left most of the affairs of the Dan Pavilion to Su Yu to handle.</p><p></p><p>Normally, he only refined first-grade superior spirit pills, leaving the other pills and matters to Su Yu's responsibility.</p><p></p><p>Because now, the first-grade middle and lower spirit pills refined by Su Yu were of better quality than the ones he made himself.</p><p></p><p>The increasing quality of the Dan Pavilion's spirit pills also attracted more customers to the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>At the Chen Family's West Water Estate...</p><p></p><p>In midair above a water channel, Su Qingyi roared as he controlled a golden seal that had transformed into a small mountain, smashing it down on a Qi Cultivation Stage Seven powerful enemy whose consciousness was already becoming muddled, pounding him from the air into the ground on the opposite bank.</p><p></p><p>By the time Su Qingyi lifted the golden seal, the enemy's body had turned into a meat patty.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the tension in Su Qingyi's mind finally eased.</p><p></p><p>"Pffft."</p><p></p><p>Su Qingyi spat out a mouthful of blood, his body swaying unsteadily. He quickly and carefully landed on the ground, took out a first-grade middle spirit pill gifted by Su Yu from his cosmic bag, and swallowed it.</p><p></p><p>Without time to recuperate, he went to the opposite bank and skillfully looted the body, taking the enemy's cosmic bag and a defensive magic treasure.</p><p></p><p>Then he hurriedly found the unconscious Chen Sisi, picked her up, and rushed back towards the Chen Family estate.</p><p></p><p>They had encountered people from the Feng City's Bai Family.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the trump cards he had, Chen Sisi's strength, and the mind-muddling potion, the two of them might have perished this time.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later...</p><p></p><p>A group found this place and, seeing the three dead bodies, became furious.</p><p></p><p>"Not only did they fail to kill Chen Sisi, but they were killed in return? Useless!"</p><p></p><p>"Chen Sisi wasn't alone, there seemed to be an outside male cultivator with her!"</p><p></p><p>"Looking at the traces, it was probably because of that outsider!"</p><p></p><p>"How dare he kill people from my Bai Family! Find out who he is!"</p><p></p><p>The group glared hatefully towards the Chen Family's direction, taking the three clansmen's corpses back with them.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Feng City's Bai Family welcomed a few guests.</p><p></p><p>In order to deal with the Chen Family and the purple-gold sand vein, the Bai Family had already paid a heavy price.</p><p></p><p>Su Qingyi stayed at the Chen Family estate for over a month, taking care of the severely injured Chen Sisi. Not long after, Su Qingyi learned of a piece of news that made him overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Chen Sisi beside him, pondered for a moment, and gritted his teeth before going to find the Chen Family patriarch.</p><p></p><p>In Cloud Mountain Town Market...</p><p></p><p>Recently, Cloud Mountain Town Market has been quite unpeaceful. Bandit cultivators would appear from time to time, robbing and killing passing cultivators or merchants. Although the Cloud Sword Sect dispatched more disciples and experts to hunt the bandits, treating the symptoms but not the root cause, goods from several merchant shops were robbed, and more than a dozen cultivators traveling to the market were killed, making the people in the market anxious.</p><p></p><p>It had been a year since the last auction, but the number of bandit cultivators outside seemed to be increasing rather than decreasing.</p><p></p><p>The people in the market felt a slight sense of unease, with a tense atmosphere lingering.</p><p></p><p>At the Heavenly Book Pavilion...</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Yu's arrival, the old clerk's eyes lit up as he greeted him, "Little Friend Su has come? What would you like this time? I've just received a batch of exquisite ancient jade boxes. They absolutely come from good places - who knows, a great opportunity might be hidden inside. Would you like to open a few?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

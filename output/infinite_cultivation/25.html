        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"The Bai family of Fengcheng is skilled in the art of talisman crafting. They made their fortune by refining talismans. Although the Bai family currently only has two Elders at the Foundation Establishment realm, their strength far exceeds that of ordinary cultivating clans at the Foundation Establishment level."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps only a cultivating force like the Yu family of Black Rock Mountain, which has its own unique backing, could suppress them."</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder, Su Yun, shook his head slightly and calmly said, "However, that's the Bai family of Fengcheng, not the Lin family."</p><p></p><p>"Even if someone from the Lin family marries into the Bai family, the Bai family would not send their Foundation Establishment Elders to deal with us for the sake of the Lin family."</p><p></p><p>"At most, they would just provide some talismans to the Lin family."</p><p></p><p>Su Yun saw things clearly.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the Bai family would not make a big move for the sake of the insignificant Su family. However, with the Bai family's support, the Lin family relied on the power of talismans and once again set their sights on seizing the first-grade spirit vein of Cangshan Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The friction between the Su family and the Lin family reignited, and the Su family suffered more losses in the conflict.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, after the Su family employed the Bewildering Spirit Liquid, they managed to regain their disadvantage in the conflict with the Lin family.</p><p></p><p>The Bai family did not intervene in the dispute between the Lin and Su families, so the Su family was not in immediate danger.</p><p></p><p>For the next two years, such friction between the two families never ceased.</p><p></p><p>The Lin family even attempted to use second-grade low-rank talismans to break through the Cangshan Mountain Formation and seize the spirit vein.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, they were all driven back by the Su family, and both sides suffered losses.</p><p></p><p>In the Yunshan Market, the Su Family Pill Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu skillfully opened the pill furnace in front of him, revealing five jade-green Buddha's Hand Fruit-sized pill pellets inside.</p><p></p><p>Unlike ordinary pill pellets, these five pellets had distinct and clearly visible patterns on them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, although these were only first-grade mid-rank Qi Refining Pills, the spiritual energy and medicinal potency of the pellets were exceptionally pure and concentrated, possessing an indescribable profundity.</p><p></p><p>These were Pill Patterns!</p><p></p><p>For ordinary first-grade mid-rank pill refiners, a 30% success rate in pill refining was considered profitable.</p><p></p><p>If they could refine a premium first-grade mid-rank pill pellet, they would be considered elite first-grade mid-rank pill refiners.</p><p></p><p>However, premium pill pellets were difficult to refine. Even first-grade high-rank pill refiners might not be able to produce premium pellets every time they refined first-grade mid-rank pills.</p><p></p><p>As for perfect pill pellets, they were almost legendary or mythical.</p><p></p><p>Because perfect pill pellets could achieve 100% efficacy, they would form unique Pill Patterns and contain a trace of the profound mysteries of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Don't underestimate this trace, as for ordinary cultivators, it was no less valuable than a heavenly treasure.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps at certain critical moments, it could play a decisive role.</p><p></p><p>For instance, when you were about to break through but lacked the final push.</p><p></p><p>"The proficiency in refining first-grade mid-rank Qi Refining Pills has reached perfection," Su Yu said, slowly recovering his spiritual power as he looked at the five perfect pill pellets in the furnace with satisfaction and nodded.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand, storing the five perfect first-grade mid-rank Qi Refining Pills in a jade bottle.</p><p></p><p>Then, he sat cross-legged, closed his eyes, and nourished his spirit, replenishing the spiritual energy he had expended during the refining process and easing the slight ache in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Refining perfect pill pellets with Pill Patterns was still so difficult and draining on the mind.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps when his cultivation reached the fifth or even sixth level of the Qi Refining Realm, he would find it easier to refine these pills. For now, he felt quite exhausted.</p><p></p><p>After recovering, Su Yu opened his eyes, took out a perfect first-grade mid-rank Qi Refining Pill from the jade bottle, and swallowed it whole.</p><p></p><p>The medicinal potency of the pill instantly erupted within his body, with an effect slightly better than an ordinary first-grade high-rank Qi Refining Pill.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, there was that trace of the profound mysteries of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>With this, Su Yu found it slightly easier to cultivate the Qing Wood Yearly Cycle Technique.</p><p></p><p>Two hours later, the effects of the Qi Refining Pill wore off.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Suyu also finished cultivating the Cangmu Suixun Gong today. </p><p></p><p>To break through from the fourth to the fifth cycle of the Cangmu Suixun Gong, which is the fifth level of the Qi Refining realm, it would likely take five years.</p><p></p><p>With the assistance of Qi Refining Pills, the speed could be faster, but it would still take around four years. </p><p></p><p>Currently, he was still 19% short of the proficiency required for the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that today's cultivation progress was a bit faster than yesterday's, Suyu thought to himself: "The perfect pills do help me more."</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, I'll cultivate using the perfect Qi Refining Pills."</p><p></p><p>More than a year ago, he had already become a first-grade middle-rank pill refiner, but in order to temper his pill refining skills and improve his proficiency in various pill formulas, he had not attempted first-grade top-rank pills.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, his cultivation base was not high enough to support it.</p><p></p><p>This was the main reason.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, he was not in a hurry. By improving the proficiency of the first-grade middle-rank pill formulas, his foundation would be more solid.</p><p></p><p>By today, among the first-grade middle-rank pills, he had already achieved perfect proficiency in nine formulas, with a 100% success rate, and could even refine perfect pattern pills.</p><p></p><p>However, he had not revealed his true level.</p><p></p><p>Outwardly, he was still just a pill refiner with a success rate of around 40%, occasionally able to refine first-grade middle-rank spirit pills.</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining materials, he had refined them into the pills he needed.</p><p></p><p>Those materials were enough to support his daily cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Suyu, Chensi Si from the Cloud Sword Sect has brought two people saying they want to see you," Suqing Yi found Suyu and said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Compared to two years ago, Suqing Yi's appearance had changed quite a bit and become more mature.</p><p></p><p>In the past two years, whenever Suqing Yi had time, he would go out to hunt demonic beasts. His gains were not mentioned, but after these experiences, Suqing Yi's demeanor had undergone a qualitative transformation compared to before.</p><p></p><p>However, in contrast to Suqing Yi's talent in Qi Refining, his talent in pill refining was indeed a mess.</p><p></p><p>Even though Suyu would occasionally give him guidance, after two years, Suqing Yi had only barely become a first-grade lower-rank pill refiner in the Pill Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>So even though Suqing Yi's cultivation was about to break through to the sixth level of the Qi Refining realm, his status in the Pill Pavilion was still lower than Suyu's.</p><p></p><p>"Chensi Si?" Suyu recalled the icy-like junior sister from when they had hunted the Zuo Mountain Eagle before.</p><p></p><p>His impression was a bit vague, as it had been more than two years since he had seen her.</p><p></p><p>Why was she suddenly looking for him?</p><p></p><p>Suyu was a bit puzzled, but he did not neglect her. Together with Suqing Yi, he walked into the front courtyard of the Pill Pavilion and saw Chensi Si, who had undergone some subtle changes, as well as a young girl beside her and an old woman standing behind them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Suyu, Chensi Si showed a slight smile and said, "Fellow Daoist Su, I haven't congratulated you on becoming a first-grade middle-rank pill refiner."</p><p></p><p>Suyu sensed the aura of the sixth level of the Qi Refining realm from Chensi Si and smiled, "I'm still at the fourth level of the Qi Refining realm, but Fellow Daoist Chen has already reached the sixth level. As expected of a disciple of the Cloud Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>The young girl frowned slightly, interrupting the courteous exchange between the two, "I heard you have a kind of medicine here that can subdue a late-stage first-rank demonic beast?"</p><p></p><p>"How much? I want a bottle."</p><p></p><p>Suyu looked at the young girl, and Chensi Si hurriedly introduced her in a low voice, "This is the youngest legitimate daughter of the third branch of the Yu Family from Black Rock Mountain, Yu Zhuan'er."</p><p></p><p>"She has taken a fancy to a late-stage first-rank demonic beast with decent bloodline and wants to capture it alive and tame it, so she needs to use a Mind Muddling Liquid."</p><p></p><p>"Recently, my family has encountered some troubles and wants to establish a connection with the Yu Family."</p><p></p><p>Chensi Si bit her red lip and pleaded softly to Suyu, "Brother Su, please help me with this. I'm willing to owe you a great favor."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

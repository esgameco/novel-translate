        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Cloud Sword Sect. </p><p></p><p>Outer Sect Trial Peak, Refining Spirit Platform.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu woke up with a pale face covered in cold sweat, still not fully conscious, when a voice reached his ears: "Su Yu, ranked tenth in the third trial of Divine Intent."</p><p></p><p>On a high platform, several Cloud Sword Sect elders slightly shook their heads as they looked at Su Yu's information.  </p><p></p><p>"His score for this trial is not bad, considered above average."</p><p></p><p>"However, he only has a lower-grade spirit root, and his comprehension in the second trial was also lower. Plus, his age is already at the threshold of sixteen."</p><p></p><p>"Eliminate him."  </p><p></p><p>"I second the elimination."</p><p></p><p>This year, there were over three hundred candidates taking the Cloud Sword Sect's disciple admission test, but only thirty spots available.</p><p></p><p>Although Su Yu's score in the third trial was decent, his lower-grade spirit root and poor comprehension were fatal flaws. His third trial score was not enough for the Cloud Sword Sect to make an exception and admit him.</p><p></p><p>As one young man and woman after another woke up on the Refining Spirit Platform, the results of the third Divine Intent trial were announced.</p><p></p><p>This trial tested the stability of one's spirit root foundation and the strength of their willpower.</p><p></p><p>Hence, it was called the Divine Intent trial.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Yu, with your great score in the third trial, you should have a chance to join the Cloud Sword Sect, right?" Su Qingyi, a fellow clansman, said with a hint of envy and frustration.</p><p></p><p>His scores in the first two trials were decent, with a middle-grade spirit root and lower-middle comprehension. However, he ranked in the sixties for the third Divine Intent trial.</p><p></p><p>With that score, he basically had no chance of joining the Cloud Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu didn't respond. This clansman had a rather arrogant personality, and his words were not because he truly believed Su Yu had a chance to join the sect, but purely to comment on his score.</p><p></p><p>If Su Yu had ranked in the top three for the third trial, perhaps the Cloud Sword Sect would have made an exception to admit him as a disciple.</p><p></p><p>But ranking tenth...</p><p></p><p>With his lower-grade spirit root and lower comprehension, it was basically impossible.</p><p></p><p>A young woman beside them frowned slightly and chided, "Qingyi, don't speak."</p><p></p><p>"Sister, I really think Brother Yu can make it, after all, his third trial score is even better than yours," Su Qingyi said in a low voice, glancing at Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>The woman didn't respond.</p><p></p><p>The three of them were from the same clan, the Su Family, a cultivating family in Jiangcheng City. The woman was Su Zhi, the eldest young miss of the Su Family, and also the one with the best talent among the three.</p><p></p><p>With an upper-middle grade spirit root, upper-middle comprehension, and ranking twenty-first in the Divine Intent trial, which was also considered upper-middle, her admission into the Cloud Sword Sect should not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, an elder on the nearby high platform released his aura and declared, "Silence! The list of successful candidates to become outer sect disciples of the Cloud Sword Sect will be announced now."</p><p></p><p>"Gong Sunyi, Chen Bailai, He Xiusu Zhi, Lin Danlang..."</p><p></p><p>"Those whose names are called, remain. The rest, leave the Cloud Sword Sect's outer sect."</p><p></p><p>Su Qingyi didn't hear his name called and followed the crowd out of the outer sect, full of frustration and despair, not even noticing that Su Yu seemed dazed, unlike someone who had been eliminated.</p><p></p><p>Several elders from the Su Family, including the family master Su Peng, Su Zhi's father, were waiting outside.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning that Su Zhi had successfully become an outer sect disciple of the Cloud Sword Sect, Su Peng and the other Su Family elders were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The sturdy and robust middle-aged man in a blue robe, Su Peng, exclaimed excitedly while looking at the Cloud Sword Sect's mountain gate, "Good, good! Little Zhi has joined the Cloud Sword Sect, so our Su Family now has hope."</p><p></p><p>After his excitement subsided, Su Peng noticed Su Yu's dazed expression and Su Qingyi's dejected look. He consoled them, "You two need not be disheartened. Although not being able to join the Cloud Sword Sect is indeed a great pity, stay in the family and cultivate diligently. Your future achievements may not necessarily be inferior."</p><p></p><p>"You should know that when the Venerable Bai Yue of Bai Yue Immortal City in Great Moon Prefecture was young, he also wanted to join the Great Moon Palace but was rejected due to having only a lower-grade spirit root. He could only become a wandering cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"But now, the Bai Yue Immortal City founded by Venerable Bai Yue has become one of the top immortal cities in Great Moon Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>"You two stay in the family and cultivate well. Your starting point is even higher than Venerable Bai Yue's."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the story of Venerable Bai Yue, Su Qingyi's spirit visibly lifted, his eyes regaining a glimmer of light after being encouraged by the family master.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Bai Yue had only a lower-grade spirit root, yet he could establish the Bai Yue Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>As for him, Su Qingyi, with a middle-grade spirit root, his future achievements would definitely not be inferior to Venerable Bai Yue's.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Су Юй didn't feel much, but looking at everything in front of him, he still felt a bit dreamy. How could the world change after playing games all night and falling asleep? </p><p></p><p>The name Bai Yue Zhenren sounded a bit familiar, like it was the name of a minor magic boss in the early stages of the game he played.</p><p></p><p>In a daze and confusion, Su Yu followed Su Peng and several other elders of the family back to Jiangcheng.</p><p></p><p>On the way.</p><p></p><p>They also ran into people from the Lin family, another cultivating family from Jiangcheng.  </p><p></p><p>This time, the Lin family also had a member enter the Yunjianzong, but they were almost at the bottom, not as good as Su family's young lady Su Zhi.</p><p></p><p>So the people from the Lin family didn't look too pleased when they saw the Su family.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, let's go!" The leading elder Lin Kui of the Lin family snorted coldly, urging his spirit horse to speed up, not wanting to see the Su family.</p><p></p><p>Jiangcheng was a small city near Yunjianzong with only over a hundred thousand people. It was divided and controlled by the two small cultivating families, the Su family and the Lin family.</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu returned to the Su family. Originally, he was a branch member of the Su family and could only live in the small houses on the outskirts. His parents passed away when he was young, and he was raised by the family, a standard orphan protagonist starting point.</p><p></p><p>However, after he returned, the family cleaned up a courtyard for him in the main residence and assigned a young and beautiful maid to serve him. With his spiritual roots, he could embark on the path of cultivation and become a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Every cultivator was a core member of a cultivating family and the key to the family's prosperity.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's treatment in the Su family would naturally not be poor.</p><p></p><p>After receiving this month's allowance from the head elder, a low-grade spirit stone, and thirty pounds of low-grade spirit rice, Su Yu returned to his courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Low-grade five spiritual roots." Su Yu sat cross-legged and pondered. He had a balanced physique with roots in all five elements.  </p><p></p><p>This balanced physique was not that common, but low-grade spiritual roots in all five elements were useless.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, he cultivated the Su family's cultivation method, the Willow Green Wood Mantra, a wood attribute technique that could reach the ninth level of the Refining Qi realm at most.</p><p></p><p>He had just started cultivating and was at the first level of the Refining Qi realm.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, this technique wasn't bad.</p><p></p><p>It was not easy for ordinary cultivators to have techniques that could reach the third or sixth level of the Refining Qi realm.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he was picky about what technique to cultivate; he simply didn't have any other options.</p><p></p><p>But when he focused his mind, the lines of text that appeared before him left him puzzled and doubtful.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Su Yu.]</p><p>[Cultivation: First Level of Refining Qi Realm.]</p><p>[Lifespan: 16/98.]</p><p>[Technique: Willow Green Wood Mantra (First Level, Proficiency 1.6%).]</p><p>[Spells: Wood Vine Technique (Proficiency 3.4%), Spirit Nurturing Technique (Proficiency 6.5%).]</p><p></p><p>It was a very basic interface.</p><p></p><p>Just looking at this interface gave Su Yu a sense of unreality, and he looked dazed: "Did I really transmigrate, or did I enter a game?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, Su Yu said to the maid who was cleaning the courtyard while secretly glancing at him, "Lingdong, come here for a moment."</p><p></p><p>Bai Lingdong's pretty face immediately turned red, and she hurried over with her head lowered, saying, "Young Master Yu, that hurts."</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Bai Lingdong cried out in pain, her eyes wide open as she covered her face with both hands, her eyes brimming with tears as she looked aggrieved at Su Yu, not understanding why he had pinched her cheeks with both hands.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's expression didn't change, and his heart didn't skip a beat. He withdrew his hands that had pinched the maid's cheeks and said, "If you want to look, just look directly. No need to sneak glances."</p><p></p><p>Bai Lingdong's face immediately turned bright red, and she lowered her head, too shy to look at Su Yu, feeling that her secret had been exposed and embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>However, she didn't notice Su Yu's pensive expression.</p><p></p><p>Pain?</p><p></p><p>Do NPCs feel pain? He tested it, and they do, Su Yu thought to himself: "Bai Yue Zhenren was indeed a minor boss in that game, but what is Yunjianzong? There was no Yunjianzong in that game, and the place where Bai Yue Zhenren was located wasn't called Dayuezong either."</p><p></p><p>So, was it just a coincidence?</p><p></p><p>Not a game world?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 42</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi entered the Cloud Sword Sect, with the resource advantage of the Cloud Sword Sect. Even the foundation-building pills used for building the foundation could be exchanged from the sect. </p><p></p><p>However, it was a pity that these sect forces strictly controlled resources and could not transfer the sect's resources to people outside the sect.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Not far from the Eight Demon Ridge, in a manor, several demon cultivators were brewing tea around a stove. Several beautiful village girls were captured by them to serve as maids, trembling and pale as they attended to the few men.</p><p></p><p>"The rumored opportunity ground still hasn't been found after all this time!"</p><p></p><p>"Boss, this matter can't be rushed. Even the Nine Soul Demon Palace couldn't find it before they perished. We...probably have to take it slow and wait patiently."  </p><p></p><p>"Hmph, time waits for no one. Now it's not just the Cloud Sword Sect watching this place, major forces like the Worship Moon Immortal City and Danyang Valley have also appeared."</p><p></p><p>"Currently they haven't taken action, but once that place is discovered, forces like the Cloud Sword Sect definitely won't let us off."</p><p></p><p>"It's still okay actually. The Cloud Sword Sect's power has been declining year after year. Their Realized Men have grown old without any successors. Maybe in another twenty or thirty years, if no new Realized Men appear, the Cloud Sword Sect will be in danger!"</p><p></p><p>"So the Cloud Sword Sect doesn't dare act too arrogantly or make too much noise. As for the other forces, they're far away from here and can't reach us. We still have a chance."</p><p></p><p>The group brewed tea around the stove until night before dispersing.</p><p></p><p>A ninth level of Qi Refinement cultivator brought an eighth level along as they left the manor heading towards the Eight Demon Ridge. He had built an underground lair outside the ridge. As long as he was careful, safety wouldn't be an issue.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't as blatant as that guy in the manor who seized a wealthy merchant's estate to hide among mortals, thinking he could remain undetected.</p><p></p><p>However, if he made one careless mistake and a powerful orthodox cultivator passed by, that guy would undoubtedly die.</p><p></p><p>"But in a few more days, I'll have to call him over to increase our chances. That Chen family's spirit mine transports ore out every month. Taking it over once would give us enough gains to lie low for another year."</p><p></p><p>The ninth level demon cultivator pondered secretly. Just as he passed over a hill, suddenly mist rose and twelve cloud dragons roared, occupying all directions. Controlling the mist into a barrier, they formed an entrapment array, trapping the ninth level demon cultivator and his subordinate brother.</p><p></p><p>The demon cultivator's face changed drastically: "A top-grade first level Cloud Dragon Array? An inner disciple of the Cloud Sword Sect?!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill our way out!"</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, the demon cultivator chose to break out and escape the entrapment.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he summoned his demonic artifact and threw out two top-grade first level talisman specifically for breaking arrays to shatter the Cloud Dragon Array, a black ominous figure suddenly killed out from the dark mist!</p><p></p><p>The two talisman exploded on this figure, only causing it to pause slightly, without leaving a single mark.</p><p></p><p>"Shua!!!"  </p><p></p><p>"Boom!!!"</p><p></p><p>The ninth level demon cultivator turned deathly pale. Controlling his artifact to clash head-on with the ominous figure, his artifact was swatted away, the demonic power dissipating and dimming.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!!"</p><p></p><p>After batting away the demonic artifact, the puppet beast figure didn't stop, swiping a claw towards the ninth level demon cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The demon cultivator fought with all his power, clashing head-on with the puppet beast. In the hurry, he fell at a disadvantage, getting blasted away and smashing into the Cloud Dragon Array barrier behind.</p><p></p><p>"Ungh!" The demon cultivator grunted, blood seeping from the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the puppet beast that had suddenly attacked - completely black like a mirage, yet over a zhang tall and exuding more oppressive might than demonic beasts of the same level.</p><p></p><p>The demon cultivator cried out in alarm: "A top-grade first level peak puppet beast!!!"</p><p></p><p>It's over!</p><p></p><p>Besides people from the Cloud Sword Sect, there was even such a puppet beast here, plus the entrapment array. With the array-breaking talismans gone, what could they do?</p><p></p><p>Shua!</p><p></p><p>The puppet beast attacked again. The two demon cultivators joined forces but still...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>She was completely suppressed by the puppet beast. The attacks of the two cultivators fell harmlessly on the puppet beast, but one swipe from the puppet beast could injure or even kill them. </p><p></p><p>"Swish!"</p><p></p><p>In the moment when the two cultivators were desperately joining forces to resist the puppet beast, a flying sword suddenly came killing out.</p><p></p><p>At the same time. </p><p></p><p>The puppet beast suddenly pounced, swiping one of the cultivators at the 8th layer of Qi Refining realm, sending him flying away.</p><p></p><p>"Puff!" While still in mid-air, the flying sword instantly pierced through his head. That cultivator's eyes bulged out, blood gushing from his mouth, dead with eyes wide open.</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi struck, cooperating with the puppet beast to instantly kill that 8th layer Qi Refining cultivator. </p><p></p><p>Afterwards, she joined forces with the puppet beast again, easily killing the remaining 9th layer Qi Refining cultivator.</p><p></p><p>When the Cloud Dragon Formation dissipated, Chen Sisi, responsible for controlling it, had a look of astonishment. The puppet beast that Su Yu brought out was too powerful and ferocious!</p><p></p><p>A 9th layer Qi Refining cultivator controlling a mid-grade magic treasure was actually suppressed by the ferocious fighting style of the puppet beast!</p><p></p><p>It can be said that such a puppet beast is hundreds or thousands times better than the so-called first-grade top-tier talismans and formations! In ordinary cultivating clans, it could even protect them for thousands of years, as long as there are spirit stones to power the puppet beast, since the puppet beast has no lifespan limit!</p><p></p><p>"Was this puppet beast refined by Brother Su Yu himself, or did the Su Family purchase it...?" Chen Sisi pondered. If he refined it himself, then besides his slightly lacking cultivation talent, his other talents were simply monstrous.</p><p></p><p>She did not know that Su Yu had also cultivated the Puppeteer path.</p><p></p><p>Not far away.</p><p></p><p>Su Qing Yi, who did not need to take action, had a slightly changing expression. The ferocity of the puppet beast also shocked him, adding a hint of distortion to his face.</p><p></p><p>"Su Yu...with your poor cultivation talent, how did you end up better off than me!" Su Qing Yi's face looked ugly, his thoughts in his mind becoming more and more extreme.</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi collected the heads of the two cultivators, as well as their magic treasures, spatial pouches and other spoils.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>"We'll go to that manor next and slaughter the remaining cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>The successful ambush greatly boosted Su Zhi's confidence, her face full of joy. The puppet beast that her cousin Su Yu brought out had shockingly powerful strength that exceeded her imagination.</p><p></p><p>Even within Cloud Sword Sect, there were no first-grade top-tier puppet beasts this powerful available for exchange.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the puppet beast made her very pleasantly surprised and filled with an inexplicable sense of bliss.</p><p></p><p>Having cousin Su Yu and the family as her backing, she felt so blessed.</p><p></p><p>Not long after.</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi's trio arrived at that manor and directly killed their way in.</p><p></p><p>Besides one 9th layer Qi Refining cultivator, there were also five 8th layer or below Qi Refining cultivators here, a small cultivator den.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, calm was restored to the manor. Even though the cultivators had laid down magic formations,</p><p></p><p>they only lasted half an hour before the formations were smashed apart by the puppet beast's claws. One by one, the cultivators' heads rolled under the joint efforts of the puppet beast and Su Zhi's group. The manor returned to tranquility.  </p><p></p><p>Having over-accomplished the mission, Su Zhi happily returned, gave the puppet beast back to Su Yu, and went back to her sect to exchange for Foundation Establishment pills.</p><p></p><p>Next, Su Zhi would seclude herself to prepare for breaking through to the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu received a letter from Su Zhi: "Dear little brother Yu, I have successfully broken through to the Foundation Establishment realm. Next I will continue secluding myself for a period of time. When I emerge, I must repay you handsomely for your help, hehe, look forward to it."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this letter, Su Yu felt very happy. The Su Family had another person break through to the Foundation Establishment realm!</p><p></p><p>With everything prospering, his cultivation in this town would have even more security assurances.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he continued to ponder over his puppet beasts.</p><p></p><p>"Can these two types of puppet beasts combine their strengths and fuse into an even more powerful puppet beast?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

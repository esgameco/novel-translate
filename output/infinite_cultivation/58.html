        <h1>Chapter 58</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Although her looks were not outstanding, at most only six or seven out of ten. </p><p></p><p>That middle-aged woman had a cultivator-disciple relationship with one of them. The remaining man, with a burly figure, a rough and intimidating appearance, and a face full of beard, stood up, looked at Wu Yugangand grinned, "What's the problem?"</p><p></p><p>"When we come back, I'll accompany Daoist friend Wu to cause him trouble."</p><p></p><p>"A mere outer sect cultivator at the eighth level of Qi Refinement dares to offend Daoist friend Wu, he's courting death."</p><p></p><p>Ferocious rays flashed in this man's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged woman laughed lightly, "Perhaps he knew he offended Daoist friend Wu, so he's hiding in the city and doesn't dare to go out."</p><p></p><p>"After all, Daoist friend Wu is a first-grade senior talisman master of the True Palace, and his cultivation has reached the ninth level of Qi Refinement."</p><p></p><p>"He's just a scattered cultivator, how dare he provoke Daoist friend Wu?"</p><p></p><p>Such flattery and adulation made Wu Yugang's expression much better.</p><p></p><p>Wu Yugang gave a cold laugh, "Sooner or later, I will let him know the consequences of offending a talisman master!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to the Yuanyang Wilderness Ridge."</p><p></p><p>The four of them then left the restaurant, rode spirit horses, and went out of Baiyue Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>However, none of the four noticed that behind them, there was a figure following them from afar, like an illusion.</p><p></p><p>The Yuanyang Wilderness Ridge was a demonic beast wilderness within the territory of Baiyue Immortal City, filled with countless demonic beasts. It was rumored that even demon tribes were hiding there, making it extremely dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Under Wu Yugang's lead, it took the four of them nearly two days of traveling before they arrived outside the Yuanyang Wilderness Ridge and saw the deep mountains and ancient forests ahead.</p><p></p><p>Without the slightest hesitation, the four of them charged straight in.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>A stealthy figure arrived silently. The spirit puppet transformed into a shadow panther and followed them from a distance.</p><p></p><p>The undergrowth in the forest was dense, with demonic beasts and venomous insects hiding everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Wu Yugang's group moved very slowly, with each step potentially bringing unknown dangers.</p><p></p><p>So after entering the Yuanyang Wilderness Ridge, the four of them used their spiritual power to create a barrier around their bodies. This way, even if there were venomous insects or demonic beasts, they could temporarily withstand them.</p><p></p><p>The downside was that they had to stop and rest every so often to recover their spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>The spirit puppet hid in the dense undergrowth, watching those four prey from afar, unhurried.</p><p></p><p>"It's convenient for the beast form to move in this demonic beast wilderness, while the human form can walk outside." Su Yu felt the experience of the spirit puppet's shadow panther form moving through the dense forest and found it very comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his mind was unprecedentedly relaxed, as if he had returned to his 'own' den.</p><p></p><p>The spirit puppet entered the Yuanyang Wilderness Ridge, and he wasn't worried at all.</p><p></p><p>It was completely different from the experience when his main body entered the dense forest while hunting the Zuo Mountain Eagle with Su Zhizhi.</p><p></p><p>Two days later.</p><p></p><p>When Su Yu saw Wu Yugang's group stop in front of a mountain valley, he made a mental note and took out a bottle of Confusion Liquid from his cosmic bag, preparing to apply it to the shadow panther's claws before taking action.</p><p></p><p>"Confusion Liquid, a second-grade low-rank Freezing Talisman, a Fire Dragon Talisman, and two second-grade early-stage Beast Subjugation Talismans... should be stable?"</p><p></p><p>In front of the mountain valley, Wu Yugang's group carefully explored the surroundings before returning here.</p><p></p><p>Wu Yugang transmitted his voice in a low tone, "There's a cold pond inside, with a first-grade top-tier demonic beast, the Ice Scale Serpent, guarding a Cold Heart Lotus."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged woman transmitted, "I vaguely sensed the aura of a first-grade late-stage demonic bird in the east, probably trying to seize the Cold Heart Lotus from the Ice Scale Serpent."</p><p></p><p>Her taciturn cultivator companion transmitted, "There are three first-grade mid-stage lesser demonic beasts in the west, nothing to worry about."</p><p></p><p>The remaining rough-looking, intimidating man transmitted, "In the north, there's a first-grade top-tier demonic wolf, probably also eyeing that Cold Heart Lotus."</p><p></p><p>Wu Yugang frowned slightly and transmitted, "I think the Cold Heart Lotus will mature in a day or half a day at most. By then, those demonic beasts will definitely fight for it."</p><p></p><p>"Here's the plan: Old Guo and I will intercept the Ice Scale Serpent..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The demonic snake tried to seize the Ice Heart Lotus, while Old Yao and his younger brother and sister blocked the other demonic beasts. "After snatching the Ice Heart Lotus, immediately retreat from the Yuanyang Wilderness."</p><p></p><p>"Got it." </p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>The three ladies responded upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Half a day passed. </p><p></p><p>As night approached, when the first rays of moonlight fell on the icy pond at the bottom of the valley, illuminating a translucent jade lotus that shone like ice jade, the Ice Heart Lotus that had been waiting to bloom finally blossomed, releasing a chilling air.</p><p></p><p>"Hum!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the valley was illuminated by a white light in the dark night.</p><p></p><p>"Huhuhu!!!" From all directions, countless spiritual energies of heaven and earth stirred abnormally, gathering towards the Ice Heart Lotus by the icy pond and being devoured by it.</p><p></p><p>Nearby, a demonic snake over four zhang long that had been keeping watch had its eyes shining brightly. An unusual fragrance of the mature Ice Heart Lotus bloomed, causing the ice-scaled demonic snake's blood to surge as it could no longer hold back from opening its bloody maw to swallow the Ice Heart Lotus whole.</p><p></p><p>The Ice Heart Lotus was an ice-attribute spirit medicine, perfectly suited for the snake to break through to the early second-grade demonic beast realm.</p><p></p><p>As long as it could refine the medicinal power of the Ice Heart Lotus, its chances of successfully breaking through would be at least fifty percent!</p><p></p><p>However, just as the ice-scaled demonic snake's bloody maw was about to close, a shrill cry of a demonic bird resounded from the sky.</p><p></p><p>A black shadow flashed from the forest behind, and a sharp claw struck heavily on the ice-scaled demonic snake's scaly armor.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!!!"</p><p></p><p>The ice-scaled demonic snake was knocked askew by this strike, its head slamming into the icy pond.</p><p></p><p>And just as the black shadow was about to devour the Ice Heart Lotus, the demonic bird in the sky had already arrived, its formidable aura causing the demonic wolf to give up on the Ice Heart Lotus. With an angry howl resounding through the dense forest, it dodged away reluctantly.</p><p></p><p>Against this demonic bird, whether it was the ice-scaled demonic snake or the wolf, they would both be at a disadvantage in a direct confrontation.</p><p></p><p>The demonic wolf retreated, and the demonic bird's sharp claws reached directly for the Ice Heart Lotus.</p><p></p><p>But at that moment.</p><p></p><p>"Hum!!!"</p><p></p><p>Three ice talisman shot out in succession, instantly burning and releasing a powerful chilling aura, freezing everything.</p><p></p><p>Under the freezing power of the three high-grade first-level ice talismans, the demonic bird's body surface was covered in a layer of ice.</p><p></p><p>The chilling aura invaded the demonic bird's body, causing its movements to slow down instantly.</p><p></p><p>"Attack!" </p><p></p><p>Wu Gongluan shouted loudly, and the four of them rushed to the edge of the icy pond. Wu Gongluan was responsible for retrieving the Ice Heart Lotus, while the burly man blocked the ice-scaled demonic snake.</p><p></p><p>The married couple were tasked with intercepting the demonic bird, the demonic wolf, and other minor demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>With the help of the talismans, the demonic bird was instantly blasted away by the married couple, slamming into the mountain wall behind with a shrill cry, severely injured.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the human cultivators appear, the demonic wolf howled angrily and charged forward.</p><p></p><p>But against the married couple, who were at the ninth layer of the Qi Refining realm, the demonic wolf was simply outmatched and unable to break through their interception.</p><p></p><p>The ice-scaled demonic snake emerged again from the icy pond, roaring furiously. But in the next moment, a heavy magic weapon, a great axe, was swung down from the sky.</p><p></p><p>The ice-scaled demonic snake spewed a chilling aura, freezing the great axe.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Spiritual power and demonic power clashed violently, shattering the ice. Although the ice-scaled demonic snake managed to block the magic weapon, it was once again blasted into the icy pond.</p><p></p><p>Wu Gongluan had just retrieved the Ice Heart Lotus, carefully placing it in a jade box, which he then put into a jade case with a restrictive talisman and stored in his spatial bag.</p><p></p><p>Wu Gongluan was overjoyed, shouting repeatedly, "Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Swoosh swoosh swoosh!</p><p></p><p>The four of them had no desire to linger in battle. Having snatched the Ice Heart Lotus, they fled. Before the demonic bird, wolf, ice-scaled snake and other demonic beasts could react, they had already rushed out of the valley.</p><p></p><p>However, at that moment, an ice-blue talisman and a crimson-red talisman flew out from the bushes ahead, heading straight for them.</p><p></p><p>Wu Gongluan and the other three: "?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

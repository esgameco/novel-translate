        <h1>Chapter 70</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The pill refining task in the Main Palace had been completed over a month ago. </p><p></p><p>So afterSu Yu equipped the Pill Pavilion with ample stock of second-grade low-rank commonly used pills, he returned to the courtyard house.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the essential talismans, Su Yu currently had four top-grade mid-tier magical artifacts on him. Among them was a protective magic robe that could enlarge, shrink and change its appearance. It also had a defensive array that could block one strike from a Foundation Establishment cultivator of the first level. </p><p></p><p>There was also a top-grade mid-tier magic artifact called the Golden Bell Cover, whose defensive ability should be able to withstand a Foundation Establishment cultivator of the first level for a short moment.</p><p></p><p>Another top-grade mid-tier magic artifact was a flying sword, with no other special features except for its speed. In critical moments, it could allow for an extremely fast sword escape from danger.</p><p></p><p>The last top-grade mid-tier magic artifact was the Trap Dragon Lock, which could trap enemies for a brief moment to buy time for escape in critical situations.</p><p></p><p>After inspecting the magical artifacts, talismans and pill stock, as well as some second-grade psychedelic drugs and poisons he had prepared, Su Yu felt much more at ease looking at all these items.</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu, Yu Ke'er, along with Yu Qinqing, who was the martial sister of Chen Sisi, left Bai Yue Immortal City together. They did not ride spirit horses, but instead alternated between flying demonic black-scaled eagles and twin-headed blood eagles to fly towards the Cloud Sword Sect's territory where the Su Family resided.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, some minor cultivators sensed the presence of the demonic beasts and changed their expressions.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the second-grade demonic beasts instilled fear in them.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately.</p><p></p><p>They soon realized there were people riding on the backs of the demonic birds, which slightly put them at ease, though they were greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Those are second-grade flying demonic beasts! There are people on them!"</p><p></p><p>"Whew, which senior cultivator is traveling? The aura of those demonic birds is terrifying. To have such demonic birds as flying mounts, it must be a great cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm so envious, when will we be able to have such demonic beasts as mounts?"</p><p></p><p>Throughout the journey on the flying demonic beasts leaving the Bai Yue Immortal City region and entering the Cloud Sword Sect's territory, Su Yu and the other two did not encounter any accidents.</p><p></p><p>And this speed was much faster than when Su Yu previously rode a spirit horse to Bai Yue Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, riding demonic beasts in the air was generally safer than riding spirit horses under normal circumstances.</p><p></p><p>In less than ten days.</p><p></p><p>The Cang Mountains of Jiang City appeared before the trio's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The winding Cang Mountains stretched endlessly, with boundless mist swirling among the valleys, faintly revealing towering ancient trees piercing through the clouds.</p><p></p><p>At the center of the Cang Mountains, a mountain protection array shielded the land.</p><p></p><p>At the entrance.</p><p></p><p>Two young Su Family cultivators were on guard duty. At this moment, sensing a terrifying demonic aura descending, the two immediately turned pale and looked up.</p><p></p><p>"Screech!"</p><p></p><p>A deafening shriek echoed through the mountains.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a black shadow was rapidly descending. In the blink of an eye, the shadow transformed into a colossal demonic bird blocking out the sky, its terrifying second-grade demonic aura nearly causing the two guards to faint from fright.</p><p></p><p>The two cried out in trembling voices, their legs going soft: "Oh no—"</p><p></p><p>At this time.</p><p></p><p>A muffled voice came from within the Cang Mountains, it was the voice of Su Bin: "I don't know which fellow daoist is descending upon my Cang Mountain Su Family residence? Please wait a moment and have this demonic mount restrain its might a bit."</p><p></p><p>On the back of the twin-headed blood eagle, Su Yu revealed a hint of a mischievous smile.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his expression, Yu Ke'er covered her mouth and smiled lightly, feeling very comfortable as she softly said: "Aren't you afraid your family elders will give you a beating?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu chuckled: "This is your demonic mount, if anyone gets beaten, it will be you."</p><p></p><p>Yu Ke'er glared at him, gritting her teeth: "That's because you told me to do this, don't try to pass the blame."</p><p></p><p>This guy, clearly indulging his own mischievous whims like a child.</p><p></p><p>But now he's trying to deny responsibility, how vexing.</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Yu Ke'er snorted and had the twin-headed blood eagle restrain its demonic aura before descending at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>As Su Yu got off the twin-headed blood eagle's back, the two young Su Family cultivator guards who had been terrified by the beast, their faces pale and trembling, widened their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The two youngsters were both shocked and aggrieved: "Fifth Elder?"</p><p></p><p>They almost cried.</p><p></p><p>Fifth Elder?</p><p>You didn't have to scare us like that, they nearly fainted on the spot.</p><p></p><p>However, they soon became excited again.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Elder rode back on a second-grade demonic mount!</p><p></p><p>This news quickly spread throughout the entire Cang Mountain, and all Su Family members learned of it, feeling invigorated and excited without exception.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>A second-tier beast tamer!</p><p></p><p>This existence is comparable to the Foundation Establishment realm. </p><p></p><p>With this second-tier beast tamer, the Su family's strength has increased again, their foundation of power rising another notch.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment in the main hall of the family compound, Su Bin, Su Jingbang, Su Peng, Su Yun, Su Chang, and Su Ruosu all looked at Su Yu with helpless expressions. This guy came back making such a huge commotion. </p><p></p><p>He gave them all a fright, nearly causing heart attacks.</p><p></p><p>"You brat."</p><p></p><p>Su Bin shook his head helplessly at Su Yu, then his gaze fell on Yu Zher and Yu Qingqing, surprised in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Two dao companions? It can't be, right?</p><p></p><p>Su Yu then introduced everyone, and Su Bin and the others looked at Yu Zher in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Yu Qingqing was an inner disciple of the Cloud Sword Sect, Chen Sisi's martial sister, so her coming to pay respects was understandable.</p><p></p><p>But the eldest young lady of the legitimate branch of the Yu family—</p><p></p><p>Following their Fifth Elder to pay respects to Chen Sisi?</p><p></p><p>"You know where the cemetery is, let's disperse." Su Bin and the others left with smiles, but as soon as they were out of the main hall, they immediately started whispering to each other, their voices not soft at all, a bunch of shameless old folks.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu looked at Yu Zher helplessly: "Don't take them seriously, they're just talking nonsense."</p><p></p><p>A little while later, at the cemetery in the back mountain.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu, Yu Zher, and Yu Qingqing set out offerings for Chen Sisi, looking at her tombstone, the three of them seemed a bit dazed as Su Yu recalled the past.</p><p></p><p>It was undeniable that the first time he saw Chen Sisi back then, she was indeed quite stunning and charming - young, beautiful, sexy, and alluring, with a great figure and talent.</p><p></p><p>But Su Yu never really had any thoughts about her.</p><p></p><p>And now, the old friend was gone.</p><p></p><p>"My abilities are limited, I can only secretly watch over and help a little bit. If it exceeds my capabilities..." Su Yu sighed inwardly, thinking to himself: "Then I can only wait until I have the ability to kill the other party with a slap of my hand before avenging you and the Chen family."</p><p></p><p>If he didn't have the ability, he could only apologize.</p><p></p><p>He would strive to outlive the other party, and after they died, he would go dance on their grave to avenge and vent for them.</p><p></p><p>He poured out a jar of fine spirit wine.</p><p></p><p>A toast to an old friend from the past.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Su Yu and the two ladies bid farewell and left.</p><p></p><p>That evening.</p><p></p><p>The Su family hosted a banquet to entertain Yu Zher and Yu Qingqing. At the banquet, Su Yu asked about the situation in the Eight Demons Ridge, as well as the Cloud Sword Sect, Chen family, the puppet master Jiang family, the Guanlan Mountain Huang family, and others.</p><p></p><p>Su Bin was most concerned about these matters and knew the most, saying: "The Eight Demons Ridge has become a mess, even cultivators at the Foundation Establishment realm are not safe there. Major powers like the Cloud Sword Sect, Baimoon Immortal City, Kaiyangong, and Great Moon Palace have all sent Pseudo-Dan experts, it's a jumbled mix of fish and dragons."</p><p></p><p>"There are even experts from demonic cultivator forces outside of the Great Moon Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>"The Chen family and our Su family are still doing okay, everything is as usual. In fact, because of the Eight Demons Ridge incident drawing the attention of the Huang and Jiang families, our days have become a bit easier."</p><p></p><p>"As for what changes will occur after the Eight Demons Ridge matter concludes, who knows?"</p><p></p><p>"I do hope the Jiang and Huang families suffer losses there, severe losses even, heh heh."</p><p></p><p>Su Bin poured himself a cup of spirit wine, squinting his eyes and chuckling. When mentioning the Jiang and Huang families, a hint of cold light flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Demonic cultivators from outside the Great Moon Prefecture have even come? </p><p></p><p>Terrifying!</p><p>Dangerous!</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's heart tightened. In that case, he couldn't linger here for too long and had to quickly return to Baimoon Immortal City. It was better to run first.</p><p></p><p>As for the Chen family's matters, he could only secretly watch over them a little and ask Fifth Elder Su Bin to keep an eye on the Chen family, informing him if anything happened.</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare to openly support the Chen family.</p><p></p><p>Because doing so would clearly tell the Cloud Sword Sect that he had obtained something good from Chen Sisi's hands.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why would he treat the Chen family so well?</p><p></p><p>Then connect that to Chen Sisi having gone to the Golden Jade Immortal Gate ruins - it would be a mess.</p><p></p><p>No one was a fool.</p><p></p><p>He himself was still just a small fry, how could he have such great abilities?</p><p></p><p>This matter should wait until after the Eight Demons Ridge Golden Jade Immortal Gate ruins incident was resolved.</p><p></p><p>The next morning at dawn, Su Yu left behind some second-grade low-rank talisman papers and pills for his family clan. Then he hurriedly departed Cangshan Mountain with Yu Zher and Yu Qingqing, returning to Baimoon Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

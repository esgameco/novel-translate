        <h1>Chapter 37</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>A few days after Suqizhi returned to her sect, she came to the Cloud Mountain Town again, accompanied by five inner disciples of the Cloud Sword Sect. Two of them were at the eighth level of Qi Refining, and three were at the ninth level of Qi Refining. Among them, there was a woman wearing a white silk face veil whose aura gave Suyu a creepy feeling. </p><p></p><p>Very strong!</p><p></p><p>Although they were all at the ninth level of Qi Refining, if the Golden Falcon Ghost encountered this woman, he would probably be killed by her at first sight.</p><p></p><p>Suqizhi brought the five people to meet Suyu and introduced them one by one.</p><p></p><p>"This is Junior Sister Yu Qianqing." A girl with a slightly chubby baby face that would make people blush and shyly lower their heads when their gaze fell on her.</p><p></p><p>After a simple introduction, Suqizhi transmitted her voice: "Junior Sister Yu is a disciple of the Pill Pavilion, with exceptional talent in pill refining. Of course, she's a bit inferior to you, Xiao Yu. She's currently a first-grade middle-rank pill refiner and a registered disciple of the Elder of the Pill Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>"I personally think Junior Sister Yu has a good temperament and talent, and she's also a pill refiner, which suits you well, right? Hehe."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Suqizhi introduced three senior martial brothers without further voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it was the woman wearing the white silk face veil. Suqizhi introduced her, "This is Senior Sister Luo Qianyu. Senior Sister Luo is a direct disciple of the Great Elder."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Suyu looked at the woman in astonishment. A direct disciple of the Great Elder of the Cloud Sword Sect?</p><p></p><p>Why did Suqizhi bring such a person to meet him?</p><p></p><p>Suqizhi introduced Suyu, saying, "This is my junior martial brother Suyu. Although his cultivation level is not high yet, he is a first-grade top-rank pill refiner."</p><p></p><p>The previously shy Yu Manli looked at Suyu with some curiosity and respect, saying, "I've heard about you from Senior Sister Su."</p><p></p><p>"How do you practice pill refining? I find it very difficult. You need to consider the medicinal properties, quantities, and fire control. It's so complicated and difficult."</p><p></p><p>"I can't even refine first-grade middle-rank pills well. I don't know when I'll be able to reach the level of a first-grade top-rank pill refiner."</p><p></p><p>"Well..." Suyu smiled bitterly and shook his head, "I can barely refine pills. I'm not really a first-grade top-rank pill refiner, far inferior to the elite disciples of the Cloud Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>Yu Manli rolled her eyes at Suyu and said, "Your words are so obvious."</p><p></p><p>Suyu smiled and didn't say anything else.</p><p></p><p>The other four from the Cloud Sword Sect didn't speak either. Although the three men didn't look up to Suyu's mere fifth level of Qi Refining, after learning that he was a first-grade top-rank pill refiner, their gazes towards him held more respect! They didn't dare to look down on him anymore!</p><p></p><p>Yu Manli was studying pill refining under the guidance of the Elder of the Pill Pavilion in the Cloud Sword Sect, and she had only managed to become a first-grade middle-rank pill refiner.</p><p></p><p>Yet this person, with just the fifth level of Qi Refining in a small town, had become a first-grade top-rank pill refiner!</p><p></p><p>What monstrous talent in pill refining did he possess to achieve this?</p><p></p><p>What if they needed to seek his help in the future?</p><p></p><p>Even Luo Qianyu, the direct disciple of the Great Elder of the Cloud Sword Sect, looked at Suyu with a hint of surprise. Pill refining still had some requirements for cultivation level. At such a young age, it was not easy to become a first-grade top-rank pill refiner, let alone achieving it with just the fifth level of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>This was a monstrous young pill refiner!</p><p></p><p>Suqizhi then said, "Xiao Yu, I've already reported the incident with the Golden Falcon Ghost to the sect. The Second Elder said he doesn't intend to investigate the matter further. So I thought I'd go and investigate it with these senior and junior martial brothers and sisters."</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>Suyu interrupted, "I won't go. With my fifth level of Qi Refining, I'll only hold you back there, so I won't go."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Luo Qianyu said, "You can come along as well. Even at the Foundation</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"If you don't go out of the boundary, then your safety will still be guaranteed."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu shook her head and smiled, "Thank you for your kindness, but I still won't go."</p><p></p><p>Luo Qianyu nodded and said, "Since that's the case...I want to trade something for the map in your hands and that magic formation flag."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Luo Qianyu waved her hand, and a furnace talisman appeared in her palm. </p><p></p><p>The furnace was entirely green and glistening, like a treasure carved from jade stone.</p><p></p><p>"This is a top-tier mid-grade talisman furnace for pill refinement called the Emerald Furnace. If you're willing, I'll trade this for the formation flag, map, and token in your possession," Luo Qianyu said, her eyes clear like gemstones as she looked at Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu was astonished, "A top-tier mid-grade talisman furnace for pill refinement? This is too precious!"</p><p></p><p>Such a talisman was not far from being a top-grade item.</p><p></p><p>It was far more valuable than that incomplete second-tier low-grade magic formation flag.</p><p></p><p>Especially since this was a furnace for pill refinement! Even rarer and more precious!</p><p></p><p>Luo Qianyu smiled faintly, "It's worth it, just the token of an inner disciple of the Nine Souls Demon Palace is worth it."</p><p></p><p>So that was it.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu didn't hesitate and took out those items to trade to Luo Qianyu. He wouldn't touch those things at all, nor would he investigate what secrets lay behind them or what 'adventure' the Golden Vulture Demon had encountered.</p><p></p><p>It was too dangerous. Not knowing anything, there was no telling what he might encounter.</p><p></p><p>Rather than take that risk, it was better to cultivate safely in the market town.</p><p></p><p>With his current resources, as long as he cultivated steadily without incident, reaching the Foundation Establishment realm was almost a certainty.</p><p></p><p>So why bother investigating this?</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>Luo Qianyu glanced at the token, and her eyes immediately narrowed. She nodded slightly to Su Yu in acknowledgment, then waved her hand to collect all the items.</p><p></p><p>The group was about to take their leave when Su Yu gifted Su Zhi a bottle of Mind-Muddling Liquid.</p><p></p><p>After seeing them off, Su Yu felt quite pleased. Once they were out of sight, he looked down at the top-tier mid-grade talisman furnace in his hands and smiled widely.</p><p></p><p>"What a profit!"</p><p></p><p>This furnace was probably better than the one his master Su Yun had.</p><p></p><p>When he told Su Yun about this, Su Yun raised his brows in surprise, "A direct disciple of the Elder of the Cloud Sword Sect? It seems Little Zhi has quite a good relationship in the Cloud Sword Sect. And that inner disciple token from the Nine Souls Demon Palace, perhaps there really is some secret behind it."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, why would the direct disciple of the Elder make a personal move?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yun shook his head and looked at Su Yu, "You did the right thing by not going. We're pill refiners, why take that risk?"</p><p></p><p>"That furnace came at the perfect time. Refine and nurture it well."</p><p></p><p>That furnace could refine second-tier spirit pills.</p><p></p><p>"Got it."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu returned to his room to cultivate diligently.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later, Su Zhi and the others returned and hurriedly came to the Pill Pavilion to briefly share their findings and gains with Su Yu and Su Yun.</p><p></p><p>Then they returned to the sect to seclude themselves in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the next time they met, they would have reached the ninth level of the Qi Condensation realm.</p><p></p><p>Every day, Su Yu cultivated the Greenwood Cycle Technique, the Alligator Demon's One Hundred Eight Body Refinement Techniques, refined pills, drew talismans, and studied the Puppet Master's inheritance during his free time.</p><p></p><p>Half a year passed peacefully and happily this way.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Mountain Market Auction held once every three years was approaching again.</p><p></p><p>That day, a young lady who was something of an acquaintance came to the Su Family's Pill Pavilion again, accompanied by an old woman.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

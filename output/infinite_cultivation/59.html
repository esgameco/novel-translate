        <h1>Chapter 59</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Just as they had snatched the Ice Heart Lotus from the clutches of the demonic beasts like the Ice Scale Serpent, Eagle Beast, and Wolf Demon, it was precisely when Wu Yugang and the other three had their guards down and were least alert, reacting a beat slower. </p><p></p><p>Seeing two talisman papers shooting towards their faces, Wu Yugang and the others were stunned for a moment. By the time they reacted with changed expressions, it was too late.</p><p></p><p>"Hum!"</p><p></p><p>The second-grade low-level Ice Talisman exploded, releasing a chilling ice aura that made Wu Yugang's group's scalps go numb as it swept across the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>Wu Yugang, who was in the front, hadn't even reacted when he instantly turned into a block of solid ice. </p><p></p><p>The burly man behind him turned deathly pale: "A second-grade low-level Ice Talisman!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the chilling ice aura swept over them. The burly man was also covered in a layer of solid ice. The terrifying ice aura invaded his flesh and soul, freezing his body rigid and immobile, as if even his soul had been frozen.</p><p></p><p>As for the husband and wife at the back, they still had some distance as a buffer. Their faces changed drastically as they unleashed a series of spells.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they released several first-grade top-level talisman papers from their reserves. </p><p></p><p>Two offensive talismans attacked the incoming chilling ice aura, while a Lightfoot Talisman enhanced their speed for a rapid retreat, and a defensive talisman shielded their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Even when the ice aura struck the next moment, most of its force was shattered by the two of them. The remaining portion only froze their bodies rigid, slightly hindering their movements, but they could still move.</p><p></p><p>This was much better than Wu Yugang and the burly man, but before the two could retreat far,</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a second-grade low-level Fire Dragon Talisman ignited, and an enormous fire dragon roared out, its raging flames reaching towards the heavens. It instantly crashed into Wu Yugang's group.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!!!"</p><p></p><p>Countless trees in the dense forest collapsed like rotten logs. Huge boulders shattered, and the ground cracked like a spider web, extending in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Wu Yugang's body was directly devoured and melted by the fire dragon, turning into flying ashes without a complete corpse left behind.</p><p></p><p>The burly man fared slightly better, probably having cultivated some body refining techniques. His body didn't explode, but his skin cracked open in numerous places, and his bones, organs, and viscera were all shattered. His corpse turned into a lump of charcoal, blasted out over a mile away by the fire dragon's impact and crashing onto the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhh!"  </p><p>"Puff!"</p><p></p><p>The husband and wife were caught off guard by the second-grade low-level Fire Dragon Talisman's ferocious power and were sent flying with agonizing screams.</p><p></p><p>Blood gushed from their bodies as they coughed up mouthfuls of fresh blood, sustaining severe injuries.</p><p></p><p>Their hearts were filled with shock, fear, resentment, and anger.</p><p></p><p>Who!?  </p><p>Who had ambushed them!?</p><p></p><p>"Run!" The husband growled, gritting his teeth against the excruciating pain and attempting to flee by riding the force that had flung them away.</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, a dark shadow loomed over the two of them from ahead.</p><p></p><p>The husband and wife's eyes widened as they saw a nearly two-zhang (about 6 meters) tall giant ape covered in fiery red fur that seemed to be engulfed in flames.</p><p></p><p>The husband and wife cried out in horror: "A second-grade demonic beast, the Earth Fire Ape!?"</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>The Earth Fire Ape swung its mid-grade magic weapon, the Wolf's Fang Staff, with lightning speed, smashing the husband, who had reached the ninth layer of Qi Refining, into a meat patty with a single strike.</p><p></p><p>His head exploded like a watermelon, and then his body followed suit.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!!"</p><p></p><p>The Wolf's Fang Staff slammed into the ground, sending soil, shattered flesh, and crushed bones flying. The earth shook, and a massive pit was formed where the staff struck.</p><p></p><p>The wife's face turned deathly pale, her mind went blank as she collapsed limply to the ground, staring dazedly at the Earth Fire Ape.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>The Earth Fire Ape swung its arm horizontally, the Wolf's Fang Staff sweeping across the wife. Her robe and Daoist garments were instantly shredded, accompanied by an explosion of flesh as her body was torn into four or five pieces from the waist down.</p><p></p><p>The wife: "..."</p><p></p><p>Behind them.</p><p></p><p>The Wolf Demon and Ice Scale Serpent, who had just caught up, came to an abrupt halt, their eyes widening.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the second-grade early stage demonic beast, the Earth Fire Ape, appear so suddenly, the two top-tier first-grade late stage demonic beasts trembled in fear, dread welling up from their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Howl!"</p><p></p><p>The Wolf Demon whimpered in fear, its tail tucked between its legs, and immediately turned to flee without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The ice-scaled serpent demon was even faster, abandoning its old lair in the cold pond and fleeing in the other direction. </p><p></p><p>The earth fire ape stared at the two small demons, baring its teeth. It pounded its chest with one arm and let out a loud roar: "Roar!!!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, it threw out the wolf's fang club in its hand.</p><p></p><p>The wolf demon that had just turned to flee was instantly smashed in half its body by the club: 'Bang!'  It didn't even let out a wail before it was completely finished.</p><p></p><p>As for the ice-scaled serpent demon that fled in the other direction, the earth fire ape looked over but didn't move.</p><p></p><p>Swish!</p><p></p><p>A black cloud descended from the sky, and a cold light flashed.</p><p></p><p>"Puchi!"</p><p></p><p>The huge head of the ice-scaled serpent demon was instantly separated from its body. The black-scaled eagle grabbed the snake's head with one claw and seized the body of the ice-scaled serpent demon with the other claw. With a flap of its wings, it flew and landed beside the body puppet.</p><p></p><p>Not far from the body puppet, the corpse of the eagle beast was also decapitated, having already been killed by the black-scaled eagle.</p><p></p><p>Thus, not only were Wu Yigong and his three companions annihilated, but even the three late-stage demonic beasts of the first level that spied on the Ice Heart Lotus could not escape.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's body puppet in the form of a dark shadow leopard rushed out and looked at the battlefield that had already ended. It then used its magic power to dispel the mind-muddling liquid it had just applied to its four claws, as it was no longer needed.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, it quickly cleaned up the battlefield. Wu Yigong's interspatial bag was a bit damaged, but the space inside was still intact. </p><p></p><p>The jade case containing the Ice Heart Lotus was right here.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu looked around and could no longer find Wu Yigong's ashes, and couldn't help but shake his head slightly and mutter: "A first-level top-grade talisman master?"</p><p></p><p>"I, a second-level lower-grade talisman master, haven't even spoken yet."</p><p></p><p>The interspatial bags and magic treasures of the burly man and the married couple were quickly taken away by Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>As for the three demonic beasts that were killed, Su Yu stored them in three separate interspatial bags he had summoned.</p><p></p><p>After destroying all traces, Su Yu returned the earth fire ape and black-scaled eagle, the two beast companions, to the beast companion bag, and controlled the dark shadow leopard body puppet to leave.</p><p></p><p>He ran out of the Yuanyang Wilderness in one breath, then transformed into an old man's form, circled around for a few rounds, and stayed in a mountain cave for half a month before quietly returning to Bai Yue Xian City.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yue Xian City.</p><p></p><p>Alley.</p><p></p><p>Courtyard, room inside.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu withdrew his body puppet and took the interspatial bags of Wu Yigong and the others from the body puppet's hands, taking out the contents one by one.</p><p></p><p>The corpses of the three demonic beasts had already been digested by the earth fire ape and black-scaled eagle, leaving only some miscellaneous first-level materials.</p><p></p><p>In Wu Yigong's interspatial bag, besides the jade case containing the Ice Heart Lotus, there were also his cultivation methods, the legacy of a first-level top-grade talisman master.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Wu Yigong left behind two high-grade magic treasures, three low-grade magic treasures, more than thirty first-level talismans, and more than seven hundred low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>These items were worth at least two thousand low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>In the burly man's interspatial bag, what delighted Su Yu was that he had quite a few materials for refining Foundation Establishment Pills.</p><p></p><p>There was even one of the core materials, although it was one of the three types that the Su Family already had, but it was still an unexpected gain.</p><p></p><p>The burly man had a top-grade high-level magic treasure in the form of a great axe, as well as a high-grade magic treasure shield. He hadn't had a chance to use them before being killed by Su Yu's two second-level lower-grade talismans.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have many low-grade spirit stones, only a little more than three hundred.</p><p></p><p>In the interspatial bags of the married couple, Su Yu discovered even more materials for refining Foundation Establishment Pills, including two other types of core materials.</p><p></p><p>With this, not counting the three types of core materials for refining Foundation Establishment Pills that the Su Family already had, Su Yu now had a total of four types.</p><p></p><p>He had gathered enough ordinary materials for one dose.</p><p></p><p>"I'm only missing a pure demonic core and a spiritual fruit," Su Yu murmured in pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>Not counting the magic treasures and other gains, in this operation alone he had obtained more than 1,900 low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Adding that to his own little treasury, he now had more than 7,400.</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully the upcoming auction at the Spirit Palace will yield some gains," Su Yu said expectantly, thinking of the core materials needed for the Dragon Alligator Puppet Beast and the Foundation Establishment Pill - a pure demonic core and a spiritual fruit.</p><p></p><p>He needed those things.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

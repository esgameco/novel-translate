            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>As soon as he returned to the courtyard, Elder Su Bin sent someone to summon him. Su Yu followed that person and came to the Archive Pavilion, where Su Bin was leisurely reading ancient books. </p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Yu, Su Bin put down the book in his hand and looked at him. After sizing him up, he clicked his tongue in admiration and said, "Good boy, it was you who took down Lin Xiu from the Lin family yesterday, wasn't it?"</p><p></p><p>Yesterday's incident happened on the main street, so many people saw Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>The Lin family didn't know who Su Yu was, but the Su family could find out with some investigation.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu pondered and nodded, "It was me, but I didn't strike first. I was just passing by when that guy suddenly attacked me with a water snake spell. I could only fight back in self-defense."</p><p></p><p>Su Bin snorted disdainfully at Su Yu, "Don't play dumb. You fought back in self-defense, yet instantly turned him into a shattered corpse."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu felt helpless. He had only thrown one punch.  It was the other party who was too weak.</p><p></p><p>Before Su Yu could speak, Su Bin waved his hand and took out a bag from his pocket, "Alright, it doesn't matter how you killed him. The important thing is you killed a cultivator from the Lin family, the grandson of the Fourth Elder of the Lin family, to be precise."</p><p></p><p>"This is worth praising. Take this, it's a lower-grade interspatial bag. Although it's only a lower-grade magic treasure, it can still be used. There are also thirty lower-grade spirit stones inside as a reward from our family."</p><p></p><p>"Remember, if you encounter any Lin family cultivators next time, beat them up even if they don't attack first."</p><p></p><p>"If they do attack, then kill them if you can - of course, if you can't win, remember to run fast."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu didn't catch the rest of what Su Bin said. He was staring at the interspatial bag with shining eyes.</p><p></p><p>He was actually being rewarded for this?</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly accepted the interspatial bag and said gratefully, "Thank you, Fifth Granduncle. Thank you, Patriarch and all the Elders."</p><p></p><p>Su Bin waved his hand again and said, "If there's nothing else, then scram."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu shrugged and took his leave.</p><p></p><p>Watching Su Yu's departing back, Su Bin had a contemplative look and muttered, "He's still only at the second level of Qi Condensation realm. Then, has he cultivated some body refining technique?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Su Bin's expression turned astonished as he couldn't help feeling shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be - that body refining technique?"</p><p></p><p>If it really was -</p><p></p><p>Su Bin's eyes shone with increasing delight as he gazed at Su Yu's gradually disappearing back, his gaze deepening with a hint of regret, "This kid, he's really hiding it deep."</p><p></p><p>When he returned to the courtyard, Su Yu immediately took ownership of the interspatial bag and refined it.</p><p></p><p>The space inside was only about three cubic meters, very small.</p><p></p><p>But for him now, it was enough.</p><p></p><p>He put the lower-grade spirit stones he had accumulated, along with the remaining Qi Condensation Pills, into the interspatial bag. He also put in some clothes and lower-grade spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>"With this thing, it will be much more convenient to go out in the future," Su Yu thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Thirty lower-grade spirit stones, plus the fifteen he got from killing Lin Xiu yesterday, and the twenty-five left in the medicine garden.</p><p></p><p>He now had seventy lower-grade spirit stones in total.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I can properly cultivate for a while."</p><p></p><p>While Su Yu was meditating, at the Lin family's side, the Fourth Elder Lin Hai had also found out his identity.</p><p></p><p>"Su Yu? A little bastard dares to kill my grandson, I will make him die!" Lin Hai growled softly.</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>The Su family's eldest young lady, Su Zhi, returned from the Sword Cultivation Sect. The Patriarch Su Peng held a family banquet to welcome her back, which was a lively affair.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, in a pavilion in Su Zhi's courtyard, Su Zhi, Su Yu, and Su Qing Yi gathered together.</p><p></p><p>Su Qing Yi kept sizing up Su Yu and couldn't help but say, "I really didn't expect it was you who killed that Lin Xiu."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu shook his head, "I had just returned to Jiangcheng when he attacked me without a word. I could only fight back."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Su Qingyi asked doubtfully, "Wasn't he at the third level of qi refining cultivation? How did you kill him?"</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi smiled faintly as she looked at Su Yu, for she knew some inside information. </p><p></p><p>Su Yu pondered for a moment and said, "I also practiced body refining techniques."</p><p></p><p>Su Qingyi's pupils contracted slightly, his expression one of sudden realization as he muttered, "Body refining techniques? So that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>He put aside his disdain for Su Yu, and his tone became much more polite and enthusiastic when speaking to him.</p><p></p><p>As for the young lady Su Zhi, Su Qingyi's tone remained respectful.</p><p></p><p>Because when Su Zhi returned this time, her cultivation had already reached the fifth level of qi refining.</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi began to share some inside stories about the Yunjian Sect, saying, "Do you remember Gongsun Yi, the one who ranked first in the previous disciple admission test?"</p><p></p><p>"He has a earth spiritual root with heavenly talents. I heard his cultivation has reached the seventh level of qi refining, and he was accepted as a direct disciple by the sect leader."</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi then talked about the general situation of the others. Among the thirty disciples admitted that year, not everyone's cultivation went so smoothly.</p><p></p><p>According to Su Zhi, there were still eleven people whose cultivation was stuck at the third level of qi refining.</p><p></p><p>From this point of view, the previously eliminated Su Yu and Su Qingyi might actually be stronger than them.</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi looked at Su Yu and Su Qingyi and said, "In three years, I plan to try for inner disciple status. At that time, I may need your help."</p><p></p><p>Before Su Yu could speak, Su Qingyi had already readily agreed, "No problem, just let me know when the time comes, sister. As long as I can do it, I definitely won't refuse."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu could only reluctantly agree as well. Advancing to inner disciple status in the Yunjian Sect would likely not be simple.</p><p></p><p>But as clansmen, he could not refuse.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Su Yu inquired about the market town under the Yunjian Sect's control and the essence blood of late-stage first-rank demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi said, "The market town is much more prosperous than Jiangcheng. Most of the residents are cultivators, and they have all kinds of spirit pills, talismans, magic treasures, and formation techniques."</p><p></p><p>"If you have the opportunity, you two can apply to go to the Yunshan Market Town. There, you should be able to obtain more resources and opportunities."</p><p></p><p>"As for the essence blood of late-stage first-rank demonic beasts, it's not lacking in the market town, but it's also not cheap. One drop costs two or three low-grade spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>After a long conversation, Su Yu and Su Qingyi left with different feelings.</p><p></p><p>Su Qingyi, having heard about the prosperity of Yunshan Market Town, clearly had his heart set on wilder ambitions. He was filled with longing and determined to become a pill refining apprentice to go to Yunshan Market Town.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu also wanted to go to Yunshan Market Town, but not to settle there. Instead, he wanted to purchase some resources.</p><p></p><p>A round trip of one week would be enough.</p><p></p><p>However, he was still hesitating about whether to go or not.</p><p></p><p>After all, the journey was long and quite risky.</p><p></p><p>After staying at the manor for half a month, Su Yu spent a day persuading the Fifth Elder Su Bin to send him to the herb garden.</p><p></p><p>The Lin family cultivators keeping watch over Su Yu could only flee, gnashing their teeth in hatred.</p><p></p><p>This guy really was afraid to die, damn it.</p><p></p><p>Back at the herb garden, Su Yu resumed his daily life. Every day, apart from cultivating the Wutong Qingmu Technique, body refining arts, and spells, he followed Su Changyu to learn about the planting and growth habits of spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>In his free time, he would hunt a few earth rock rats to obtain their demonic essence blood for cultivating his body refining arts.</p><p></p><p>However, outside, the friction between the Lin and Su families was becoming increasingly intense, with people from the Lin family frequently appearing near the herb garden.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, Su Yu stayed in the herb garden for another year.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

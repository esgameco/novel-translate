        <h1>Chapter 34</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Three high-grade frost talismans covered the entire space of the entrapment formation ahead, enveloping Guitor, Jinding, and the third person together. Layer upon layer of frost covered the three of them.  </p><p></p><p>A single high-grade frost talisman of the first rank would be enough to impede Guitor, Jinding, and the third person, slowing down their movements.</p><p></p><p>Now with three overlapping high-grade frost talismans of the first rank covering them, even though Guitor, Jinding, and the third person were on guard the moment they saw the talismans, they were still slightly affected by the frost talismans, their bodies momentarily stiffening from the cold.</p><p></p><p>And in the next moment, nine more high-grade fire talismans of the first rank came attacking.</p><p></p><p>Guitor's expression changed drastically: "Not good."</p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, two high-grade defensive talismans of the first rank appeared, forming two layers of yellowish barriers enveloping himself.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he controlled the yellowish aura of the earth dragon in the entrapment formation, positioning it in front of the three of them as a defense.</p><p></p><p>Just as he finished doing all this, the nine talismans burst into flames in mid-air. Three of them transformed into towering blazing fires, converging in the air to form a volley of arrow-like flames.</p><p></p><p>These were the Fire Cloud Arrow Talismans!</p><p></p><p>They all shot towards one of the cultivators at the eighth level of the Qi Refining Realm among Guitor, Jinding, and the third person.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!!"</p><p></p><p>The yellowish barrier of the entrapment formation shattered instantly. The first Fire Cloud Arrow tore through the layers of defensive talisman barriers, spell barriers, and artifact barriers on the eighth-level cultivator before finally dissipating.</p><p></p><p>The second and third Fire Cloud Arrow Talismans instantly shredded this eighth-level cultivator to pieces.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>The shattered remains of his body and flesh were still in mid-air when the blazing fires turned them into ashes scattering in the air.</p><p></p><p>The Fire Cloud Arrow Talismans were new talismans developed by Su Yu based on ancient talismans and the high-grade Piercing Cloud Arrow Talisman, possessing the raging power of the fire element, the armor-piercing ability of the Piercing Cloud Arrow, and extreme speed.</p><p></p><p>Each Fire Cloud Arrow packed a punch no less powerful than a full-force strike from a ninth-level cultivator of the Qi Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was even stronger.</p><p></p><p>The surprise attack of three Fire Cloud Arrows instantly killed the eighth-level cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Of the remaining six talismans, only two were aimed at Guitor and Jinding, while the other four were all blasted towards the other eighth-level cultivator by Su Yun.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>There were roars of fire snakes and explosions of fireballs, violently shattering layer after layer of defensive barriers.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" That eighth-level cultivator's eyes widened as he let out a miserable scream and was flung away, spraying mouthfuls of fresh blood. His body was covered in cracks, bleeding profusely, even the blood he coughed up was scorchingly hot from the invasion of the talismans' flames.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>He slammed into the barrier of the entrapment formation behind, severely injured and his aura plummeting.</p><p></p><p>Both Su Yun and Su Yu chose not to attack Guitor and Jinding first, but to deal with their two helpers instead.</p><p></p><p>Previously, it was Guitor and Jinding trying to surround and kill them with the entrapment formation and their two helpers.</p><p></p><p>But now, the situation was reversed!</p><p></p><p>"Boom! Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Guitor easily blocked the two high-grade talismans aimed at him, only stepping back a few paces.</p><p></p><p>However, seeing one of his underlings killed in the blink of an eye and the other severely injured, Guitor's face became extremely ugly, his eyes brimming with murderous intent, gritting his teeth in hatred!</p><p></p><p>He never expected that when Su Yun, Su Zhi, and Su Yu, one at the ninth level and one at the eighth level of the Qi Refining Realm, were attacked, they would immediately unleash a full twelve high-grade talismans of the first rank at the very start!</p><p></p><p>What kind of concept was this?</p><p></p><p>To start a fight by spending four or five hundred low-grade spirit stones right off the bat!!!</p><p></p><p>Guitor questioned whether he could ever afford to spend that much money. Why would he spend it when that money could buy artifacts or cultivation resources instead?</p><p></p><p>How afraid of death were they to use so many talismans at once?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, their cultivation levels were decent, yet they chose not to fight themselves but to throw talismans instead - twelve high-grade talismans of the first rank!...In all these years, this was the first time Guitor had encountered such bizarre cultivators. Fortunately, he was well-prepared.</p><p></p><p>From the previous encounter with Su Yun, he knew Su Yun had quite a few talismans.</p><p></p><p>So those two...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The guy at the 8th level of Qi refining was actually just a recent tool recruited to consume Su Yun's talisman papers. Whether he lived or died didn't matter.  </p><p></p><p>The demon-headed golden eagle gritted his teeth, staring at Su Yu and the others, and said fiercely, "Without talismans, let's see how you can still stop me!"</p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>With the demon-headed golden eagle's thought, a somewhat damaged demonic energy-filled flag appeared and fell down.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a rain of blood descended from the sky. </p><p></p><p>From the ground, one bizarre corpse after another crawled out.</p><p></p><p>Countless corpses howled and charged towards Su Yu's trio to kill them.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the aura of these corpses wasn't strong, at most just the level of the 1st or 2nd Qi refining realm.</p><p></p><p>But as they charged, one corpse after another fused together. In the blink of an eye, a monster with an aura exceeding the ordinary 9th level of Qi refining appeared.</p><p></p><p>"You're dead!!" The demon-headed golden eagle's vicious voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>As the fused monster appeared and killed towards Su Yu's trio, the demon-headed golden eagle acted again, releasing terrifying metallic aura slashing towards Su Yu and Su Zhi, while the monster let out an eerie roar charging at Su Yun.</p><p></p><p>Su Yun, Su Yu, and Su Zhi's expressions changed slightly. Seeing this flag formation in an instant, the three of them gritted their teeth.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill him!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, each of the three took out a stack of talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi's foundation was thin, leaving only two first-grade superior offensive talismans.  </p><p></p><p>But Su Yun had stayed in Yunshan Town for many years. As a qualified first-grade superior pill refiner, he had stockpiled over twenty first-grade superior talismans.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Su Yun took out another six first-grade superior talismans.</p><p></p><p>As for Su Yu, he took out the remaining four first-grade superior Fire Cloud Arrow talismans.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the three expended twelve first-grade superior talismans.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!!"</p><p></p><p>This time, the demon-headed golden eagle only saw raging flames rise up. The demonic souls summoned by his second-grade inferior damaged demonic soul flag were instantly torn apart and incinerated by the raging flames, turning into wisps of black smoke retreating back into the flag.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the power of the twelve first-grade superior offensive talismans landed on him.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>"Puff!"</p><p></p><p>The demon-headed golden eagle felt like his body had fallen into a blazing inferno, shattering and turning to ashes. The terrifying force sent him flying away.</p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>Next, several strands of spiritual power vines appeared to bind his body.</p><p></p><p>"Swish!"</p><p></p><p>A flying sword suddenly killed out from the raging flames, severing the demon-headed golden eagle's head.</p><p></p><p>The demon-headed golden eagle: "......"</p><p></p><p>He wasn't killed by these three people.</p><p></p><p>He was killed by first-grade superior talismans.</p><p></p><p>Who could have imagined these people from small cultivating clans actually had so many first-grade superior talismans?</p><p></p><p>They even used a total of twenty-four on him!</p><p></p><p>That's at least nine hundred low-grade spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>The demon-headed golden eagle cried. Beaten to death by first-grade superior talismans, then died.</p><p></p><p>Swish!</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi's flying sword turned and also killed the remaining 8th level of Qi refining cultivator. She then flew over skillfully to loot the corpses, taking the spatial pouches of the demon-headed golden eagle trio, as well as two formation flags. </p><p></p><p>Finally, she took their heads, which their sects could claim bounties and contributions for.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry, let's go!"</p><p></p><p>After Su Zhi finished collecting everything without checking what was inside, the trio quickly fled on their artifacts, having expended little spiritual power in the recent battle. They flew out over a hundred li before entering the mountains to stop.</p><p></p><p>P.S. Happy Lunar New Year! A freshly written chapter served up, wishing all of us a prosperous new year where our wishes come true and we have good health, good health, good health.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

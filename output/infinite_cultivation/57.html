        <h1>Chapter 57</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu was stunned for a moment when Wu Yigangsaw him suddenly visiting, why did this person come again? </p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Yu, Wu Yigan smiled warmly, "Dao friend Su, I have news about the ice lotus heart, a core material for the foundation pill. It's absolutely true. Currently, I have found three friends to help obtain it. Are you interested in joining us?"</p><p></p><p>"If you're interested, you can have a share of the ice lotus heart."  </p><p></p><p>"But let me make it clear, since the information about the ice lotus heart is provided by me, I'll take the biggest portion of 40%."</p><p></p><p>"The rest is for you all to split."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's heart wavered slightly. </p><p></p><p>The ice lotus heart material was precisely one of the three core ingredients for the foundation pill that the Su family lacked.</p><p></p><p>The other two were a pure second-grade demonic core and the ethereal fruit.</p><p></p><p>Butâ€”</p><p></p><p>Would this guy really invite him to share the benefits?</p><p></p><p>Su Yu didn't believe in this person's character.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, Su Yu politely declined, saying he had taken some pill refining orders and had no time to go out. He thanked Wu for his kindness and saw him out of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Outside, Wu Yigan's expression fluctuated as he gritted his teeth, muttering, "He's still not tempted?"</p><p></p><p>Hmph!</p><p></p><p>He glared at Su Yu's courtyard resentfully before leaving with a wave of his hand.</p><p></p><p>Half a month passed again.</p><p></p><p>That night.</p><p></p><p>In the basement room.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu performed the Body Puppet Technique to extract a strand of his soul. With a stinging pain, Su Yu's face turned slightly pale, and he looked a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, Su Yu focused his mind and gritted his teeth, controlling that strand of soul to enter a top-grade first-level puppet beast in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Then, he pricked his fingertip, and his fresh blood fell onto the puppet beast under his control, merging into its body.</p><p></p><p>"Hum!"</p><p></p><p>As the blood and soul gradually merged into the puppet beast under the effect of the Body Puppet Technique, the originally metallic-looking puppet beast gradually transformed, manifesting a human form.</p><p></p><p>Human skin and hair slowly took shape.</p><p></p><p>Nearly ten days later.</p><p></p><p>In the basement room, a body puppet that looked exactly like Su Yu was formed.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, it transformed into an ordinary-looking old man with slightly white hair, resembling the second elder of the Chen family a bit. If one looked closely, they would notice the resemblance, which Su Yu intentionally made so that even if this body puppet was seen or captured, no one would associate it with him.</p><p></p><p>"Finally succeeded."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu looked at the body puppet with delight. With a thought, the body puppet shifted between human form and the dark panther beast form.</p><p></p><p>With his current level of the Body Puppet Technique, he could only alternate between two forms, but he could change the appearance.</p><p></p><p>And this was enough.</p><p></p><p>After succeeding in the Body Puppet Technique and refining the second-grade lower-level dragon alligator puppet beast, he could withdraw that strand of soul from this top-grade body puppet and fuse it into the dragon alligator puppet beast.</p><p></p><p>At that time, it might only take three or four days to transform into a new body puppet.</p><p></p><p>This top-grade dark panther puppet beast was the initial top-grade first-level puppet product, with a strength of only the eighth level of the Qi Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>It was inferior in quality compared to the one he had sold to the Chen family.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the dragon eagle puppet beast sold to the Yu family.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't matter.</p><p></p><p>Once the second-grade lower-level dragon alligator puppet beast was ready, he could use that puppet beast to transform into a body puppet.</p><p></p><p>This puppet was just a transitional tool.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu controlled the 'old man' body puppet to leave the basement room and wander the streets of Bai Yue Xian City. At the same time, he could also practice the Golden Cicada Technique to recover the damage to his soul.</p><p></p><p>In the following period, Su Yu familiarized himself with the body puppet while methodically cultivating the Cangmu Suixuan Technique, the Alligator Demon's One Hundred and Eight Body Refining Techniques, and the Golden Cicada Technique.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after nearly another month passed.</p><p></p><p>The Alligator Demon's One Hundred and Eight Body Refining Techniques eventually crossed the ninth level, reaching a new realm.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Inside the secret room.</p><p></p><p>Even though Su Yu had activated three array formations, the formation barriers were still shaken by the aura erupting from his body, rippling endlessly, swaying precariously, as if this aura could break through them at any moment. </p><p></p><p>The ninth level of the Alligator Demon's 108 Body Refining Techniques had fully accumulated proficiency, and his realm naturally advanced to the tenth level.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a single level of advancement, this breakthrough was a complete metamorphosis.  </p><p></p><p>From his soul to his physical body, even the spiritual power of the Cypress Wood Epoch Wheel had changed.</p><p></p><p>A soaring blood-red aura pervaded the entire secret room, like a sea of blood.</p><p></p><p>And at the center of the blood sea, Su Yu sat cross-legged, his body having expanded considerably. The blood-colored patterns formed from his blood energy covered his skin like the scales of a giant alligator, making him seem like a humanoid alligator demon.</p><p></p><p>"Huu huu huu!"</p><p></p><p>Boundless spiritual energy of heaven and earth poured in.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with the spirit stones prepared by Su Yu, this commotion did not disturb the heavenly and earthly spiritual energy outside.</p><p></p><p>Time passed in a flash.</p><p></p><p>One day later.</p><p></p><p>The commotion dissipated, and the converged spiritual energy between heaven and earth returned to calm.</p><p></p><p>"Hah!"</p><p></p><p>Inside the secret room, the vast bloody aura was inhaled into Su Yu's mouth, and he then exhaled a condensed white mist that did not disperse, like a tornado sweeping through the room.</p><p></p><p>Crack crack crack!</p><p></p><p>Su Yu opened his eyes, twisting his body and head, the joints of his metamorphosed body cracking loudly. </p><p></p><p>A fierce blood-red light flashed through his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He stood up, his aura faintly releasing with a "Boom!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>The air in the secret room exploded, and even the ground trembled slightly from this aura.</p><p></p><p>Then Su Yu completely restrained his aura, a pleased look appearing on his face. He clenched his fists slightly, feeling the terrifying power in his body, and murmured, "So this is the power of the tenth level of the Alligator Demon Body Refining Techniques?"</p><p></p><p>"With this body of mine, the physical body of an ordinary first level Foundation Establishment cultivator is definitely inferior to me, unless they have also cultivated body refining techniques."</p><p></p><p>"If I get in close combat, I could probably shatter the physical body of an ordinary first level Foundation Establishment cultivator with just one punch!"</p><p></p><p>Feeling comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Having successfully broken through to the tenth level of the Body Refining Techniques, Su Yu took a rare day of rest, doing nothing but his daily cultivation and basking in the sun in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>But the next day, Wu Yungang came calling again, inviting him to form a team to seek the Ice Heart Lotus.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Yu declined again, angering Wu Yungang to the point of leaving in a huff.</p><p></p><p>"Don't regret it!" Wu Yungang cursed angrily.</p><p></p><p>Watching Wu Yungang's back as he left the alley, Su Yu's eyes narrowed, a cold sneer appearing on his face, a fierce glint flashing through.</p><p></p><p>"The Ice Heart Lotus, if it really exists, I can't miss it," Su Yu murmured softly.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>His spirit body puppet quietly left, carrying a cosmic bag and a beast subjugation bag, using the supreme concealment techniques of the Cypress Wood Epoch Wheel to follow far behind Wu Yungang undetected.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Wu Yungang arrived at a private room in a tavern, cursing, "That guy is such a coward. Tsk, I originally wanted to bring him into the Primordial Yang Wilderness to scout ahead as cannon fodder, but now there's no way."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, that Ice Heart Lotus is almost mature. If we don't go in now, we'll miss our chance and the demonic beasts will eat it."</p><p></p><p>In the private room were three other cultivators, all at the ninth level of the Qi Refining realm, two men and one woman.</p><p></p><p>Judging by their appearances, these three cultivators looked middle-aged, especially the female cultivator, who resembled a well-ripened lady.</p><p></p><p>Note on the tenth level Body Refining Techniques 'shattering Foundation Establishment realm bodies with one punch': Cultivators without body refining have very fragile physical bodies. The tenth level of body refining techniques is equivalent to the power of the first level Foundation Establishment realm. The passage means that in close combat after breaking through defenses, one has the ability to shatter the bodies of Foundation Establishment cultivators who have not cultivated body refining techniques. It is no longer powerless against the Foundation Establishment realm, and can threaten or even kill them. It does not mean literally being able to shatter them with a single strike.</p><p></p><p>In an actual fight, a first level Foundation Establishment cultivator's power is greater than that of body refining at the same realm, with higher odds of winning.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

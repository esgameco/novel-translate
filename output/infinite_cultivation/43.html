        <h1>Chapter 43</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>A year after breaking through to the Foundation Establishment realm, Su Zhi held a banquet in Yunshan Town, inviting many disciples of the Cloud Sword Sect, including Luo Qianyu, the personal disciple of the Great Elder, Sect Elder Yu Qingqing from the inner Pill Pavilion, as well as Su Yu, Chen Sisi, Su Qingyi, and others.</p><p></p><p>At the banquet, Su Yu noticed that the person who had changed the most over the years was Luo Qianyu. </p><p></p><p>It had been less than five years since she broke through to the Foundation Establishment realm, but her cultivation had already reached the second level of Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>It seemed she was not far from the third level.</p><p></p><p>This talent truly befitted being the personal disciple of the Great Elder of the Cloud Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>At this banquet, Su Yu was like a transparent person. Aside from nodding in acknowledgment to the few people like Luo Qianyu and Yu Qingqing whom he had met before, he just sat quietly in a corner.</p><p></p><p>After the banquet ended, Su Yu chatted with Su Zhi for a while and took from her some puppet beast materials that he had previously asked Su Zhi to collect privately.</p><p></p><p>A pair of wings from second-grade early-stage Iron-Winged Demon Beasts!</p><p></p><p>And claws from the Iron-Winged Demon Beasts too!</p><p></p><p>"With these, even at the Qi Condensation realm or first-grade demon beasts, few can withstand a single strike from the Dragon Eagle Puppet Beast. If they can, then two strikes will do," Su Yu hurriedly returned to the Pill Pavilion and went straight to the secret room, full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Another year and a half passed.</p><p></p><p>On this day, in the secret room, Su Yu looked at the monster standing before him, nearly two zhang (6-7 meters) tall, with a silver-white body, a pair of huge wings, a set of sharp claws, but also a long dragon tail.</p><p></p><p>Although this creature looked a bit strange, its strength was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu stood admiring it for a long time, increasingly satisfied. This 'Dragon Eagle Puppet Beast' that he had researched for over two years was finally completed.</p><p></p><p>It was just that the cost was a bit higher than he had imagined, nearly three thousand low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"This thing, I don't know if it can withstand the Foundation Establishment realm, but for the Qi Condensation realm and first-grade demon beasts, facing it would just be a matter of one strike!"</p><p></p><p>Three thousand low-grade spirit stones, worth it!</p><p></p><p>After admiring it, Su Yu finally put the puppet beast into his qiankun bag and left the secret room.</p><p></p><p>He had been secluded in the secret room for more than half a year and didn't know what was happening outside.</p><p></p><p>When he saw his master Su Yun again, he could visibly see that Su Yun was aging year by year. His originally silver hair was now half white.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, Su Yu had been at the Pill Pavilion for twelve or thirteen years. The originally seventy-something-year-old Second Elder was now ninety years old.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Yu come out of seclusion and his appearance hardly changed over so many years, Su Yun remarked with a tinge of sadness, "I feel that your future achievements will surpass that little girl Su Zhi. You are much more steady than I imagined."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the hint of sorrow in Su Yun's tone, Su Yu's heart skipped a beat, and he asked, "What's wrong? I was only secluded for a little over half a year, everything should still be fine outside, right?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yun was silent for a moment, then said, "The Great Elder was ambushed on the way to the Chen Family and died. Qingyi betrayed the family and joined the demonic path."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's pupils shrank as anger welled up inside him.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu exclaimed in shock, "The Great Elder is gone!? Su Qingyi betrayed the family and joined the demonic path!? How dare he, he's courting death!"</p><p></p><p>Su Yun fell silent again, then said, "The Fifth Elder and Xiao Zhi went looking for him, but couldn't find him. The demonic cultivators who ambushed the Great Elder also disappeared without a trace."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu frowned, "Why would those demonic cultivators ambush the Great Elder?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yun shook his head, puzzled himself. He had even harbored suspicions, and the Su Family had been on guard against unexpected incidents, but nothing had happened so far.</p><p></p><p>So now Su Yun was inclined to think that perhaps the Great Elder had just encountered those demonic cultivators by chance and an accident occurred.</p><p></p><p>"The Fifth Elder is now the Patriarch of the Su Family. The Family Master wants me to return as the Great Elder, with you taking over the Pill Pavilion and becoming the Fifth Elder of the family."</p><p></p><p>Su Yun continued, "The Third Elder is now the Second Elder, and the Fourth Elder is the Third Elder. The position of Fourth Elder is taken by Jingbang. His cultivation reached the eighth level of Qi Condensation a few years ago. The Third and Fourth Elders' cultivations are now at the ninth level of Qi Condensation."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu frowned in silence.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Su Yun glanced at him, waved his hand, and a somewhat shy youth at the fourth layer of Qi Refining realm walked over, respectfully bowed and said to Su Yu: "Su Ruian, meeting the Fifth Elder."</p><p></p><p>Su Yun said, "Ruian is a junior from the eldest branch, considered your nephew. He's nineteen this year." </p><p></p><p>"He has a medium-grade wood spiritual root. I've taught him these days, and he does have some talent in pill refining. As long as he works hard, becoming a first-grade top-rank pill refining master shouldn't be a problem."</p><p></p><p>Apart from Su Ruian, there were a few other pill refining disciples who came to the Pill Pavilion. </p><p></p><p>These young faces livened up the Pill Pavilion a bit.</p><p></p><p>Su Yun introduced the new young fellows to Su Yu, then said, "I know your ambition lies not in the Pill Pavilion, or even the family."</p><p></p><p>"However, we old folks are aging. The family will have to rely on you youngsters in the future."</p><p></p><p>"The Pill Pavilion still needs someone to oversee it. So, take a look at Ruian and the others, try to choose a successor."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, Su Yun took out a jade slip and handed it to Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>Su Yun said, "This is a second-grade lower-rank pill refining heritage that the former Fifth Elder obtained for you at an auction in Baiyue Immortal City some time ago."</p><p></p><p>"With my master's limited talent, breaking through to the Foundation Establishment realm is almost impossible. This second-grade lower-rank pill refining heritage can only be a wish."</p><p></p><p>"I hope I can still witness the birth of our Su Family's first second-grade pill refining master."</p><p></p><p>Su Yun looked at Su Yu with hopeful eyes.</p><p></p><p>Half a month after Su Yu's seclusion, a Qi Refining seventh layer clansman named Su Dajun became the new person in charge of transporting spirit medicines.</p><p></p><p>With Su Dajun's arrival, Su Yun left the town with the spirit medicine transport team and returned to the family's Cang Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu felt a bit uncomfortable, but there wasn't much going on at the Pill Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Teaching those little fellows, and even the former first-grade middle-rank pill refining master and three first-grade lower-rank pill refining masters at the Pill Pavilion wasn't difficult.</p><p></p><p>Although it happened suddenly, Su Yu didn't plan to leave so quickly either.</p><p></p><p>At least, before his cultivation reached the seventh layer of Qi Refining realm, and his pill refining, talisman drawing, and puppet refining side occupations reached the second-grade lower-rank, he didn't plan to leave.</p><p></p><p>"I have second-grade heritages for pill refining and puppet refining, so now I'm just missing a talisman drawing one." During his daily cultivation, pill refining, and talisman drawing, Su Yu pondered about obtaining a second-grade talisman drawing heritage.</p><p></p><p>That day, as Su Yu headed towards the Heavenly Book Pavilion, a sharp light suddenly flashed towards him.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, there were also numerous hair-thin long needles secretly attacking.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment, a golden light appeared on Su Yu's body, forming a bell-shaped barrier with two dragon and tiger beasts roaring in all directions, making the golden bell seem even more solid.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!!!"</p><p></p><p>The incoming projectiles like arrows hit the golden bell and were immediately deflected away.</p><p></p><p>The hair-thin long needles were stuck motionless in the golden bell barrier.</p><p></p><p>This was the first-grade top-rank defensive talisman, the Dragon Tiger Talisman, that Su Yu drew and modified from the Golden Light Talisman.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu looked towards the attacker's direction. Although the person looked unfamiliar with a disfigured face, that life aura...Su Yu recalled the past and blurted out, "Lin Danlang? Is that you?"</p><p></p><p>This guy didn't die?</p><p></p><p>But with just the seventh layer of Qi Refining cultivation, he dared to attack him?</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, as Lin Danlang's face changed drastically and he turned to flee, Su Yu took out a first-grade top-rank Fire Cloud Arrow Talisman and infused it with spiritual power to activate it.</p><p></p><p>"Swish!"</p><p></p><p>A crimson blazing arrow shot out horizontally, piercing into Lin Danlang's back.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The flames scattered, erupting a cloud of blood mist.</p><p></p><p>From the moment the Cang Mountain spiritual vein appeared, the ending or perhaps the karmic cycle between the Su and Lin families had already been determined. The last remnant of the Lin family finally met a gory demise without an intact corpse.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>If it was just the two elders Su Chang and Su Ruosu acting alone, it's hard to say whether they could defeat Guo Chudong or not. </p><p></p><p>But with the layered great formations of the Medicine Garden, even if Guo Chudong was a ninth level Refining Qi realm first rank Geomancer, he would still be trapped and die here.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Medicine Garden.</p><p></p><p>Lin Kui tried to lead the Lin family cultivators to attack the great formations defending the garden. Although they could shake the barrier formations, causing ripples to spread across them, it was far from enough to break through the great formations and rescue Guo Chudong, Lin Hai and the others.</p><p></p><p>Lin Kui was both shocked and enraged, his face changing rapidly as he gritted his teeth and shouted, "Su Chang, I know you can definitely hear me."</p><p></p><p>"Release Lin Hai, and from now on my Lin family will no longer be enemies with your Su family, and we will no longer covet this spiritual vein."  </p><p></p><p>"I, Lin Kui, am a man of my word."</p><p></p><p>However, after waiting for a while, there was no response at all from inside the great formations, the surrounding mountains deathly silent without even a bird, the quiet unsettling.</p><p></p><p>Lin Kui couldn't help but rage, "Su Chang, if you dare lay a hand on Lin Hai, then don't blame my Lin family for fighting your Su family to the death!"</p><p></p><p>"If you want to die, then make a move!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Kui cursed and tried every trick outside the Medicine Garden, but the people inside the formations ignored him completely.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that a long time had passed, Lin Kui gritted his teeth, his face darkening as he turned and said in a low voice, "Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>"Back to the family!"</p><p></p><p>They failed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Kui's eyes flashed with killing intent, even towards this Geomancer Guo Chudong.</p><p></p><p>Because he suspected this was a conspiracy and plot between Guo Chudong and the Su family, with the aim of dealing with the Lin family.</p><p></p><p>But then he thought again, and it didn't seem right.</p><p></p><p>If this Guo had colluded with the Su family to deal with the Lin family, they should have lured them all inside.</p><p></p><p>Only by setting up such an elaborate ambush could they severely cripple the Lin family.</p><p></p><p>Now, only Lin Hai was trapped inside, so although the Lin family lost an elder, it wasn't crippling.</p><p></p><p>So it seemed Guo Chudong had not betrayed the Lin family.</p><p></p><p>Then what was going on?</p><p></p><p>Didn't this Guo say the horde of rock rats living under the spiritual vein had revolted and were attacking the Su family's people?</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that their Medicine Garden's great formations could suppress so many demonic beasts? Impossible, a few dozen at most."</p><p></p><p>"But there were hundreds of those demonic beasts. Even if Su Chang controlled the formations, expending all his spiritual power could only deal with a small portion."</p><p></p><p>Lin Kui couldn't figure it out, "Moreover, this Guo said he had already sabotaged the Su family's Medicine Garden formations."</p><p></p><p>"Logically, they should only be able to deal with the revolting rock rat horde on their own."</p><p></p><p>If that was really the case, the Lin family joining forces with Guo Chudong should have no problem subduing the Su family.</p><p></p><p>But why did the Su family seem completely unaffected?</p><p></p><p>Their formations were not broken either.</p><p></p><p>What Lin Kui couldn't have imagined was that the rock rat horde he saw as the biggest threat had simply been drugged by a junior member of the Su family.</p><p></p><p>Not only did the Su family suffer no losses, they even gained nearly 200 demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>Lin Kui led the Lin family members away.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Medicine Garden, the trapped Guo Chudong was not flustered, instead chatting with Su Chang and the others.</p><p></p><p>"So my making the rock rat horde revolt actually helped you?" Guo Chudong was astonished.</p><p></p><p>If you had this thing, why didn't you clear out the rock rat horde beforehand instead of leaving them there?</p><p></p><p>Guo Chudong felt a bit depressed.</p><p></p><p>He really hadn't anticipated this, otherwise he wouldn't have tried to scheme against the Su family like this.</p><p></p><p>After more than an hour passed.</p><p></p><p>The Su family patriarch Su Peng personally came with others, joining several Su family elders. In an instant, they captured the trapped Guo Chudong and took control of him.</p><p></p><p>In the Medicine Pavilion...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After listening to Su Chang's account, Su Peng felt a lingering sense of dread. </p><p></p><p>If Guo Chudong and the Lin family really succeeded, the Su family would definitely suffer a heavy blow. </p><p></p><p>Not only would they lose the medicine garden, but they would also face the crisis of annihilation.</p><p></p><p>At that point, the only way to preserve the Su family lineage would be to flee far away from Jiangcheng.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Su Peng looked at Su Yu with an exceptionally gentle gaze. Adding what he learned about Su Yu's character and conduct from the Third Elder, Su Peng said, "Little Yu, what reward would you like? Just say it, as long as the family can make it happen."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu shook his head and said, "The head of the family need not do this. I am a member of the Su family, raised by the family since I was young. Now that the family is facing a threat, I should do my utmost to protect it."</p><p></p><p>"Aiya."</p><p></p><p>Su Peng interrupted, "I'm gratified that you think this way, but accomplishments should be rewarded. The family cannot abandon its rules."</p><p></p><p>"Think about what you want first."</p><p></p><p>After a moment of hesitation, Su Yu said, "My cultivation should allow me to break through to the fourth level of Refining Qi in one or two years. At that time, I hope the head of the family can allow me to take an alchemist as my master and learn pill refinement."</p><p></p><p>Su Peng, Su Chang, Su Ruosu, and the others were all stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>This—</p><p></p><p>What kind of reward is this?</p><p></p><p>Su Peng looked deeply at Su Yu and said, "Never mind, I will discuss the matter of your reward with the elders later."</p><p></p><p>"As for your wish to learn pill refinement, you can talk to the Third Elder about it later. It's not an urgent matter."</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand to dismiss Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>Su Peng looked at the family elders with a helpless smile and said, "This kid is like a weirdo. He didn't ask for a reward but instead gave us a headache."</p><p></p><p>Su Chang chuckled, "Head of the family, previously he also provided the formula for the Beast Luring Powder to the family. Its effects are truly remarkable. Even earth rats in the late first stage of Refining Qi couldn't resist the temptation of that powder when enraged and would immediately collapse after consuming it."</p><p></p><p>"I have never heard of this powder before, which means none of the families within the radius of the Cloud Sword Sect have it."</p><p></p><p>"And earth rats, these demonic beasts, can be found in almost every spiritual vein—"</p><p></p><p>Su Peng, Su Ruosu, and the others' eyes lit up upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>In that case, the formula for this powder is invaluable.</p><p></p><p>But even considering this, the question of how to reward Su Yu became even more perplexing.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Su Ruosu suddenly said, "Su Zhi has her own path to follow in the Cloud Sword Sect, so it's not advisable for her to return to the family."</p><p></p><p>"Then who in my Su family will succeed me in the future?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu returned to his room and chatted with his master, Su Changyu, and his three senior martial brothers. They were all extremely shocked by Su Yu's performance during this crisis.</p><p></p><p>After the initial shock, Su Changyu felt quite happy for Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>This time, he finally saw clearly that Su Yu was no ordinary person, and his future achievements would far surpass his own.</p><p></p><p>It's possible that he could even become one of the family elders in the future.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Su Changyu felt delighted, for having such an outstanding disciple would bring great honor to him as a master.</p><p></p><p>After Su Changyu and the others left, the sky had already begun to brighten.</p><p></p><p>Su Qingyi found Su Yu, his expression somewhat complicated as he said, "Now I see that you have no fewer secrets than I do."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu laughed but didn't explain, saying, "I don't think you came to see me just to say this?"</p><p></p><p>Su Qingyi nodded, "I was originally planning to tell you in a couple of days, but I didn't expect this incident to happen today. I have secured an opportunity to become an alchemy apprentice at the Pill Pavilion in Yunshan Market Town, and I will be leaving by the end of the month."</p><p></p><p>"That's good news," Su Yu said, happy for Su Qingyi.</p><p></p><p>The two companions who had participated in the Cloud Sword Sect's disciple admission test together in the past, one stayed in the sect to cultivate, while the other achieved one goal after another under the guidance of the family.</p><p></p><p>As for himself, he was also steadily cultivating, each with their own experiences and accomplishments.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

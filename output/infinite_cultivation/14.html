            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Another hour passed.</p><p></p><p>By another bookshelf, Su Yu frowned as he looked at the ancient book in his hands. This ancient book was neither a cultivation manual nor a body refining technique, but rather a strange esoteric method. </p><p></p><p>It could even be called a pseudo-supernatural power. </p><p></p><p>It was a method created to imitate the innate supernatural powers that existed in the ancient powerful beings of the past.</p><p></p><p>This method was called: Blood Whale Devouring the Moon Technique.</p><p></p><p>It imitated the ancient demonic tribe's powerful beings and combined with body refining techniques. </p><p></p><p>The ancient book recorded that by using the bloodline of the Heavenly Devouring Whale demonic tribe as the origin, one could create a pseudo-supernatural origin within the body.</p><p></p><p>This pseudo-supernatural origin possessed the ability to devour.</p><p></p><p>It could devour the essence of heaven and earth, accumulating it within the origin.</p><p></p><p>When the moment came to unleash the pseudo-supernatural power, it could explosively release power more than double its normal level in an instant.</p><p></p><p>In ancient times, the Heavenly Devouring Whale demonic tribe was a powerful clan, but as the demonic tribes declined and due to this pseudo-supernatural power, countless cultivators hunted and killed the Heavenly Devouring Whale demonic tribe one after another. Nowadays, this ancient Heavenly Devouring Whale demonic tribe had long been exterminated.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, this Blood Whale Devouring the Moon Technique became like the Willow Wood Yearly Cycle Technique - a redundant and tasteless technique that was a pity to discard.</p><p></p><p>"Enough."</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing this method, Su Yu immediately took the two ancient books and walked towards the counter.</p><p></p><p>Behind the counter of the Heavenly Book Pavilion was an elderly white-haired man. After the few customers in front finished checking out, he noticed the two ancient books Su Yu brought over.</p><p></p><p>The old man couldn't help but glance at Su Yu, somewhat surprised: "Two ancient books, fifty low-grade spirit stones each. You can read them yourself but cannot spread them externally. Once sold, our shop does not accept returns or exchanges."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu painfully took out a hundred low-grade spirit stones from his cosmic bag and exchanged them for two newly transcribed books from the old man's hands.</p><p></p><p>After flipping through them, Su Yu's brows furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Willow Wood Yearly Cycle Technique recorded in these books only had three cycles with twenty-seven rotations in total.</p><p></p><p>As for the Blood Whale Devouring the Moon Technique, it was only the first volume, divided into five realms.</p><p></p><p>Upon reaching each realm, one's strength could increase by a factor, up to five times.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, it recorded that those who cultivated the Blood Whale Devouring the Moon Technique must have an extremely powerful physical body, otherwise they might not be able to withstand the explosive force of the pseudo-supernatural power and end up bursting their bodies and dying.</p><p></p><p>In summary, the stronger the explosive power you unleashed, the stronger your physical body had to be to endure it.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, even if you didn't die, you would suffer severe injuries.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Su Yu had paid, the old man at the Heavenly Book Pavilion smiled: "Young man, if you manage to cultivate these two ancient extraordinary techniques, you will certainly have a place in the great Cultivation World in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, even if you can't cultivate them, don't be disheartened. Believe that in this vast world, there will definitely be an extraordinary technique suited for you. My Heavenly Book Pavilion collects many cultivation and extraordinary techniques, so remember to come often."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu: "..."</p><p></p><p>He felt like baring his teeth to bite someone upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>This old man was eyeing his money bag.</p><p></p><p>Did he think Su Yu was easy to deceive?</p><p></p><p>Su Jingbang came over to Su Yu's side and upon seeing him spend a hundred low-grade spirit stones to buy two useless books, his expression immediately became strange.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Su Yu like he was a pitiful fool, no wonder the shopkeeper welcomed him to come often.</p><p></p><p>"You should have known better. These things look good but are useless. Remember this lesson about being taken advantage of." Su Jingbang shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He didn't say much more. After seeing Su Yu check out, he led Su Yu out of the Heavenly Book Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu put the two cultivation methods into his cosmic bag, feeling quite pleased.</p><p></p><p>It may have seemed like the Heavenly Book Pavilion made a huge profit, but with his Proficiency Panel, he definitely didn't lose out.</p><p></p><p>Both parties were very happy.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Su Jingbang brought Su Yu to a shop that specialized in selling demonic beast materials.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Yu Family's shop from Black Rock Mountain. The prices for demonic beast materials are quite reasonable here," said Su Jingbang.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu was familiar with the Black Rock Mountain Yu Family. This was one...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>A cultivating family much more powerful than the Su family, it was rumored that the Yu family had five Foundation Establishment cultivators and were skilled in beast taming.</p><p></p><p>Black Rock Mountain was then a blessed land, with a second-grade spirit vein underneath.  </p><p></p><p>Besides this shop, the Yu family had another shop in the market town that specialized in selling spirit pets.</p><p></p><p>Here, Su Yu purchased thirty-five drops of late first-grade demonic beast essence blood, with prices ranging from two to three low-grade spirit stones, spending nearly one hundred low-grade spirit stones.  </p><p></p><p>The stronger the demonic beast essence blood, the slightly more expensive the price.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the two wandered around the market town for a while.</p><p></p><p>There were indeed many good things here, and Su Yu was very tempted to buy many things he saw, but he didn't have many low-grade spirit stones left.</p><p></p><p>After wandering around for a while, the two returned to the Pill Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>In the evening.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu spent three low-grade spirit stones to buy a jug of spirit wine and invited Su Jingbang and others to drink together. After eating and drinking their fill, they returned to a small room arranged by the Second Elder.</p><p></p><p>Sitting cross-legged on the bed, Su Yu took out the 'Cyan Wood Yearly Cycle Technique' and 'Blood Whale Swallowing Moon Technique' from his spatial bag.</p><p></p><p>The main focus was the Cyan Wood Yearly Cycle Technique. Although it only had three cycles and twenty-seven rotations, at least Su Yu would have no problem cultivating it until the Pill Formation stage.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this technique, Su Yu was delighted in his heart: "If I can successfully convert and cultivate this technique, then I will make this my main cultivation technique in the future."</p><p></p><p>The Willow Jade Wood Mantra was too ordinary. Previously, he had no choice.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had the better Cyan Wood Yearly Cycle Technique, Su Yu naturally hoped to be able to convert to it.</p><p></p><p>"Let me try it."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu began to try.</p><p></p><p>The 'Cyan Wood Yearly Cycle Technique' required the cyan wood origin aura to start cultivating, a special kind of power that Su Yu naturally could not possess.</p><p></p><p>He could only slowly try to see if he could start cultivating the technique by relying on the proficiency panel.</p><p></p><p>One night passed.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu gained nothing.</p><p></p><p>But after trying to cultivate the 'Cyan Wood Yearly Cycle Technique' for one night, the next day he felt refreshed, his spiritual energy seeming more vibrant than before.</p><p></p><p>This gave Su Yu a glimmer of hope, and he was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu followed Su Jingbang's group and left the Cloud Mountain Market Town, beginning their return journey.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the market town.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Su Jingbang glanced at a few places, his expression indifferent, and then the hidden auras at those few places retreated far away.</p><p></p><p>Places like the edge of the market town were where bandits liked to lurk the most.</p><p></p><p>However, most of these bandits were not very powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go quickly."</p><p></p><p>Su Jingbang said in a low voice, taking the lead to speed up their departure.</p><p></p><p>The return journey was also smooth, without any attacks. Even when they were near Jiangcheng, there were no ambushes from the opposing Lin family.</p><p></p><p>They returned safely to the Medicine Garden. When Su Changyu saw him return, knowing that Su Yu's heart was not in the Medicine Garden, he pondered and said, "After studying for another year, you should be able to try taking a master and learn pill refining."</p><p></p><p>"You have cultivated the Spirit Storing Technique, which gives you an advantage over others. However, your cultivation level is a weakness."</p><p></p><p>"Most others start learning pill refining at the fourth level of Qi Condensation, otherwise their spiritual power can hardly sustain it."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Yu smiled, "Teacher, I'm not in a hurry."</p><p></p><p>"Let's talk about it again after I reach the fourth level of Qi Condensation."</p><p></p><p>Su Changyu sighed and patted Su Yu's shoulder, "Then cultivate well. You have more potential than me. Apart from knowledge about medicinal herbs, I can't help you much with other things."</p><p></p><p>In the following days, apart from his daily cultivation, Su Yu mainly tried to convert to the 'Cyan Wood Yearly Cycle Technique'.</p><p></p><p>After a month of trying, Su Yu's aura began to change.</p><p></p><p>He had successfully converted and started cultivating the 'Cyan Wood Yearly Cycle Technique'.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

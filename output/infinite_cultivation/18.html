        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Ten miles away from the Su Family's Herbal Garden.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the geomancer Guo Chudong, invited by the Su Family at great expense, had come here with a few apprentices and joined a group of people. </p><p></p><p>Seeing Guo Chudong and others arrive, the two Lin Family elders who had been waiting for a long time were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The fourth elder, Lin Hai, hurriedly went up to ask, "Daoist Guo, what's the situation?"</p><p></p><p>Guo Chudong was neither tall nor thin, with white hair and a face full of wrinkles. He looked older than Lin Hai, but in fact, he was ten years younger than Lin Hai, only in his fifties.</p><p></p><p>As a geomancer, he had far more cultivation resources than ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation had already reached the ninth level of the Qi Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>This trip to the Su Family was for Guo Chudong to accumulate resources to break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm.</p><p></p><p>Guo Chudong said indifferently, "The guardian beasts of the spiritual vein have gone into a frenzy. Although their number is less than I estimated, there are still two to three hundred of them."</p><p></p><p>"There are also three late-stage demonic beasts. When in a frenzy, the Rock Rats will become extremely bloodthirsty, and their strength will increase."</p><p></p><p>"With the cultivators' strength in the Su Family's Herbal Garden, even if they don't all die, they will definitely suffer heavy casualties."</p><p></p><p>"Wait another hour, and when the frenzied Rock Rats and demonic beasts retreat, we can enter."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lin Hai and the Lin Family's eldest elder, Lin Kui, were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Kui hurriedly stepped forward and said, "With Daoist Guo's help, even if the Su Family doesn't die this time, they will have to roll out of Jiangcheng."</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Guo, rest assured, the Lin Family's reward will be delivered with both hands when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>A hint of a smile appeared on Guo Chudong's face as he said, "Just wait."</p><p></p><p>The Su Family had only paid him a deposit for seeking the dragon vein and constructing a blessed land.</p><p></p><p>But after the Su Family found him, the Lin Family also found him.</p><p></p><p>For Guo Chudong, neither the Su Family nor the Lin Family mattered.</p><p></p><p>What mattered was that the Lin Family said that if he helped deal with the Su Family and take over that first-grade spiritual vein, the Lin Family would double the reward after success.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Guo Chudong felt anticipation and thought to himself, 'With that money, I can try to collect the materials for the Foundation Establishment Pill and have someone refine it.'</p><p></p><p>Foundation Establishment!</p><p></p><p>Guo Chudong clenched his teeth silently. For a geomancer to establish the foundation was at least ten times more difficult than for ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had failed twice.</p><p></p><p>If he failed againâ€”</p><p></p><p>Guo Chudong thought of his limited lifespan and fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Whether successful or failed, he was still a geomancer.</p><p></p><p>Years ago, when he opened the ancient jade box and obtained the incomplete geomancer's inheritance, he was overjoyed and unhesitatingly chose to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Little did he know that this geomancer's inheritance would now be like a death talisman, not only locking his path to establishing the foundation but also devouring countless years of his lifespan.</p><p></p><p>Everyone waited here for an hour.</p><p></p><p>According to Guo Chudong's estimation, at this time, the Rock Rats would recover from their frenzy and most of them would return underground, greatly reducing the danger.</p><p></p><p>At this point, entering the Su Family's Herbal Garden and cleaning up the aftermath would allow them to easily seize the Herbal Garden.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Following Guo Chudong's low shout, along with over a hundred cultivators from the Lin Family, everyone charged towards the Su Family's Herbal Garden.</p><p></p><p>Upon arriving outside the Su Family's Herbal Garden, Guo Chudong said with some pride, "During this period, under the guise of seeking the dragon vein, I have already grasped the great formation of the Su Family's Herbal Garden and even tampered with a few nodes."</p><p></p><p>"So we can go in directly."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he took out several formation flags and integrated them into the several layers of the great formation around the Su Family's Herbal Garden, controlling the formation.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Guo Chudong said, "Done."</p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>With a thought, an entrance immediately opened in the great formation ahead.</p><p></p><p>Guo Chudong led a few apprentices in first, followed by Lin Hai. Just as Lin Kui was about to lead the Lin Family members in...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>When the group of cultivators entered together, the originally open layers of formations suddenly closed, sealing the entrance. </p><p></p><p>Lin Kui was stunned for a moment: "What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Guo, Daoist Guo."</p><p></p><p>Lin Kui called out a few times, but there was no response.</p><p></p><p>As he was puzzled, suddenly the front few layers of formations erupted with intense aura. This abnormal situation immediately caused Lin Kui's expression to change drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>Inside the formation enclosure.</p><p></p><p>Guo Chudong, Lin Hai and others who had just entered the medicine garden were also stunned, as the formation barrier closed behind them.</p><p></p><p>Guo Chudong even sensed that the few formation flags he had integrated into the great formation had been destroyed by someone. </p><p></p><p>He lost control over the medicine garden's great formation.</p><p></p><p>Guo Chudong's heart skipped a beat, and his face changed slightly: "Not good."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the cold and murderous voice of the Third Elder Su Chang rang in their ears: "Guo Chudong, my Su family has treated you well. The price you asked for lending a hand is worth a Foundation Establishment Pill."</p><p></p><p>"But you colluded with the Lin family, trying to seize my Su family's medicine garden. You even instigated the rock rat demons to rebel, wanting my Su family to die."</p><p></p><p>"You have such audacity!"</p><p></p><p>Su Chang roared angrily, then continued towards Lin Hai: "Lin Hai, your Lin family has provoked my Su family again and again. Do you really think my Su family is easy to bully?"</p><p></p><p>"Today you came in here, so don't think about leaving again!"</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Su Chang activated all the layers of the great formation in the medicine garden. These were top-tier first-grade formations that the Su family spent a huge sum to set up.</p><p></p><p>Besides the defensive formation, there were also killing and trapping formations.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps they were difficult to deal with for Foundation Establishment cultivators, but they were easy to handle for Qi Condensation cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the aura of the great formation, Guo Chudong's face changed again. With a wave of his hand, formation flags appeared one by one.</p><p></p><p>But before he could break the formation, a raging wind swept in from the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the sharp aura of that raging wind, even Guo Chudong, a ninth layer Qi Condensation cultivator, couldn't help but feel his scalp go numb.</p><p></p><p>In desperation, he could only set up a defensive formation around himself.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!!"</p><p></p><p>The raging wind struck. The few disciples around him, including Lin Hai, could only resist for a moment before turning into a bloody mist, killed by the great formation.</p><p></p><p>Shrill, miserable screams echoed in Guo Chudong's ears.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Su Chang sensed Guo Chudong setting up a formation to defend against the raging wind attack, and couldn't help revealing a hint of graveness in his eyes, thinking to himself: "This person is indeed not simple."</p><p></p><p>The two sides deadlocked for a moment, then Guo Chudong's voice came from the formation he set up: "Daoist Su, shall we talk about how to resolve this?"</p><p></p><p>"Your formation can't do anything to me, and I've also set up some tricks in the spirit vein."</p><p></p><p>"If you really push me too far, although I can't destroy the spirit vein, letting it suffer serious damage is no problem at all."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Chang's face instantly changed.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't put all of the Lin family's people inside earlier, because he was afraid this person might have other tricks up his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Plus, the Lin family's Elder Lin Kui was at the ninth layer of Qi Condensation. If they joined forces, who knew if there might be an accident.</p><p></p><p>So he didn't put everyone inside.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't expect that even just Guo Chudong alone would be so difficult to deal with.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Su Yu said in a low voice: "Third Granduncle, you can trap him first. When the Patriarch and others arrive, we can discuss further."</p><p></p><p>"As long as we subdue him, he'll just be a lamb awaiting slaughter. Whether he lives or dies will be up to our Su family to decide."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Su Chang's eyes immediately lit up.</p><p>Subduing a Geomancer - that would bring great benefits to the Su family.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

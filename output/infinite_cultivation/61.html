        <h1>Chapter 61</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>With perfect materials for a Foundation Establishment Pill, one can typically refine three or four pellets. </p><p></p><p>A regular, ordinary Foundation Establishment Pill is worth around eight thousand low-grade spirit stones in Bai Yue Immortal City. </p><p></p><p>Pills with flaws are priced slightly lower.</p><p></p><p>However, this is just the price. Even in Bai Yue Immortal City, it may take ten or twenty years before one or two ordinary Foundation Establishment Pills come out. </p><p></p><p>If you want to buy one, it's very difficult. Not only do you need money, but you also need the opportunity and luck to obtain it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, although the Foundation Establishment Pill is precious, the price of the Void Spirit Fruit, which is one of the core ingredients, will not be too high since it is just one of the ingredients and not the actual pill. The family allowed Su Zhi to bring six thousand low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>The Void Spirit Fruit is one of the targets. If possible, she will also look to see if she can bid on other lacking core ingredients.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu invited Su Zhi into the courtyard, and they sat across from each other at a stone table under a tree, brewing tea around a brazier.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Su Yu's environment here, a hint of envy flashed in Su Zhi's eyes as she said, "If the sect didn't prohibit it, I would want to stay at the sect's branch in Bai Yue Immortal City."</p><p></p><p>"Then I could find a small house to take you in, without having to bother with all the troubles of the outside world. How perfect that would be."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu looked at her helplessly and said, "Sister, I'm not neglecting the family."</p><p></p><p>"If there's any news or letters from the family, I'm paying attention."</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi let out a soft sigh and said, "I'm not saying you're hiding here neglecting the family, I just—feel a bit tired."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu frowned, "What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi pondered for a moment and said, "Before I came to Bai Yue Immortal City, the Sect Master summoned me and Si Si, wanting us to agree to a marriage alliance with the Jiang Family and the Huang Family to maintain the sect's regional stability."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Yu's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>A marriage alliance—</p><p></p><p>The prestigious Cloud Sword Sect's Sect Master actually urged two Foundation Establishment female cultivators to agree to marry into two cultivator families?! Does he still want his face?</p><p></p><p>"How shameless and unreasonable!" Su Yu angrily mocked.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Su Yu knew the Cloud Sword Sect's fortunes had dwindled. The Sect Master even wanted to curry favor with two subordinate cultivator families.</p><p></p><p>Such a sect would not last long. Thinking of this, Su Yu couldn't help but feel relieved that he previously failed the entrance disciple test and didn't join.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would truly feel disgusted.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu then asked in succession, "What about the Elder? What did your sect's Elder say?"</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi said, "The Elder had a huge argument with the Sect Master. Now the atmosphere within the sect has completely changed. Even the outer disciples are being forced to take sides."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Su Zhi massaged her brow, looking a bit weary as she said, "With Elder and Senior Sister Luo there, the sect can't force us."</p><p></p><p>"But not long ago, the Jiang Family and Huang Family jointly intervened in the Feng City Bai Family's affairs."</p><p></p><p>"The Bai Family has already taken back the resource area we previously seized, with the support of those two families."</p><p></p><p>"This is just the beginning."  </p><p></p><p>"Next time, they may go after the Purple Gold Sand Spirit Mine."</p><p></p><p>"Unless we choose to submit."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's expression changed again. The Jiang Family and Huang Family joining forces—it was clear their intention was not about the Feng City Bai Family's resource area or the Purple Gold Sand Spirit Mine, but rather to force the Su Family and Chen Family into submission and servitude.</p><p></p><p>Damn.</p><p></p><p>Previously when he didn't know, it was fine, but now that Su Yu knew this information, he felt an unprecedented pressure weighing on his heart, making it difficult to breathe.</p><p></p><p>It was hard to imagine the immense pressure Su Zhi and Great-Granduncle Su Bin had been enduring to support the family.</p><p></p><p>After a silent moment, a fierce glint flashed in Su Yu's eyes as he said, "Sister, we cannot let the Void Spirit Fruit at this auction slip away!"</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The cultivation world has always valued strength above all else. The strong devouring the weak is very normal and common. </p><p></p><p>The current situation of the Su family and Chen family is still alright, at least they have the support of the great elder of the Cloud Sword Sect behind them.</p><p></p><p>The Jiang family and Huang family are more or less apprehensive about this, not daring to really run amok. </p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, the Su family has no choice but to enhance their strength as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Only with strength can the Su family have room to speak and make choices.</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi nodded slightly and said, "However, after obtaining the Ethereal Fruit, we still lack two core materials. Afterwards, we still need to find a second-grade pill refiner who can refine the Foundation Establishment Pill."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu said, "One more is needed, the Pure Demonic Nucleus. I have the Ice Heart Lotus."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Zhi was stunned. The Ice Heart Lotus was also very rare. She did not expect that Su Yu had only recently arrived in Bai Yue Immortal City, yet he had already collected the Ice Heart Lotus.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Su Yu said again, "As for the Foundation Establishment Pill, I can refine it myself."</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi's beautiful eyes widened, looking at Su Yu with surprise and joy, "You, you have advanced to the second-grade junior pill refiner?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu nodded, and Su Zhi exclaimed happily, "Good, good, so good! Father and the others will definitely be very happy if they know."</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because she knew Su Yu was a second-grade junior pill refiner, she was delighted. Su Zhi took Su Yu out to buy some spirit wine, then personally cooked some delicious food when they returned, and the two siblings celebrated properly.</p><p></p><p>By the end of the drinking, even Su Zhi, who was at the Foundation Establishment realm, was slightly intoxicated, leaning against the stone table. Her chest was illuminated by the slanting moonlight, her eyes half-dazed with peach blossom wine, her face flushed red as she murmured something, looking pitiful.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, Su Yu was still fine, although he felt a bit dizzy.</p><p></p><p>However, the tenth layer of his Body Refining Technique made his body exceptionally strong, allowing him to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the drunken Su Zhi, Su Yu shook his head slightly, carried her to the room he had prepared earlier, and let her rest properly.</p><p></p><p>Back in the courtyard, Su Yu poured himself a drink, looked up at the starry sky, and his gaze became extraordinarily sharp.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu murmured softly, "Jiang family, Huang family... wait, I'll have time, just you wait."</p><p></p><p>"And the White family of Maple City—heh, they dare to jump out and make a fuss."</p><p></p><p>Finally, Su Yu drank away all the pressure and returned to his own room to rest.</p><p></p><p>As the Bai Yue Immortal City's Lingdian Auction approached, more and more cultivators from all directions came here, and the streets outside became lively.</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi temporarily stayed in Su Yu's courtyard. When she learned that a pair of cultivating sisters lived opposite Su Yu, she went to visit them, only to find out they were a pair of cultivating sisters, immediately feeling greatly disappointed.</p><p></p><p>However, the Lan Xi and Lan Gong sisters were extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>Damn, behind Su Daoyou was actually a Foundation Establishment sister? How terrifying.</p><p></p><p>As such, the Lan Xi and Lan Gong sisters' gazes towards Su Yu became more ardent, and their attitudes towards him became more respectful and ingratiating.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu and Su Zhi arrived at the Lingdian located in the central market of the inner domain, using the Cloud Sword Sect's token to enter and receive a small private room on the second floor.</p><p></p><p>From the small private room on the second floor, they looked down at the enormous auction hall below. Even though only cultivators with at least one thousand low-grade spirit stones were qualified to enter, there were still hundreds or even thousands of cultivators below.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, the auction officially began.</p><p></p><p>The opening item was a set of cultivation techniques for a second-grade junior pill refiner, with a starting bid of one thousand low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>After a round of bidding, it was eventually won by an old man in the main hall on the first floor for two thousand six hundred low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, there were many complicated item auctions, some of which made Su Yu and Su Zhi feel tempted, but neither of them made a move.</p><p></p><p>Until a second-grade mid-tier earth-attributed demonic nucleus appeared, Su Yu's expression immediately brightened with joy.</p><p></p><p>The core material for the Dragon Alligator Puppet Beast, obtained!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

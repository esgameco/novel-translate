        <h1>Chapter 55</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Fire and metal attribute yao-core pellets are the most popular, and their prices are also high. However, if you want them, I can prepare them for you with 2,200 low-grade spirit stones," Yuzhe'er looked at Su Yu. </p><p></p><p>Su Yu pondered for a moment.</p><p></p><p>2,200 low-grade spirit stones—</p><p></p><p>He didn't have enough spirit stones on hand. </p><p></p><p>Throughout this year, he hadn't had much income, still familiarizing himself with Bai Yue Xian City, only expenses without income.</p><p></p><p>He was still purchasing large quantities of materials for refining second-grade low-rank dragon alligator puppet beasts.</p><p></p><p>Now, he only had less than 2,000 low-grade spirit stones on hand.</p><p></p><p>So after thinking for a moment, Su Yu waved his hand, taking out the dragon eagle puppet beast, and said to Yuzhe'er: "This is a top-notch first-grade puppet beast, almost invincible at the first grade. Even against those at the Foundation Establishment realm, it should be able to fight for a few rounds."</p><p></p><p>"Does Miss Yu need this puppet beast?"</p><p></p><p>Half a day later.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu left Yu Family's Beast Taming Shop, slightly relieved but also sighing.</p><p></p><p>He sold the dragon eagle puppet beast to Yuzhe'er for 6,000 low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Deducting the price of the two pellets, he still had 3,800 left.</p><p></p><p>Adding to the spirit stones he had on hand, he now had a total of over 5,600.</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully, I can successfully break through to the second grade," Su Yu murmured softly.</p><p></p><p>As for why he sold the dragon eagle puppet beast—</p><p></p><p>First, he lacked money.</p><p></p><p>Second, his Body Refining Technique was about to break through to the tenth level. At that time, the strength of his physical body would surpass that of the dragon eagle puppet beast.</p><p></p><p>He no longer needed the dragon eagle puppet beast for protection.</p><p></p><p>Selling it to the Yu Family in exchange for enough spirit stones and resources, while also seeking an opportunity for the Earth Fire Ape and Black Scale Eagle to break through to the second-grade yao beast, was worth it.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for about half a month.</p><p></p><p>Yuzhe'er finally prepared the two yao-core pellets. Originally, Su Yu planned to go get them himself, but Yuzhe'er brought the pellets to his courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Yuzhe'er snorted arrogantly: "I'm a second-grade low-rank beast tamer. In case of any accident, I might be able to keep an eye on things for you."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu cupped his hands and said, "Oh, it's Senior Yu. My apologies."</p><p></p><p>In terms of status, second-grade beast tamers and puppet masters were actually equivalent to the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>So it was appropriate for the Qi Refining Su Yu to address her as "senior."</p><p></p><p>However, hearing Su Yu's teasing tone, Yuzhe'er bit her silver teeth and gave him a cold look, saying, "You really are a jerk. I misjudged you."</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and get ready. Let's see who can break through to the second grade first."</p><p></p><p>Yuzhe'er scolded.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu released his Earth Fire Ape beast, and secretly took out two perfect-quality All-Beast Pills, letting the Earth Fire Ape consume them to enhance it to its optimal state.</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>In the secret room below the chamber.</p><p></p><p>After swallowing the fire-attribute yao-core pellet, the Earth Fire Ape's body suddenly erupted with an extremely ferocious blazing aura.</p><p></p><p>Its originally shrunken two-foot-tall body now fully released its true form, a towering six to seven-foot-tall crimson ape wreathed in raging flames, standing in the center of the secret room.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!!!"</p><p></p><p>The scorching medicinal power of the second-grade yao-core pellet was released, and the ferocious strength made the Earth Fire Ape unable to resist letting out roars.</p><p></p><p>If it were an ordinary Earth Fire Ape, it would have likely lost its sanity at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Only the instinct to vent this medicinal power would remain.</p><p></p><p>However, after being nourished by the Cangmu Suilian Skill for over a decade, the Earth Fire Ape's bloodline had already undergone a metamorphosis, and its intelligence had greatly increased, making it qualitatively different from ordinary yao beasts.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, it could now control the ferocious power within its bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Beside it, Yuzhe'er said in a low voice: "Make it endure and refine the power of the pellet. Exhaust all efforts to break through the second-grade bottleneck!"</p><p></p><p>Under Su Yu's control, the Earth Fire Ape suppressed the ferocious aura of its bloodline, retaining its rationality, knowing that it was attempting to break through the bottleneck to become a second-grade yao beast.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>So besides letting out low growls and roars, the Fire Ape was using all its strength to refine the medicinal power of the elixir within its body, repeatedly attacking the bottleneck of the second-stage demonic beast realm. </p><p></p><p>Time passed in a flash.</p><p></p><p>After one hour, </p><p></p><p>The Fire Ape's aura reached its peak, accompanied by the Fire Ape's deafening roar. With a boom, the Fire Ape gathered all its accumulated strength to make one final all-out effort to break through the bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>But after one attack, the Fire Ape violently spat out a mouthful of blood, its skin bursting open, drenched in fresh blood all over its body.</p><p></p><p>Yu Zhuan's expression changed: "Oh no, its power is too violent. With the catalytic eruption of the elixir, the Fire Ape's body cannot withstand the explosive impact of this force."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Yu's figure flashed, appearing behind the Fire Ape's back. </p><p></p><p>Placing one hand on the Fire Ape's back.</p><p></p><p>"Om!"</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power of the Qingmu Suizhou Technique gushed into the Fire Ape's body.</p><p></p><p>The originally shattered bloody wounds on the Fire Ape's body instantly healed. The terrifying healing effect allowed the Fire Ape's near-collapsing physical form to repeatedly destroy and recover.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Yu's spiritual power's healing effect, Yu Zhuan next to him was utterly astonished, staring blankly.</p><p></p><p>"What technique is this!?" Yu Zhuan exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>This was pulling the Fire Ape back from the gates of the underworld, over and over again!</p><p></p><p>This continued for nearly half an hour.</p><p></p><p>When Su Yu's face turned pale and he was drenched in sweat, the Fire Ape's aura finally broke through one bottleneck with a thunderous rumble. Its violent aura exploded, surpassing the first stage realm.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>The Fire Ape let out an excited roar. The originally crimson flames surrounding its body deepened after the breakthrough, showing signs of molting from crimson to orange flames.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu retreated to the side, taking a few deep breaths. Seeing the Fire Ape's successful breakthrough, he heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, it succeeded, otherwise he would have suffered a great loss.</p><p></p><p>Yu Zhuan saw the Fire Ape successfully break through and was both delighted and envious, looking at Su Yu with a rather complex expression.</p><p></p><p>After Su Yu recovered, Yu Zhuan said, "It was able to break through thanks to the terrifying healing effect of your spiritual power."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, its breakthrough would likely have failed this time."</p><p></p><p>After breaking through, the Fire Ape's aura settled as it shrank back down to two feet tall, scampering over to Su Yu and hugging his leg while excitedly squeaking, as if grateful to its master for the help.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu looked at Yu Zhuan and blinked, "Does this make me a second-tier lower-rank beast tamer?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Zhuan glared at him, "No, being a second-tier lower-rank beast tamer doesn't mean having a second-tier lower-rank beast."</p><p></p><p>"It means being able to subdue and tame early second-tier demonic beasts in the wild with your own beast taming skills."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu understood upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>In other words, it required using beast taming arts, not simply having a lower second-tier beast under one's command.</p><p></p><p>"Let it rest for a few days, then have the Black Scale Eagle try to break through next."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu was prepared for the Black Scale Eagle to potentially fail its breakthrough attempt, but the situation the Fire Ape experienced did not occur for the Black Scale Eagle.</p><p></p><p>After consuming the Metallic Demonic Core Pellet, the Black Scale Eagle lay still, refining the medicinal power.  </p><p></p><p>Its terrifying metallic demonic aura fluctuated unsteadily.</p><p></p><p>After over an hour, the Black Scale Eagle silently erupted all its power to attack the bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>With one strike, it broke through successfully, its aura instantly exploding.</p><p></p><p>The Black Scale Eagle and Fire Ape, Su Yu's two beasts, both advanced to become early second-tier demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>P.S. Chapter 2 updated. Since the author had some friends come over for a gathering, this chapter was a bit slow. Here it is now.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

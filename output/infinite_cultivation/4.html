        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The matter of body refinement arts, Su Yu did not mention it to anyone, including the higher ranks of the family. Perhaps if he spoke of it, he could obtain better and more resources from the family, but along with gaining resources, the responsibilities and matters on his shoulders would also increase. </p><p></p><p>The dangers would multiply as well, which would be very unfavorable for a novice cultivator just starting on the path of immortality.</p><p></p><p>Don't forget.</p><p></p><p>Besides their cultivating Su Family in Jiangcheng, there was also the Lin Family. </p><p></p><p>The Lin Family was quite formidable against their Su Family.</p><p></p><p>In previous cultivation games, someone had calculated the probability of ultimately becoming an immortal by taking the high-profile genius cultivation path versus the low-key path.</p><p></p><p>The ratio of the former to the latter was about one to nine.</p><p></p><p>In other words, those who cultivated in a high-profile way and made it to the end were only one-ninth of those who cultivated lowkey.</p><p></p><p>Compared to obtaining a small amount of cultivation resources from the family, Su Yu would rather cultivate lowkey and slowly build up his skills.</p><p></p><p>He would absolutely not leave the family until his strength was built up.</p><p></p><p>Three months after returning from Cloudswod Sect, the neighboring Su Qingyi broke through to the second level of Qi Refinement Realm. </p><p></p><p>After inviting Su Yu for a meal to boast, Su Qingyi chose to go to one of the Su Family's herb fields to become an apprentice pharmacist and learn to cultivate spirit herbs and analyze their medicinal properties.</p><p></p><p>This was the first step to becoming a pill refinement apprentice.</p><p></p><p>At the second level of Qi Refinement Realm, he could receive two low-grade spirit stones and fifty pounds of spirit rice as a monthly allowance from the family.</p><p></p><p>Plus by going to the herb fields as a pharmacist apprentice, he could receive another two low-grade spirit stones per month.</p><p></p><p>These resources were quite considerable.</p><p></p><p>At least compared to Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation speed of a mid-grade spirit root is really fast," Su Yu sighed inwardly. Breaking through to the second level of Qi Refinement in just three months.</p><p></p><p>This rate of advancement could even rival that of a top-grade spirit root.</p><p></p><p>After drinking up the fine wine left behind by Su Qingyi, Su Yu shook his head lightly and settled his heart to continue his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing every day was to cultivate the Willow Green Wood Mantra.</p><p></p><p>This wood-attribute technique was not powerful in its energy, and its cultivation speed was slow. But it excelled in being peaceful and full-bodied, even having effects of healing injuries and prolonging life.</p><p></p><p>When cultivated to the ninth level of mastery, it could extend one's lifespan by at least twenty years while in the Qi Refinement Realm.</p><p></p><p>Those twenty years of lifespan were quite attractive to many people, so there were not few in the Su Family who cultivated the Willow Green Wood Mantra.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Su Family's ability to rise up was closely related to the Willow Green Wood Mantra.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Su Family's main business was cultivating spirit herbs, and the energy of the Willow Green Wood Mantra was very helpful for the growth of spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>Every day, he would cultivate the Willow Green Wood Mantra for four hours to the limit.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he would practice the Wood Vine Technique and Spirit Nurturing Technique, which were both entry-level spells.</p><p></p><p>The Wood Vine Technique was mainly used to restrain enemies, while the Spirit Nurturing Technique was used to cultivate spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>Improving his proficiency in them was not difficult. Over the past few months, his proficiency in these two techniques was nearing perfection at one hundred percent.</p><p></p><p>"I need to find another spell to cultivate," Su Yu thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>But there was no rush.</p><p></p><p>At another trade fair in the clan, Su Yu brought the maid Lingdong along to wander around.</p><p></p><p>At the trade fair, Su Yu found a wood-attribute spell that suited his interests: the Spirit Javelin Technique.</p><p></p><p>The trading price was not high, only one low-grade spirit stone.</p><p></p><p>This technique could condense spiritual energy into a javelin to pierce through the air and kill enemies. Combined with the Wood Vine Technique, it could have wondrous effects.</p><p></p><p>Although Su Yu did not have many spirit stones, he still traded for this technique.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go back."</p><p></p><p>Without the low-grade spirit stone for this month, there was naturally no need to look at the remaining stalls. Su Yu returned to his courtyard and diligently practiced the Spirit Javelin Technique.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Spirit Javelin Technique was completely related to one's own spiritual energy. The more spiritual energy you infused, the stronger the javelin you could condense would be.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>But the more spiritual power was consumed.</p><p></p><p>"For the time being, having this offensive spell at the first level of Qi Refining is enough," Su Yu was very satisfied. If his strength was insufficient, he would never be greedy for more.</p><p></p><p>Time passed slowly. </p><p></p><p>The stars shifted positions.</p><p></p><p>Spring departed, autumn arrived.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>It had been a year since Su Yu returned from the Cloudsword Sect. During this year, besides cultivating, Su Yu would wander around the Archives Pavilion and the various markets in Jiangcheng city.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes he would go find Fifth Grandpa Su Bin for casual chats, learning from Su Bin's mouth many interesting stories about the cultivation world.  </p><p></p><p>This old man occupied a rather special position in the family. Normally, apart from staying in the Archives Pavilion, he would occasionally disappear without a trace, and no one knew where he went.</p><p></p><p>The other elders of the family, even the family lord, all ignored his wandering and idleness.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu had asked the old man about it before, but Su Bin only laughed and told the little brat not to be so inquisitive.</p><p></p><p>On this day, while Su Yu was cultivating, a blue radiance flashed from his body and his spiritual power surged.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation base finally broke through from the first level of Qi Refining to the second level.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through, Su Yu did not conceal it and went to show the second elder his new cultivation level, receiving a reward for breaking through to the second level of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>Double the monthly allowance, which was one low-grade spirit stone and thirty pounds of low-grade spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>Apart from this, for his future monthly allowance at the second level of Qi Refining, it would be two low-grade spirit stones and fifty pounds of low-grade spirit rice each month.</p><p></p><p>Taking a year to break through from the first to the second level of Qi Refining, his talent was considered bottom-tier.</p><p></p><p>It would not attract any attention at all.</p><p></p><p>Even if someone knew that Su Yu had broken through to the second level of Qi Refining, they would only shake their heads. Taking a year to break through, what a waste of talent. Then they would immediately forget about Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Dong was very happy that Su Yu's cultivation had improved and specially made him a delicious meal. The two celebrated a little in their courtyard.</p><p></p><p>At another trade fair in the sect, Su Yu saw many demonic beast essence bloods being sold at the stalls, including some from early stage first-level demonic beasts, as well as a few drops from mid-stage first-level demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>"So much demonic beast essence blood? Did the medicine fields experience a small demonic beast stampede?" Su Yu wondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He used a low-grade spirit stone he had saved to buy two drops of the mid-stage first-level demonic beast essence blood. After wandering around the trade fair, he did not see Fifth Elder Su Bin, though he had wanted to ask him about this matter. Since he could not find him, he could only give up and leave.</p><p></p><p>Half a year ago, Su Yu had broken through to the second level of his Body Refining technique.</p><p></p><p>After half a year of cultivation, a month ago he had broken through to the third level of the Body Refining technique.</p><p></p><p>Back in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu focused his mind, and lines of text appeared.</p><p></p><p>【Name: Su Yu.】</p><p>【Cultivation: Second Level of Qi Refining.】 </p><p>【Longevity: 17/99.】</p><p>【Techniques: Willow Green Wood Mantra (Second Level, Proficiency 1.42%), Alligator One Hundred Eight Form Body Refining (Third Level, Proficiency 10.67%).】</p><p>【Spells: Wood Vine Technique (Mastered), Spirit Nurturing Technique (Mastered), Spirit Javelin Technique (Mastered).】</p><p></p><p>"With the two drops of mid-stage first-level demonic beast essence blood, I should try to break through to the fourth level of the Body Refining technique within two to three months," Su Yu pondered while looking at the proficiency panel.</p><p></p><p>As for spells, after accumulating some spirit stones, he could look into whether there were any more powerful spells suitable for him.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps he should consider taking up pill refining or talisman crafting as side occupations?</p><p></p><p>With the proficiency panel, it would be a huge waste not to spend his free time improving side occupations to earn some pocket money.</p><p></p><p>"Pill refining, artifact forging, talisman crafting, array formation and so on, these side occupations can all earn good money," Su Yu pondered as his eyes flickered slightly.</p><p></p><p>With money, he could greatly increase the speed of his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

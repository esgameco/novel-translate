        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the doubts in his mind that he couldn't figure out, Su Yu began to focus on cultivating seriously. </p><p></p><p>He had Ling Dong cook up half a jin of spirit rice at noon. After eating the spirit rice, Su Yu borrowed the faint spiritual qi from the rice and sat cross-legged under a tree in the courtyard. He calmed his mind and cultivated the Wutong Qingmu Technique.</p><p></p><p>'The spiritual qi is a bit thin. Although a spirit-gathering array has been laid in the manor, and this place has the richest spiritual qi in the vicinity, it still can't compare to the blessed lands of major sects.'</p><p></p><p>Carefully sensing his own cultivation speed, Su Yu shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Su Family's strength was still a bit too weak. </p><p></p><p>They didn't even have a low-grade spirit vein of their own.</p><p></p><p>If they had a low-grade spirit vein, his cultivation speed would probably increase two to three times.</p><p></p><p>For now, in this environment of thin spiritual qi, he could only cultivate by relying on the spiritual qi from the spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, nourished by the spiritual qi of the spirit rice, Su Yu's cultivation speed did improve a little bit.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he needed to cultivate for more than four hours a day to reach his limit, but after taking the spirit rice, he only needed to cultivate for less than four hours each day.</p><p></p><p>The next day, the first layer of the Wutong Qingmu Technique's proficiency increased to 1.88%.</p><p></p><p>An increase of about 0.28% compared to the previous day.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, it would take him a year to reach the second level of Qi Condensation Realm.</p><p></p><p>Because he had just embarked on the path of cultivation, Su Yu temporarily had no duties arranged in the clan. He only needed to cultivate diligently every day and could receive a monthly allowance of spirit stones and spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>"Let me try a low-grade spirit stone." Su Yu couldn't help but use the only low-grade spirit stone he had to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Five days passed, and Su Yu's cultivation speed doubled.</p><p></p><p>No, it should be said that the rate of increase in the Wutong Qingmu Technique's proficiency doubled.</p><p></p><p>In five days, the proficiency went from the original 1.88% to 4.7%.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Wutong Qingmu Technique within his body grew a lot.</p><p></p><p>It was just a pity that after five days, the spiritual qi of that low-grade spirit stone was completely exhausted. Without the spirit stone, he could only cultivate by relying on spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation speed decreased greatly.</p><p></p><p>"It's still more comfortable to use spirit stones," Su Yu felt a bit uncomfortable but quickly adjusted himself.</p><p></p><p>It will just be slower, as long as the proficiency can increase, it's fine. No need to rush.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was only sixteen years old and still had decades of lifespan left. If he steadily cultivated, he should have the opportunity to succeed in forming his Foundation.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he would have two hundred years of lifespan and could then try to seek the opportunity to form his Golden Core...</p><p></p><p>By being prudent, becoming a Realized Being was within reach!</p><p></p><p>The days passed peacefully. In addition to cultivating, Su Yu also diligently practiced the two spell techniques he had.</p><p></p><p>Increasing the proficiency of spell techniques was much easier than for martial arts. By cultivating them diligently morning and night, their proficiency quickly rose above 10%.</p><p></p><p>Without needing to oversee the clan's affairs, Su Yu's days were very fulfilling, cultivating his martial arts and spell techniques like clockwork every single day.</p><p></p><p>One day, during his free time, Su Yu went to the clan's library and looked through various books about the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>'The Thousand-Year Rise and Fall of Cloud Sword Sect'.</p><p>'The Untold Secrets of the Great Ming Manor and the Great Ming Palace'.</p><p>'Observations from Worship Moon Immortal City'.</p><p>'Eccentric Figures and Strange Events of the Great Qian Cultivation World'.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the founding patriarch of Cloud Sword Sect, Sword Immortal Cloud Sword, was an exceptionally beautiful sword immortal who once leveled a mountain with a single sword strike when establishing the sect's mountain gate."</p><p></p><p>"Five hundred years ago, a peerless genius disciple emerged from Cloud Sword Sect, reaching the Golden Core Realized Being realm at only sixty years of age, leading the sect to its peak. However, a hundred years later, this disciple was severely injured and perished without apparent cause, rumored to have challenged a Yuan Ying expert from Great Moon Palace."</p><p></p><p>"The inheritance of Great Moon Palace is shrouded in secrecy. It is said that at the core of Great Moon Palace lies a blessed land called the Great Moon Lake Paradise, where one day of cultivation equals a thousand years outside."  </p><p></p><p>"The lifelong aspiration of Realized Being Worship Moon was apparently a legendary figure from Great Moon Palace."</p><p></p><p>Most of these books recorded idle hearsay and common knowledge about the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>There were also many rumors about influential figures, especially the past romantic affairs of Realized Being Worship Moon. Su Yu found them quite fascinating to read, though unfortunately there were no sequels.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>For half a month straight, whenever Su Yu had free time, he would come to the Classics Pavilion and stay for a while. </p><p></p><p>On this day, he saw an old and tattered book of classics.</p><p></p><p>"Eh, the 108 Body Refining Techniques of the Alligator Demon?" Seeing the record on this tattered classic, Su Yu's heart stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>In the game, cultivation techniques were the most premium and important foundation for cultivators. </p><p></p><p>But apart from cultivation techniques, body refining was also not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Because the ultimate goal of body refining was the ancient divine beings. In the ancient era of the Shaman tribe, they ruled an age with the power of their physical bodies, unmatched by anyone.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the methods of body refining were not as good as cultivation, but it was hard to say which was ultimately stronger between body refining and cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if some cultivators looked down on body refining techniques, in reality, many cultivators would secretly practice body refining techniques as well.</p><p></p><p>This was because compared to the might of their magic powers, cultivators' physical bodies were a weakness.  </p><p></p><p>There were many benefits to also practicing body refining techniques.</p><p></p><p>The game character Su Yu played before had also practiced a body refining technique.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu carefully examined the "108 Body Refining Techniques of the Alligator Demon" in his hands. Only after looking at it did he understand why this body refining technique had been buried and collecting dust in the Classics Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>This body refining technique was not simple - it originated from an ancient giant alligator demon.</p><p></p><p>The body refining technique it created could only be practiced by those with the bloodline of that demon's tribe as the foundation.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, in this cultivation world of Jiangcheng, there was no longer any existence of that alligator demon bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, this body refining technique became obsolete.</p><p></p><p>And the body refining technique in Su Yu's hands only had the first eighteen techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, little Yu found this body refining technique? Are you tempted?" An elderly voice came from behind. "It's a pity, in the past we tried many times, and even spent a great effort to obtain the essence blood of an alligator demon to try cultivating it."</p><p></p><p>"But in the end, none of us succeeded. This body refining technique is not only possessed by our Su Family, but also by other cultivation forces."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that over so many years, I haven't heard of anyone who could successfully cultivate it."</p><p></p><p>"That bloodline of the Alligator Demon tribe has probably gone extinct."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu turned around, and it was the fifth elder of the clan, Su Bin, an elder whose temples were already graying and whose cultivation had reached the seventh level of the Refining Qi realm.</p><p></p><p>It was said that this Classics Pavilion was built solely by the efforts of the fifth elder Su Bin. Most of the classics here were collected by him at great effort and expense, in order to broaden the knowledge and experience of the younger generation in the clan.</p><p></p><p>"Fifth Grandfather." So Su Yu respectfully bowed, being very respectful towards this elder.</p><p></p><p>Then, Su Yu hesitated and said, "I don't know if I can borrow this body refining technique for a period of time?"</p><p></p><p>Su Bin smiled, "You can, but if you try cultivating it and fail, then don't waste any more effort on it. The most important thing is still the cultivation of your own techniques."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Fifth Grandfather," Su Yu said happily.</p><p></p><p>After seeing this body refining technique, Su Yu had no desire to look at the other classics, and immediately left with the "108 Body Refining Techniques of the Alligator Demon."</p><p></p><p>Back in his own courtyard, Su Yu carefully studied this body refining technique.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't have the so-called Alligator Demon bloodline as a foundation, he still silently began practicing the first eighteen techniques of the body refining technique according to the records.</p><p></p><p>Ten days passed.</p><p></p><p>Apart from diligently cultivating the Willow Green Wood Technique and magic spells, Su Yu spent his spare time practicing the Alligator Demon Body Refining Technique.</p><p></p><p>On this day, accompanied by a thunderous sound from his body, Su Yu felt as if his blood energy was boiling like molten lava, extremely scorching hot.</p><p></p><p>His skin, flesh, and bones were all shedding and transforming. Vaguely, the surging blood energy within his body converged into the true form of a giant alligator, enveloped in a bloody aura, like a demon. At the moment the giant alligator formed, it let out a sky-shattering roar.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu was greatly alarmed. Blood runes emerged on the surface of his skin, and an immense force welled up within his body, giving him the illusion that he could shatter mountains with a single punch.</p><p></p><p>[Technique: Alligator Demon 108 Body Refining Techniques (First Layer, Proficiency 0.1%).]</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

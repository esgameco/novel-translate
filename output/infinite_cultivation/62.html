        <h1>Chapter 62</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>That second-grade mid-tier earth-attribute demon core, Suyu spent one thousand three hundred low-grade spirit stones to win the bid. Afterwards, she saw a set of scales and sharp claws appear, and Suyu bid on all of them. </p><p></p><p>In total, she spent less than two thousand low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"The materials for a second-grade low-tier dragon alligator puppet beast are complete," Suyu breathed a sigh of relief inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The pill refiner and talisman master had already advanced to the second-grade low-tier, only the puppet beast had been unable to gather the materials for a second-grade puppet beast.</p><p></p><p>This showed how scarce these materials were.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Spiritual Hall auction at Baiyue Immortal City that happened once every five years allowed her to gather the materials.</p><p></p><p>In a private room on the third floor, Yuzhuan'er heard Suyu's bidding voice and looked towards the private room on the second floor.</p><p></p><p>Beside her, a middle-aged man with an imposing presence looked leisurely at the auction floor below and said, "What's wrong, do you know them?"</p><p></p><p>Yuzhuan'er nodded slightly, "Mm."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man said, "Your great uncle mentioned something to you, have you considered it? That person also comes from a major clan, and is even an inner disciple of the Great Moon Palace."</p><p></p><p>"If you marry into that family, you won't be at a disadvantage."</p><p></p><p>Yuzhuan'er's expression turned cold, "I've said it, I'd rather die than marry."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man's expression didn't change as he sighed, "Zhuan'er, it's not that your father doesn't understand you, it's just that you're at that age now."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, sometimes things don't go as we wish, but what can we do about it?"</p><p></p><p>"You're the daughter of the Yu family, the clan has nurtured you until now, you have no choice."</p><p></p><p>Yuzhuan'er didn't say anything, but her expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man said, "The old patriarch of Cloud Sword Sect has at most twenty or thirty more years, after that, Cloud Sword Sect will inevitably fall into chaos."</p><p></p><p>"This is a huge piece of meat, there will definitely be no shortage of people eyeing it - Baiyue Immortal City, Kaiyang Palace, the Qin family of Sword City, even the Great Moon Palace."</p><p></p><p>"Our Yu family is not as stable as you imagine. In such a changing situation, our Yu family must be prepared to deal with any contingencies."</p><p></p><p>Yuzhuan'er's expression changed slightly again. From these few words, it was evident that under the surface, the territorial struggles around Cloud Sword Sect were already raging.</p><p></p><p>Being in the midst of it, even a cultivator clan like the Yu family could not remain unaffected.</p><p></p><p>One small misstep, and it could mean a bottomless abyss.</p><p></p><p>Yuzhuan'er remained silent, and the middle-aged man didn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, down on the auction floor, the auctioneer had someone bring out a jade case. Upon opening it, there was an empty spirit fruit inside.</p><p></p><p>"The empty spirit fruit, a core ingredient for refining the Foundation Establishment Pill. Starting bid is one thousand low-grade spirit stones, each raise must be at least one hundred low-grade spirit stones," the enthusiastic auctioneer called out. "Now we begin the auction."</p><p></p><p>"One thousand five hundred!"  </p><p></p><p>"One thousand six hundred!"</p><p></p><p>"Two thousand!"</p><p></p><p>There were many people bidding on the first floor.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the price of the empty spirit fruit had already surpassed two thousand low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>At this price range, most of the people who had initially bid had already dropped out of the competition. </p><p></p><p>Only some on the second and third floors were still vying for it.</p><p></p><p>The price continued climbing, quickly reaching three thousand low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"Three thousand six hundred," Suyu bid for the first time.</p><p></p><p>A young man in a private room on the third floor frowned slightly, following with a bid of three thousand seven hundred low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Suyu raised again to three thousand eight hundred, and only then did the young man give up.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations friend, you've won the empty spirit fruit for three thousand eight hundred low-grade spirit stones," the auctioneer called out loudly.</p><p></p><p>He then began the auction for the second empty spirit fruit.</p><p></p><p>This time, Suyu did not bid again.  </p><p></p><p>With only two empty spirit fruits, if she bid for both it would be too conspicuous and draw unwanted attention.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>The auctioneer had someone bring out a second-grade low-tier pure water-attribute demon core from a Xuanjia Tortoise demon beast.</p><p></p><p>Both Suyu and Suzhi were very pleasantly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He finally bid 2,300 low-grade spirit stones to obtain it. </p><p></p><p>The finale item auctioned at this auction session was a semi-finished product (half-finished) spirit weapon called the Shadow God Halberd. It was obtained by a pseudo-pill formation cultivator on the third floor for 6,900 low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Generally, high-grade spirit weapons cost between 1,000 to 3,000 low-grade spirit stones. </p><p></p><p>They are suitable for Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p></p><p>As for supreme-grade spirit weapons, they are suitable for pill formation True Men.</p><p></p><p>For a half-finished supreme-grade spirit weapon, if one could find a skilled third-rank refiner, there might be a chance to upgrade it into a true supreme-grade spirit weapon.</p><p></p><p>Such items were currently out of reach for Su Yu and Su Zhi to even look at.</p><p></p><p>Apart from obtaining materials to refine a Dragon Alligator puppet beast and Foundation Establishment pills, Su Yu also spent 900 low-grade spirit stones to acquire an earth attribute cultivation technique that could be practiced up to the fourth level of Foundation Establishment.  </p><p></p><p>For Su Yu, this technique would suffice for the time being.</p><p></p><p>He planned to cultivate his earth spiritual root during his free time.</p><p></p><p>Body refining techniques could enhance his defensive capabilities, and earth spiritual power could also improve his defenses.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the powerful healing effects of the wood attribute Cyan Wood Yearly Cycle technique, his ability to preserve his life would be quite formidable.</p><p></p><p>They left the Spirit Hall early, handed over the low-grade spirit stones, took the items they had acquired, and Su Yu and Su Zhi immediately returned to the courtyard residence.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I will seclude myself to refine the Foundation Establishment pill," said Su Yu, taking a deep breath with some pressure.</p><p></p><p>A single batch of Foundation Establishment pill materials cost nearly 10,000 low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>How could ordinary cultivators and cultivation families afford such an expense?</p><p></p><p>Without resources and the spirit plant materials to refine Foundation Establishment pills, the path to reaching the Foundation Establishment realm would forever be blocked for them.</p><p></p><p>He could not fail in refining this batch of Foundation Establishment pill materials.</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi said, "Go ahead, I'll protect your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Then she smiled, "Don't feel pressured. Even if you fail, it'll just be practice for my brother. It's not a loss."</p><p></p><p>In the secret room.</p><p></p><p>For several consecutive days, Su Yu spent time adjusting his state, refining a batch of second-grade low-rank spirit pills each day.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later, a batch of perfectly refined second-grade low-rank Spirit Opening Pills emerged from the furnace, totaling five pills.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this batch of perfectly refined second-grade low-rank Spirit Opening Pills come out, Su Yu was overjoyed and his confidence soared. </p><p></p><p>The perfect state he had been awaiting finally arrived, and the opportunity presented itself.</p><p></p><p>"Begin refining the Foundation Establishment Pill."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu calmed his mind and spirit, composedly starting the furnace and beginning to refine from the ordinary materials. As time passed bit by bit...</p><p></p><p>A day later, Su Yu began melting the core materials.</p><p></p><p>After the Ice Heart Lotus, Void Spirit Fruit, and Pure Demonic Core melted, Su Yu began the final pill condensation stage.</p><p></p><p>Around two hours later...</p><p></p><p>Su Yu executed the Pill Retrieving Incantation, and four pills flew out from the refining furnace, two as pure as jade and two of ordinary quality.</p><p></p><p>Seeing these four finished Foundation Establishment Pills, Su Yu's expression brightened with delight, "Two high-grade quality, two ordinary quality."</p><p></p><p>This result exceeded his expectations, leaving him greatly satisfied.</p><p></p><p>The high-grade Foundation Establishment Pills could at least increase the success rate by 20-30%, valued at no less than 10,000 low-grade spirit stones each.</p><p></p><p>The ordinary quality ones should increase the rate by around 20%, valued at about 8,000 low-grade spirit stones each.</p><p></p><p>This batch of Foundation Establishment Pills was worth 36,000 low-grade spirit stones in total.</p><p></p><p>He carefully stored the four Foundation Establishment Pills in separate jade boxes, then placed them in a jade case with restrictive spells.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu walked out of the secret room. Su Zhi, who had been protecting his cultivation outside, was startled and just about to ask the results when she saw the jade case Su Yu handed over.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu calmly smiled, "Fortunately, I did not disgrace myself. One batch yielded four pills - two high-grade and two ordinary quality."</p><p></p><p>"Wh...what?" Su Zhi's delicate face paled as the hand she had extended trembled and withdrew. She exclaimed in shock, "High-grade quality!? Two of them!?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

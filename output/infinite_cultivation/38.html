        <h1>Chapter 38</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Miss Yu, long time no see." Su Yu looked at Yu Ke'er with a hint of surprise in his eyes. Yu Ke'er was around the same age as him, but her cultivation had already reached the eighth level of Qi Refining, and she was also a first-grade superior Beast Taming Master. </p><p></p><p>This young lady of the Yu Family from Black Rock Mountain truly lived up to the name of a renowned Beast Taming family.</p><p></p><p>Yu Ke'er wrinkled her nose and sized up Su Yu for a moment: "You're still just a first-grade superior Pill Refining Master?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu, this pill refining genius, had gained a bit of fame in the market town, so it was normal for Yu Ke'er to know about it.</p><p></p><p>However, Yu Ke'er still didn't quite believe it. How could someone with such a low cultivation level like Su Yu be a first-grade superior Pill Refining Master?</p><p></p><p>Su Yu smiled and said, "Miss Yu, did you need something from me?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Yu change the subject, Yu Ke'er couldn't help but let out a light snort and said, "I need Mind Bewildering Liquid, ten bottles. But your price is too high, you'll have to give me a discount."</p><p></p><p>Ten bottles of Mind Bewildering Liquid? Su Yu's expression tensed. What did the Yu Family need so much Mind Bewildering Liquid for?</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu gave Yu Ke'er a 20% discount, 160 low-grade spirit stones per bottle. Previously, Yu Ke'er had given him an auction token from the Cloud Mountain Market Town auction, and his Su Family had won a Foundation Establishment Pill.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Elder had broken through to the Foundation Establishment Realm because of this, and this cause and effect needed to be repaid.</p><p></p><p>"Do you offer a 20% discount on other pills as well?" Yu Ke'er's eyes flashed with a hint of slyness as she took out a list and handed it to Su Yu, saying, "This is the list of pills the Yu Family needs. How many can you provide?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu took the list and glanced at it, immediately feeling stunned.</p><p></p><p>This quantity would probably keep the Pill Pavilion busy for an entire year.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu looked at Yu Ke'er in shock and said, "Miss Yu, why does your family need so many pills?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Ke'er hesitated for a moment, looked back at the people coming and going outside the Pill Pavilion, and chose to transmit her voice: "Recently, there have been many demonic cultivators and bandit cultivators appearing. Two cultivation families have already been annihilated because of this."</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Saber Daoist who stole the incomplete supreme-grade artifact last time has recently appeared in the Eight Demon Ridge."</p><p></p><p>"I've heard he even publicly challenged the Cloud Sword Sect, demanding they hand over his inheritance, or else he would make the Cloud Sword Sect regret it."</p><p></p><p>Sheesh!</p><p></p><p>This news was explosive.</p><p></p><p>Eight Demon Ridge!?</p><p></p><p>Su Yu felt a chill down his spine, and a cold sweat broke out. He was still shaken by the thought.</p><p></p><p>It's a good thing!</p><p></p><p>It's a good thing he didn't go investigate what secrets the Eight Demon Ridge held.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the one the Blood Saber Daoist would be looking for wouldn't be the Cloud Sword Sect, but Su Yu himself, or rather, the Su Family!</p><p></p><p>With the Su Family's current strength, they couldn't withstand the Blood Saber Daoist.</p><p></p><p>Yu Ke'er blinked and saw that Su Yu's previously calm expression had finally changed, and she even saw a hint of fear. She nodded in satisfaction. Little brat, daring to act profound in front of your elder sister.</p><p></p><p>Now you know to be afraid, don't you?</p><p></p><p>Yu Ke'er patted Su Yu's shoulder and said, "Don't be afraid, big sis will protect you."</p><p></p><p>"You'll be safe staying in the market town."</p><p></p><p>"As for these pills, take a look. If you can make them, then we'll give you the entire order."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's expression immediately turned strange as he quickly retreated a few steps, looking at this girl acting like an elder sister. He said, "This quantity is too large. A 20% discount is not possible. How about this, a 10% discount, to repay you for the auction token favor from before."</p><p></p><p>"Favor?" Yu Ke'er was stunned for a moment, looking at Su Yu's serious expression. She blinked and then smiled and nodded, "Not bad, not bad. Alright, a 10% discount then."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu added, "I estimate it will take about a year to complete the entire order."</p><p></p><p>Yu Ke'er nodded, "No problem, just deliver it once a month. I'll be staying in the market town, so you can deliver the pills to me, little brother."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu: "......"</p><p></p><p>Calling him little brother every other sentence, but in reality, based on her life aura, she seemed to be almost a year younger than him.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>That guy likes to act like the big sister!</p><p></p><p>After discussing with Su Yu, Yu Ke'er left a deposit of three thousand low-grade spirit stones before turning to leave.</p><p></p><p>Because of what Yu Ke'er said, Su Yu began paying attention to the changes in the market outside. In addition to spirit-cultivating pills, talisman papers, formation techniques, and magical artifacts all became bestsellers, especially pills and talisman papers which were the most popular and sold out.</p><p></p><p>The Su Family Pill Pavilion only kept a small portion of pills for daily sales, while the rest of the pills had been purchased by the Yu Family, including the Mind-Muddling Liquid. </p><p></p><p>The Yu Family's order from the Su Family Pill Pavilion was worth nearly ten thousand low-grade spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>After deducting costs, the Su Family could profit at least four thousand low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>The news of the Blood Saber Cultivator threatening the Cloud Sword Sect caused an uproar, and cultivators in the market were all discussing it in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the appearance of demonic cultivators and evil cultivators also made many cultivators and cultivating families anxious.</p><p></p><p>This was the fundamental reason why pills, talisman papers, formation techniques, and so on were selling out.</p><p></p><p>"A mere Foundation Establishment demonic cultivator, the Cloud Sword Sect should be able to handle it without much problem," Su Yu observed the commotion outside and decided not to go out.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the demonic cultivators and evil cultivators, the prices of talisman papers had risen sharply outside.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the price changes, Su Yu felt very tempted. As his cultivation level increased, especially after advancing to the seventh layer of his Body Refining Technique, the resources he needed for cultivation had almost doubled.</p><p></p><p>He had a great demand for essence blood of spirit beasts, and only the essence blood of peak late-stage first-grade spirit beasts could satisfy him.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, he estimated that he would need the essence blood of second-grade spirit beasts in the future.</p><p></p><p>The threat brought by the demonic cultivators and evil cultivators this time might be an opportunity for him to accumulate cultivation resources.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, after his daily cultivation, apart from refining pills for the Yu Family, Su Yu spent all his spare time drawing talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>He drew both mid-grade and high-grade first-level talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>He no longer sold them at the Pill Pavilion but secretly sold them to other merchants, supplying them.</p><p></p><p>Except for a few members of the Su Family, no one else knew that he was a high-grade first-level Talisman Master, and he had no intention of revealing it.</p><p></p><p>Time passed in a blink of an eye, and a few more months went by.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Mountain Market Auction was held again. This time, the auction attracted even more cultivators. Yu Ke'er sent someone to deliver an auction token, but neither Su Yu nor Su Yun chose to attend.</p><p></p><p>After all, during the previous auction, that Blood Saber Cultivator had caused a commotion there, snatching items and leaving unscathed.</p><p></p><p>The two of them were... well, cautious, absolutely not afraid of death.</p><p></p><p>So in the end, it was Su Jingbang, who came to the market to deliver spirit medicines, along with a few members of the Su Family who had never attended an auction before.</p><p></p><p>Although Su Yu did not participate in the auction, he secretly sent ten high-quality high-grade first-level 'Fire Dragon Talisman' to be auctioned off.</p><p></p><p>It was a new high-grade first-level talisman paper he had comprehended, modeled after the ancient Fire Dragon Talisman.</p><p></p><p>Its power was formidable. Although not as fast or armor-piercing as the Fire Cloud Arrow Talisman, the Fire Dragon Talisman had greater power and more ferocious might. Overall, there was not much difference between them, each with its own strengths.</p><p></p><p>These ten high-quality high-grade 'Fire Dragon Talismans' were auctioned off at the astonishing price of one thousand one hundred low-grade spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>Compared to before, the price had increased by as much as thirty to forty percent!</p><p></p><p>Su Jingbang and the others also had decent gains from participating in the auction. They managed to obtain two core spirit medicine ingredients for refining Foundation Establishment Pills for the family.</p><p></p><p>Although they spent nearly two thousand low-grade spirit stones, which was quite expensive, it was still worth it for a small family like the Su Family.</p><p></p><p>For a glimmer of hope to reach the Foundation Establishment realm, the Su Family was willing to spend this money.</p><p></p><p>After all, apart from the auction channel, it would be very difficult for them to collect the ingredients for Foundation Establishment Pills, requiring time, effort, and labor, with no guarantee of success.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

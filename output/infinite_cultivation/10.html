        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, Su Yu only needed less than three hours to reach the limit when practicing the Wutong Qingmu Mantra. In his spare time afterwards, he would follow Su Changyu to learn about the properties of medicines, identify spirit medicines, as well as cultivate body refining techniques and spells. </p><p></p><p>In the future, if he had free time, he might be able to cultivate this water-attribute martial art and spells.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps for other cultivators, being a jack-of-all-trades was a bad thing. </p><p></p><p>But for him, who possessed a proficiency panel and balanced spiritual roots of the five elements, being greedy was only a good thing.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivators can have longevity, as long as they are patient and don't waste their time. If I persevere for thousands or tens of thousands of years, I might become a 'Hexagonal War God'." Su Yu felt aspiration welling up, unable to stop imagining life thousands or tens of thousands of years later.</p><p></p><p>As for bottlenecks in spiritual roots and aptitude?</p><p></p><p>For the proficiency panel, there were no bottlenecks.</p><p></p><p>As long as he slowly accumulated proficiency, it would not be difficult for him to have longevity, and as long as he had longevity, he could realize his dream of becoming a 'Hexagonal War God'.</p><p></p><p>After looking at the Xuan Shui Mantra and Xuan She Technique, Su Yu put them away first, then took out a jade bottle and looked at the three Refining Qi Pills inside.</p><p></p><p>"Good stuff, just don't know what the effects are?" Su Yu felt a little expectant, as he had not taken these before.</p><p></p><p>He put them away, planning to use them tomorrow during cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Su Yu went to the courtyard to practice the body refining technique.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the 'Alligator Demon's 108 Body Refining Techniques' broke through the fourth level, the progress of the body refining technique had slowed down.</p><p></p><p>One reason was that the higher the level, the more difficult it was to cultivate. The other reason was that the effect of the early stage spirit beast essence blood on his current body refining technique was no longer significant.</p><p></p><p>By practicing the body refining technique diligently every day, his proficiency could increase by about 0.2%.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he needed late-stage spirit beast essence blood to make the body refining technique progress faster.</p><p></p><p>However, late-stage spirit beast essence blood was not easy to obtain.</p><p></p><p>At least there was none in the medicine garden or Jiangcheng City.</p><p></p><p>He might have to go to the trading markets under the Yunjianzong to buy it, and the price would definitely not be cheap.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slow."</p><p></p><p>Not long after Su Yu started practicing the body refining technique, a powerful aura suddenly approached the Su Residence, followed by an angry roar: "Su Peng, hand over the culprit who assassinated Lin Xiu, or don't blame me for being impolite!"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu immediately stopped, his expression astonished.</p><p></p><p>The Lin Family elders have come?</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu?</p><p></p><p>Was that the sneak attacker he just killed?</p><p></p><p>"He attacked me and got killed in retaliation, yet his family has the nerve to come to my door now. Hmph." Su Yu inwardly raged, keeping this score in mind.</p><p></p><p>The visitor was Lin Hai, the fourth elder of the Lin Family. The killed Lin Xiu was his grandson.</p><p></p><p>Lin Xiu's talent was not strong, but he was one of only three descendants with spiritual roots who could cultivate.</p><p></p><p>That was why Lin Xiu, at the third level of Refining Qi realm, could wander around with fifteen low-grade spirit stones and an unfinished Refining Qi Pill.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Hai led a team of Lin Family cultivators to block the entrance.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, a lazy voice came from behind them.</p><p></p><p>"Little Hai, I just went out for a bit, and you dare bring people to block my Su Family's door?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this voice, Lin Hai's face changed slightly. He turned around and saw the fifth elder of the Su Family, Su Bin, smiling and pushing past the Lin Family cultivators, walking towards him.</p><p></p><p>Lin Hai was older than Su Bin, but when Su Bin called him 'Little Hai', he was enraged: "Su Bin, your Su Family dared to kill my grandson, this matter is not over!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh."</p><p></p><p>Su Bin walked nonchalantly to Lin Hai, pushed him aside to stand in front of the Su Residence gate, then turned to look at Lin Hai.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, I forgot to ask, who killed your grandson? I need to reward that person."</p><p></p><p>Lin Hai's expression turned extremely ugly, glaring at Su Bin with killing intent, not saying a word.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Su Bin seemed stunned for a moment, then said, "Don't tell me...you don't know who killed him?"</p><p></p><p>"Then why the hell are you blocking my door!</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Su Bin flared up in rage, pointing at Lin Hai and shouting, "Get lost, or I'll kill you, you bastard. How dare some trash block the entrance to the Su family's residence?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph."</p><p></p><p>Lin Hai didn't get angry, he just gave the Su residence a cold look, then led his people away.</p><p></p><p>Blocking the entrance was not to invite humiliation, but to show the Lin family's stance. </p><p></p><p>This matter was not over!</p><p></p><p>So Lin Hai had no real intention to take action, he simply turned and led his people away.</p><p></p><p>Watching Lin Hai and the others leave, Su Bin narrowed his eyes again. A dog that bites doesn't bark - Lin Hai not taking action this time meant the Lin family was plotting something bigger. </p><p></p><p>When they truly make their move, the Su family could be in big trouble.</p><p></p><p>'Hmph, it's not like any old cat or dog can take a bite out of the Su family. If they really dare to take action, they'll have to pay the price.'</p><p></p><p>Su Bin turned and entered the Su residence.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu, with his spiritual sense, couldn't help but inwardly click his tongue after seeing this: 'The Fifth Elder really is formidable, he scolded away so many people from the Lin family.'</p><p></p><p>The next morning.</p><p></p><p>When the sun rose in the east and the purple qi came from the east, in the courtyard, Su Yu swallowed a Qi Refining Pill. Immediately, a rich spiritual energy permeated his whole body, making him feel extremely comfortable.</p><p></p><p>'It's still leaning towards the wood-attributed spiritual energy, which is very easy to refine into the power of the Willow Green Wood Technique.' Su Yu was delighted.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Su Yu immersed himself in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Two hours later, Su Yu woke up.</p><p></p><p>He focused his mind on the proficiency panel and was startled: "The Willow Green Wood Technique's proficiency increased by 0.52%?"</p><p></p><p>If he had Qi Refining Pills to aid his cultivation every day, then he could break through to the third level of the Qi Refining Realm in just half a year.</p><p></p><p>The speed would increase by twice as much, no, even more.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Taking Qi Refining Pills every day would be too extravagant.</p><p></p><p>Even Su Zhi, the young lady of the prestigious Cloud Sword Sect, could not afford such extravagant cultivation resources.</p><p></p><p>After his initial surprise, Su Yu shook his head and said, "It's better for me to accumulate proficiency slowly."</p><p></p><p>After all, he had the proficiency panel, so he didn't have any bottlenecks.</p><p></p><p>Compared to others, his cultivation speed was not slow at all, especially later on when the advantage of having no bottlenecks would become more apparent.</p><p></p><p>Others would be stuck at a bottleneck for years, decades, or even centuries, while he could advance smoothly without any obstacles.</p><p></p><p>How could they compare?</p><p></p><p>Calming his mind, Su Yu continued cultivating his body refining and spell techniques.</p><p></p><p>On the second day after Su Yu returned, Su Qing Yi learned of his return and invited him over to meet.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing Su Qing Yi, Su Yu was shocked again.</p><p></p><p>He had just heard that Su Qing Yi was ambushed and seriously injured by the Lin family. Logically, he should still be recovering from his injuries.</p><p></p><p>Yet in just a month at home, he had reached the fourth level of the Qi Refining Realm?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Yu's astonished look, Su Qing Yi smiled slightly and said, "Do you remember that ancient jade case from the Fifth Elder before? I gained a bit of opportunity from it."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu: "..."</p><p></p><p>Damn.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how to describe his feelings. That scammy 'pay-to-win' jade case, Su Qing Yi could gain opportunities from it by casually spending a low-grade spirit stone?</p><p></p><p>His luck was outrageous.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu felt a bit envious, but only envious. He also congratulated Su Qing Yi.</p><p></p><p>After all, compared to the so-called jade case opportunity, Su Yu didn't believe anyone's opportunity could match his proficiency panel.</p><p></p><p>After chatting for a while, Su Qing Yi said, "By the way, the young lady will be back in a few days. Let's see if the three of us can get together then."</p><p></p><p>"Sure."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu had no objections. After all, the three of them had participated in the Cloud Sword Sect's entrance disciple test together before.</p><p></p><p>It would be good to gather again. He also wanted to learn some information about the outside world from Su Zhi, such as about the Cloud Sword Sect and the market towns under its jurisdiction.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

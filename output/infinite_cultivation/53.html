        <h1>Chapter 53</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Su Yu brought a bottle of top-grade Refining Qi Pill to visit the Lan Xi and Lan Gong sisters. </p><p></p><p>However, it didn't take long before Su Yu came out from their courtyard with a somewhat strange expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>He always felt there was something off about the way the two sisters looked at each other. </p><p></p><p>In contrast, the way they looked at him was much more normal, polite yet distant and unfamiliar.</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, in between his cultivation, Su Yu took the opportunity to visit two other neighboring families. One was a family of four who seemed a bit simple-minded. The other was a seventy-year-old burly "uncle" who was a Refiner of Artifacts at the Qi Condensation level ninth stage. </p><p></p><p>However, these two families also seemed more or less peculiar - the man from the family of four had a tendency towards domestic violence.</p><p></p><p>As for the burly Refiner uncle next door, he was a person with an extremely fiery temper.</p><p></p><p>One day.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu saw the rumored top-grade Talisman Master neighbor who had recently joined the Main Palace of Bai Yue Immortal City, so he took the initiative to visit.</p><p></p><p>"You just moved here? You're a top-grade Pill Refiner?" Wu Yiggang was a short middle-aged man less than seven feet tall, with fair skin and a handsome appearance, though his face looked a bit sour and he had to look at people sideways.</p><p></p><p>Wu Yiggang slightly raised his head and sized up Su Yu from a 45-degree sideways angle, with an arrogant 'superior' attitude and a furrowed brow full of doubt.</p><p></p><p>It was simply because Su Yu's appearance was too youthful, not much different from a teenager in his teens.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu smiled faintly, "I'm already over forty years old, barely reaching the level of a top-grade Pill Refiner. If Daoist friend Wu needs any spirit pills in the future, you can come to me."</p><p></p><p>Wu Yiggang curled his lips in disdain, "No need, our Main Palace has countless top-grade Pill Refiners. Why would I come to you instead of them?"</p><p></p><p>However, after saying that, Wu Yiggang sized up Su Yu again and said, "You just came to Bai Yue Immortal City, why don't you join our Main Palace?"</p><p></p><p>"If you want, I can recommend you to the Deacon of our Main Palace."</p><p></p><p>"Opportunities don't come often, you should cherish this chance."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu smiled wryly and cupped his hands, "Thank you for your kindness, Daoist friend, but I have no such plans for now."</p><p></p><p>"I won't disturb you any further, farewell."</p><p></p><p>Wu Yiggang's face darkened as he watched Su Yu leave, cursing under his breath, "Hmph! A mere waste at the seventh stage of Qi Condensation, ungrateful fool!"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu returned to his own courtyard and glanced towards Wu Yiggang's courtyard diagonally across.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the other neighboring families in this alley, he shook his head with a wry smile.</p><p></p><p>It seems the Lan sisters are the most normal ones.</p><p></p><p>As for that Wu Yiggang—</p><p></p><p>He felt that if it weren't for being in Bai Yue Immortal City, with that person's offensive mouth, he absolutely wouldn't have lived until now.</p><p></p><p>"A top-grade Talisman Master of the Main Palace, so arrogant?" Su Yu narrowed his eyes, flashing a fierce gleam.</p><p></p><p>There was still one last neighbor, but in the month since Su Yu had lived in this alley, he had never seen that person appear even once. Truly mysterious.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu set up a banquet, with Chen Sisi and another acquaintance, the Cloud Sword Sect disciple Yu Qingqing, sitting across from him.</p><p></p><p>Compared to before, Yu Qingqing seemed to have gained some weight, and her aura was a bit abnormal.</p><p></p><p>Chen Sisi looked at Su Yu softly, "I knew you would come to Bai Yue Immortal City, I just didn't expect it to be this soon."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu shook his head slightly, half-truthfully, "It's not that soon. If I stayed in Cloud Mountain Town, it would be very difficult for me to reach the Foundation Establishment stage."</p><p></p><p>Chen Sisi nodded slightly upon hearing this, believing Su Yu's words.</p><p></p><p>Now that Su Yu was over forty years old, yet his cultivation was only at the seventh stage of Qi Condensation.</p><p></p><p>To reach the ninth stage of Qi Condensation, wouldn't he be sixty or seventy years old?</p><p></p><p>At that age, the possibility of breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage would be extremely slim!</p><p></p><p>Beside her, when Yu Qingqing heard about breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage, her body trembled slightly, her lips pursed, and her expression became dazed and gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Su Yu and Chen Sisi saw this and quickly changed the subject, steering the conversation towards pill refining, because half a year ago, Yu Qingqing had attempted to break through to the Foundation Establishment realm but failed due to a momentary lapse of concentration, severely injuring her yuan qi.  </p><p></p><p>Even until now, Yu Qingqing still had not recovered her previous yuan qi.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that Yu Qingqing decided to leave Yunjianzong's mountain gate and come to Baiyuexian City, temporarily leaving the inner sect's Pill Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>After chatting for a while, Chen Sisi looked at Su Yu and asked, "Do you have any plans in Baiyuexian City?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu said, "Not decided yet, I'll settle down first and then see."</p><p></p><p>Chen Sisi pondered and hesitantly said, "Why don't you temporarily become an attendant at Yunjianzong's branch here? Yunjianzong has a shop here, and Shixiong Yu is also there. The tasks are very relaxed."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu politely declined. When he was in Yunshan Town, Yunjianzong's branch there had also tried to recruit him, but he did not want to get involved with other powers.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chen Sisi said, "The materials you need are quite rare. Two years later, there will be an auction at the Spirit Palace in Baiyuexian City, perhaps you may find something there."</p><p></p><p>After bidding farewell to Chen Sisi and Yu Qingqing, Su Yu settled down to cultivate here.</p><p></p><p>The Cypress Wood Cycle Technique was not far from the eighth complete cycle. While wandering around Baiyuexian City, Su Yu focused wholeheartedly on cultivation. Apart from the pill refining requests from the Lan Xi sisters and a few neighboring forgers and a family of four, Su Yu did not engage in any other activities.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and Su Yu had already stayed in Baiyuexian City for eight months.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Su Yu would sometimes stroll through the various markets in the city, and he had collected quite a few ordinary materials for the second-grade low-rank Dragon Crocodile Puppet Beast.</p><p></p><p>Now he was just missing a few core materials from second-grade mid-rank demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>That night.</p><p>In the secret room below his residence.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Condensing Array, Spirit Gathering Array, and Defensive Array were all activated, with layers of barriers concealing any disturbance from Su Yu's cultivation, not leaking a single trace outwards.</p><p></p><p>Bathed in the radiance of the Golden Cicada Technique, Su Yu's mind was utterly serene, his soul floating as if immersed in celestial light, feeling extremely comfortable.</p><p></p><p>The Cypress Wood Cycle Technique was rotating at a speed over one and a half times faster than usual.</p><p></p><p>Emerald green spiritual power permeated Su Yu's body, enhanced not only by the effect of a first-grade high-quality Qi Condensing Pill, but also by the array of low-grade spirit stones placed around him.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the emerald green radiance around Su Yu's body intensified greatly, and the aura of the Cypress Wood Cycle Technique subtly changed.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation naturally advanced from the seventh level of the Qi Condensation Realm to the eighth level.</p><p></p><p>At that instant, Su Yu's soul seemed to leave his physical body, manifesting the Golden Cicada Technique to take the form of a golden cicada, observing his corporeal body that was still steadily cultivating the Cypress Wood Cycle Technique.</p><p></p><p>"With the Golden Cicada Technique, the cultivation speed of the Cypress Wood Cycle Technique is indeed much faster," Su Yu rejoiced.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Life Span panel.</p><p></p><p>[Lifespan: 43/151]</p><p></p><p>"My lifespan has increased by another twelve years."</p><p></p><p>Crucially, the wood-attributed spiritual power of the Cypress Wood Cycle Technique's eighth complete cycle, which was originally unremarkable, had gradually strengthened with each cycle.</p><p></p><p>Now, the power of the Cypress Wood Cycle Technique's spiritual power was extremely formidable.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu felt that its aura was only slightly weaker than the spiritual power aura he had previously sensed from Luo Qianyu when she was at the ninth level of the Qi Condensation Realm.</p><p></p><p>But that was the ninth level of the Qi Condensation Realm—</p><p></p><p>He was currently only at the eighth level!</p><p></p><p>"The ninth cycle, the ninth level of the Qi Condensation Realm, perhaps I won't be weaker than Luo Qianyu back then," Su Yu's eyes focused intently.</p><p></p><p>Back then, Luo Qianyu was the strongest cultivator at the ninth level of the Qi Condensation Realm that he had ever encountered.</p>

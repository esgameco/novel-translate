        <h1>Chapter 69</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Suyu and Yuxi beside her listened with changing expressions, stunned for a long while. Suyu's face changed and he exclaimed in shock, "Chen Sisi, your senior martial sister Chen is gone? How could that be? Wasn't she responsible for guarding the outpost in Baiyue Immortal City?" </p><p></p><p>Yu Qianqing said with a gloomy and saddened expression, "Four months ago, an immortal path relic emerged from Baying Ridge. Senior Martial Sister wanted to go there to seek an opportunity. After breaking through to the Foundation Establishment realm, she felt restricted by bottlenecks. Continuing to cultivate peacefully would not yield any gains, so she had the idea to go out and temper herself."</p><p></p><p>"It just so happened that the Jinyu Immortal Sect relic appeared, so Senior Martial Sister applied to go there."</p><p></p><p>"Little did we expect it would turn out this way."</p><p></p><p>Suyu looked dazed. It had been some time since he last saw Chen Sisi. After first coming to Baiyue Immortal City and feasting with Chen Sisi and Yu Qianqing, he had not seen her again.</p><p></p><p>And now, hearing news of Chen Sisi again, she had already passed into the afterlife.</p><p></p><p>Not everyone is suited for secluded cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Suyu had a proficiency panel, so he only needed to cultivate diligently day by day to gradually accumulate proficiency and break through his cultivation realm.</p><p></p><p>But for others, it was difficult.</p><p></p><p>Both resources and state of mind would affect one's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>So it was normal for Chen Sisi to want to go to the Jinyu Immortal Sect relic and temper herself to seek an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>However, wherever one went to temper themselves, there would inevitably be danger.</p><p></p><p>Especially in a place of turmoil like Baying Ridge now.</p><p></p><p>"How was she injured?" Suyu asked the slightly plump Yu Qianqing.</p><p></p><p>Yu Qianqing said, "I heard it was an encounter with the demonic path, that Blood Saber Daoist Luo Bang who stole the incomplete supreme-grade magic treasure in Yunshan Market. His power is formidable. Senior Martial Sister Chen was severely injured by just one of his saber strikes."</p><p></p><p>"The reason Senior Martial Sister Chen did not survive was because of the corrosion from the Blood Saber Daoist's demonic qi. Otherwise, Senior Martial Sister would definitely have recovered."</p><p></p><p>Blood Saber Luo Bang.</p><p></p><p>Suyu silently murmured this name, saying nothing.</p><p></p><p>Yu Qianqing also mentioned Chen Sisi's burial site. According to Chen Sisi's wishes, she was finally laid to rest in the Su Family's Cangshanmu Cemetery and had likely been buried over half a month ago.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Yu Qianqing left.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation world is like this. There are almost accidents every day. No matter where you are, you may encounter danger and lose your life," Yuxi said in a low murmur to the silent Suyu. Then she said, "Shall we go back and take a look?"</p><p></p><p>Suyu thought for a moment and said, "Tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Yuxi said, "Then we'll call Sisi's martial niece to come along."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Yuxi also left the Pill Pavilion. She had to make arrangements for the Yuxi Family's outpost first.</p><p></p><p>They had known Chen Sisi for over twenty years. Now that their old friend had passed, they could not ignore it.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, they could go back and make offerings to see her off properly.</p><p></p><p>Suyu looked at the qiankun pouch Chen Sisi said to give him and felt puzzled. He then undid the seal and sent his spiritual sense inside.</p><p></p><p>There were quite a few things inside, probably all items Chen Sisi had used in life.</p><p></p><p>There were also a few hundred low-grade spirit stones, some pills, clothing, and so on.</p><p></p><p>"She said to give me this qiankun pouch, so there must be something inside she wanted to give me? What could it be?" Suyu's spiritual sense scanned over the spirit stones, pills, magic treasures, clothing, and other items.</p><p></p><p>Finally, at the bottom, he discovered a few ancient jade boxes that had been opened and resealed with restrictions.</p><p></p><p>After some hesitation, Suyu removed Chen Sisi's familiar restrictive spell from the few ancient jade boxes and opened them one by one.</p><p></p><p>There were six jade boxes in total, five of which were empty.</p><p></p><p>Only one contained an inkstone-like spherical bead that emanated faint traces of spiritual aura, causing Suyu's pupils to suddenly constrict. "This thingâ€”"</p><p></p><p>He seemed to recognize it!</p><p></p><p>And under the spherical bead, there was also a...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Sealing the letter.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu took out the letter and opened it to see a line of elegant small characters entering his eyes. </p><p></p><p>It described some of her experiences and unexpected opportunities she encountered at Bayaoxiling, and in there, she discovered that extraordinary bead.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, she still decided to hand over this object to Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the letter, she entrusted him to take care of the Chen family.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu read it several times, remaining silent for a long while: "......"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao is unpredictable. </p><p></p><p>The path of immortality is equally difficult to tread, no one dares to guarantee eternal youthfulness.</p><p></p><p>Putting away the letter, Su Yu's gaze fell on the ink jade-like round bead, his pupils contracting slightly as he sensed the spiritual power emanating from the round bead, he couldn't help but exclaim in shock: "Is this really a Kuanghun?"</p><p></p><p>Just as there are treasured artifacts existing on magical weapons, there are also treasured talismans existing on ordinary talismans.</p><p></p><p>In the realm of puppets, ancient cultivators similarly crafted a special type of treasure called Kuanghun, meaning the soul of a puppet, or a soul treasure.</p><p></p><p>This round bead should be the embryonic form of a Kuanghun.</p><p></p><p>According to the inheritance of the 'Forging Method of the Golden Jade Celestial Puppet', Kuanghun is the 'treasured artifact' or 'treasured talisman' of puppets.</p><p></p><p>It can be integrated into any puppet, forming a puppet akin to a 'treasured artifact'. It can be absorbed into the dantian to be nurtured, and can devour special materials to gradually elevate the rank of the puppet, cultivating the Kuanghun.</p><p></p><p>Just like the fabled flying swords cultivated by sword cultivators as their life-bound treasures.</p><p></p><p>Although this embryonic Kuanghun bead is still just an embryo, the spiritual aura emanating from it is extraordinary, causing even Su Yu to feel a chill upon sensing it.</p><p></p><p>It's possible that this embryonic Kuanghun has already reached the peak of the Foundation Establishment realm, or even the pseudo-Pill realm.</p><p></p><p>According to the inheritance, the Celestial Puppets of the Golden Jade Immortal Sect require a Kuanghun to be forged.</p><p></p><p>However, there is no information left regarding just how powerful these Celestial Puppets are.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's brows furrowed slightly, feeling both delighted and troubled: "Can the Dragon Crocodile Puppet Beast withstand the integration of this embryonic Kuanghun bead?"</p><p></p><p>Let's give it a try!</p><p></p><p>Su Yu gritted his teeth and summoned his Dao Body Puppet, and to his surprise, the fusion between the Dao Body Puppet and the embryonic Kuanghun bead went far more smoothly than expected.</p><p></p><p>He severed a strand of his soul and infused it into the Dao Body Puppet to take control of the Kuanghun, then fused the Kuanghun with the puppet.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Cicada Art, Dao Body Puppet Technique, Kuanghun, and puppets - these were simply a perfect match.</p><p></p><p>However, after integrating the Kuanghun, Su Yu realized that while it was fine when not utilizing the Kuanghun, once he did use it, the power of the Kuanghun would need to be re-nurtured and accumulated.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, at the current rank of the Kuanghun, if its full power was unleashed, the Dragon Crocodile Puppet Beast might be severely injured in a single battle, unable to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>These two issues were not major problems.</p><p></p><p>The first issue could be resolved by the Golden Cicada Art, which would greatly accelerate the recovery speed of the Kuanghun.</p><p></p><p>As for the second issue -</p><p></p><p>If the Dragon Crocodile Puppet Beast could absorb materials to elevate itself to a second-rank superior puppet, then there would be no issues at all.</p><p></p><p>And if it couldn't be elevated in a short period of time, with the Kuanghun present, as long as it devoured materials, the Dragon Crocodile Puppet Beast would still be able to recover to its original state and would not be directly destroyed. So, it wasn't a big problem.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring these issues.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the embryonic Kuanghun bead had already given Su Yu an unprecedented means of self-preservation.</p><p></p><p>Chen Sisi had delivered to him an opportunity and great gift that he could not refuse.</p><p></p><p>As he pondered, Su Yu gazed silently towards the direction of the Yunjian Sect's domain. He had never thought of getting involved in the remnants of the Golden Jade Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>But who could have imagined that he, a person far away in Baiyue Immortal City, would still obtain a great opportunity from the remnants of the Golden Jade Immortal Sect?</p><p></p><p>However, the karmic tie that Chen Sisi had formed, he still had to repay.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

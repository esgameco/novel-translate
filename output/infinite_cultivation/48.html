        <h1>Chapter 48</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This news made many forces envious, after all it was a spirit-nourishing fruit tree, not just a spirit-nourishing fruit. </p><p></p><p>With this fruit tree, they would basically never lack the core material for refining Foundation Establishment Pills in the future.</p><p></p><p>Some forces even wanted to intervene, but before they could, the great battle between the Yu Family and the Huang Family had already ended. </p><p></p><p>The Yu Family seized that spirit-nourishing fruit tree from the Huang Family.</p><p></p><p>This made the Yu Family the center of attention for a time, causing countless cultivators and cultivating families to become envious.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning that the Yu Family obtained a spirit-nourishing fruit tree, Su Yu had no particular thoughts, only feeling that the Yu Family's high profile may not necessarily be a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Especially with demon cultivators and calamity cultivators frequently appearing nearby.</p><p></p><p>However, this matter had nothing to do with Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>The material collection for the second-grade lower-rank Dragon Alligator Puppet Beast was a bit slow, so he planned to return to his family clan soon and head to Bai Yue Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Of course, before leaving, Su Yu had to stock up on some second-grade lower-rank Thunder Fire Talismans.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he wouldn't feel safe.</p><p></p><p>Over the next half year, Su Yu spent around a thousand low-grade spirit stones to purchase twenty batches of talisman paper suitable for drawing Thunder Fire Talismans and demonic beast essence materials.</p><p></p><p>From these twenty batches of materials, he successfully made eight Thunder Fire Talismans.</p><p></p><p>At the Pill Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu said to the slightly gray-haired Su Gutong, "Next, Uncle Gutong will temporarily manage the Pill Pavilion while I return to the clan."  </p><p></p><p>"As for who will manage the Pill Pavilion in the future, that will be up to the clan's decision."</p><p></p><p>Su Ruian couldn't help but say, "Elder, are you really leaving Cloud Mountain Town?"</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Su Yu slightly nodded and said, "Cloud Mountain Town is too small, and there's the Cloud Sword Sect above oppressing it. Apart from Cloud Sword Sect disciples, it's very difficult for anyone else to gain convenience here."</p><p></p><p>"Only Bai Yue Immortal City has more of what we need."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Su Yu discuss Bai Yue Immortal City, a look of longing appeared in the eyes of Su Gutong, Su Ruian, and the other members of the Su Family.</p><p></p><p>Without chatting idly with Su Gutong and the others for long, after making arrangements, Su Yu chose to leave.</p><p></p><p>He came as a youth, and though Su Yu was now forty years old when he left, he still felt like a youth.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of a youth, the mindset of a youth.</p><p></p><p>After staying in Cloud Mountain Town for twenty years, Su Yu stopped his spirit horse and looked back at the town one last time.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu laughed out loud a few times, filled with relaxation and delight, and swiftly rode away on his spirit horse.</p><p></p><p>In the town.</p><p></p><p>At the Heavenly Book Pavilion, an old man sitting behind the counter who had been dozing off suddenly woke up with a start. His divine sense probed out and saw Su Yu's figure leaving the town.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? This kid is leaving?"  The old man muttered, his expression a bit conflicted.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I'll give him a kind blessing."</p><p></p><p>In the end, the old man let out a slight sigh.</p><p></p><p>Over these years, he had found Su Yu a bit likable.</p><p></p><p>As he stretched out his hand, a jade slip appeared, but in the next moment, the old man waved his hand and the jade slip instantly vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu, who had already left Cloud Mountain Town over ten li away, was riding his spirit horse toward the Su Family.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a black dot descended from the sky and struck him on the head without any warning, almost knocking Su Yu off and causing him to fall.</p><p></p><p>"???"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu picked up the jade slip that had fallen to the ground and his pupils constricted as his divine sense scanned in all directions, but he didn't detect the presence of anyone.</p><p></p><p>He had no idea where this jade slip had come from.</p><p></p><p>Damn it.</p><p></p><p>Run quickly!</p><p></p><p>Su Yu was jolted, and immediately spurred his horse to gallop madly. He ran for hundreds of li before finally stopping in a desolate forest.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"What the hell is this thing?" Su Yu took out the jade slip, his brows furrowed. </p><p></p><p>Being hit by this object on the forehead actually caused a bump, despite his Crocodile Demon's 108 Body Refinement Techniques reaching the ninth level.</p><p></p><p>This was very ominous!</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a long time, Su Yu carefully probed the jade slip with his spiritual sense. The next moment, a complete second-grade superior talisman master inheritance poured into his mind.</p><p></p><p>It took more than an hour before Su Yu recovered from that tremendous amount of information, staring in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>This!</p><p></p><p>A second-grade superior talisman master inheritance descended from the heavens?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this inheritance was not simple, originating from an ancient cultivation sect called the Golden Jade Immortal Gate during the primordial era. </p><p></p><p>It even recorded the complete inheritance of the three fragmentary ancient talismans he had previously obtained from the Heavenly Book Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Book Pavilionâ€”</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Su Yu's heart stirred as he thought of the old man there.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this is..."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu turned to look towards Cloud Mountain Town, his expression somewhat complex. Previously, when he asked the shopkeeper of the Heavenly Book Pavilion for the talisman master inheritance, he was firmly refused. Now that he was leaving Cloud Mountain Town, a second-grade superior ancient talisman master inheritance had struck his forehead.</p><p></p><p>He did not believe this was truly a heavenly opportunity.</p><p></p><p>He bowed towards the direction of Cloud Mountain Town: "For today's opportunity, your junior will engrave it in his heart."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Su Yu mounted his horse again and continued his return to Jiang City's Cang Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>At the blessed land of Cang Mountain in Jiang City.</p><p></p><p>After many years, Su Yu returned and saw a scene of prosperity in Cang Mountain. Slightly closer to the blessed land, the Su family had opened up plot after plot of spiritual fields to grow spiritual rice.</p><p></p><p>As for the original fields, they continued to expand outwards, nourished by the spiritual qi of a first-grade spiritual vein, allowing the planting of spiritual herbs even in the areas further out.</p><p></p><p>The Su family's manor in the blessed land had expanded greatly, with figures of people visible throughout the fields.</p><p></p><p>Over twenty years ago, there were only around a hundred cultivators in the Su family.</p><p></p><p>But now, the number of Su family cultivators was nearly a hundred and fifty.</p><p></p><p>Apart from nearly twenty new cultivators from their own family, there were over thirty outside cultivators who had pledged allegiance to the Su family.</p><p></p><p>However, when Su Yu entered the manor, he could sense an oppressive atmosphere in the household.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, in the Su family's main hall.</p><p></p><p>The family master Su Peng, Elder Su Yun, Second Elder Su Chang, Third Elder Su Ruosu, and Fourth Elder Su Jingbang had all arrived.</p><p></p><p>"You're back?" Su Peng had begun to show signs of aging.</p><p></p><p>He was over seventy years old. Although he had cultivated the family master's Willow Green Wood Mantra, extending his lifespan beyond that of an ordinary ninth level Qi Condensation cultivator, at this age, he had reached his final peak period.</p><p></p><p>After a few more years, Su Peng's hopes of breaking through to the Foundation Establishment realm would become extremely slim.</p><p></p><p>"Family Master, Master, Second Elder, Third Elder, Fourth Elder." Su Yu greeted each of them respectfully. </p><p></p><p>Then, his brows furrowed as he asked, "What's happening in the family again?"</p><p></p><p>"Alas."</p><p></p><p>Su Peng sighed, saying, "The Jiang family has sent someone with a letter. Their eldest son of the main branch wants to take Xiaozhi as a concubine, asking us to persuade Xiaozhi to accept."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's expression changed slightly. The Jiang family?</p><p></p><p>For a moment, he was puzzled. Why would the Jiang family approach the Su family? And why would they set their sights on Su Zhi, who was still in the Cloud Sword Sect?</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's brows knitted tightly as he said, "So you're saying the Jiang family is pressuring us? Trying to force Zhi-jie to accept this marriage?"</p><p></p><p>The newly promoted Elder Su Yun said in a low voice, "The eldest son of the Jiang family's main branch has a very close relationship with the sect master of the Cloud Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>"As for Xiaozhi, she is considered part of the elder lineage of the Cloud Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>Sect infighting!</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's pupils constricted as he inwardly raged. This was truly a case of celestials fighting while mortals suffer. The Jiang family must see the Su family as easy to bully.</p><p></p><p>But after serious consideration, compared to the Jiang family's strength and influence, the Su family did seem rather easy to bully.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

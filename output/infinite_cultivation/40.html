        <h1>Chapter 40</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Yu Ke'er blinked at Su Yu and said, "The rock rats have a unique spiritual sense towards spirit veins or spirit mines, which can be used to search for spirit mines."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Yu realized. The rock rat demonic beasts have very poor spiritual intelligence bloodlines, and are actually not suitable to be used as mounts. </p><p></p><p>However, if using rock rat demonic beasts to search for spirit mines, this is indeed a good idea.</p><p></p><p>It's just that early-stage second-rank rock rats...</p><p></p><p>Su Yu hesitated and said, "I haven't tried whether I can tame early second-rank demonic beasts, so I can only say, try out a few first."</p><p></p><p>Yu Ke'er readily agreed, "Okay, let's start with ten then."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, Yu Ke'er tossed a beast taming bag to Su Yu and said, "Inside is a black-scaled eagle demonic beast egg that our family found in the Eight Demon Ridge. This is a mid-to-high second-rank bloodline flying demonic beast, originally very suitable to be used as a mount."</p><p></p><p>"However, this demonic beast egg was somehow tainted with a trace of demonic aura, causing it to become a bit ferocious, not very suitable as a mount."</p><p></p><p>"You can choose to hatch it yourself, consume it, or sell it. It's up to you how to deal with it."</p><p></p><p>"This is the deposit first. There will be another reward after we lure the second-rank Rat King."</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Yu Ke'er and the others left. Su Yu stayed with Chen Sissi.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu asked, "What's the deal between the Chen family and the Yu family?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Sissi smiled charmingly. Compared to before, the married Chen Sissi was full of charm and allure. Every slight movement and smile exuded a faint seductive aura, and her bewitching eyes looked even more beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Chen Sissi said in a low voice, "The Chen family, on the condition of luring the Rock Rat King for the Yu family, has secured a second-rank early stage demonic beast mount that was retired by the Yu family."</p><p></p><p>"It's equivalent to exchanging an early second-rank Rock Rat King for a retired early second-rank mount from the Yu family."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the premise is that we can successfully lure and tame the Rat King, and the cost will be fully borne by the Chen family."</p><p></p><p>I see.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu had thought that the Yu family would personally intervene to support the Chen family in suppressing the Huang family.</p><p></p><p>It turned out not to be the case; it was just for that early second-rank rock rat demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>However, it didn't really concern him. Regardless of whether the two families could lure the Rat King or not, he had already earned money from both of them.</p><p></p><p>"How is Qing Yi doing? Has his arm been reattached?" After dealing with miscellaneous matters, Su Yu turned to Chen Sissi and asked about Su Qingyi's condition.</p><p></p><p>Chen Sissi looked bitter, "No, that arm is gone for good, there's no way it could be reattached."</p><p></p><p>"After this injury, his future cultivation will likely become problematic..."</p><p></p><p>Biting her silver teeth, Chen Sissi said, "In the sect, there is a second-rank top-grade Flesh Regeneration Pill that can revive the dead and regenerate bones. It can resolve the issue of missing limbs. I'll see if I can accumulate enough contribution points to exchange for one in the future."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu comforted Chen Sissi for a while before she took her leave.</p><p></p><p>Watching Chen Sissi's back as she left, Su Yu sighed inwardly. He had said that going to the Chen family's Purple Gold Sand Spirit Mine for guard duty would be very dangerous, so he directly refused the patriarch's suggestion and chose to return to the town to cultivate in peace.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the one who might have lost an arm or even life could have been him.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't refused, Su Qingyi wouldn't have been sent to that Chen family spirit mine either.</p><p></p><p>"In the future... we'll see. A second-rank top-grade Flesh Regeneration Pill, I probably need to reach the middle stage of the Foundation Establishment realm to refine it. It's too early to think about it now." Su Yu shook his head and sighed. By that time, Su Qingyi would probably be old.</p><p></p><p>The Flesh Regeneration Pill wouldn't be of much use either.</p><p></p><p>He took out a demonic beast egg the size of a head from the beast taming bag given by Yu Ke'er.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This demonic beast egg was entirely dark black like ink jade. However, it was now emanating wispy blood-red demonic aura. The unhatched youngling inside seemed exceptionally restless and irritable. </p><p></p><p>It was just a demonic beast egg, but when Su Yu took it out to examine it, he could sense the slight hostility towards him from the little creature inside!</p><p></p><p>It seemed to want to devour him!</p><p></p><p>Su Yu frowned slightly as he looked at the demonic beast egg: "Ba Yao Ling...how could a demonic beast egg be tainted with demonic aura? What happened there?"</p><p></p><p>First, there was a large influx of demonic cultivators and renegade cultivators entering the territory of Yunjianzong. Then there was the token of an inner disciple from the major demonic sect Nine Souls Demon Palace found on the Demon-Headed Golden Eagle. After that, the Demonic Blood Blade cultivator also went to Ba Yao Ling.</p><p></p><p>Now the Yu Family has also discovered a demonic beast egg tainted with demonic aura from Ba Yao Ling.</p><p></p><p>This series of events made Su Yu feel a vague sense of unease.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic aura...I wonder if it can be dispelled?" Su Yu tried infusing it with his own cultivation power, gradually eroding the demonic aura on the surface. But in the next moment, he realized something was amiss - the demonic aura was not just a taint, but had caused a mutation in this demonic beast egg.</p><p></p><p>Now this demonic beast egg had become a demonic demonic beast, and that demonic aura was its own.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu inwardly cursed Yu Ke'er for setting a trap, no wonder the Yu Family didn't want this demonic beast egg.</p><p></p><p>"Eat...I probably can't eat it, the demonic qi from this demonic beast egg is more poisonous to cultivators than actual poison. I can't throw it away either, since it's something I paid for with great effort. So I can't destroy it either."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu was vexed and could only continue trying to infuse it with his cultivation power to see if he could cultivate some affection with it.</p><p></p><p>"Huh, it seems to be working?"</p><p></p><p>Not long after.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu detected a slight change in the demonic beast egg. Its aura no longer seemed so restless, and its hostility had also diminished greatly. This black-scaled hawk demonic beast egg was happily absorbing the power of his ancient Cangmu Suixun cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>"The mutated demonic bloodline probably can't be changed, but if it can regain its intelligence to control its bloodline, then it should still be able to become a beast companion?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu felt excited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the young Fire Ape before, it had gained a significant boost to its intelligence precisely because of the nourishment of his cultivation power, with no signs of losing control even until now.</p><p></p><p>If the Fire Ape could change, then this Black-Scaled Hawk shouldn't be a problem either, right?</p><p></p><p>After feeding the Black-Scaled Hawk demonic beast egg with his power, Su Yu put it away and began trying to refine even stronger beast-luring powders to see if more potent spirit medicines would work on second-stage early demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Su Yu gave Yu Ke'er the first ten samples of his super beast-luring powder.</p><p></p><p>Under the constant nourishment and gestation of the power from his ancient Cangmu Suixun cultivation method, a month later, the Black-Scaled Hawk demonic beast egg's aura underwent a transformation. It no longer harbored any hostility towards him, and it could control the release of its demonic aura at will.</p><p></p><p>The mutated Black-Scaled Hawk demonic beast egg's aura was now twice as strong as an ordinary Black-Scaled Hawk demonic beast egg's.</p><p></p><p>When Yu Ke'er returned to the market town after successfully luring the second-stage early Earthrock Rat King from the Chen Family, and saw the Black-Scaled Hawk demonic beast egg again, she was utterly astonished.</p><p></p><p>"Ah ah ah, its, its bloodline aura, how did it change completely!?" Yu Ke'er exclaimed repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>The transformed Black-Scaled Hawk demonic beast egg made Yu Ke'er extremely covetous. She proposed various conditions to try to trade for it from Su Yu, even resorting to feminine wiles. But alas, in the end her own face flushed red with embarrassment, while Su Yu's heart remained completely unmoved - his eyes could appreciate beauty.</p><p></p><p>But his heart did not waver!</p><p></p><p>This infuriated Yu Ke'er. That damn Su Yu, how could he be so ungallant?</p><p></p><p>Half a month later, under Yu Ke'er's envious and covetous gaze, the Black-Scaled Hawk demonic beast egg hatched, and Su Yu used his beast taming arts to make it his beast companion.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

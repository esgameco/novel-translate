        <h1>Chapter 63</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi was born into the Cloud Sword Sect and knew how rare it was to obtain a high-quality foundation pill. Even the second-grade senior pill refiners of the Cloud Sword Sect had only managed to refine two or three such pills over the years. </p><p></p><p>It was possible that after refining five or six batches of foundation pills, one high-quality pill might be produced by chance.</p><p></p><p>And within the Cloud Sword Sect, only the direct disciples had the opportunity to request high-quality foundation pills; others did not even have a chance to exchange for them.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Su Zhi did not expect Su Yu to be able to refine many foundation pills, as long as there was one of ordinary quality.</p><p></p><p>But now, looking at the two high-quality and two ordinary foundation pills before her, she deeply realized just how strong her younger brother's pill refining skills were.</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi was dazed for a long time before finally taking a few deep breaths to suppress her joy and excitement. Looking at Su Yu, she said, "If your pill refining skills were to spread, there would definitely be many people coming to ask you to refine pills for them."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Yu hurriedly said, "No, this is just a fluke for me."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, I'm still only at the Qi Refining realm. If this gets out, it will bring trouble rather than blessings."</p><p></p><p>When Su Zhi heard this, her expression changed slightly as she remembered that Su Yu was still only at the eighth level of the Qi Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>With such cultivation, yet able to refine high-quality foundation pills—</p><p></p><p>"Whew."</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi took another deep breath and looked at Su Yu with a complicated expression, saying, "Your pill refining talent really is as monstrous as Sister Chen and Sister Yu said."</p><p></p><p>"If only your spiritual root was a bit better, or if I could give you mine, that would be great."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu smiled and said, "Sister, I don't want your spiritual root."</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual roots are destined by heaven, but one's achievements are not predetermined. Just like the legendary Real Person Under the Moon, didn't he also achieve the realm of Pill Immortal despite having an inferior spiritual root?"</p><p></p><p>"My current pace of cultivation is actually quite good, steady and progressive."</p><p></p><p>After their casual chat, Su Yu and Su Zhi discussed how to handle these foundation pills.</p><p></p><p>"The First Elder, Second Elder, and Third Elder are all quite old. Although they are at the ninth level of the Qi Refining realm, the possibility of them breaking through to the Foundation Establishment realm is almost non-existent. Even with foundation pills, they probably wouldn't choose to take them."</p><p></p><p>"So, in our family, there are currently two candidates left: my father, who is seventy-three years old, and Su Jing Bang, the Fourth Elder, who is seventy-five years old."</p><p></p><p>"They are both on the verge of being able to attempt to break through to the Foundation Establishment realm, but the probability of failure is quite high for both of them."</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi explained the situation of the Su family.</p><p></p><p>"For those younger, in their fifties and sixties at the eighth level of the Qi Refining realm, our family currently has four."</p><p></p><p>"We don't need to consider them for now; we'll see about them later."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu listened and said, "Since that's the case, let's invite the family leader and Elder Jing Bang to come to Bai Yue Immortal City."</p><p></p><p>"There are two high-quality foundation pills, just enough for the two of them."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Zhi immediately objected, "No, you must keep one high-quality foundation pill for yourself."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu opened his mouth but didn't know how to explain.</p><p></p><p>He didn't actually have any bottlenecks; as long as his proficiency reached the required level, he could break through.</p><p></p><p>Even the Foundation Establishment realm was the same for him.</p><p></p><p>But this was obviously something he couldn't reveal or explain.</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi looked at Su Yu and said, "You have to listen to me on this. You must keep one high-quality foundation pill for yourself."</p><p></p><p>"I'll write a letter to have Father and the Fourth Elder come to Bai Yue Immortal City."</p><p></p><p>In the following days, there were clearly more joyful laughter and voices in the courtyard house, and Su Zhi's face also had more smiles.</p><p></p><p>In addition to his daily cultivation, Su Yu was refining a second-grade low-rank Dragon Alligator Puppet Beast.</p><p></p><p>He had prepared top-notch materials for the Dragon Alligator Puppet Beast.</p><p></p><p>The core was a second-grade mid-period demonic beast crystal nucleus.</p><p></p><p>The scales and claws were from second-grade...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Mid-tier demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>Once successfully refined, this dragon alligator puppet beast would absolutely be among the top tier of second-grade lower-rank puppet beasts.  </p><p></p><p>Ordinary Condensing Foundation cultivators at the third level would likely have trouble dealing with the dragon alligator puppet beast.</p><p></p><p>In addition,</p><p></p><p>Su Yu had started practicing the Earth-attribute Condensing Foundation technique 'Profound Nether Thick Earth Scripture' that he acquired at the auction.</p><p></p><p>It was said that this Earth-attribute technique also originated from the ancient Jade Box, and was quite profound.  </p><p></p><p>However, since it was only a Condensing Foundation fourth level technique, its value was not considered high.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating for ten days, Su Yu's 'Profound Nether Thick Earth Scripture' reached the Qi Refining first level of attainment.</p><p></p><p>A month later, his 'Profound Nether Thick Earth Scripture' reached the Qi Refining second level.</p><p></p><p>This speed of advancement was unimaginably fast.</p><p></p><p>With the aid of his own eighth level of the Qi Refining 'Cypress Wood Yearly Cycle Technique' and the Golden Cicada Method, the progress of his 'Profound Nether Thick Earth Scripture' exceeded expectations.  </p><p></p><p>Another month passed, and the 'Profound Nether Thick Earth Scripture' had reached the Qi Refining third level.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Su Yu had mastered the two Earth-attribute spells he was practicing to the perfect realm.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, after receiving Su Zhi's letter, the Su Family was greatly shaken. Although the letter did not mention Condensing Pellets, Su Zhi asking Su Peng and Su Jingbang to go to Worship Moon Immortal City to attempt breakthroughs was almost an outright statement.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Didn't Zhi go to acquire core materials like the Void Spirit Fruit? How did she end up asking me and the Fourth Elder to go to Worship Moon Immortal City to attempt breakthroughs?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that she and Yu obtained Condensing Pellets? But that doesn't seem right, she's asking both of us to go, this—"  </p><p></p><p>They were both astonished and puzzled.</p><p></p><p>After discussing with the other family members, especially the decision of the Condensing Foundation cultivator Su Bin, Su Peng and Su Jingbang set off for Worship Moon Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>As for the First Elder Su Yun, Second Elder Su Chang, and Third Elder Su Ruosu, they did not dwell on it much.  </p><p></p><p>They were already old and had long given up on the idea of breaking through to the Condensing Foundation realm.</p><p></p><p>Instead,</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Peng and Su Jingbang set off for Worship Moon Immortal City, the three elders were filled with immense anticipation and hope.</p><p></p><p>If even one of them succeeded in breaking through to the Condensing Foundation realm, the Su Family's strength would increase again.</p><p></p><p>This would be a tremendously good thing.</p><p></p><p>Thus,</p><p></p><p>Two months after the Condensing Pellets were refined, Su Peng and Su Jingbang arrived at Worship Moon Immortal City, coming to Su Yu's courtyard residence.  </p><p></p><p>"Let's go, we'll rent a cave abode in the core area. The spiritual qi from the third-grade spiritual vein there will be more conducive to your breakthroughs." After Su Zhi briefly explained about the Condensing Pellets to Su Peng and Su Jingbang, before the two could recover, Su Yu led the three of them out.</p><p></p><p>Renting a cave abode in the core area for half a year required six hundred low-grade spirit stones.  </p><p></p><p>After Su Yu rented the breakthrough cave abode for Su Peng and Su Jingbang, he left Su Zhi behind to protect them while he returned to his own courtyard residence to continue refining the dragon alligator puppet beast.</p><p></p><p>As for the Condensing Pellets, he currently had one superior quality pellet and one ordinary quality pellet left in his possession.</p><p></p><p>Refining puppet beasts was not easy, but Su Yu had started refining this one years ago.  </p><p></p><p>Now he just needed to refine the missing core components to complete it.</p><p></p><p>So, while Su Peng, Su Jingbang and the others were attempting to break through to the Condensing Foundation realm in that cave abode in the core area, half a month after returning to his courtyard residence, Su Yu succeeded!</p><p></p><p>The second-grade lower-rank dragon alligator puppet beast was refined!</p><p></p><p>Inside the secret room, a monster resembling a ferocious dragon three zhang tall yet with the head, limbs, and tail of a monstrous alligator appeared in this world.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of this dragon alligator puppet beast was slightly different from the puppet master inheritance Su Yu had obtained.  </p><p></p><p>And this slightly modified puppet beast undoubtedly emanated an even stronger aura.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

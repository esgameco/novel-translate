        <h1>Chapter 52</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Not long after leaving, a young man at the second level of Qi refining came over and respectfully said, "Senior, have you just arrived at Bai Yue Xian City? Do you need directions? It's one low-grade spirit stone per day."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu looked at him. This thin and swarthy young man looked like a little monkey, respectful yet a bit cunning.  </p><p></p><p>Su Yu nodded and said, "Then lead the way."</p><p></p><p>The young man was overjoyed and carefully followed behind Su Yu, cautiously asking, "Senior, where would you like to go?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu said, "Just wander around. Tell me about Bai Yue Xian City."</p><p></p><p>The young man understood and said as they walked, "Bai Yue Xian City was created by the True Lord Bai Yue, who has three direct disciples in charge of the Spirit Hall, Battle Hall, and Truth Hall respectively."</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Hall controls all spirit fields and spirit objects in the city, including housing and cave abode transactions in the inner and outer domains outside the core area."</p><p>"This is overseen by the True Lord's eldest disciple, Elder Tian Pu."</p><p></p><p>"The Battle Hall commands all the city guards, including the battle squads." </p><p>"This is overseen by the True Lord's second disciple, Fairy Wind Spirit."</p><p></p><p>"The Truth Hall recruits cultivators skilled in various arts, recently established by the True Lord's third disciple Xu Wansheng."</p><p></p><p>The young man continued, "The outer domain has a spirit qi density equivalent to a first-grade spirit vein blessed land, inhabited mostly by Qi refiners and those without spiritual roots, quite chaotic."</p><p></p><p>"The houses or cave abodes in the inner domain have a density equal to a second-grade spirit vein blessed land, inhabited mostly by late-stage Qi refiners and Foundation Establishment elders. The core area has cave abodes with third-grade spirit vein blessed land spirit qi density."</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Su Yu and cautiously asked, "Senior, would you like to stay in the outer or inner domain?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu pondered for a moment and said, "Let's go to the inner domain."</p><p>"Do you know of any good houses for sale in the inner domain?"</p><p></p><p>"I do, I do."</p><p></p><p>After asking Su Yu's requirements, the young man led him to the inner domain of Bai Yue Xian City, passing through another great formation separating the inner and outer areas.</p><p></p><p>Instantly upon entering the inner city gate, a more concentrated celestial and earthly spiritual qi enveloped them.</p><p></p><p>The young man took Su Yu to five places before finally choosing an empty courtyard at the end of an alley.</p><p></p><p>The courtyard was not large, with a front yard and three rooms.</p><p>Below each of the three rooms was a sealed chamber for secluded cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu spent 1,300 low-grade spirit stones to purchase it, with the Spirit Hall collecting nearly 100 low-grade spirit stones as a transaction fee.</p><p></p><p>There were six courtyards in this alley. Besides Su Yu's, the other five were occupied.</p><p></p><p>The young man was quite familiar with the area and knew who lived in those five courtyards.</p><p></p><p>"Across from Senior's courtyard live two fairies, rumored to be from the Drunken Immortal Pavilion. Senior will definitely have eye candy living here."</p><p></p><p>"The courtyard next to Senior's has a first-grade high-rank Refiner living there."</p><p></p><p>"The outermost courtyard seems to be home to a family of four who mainly work the city's spirit fields."</p><p></p><p>"Then there are two other families - one has a first-grade high-rank Talisman Master who joined the Truth Hall as a cultivator."  </p><p></p><p>"The other has a ninth-level Qi Refining elder who keeps to himself. Not sure what he does."</p><p></p><p>After completing the courtyard transaction, Su Yu followed the young man to explore the neighborhood and purchase household items.</p><p></p><p>Just a few streets away was a market street, bustling with not only shops but also wandering cultivator stalls selling various goods.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu even saw shops selling second-grade demonic beast essence blood, second-grade talismans, and other materials.</p><p></p><p>On the way back, the young man took Su Yu on a detour to see the Drunken Immortal Pavilion he had mentioned.</p><p></p><p>Fairies incarnated as singing and dancing beauties, making one mutter "shameless" yet still drawn to approach from afar.</p><p></p><p>But Su Yu only glanced at it from a distance, hearing faint zither and flute melodies drifting out, a contemplative look on his face.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the hundred arts includes the art of music. </p><p></p><p>It's just not known whether the musical arts here are proper or not.</p><p></p><p>Ahem.</p><p></p><p>Let's go back.</p><p></p><p>Giving the young man a low-grade spirit stone as hardship pay, Su Yu returned to the courtyard alone and tidied up the room where he lived.</p><p></p><p>He then set up a top-grade first-level defensive array in the courtyard, as well as a spirit-gathering array in the secret room of his quarters.</p><p></p><p>"Mission accomplished."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu nodded in satisfaction, having temporarily found a nest in the Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Although still quite simple, he could gradually acquire whatever was lacking later on.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Su Yu sat cross-legged in the secret room and began his cultivation for the day.</p><p></p><p>Acquiring the small courtyard cost Su Yu 1,300 low-grade spirit stones, and he now had a small treasury of nearly 3,000 low-grade spirit stones left.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like a lot, but in reality he might spend 800 to 1,000 low-grade spirit stones on his cultivation every year.</p><p></p><p>Besides that, there were also the costs of improving his pill refining, talisman crafting, and puppet crafting ranks and proficiencies.</p><p></p><p>Especially for puppet crafting, he still lacked half the materials for the second-rank Dragon Alligator Puppet Beast.</p><p></p><p>That alone would require at least another 2,000 low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"After settling down, I'll have to figure out how to make money," Su Yu pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>Pill refining, talisman crafting, and puppet crafting could all be used to earn money.</p><p></p><p>Butâ€”</p><p></p><p>He didn't plan to reveal all of his abilities.</p><p></p><p>"So on the surface, I'll use the identity of a pill refiner."</p><p></p><p>"If pill refining can't sustain my income and expenses, then I can secretly sell some talismans in the dark."</p><p></p><p>After completing his daily cultivation routine, Su Yu thought of Chen Sisi, who had previously come to take up residence at the Moon Immortal City's branch.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Su Yu thought to himself, "I'll invite her to get together after settling down."</p><p></p><p>After all, she was an old acquaintance.</p><p></p><p>In the deep night, two women wearing veils walked arm-in-arm back to the alley and exclaimed in surprise, "Someone has moved in across the way?"</p><p></p><p>The next morning, while Su Yu was still cultivating the Golden Cicada Technique, there was a knock at the door.</p><p></p><p>When Su Yu went to open it, he saw a woman in a light blue dress and white veil standing outside.</p><p></p><p>Although her appearance was obscured, she seemed to have at least an eight out of ten beauty.</p><p></p><p>The woman also exuded a unique transcendent aura, like an immortal maiden in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Seeing her, Su Yu was momentarily stunned by her beauty.</p><p></p><p>But he quickly recovered and said with some surprise, "You are..."</p><p></p><p>The woman laughed lightly and handed him a basket of fruit, saying, "I'm your neighbor from across the way, named Luan Xi. Last night I saw that you had moved in, so I took the liberty of visiting you today. Here are some common spirit fruits; I hope you don't disdain them."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu accepted the basket and said, "Su Yu. Of course I don't disdain them, thank you."</p><p></p><p>He then added apologetically, "I should have been the one to visit first. My apologies."</p><p></p><p>After some casual conversation, the woman asked, "I don't yet know what arts Su Daoist excels in?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu replied, "Pill refining. I'm a first-rank high-grade pill refiner. If Daoist Luan needs any spirit pills, you can come to me."</p><p></p><p>Luan Xi's eyes lit up. "A pill refiner? Haha, good. Daoist Su will have to give me a discount then. With you here, our alley now has pill refiners, artifact refiners, and talisman crafters, hehehe."</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the woman took her leave.</p><p></p><p>Through their conversation, Su Yu gained a deeper understanding of the other neighbors. The woman's younger sister was named Luan Gong.</p><p></p><p>Both were professional musicians at the Drunken Immortal Pavilion, skilled in zither and string instruments.</p><p></p><p>Luan Xi was at the eighth layer of Qi Condensation, while Luan Gong was at the seventh.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu pondered going over to pay them a visit later, and could gift them some Qi Condensation Pills as presents.</p><p></p><p>An exchange of courtesies. He would have the opportunity to visit the other neighbors another time.</p><p></p><p>As for how to develop his pill refining business to earn money, he would need to carefully consider that.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

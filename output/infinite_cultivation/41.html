        <h1>Chapter 41</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Among beast taming, flying beast taming is much more popular than other types, especially those raised from a young age, able to achieve a mind-linked state with their master.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Yu Zhuan'er coveted this black-scaled demonic eagle beast was firstly because this black-scaled demonic eagle beast had mutated, with stronger power and bloodline. </p><p></p><p>Secondly, she cultivated archery arts, so if she could have a powerful flying beast mount, it would greatly enhance her strength.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the meat that Su Yu had gotten into his mouth, how could he possibly spit it out for her?</p><p></p><p>With the black-scaled eagle and the earth fire ape as two beast mounts, one extremely powerful on the ground and one extremely powerful in the air, joining forces they could greatly increase Su Yu's security.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the premise was raising them properly.</p><p></p><p>Not only did Su Yu not give the black-scaled demonic eagle beast egg to Yu Zhuan'er, he even asked her for the reward for previously refining the beast-luring powder - a core material for refining foundation pills.</p><p></p><p>Adding this, the Su family now had three core materials for refining foundation pills.</p><p></p><p>Yu Zhuan'er stayed in Cloud Mountain Town for another half year before disappearing without a trace.</p><p></p><p>As for Su Yu, he remained in the Pill Pavilion. Normally, apart from his daily cultivation routine, he was now researching three side professions - pill refining, talisman drawing and puppetry.</p><p></p><p>In the aspect of puppetry, having obtained the inheritance from the ancient jade box, Su Yu made rapid progress.</p><p></p><p>And while staying in the town, it was not difficult for him to collect materials for puppet beasts.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by in a blink.</p><p></p><p>Two years later.</p><p></p><p>Backyard of the Pill Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu made hand seals to cast a spell, instantly causing vines to erupt from the ground, trapping a huge one-zhang puppet beast in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Just as Su Yu was about to seize the opportunity to attack the puppet beast, it struggled with force.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!!!"</p><p></p><p>All the vines instantly shattered.</p><p></p><p>The jet-black, panther-like puppet beast flickered like a ghost, instantly appearing right in front of Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>A claw pressed against Su Yu's throat.</p><p></p><p>Having tried and failed again, Su Yu sighed in resignation.</p><p></p><p>Without using body refining techniques, relying solely on his sixth level of Qi Condensation realm cultivation, to try and deal with a peak top-grade first level puppet beast was just a pipe dream.</p><p></p><p>That strength comparable to the ninth level of Qi Condensation was completely beyond what the sixth level could match.</p><p></p><p>"Squeak squeak squeak!"</p><p></p><p>Not far away, on a large tree, a completely red-furred earth fire ape that had already reached six or seven feet tall and the mid first level demonic beast realm, was yelling at the puppet beast. It held a low-grade magical staff, itching to team up with its master to take down this black thing with a swing.</p><p></p><p>And on the roof behind, a black-scaled eagle demonic beast with an elegant yet strange four-foot tall appearance, its jet black scales glistening, fixed the puppet beast with a cold, death-like gaze.</p><p></p><p>Although it didn't make a sound or move, if Su Yu gave the order, it would definitely deliver a fatal blow to the black thing.</p><p></p><p>These two didn't have enough intelligence to understand that this was a puppet beast crafted by their master, not an enemy.</p><p></p><p>"You're asking for trouble. Even I might not be able to deal with this thing unless I use talismans and such...but using talismans against puppet beasts would probably have limited effect too."</p><p></p><p>Under the eaves, Su Yun, with silver-white hair draped over her shoulders in a gray robe, looked at the puppet beast and marveled, "If I faced it, I'd rather trap it and immediately flee. This thing's body is comparable to a mid-grade defensive magical artifact!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the criticism from his master, Su Yu just smiled without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>He actually wanted to get used to the power levels of different cultivation realms. Since starting his cultivation, he had only personally experienced it once.</p><p></p><p>By understanding the power of different realms, he wouldn't panic when facing them in the future.</p><p></p><p>While Su Yun was satisfied with the puppet beast's strength, she had trouble accepting its cost.</p><p></p><p>Over the past two years, Su Yu had crafted thirteen puppet beasts in total.</p><p></p><p>From low first level to peak top first level puppet beasts, he spent two to three thousand low-grade spirit stones, especially this one in front of them which used materials worth nearly a thousand low-grade spirit stones - extravagant indeed.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It was terrifying. </p><p></p><p>If it wasn't like this, Su Yun really wanted Su Yu to refine a few more puppets.</p><p></p><p>Su Yun and Su Yu chatted idly for a moment before leaving.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu waved his hand to put away the puppet beasts, glanced at the Fire Ape and Black Scaled Eagle, and sighed lightly. </p><p></p><p>Over these two years, he had successfully broken through one cycle of the six cycles of the Cangmu Suiting cultivation method, reaching the 6th level of Qi Refining Realm. As for the 108 Forms Body Refining Technique of the Alligator Demon, he had broken through to the 8th level, greatly enhancing his strength.</p><p></p><p>However, he was already thirty years old this year. Fourteen years had passed since he was eliminated from the selection of disciples to join the Cloud Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, he might be fifty or sixty years old before he could lay the foundation.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty or thirty years...it won't take that long. Maybe in another eight or ten years, the Fire Ape and Black Scaled Eagle can be cultivated into second-grade demonic beasts," Su Yu pondered silently, then felt a bit of a headache.</p><p></p><p>Because these two fellows had bigger and bigger appetites, and raising two beast tamers was already becoming a bit much for him.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>This was mainly because he had fallen into the trap of puppet beasts.  </p><p></p><p>Plus the resources consumed by his own cultivation of spiritual power and body refining techniques.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, almost all the spirit stones Su Yu had saved up had been poured into this.</p><p></p><p>Normally he still had to sell talismans and even puppet beasts under the table just to barely maintain a balance of income and expenditure.</p><p></p><p>"I need to find a way to expand, otherwise for the future second-grade puppet beasts..." Su Yu pondered. The scale of Cloud Mountain Town was still a bit small. To continue like this, if he wanted a better cultivation environment, he would have to consider changing locations.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, your letter," a young maidservant brought him a letter.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu took the letter and opened it, immediately overjoyed: "Preparing to lay the foundation...good news!"</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>Su Zhi, Chen Sisi, and Su Qingyi came to the Pill Pavilion. Su Zhi was less than half a month older than Su Yu, but she was already thirty years old.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Zhi's current appearance was not much different from back then, still looking like a young girl.</p><p></p><p>Her cultivation had reached the 9th level of the Qi Refining Realm.  </p><p></p><p>Chen Sisi was two years younger than Su Zhi. Her appearance had changed a bit, but she had become more mature and charming. If Su Zhi was still a young girl, then Chen Sisi was a married lady of the sect, with a technique to maintain her youthful appearance.</p><p></p><p>Chen Sisi's cultivation was a bit behind, currently at the 8th level of the Qi Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, there was Su Qingyi...he had changed quite a bit. His body had become fatter, he had lost one arm, and the once rather handsome young man now seemed to be developing a middle-aged potbelly. Although he tried to hide and conceal it, the gloomy look on his face was still visible.</p><p></p><p>It seemed the injuries he had suffered back then had a major impact on him.</p><p></p><p>His current cultivation level was the 7th level of the Qi Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>After some casual chat, Su Zhi said, "The demonic dao has been rampant recently. I have selected one at the 9th level of Qi Refining to complete a sect mission. Combined with the contribution points I had accumulated before, it's barely enough to redeem a Foundation Establishment Pill."</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully everything goes smoothly."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu smiled and took out some things his family had asked him to prepare, including talismans, pills, and even a top-grade first-level puppet beast.</p><p></p><p>The family had spent spirit stones and resources, and when Su Zhi was about to establish her foundation, they would naturally help her along the way. Su Yu had no objections.</p><p></p><p>With the spirit stones and resources from the family, he could at least work on two top-grade first-level puppet beasts.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he not lose out, but he also profited.</p><p></p><p>After all, his true success rate in refining things was extremely high.</p><p></p><p>He was the only one who knew this point.</p><p></p><p>And once Su Zhi successfully broke through to the Foundation Establishment Realm, with the backing of a Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Cloud Sword Sect, plus the family's Fifth Elder who was also in the Foundation Establishment Realm, their Su Family could be considered a major cultivating family within the Cloud Sword Sect's domain.</p><p></p><p>Even the forces of the Huang Family would have to carefully weigh the pros and cons when dealing with the Su Family.</p><p></p><p>The Su Family had invested a lot in Su Zhi, with the aim of pushing her to the Foundation Establishment Realm to become the family's backing.</p><p></p><p>Now, whether the Su Family's power could rise to the next level depended on this final push.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

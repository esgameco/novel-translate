        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The fire ape cub seemed to have undergone a slight metamorphosis under the nourishment of the Qingmu Suizhou Gong's magic power. Its temperament was not as violent, and its intelligence greatly increased. </p><p></p><p>This metamorphosis surprised and delighted both Su Yu and Elder Su Yun.</p><p></p><p>If the fire ape had no risk of going out of control, it would absolutely be an excellent second-grade demonic beast of bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Its ferocious power would not disappoint.</p><p></p><p>In the backyard.</p><p></p><p>Whether Su Yu was refining pills or cultivating, the fire ape cub would follow him closely, absorbing the aura of magic power from Su Yu's body, as well as the celestial and earthly spiritual qi gathered around him.</p><p></p><p>With Su Yu, a pill refiner capable of refining first-grade medium-quality spirit pills, the fire ape cub lacked nothing to eat.</p><p></p><p>As long as the fire ape cub could bear it, the perfect-grade hundred-beast pills could be eaten like meals.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, the fire ape cub's growth rate was almost twice as fast as normal.</p><p></p><p>When the Fifth Elder Su Bin came out of seclusion after half a month, a subtle fluctuation of celestial and earthly spiritual qi emanated from the center of Yunshan Town, and cultivators who sensed this fluctuation couldn't help but look over there, discussing it in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"It's from the core cave abode of Yunshan!"</p><p></p><p>"This fluctuation, someone must have succeeded in breaking through to the Foundation Establishment realm. I heard that two Foundation Establishment pills appeared at the previous auction. Someone must have used them to succeed in their breakthrough!"</p><p></p><p>"Who could it be? The Foundation Establishment realm, damn, my old friend Hu has been stuck at the ninth level of the Qi Condensation realm for twenty years and still sees no hope of breaking through!"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that of the two Foundation Establishment pills, one was bought by a family called Su for five thousand two hundred low-grade spirit stones, and the second one went for an even higher price, bought by the Yu Family for five thousand eight hundred low-grade spirit stones. The Yu Family has already left, so it must be someone from the Su Family."</p><p></p><p>"Over five thousand low-grade spirit stones, sheesh, I could stay in this town for a lifetime and probably not earn that much!"</p><p></p><p>People in the town were discussing it endlessly, mostly with envy and jealousy.</p><p></p><p>It had been a long time since any Foundation Establishment pills had appeared in Yunshan Town.</p><p></p><p>It was too difficult for ordinary people to break through to the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps going to larger towns like Baiyue Immortal City would provide more opportunities.</p><p></p><p>At the Su Family Pill Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Su Mengshan and Su Bin returned from the core area, and seeing the great change in Su Bin's aura, which had become extremely formidable, the members of the Su Family like Su Yun and Su Yu were all very excited.</p><p></p><p>This was the Foundation Establishment realm!</p><p></p><p>The Su Family had been lacking someone at the Foundation Establishment realm to preside over them.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with the Su Family's first-grade spirit vein and accumulated resources like spirit-attracting powder, such a foundation would eventually become a disaster for the Su Family.</p><p></p><p>Because without the strength to guard such wealth, it would be a calamity.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, you go back first. I'll seclude myself for a while longer."</p><p></p><p>"When I return, everything will end and get better."</p><p></p><p>Su Bin's tone was very calm.</p><p></p><p>But in the eyes of Su Mengshan, Su Yun, and even Su Yu and the other Su Family members, there flashed a hint of cold intent and killing intent, and they sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>As they had said before, the Su Family occupied a first-grade spirit vein and had the foundation of a blessed land. Time and opportunity were on the Su Family's side.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that their strength was inferior to the Lin Family, but rather that they didn't want to bother with those mad dogs.</p><p></p><p>Once the Su Family transformed their foundation and opportunity into strength and achieved a realm ascension, dealing with the Lin Family would be like crushing an ant.</p><p></p><p>This was the time for the Su Family to settle accounts.</p><p></p><p>"The Lin Family has been jumping around for years. I've tolerated them for a long time," Su Mengshan sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>After sneering coldly, Su Yun's expression returned to his usual emotionless, icy 'poker face' look, and he said indifferently, "Whatever should be ours will be ours, and whatever should come will come."</p><p></p><p>Su Mengshan left the town first and returned to Jiangcheng's Cangshan Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Su Bin remained at the Pill Pavilion to begin secluding himself in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Breaking through the Foundation Establishment realm was just the beginning. To truly elevate one's strength qualitatively, one had to cultivate even more powerful spells, or even switch to better magical artifacts. </p><p></p><p>However, it was unknown whether it was because the Lin family found out that the Su family obtained a Foundation Establishment pill, and that someone in Yunshan Town had successfully broken through to the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later, before Su Bin had returned to Jiangcheng, news came from the family clan. </p><p></p><p>The Lin family had fled Jiangcheng overnight, relocating their entire clan.</p><p></p><p>Their direction—</p><p></p><p>Was towards the Bai family in Fengcheng.</p><p></p><p>The family patriarch Su Peng led people to ambush the Lin family, but only managed to stop a small portion of their cultivators, while the rest abandoned their ancestral lands and escaped successfully.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu inwardly felt regretful, as the Fifth Elder had still not emerged from seclusion, leaving him powerless in this matter.</p><p></p><p>Every day, he diligently cultivated the Qingmu Suixun Gong, the Alligator Demon's 108 Body Refining Techniques, and two spell techniques.</p><p></p><p>Apart from those, he had not attempted any top-grade first-level spirit pills in pill refinement, instead continuing to improve his mastery of methods for mid-grade first-level and lower-grade spirit pills.</p><p></p><p>Before his cultivation base improved, it would not be a good idea to hastily attempt refining top-grade first-level spirit pills.</p><p></p><p>In his spare time from pill refinement, Su Yu also began practicing talisman drawing, expanding his side profession towards becoming a talisman master.</p><p></p><p>It only took two months before Su Yu successfully drew his first low-grade first-level talisman.</p><p></p><p>If this speed was known, it would probably shock other talisman masters.</p><p></p><p>With the proficiency panels available, Su Yu had no difficulty in practicing and improving these side professions.</p><p></p><p>Su Bin emerged from seclusion after three months.</p><p></p><p>When he learned that the Lin family had fled Jiangcheng and relocated near the Bai family in Fengcheng, Su Bin merely let out a scornful laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Fleeing? Who do they think they are?"</p><p></p><p>"Do they really think having a junior marry into the Bai family would make the Bai family unconditionally shelter them?"</p><p></p><p>Su Bin shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Although the Bai family had some strength, it was not to the point where he would be wary of them.</p><p></p><p>If it was the Yu family from Heiquan Mountain intervening, he might have given it some thought, but the Bai family of Fengcheng—a murderous glint flashed in Su Bin's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the Lin family had used so many talismans against the Su family, and he had yet to settle that score with the Bai family!</p><p></p><p>"I'll head back first and deal with the Lin family matter myself." Su Bin left Yunshan Town.</p><p></p><p>With Su Bin at the Foundation Establishment realm, there was no need for Su Yu or Su Yun to get involved in this.</p><p></p><p>Less than a month after Su Bin returned, news about the Lin family arrived.</p><p></p><p>Su Bin went alone and found the Lin family, using his dual earth and wood elemental spells to exterminate the entire clan, except for Lin Danlang who had married into the Bai family. The Lin family had no survivors.</p><p></p><p>The Lin family's ancestral grounds of Lingyue Lake in Jiangcheng also fell into the hands of the Su family.</p><p></p><p>Lingyue Lake produced a type of early first-grade spirit creature called the Moonlight Fish.</p><p></p><p>Although not as effective for cultivation as low-grade spirit stones, the Moonlight Fish was prized for its delicious taste, a delicacy on the tongue.</p><p></p><p>The Lin family's ability to support their vast household of over a hundred cultivators depended on the Moonlight Fish from Lingyue Lake.</p><p></p><p>Su Bin's annihilation of the Lin family enraged Fengcheng's Bai family, and an elder of the Bai family at the Foundation Establishment realm came out to battle Su Bin.</p><p></p><p>When another Bai family Foundation Establishment cultivator intended to join, Su Bin calmly retreated, and the Bai family could not stop him.</p><p></p><p>Although this incident caused the Bai family to lose face, the now exterminated Lin family was not significant enough for the Bai family to go to any lengths to take action against the Su family.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, the Bai family currently did not have much energy to deal with the Su family.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Yu inwardly marveled: "Fifth Granduncle is truly formidable."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The sun had just risen, and purple qi came from the east. </p><p></p><p>Su Yu sat cross-legged in front of the window, grasping a low-grade spirit stone to absorb spiritual energy and cultivate. The power of the Wutong Qingmu Mantra within his body was as steady as the water in an old deep well, circulating without the slightest ripple.</p><p></p><p>At one point, a blue radiance flashed across Su Yu's body, and the dormant power in his dantian finally stirred.  </p><p></p><p>In an instant, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth from all directions converged, forming a small surge.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's aura quietly elevated to the third level of the Refining Qi Realm.  </p><p></p><p>Half an hour later.</p><p>The low-grade spirit stone in Su Yu's hand shattered into dust, falling through the gaps between his fingers. The spiritual energy of heaven and earth that had surged and gathered around him also returned to calm.</p><p></p><p>He slowly opened his eyes and murmured, "I broke through."</p><p></p><p>With his mind focused, lines of words appeared before his eyes:</p><p></p><p>【Name: Su Yu.】</p><p>【Cultivation: Third Level of Refining Qi Realm.】  </p><p>【Lifespan: 18/100.】</p><p>【Cultivation Methods: Wutong Qingmu Mantra (Third Level, Proficiency 0.01%), Crocodile Demon's 108 Body Refining Techniques (Fourth Level, Proficiency 69.1%).】</p><p>【Spells: Wood Vine Technique (Mastered), Spirit Nurturing Technique (Mastered), Spirit Javelin Technique (Mastered), Spirit Storing Technique (Proficiency 36.8%).】</p><p></p><p>It had been nearly two and a half years since returning from the Cloud Sword Sect, and his cultivation had broken through to the third level of the Refining Qi Realm.</p><p></p><p>His talent could not be compared to Su Zhi and Su Qing Yi.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Yu was not in a hurry. Currently, his cultivation progress could not match Su Zhi and others, but on the long path of immortal cultivation, when he reached higher realms, he would surpass everyone with the advantage of having no bottleneck in his proficiency panel.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the third level of the Refining Qi Realm put Su Yu in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the proficiency panel, Su Yu's gaze fell on the Body Refining Technique as he pondered, "The progress in cultivating the Body Refining Technique has slowed down a lot this year."</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Su Yu opened his spatial bag and saw that he had accumulated over 130 low-grade spirit stones, making a decision.</p><p></p><p>"I need to find an opportunity to go to the Cloud Mountain Town Market."</p><p></p><p>The Pharmacy Garden organized merchant caravans to the Cloud Mountain Town Market every month, with high standards and powerful clan cultivators as escorts.</p><p></p><p>If he went with the merchant caravan, it would be much safer.</p><p></p><p>Over this past year,</p><p>The spiritual energy of heaven and earth in the Pharmacy Garden had become nearly one-tenth more concentrated, and it was almost certain that a first-grade spiritual vein had appeared beneath the garden.  </p><p></p><p>Now they were just waiting for the clan to find a geomancer to locate the dragon vein and set up a grand formation, which would create a cultivation paradise.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was just the lowest first-grade spiritual vein paradise, it would be a priceless treasure for the Su Family.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, geomancers were hard to find, and the clan was still seeking information.</p><p></p><p>'If it becomes a paradise, my cultivation speed should be able to increase,' Su Yu looked forward to it eagerly.</p><p></p><p>Even if it only increased by half, the time saved in long-term cultivation would still be considerable.</p><p></p><p>The next morning,</p><p>Su Yu woke up from his cultivation holding a low-grade spirit stone. Looking at the proficiency panel, he could now complete his daily Wutong Qingmu Mantra cultivation in just over two hours.</p><p></p><p>"Proficiency increased by 0.12%," Su Yu pondered. "Even cultivating with low-grade spirit stones every day, it would take nearly three years to break through from the third to the fourth level of the Refining Qi Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Well, to be precise, it's a little over two years, two years and two or three months."</p><p></p><p>Nearing the end of the month, Su Yu set up ten beast-luring powder traps in the Pharmacy Garden that night and got lucky.</p><p></p><p>Six rock rats were caught, including two at the mid first-grade spirit beast level.</p><p></p><p>The next day,</p><p>Su Yu brought these spirit beasts to the Pharmacy Building, where the Third Elder Su Chang was tallying accounts with several senior clan members, preparing for the spirit medicine shipment at month's end.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Yu enter, Su Chang smiled at once, "Ah, our Pharmacy Garden's spirit beast hunter has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>The other elders laughed upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Suyou nodded in greeting towards Suyu.</p><p></p><p>Over the past year, Suyou would occasionally hunt the rock rats, keeping the population of these demonic beasts in the medicine garden below a tolerable level. </p><p></p><p>Suyou's reputation had also spread throughout the medicine garden. His ability to break through to the third level of Qi Refining Realm within a year was inseparable from the resources obtained by hunting the rock rats.</p><p></p><p>Suyou respectfully handed over the sack in his hand and said, "These are from last night's hunt, six rock rats."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Suchang was immediately a bit surprised, "Six?"</p><p></p><p>He looked at Suyou in astonishment. Previously, the most Suyou had brought was five rock rats each time.  </p><p></p><p>This was the first time exceeding that limit.</p><p></p><p>Suchang opened the sack and exclaimed, "Ah, there are even two mid-stage rock rat demonic beasts!"</p><p></p><p>The other elders were not surprised, but smiled at Suyou saying, "With him in our medicine garden, the plague of these rock rats disrupting the spiritual veins will not rise."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Suchang's delight, Suyou quickly mentioned his request to join the merchant caravan heading to Yunshan Market Town.</p><p></p><p>Suchang pondered for a moment and nodded in agreement, "Alright, but once you join the merchant caravan, you must follow orders and ensure the safety of the caravan."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Suchang gave Suyou six low-grade spirit stones for the rock rats.</p><p></p><p>As usual, there were no spirit beast cores from the two mid-stage demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>Including the value of the materials, it totaled seventy-eight low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"Come here early the day after tomorrow," Suchang instructed.</p><p></p><p>Transporting spirit medicines was not done using such primitive methods as horse-drawn carriages. After all, Suyou had received a qiankun bag as a reward for killing a junior member of the Lin family. Wouldn't they use qiankun bags or even qiankun rings to transport the spirit medicines?</p><p></p><p>Early the next morning, when Suyou arrived at the medicine building, there were already ten cultivators waiting.</p><p></p><p>The leader was even an elder of the family at the seventh level of the Qi Refining Realm, named Su Jingbang, around Suyou's grandfather's generation.</p><p></p><p>He had been in charge of transporting goods from the medicine garden to Yunshan Market Town for over ten years.</p><p></p><p>"You're here? Then let's go."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Suyou's arrival, Su Jingbang smiled slightly and nodded. The other nine cast curious glances at Suyou, the medicine garden's 'rock rat nemesis' they had heard about.</p><p></p><p>Including Suyou, there were eleven cultivators in total.  </p><p></p><p>They did not directly fly on instruments to Yunshan Market Town. Not only was their spiritual power insufficient, but even if it was enough, they would not dare to be so ostentatious.</p><p></p><p>What if they exhausted too much spiritual power midway and encountered bandits?</p><p></p><p>So they rode spirit horses to Yunshan Market Town instead.</p><p></p><p>The journey went smoothly, and even the rival Lin family did not ambush them.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, the group safely arrived outside the gates of Yunshan Market Town at the base of Cloud Sword Sect's mountain.</p><p></p><p>To enter the market town, each person had to pay one low-grade spirit stone. </p><p></p><p>Unless staying overnight in the town, one could only remain inside until nightfall before having to leave and could not linger on the streets.</p><p></p><p>After paying the entrance fees, Su Jingbang said, "Let's go to the Pill Pavilion first. Then we'll stay overnight in the market town and leave to return tomorrow afternoon. You're free to do as you wish in the meantime."</p><p></p><p>The market town was huge, built into a mountain ridge and enveloped by layers of great formations. There were also many spirit fields in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Rumor had it that beneath this market town was a branch of the spiritual vein under Cloud Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>But even if it was just a branch, this was still a second-grade spiritual vein, far stronger than the first-grade one discovered beneath the Su Family's medicine garden.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the market town, Suyou could sense the difference in the density of spiritual qi between heaven and earth. Staying here for a day would increase his cultivation progress by over ten percent compared to the medicine garden.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

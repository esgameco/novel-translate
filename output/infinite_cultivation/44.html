        <h1>Chapter 44</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In the past, Su Yu did not pay much attention to how the Lin family was destroyed, and he was not even familiar with Lin Danling himself. He had only seen him once and heard about him once. </p><p></p><p>The time he saw Lin Danling was more than a decade ago when he participated in the entrance test for disciples of the Yunjian Sect.</p><p></p><p>That time, Lin Danling successfully entered the Yunjian Sect.</p><p></p><p>The next time he heard about Lin Danling was when Lin Danling married into the Bai family of Fengcheng, marrying the over 400-pound second young lady of the main branch.</p><p></p><p>And then now.</p><p></p><p>He was completely killed by Su Yu's Fire Cloud Arrow Talisman.</p><p></p><p>Not long after.</p><p></p><p>The law enforcement officers of Yunshan Town came and confirmed Lin Danling's identity. Only then did Su Yu learn that Lin Danling had actually been expelled from the Yunjian Sect six years ago because he tried to steal the sect's core true martial arts manual.</p><p></p><p>This—</p><p></p><p>Su Yu was speechless after learning this.</p><p></p><p>An outer disciple wanted to steal the core martial arts manual from the Yunjian Sect, what was he thinking?</p><p></p><p>However, he thought that the destruction of the Lin family was probably around that time.</p><p></p><p>Affected by this shock, it was normal for Lin Danling to have a momentary lapse of judgment.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu collected Lin Danling's qiankun bag and magic treasures, then went to the Heavenly Book Pavilion to take a look around and ask if they had any second-grade talisman inheritances for sale.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Book Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The old man still looked the same as more than a decade ago. Seeing Su Yu, there was a strange look in his eyes as he praised, "Good boy, your cultivation method really preserves your youthful appearance."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu smiled, "I remember when I first came to the Heavenly Book Pavilion, you looked the same as now."</p><p></p><p>The old man laughed heartily, "I'm old, old. I don't have many years left to live."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu probed, "What about the second-grade talisman inheritance?"</p><p></p><p>The old man shook his head slightly and pointed to the area with the ancient jade boxes, "There might be some there. Why don't you try your luck?"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu: "..."</p><p></p><p>"Goodbye then."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the old man was unwilling to share it, Su Yu turned and left.</p><p></p><p>The old man watched Su Yu's departing back and shook his head slightly with some regret. He knew that Su Yu's pill concocting talent could be considered demonic.</p><p></p><p>But his cultivation talent—</p><p></p><p>Was simply unsightly.</p><p></p><p>More than thirty years old, yet only at the sixth level of Qi Condensation realm.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, forming a foundation in this lifetime would be difficult, let alone forming a Pill Body. Perhaps he would have no hope of that in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Without even the possibility of forming a Pill Body, how could he obtain the Heavenly Book Pavilion's inheritance?</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Book Pavilion only accepts demonic talents!</p><p></p><p>Cultivation talent is the most basic and important requirement, and then one must also master one of the other hundred arts of immortal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Failing to meet any one requirement means being unqualified to become a disciple of the Heavenly Book Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Back at the Pill Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu was not particularly disappointed. He just went to see if there was an opportunity to obtain an inheritance. Since the Heavenly Book Pavilion did not have one, he would find another way.</p><p></p><p>He took out Lin Danling's qiankun bag and emptied out all its contents.</p><p></p><p>There was a pile of miscellaneous items, including all kinds of spirit herbs, poisons, and three evil cultivation manuals related to demonic and heretical paths.</p><p></p><p>Two of the manuals were very ordinary, but one could actually be cultivated to the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Danling endured for another twenty or thirty years, perhaps he really could form a foundation using this demonic cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>At that time—</p><p></p><p>Well.</p><p></p><p>At that time, it would be even easier for Su Yu to kill him, pitiful.</p><p></p><p>After glancing at the three demonic manuals, Su Yu disdainfully destroyed them, and then destroyed the rest of the miscellaneous items, clothes, poisons, and so on.</p><p></p><p>In the end, there were more than a hundred low-grade spirit stones left, as well as five ancient jade boxes.</p><p></p><p>There were two magic treasures, both mid-grade.</p><p></p><p>One was like an arrow-shaped blade.</p><p></p><p>The other was a set of eight Soul-Devouring Needles, a demonic magic treasure.</p><p></p><p>"These Soul-Devouring...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"The soul-binding needles are good stuff. Once they hit the target, they can shake the opponent's soul, absolutely a powerful weapon that can decide the course of a great battle." Suyu put away the items with satisfaction. Not bad. </p><p></p><p>This delivery person barely passed.</p><p></p><p>Those arrow-like blades were just so-so.</p><p></p><p>Having accepted the soul-binding needles, Suyu absorbed them into his dantian to cultivate them. His gaze fell on the five ancient jade boxes. </p><p></p><p>These ancient jade boxes still had quite a bit of dust on them, and judging from the marks, they looked more like things that Lin Danlang had scavenged from somewhere.</p><p></p><p>After taking a look, Suyu infused his spiritual power to disperse the residual restrictive aura from the five ancient jade boxes, opening them one by one.</p><p></p><p>The first one was empty. </p><p></p><p>The second one was also empty.</p><p></p><p>The third one, huh?</p><p></p><p>A gold paper as thin as a cicada's wings appeared before Suyu's eyes. Despite being weathered by endless years, this paper remained intact.</p><p></p><p>Just this alone made it extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Suyu was surprised and took it out.</p><p></p><p>When Suyu's spiritual sense fell on the paper, a loud boom shook his mind, and a vast inheritance of knowledge surged in.</p><p></p><p>At the very top were three big words:</p><p></p><p>[Golden Cicada Art]!</p><p></p><p>After Suyu regained his senses and calmed down, able to gradually recall the inheritance that had entered his mind, it took Suyu more than three hours to go through the inheritance. The more he looked at this thing, the more his heart pounded with shock.</p><p></p><p>This was a soul cultivation art.</p><p></p><p>Using one's soul to transform into a golden cicada, strengthening the power of the soul, and ultimately achieving the level of influencing one's spiritual power and physical body with the power of the soul.</p><p></p><p>For orthodox cultivation methods, this art had an unimaginable empowering effect.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it could even allow an originally mediocre genius to metamorphose into a prodigy.</p><p></p><p>As for the demonic path—</p><p></p><p>This Golden Cicada Art was simply a divine skill.</p><p></p><p>Compared to orthodox cultivation methods, the demonic path's cultivation speed was ten times faster, or even a hundred times faster.</p><p></p><p>But there would be a consequence, or rather, the defect of all demonic cultivation methods was an unstable foundation and chaotic spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>There might not be any problems in the early stages, but in the later stages, demonic cultivation methods could easily go awry, with the cultivator exploding their body at a rate a hundred or a thousand times higher than orthodox methods.</p><p></p><p>The early convenience of fast cultivation had to be paid back doubly later on!</p><p></p><p>However, the Golden Cicada Art could use the soul to influence one's spiritual power and physical body, gradually tempering one's spiritual power and physical body, making them as pure as a golden cicada's body.</p><p></p><p>One could say that once the Golden Cicada Art was cultivated, combined with demonic cultivation methods—</p><p></p><p>This thought arose in Suyu's mind, and for a moment, even he felt tempted, but he quickly crushed that idea.</p><p></p><p>He could never cultivate the demonic path!</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, this Golden Cicada Art cannot be known to others." Suyu's pupils constricted slightly.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, those demonic cultivators would go crazy.</p><p></p><p>Although in his view, this Golden Cicada Art was not something ordinary people could cultivate, and the difficulty did not lie in the foundation materials, but in the art itself.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how difficult, this art was indeed beyond imagination, not an ordinary object.</p><p></p><p>Suyu even felt that after cultivating the Golden Cicada Art, reaching the Nascent Soul stage would be a breeze.</p><p></p><p>"I'll try cultivating the introductory level first and see how much it can help my cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Suyu was extremely eager.</p><p></p><p>The last two ancient jade boxes were also empty, with only a bit of dust inside.</p><p></p><p>Time passed in a flash, and another half a year went by.</p><p></p><p>On this day.</p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>As Suyu was cultivating the Golden Cicada Art, silently and without a sound, he truly entered the art. A golden radiance flashed in all directions in his mind, and his originally illusory soul transformed into a golden cicada.</p><p></p><p>The radiance of the Golden Cicada Art was ethereal and intangible to the naked eye, permeating Suyu's body.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

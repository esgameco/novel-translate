        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Early that morning, led by the family master Su Peng, a group of Su family members followed an old man to the medicinal garden. From afar, he appeared to be an elderly man with white hair and a face full of wrinkles, exuding a rather mysterious aura. </p><p></p><p>Finding the dragon vein and establishing an auspicious land formation was a complicated task. In addition to constructing the array for a blessed land, this would require a very long period of time.</p><p></p><p>So after staying in the medicinal garden for half a day, the family master Su Peng left the medicinal garden and returned to Jiangcheng city.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu only took a glimpse when the old man arrived, and then continued with his daily work and cultivation in the medicinal garden. </p><p></p><p>For a first-level Geomancer to find the dragon vein and construct a blessed land formation would take at least a month.  </p><p></p><p>It could even take two to three months if the process was slower.</p><p></p><p>He was not overly curious, and understood the ways of Geomancers, so there was no need to pay too much attention.</p><p></p><p>Due to the arrival of the Geomancer, the family's only female elder, the Fourth Elder Su Ruosu, came to the medicinal garden to guard it together with the Third Elder.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual vein was the most important matter for the Su family next, and they could not be careless.</p><p></p><p>Half a month after the Geomancer arrived, inside a house.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu was grinding animal lure powder. During this period, he had collected several materials with sufficient age and wondered if he could hunt a late-stage first-level rock rat.  </p><p></p><p>He had tried before, but unfortunately failed to lure any out.</p><p></p><p>"I'll try again tonight," said Su Yu, increasing the dosage of medicine. Now the family had begun searching for the core of the spiritual vein and constructing the blessed land.</p><p></p><p>So he thought it might be good to hunt more rock rats recently, preferably completely wiping them out from this spiritual vein.</p><p></p><p>As his body refining cultivation improved, rock rats were no longer much help to him.  </p><p></p><p>At most, he could earn some spirit stones from the family for his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>And it could be estimated that in a little over a year, he would leave the medicinal garden to become a pill refining apprentice.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, he could not leave the rock rats there.</p><p></p><p>He painstakingly refined twenty doses of animal lure powder, five of which contained materials potent enough to lure and hunt late-stage first-level rock rats.</p><p></p><p>When night fell, Su Yu quietly left his house and went to a secluded area of the medicinal garden.  </p><p></p><p>He scattered the twenty doses of spirit rice mixed with animal lure powder in several locations.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to return to his room to wait, he suddenly caught a faint, almost imperceptible scent in the air.</p><p></p><p>This scent was somewhat familiar, similar yet different from the animal lure powder.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Su Yu frowned slightly, puzzled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Ding!"  </p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Before Su Yu could take half a step, a shrill ringing of bells reverberated through the entire medicinal garden. Accompanying the bell sounds that spread across the garden, the ground shook slightly.</p><p></p><p>Sensing this commotion, even though Su Yu did not know what was happening, he knew something was wrong in the medicinal garden!</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's expression changed. He wanted to rush back to the main mansion, as that was where the Third Elder, Fourth Elder were stationed, and all the Su family cultivators in the medicinal garden resided - the safest place in the garden.  </p><p></p><p>If it was not safe there, then he would be even less safe here.</p><p></p><p>But before he could go far, the sounds of rats scurrying came from all directions in the medicinal garden.  </p><p></p><p>Near Su Yu, two rock rats suddenly emerged from the ground. One was over a foot long, a rather powerful early first-level demonic beast. The other was barely two feet, already reaching the middle first-level demonic beast stage.</p><p></p><p>Under the dim moonlight, the two emerging rock rats were enraged, their eyes turning blood-red, emanating an extremely ferocious aura.</p><p></p><p>"Squeaksqueaksqueak!!!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as they surfaced, sensing the human aura from Su Yu, the two rock rats immediately charged at him.  </p><p></p><p>Their black fur blended perfectly into the night. The rock rats moved at an incredibly fast speed, charging right next to Su Yu in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Only then...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the eyes of the two rock-rats suddenly widened. Their body hair stood on end, as if they had encountered some terrifying ferocious beast. Their bodies trembled uncontrollably in fear. </p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the body refining power hidden deep within Su Yu's body erupted. His fists were enveloped in a bloody glow. A hazy red light shrouded his entire body. In the night, it was as if a monstrous crocodile spirit was unleashing its claws.</p><p></p><p>Bang! Bang! </p><p></p><p>The two fists struck the two rock-rats instantly. Intimidated by the aura from Su Yu, the rock-rats didn't even dare to dodge. Their bodies shuddered in horror as they took the two punches head-on. </p><p></p><p>Blood exploded into a mist. The sound of shattering bones inside the rock-rats could be heard. The rock-rats flew dozens of zhang away into another medicinal field, crashing and kicking up dirt, forming two pits.</p><p></p><p>The two rock-rats, including the mid-stage spirit beast, instantly lost their aura and were killed by a single punch each.</p><p></p><p>After killing the two rock-rat spirits, Su Yu finally observed the situation in the medicinal garden. As he looked around, his heart sank again.</p><p></p><p>"Screech! Screech!"</p><p></p><p>Enraged screeches of rock-rats came from all directions of the medicinal garden. It seemed the entire rock-rat spirit pack of the spirit vein had been provoked and lured out. At this moment, numerous spirit beasts charged towards the direction of the great manor.</p><p></p><p>Even though Su Yu had hunted rock-rats from time to time over the past year, the number of rock-rats emerging from underground at this moment was at least over two hundred.</p><p></p><p>There were even a few late-stage rock-rats with extremely terrifying auras.</p><p></p><p>Seeing those formidable late-stage rock-rat spirits leading the charge towards the manor, Su Yu's pupils constricted as fury rose in his heart. "Someone provoked the rock-rat spirit pack into a frenzy? Who did this?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Su Yu's mind flickered through various suspects.</p><p></p><p>First was the geomancer and his disciples who had recently arrived at the medicinal garden.</p><p></p><p>Next was the Lin family.  </p><p></p><p>Lastly, there might be a traitor within the Su family itself.</p><p></p><p>However, these thoughts merely flashed through Su Yu's mind. Seeing the countless rock-rat spirits attacking the manor, Su Yu's expression changed as he gritted his teeth and rushed towards the trap he had just set.</p><p></p><p>Twenty portions of beast-luring powder had been laid out, six of which had already been consumed by the enraged rock-rats that charged out, now lying dazed on the ground as if drunk.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu killed them all with a punch each.</p><p></p><p>The remaining fourteen portions of beast-luring powder, including four extra-strength ones, were all collected by Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>Swish!</p><p></p><p>Su Yu concealed his aura to the utmost, stealthily infiltrating towards the great manor without a sound.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Wood Cycle Cultivation Art he had recently switched to was extremely powerful in aura concealment. With his aura concealed, Su Yu's presence was like that of an ordinary tree.</p><p></p><p>Even rock-rats charging past nearby could not detect him.</p><p></p><p>At the great manor...</p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>Layer after layer of formations were activated, but not long after, one of the formation nodes exploded with a bang, the formation flag shattering.</p><p></p><p>Some formations lost effect entirely, while others had their power greatly reduced, teetering on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>The third elder Su Chang, who was overseeing the formations, turned deathly pale with a murderous look as he roared furiously, "Where is Geomancer Guo?!"</p><p></p><p>Swish!</p><p></p><p>The fourth elder Su Ruosu, still in the form of a beautiful woman, rushed over with an ugly expression, saying, "That Guo fellow and his disciples are nowhere to be found. The manor's formations were likely sabotaged by them."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this and considering a certain possibility, Su Chang's face changed again as he looked at the countless rock-rats charging from all directions.</p><p></p><p>"The Lin family? This is bad!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

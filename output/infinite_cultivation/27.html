        <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Earth Fire Ape Demonic Beast's egg caused an uproar at the auction scene. A second-tier demonic beast bloodline, this meant that at least half the chance existed for it to become a second-tier demonic beast upon maturity, with strength comparable to the Foundation Establishment realm. </p><p></p><p>The Earth Fire Ape demonic beast was notorious within the Cloud Sword Sect's domain, with its habitat named the Earth Fire Gorge.</p><p></p><p>No one had ever successfully tamed the Earth Fire Ape demonic beast before. Because the Earth Fire Ape had an extremely ferocious and violent temper, easily losing rationality and even killing its own master.</p><p></p><p>However, it could not be denied that the Earth Fire Ape's bloodline and strength were indeed formidable. </p><p></p><p>This demonic beast egg was estimated to be the work of the Yu Family from Black Rock Mountain. Perhaps the Yu Family wanted to try cultivating the Earth Fire Ape from a young age using the egg, but unfortunately, the plan ultimately failed, causing this demonic beast egg to prematurely hatch with innate deficiencies.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators in the main hall below discussed fervently. Some attempted to bid, but were indecisive.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu waited until the price reached five hundred low-grade spirit stones with no further increases before saying, "Five hundred and fifty."</p><p></p><p>The person calling out the bid from the small lounge on the second floor did not choose to continue after hearing Su Yu's bid.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu obtained the Earth Fire Ape demonic beast egg.</p><p></p><p>Su Yun looked at him bidding twice and said, "It seems you haven't been idle in accumulating wealth these past two years."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu respectfully said, "Thanks to Master's guidance."</p><p></p><p>Su Yun shook his head with a wry smile, "Your pill concoction talent is very high, the best I've seen in many years, even within the entire Cloud Sword Sect's domain."</p><p></p><p>"You just acquired a talisman master's inheritance. If you want to learn talisman crafting as well, you can, but don't let it hinder your pill concoction."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu repeatedly said, "Rest assured Master, it won't."</p><p></p><p>Su Yun nodded, his attention returning to the auction.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Foundation Establishment Pills, the auction also featured top-grade magic treasures that piqued the interest of both Su Yun and Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>However, neither participated in the bidding for the top-grade magic treasures.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu could not utilize top-grade magic treasures for the time being.</p><p></p><p>As for Su Yun, his target this time was the Foundation Establishment Pills, not top-grade magic treasures.</p><p></p><p>If they also vied for the top-grade magic treasures, then their goal would become too expansive.</p><p></p><p>The second-to-last item at the auction was two Foundation Establishment Pills. However, it was only after the auctioneer brought out the Foundation Establishment Pills that the crowd realized why these pills appeared at the auction.</p><p></p><p>The auctioneer said, "These are two slightly flawed Foundation Establishment Pills. Normal Foundation Establishment Pills can increase the breakthrough success rate by twenty percent, but these two can only increase it by about one and a half stages."</p><p></p><p>"The Foundation Establishment Pills will be auctioned separately. The starting bid for the first pill is two thousand low-grade spirit stones, with each subsequent bid increment no less than one hundred low-grade spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>"Three thousand low-grade spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, a voice immediately rang out from a lounge on the third floor, directly raising the bid by one thousand low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Hubbub.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators in the Qi Condensation realm down in the main hall were in an uproar, eyeing the Foundation Establishment Pill on stage greedily.</p><p></p><p>Especially some of the elderly cultivators.</p><p></p><p>This was a Foundation Establishment Pill after all.</p><p></p><p>"Are there any other bids?" The auctioneer excitedly shouted.</p><p></p><p>"Three thousand five hundred low-grade spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>A lounge on the second floor immediately called out a bid.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the first flawed Foundation Establishment Pill had its price bid up to four thousand six hundred low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>At this point, only two or three parties remained persistent, but their bids had become somewhat hesitant.</p><p></p><p>On the second floor, Su Yun said in a deep voice, "Five thousand."</p><p></p><p>This price caused the auction house to fall silent.</p><p></p><p>It was the highest bid in this auction so far, causing the ordinary participants below to gape in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>The person on the third floor hesitated for a long time before adding one hundred low-grade spirit stones just as the auctioneer was about to strike the hammer.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>But immediately after, Su Yun added another hundred, five thousand two hundred low-grade spirit stones. </p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Yun's determination, that person decisively gave up.</p><p></p><p>Su Yun took down the first Foundation Establishment Pill. </p><p></p><p>For the remaining auctions, Su Yun and Su Yu did not participate and left the private room to find the manager of the company. They handed over the spirit stones and immediately left with the items.</p><p></p><p>However, before the two could return to the Pill Pavilion, an angry shout came from the direction of the Yunshan Company: "Audacious!"</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The sounds of a great battle ensued.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, you two little brats also want to stop me?" An overbearing but extremely cold and uncomfortable voice came.</p><p></p><p>Su Yun's expression changed, and he turned to look, hurriedly saying: "Quick, leave! It's the Foundation Establishment realm!"</p><p></p><p>Su Yu was also startled.</p><p></p><p>A Foundation Establishment cultivator was attacking the Yunshan Company. It was fortunate they had left early, otherwise they might have been caught up in it.</p><p></p><p>The two quickly rushed back to the Pill Pavilion. The market's great formation had already been activated, but the battle over there was still intense, as if the market's great formation could not suppress the opponent.</p><p></p><p>Just as the two were nearing the Pill Pavilion, suddenly a cold light appeared, pointing straight at Su Yun's head.</p><p></p><p>Clang!</p><p></p><p>Golden light burst from Su Yun's body, activating a mid-grade defensive magic treasure that blocked the attacking magic treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, leave behind the Foundation Establishment Pill!" A figure wearing a cloak and a mask that could conceal their spiritual sense rushed out.</p><p></p><p>That aura, it was undoubtedly a ninth layer Qi Condensation cultivator.</p><p></p><p>This person was skilled in metal spells, and upon appearing, various spells attacked Su Yun, forcing him to retreat continuously.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, this person's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>"Teng!"</p><p></p><p>Two talisman papers were thrown out, and towering flames like raging dragons melted his attacks and pounced towards him.</p><p></p><p>The might of these at least top-grade first-rank fire elemental attack talismans.</p><p></p><p>This person was thrown into disarray by the two fire dragon flames, retreating dozens of zhang.</p><p></p><p>Just as the blazing dragon flames dispersed and that person was about to attack Su Yun again, his pupils suddenly constricted and he cursed under his breath.</p><p></p><p>Su Yun's expression was cold, holding over ten extremely powerful fire elemental attack talismans in his hands, full of killing intent as he stared at him coldly: "Come."</p><p></p><p>That person's face turned black: "..."</p><p></p><p>Shua!</p><p></p><p>Without the slightest hesitation, this person turned and ran.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu watched this battle from the side, especially when Master Su Yun held over ten talisman papers with a cold laugh, looking at the opponent, telling him to continue, that feeling was indescribable.</p><p></p><p>This was really too damnâ€”in line with an alchemist's fighting style.</p><p></p><p>True alchemists actually don't lack money.</p><p></p><p>Apart from using medicine against enemies, talismans, mechanisms, puppets, formations, etc., all can be means for alchemists.</p><p></p><p>Alchemists may not be strong themselves, but against any enemy, they are not the slightest bit weak.</p><p></p><p>Su Yun put away the talismans in his hands and said domineeringly yet calmly: "Let's go, we're going back."</p><p></p><p>Back at the Pill Pavilion, Su Yun activated the defensive formation.</p><p></p><p>The great battle outside didn't last long before ending, because right next to it was the Cloudsword Sect, causing a disturbance in Yunshan Market was a serious provocation of the Cloudsword Sect.</p><p></p><p>However, the person who took action was truly formidable, even under the joint efforts of the two Cloudsword Sect's Foundation Establishment cultivators guarding the market and the suppression of the formation, he still managed to escape.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, news spread that the final auction item at the Yunshan Company's auction was the remnant of the peerless magic treasure, the Tian Luo Umbrella.</p><p></p><p>And the person who took action was called Blood Saber Daoist, at the late Foundation Establishment realm, a demonic cultivator hunted by the Great Moon Palace, acting cruelly and unscrupulously, rampant and unbridled.</p><p></p><p>It was said that he successfully snatched away the remnant peerless magic treasure, the Tian Luo Umbrella.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

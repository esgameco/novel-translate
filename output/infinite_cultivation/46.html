        <h1>Chapter 46</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The one leading them was surprisingly Chen Sisi. Ever since the banquet after Su Zhu successfully formed her Natal Spiritual Soul, Su Yu had not seen her again. </p><p></p><p>Su Qingyi had defected from the Su Family and joined the demonic path, and Chen Sisi had also sent word to the Su Family, severing her Dao partner relationship with Su Qingyi.</p><p></p><p>Following Chen Sisi were two people. One of them was the white-haired Chen Family's Second Elder. </p><p></p><p>The other had jet-black hair and appeared to be in middle age, at the ninth level of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>Chen Sisi's cultivation had also reached the ninth level of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing Su Yu, Chen Sisi exchanged a smile with him and nodded slightly, saying, "Brother Yu."</p><p></p><p>"You know the Second Elder." Chen Sisi pointed to the other robust, nearly nine-foot-tall middle-aged man and said, "This is our Chen Family's Fourth Elder, Chen Kaiyon."</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, fellow Daoists," Su Yu said respectfully. "May I ask why you are looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Sisi said, "Brother Yu, my Chen Family would like two of those puppet beasts that Senior Sister Su Zhu previously had."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu's brows furrowed slightly. After pondering for a moment, he said, "Alright, two thousand low-grade spirit stones each."</p><p></p><p>This price was not cheap, on par with high-grade magic treasures.</p><p></p><p>However, the elderly Chen Family's Second Elder showed a slight smile and said, "Very well, thank you for your kindness, Young Friend Su."</p><p></p><p>Top-tier puppet beasts at the Natal Spiritual Soul stage were not something one could obtain simply by wanting them, let alone two of them. Even at auctions in Bai Yue Immortal City, one would likely need at least three thousand low-grade spirit stones to purchase a single one.</p><p></p><p>These were peak combat forces for the Qi Refining Realm that could serve a family for generations, merely requiring the consumption of spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>The Chen Family's Second Elder understood this, so he thanked Su Yu for his kindness, implying that the Chen Family remembered his favor and was not ungrateful.</p><p></p><p>The Chen Family immediately handed over four thousand low-grade spirit stones to Su Yu, displaying their wealth and affluence, which slightly moved Su Yu's heart.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that over the years, the Chen Family had managed to secure that Purple Gold Sand Spirit Vein and had made a small fortune.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the puppet beasts, the Chen Family agreed to collect them in a year.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, Chen Sisi and the others were about to take their leave, but Su Yu kept Chen Sisi behind for a casual chat.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu said, "Congratulations on reaching the ninth level of Qi Refining. Have you considered when you might form your Natal Spiritual Soul?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Sisi looked into Su Yu's clear, pure eyes devoid of any impurities and sighed, "If all goes well, perhaps in a year or two."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu smiled and said, "If you need any help, feel free to ask."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I'm referring to things like spirit pills, talismans, and the like."</p><p></p><p>If he could invest a few spirit pills, talismans, and other external objects in someone forming their Natal Spiritual Soul, as long as Chen Sisi succeeded, he would profit.</p><p></p><p>Just like now, when he sometimes needed second-grade materials, whether for pill refining, talisman crafting, puppet beast materials, or second-grade demonic beast blood essences for body cultivation techniques, he would ask Su Zhu for help collecting them.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the familial bond, this was also due to the favors Su Yu had done for Su Zhu in the past.</p><p></p><p>Without Su Zhu's assistance, it would not be easy for him to gather those materials.</p><p></p><p>Yun Shan Market Town was too small.</p><p></p><p>When he first came here over a decade ago, he thought it was quite large.</p><p></p><p>However, after staying here for a long time and gaining a thorough understanding of the surrounding cultivation world, Su Yu realized that Yun Shan Market Town was indeed small in scale.</p><p></p><p>The largest market town nearest to Cloud Sword Sect was Bai Yue Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>The scale of Bai Yue Immortal City was several times, perhaps even ten times, larger than Yun Shan Market Town.</p><p></p><p>It was said that beneath Bai Yue Immortal City ran a third-grade spirit vein, and deep within the city, there was even a third-grade spirit vein blessed land.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The cave dwellings above were rented out.</p><p></p><p><div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div></p><p></p><p>So in Baiyue Xian City, there were quite a number of scattered cultivators at the Foundation Establishment realm, second-grade pill refiners, talisman masters, and so on. </p><p></p><p>There were even some at the pseudo-dan realm, or third-grade pill refiners.</p><p></p><p>This was the difference between Yunshan Fang Market and Baiyue Xian City.</p><p></p><p>If Chen Sisi could also successfully establish her foundation, then having one more person at the Foundation Establishment realm would greatly benefit him, Su Yu.</p><p></p><p>After thanking them, Chen Sisi left with her clansmen.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Su Yu began collecting materials to refine two more of those ordinary top-grade first-level puppet beasts from before.</p><p></p><p>The material cost for one such puppet beast was around nine hundred low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>He could refine one in two to three months.  </p><p></p><p>The two puppet beasts could bring him a pure profit of over two thousand low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Su Yu was also collecting materials for the second-grade low-rank Kaiyuan Pill, which was equivalent to the 'Qi Refining Pill' for the Foundation Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>It was a very common second-grade pill, with relatively easy materials to collect.</p><p></p><p>However, over the course of half a year, Su Yu went through materials for ten Kaiyuan Pills before finally succeeding in refining a batch of second-grade low-rank Kaiyuan Pills. It really wasn't easy to refine second-grade pills with just the seventh layer of the Qi Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>Another half a year passed.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu had long since refined the two puppet beasts.</p><p></p><p>As for the second-grade low-rank pill Kaiyuan Pill, his success rate had improved to thirty to forty percent, with a proficiency of 32%.</p><p></p><p>He successfully advanced to become a second-grade low-rank pill refiner.</p><p></p><p>For this, he spent half of the profits from the two puppet beasts.</p><p></p><p>A year later, Chen Sisi appeared at the Fang Market Pill Pavilion to collect the two puppet beasts.</p><p></p><p>The following month, when Su Dajun, the clan member in charge of delivering spirit medicines, arrived, Su Yu learned about the situation with his clan and the Chen clan from him.</p><p></p><p>Su Dajun said, "Our clan has a top-grade first-level puppet beast refined by an elder before. The Chen clan bought two more, making it a total of three top-grade first-level puppet beasts that even non-Foundation Establishment cultivators can hardly harm."</p><p></p><p>"With the ferocity of these three puppet beasts, our clan joined forces with the Chen clan to attack the Bai clan of Feng City's resource ground."  </p><p></p><p>"The remaining Bai clan elder at the third layer of Foundation Establishment was held off by elders from our clan and the Chen clan. The three puppet beasts and elders from both clans killed and routed the Bai clan's cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"In one battle, the Bai clan suffered heavy losses of two elders at the ninth layer of Qi Refining and nearly thirty fallen cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"Now, we have occupied that resource ground, and the Feng City Bai clan has retreated in defeat with devastating losses."</p><p></p><p>Su Dajun spoke with great excitement and passion when recounting these events.</p><p></p><p>The Feng City Bai clan had been feuding with their Su clan for many years.  </p><p></p><p>Back when the Lin clan wanted to seize the Su clan's spirit vein territory, the Feng City Bai clan had lent a hand to the Lin clan.</p><p></p><p>Later, during the incident with the Chen clan, the Feng City Bai clan also caused the Su clan to lose many clansmen.</p><p></p><p>Su Qingyi even lost an arm because of the Feng City Bai clan, which led to his heart becoming twisted and him defecting to the demonic path.</p><p></p><p>It was time for their Su clan and the Chen clan to settle these bloody scores and debts with the Feng City Bai clan!</p><p></p><p>Su Yu was equally delighted upon hearing this. Defeating the Feng City Bai clan and gaining a resource ground was indeed good news.</p><p></p><p>The wheels of fortune turn.</p><p></p><p>The arrogant Feng City Bai clan had once oppressed their Su clan and Chen clan.  </p><p></p><p>Now it was time for them to repay the debt!</p><p></p><p>However, after the initial delight, Su Yu thought of something and expressed some concern, "What about the Huang clan of Guanlan Mountain?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>【Cultivation Technique: Golden Cicada Art (First Layer, Proficiency 0.01%)】</p><p></p><p>The Golden Cicada Art has nine layers. After entering the first layer, Su Yu's spiritual soul transformed into a golden cicada pupa, enveloped by a layer of golden light barrier, like a cicada pupa. </p><p></p><p>Cultivating the Golden Cicada Art, Su Yu had a feeling of being immersed in the spiritual veins of an ice spring, his mind was tranquil, and his spiritual soul felt very comfortable under the reflection of the golden light.</p><p></p><p>Even his physical body felt very comfortable under the reflection of this layer of golden light.</p><p></p><p>However, the golden light from the newly learned first layer of the Golden Cicada Art only lasted less than thirty breaths before being completely consumed.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu woke up from that extraordinary state, pondering.</p><p></p><p>With the newly learned first layer of the Golden Cicada Art, under the reflection of that golden light, his cultivation speed increased by about one-tenth.  </p><p></p><p>No noticeable changes could be seen in his spiritual soul, physical body, or spiritual power for now.</p><p></p><p>But under the illumination of that golden light, he could sense that the impurities in his spiritual soul, physical body, and spiritual power were being purified and disappearing.</p><p></p><p>The effect might not seem significant in the short term, but if he cultivated under the illumination of that golden light for a long time, he would definitely undergo a transformation.</p><p></p><p>"The Golden Cicada Art still needs to be cultivated and improved, otherwise that bit of spiritual power will be easily consumed," Su Yu shook his head slightly at the proficiency of 0.01% for the first layer he had just learned.</p><p></p><p>Although he had only experienced less than thirty breaths, cultivating under the illumination of the golden light of the Golden Cicada Art did feel very comfortable.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing it, he didn't want to stop.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, someone wants to refine a first-grade superior spirit pill," Su Rui'an came to the back courtyard of the Pill Pavilion and respectfully said from outside the room.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, coming."</p><p></p><p>Su Yu went out to take care of things for a moment and accepted an order for refining a first-grade superior spirit pill.</p><p></p><p>While refining the spirit pill, he also explained the pill refining techniques to the seven members of the Pill Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Su Rui'an had a mediocre talent for pill refining, but under Su Yu's continuous guidance, he could now refine first-grade inferior spirit pills.</p><p></p><p>The others had even less talent for pill refining.</p><p></p><p>But Su Yu felt that before he left, it wouldn't be difficult to train two first-grade superior pill refiners for the Su Family.</p><p></p><p>The affairs of the Pill Pavilion were not busy; Su Yu didn't need to show up more than five times a month.</p><p></p><p>For the rest of the time, Su Yu spent it cultivating, as well as researching spirit pills, talismans, and puppetry.</p><p></p><p>With the inheritance of a second-grade inferior pill refiner, although Su Yu's current spiritual power was still insufficient to support refining second-grade inferior spirit pills, he could still study the pill formulas in advance.</p><p></p><p>As for talismans, although he didn't have a second-grade inheritance, Su Yu had collected more than a dozen fragmentary ancient talismans over the years.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't find a suitable second-grade talisman master inheritance, he planned to research and try to create his own second-grade inferior talismans.</p><p></p><p>For puppetry, Su Yu was currently still unable to delve into second-grade puppet beasts, not only because of his cultivation level but also due to insufficient financial resources and materials.</p><p></p><p>He could only first study the top-tier first-grade puppet beasts and the second-grade inferior puppet beasts from the inheritance.</p><p></p><p>After thoroughly understanding them, when he felt confident, he could directly start making second-grade puppet beasts.</p><p></p><p>Time passed slowly.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Cicada Art was a bit difficult to cultivate, and the proficiency progressed slowly. However, as the proficiency of this technique increased, the duration he could sustain the Golden Cicada Art also gradually lengthened.</p><p></p><p>Under the influence of the Golden Cicada Art, the cultivation speed of the Cypress Wood Yearly Cycle Art and the Alligator Demon's One Hundred and Eight Body Refining Techniques had also improved significantly compared to before.</p><p></p><p>A year and a half later, the proficiency of the first layer of the Golden Cicada Art had barely reached 11%.</p><p></p><p>However, the Cypress Wood Yearly Cycle Art, under the influence of the Golden Cicada Art, had reached the seventh yearly cycle, one year faster than expected.</p><p></p><p>Another ring had deepened on Su Yu's body, indicating the growth of his yearly cycles.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation had finally reached the seventh layer of the Qi Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>He had entered the late stages of the Qi Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>After the breakthrough, Su Yu looked at the information on the proficiency panel.</p><p></p><p>【Name: Su Yu】</p><p>【Cultivation: Seventh Layer of Qi Refining Realm】</p><p>【Lifespan: 36/139</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>【Cultivation Techniques: Qingmu Suixuan Gong (one cycle of seven rotations, proficiency 0.04%), Alligator Demon's 108 Body Refining Techniques (8th layer, proficiency 98.62%), Blood Whale Devouring Moon Technique (1st realm, proficiency 0.01%), Golden Cicada Technique (1st layer, 11.03%)】</p><p></p><p>【Spells: Wood Vine Technique (Mastered), Spirit Nurturing Technique (Mastered), Spirit Spear Technique (Mastered), Spirit Storing Technique (Mastered)】  </p><p></p><p>"My lifespan increased by eleven years." Su Yu murmured, his eyes flashing with brilliance.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Qingmu Suixuan Gong cultivation technique was truly powerful.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary Qi Refining cultivators at the 9th layer, their lifespan was usually only around 120 years.</p><p></p><p>Before cultivating, with the Willow Wood Incantation of the Su Family, at the 9th layer of Qi Refining, one could possibly reach over 130 years of lifespan.</p><p></p><p>But with this Qingmu Suixuan Gong, even though he was only at the 7th layer of Qi Refining, his lifespan had already reached nearly 140 years.</p><p></p><p>This was lifespan.</p><p></p><p>Something countless cultivators dreamed of but could not obtain.</p><p></p><p>Once he reached the 9th layer of Qi Refining, his lifespan would be dozens of years more than ordinary cultivators at that level!</p><p></p><p>Dozens of years, during which he could accomplish so much.</p><p></p><p>If he could break through to the Foundation Establishment Realm after that, the lifespan gap would only grow larger.</p><p></p><p>By then, even if his enemies turned to ashes and danced on his grave, flaying his descendants and scattering their ashes would no longer be an empty threat.</p><p></p><p>On the proficiency panel, there was a long section for spells. Over the years, Su Yu had learned quite a few spells.</p><p></p><p>Such as the Sword Guiding Technique, Wind Evasion Technique, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Adding up all the big and small spells, there were nearly twenty of them, and he had mastered them all to perfection.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating these spells was not difficult. In Su Yu's view, the fundamentals for cultivators were still their cultivation level and spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>As long as the spells were sufficient, that was enough.</p><p></p><p>Two more months passed.</p><p></p><p>Su Yu successfully broke through to the 9th layer of the Alligator Demon's 108 Body Refining Techniques. After breaking through to the 9th layer, Su Yu attempted to re-accumulate the core power of the Blood Whale Devouring Moon Technique to its fullest, then unleashed it with full force.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of miles away from Yunshan Town, in a wilderness, Su Yu took the form of a humanoid alligator beast, his blood energy forming a giant claw.</p><p></p><p>He clashed it fiercely against a Dragon Eagle Puppet Beast.</p><p></p><p>The force of that clash caused the ground to crack open for a mile or two around. Countless trees fell, and giant boulders shattered.</p><p></p><p>A crater one hundred zhang in diameter was left at the site.</p><p></p><p>With the 9th layer of his Body Refining Technique combined with the pseudo-supernatural power of the Blood Whale Devouring Moon Technique at double strength, Su Yu's full force attack merely caused the Dragon Eagle Puppet Beast to retreat half a step.</p><p></p><p>After the attack, Su Yu quickly put away the Dragon Eagle Puppet Beast and slapped a few Concealment Talismans, Breath Concealing Talismans, and Divine Movement Talismans on himself before swiftly leaving.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>In less than a hundred breaths, several cultivators rushed over at extreme speed on their flying swords.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the huge crater and the devastation below, the inner disciples of the Cloud Sword Sect turned pale.</p><p></p><p>"The 9th layer of Qi Refining? No, with this level of power...could it be—the Foundation Establishment Realm!?"</p><p></p><p>"Quick, leave! Report to the Elders, let a Foundation Establishment Senior handle this!"</p><p></p><p>The few inner disciples of the Cloud Sword Sect were so frightened that they immediately fled on their swords, not daring to linger.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the delighted Su Yu returned to Yunshan Town. For several days, he adjusted his state, preparing to attempt refining a second-grade low-rank spirit pill.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a group of guests came to visit.</p><p></p><p>P.S. Regarding the questions about the Soul Devouring Needles, this magical treasure is set as a special one, targeting the soul aspect and being rather sinister and vicious. It is more commonly used by demonic cultivators, hence being called a demonic magical treasure.</p><p></p><p>(Begging for my life).</p><p></p><p>These Soul Devouring Needles are different from the previously mentioned Demon Soul Banner, which was refined using human lives and is undoubtedly a demonic treasure.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, the author mushroom thinks this explanation is plausible?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

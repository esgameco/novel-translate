        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Patriarch, you died so miserably..."</p><br /><p>"Master, don't come back to us, we will worship you on time..."</p><br /><p>The cry of sorrow lingered in Chen Luo's ears, and Chen Luo opened his eyes.</p><br /><p>Chen Luo sat up from the coffin, and a quaint spiritual hall came into view, and a little maid below was crying perfunctorily while burning paper money.</p><br /><p>The little maid below who was crying finally heard the movement, raised her head, and looked at Chen Luo.</p><br /><p>"Ah-"</p><br /><p>"It's not good, the head of the family is cheating the corpse..."</p><br /><p>Ignoring the little maid's terrified screams, Chen Luo struggled to digest the memories in his mind and quickly understood his situation.</p><br /><p>He crossed over to Chen Luo, who had the same name and surname in this world.</p><br /><p>Ahem, this unimportant memory should not be delved into.</p><br /><p>"But how did he die?" Chen Luo tried to recall the memories in his mind, and soon understood the beginning and end of the matter.</p><br /><p>At first, the prefectural magistrate thought it was a plague and sent Langzhong to check it out, but found that everything was normal. But people continue to die one by one.</p><br /><p>The Evil One, the Evil Dragon is also.</p><br /><p>is a ghost!</p><br /><p>Chen Luo saw that the ghost creature got into his dream, and in the dream, the ghost pulled out a three-foot-long tongue, wrapped it around his neck, and pulled hard, Chen Luo's head in the dream seemed to be strangled, and the outside body was also broken.</p><br /><p>Chen Luo fought a cold war, this kind of horror-like memory is better not to sit in a coffin and recall. He carefully climbed out of the coffin and sat down in a chair.</p><br /><p>Chen Luo began to try to recall and see if there was a solution.</p><br /><p>In his memory, Chen Fu also found the Daoist courtyard set up by the Daomen in Wan'an County, but the group of ox-nosed Taoist priests actually ran to participate in the Luo Tian Da Dip once in a jiazi, leaving only a few useless little Daoists to guard.</p><br /><p>There is no Tao, and there is a Buddha!</p><br /><p>Finally, there is Confucianism, which cultivates a mighty body of righteousness, and ghosts and gods. But the key is that you can only protect yourself, not others.</p><br /><p>"DING-"</p><br /><p>WAS UNRESPONSIVE.</p><br /><p>"System, host call..." Chen Luo's voice was a little anxious.</p><br /><p>There is no goldfinger!</p><br /><p>Not to mention being chased and killed by a ghost right now!</p><br /><p>"Could it be that the signal of the Spirit Hall is not good?" Chen Luo comforted himself and walked towards the outside of the Spirit Hall. But as soon as one foot stepped out of the threshold of the spiritual hall, a warm and fishy liquid came towards him, drenching him from head to toe. Chen Luo's vision instantly turned bright red, and he couldn't see clearly ahead for a while.</p><br /><p>Immediately afterwards, Chen Luo felt a pain in his back, as if he had been knocked on a stick, stumbled forward two steps, and fell to the ground. At this time, it was the old voice again who shouted: "The corpse is most afraid of coffin nails, UU reads books www.uukanshu.com Take the coffin nail and nail him!</p><br /><p>"It's over, I'm going to be Jesus!" Chen Luo sighed in his heart, and at the last moment when he lost consciousness, he suddenly heard a crisp female voice in his ears-"Stop me!"</p><br /><p>Chen Luo seemed to have had a dream.</p><br /><p>At this time, a loud and distant voice echoed in Chen Luo's mind:</p><br /><p>"You refine the Yang God and he cultivate Buddha, and the red dust has me laughing to the sky."</p><br /><p>Chen Luo seemed to be poured from the head by a basin of cold water, full of a stirring spirit, at this time, he clearly felt that there was an extra paragraph in his mind, that is-</p><br /><p>Ghost catcher, Zhong Kui!</p>

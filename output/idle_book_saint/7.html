        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The tip of the sword pressed against Chen Luo's throat, and Chen Luo could feel the cool breath coming from the tip of the sword.</p><br /><p>Chen Luo did not dare to move at this time, but just looked at Cai Tongchen in front of him, and the clear light flashed in Cai Tongchen's eyes, and his face showed doubt: "Huh? Soul is not abnormal?</p><br /><p>Feeling the tip of the sword on his throat retreat slightly, Chen Luo nodded: "Uncle Cai, it's really me."</p><br /><p>After a long minute, Cai Tongchen dissipated the blue light in his eyes, revealed a smile, and said apologetically: "It's the old man who is reckless, don't blame the virtuous nephew."</p><br /><p>just-</p><br /><p>"The virtuous nephew came back from the dead, presumably there must be another adventure, right?" After some tossing, Chen Luo sat on the middle hall of the back room, and Cai Tongchen continued to inquire without a trace.</p><br /><p>"I seem to have entered a peach blossom forest, and in the peach blossom forest there is an old man with a childlike appearance, and he said to me that you have not yet come here, why did you come at this time? Then he had to drink with me, and for some reason, with each sip of wine, my mind cleared a little. Until the jug of wine was all drunk, he said you should go, just waved my sleeves, I opened my eyes again, and I woke up..."</p><br /><p>In this world, Buddhism and Taoism are similar to the Buddhism and Taoism in previous lives, and many legends and legends related to Buddha and Tao have never appeared, such as the previous "Zhong Kui", and the Daomen of this world do not have this figure. But Confucianism is different!</p><br /><p>Well, pretending to be sharp-1-1-1-1...</p><br /><p>Forcer-10-10-10-10...</p><br /><p>So he pondered hard and finally made up such a pretense of "peach blossom fairy".</p><br /><p>"Peach Blossom Temple in Peach Blossom Dock, Peach Blossom Fairy in Peach Blossom Garden. Peach blossom fairy planted peach trees, and picked peach blossoms for wine money!</p><br /><p>Cai Tongchen nodded slightly, if he still had doubts about Chen Luo before, he didn't have the slightest doubt after listening to these four poems at this time. These four poetic sentences are still not exhausted, presumably there is a later part, but just these four sentences, showing the otherworldly quality, dashing state, not to say that Chen Luo has no talent for reading, even if Chen Luo's father is alive, it is difficult to say that he wrote such a poem, if it is not taught by a master, where did it come from?</p><br /><p>Looking at Cai Tongchen who was gradually in mood, Chen Luo breathed a sigh of relief in his heart, this Cai Tongchen should be the last level of his "resurrection from the dead", now it is over, silently thanked Tang Bohu of the Ming Dynasty in his heart, and then turned the topic to business.</p><br /><p>"The grass people pleaded with the lord to activate the official seal, covering Xixiu Mountain and locking the location of the tiger demon. In addition, send another group of servants, and follow me to Xixiu Mountain to eliminate demons..."</p><br /><p>Chen Luo quickly took out a wad of silver tickets from his arms, offered them with both hands, and said, "There are two thousand taels of silver tickets here, my Chen Mansion is grateful to the township, and I am willing to contribute to Wan'an, and I also ask the adults to accept it..."</p><br /><p>Chen Luo's heart sank slightly, and he gritted his teeth and said, "There are another thousand taels, which will be sent later!"</p><br /><p>Cai Tongchen didn't say much, took the tray, wrote a document on it, took out the private seal he carried with him, handed it to Master Li, and said: "That ghost is already a demon level, presumably the tiger demon has the lowest pure-blood realm, so he won't assign a servant, old Li, you work hard, go to Xixiu Mountain with Chen Luo." If the tiger demon is really hiding in the mountains, kill it on the spot!</p><br /><p>Chen Luo quickly got up and bowed: "Hard work Master Li!"</p><br /><p>The moon star is rare.</p><br /><p>In the carriage, Master Li held Cai Tongchen's county official seal in both hands, still looking like a grin, Chen Luo looked a little embarrassed, remembered Chen Xuan's order, and said: "Master Li, recently the family has received some antiques from the previous dynasty, and the family sister said that the master has unparalleled insight, and ask the master to help taste one or two another day..."</p><br /><p>Seeing that the atmosphere was warm, Chen Luo quickly continued to ask: "Forgive the little nephew for his shallow knowledge, before Uncle Cai said that the tiger demon is a pure-blood level, what realm is this, and I also asked Master Li to solve the confusion."</p><br /><p>"The cultivation of the demon race is different from that of my human race, they cultivate the way of the bloodline, and seek the bloodline to return to the ancestors."</p><br /><p>"The first realm is the Pure Blood Realm, and the demon race in this realm continues to fade the impurity bloodlines in the body, and the more clean it is, the higher the upper limit in the future. In the later stage of cultivation, it can be transformed into a human form, but some of the demon race's body cannot be hidden, such as tails, ears, limbs, etc., ordinary people can see at a glance that it is a demon race.</p><br /><p>"For example, the tiger demon who killed your Chen Mansion. Even if the ordinary tiger raises a ghost, that is, the wandering spirit level in the ghost, it is the lowest level. But to let the ghost advance to the level of a murderable evil ghost shows that the tiger demon has awakened the magic of 'soul manipulation'.</p><br /><p>Speaking of this, Master Li's smiling face showed a trace of disdain: "In the end, the demon clan is a group of guys who eat the ancestors' old roots, how can it be compared to my human clan to continue the past and forge ahead, and there are noble sons in the cold door..."</p><br /><p></p>

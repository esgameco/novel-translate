            <p>"What's the matter?" Chen Luo hurriedly asked.</p><br /><p>After speaking, Chen Ping glanced at Chen Luo with slanted eyes, and Chen Luoleng snorted, this kind of thing should not be taken seriously by the character of the previous body, so there is no memory.</p><br /><p>"You let the old slave look at it..." Chen Ping continued, "The old slave made a good idea, found Zhou Yong, a hunter from Xiaoxi Village, gave him twenty taels of silver, and sent a dozen Zhuangding as helpers, ran to Xixiu Mountain to catch the tiger, and killed it.</p><br /><p>"At that time, Zhou Yong probed the tiger's den, saying that there should be two tigers nearby, a male and a female, how did they kill the head mother, but they did not see the public. Just in case, I asked people to search the vicinity for a few more days, but when they couldn't find the male tiger, they withdrew the man. Young Master, do you say that the male tiger has cultivated into essence and returned for revenge?</p><br /><p>"Is Zhou Yongke still there?" Chen Luo asked.</p><br /><p>Chen Luo frowned again and drank lightly: "Zhong Kui!"</p><br /><p>Chen Luo did not pay attention to Chen Ping's expression, but asked Zhong Kui: "You eat that ghost, but what did you find?"</p><br /><p>"So that ghost eight achievements were transformed by Zhou Yong..." Chen Luo muttered, "Then the tiger demon that harmed my Chen Mansion should be the male tiger that disappeared."</p><br /><p>Chen Luo thought for a moment and said, "That tiger demon has killed so many people, and his body must be full of blood and qi, and he does not dare to approach the county town. Since it was originally a fierce beast of Xixiu Mountain, it must also be hiding in Xixiu Mountain.</p><br /><p>"Uncle Ping, you go to the account and pay two thousand taels of silver!"</p><br /><p>"Young Master, do you want to ask the young lady?" Chen Ping hesitated for a moment, but still said tentatively.</p><br /><p>Of course, the county magistrate took this silver, and then used it to build bridges and pave roads, support widows and orphans, and subsidize official education, but made the dynasty's luck stronger.</p><br /><p>Chen Ping was shocked when he heard this, and saw Zhong Kui behind Chen Luo looking at him with a grin, and quickly waved his hand: "The old slave never meant this, I... I'll go to the account and withdraw the silver ticket.</p><br /><p>Chen Ping quickly answered and turned to leave. Chen Luo then turned his head to look at Zhong Kui, when Zhong Kui appeared before, as the Lord of the Book Spirit, he sensed the weakening of the aura on Zhong Kui's body.</p><br /><p>Zhong Kui was stunned, and waved at Chen Luo: "Annoying the Lord Gong cares, a certain family has nothing to do." It's just that the underworld here is a little strange, and when the lord settles the matter of the tiger demon, it is not too late for a certain family to make a reward.</p><br /><p>Coming out of the gate of Chenfufu is Xi'an Avenue, one of the three main streets of Wan'an County, which is full of the houses of rich families and powerful people in the county, mixed with some schools and medical halls. At this time, it was the third change, there were no pedestrians on the road, Chen Ping drove out a carriage from the house, Chen Luo stepped on the car, got into the carriage, and then rushed by Chen Ping, and began to ponder in his heart how to face the number one person in the county - Cai Tongchen of Cai Zhi County!</p><br /><p>But at this time, Chen Luo was not allowed to choose, according to Zhong Kui, the tiger demon needed the ghost to return to understand what the ghost did, so the tiger demon did not know that the ghost was eaten by Zhong Kui for the time being. However, if the ghost does not return to the tiger demon after dawn, the tiger demon must know that something happened to the ghost, and things will be difficult to predict.</p><br /><p>The moon star is rare, the county office is not far from Chen Mansion, about twenty minutes away, Chen Ping drove the carriage behind the county office. This county official residence is behind the Yamen, and naturally there is also a grand main gate behind the county office. Chen Ping stepped forward and knocked on the door, and in less than a moment the door opened the door with a sleepy eye, and before he spoke, he saw a piece of snowflake silver handed over, quickly swallowed the scolding, smiled and took the silver with his left hand, took the post with his right hand, said "wait first", and closed the door.</p><br /><p>What Chen Luo didn't expect was that Master Li didn't wait, but waited for a sharp qi machine to shoot out from the rear and hit Chen Luo's carriage, and the entire carriage suddenly fell apart. Chen Luo only saw a middle-aged scribe with a straight appearance flying out of the back in a long robe, holding a long sword, pointing at himself, and shouting——</p>

        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Xiao Luo, you go back to your room and rest well, help me call Xiao Huan by the way, I will go to the county with her, and the government will not care about this demon matter." Chen Xuan grabbed Chen Luo's hand and spoke.</p><br /><p>"Sister, let me go, you have also worked hard for a day." Chen Luo replied. Chen Xuan's eyes were blind, even if Xiao Huan followed, Chen Luo was a little uneasy.</p><br /><p>Chen Xuan was talking when she only heard an exclamation: "Miss, your eyes... Are your eyes blind?</p><br /><p>Chen Luo only felt that Chen Xuan's hand that grabbed him tightened a little!</p><br /><p>"It's really inconvenient for me to come forward. In this way, Xiao Huan, you go and call Uncle Ping, and let Uncle Ping go to the official mansion with Xiao Luo. Chen Xuan ordered while dismissing the crying ring. As for Chen Luo's failure to expose her before, she didn't mention it.</p><br /><p>"That's it." Chen Xuan quickly set the tone of the matter, and instructed, "Xiao Luo, the best tea tasting in Cai Zhi County, there is a cake of 'purple gentian' in Tanzhou in the study, you will bring it when you go to the county." In addition, you must remember that the county court is Master Li's nephew, so you can't be slow or too polite, just let Uncle Ping reward a silver or two. The person who came out to lead the way was Master Li himself, and you said that there were antiques from the former dynasty and asked him to appreciate them another day. When I turn back, I will arrange for someone to send that 'Jianhu Pen' to his outer house..."</p><br /><p>Chen Luo carefully wrote down Chen Xuan's explanation, and helped Chen Xuan all the way back to the boudoir, when Xiao Huan ran and said that Uncle Ping was already waiting in the study. Chen Luo then retreated, instructed Xiaohuan to take care of Chen Xuan, turned to leave, and walked towards the study.</p><br /><p>"Change? No fat or thin, no tall or short, no black or white... Nothing has changed! Xiao Huan replied while making the bed.</p><br /><p>"I see that young lady, you have no heart or lungs, your eyes are blind, and you are still thinking about Young Master Luo's affairs." Xiao Huan pouted and looked at Chen Xuan with some grievances. Xiaohuan has grown up with Chen Xuan since childhood, and she is like a sister, and there are only two people in the room at this time, so there is naturally less taboo when talking.</p><br /><p>She already knew the result from the time Chen Xuan inserted the first silver needle into the acupuncture tunnel, but she still did it. Although he did not directly kill the ghost, he also dragged it until "Zhong Kui" appeared and finally eliminated the ghost, so there was not much frustration at this time.</p><br /><p>At the same time that Chen Xuan was self-attacking, Chen Luo was taking another identity test in his study.</p><br /><p>"Six years old. But I didn't interrupt it, you broke it when you carried me to climb the Bowang Tower to protect me..."</p><br /><p>"It was my father's transcription of "Spring and Autumn", but I couldn't read it, and I tore it up in anger. You lied to your daddy that it was a dog bite..."</p><br /><p>"Shit, your good friend is our cook Aunt Ma. When I was a child, I loved to eat the sugar cakes made by Aunt Ma, and you invited Aunt Ma to be a cook in the house under false pretenses. Fifteen or six years have passed, and you haven't gotten into Aunt Ma's bed, I look down on you!</p><br /><p>This old man was naturally Chen Ping, the housekeeper of the Chen Mansion, and Chen Luo had long heard from this hoarse voice that the person who poured black dog blood on himself and let people nail themselves with a coffin was him. However, at this time, watching the old man cry quickly, he couldn't catch his breath, and he had to calm down first, so as not to add to the white matter of Chen Mansion.</p><br /><p>"Uncle Ping, wait a minute!" Chen Luo called out to Chen Ping and said, "Just went to the official mansion like this, and we didn't know anything about it, but it was just a waste of time." It's best if we study it first, and have a breakthrough.</p><br /><p>Chen Pingleng paused for a moment, tried to recall in his mind, and said: "My Chen family cultivates the heirloom, where will I offend any monsters?" The old man liked to travel around when he was alive, but he had other identities besides the demon exterminator and would not be implicated in the family. This tiger demon..."</p>

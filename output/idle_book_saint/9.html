        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Do you have a way?" Master Li looked at Chen Luo unexpectedly, he knew that Chen Luo was the son of Cai Zhixian's old friend, so he took care of him all the way, but he never expected him to help him.</p><br /><p>Zhong Kui slowly appeared behind Chen Luo, Master Li was worthy of being a person who had seen strong winds and waves, and he was not surprised by Zhong Kui's hideous face, but just like Cai Tongchen, his eyes flashed blue, and then asked: "This is a book spirit?"</p><br /><p>Master Li hurriedly returned the salute: "Please do your best."</p><br /><p>Zhong Kui closed his eyes slightly, suddenly opened his eyes, turned to look at Chen Luo, and said: "Lord, this demon soul is a foreign soul, and the aura is still complete, but you need to bother the Lord to check it yourself."</p><br /><p>Zhong Kui shook his head slightly: "I am the lord's book spirit, and the soul is connected, so that I can transfer the soul, but I can't move into Li Wenyou's soul." Moreover, with my protection, the Lord is safe.</p><br /><p>I saw that the iron chain in Zhong Kui's hand kept retracting, and finally a golden fist-sized light was hooked, and Zhong Kui's eyes were quick, and he shot directly into Chen Luo's seal hall. Chen Luo's brain seemed to have been shocked, his eyes were black, and he suddenly fell to the ground, fortunately, Chen Ping had been standing beside Chen Luo and held Chen Luo up.</p><br /><p>Zhong Kui stepped forward and pointed at Chen Luo's forehead, sensed it for a moment, and said: "It's okay, the Lord is checking the memory of the tiger demon, and you can wake up later!"</p><br /><p>Soon, Chen Luo saw his target, which was a baby tiger that had just been born. Unlike others of its kind, this little tiger awakens wisdom from the moment it is born. It can read hunters' traps and store food reasonably to ensure there is no risk of starvation.</p><br /><p>It cares for Ah Jump like a pet, and it tries its best to make Ah Jump as smart as itself, but to no avail.</p><br /><p>Ah Yu still felt sorry for it and returned to its side. It finally didn't control itself and mated with Ah Jump...</p><br /><p>Strictly speaking, it was not a person, and a white tiger's tail fell behind that person.</p><br /><p>It agreed without thinking, and it intuitively felt the strength of the other party. If you go with him, you will become stronger. At that time, he can justifiably regard Ah Jump as his own forbidden.</p><br /><p>It cultivates very quickly, one year of pure blood, two years of pure blood, this is only two years and six months, it has reached the level of blood refining, and has turned the talent demon art "wind control" into a blood pattern magical power.</p><br /><p>Wind Liancheng once warned it that if it opened its spiritual intelligence, it had nothing to do with the beast. The beast, that is the meat on the table, the life is like grass and mustard, and the monster is a heavenly creature that stands side by side with man and barbarian, and cannot be mixed with food.</p><br /><p>It has been waiting for an opportunity to return to Daxuan and bring Ah Jump back to the Winged Tiger clan.</p><br /><p>The Winged Tiger Lineage wants to take a strange treasure from Daxuan, and needs a clan member to go to Daxuan to receive it. It was chosen because of its low cultivation and the fact that it was born in Daxuan, and it was chosen to take some measures to cross the sea and enter the territory of the Daxuan Dynasty.</p><br /><p>It's just five hundred miles!</p><br /><p>It wants to take revenge, but after all, it has been practicing for less than three years, and only the cultivation of the beginner blood refining is not enough to overthrow a city; It wanted to assassinate, but because it had been in contact with that exotic treasure for too long, it also carried a trace of heavenly punishment, and it would be discovered by the Terrans as soon as it entered the county. Therefore, he chose to make a ghost, and the person he chose was Zhou Yong, the hunter who took the lead in hunting down A Jump...</p><br /><p>"Young Master, you are finally awake... You scared the old slave to death..."</p><br /><p>"Oh? I also asked the Chen family master to come..." Master Li was overjoyed and hurriedly urged.</p><br /><p>"Fetch treasures in my Daxuan?" Master Li was shocked, "Please elaborate!"</p><br /><p>Master Li nodded: "That's just right." Pleaseâ€”"</p>

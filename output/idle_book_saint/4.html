        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Are you Zhong Kui?" Chen Luo circled around Zhong Kui several times, God, this is a god, he wrote an article and summoned it...</p><br /><p>"Shuling?" Chen Luo frowned slightly, "Can you catch ghosts?"</p><br /><p>"But what?"</p><br /><p>Chen Luo nodded: "Are you two realms higher?"</p><br /><p>Just as Chen Luo and Zhong Kui were asking and answering, there was a sudden exclamation outside the house, and almost at the same time, Zhong Kui's nose shrugged and said in a deep voice: "There is ghost qi!"</p><br /><p>Because of the relationship between the dead people in the Chen Mansion, Chen Xuan dismissed many family members, and the huge Chen Mansion was slightly empty. Chen Luo ran out of the backyard and saw the little maid who had called for his corpse earlier fall to the edge of the garden, with a thin quilt scattered around his hand. This maid's name is Xiaohuan, and she is Chen Xuan's personal maid.</p><br /><p>Xiao Huan saw that it was Chen Luo, and quickly panicked: "We saw the ghost, and the young lady chased it out... Miss, she..."</p><br /><p>Chen Luo looked back at Zhong Kui, who smiled a little embarrassed, this smile looked particularly creepy against the background of the moonlight. Chen Luo probed Xiao Huan's snort, and found that he just fainted, so he put the thin quilt on Xiao Huan's body and asked Zhong Kui: "Can you sense it?"</p><br /><p>Chen Xuan had a practice, which Chen Luo knew. However, it is not the authentic sect of the three religions, it is the side door of some wild fox Zen, called "Thirteen Needles of Heavenly Gate", which is not the acupuncture technique of the medical path, but a set of killing techniques that defeat the enemy with silver needles. Dealing with ordinary people is naturally not a problem, but dealing with ghosts is a bit outrageous.</p><br /><p>"Are you all right? What the hell are you chasing, in case there is a good villain..." Chen Luo said while approaching Chen Xuan, and suddenly Chen Luo's footsteps stopped, and his whole face was distorted.</p><br /><p>"Silver Needle Crossing Soul!" Chen Luo squeezed out a few words from between his teeth, and he, who had already absorbed the memories of his predecessor, certainly knew what was in front of him.</p><br /><p>Chen Luo looked back at Zhong Kui, Zhong Kui waved his sleeves, and a cold breath shot into Chen Luo's eyes, Chen Luo's eyes were cold, and he returned to normal after blinking again. Then he raised his head with Zhong Kui, and saw that on the roof of the main hall, Chen Xuan's soul was fighting with a ghost creature with green face and fangs and long hands and feet.</p><br /><p>Zhong Kui's appearance startled both Chen Xuan and the ghost, and Chen Xuan saw Chen Luo standing below, his face showed anxiety, and shouted: "Xiao Luo, go back quickly!" Chen Luo shouted, "Chen Xuan, hurry up and return to your place!"</p><br /><p>When the ghost saw Zhong Kui, it opened its mouth and roared, and a ghost voice struck. Zhong Kui didn't care at all, just looked at the ghost, swallowed a mouthful of saliva, unconsciously stuck out his tongue, and licked his lips.</p><br /><p>Zhong Kui swallowed the ghost's eyes and chewed it in his mouth. At the same time, he reached out again, grabbed the ghost's arm, twisted and pulled in the opposite direction, and actually ripped off the ghost's arm, and the ghost tried to struggle, but was stepped on by Zhong Kui on the back, lying on the ground and unable to move.</p><br /><p>Chen Xuanlen, who witnessed Zhong Kui's dry rice, was stunned for a moment, until Chen Luo called out to her again, she came back to her senses, floated to the ground, and looked back at Zhong Kui, who was still eating heavily, with some heart palpitations, and asked, "Who is that?"</p><br /><p>Chen Xuan did not immediately return the soul to its place, but looked at Chen Luo carefully with some attachment: "I'll take a look at you again, in case I can't see it later..."</p><br /><p>"Rhinitis? What is that?</p><br /><p>Chen Xuan nodded, walked to his physical body, and instantly merged with his physical body, and opened his eyes.</p><br /><p>Chen Xuan sensed it, UU read a book www.uukanshu.com smiled: "You are right, the sense of smell is gone..."</p><br /><p>Chen Xuan shook her head slightly: "I'm afraid it will harm you again..."</p><br /><p>I don't know why, counting this time, the woman in front of him, Chen Luo, only saw the second time, but at this time, Chen Luo's heart was like a fire, his nose was sour, and his eyes were instantly moist.</p><br /><p>"His name is Zhong Kui, he is..." Chen Luo suppressed the emotions that were churning in his heart and continued: "The book spirit I summoned!</p><br /><p>Before Chen Luo could answer, Zhong Kui had already swallowed the entire ghost into his belly, floated down from the roof, and threw his hand at Chen Luo: "Master, a certain family has subdued the ghost thing." But...... This ghost is not really behind it!</p><br /><p>Zhong Kui threw his hand over again: "This ghost is not an ordinary ghost, but a ghost!" The ghost, the tiger eats people. The ghost can't control himself, he can only do what the tiger orders ... Therefore, what is really murdering the lord's family is the tiger demon behind this ghost! ‚Äù</p><br /><p></p>

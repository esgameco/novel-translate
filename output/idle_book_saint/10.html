        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Master Li, there is something I want to ask you for." Walking on the rugged mountain road, Chen Luo found a topic to divert his thoughts in order not to think back to the past of the tiger demon.</p><br /><p>"Before I saw your fighting method with the tiger demon, why can just one word have the effect of an entire war poem?" Speaking of this, Chen Luo remembered the heroic scene of Master Li saying a word and a golden knife.</p><br /><p>"I want to hear about it."</p><br /><p>"This first realm is called the 'self-seeing realm', the so-called 'read a book a hundred times, its righteousness is self-seeing', which means that if you really read through a Confucian classic, you can give birth to 'Haoran righteousness' in your body."</p><br /><p>"The second realm is called the 'Falling Pen Realm', which can guide Haoran righteous qi to leave the body by writing Yawen, which is also the root of war poetry. Therefore, the Confucians who arrived at this realm acquired the ability to attack through the practice of battle poetry.</p><br /><p>"Of course, there is no shortage of geniuses in the world, some people have just entered the pen realm, and they can create their own Yawen poems with their pen, breaking the two realms in a row, so some people call these two realms together, praising 'the pen falls into a storm, and the poem becomes a weeping ghost'."</p><br /><p>Chen Luo secretly remembered in his heart that the demon race has "pure blood", "pure blood", and "refining blood"; Confucianism has "self-seeing", "falling pen", and "becoming poetry"; These are all basic cultivation paths, and I don't know what is the difference between that gate and the Buddha gate, and what kind of cultivation system is the northern barbarian tribe that has always been rumored to be the mortal enemy of the Terran race?</p><br /><p>I don't know if in that sea of dream flowers, those miscellaneous books that do not exist in this world but are as vast as the sea, can help me open a different path of cultivation?</p><br /><p>retracted his divergent thoughts, Chen Luo continued to take Master Li to trek forward in the Xixiu Mountains, maybe it was the previous Qi Luck Probe, or maybe Master Li killed the tiger demon with great might, and there was not a single beast interfering along the way.</p><br /><p>As this chant fell, I saw a small ball of light slowly emerging behind Master Li's head, illuminating the scene of ten steps around.</p><br /><p>Chen Luo scanned a circle of caves, and finally came to a chaotic stone area, moved the chaotic stones one by one, and took out the dagger he carried with him and dug for a while, and finally saw a dark secret box. Chen Luo took out the secret box and handed it to Master Li: "This is it."</p><br /><p>In an instant, a cyan light that was more magnificent than the Haoran righteousness on Master Li's body instantly illuminated the entire cave, and the chanting of scriptures could be faintly heard in this blue light.</p><br /><p>"Master Li!" Chen Luo shouted, and Master Li looked back at Chen Luo, and Chen Luo was startled, because he found a fierce killing intent in Master Li's eyes. After a few seconds, Master Li suddenly took a deep breath, stabilized his emotions, and closed the secret box. As the lid of the box closed, the sky-piercing blue light was also locked in the secret box...</p><br /><p>Chen Luo nodded, and was about to answer, then Master Li directly stepped forward and grabbed Chen Luo's arm, chanting in his mouth, "A little Haoran qi, a thousand miles of fast wind"! Chen Luo only felt that he was stepping on a soft cloud, and the oncoming wind blew pain on his face, blowing so that he couldn't open his eyes. It wasn't until he felt this feeling disappear that he found that he was already standing outside Xixiu Mountain, Chen Ping was standing in front of him, and Master Li was nowhere to be seen.</p><br /><p>"Immortal Wenxin, that's a good thing!" While rushing to the car, Chen Ping said to Chen Luo, "The old man mentioned to me that the one who can condense that thing must be the Great Confucian Realm. Further up the Great Confucian Realm, he is a saint.</p><br /><p>"Liyan, meritorious service, and morality, the master said that this is called the three immortals!"</p><br /><p>"How? That exotic treasure received by the tiger demon is an immortal heart?</p><br /><p>When Chen Ping heard this, he waved his whip again: "The bold demon race, that is the most precious treasure of our human race. No wonder that tiger demon only had a little contact time and was contaminated with the power of the Terran Heavenly Punishment.</p><br /><p>Chen Luo thought about it, he just happened to find the immortal heart, and the big guys involved in the three immortal realms of Confucianism should not worry about it themselves. With this thought, it's better to think about your cultivation and Chen Xuan's eyes...</p><br /><p>"But no, the land outside the city has not yet been turned over, and it has to move, otherwise it will miss the day and the harvest will be poor."</p><br /><p>"Young Master, your brain is confused. You are alone, and you usually live in a small ring.</p><br /><p>"Young Master, let's ask the young lady about this."</p><br /><p>"That... Young Master, this Lord, really can't do it..."</p><br /><p>Master Li said angrily: "Sir, the immortal Wen Xin is the result of the great Confucian's life's painstaking efforts, and it is unbearable that someone traded it to the demon clan, and it must be reported to the imperial court and strictly investigated to the end!"</p><br /><p>Master Li thought of something, and his face changed: "You mean..."</p><br /><p></p>

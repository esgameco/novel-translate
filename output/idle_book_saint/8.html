        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Lifting the curtain, Master Li and Chen Luo walked out of the carriage, and a green mountain came into view.</p><br /><p>"Patriarch Chen, let me ask again, are you sure you want to explore this Xixiu Mountain? My family proprietor said, even if you take out another three thousand taels of silver and want to use your luck a second time, it will have to wait until after January..."</p><br /><p>Master Li put away the smiling expression on his face at this time, and his face became solemn. He took out the authorization order written by Cai Tongchen earlier from his sleeve and pasted it on the official seal. I saw that the paper book burned rapidly, but there was no ash scattered, and in an instant, the paper book burned out, and a faint green light appeared on the official seal of Qipinzhi County, and on the official seal itself, you can vaguely see a public opinion map of Wan'an County.</p><br /><p>Almost at the same time, there was a burst of beast roaring eagle roar in Xixiu Mountain, and Master Li was not impressed, but explained to Chen Luo: "Qi luck is like clear water, under clear water, any impurities will be clear at a glance..."</p><br /><p>At this moment, another ray of light rose up in the Xixiu Mountain, the pillar of light was red, mixed with a hint of black, more than twice as thick as the previous three white pillars of light.</p><br /><p>Chen Luo also stared at the pillar of light at this time, only to see a phantom shadow in the pillar of light distorted, gradually becoming clear, it was a tiger with a blood basin and a big mouth.</p><br /><p>Master Li nodded slightly: "This beast knows that he is locked by qi luck, and he actually doesn't hide or hide, and comes directly towards us..." After speaking, he handed the official seal to Chen Luo, "You hold the official seal, you can be protected by qi luck!" Just watch the battle from the sidelines, and don't enter the battle circle.</p><br /><p>Master Li's kind and kind appearance at this time has disappeared, replaced by a solemn appearance that is not angry and self-threatening. He was covered in a thin layer of blue light, which made people feel awe-inspiring.</p><br /><p>Master Li smiled boldly at this time, took a step, and the whole person faced the colorful tiger that pounced, only listening to Master Li rushing all the way, singing all the way:</p><br /><p>The Seven Cities looked at Chixia Pass.</p><br /><p>If you don't break the gold account, you won't pay it back.</p><br /><p>After the collision between Master Li and the Tiger, they each retreated tens of meters, and rushed towards each other again.</p><br /><p>Chen Luo was still thinking, the blood pattern on the colorful tiger suddenly flashed a light, Chen Luo vaguely saw that the space above the tiger was distorted, and the fallen leaves fluttered, as if a tiger claw composed of wind, towards Master Li.</p><br /><p>"Uncle Ping, can Master Li win?" Chen Luo was also slightly nervous at this time, and before Chen Ping could answer, he only listened to Master Li spit out a word -</p><br /><p>As soon as the word came out, the golden light above Master Li's head burst out, and a golden knife quickly condensed and cut down towards the wind gathering tiger claw.</p><br /><p>Gelding new cross white jade saddle,</p><br /><p>The iron drum of the city head is still shaking,</p><br /><p>The golden light streaked across the night sky like a thunderbolt, only listening to a wail, the tiger's claws shattered instantly, and even the colorful tiger also whimpered, rolled on the ground a few times, and when it got up again, from the back of the neck to the abdomen, a bloody wound appeared. The tiger looked at Master Li, and then at Chen Luo not far away, and with a cross in his heart, he turned the tiger's head and rushed straight at Chen Luo. And at that moment, the speed seemed to increase again, and in the blink of an eye, he was less than 100 meters away from Chen Luo.</p><br /><p>Chen Luo slowly approached the fallen tiger demon, but did not dare to get too close, only stood ten meters away, holding the official seal in one hand, looked at the tiger demon, and asked: "I ask you, did you send a ghost to kill more than twenty people in my Chen Mansion?"</p><br /><p>"A good wicked man first... No, the evil tiger sued first. Obviously, your wife kidnapped my tenants first..."</p><br /><p>"What's more, this is a demon!" Master Li walked to the tiger demon's side, stretched out a foot, and stepped on the tiger demon's neck, "Say, what force did you send me Daxuan?" Buddha Gate? Ten Thousand Demon Kingdom? Or barbarians?</p><br /><p>Chen Luo also stepped forward a few steps, glanced at the tiger demon, looked at Master Li, and asked, "Master Li, what is the evil demon?"</p><br /><p>The tiger demon sneered: "Of the ten holy kings of the Ten Thousand Demon Kingdom, at least four are haunted by the power of the Terran Race's heavenly punishment. Do you Da Xuan dare to break through ten thousand demons and kill the Holy Monarch? It is not still a policy of making peace and sending the noble daughter of the sect to marry the kings of the Ten Thousand Demon Kingdom.</p><br /><p>The tiger demon no longer answered, just closed his eyes indifferently, but in a moment, Chen Luo found that the tiger demon's originally majestic body was slightly shriveled. Master Li realized that something was wrong, reached out and probed it, only to find that this tiger demon had launched the self-extinguishing technique of "bloodline exhaustion" at some point, and it had lost its vitality.</p><br /><p>At this moment, Zhong Kui's voice suddenly sounded in Chen Luo's head: "Master, this tiger demon's soul is a little strange, maybe a certain family can probe some information..."</p>

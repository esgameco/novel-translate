            <p>Chen Luo opened his eyes again and felt a dizziness, which was obviously a sequel of being beaten before. Chen Luo slowed down for a while before looking around.</p><br /><p>turned his head sideways and saw Chen Xuan lying on the table in the room and falling asleep. Chen Luo looked at Chen Xuan carefully, in the memory of his predecessor, Chen Xuan was a woman with sharp means, and she was not bad for herself, but she didn't dare to get too close.</p><br /><p>Sure enough, in the eyes of his younger brother, no matter how beautiful his sister is, she is like a flower.</p><br /><p>Chen Luo sighed secretly in his heart, did not alarm the sleeping Chen Xuan, but sorted out his thoughts...</p><br /><p>is the book "The Biography of Zhong Kui"!</p><br /><p>At this point, it is necessary to revisit the memory of the predecessor.</p><br /><p>It is said that the writing of this world was once projected from the Heavenly Dao, and such writing was called "Yawen", and reading the classics copied by Yawen can gain extraordinary power from it.</p><br /><p>Thus, the three heavenly paths of Confucianism, Taoism and Buddha were created.</p><br /><p>But!</p><br /><p>There is no pear garden opera in this world, and the book book is commentary.</p><br /><p>There is no Tang Zhi Weird Legend, no Ming and Qing Dynasty novels;</p><br /><p>No Pu Songling, no Wu Chengen;</p><br /><p>In this sense, it's a cultural desert.</p><br /><p>True Extracurricular Books!</p><br /><p>"Xiao Luo!" When Chen Xuan saw Chen Luo awake, he immediately pounced and hugged Chen Luo tightly, "You are finally awake." Does your head still hurt? Hungry or not? Or do you want to drink water?</p><br /><p>"Also... It's okay...," Chen Luo replied stiffly.</p><br /><p>Chen Xuan turned his head and frowned: "What's wrong?"</p><br /><p>Chen Xuan put his hand on Chen Luo's pulse again, sensing that Chen Luo's pulse had indeed returned to normal, only then nodded, glanced at the quilt, and said: "Your room did a magic before, and now it is unlucky to live in it." I'll ask Xiaohuan to change you into a thinner quilt.</p><br /><p>Seeing Chen Xuan leave, Chen Luochang let out a long breath, to be honest, how to get along with this beautiful sister in the future, he still has to do a little psychological construction.</p><br /><p>At this time, only Chen Luo was left in the room, Chen Luo got down from the bed, put on his shoes at random and walked to the desk, spread out the paper, dipped the pen in ink, and began to write "Zhong Kui's Brief Biography", thanks to the memory of the predecessor, Yawen Chen Luo has also fully mastered, and the brush writing in one hand is also at the middle and upper level.</p><br /><p>"This is ... The power of the Heavenly Dao? Chen Luo was confused again, he once mentioned in his previous memory that if you want to write books and make articles in this world, you must conform to the true meaning of Heaven's Dao, which is also the fundamental reason why reading can gain strength. If it is not recognized by the Heavenly Dao, it is impossible for UU to read books www.uukanshu.com successfully. It is precisely because of this that the only books written in this world using "Yawen" are the classics of the Three Teachings.</p><br /><p>At this moment, Chen Luo seemed to see the "Legend of Zhong Kui" presented in the sea of dream flowers on the white paper under his pen, and this illusion passed away in a flash, but almost at the same time, Chen Luo also sensed that the power of the Heavenly Dao added to him also disappeared at the same time.</p><br /><p>Thinking of this, Chen Luo did not delay and immediately began to write "The Biography of Zhong Kui".</p><br /><p>"Zhong Kui, a native of Shaanxi Province, was talented when he was young... Therefore, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang ordered Wu Daozi to make a picture of Zhong Kui's ghost hunting scene in his dream and hang it in the palace to ward off evil spirits.</p><br /><p>The ugly man was nearly two meters tall, with a leopard head and eyes, an iron face, a hideous face, a red imperial uniform, and a top-hat.

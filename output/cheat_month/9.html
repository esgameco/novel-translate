        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 9: People Are More Poisonous Than Ghosts</p><p></p><p>The mansion was grand, and the guards were spirited.</p><p></p><p>The two characters "Huang Mansion" were engraved on a plaque.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing, held by four big men, walked into the Huang Mansion. Huang Shiren had been waiting for a while.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhou, we meet again."</p><p></p><p>Huang Shiren's face was somewhat square, with a small mustache. He wore a long robe, unlike the common long hair of this era, but very short and sparse.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that your place has been haunted these past few days. Are you alright? I heard you even went to Taibai Martial Arts School to learn martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>"Learning martial arts at the age of twenty-two, you have ambition. I admire you!"</p><p></p><p>"Thanks to Master Huang's blessing, the past few days have been quite good." Zhou Qing looked at Huang Shiren, thinking this person really doesn't look like a good man.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that you're doing well." Huang Shiren held his teacup, gently blowing on it, and took a light sip.</p><p></p><p>"The reason I invited Brother Zhou here this time, I believe you are clear about it."</p><p></p><p>Huang Shiren put down the cup and stared at Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>"That house of yours, I have been waiting for it for a long time. I wonder if Brother Zhou has come around these past few days?"</p><p></p><p>"If Brother Zhou hasn't come around yet, I can also help, to make you come around."</p><p></p><p>"After all, a haunting is no small matter. It might just keep getting worse."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Huang Shiren's threat, Zhou Qing felt angry.</p><p></p><p>That ghost was indeed inextricably linked to Huang Shiren.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had already destroyed one ghost, Huang Shiren probably still had other means.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing could roughly guess that the ghost that attacked him was probably not a powerful figure among ghosts, likely just a minor one.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhou Qing not speaking, Huang Shiren frowned slightly, "Brother Zhou, although the house is good, one needs to be alive to live in it."</p><p></p><p>"Your life isn't tough enough, you can't hold onto it."</p><p></p><p>"I am now a disciple of Taibai Martial Arts School," Zhou Qing said.</p><p></p><p>"A disciple of Taibai Martial Arts School? There are plenty of those in Heiyun Town!" Huang Shiren said leisurely:</p><p></p><p>"If you don't go to the martial arts school tomorrow, who will care."</p><p></p><p>"A few days later when your corpse is discovered at home, the authorities will open a case for you."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhou, as a person, you need to be a bit smarter. You want to deal with me by practicing martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if I give you four more months, you still won't be able to do it."</p><p></p><p>"No background, no power, you..."</p><p></p><p>Before Huang Shiren could finish, suddenly a woman came running in from outside, crying.</p><p></p><p>"Master Huang, I beg you, let me go back. My father passed early, and there's only my mother at home. I still need to take care of my mother. Please let me go back."</p><p></p><p>And because of this woman's pulling, a few drops of tea spilled from Huang Shiren's hand.</p><p></p><p>A few servants appeared at the door, looking anxious. Seeing Huang Shiren, they kept kowtowing, saying they were negligent in their duties and failed to watch over the woman, begging Huang Shiren to spare their lives.</p><p></p><p>Huang Shiren waved his hand and said, "It's alright, you may go. Mr. Zhang, you all go too. Let me handle things here, close the door."</p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhang and the others were the few big men who brought Zhou Qing here.</p><p></p><p>After they left, only Zhou Qing, Huang Shiren and that woman remained.</p><p></p><p>"Stand up and speak." Huang Shiren pulled the woman up.</p><p></p><p>"You've been here for five days, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master Huang, please be kind and let me go." The woman begged pitifully, her eyes red and swollen.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect Master Huang to forcibly abduct women." Zhou Qing mocked.</p><p></p><p>This surnamed Huang is truly capable of all evil.</p><p></p><p>"What forcible abduction, I'm just giving them a better place to belong."</p><p></p><p>Huang Shiren didn't look at Zhou Qing, but said to the woman:</p><p></p><p>"You say you need to take care of your mother... I remember, your mother lives in a small village east outside the town, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Let me tell you a piece of good news."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Huang Shiren revealed a smile, exposing his yellow teeth...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry about your mother being left unattended after you leave, because on the day I brought you back..."</p><p></p><p>"I also sent your mother away. It's been several days, and I'm afraid the corpse has already been gnawed clean by wild dogs. Tsk tsk tsk, how tragic."</p><p></p><p>"But if you set off now, you might still be able to accompany your mother."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the woman let out a scream and suddenly stopped crying. She stood motionless as if she had become an idiot.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's fists clenched tightly as he quickly stepped forward and pulled the woman behind him to protect her, fearing that she might act impulsively and that Huang Shiren might attack her.</p><p></p><p>"Huang, you are worse than a beast, you scum!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing felt that even the ghost he encountered last night was not as vicious as the "person" in front of him!</p><p></p><p>"I was going to tease you a bit more and kill you after you agreed to hand over the house to me." Huang Shiren shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Young people are just too impetuous."</p><p></p><p>Huang Shiren suddenly took out a tattered small flag from under the table, waved his large hand, and muttered as if chanting a spell.</p><p></p><p>"Hoo!"</p><p></p><p>A black wind appeared out of nowhere, and two ghostly figures appeared in the room, accompanied by the piercing sound of ghostly wails.</p><p></p><p>"You made me lose a ghost slave, so you won't die easily."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing stared at the tattered small flag in Huang Shiren's hand, wondering if it was also a magic weapon.</p><p></p><p>The other two ghost slaves summoned by Huang Shiren howled and charged at Zhou Qing, impacting his soul.</p><p></p><p>However, the iridescent liquid in the Sea of Consciousness glowed faintly, and such an impact dissipated into nothingness without affecting Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>The illusory power of these two ghost slaves was also directly seen through by Zhou Qing, failing to trap him in a state of delusion.</p><p></p><p>But Zhou Qing clearly felt that the ghosts he was facing now had a stronger aura than the one from last night.</p><p></p><p>"Your will is indeed firm, no wonder you were able to endure under my ghost slave for six days." Huang Shiren sat steadily like Mount Tai and sneered:</p><p></p><p>"You were lucky last night to have an expert passing by who saved you, but who can save you this time?"</p><p></p><p>Huang Shiren thought of what happened last night. After discovering that his ghost slave had been destroyed, he immediately sent someone to investigate the situation.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the servant came back and reported that they did not find anything unusual and only saw an old man and a young man leaving Zhou Qing's house.</p><p></p><p>Today, after collecting some information about the old and young man, Huang Shiren deduced the "truth" of what happened last night.</p><p></p><p>So when Zhou Qing left the martial arts school, he decided to take action immediately to avoid any further complications.</p><p></p><p>However, Huang Shiren initially did not intend to kill Zhou Qing in his own house, but who let Zhou Qing see what he shouldn't have seen.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing ignored Huang Shiren and focused on dealing with the two ghosts.</p><p></p><p>The master had told him during the day that when facing ghosts, there was no need to panic. The vigorous qi and blood of a warrior were most effective in suppressing these dark and evil beings!</p><p></p><p>So as long as one became a warrior, one could harm ghosts. In the early stages of cultivation, warriors had the advantage.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the prerequisite was that the ghost you were facing could not be too powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing threw a punch, and an explosive sound rang out. The ghost slave screamed as a wisp of black smoke rose from its body.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing did not stop and continued his techniques, one man against two ghosts, with overwhelming momentum.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts were divided into fighting techniques and training methods. Training methods were fundamental to improving one's realm, but basically, every training method had some techniques that could be used for fighting.</p><p></p><p>The Bull Form training method was also a type of boxing, and some of its techniques could naturally be used to fight enemies!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing had just entered the Flesh Realm, but his comprehension was extremely good, and his strength far surpassed those of the same level. The training method he had learned just by watching once also had some power in his hands.</p><p></p><p>Between punches and kicks, the vigorous qi and blood naturally spread out, rubbing against the yin and evil qi.</p><p></p><p>The two ghost slaves were no match for Zhou Qing at all!</p><p></p><p>The scene unfolding before Huang Shiren's eyes exceeded his imagination. Huang Shiren abruptly stood up, utterly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"A warrior?!!"</p><p></p><p>"Becoming a warrior in one day of practicing martial arts, how is this possible!"</p>

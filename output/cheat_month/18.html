            <p>Chapter 18: Soaring Dragon (Please keep reading!)</p><p></p><p>A black and long shadow shot towards Zhou Qing like a sharp arrow, stirring up turbulent currents with extreme speed. </p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's heart trembled as his spiritual power burst out from his body, striking the black shadow.</p><p></p><p>After a cultivator enters the state of visualization, with just a little practice, techniques like spiritual impact and controlling objects can be quickly mastered.</p><p></p><p>Under the spiritual impact, the black shadow slowed down for an instant, giving Zhou Qing reaction time.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing dodged to the side while the shaft of the Eagle Beak Spear appeared in his hand, fiercely smashing towards the black shadow.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>It actually dodged Zhou Qing's attack!</p><p></p><p>It was a black snake as thick as a baby's arm. Its scales were dark and glossy, its forked tongue flickering silently.</p><p></p><p>"Aquatic monster?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing stared at the black snake. A snake that could evade his attacks was undoubtedly a monster.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you also have your eyes on this spirit plant..."</p><p></p><p>The black snake lightly swayed its tail and shot out again, its mouth open, fangs clearly visible.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the black snake's entanglement, Zhou Qing showed no intention of leaving.</p><p></p><p>Since he encountered this spirit plant, he definitely could not let it go.</p><p></p><p>In this section of the Cloud River near Black Cloud Town, there were no overly powerful monsters.</p><p></p><p>He still used the most basic soul attack technique, leading with a spiritual impact to affect the black snake's spirit.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing wielded the Eagle Beak Spear shaft with great prowess, but the black snake was simply too fast, dodging several of Zhou Qing's attacks. The environmental boost it received was too great.</p><p></p><p>Even with the Water Avoidance Pearl, compared to this kind of aquatic monster, Zhou Qing was at a great disadvantage in this environment. </p><p></p><p>However, Zhou Qing was very patient, not panicking or getting anxious. In the past few days, he had sparred with other senior disciples many times, accumulating some combat experience.</p><p></p><p>In the black snake's next charge, Zhou Qing unleashed his spiritual impact at maximum power, then actively used his hand to meet the black snake.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhou Qing not using the spear shaft and being affected by the spiritual impact multiple times, the black snake, with its low intelligence nearly gone, became extremely enraged and directly crashed towards Zhou Qing's hand.</p><p></p><p>I'll smash you to death!</p><p></p><p>A huge impact was transmitted from his hand, but delight flashed in Zhou Qing's eyes as he directly grabbed the black snake and brought the shaft down.</p><p></p><p>The black snake struggled frantically, but its stamina was far from its peak, and its speed had finally slowed.</p><p></p><p>There was no sound in the water, but the spear shaft solidly struck the black snake's body.</p><p></p><p>The black snake stiffened for a moment. Without hesitation, Zhou Qing landed a second blow.</p><p></p><p>The struggling force in his hand suddenly disappeared. The black snake was motionless.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing didn't understand much about monsters like the black snake, so to prevent it from faking death, Zhou Qing gave it a few more vicious hits, directly smashing the snake into several segments before feeling at ease.</p><p></p><p>Martial weapon fragments, if nothing else, were hard enough.</p><p></p><p>Are you stupid? I have Hundred Refined Gloves, what do you have? </p><p></p><p>Using your head to crash into a Hundred Refined weapon, don't tell me your snake head is also a Hundred Refined snake head?</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing went to pick the spirit plant, then brought the several sections of the black snake's body and swam towards the river surface.</p><p></p><p>With the black snake dead, its blood spread out. Zhou Qing didn't dare linger in the river. If the smell of blood attracted other monsters, that would be terrible.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, the glow of the Water Avoidance Pearl was already extremely faint.</p><p></p><p>Before Zhou Qing could even leave the Cloud River, the Water Avoidance Pearl lost its effect, and the cold river water slapped haphazardly on Zhou Qing's face.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he wasn't far from the surface, so Zhou Qing swam up by himself.</p><p></p><p>"Pah!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing surfaced from the water, climbed up, his entire body already soaked through.</p><p></p><p>Wringing out the water from his clothes, looking at his fortuitous gain, Zhou Qing smiled.</p><p></p><p>He had obtained spirit plants before, but obtaining a spirit plant in this manner was a first.</p><p></p><p>Without delay, Zhou Qing prepared to return to the martial arts hall. But just then, three people saw Zhou Qing from afar and walked over in this direction.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing also noticed those three people and furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>They seemed to be... people from the Soaring Dragon Martial Arts Hall?</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing had no intention of encountering them and prepared to leave from another direction. </p><p></p><p>However, Zhou Qing quietly re-equipped the Hundred Refined Gloves, and put one hand into the river, equipping the Eagle Beak Spear shaft under the water, then took it out.</p><p></p><p>Due to the game-like characteristics of the Immortal Tree Secret Realm, although storage spaces couldn't be made, dropped items could be taken out and used at any time.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhou Qing turn around and leave...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The three people quickened their pace.</p><p></p><p>"Stop right there!" </p><p></p><p>Of course, Zhou Qing wouldn't stop. I'm not your father, why should I indulge you like that?</p><p></p><p>However, the three still caught up with Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>"The new disciple taken in by the Taibai Pavilion Master? Indeed quite old."</p><p></p><p>The leader recognized Zhou Qing's identity from his attire, and a mocking smile immediately appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"That old man Bai Tian, back then he was unwilling to accept me, a young genius, but now he has taken in a useless person of your age."</p><p></p><p>"What are you carrying inside your clothes?"</p><p></p><p>"None of your business."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing looked at the three. The one speaking was wearing the attire of a Tenglong Martial Hall disciple, while the other two were dressed as apprentices. </p><p></p><p>The Taibai Martial Hall apprentices didn't have uniforms, but the other two major martial halls were different and easily recognizable.</p><p></p><p>And judging from his words, he had almost been accepted as a disciple by Bai Tian?</p><p></p><p>"How dare you not listen to me?" Yang Xing frowned and actually made a move against Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>What kind of brainless idiot had he encountered this time?</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing immediately counterattacked, sweeping his staff across.</p><p></p><p>Yang Xing's body flashed, dodging it, his hand in an eagle claw shape, going straight for Zhou Qing's chest at an extremely fast speed.</p><p></p><p>When he made his move, a faint luster actually appeared on his skin. </p><p></p><p>Shining skin membrane, this was the peak of the Flesh Boundary!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing wielded the staff in front of his chest, blocking Yang Xing's palm strike, but the terrifying power of the peak Flesh Boundary still sent Zhou Qing flying back, while also exposing some of the spirit plants inside his clothes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yang Xing's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good, it turns out to be spirit plants! I didn't expect that after not gaining much in the Black Mountains, I would have such an opportunity upon returning!"</p><p></p><p>"Wang Da, Wang Er, let's attack together and subdue him as quickly as possible!"</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by the three, Zhou Qing felt it very difficult to handle.</p><p></p><p>The other two apprentices weren't at the peak of Flesh Boundary. Judging from their strength, Wang Da should have just entered, while Wang Er was at the initial stage.</p><p></p><p>But Zhou Qing himself had also just entered the Flesh Boundary!</p><p></p><p>"Bai Tian is quite generous, actually giving a new disciple like you a hundred-refined weapon." Yang Xing said, mistaking the identity of the staff.</p><p></p><p>"A hundred-refined weapon, I have one too."</p><p></p><p>Drawing his saber from its sheath, Yang Xing slashed horizontally with an imposing might. </p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing narrowed his eyes slightly, his inner Qi surging, swinging the staff in his hands with all his strength, directly clashing with Yang Xing head-on.</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>A notch actually appeared on Yang Xing's hundred-refined saber!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was also shaken back, almost falling to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The attacks from the other two landed without hesitation. Zhou Qing forcibly twisted his body, taking a punch from Wang Da head-on, using the staff as a shield to block a palm strike from Wang Er.</p><p></p><p>Then Zhou Qing forcefully swung the staff outwards, the strength greater than Wang Er's directly pushing him away, then the staff was raised high and brought down on Wang Er's chest.</p><p></p><p>Wang Er's chest slightly caved in as he was sent flying.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>While Zhou Qing was dealing with Wang Da and Wang Er, Yang Xing's saber directly slashed down on Zhou Qing's body, but was blocked by the inner armor. Amidst the clashing of metal, the saber edge didn't penetrate.</p><p></p><p>"A hundred-refined inner armor?!!" Yang Xing blurted out.</p><p></p><p>"Puff!"</p><p></p><p>The power of the peak Flesh Boundary was very strong. Zhou Qing directly spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, staining his clothes red.</p><p></p><p>"Brother!"</p><p></p><p>Then a startled cry was heard from Wang Da. He was no longer attacking Zhou Qing, but rushing towards Wang Er.</p><p></p><p>How could Wang Er be fine after being hit in the chest by Zhou Qing with the weapon fragments?</p><p></p><p>If not dead then crippled!</p><p></p><p>"The weapon in your hand isn't a hundred-refined one? How can your strength be so great?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, this is impossible!"</p><p></p><p>Yang Xing stared at Zhou Qing, his face extremely ugly.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's weapon shocked him, but what shocked him even more was Zhou Qing's strength. </p><p></p><p>This was definitely not the power someone who had just entered the Flesh Boundary should have!</p><p></p><p>Yang Xing found all of this unbelievable. Wasn't this supposed to be a useless person of older age?!!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing smiled, looking a bit ferocious due to the blood on his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Who do you think you're robbing?</p><p></p><p>I practice secret martial arts, what do you practice?</p><p></p><p>When I was still mortal, my physical body could rival martial artists. What level were you at that time?</p><p></p><p>From starting to practice martial arts until now, I have trained for four days.</p><p></p><p>Impossible?</p><p></p><p>What's impossible about it!</p><p></p><p>How can an ordinary person like you understand a genius like me!</p><p></p><p>Today's 5,000 character update, dear handsome readers please give some data support.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 26: The Sword Fairy Under the Moon (Please keep reading!)</p><p></p><p>The lecherous monks outside walked past the courtyard where Zhou Qing resided and headed in another direction. </p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing listened to their footsteps, estimating their distance from the women's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, Zhou Qing directly kicked open the door with one foot.</p><p></p><p>The few lecherous monks who had walked to the front of the courtyard were startled by the sound of the door being kicked open, and they all turned their heads to look over here.</p><p></p><p>What they saw, in addition to the icy-faced Zhou Qing, was a signal flare slowly rising.</p><p></p><p>The many lecherous monks were shocked and frightened. There was also the sound of doors being kicked open in the women's guest courtyard behind them, and Su Chang'an leaped out.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Su Chang'an's condition was a bit strange. His face was flushed red, and his eyes were a bit dazed, but he generally maintained his sobriety.</p><p></p><p>The incense in the women's guest courtyard had a bit more than the men's guest courtyard. It not only had the effect of making one dizzy, but it could also ignite lust and desire.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you? Coming to our Shanshui Temple to cause trouble? Take them down directly!"</p><p></p><p>The abbot who had brought Zhou Qing and the others in shouted, and then the warrior monks were divided into two groups, charging towards Zhou Qing and Su Chang'an to kill them.</p><p></p><p>A distance of several tens of meters could be crossed in a few steps for these warriors.</p><p></p><p>"Bastards! Such a loophole has appeared! If this matter is exposed, you few will all have to die!"</p><p></p><p>The abbot Neng Wu suddenly rushed up into the sky from a courtyard and flew directly over here!</p><p></p><p>He could actually fly!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was greatly shocked and turned to enter the room.</p><p></p><p>The few warriors chasing directly after him also did not have any hesitation. The unparalleled and violent power directly crashed through everything blocking them and rushed into the room.</p><p></p><p>As for Neng Wu, he did not bother with Zhou Qing and went for Su Chang'an, who was at the meridian realm.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The room Zhou Qing was in suddenly exploded. Zhou Qing was seen smacking one of the monks on the head with his spear, and the monk's head directly exploded.</p><p></p><p>The few monks chasing and killing him were only at the flesh and blood realm. Zhou Qing entered the room first. After discovering that Neng Wu did not come to chase him, he immediately decided to counterattack.</p><p></p><p>Under the sneak attack, he directly took care of a monk at the early stage of the flesh and blood realm!</p><p></p><p>The other monks saw this scene and were both shocked and angry. "Boy, you're seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>Three monks killed Zhou Qing together. Zhou Qing felt a piercing pain. The killing intent of the other party was too strong!</p><p></p><p>His qi and blood surged, and his inner qi rushed. Zhou Qing dodged the first round of attacks, and then immediately made a fierce counterattack. The hardness of the weapon fragments gave Zhou Qing a complete advantage in weapons. Fighting one against three, his might was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>The three warriors in front of Zhou Qing were all empty-handed. They would not possibly bring weapons to commit lewd acts.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, facing Zhou Qing's weapons with their flesh bodies was really too painful.</p><p></p><p>This battle was actually easier than Zhou Qing had imagined. Sure enough, Zhou Qing's hard work and cultivation in daily life had paid off!</p><p></p><p>Just then, a brilliant sword qi came across the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Humph, how dare you act so arrogantly in front of me!"</p><p></p><p>Looking forward, Bai Ruoyue stood in the courtyard, dressed in white, slowly inserting her sword into its sheath. The moonlight shone on her body, untainted by dust, a true sword fairy!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing looked at Bai Ruoyue like this and was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhou Qing's expression, Bai Ruoyue flicked the black hair by her ear and said with a smile, "How is it, little junior brother? Have you witnessed the power of your senior sister?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister..."</p><p></p><p>"No need to praise me."</p><p></p><p>Come praise me quickly!</p><p></p><p>"Can you not show up at the critical moment next time? It's very thrilling."</p><p></p><p>"Also, Senior Sister, if you had appeared a bit later, I could have taken care of them all by myself. You're stealing my limelight."</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue tightly gripped the sword in her hand, really wanting to draw it again.</p><p></p><p>I'll stab you to death on behalf of my father, you rebellious disciple who loves to annoy people!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing walked out from the ruins and looked towards Su Chang'an's direction, discovering that the few monks who were martial artists there had already been taken care of by other senior disciples.</p><p></p><p>Under the righteous group beating, the fate of these lecherous monks, whose highest cultivation was only at the Muscle Meridian stage, was already sealed.</p><p></p><p>They weren't all killed, some were left alive, after all there were still follow-up matters to handle regarding this incident.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the five senior monks who were martial artists, Cloud Mountain Temple surprisingly also had a few young novice monks who were martial artists, all at the beginning stage of Flesh and Skin realm, but Zhou Qing didn't see them during the day.</p><p></p><p>Neng Wu, who was flying in the air, saw the sudden change in the situation. Before he could do anything, he was both shocked and filled with hatred in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Taibai Martial Arts School? Very well, very well!"</p><p></p><p>"Just you wait, I will definitely avenge today's grudge!"</p><p></p><p>After uttering the vicious words, Neng Wu directly flew towards the distance, wanting to escape.</p><p></p><p>As long as the green hills remain, there's no fear of having no firewood to burn!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing just realized that Neng Wu's figure flying in the sky seemed a bit illusory, not like a physical body, but rather a bit like... a ghost.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, in front of where Neng Wu was flying, the primordial qi between heaven and earth started to churn. A primordial qi hand several meters wide appeared and directly grabbed Neng Wu.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the Profound Passage Great Hand Imprint!"</p><p></p><p>Neng Wu let out a miserable cry. Apart from his head, all other parts were crushed by that primordial qi hand, and then he was carried by it out of Mountain Water Temple.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to bother with what follows. I'll have them come handle it. Come see me tomorrow and bring the people beside you."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing watched dumbfounded. What kind of technique was this, a Daoist magic?</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, is this the expert you invited to help?" Zhou Qing asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed very high level..."</p><p></p><p>A single primordial qi hand imprint was several meters wide. The expert himself was probably over ten stories tall.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, Neng Wu probably wasn't physically flying in the air right?"</p><p></p><p>"That was his soul. The soul leaving the body naturally can rise from the ground, unlike a physical body that's restricted."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing guessed that this should be a soul technique.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, what you used earlier was the Taibai Sword Art?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it was precisely the move 'Flying Swallow Chasing the Moon'."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was very envious. That was sword qi! Wasn't it super cool?</p><p></p><p>"You're still laying the foundations now. The Taibai ultimate arts can't display much power in your hands." Bai Ruoyue saw through Zhou Qing's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"When you cultivate to the Organs stage, you'll also be able to do this."</p><p></p><p>"That will still take a long time..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yuantao and the others also walked over at this time, showing concern for Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>"Fourth Senior Brother, are you alright?"</p><p></p><p>Su Chang'an shook his head, still dressed in women's clothing, his face flushed red, making the others hold back laughter seeing him.</p><p></p><p>"The incense in the room contained some lewd things. Those women in the past fell for it like this."</p><p></p><p>This battle happened quickly and also ended quickly. The strength on Zhou Qing's side was overwhelmingly powerful. This group from Mountain Water Temple basically had no ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing and the few senior brothers and sisters joined forces to wipe out a den of demons.</p><p></p><p>But this brief battle also caused quite a commotion. However, those couples in the rear courtyard of Mountain Water Temple had no awareness at all of the disturbance outside and remained in deep slumber.</p><p></p><p>One could imagine how powerful the drug Neng Wu's group used was. No wonder they could do as they pleased to those women without any worries.</p><p></p><p>"There are still some young monks in Mountain Water Temple. Let's lock them up first." Bai Ruoyue said, </p><p></p><p>"In a bit, the government officials should be arriving."</p><p></p><p>"That expert is from the government?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue nodded.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's expression turned strange. Didn't you tell me not to report to the authorities?</p><p></p><p>I think you just wanted to chop people up, right!</p><p></p><p>A new week, please follow, read, send monthly tickets and rewards to boost the new book ranking!</p>

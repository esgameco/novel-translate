            <p>Chapter 3: Taibai</p><p></p><p>After learning that the changes happening to his body were a good thing, Zhou Qing left the Secret Realm of the Immortal Tree again.</p><p></p><p>Then, Zhou Qing took the Three-Light Fortune Mirror and scanned every corner of his house, but did not discover any other ghosts or monsters. Only then was Zhou Qing completely at ease.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't have the mirror, after just being tormented by a ghost, Zhou Qing definitely wouldn't dare to wander around alone in the middle of the night.</p><p></p><p>But now, possessing a magical artifact, his courage had expanded greatly. </p><p></p><p>If another ghost like the one earlier appeared, what would play out is a Celestial Master exorcising a ghost.</p><p></p><p>After returning to his room, he kept the Three-Light Fortune Mirror close to his body.</p><p></p><p>"The crisis has temporarily passed, but it may not be safe in the future..." Zhou Qing pondered.</p><p></p><p>Having just arrived and already encountering a ghost attack, he had been in a state of mental tension.</p><p></p><p>Only now did Zhou Qing have time to quietly think and carefully sort through the original body's memories.</p><p></p><p>The original body was now twenty-two years old. His parents were originally in business, but six years ago, they had died in an accident while away on business, leaving only this property to "Zhou Qing".</p><p></p><p>Originally, when Zhou Qing first arrived in Heiyun Town, some people, because they had some ties with the original body's parents, considered this inheritance to be quite secure.</p><p></p><p>But as time passed, the relationships the original body's parents once had faded away. When people are gone, their influence cools, nothing could be more realistic. Zhou Qing didn't blame them.</p><p></p><p>Three years ago, Huang Shiren came from out of town to settle in Heiyun Town, and later took a liking to the Zhou family residence. </p><p></p><p>The original body was an honest, kind-hearted and somewhat stubborn person. His parents' estate, naturally, could not be sold.</p><p></p><p>Losing this house, he would have no home.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Huang Shiren was not sincerely trying to make a deal at all, but was bullying the solitary "Zhou Qing", using the name of a transaction to forcibly seize it.</p><p></p><p>The price he offered wasn't even enough to buy an outhouse in the worst part of Heiyun Town. </p><p></p><p>It was purely bullying an honest person.</p><p></p><p>"Having failed to harm me this time, Huang Shiren will surely not stop. He is a wealthy man in town with considerable influence. I am alone. To deal with the crises that may arise in the future, there is only one way..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing thought of some scenes from the original body's memories and had already made a decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He must take the martial arts examination!</p><p></p><p>No, he must practice martial arts!</p><p></p><p>Martial force is not the only way to solve problems, but it is definitely the simplest and most effective way.</p><p></p><p>Now, in terms of his soul, he had already entered the Sensing Stage, a step ahead of his physical body.</p><p></p><p>But he lacked the relevant cultivation knowledge and methods, and could not actively exert the power of his soul.</p><p></p><p>In Heiyun Town, there might be soul cultivators, but Zhou Qing had never heard any concrete and real information.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing suspected that the ghost that harmed him was probably related to the soul cultivation system. Huang Shiren, as an outsider, had a much higher chance of coming into contact with these things than the locals of Heiyun Town.</p><p></p><p>Despicable outsider!</p><p></p><p>He couldn't possibly go to Huang Shiren to seek relevant knowledge.</p><p></p><p>But physical cultivation, practicing martial arts, that was different.</p><p></p><p>Martial artists were not few in number in Heiyun Town, and there were even martial arts halls openly accepting students.</p><p></p><p>Every martial artist had astonishing strength, easily able to fight a hundred people, and had an extremely high status in Heiyun Town.</p><p></p><p>After making his plans, Zhou Qing let out a sigh of relief. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw some money carelessly thrown on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Earth Bank!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing immediately remembered his first golden finger and hurriedly went to collect the scattered coins.</p><p></p><p>There was copper, silver, and even one or two gold pieces.</p><p></p><p>In the short time he possessed the Heavenly Earth Bank, he had already obtained this wealth. Thinking of the Heavenly Earth Bank's abilities, Zhou Qing's heart ached to the point he couldn't breathe.</p><p></p><p>If he could have kept the Heavenly Earth Bank...</p><p></p><p>The bank, my bank, come back!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing collapsed on the bed, reminiscing about his lost golden finger.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing also conducted some experiments on the Secret Realm of the Immortal Tree, such as bringing things from this world into it.</p><p></p><p>Then Zhou Qing discovered that he could bring things in, but as soon as he came out, the things from this world would be expelled along with him. Only items dropped by the Immortal Tree could be kept in the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>The dream of using the Secret Realm of the Immortal Tree as storage space was also shattered, which was regrettable.</p><p></p><p>What Zhou Qing didn't expect next was that he actually couldn't fall asleep all night.</p><p></p><p>Neither his body nor his spirit showed the slightest hint of fatigue, feeling like he had boundless energy.</p><p></p><p>This was obviously related to that strand of Life Origin and Zhou Qing entering the Sensing Stage.</p><p></p><p>This made Zhou Qing feel a bit emotional. Cultivation was simply a blessing for those night owls on Earth.</p><p></p><p>But if you can't cultivate, what are you staying up for? Don't tell me you're really cultivating immortality?</p><p></p><p>When the sky brightened, Zhou Qing also discovered that cultivation was not only a blessing for night owls, but also a "good medicine".</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because his energy was too vigorous, Zhou Qing's good brother had been flapping its wings, wanting to fly for a long time. It was quite real...</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the long sword was sharp but idle, the hero had no place to use his skills.</p><p></p><p>After washing up, Zhou Qing looked at himself in the mirror. The look of being on the verge of death from last night was gone, already back to normal.</p><p></p><p>If he relied on ordinary methods of nourishment, who knows how much time it would take, how much money it would cost, for Zhou Qing's body to recover to its original state.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had the Life Origin dropped by the Great Thousand Immortal Tree.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this Zhou Qing looked shockingly similar to his original self, with only some differences in the details.</p><p></p><p>Still the same handsome and dashing appearance.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go take a look at the martial arts halls today. The three great martial arts halls... I'll go to Taibai Martial Arts Hall. This name, it's so familiar."</p><p></p><p>Taibai, and a martial arts hall at that, reminded Zhou Qing of his "sword practicing" days in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>Heiyun Town had three great martial arts halls: Tenglong, Kuangdao, and Taibai. Among them, Taibai Martial Arts Hall had the best public reputation.</p><p></p><p>Right now, Zhou Qing just wanted to find a stable environment to quickly master the transcendent powers of this world.</p><p></p><p>Although, one of the main reasons Taibai Martial Arts Hall had the best reputation was that Taibai Martial Arts Hall's tuition was relatively low...</p><p></p><p>This was also something Zhou Qing valued.</p><p></p><p>Although the original body's parents were in business, when they died in that accident back then, most of the money had already been converted into goods and taken away. They didn't leave much for "Zhou Qing".</p><p></p><p>Six years had passed. It could be said that apart from this house, Zhou Qing had nothing and lived very frugally.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing rummaged through boxes and cabinets before finally finding...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Some money, barely enough to pay the tuition fee for Taibai Martial Arts School.</p><p></p><p>As for the wealth obtained from Tiandi Money House, Zhou Qing decided to keep it for now.</p><p></p><p>What if he could use this money to refresh Tiandi Money House again in the future?</p><p></p><p>At least there was still hope.</p><p></p><p>With the silver, Zhou Qing left home.</p><p></p><p>Just as he walked out the door, Zhou Qing keenly noticed someone peeking at him from a corner.</p><p></p><p>The previous night had brought great changes to Zhou Qing, and his five senses were enhanced.</p><p></p><p>Pretending to look at the corner unintentionally, he found that it was a person dressed as a servant.</p><p></p><p>"It must be someone sent by the Huang family."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing didn't pay much attention to that person and walked towards Taibai Martial Arts School according to the route in his memory.</p><p></p><p>Heiyun Town was called a town, but it was actually quite large, like a small city, and it was quite prosperous.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing first bought some food on the roadside and filled his stomach, which only cost a few coins.</p><p></p><p>When he arrived in front of the martial arts school, he looked at the plaque, and the characters on it were like a dragon and a snake. Zhou Qing could sense a sharp feeling from it with his spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Little Zhou?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing turned around and saw a middle-aged man and a teenager who looked about fifteen or sixteen years old.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Li." Zhou Qing said.</p><p></p><p>Li Guangyuan had visited "Zhou Qing's" parents a few times when they were still alive.</p><p></p><p>"It's really you, Little Zhou." Li Guangyuan looked at Zhou Qing with surprise in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's complexion was too good, even better than those young masters from wealthy families who were well-fed and well-dressed.</p><p></p><p>"Little Zhou, what are you doing at Taibai Martial Arts School?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing answered honestly, "I'm going to learn martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Li Guangyuan was stunned for a moment and said, "If I remember correctly, Little Zhou, you're already twenty-two years old, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Learning martial arts at this age, it might be a bit difficult to achieve something."</p><p></p><p>It's not just a bit difficult, it's extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Just practicing casually, it's not bad to be able to exercise the body." Zhou Qing said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Learning martial arts was something that couldn't be hidden, but there was no need to tell others about the deeper things.</p><p></p><p>Li Guangyuan shook his head and didn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>After all, it wasn't his money being spent, and it wasn't his son, so he didn't care that much. He just said it casually earlier.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing and Li Guangyuan entered the martial arts school together. The other teenager was Li Guangyuan's son, Li Wu, who was fifteen years old this year and also came to learn martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"My son has been smart since he was young, and his body is not bad. I thought about sending him here to practice martial arts and see if he can make it." Li Guangyuan's words contained a bit of pride and expectations for Li Wu.</p><p></p><p>The teenager was quite arrogant. He only glanced at Zhou Qing, this "old thing", and didn't talk to Zhou Qing. Zhou Qing didn't mind either.</p><p></p><p>In both lifetimes, he was an adult, so naturally, he wouldn't have any opinions about a teenager's arrogance. He was just a child.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, Zhou Qing even smiled and praised Li Wu to Li Guangyuan, saying that this child would definitely achieve great things in the future, which made Li Guangyuan even happier.</p><p></p><p>After entering the martial arts school, they found the registration office. There was a long table inside, and a seventeen or eighteen-year-old beautiful girl wearing a training uniform was sitting behind the long table. She looked up at Zhou Qing and the other two.</p><p></p><p>There was a dedicated registration office, and it was a girl in charge. It was indeed a world with extraordinary powers, different from the ancient times in the previous life...</p><p></p><p>"Registration?" The girl spoke, her voice clear and beautiful.</p><p></p><p>"My name is Bai Ruoyue, a disciple of the martial arts school, and also one of your teachers in the future." Bai Ruoyue said,</p><p></p><p>"Come over."</p><p></p><p>Li Wu went up first, and Bai Ruoyue began to register the information. Soon it was Zhou Qing's turn.</p><p></p><p>"Name?"</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing, Qing as in clear water."</p><p></p><p>"Age?"</p><p></p><p>"Twenty-two."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this number, Bai Ruoyue looked up at Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>However, seeing Zhou Qing's ruddy face full of vitality, she didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>"Where do you live?"</p><p></p><p>"Heiyun Town..."</p><p></p><p>Three questions were quickly registered.</p><p></p><p>"The tuition fee is fifteen taels of silver, and the teaching time is four months."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing readily paid the silver. The other two martial arts schools, one required eighteen taels, and the other was even more expensive, requiring twenty taels, and they only taught for three months.</p><p></p><p>It was very expensive, and ordinary families definitely couldn't afford it. For Zhou Qing, this tuition fee also emptied his family's savings.</p><p></p><p>Except for the money dropped by Tiandi Money House.</p><p></p><p>"Swish! Swish!"</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue handed the registration certificates to Zhou Qing and Li Wu and said,</p><p></p><p>"Go in through the door behind me. Family members, stop here."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Guangyuan instructed Li Wu a few words. Li Wu impatiently responded a few times and left directly.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing smiled and said goodbye to Li Guangyuan, and was about to leave when Li Guangyuan called out to him.</p><p></p><p>"Little Zhou, your parents and I had a pretty good relationship when they were alive. You've had a hard time these past few years. Work hard when learning martial arts." Li Guangyuan said.</p><p></p><p>Maybe it was because Zhou Qing, someone else's son, had a better attitude towards him than his own son, so he also instructed Zhou Qing a few words.</p><p></p><p>In fact, people are always like this. They vent their bad temper on their family members without restraint, but they always show their good side in front of strangers.</p><p></p><p>But Zhou Qing was called again.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Bai, what's the matter?" After saying that, Zhou Qing felt that the title "Teacher Bai" sounded a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>"What's your family situation like?" Bai Ruoyue asked a question that Zhou Qing didn't expect.</p><p></p><p>I'm just here to take a training class, why are you asking about my family situation?</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing thought for a moment and answered honestly,</p><p></p><p>"Not very good, living alone."</p><p></p><p>"You can go back now." Bai Ruoyue nodded and said,</p><p></p><p>"Give me the certificate, I'll refund the tuition fee to you. Take the tuition fee and leave."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing frowned. What did this mean?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that my humble background and orphan status made me unworthy of studying at your martial arts school?</p><p></p><p>What a clichéd plot!</p><p></p><p>Three chapters and ten thousand words presented.</p><p></p><p>During the new book period, following and reading are the most important.

            <p>Chapter 14: Senior Sister Can't Take It Anymore (Please keep reading!)</p><p></p><p>"Recovering quite well."</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian glanced at Zhou Qing and found that his body had healed a lot. </p><p></p><p>"The healing medicine in the pavilion is very effective."</p><p></p><p>Then Zhou Qing immediately turned the topic to the visualization chart.</p><p></p><p>"Master, do you understand the cultivation of souls?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian nodded, "When I was young and adventuring outside, I learned a bit about it."</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating the physical body and practicing martial arts is for warriors."</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating the soul and practicing Daoist methods is for cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"The two paths are not superior or inferior to each other. They are both great ways leading to the heavens. It's said that when cultivated to a profound level, one can possess incredible abilities."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing asked again, "Then can martial arts and Daoist methods be cultivated together?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, as long as you have the talent for it," Bai Tian said. </p><p></p><p>"However, warriors are common while cultivators are rare. The threshold for cultivating Daoist methods is much higher than that for martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"Interested in Daoist methods?" Bai Tian asked.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Your talent in the martial dao is exceptional. I don't recommend you divert your attention to Daoist methods. Besides, whether you have the talent for cultivating Daoist methods is still an unknown."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the ghost attack has piqued your interest in Daoist methods, but warriors are not inferior to cultivators. In fact, in the early stages of cultivation, warriors have the advantage. You don't need to be fixated on it."</p><p></p><p>Cultivating both martial arts and Daoist methods sounds impressive, but either path requires a lifetime of pursuit. </p><p></p><p>Cultivating both will greatly impact the speed of cultivation, and the demand for resources will be immense.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating both leads to a boundless future, but the reality is extremely cruel.</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian's advice was reasonable, but Zhou Qing's situation was unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I think I should also have some talent in cultivating Daoist methods." Zhou Qing said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>"I've already sensed the Soul Realm, just the night before last."</p><p></p><p>"???"</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian naturally knew what the Soul Realm was.</p><p></p><p>But was this reasonable?</p><p></p><p>"After being attacked by the ghost that night, I sensed the Soul Realm. But before obtaining the Yaksha Visualization Method, I didn't know what it was."</p><p></p><p>"Born with abundant soul, the Soul Realm opens on its own..."</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian muttered, looking at his disciple with an indescribable expression.</p><p></p><p>Is this a disciple I, Bai Tian, can receive?</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Bai Tian said,</p><p></p><p>"If that's really the case, then your talent in Daoist methods is excellent, not inferior to your talent in the martial dao."</p><p></p><p>In the Daoist way, the Soul Realm opens on its own.</p><p></p><p>In the martial way, one is born with innate vitality.</p><p></p><p>Both reach the peak state below the entry level without needing deliberate cultivation, the best condition.</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian suddenly sighed with some regret.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that you experienced the ghost calamity. The foundations of your physical body and soul have been damaged. Otherwise, your talent would be even more astonishing."</p><p></p><p>"Too bad you can't cultivate with the most supreme talent. Not being able to see you like that is regrettable."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing remained silent.</p><p></p><p>This misunderstanding was getting bigger and bigger.</p><p></p><p>"Master, do you have any understanding of visualization charts?" Zhou Qing chose to avoid the topic and brought up what he cared about.</p><p></p><p>"I have some understanding, but I don't have any visualization charts on hand," Bai Tian said.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivators visualize certain things within their Soul Realm to strengthen their soul power and give it some special properties. If they can achieve flawless visualization, they can begin to break through to the next realm."</p><p></p><p>"Landscapes, objects, living beings, etc. can all be used for visualization. It's said that some top-grade visualization charts depict legendary sacred beings and possess incredible effects."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Bai Tian shook his head, "But those are just legends. I've never seen such visualization charts."</p><p></p><p>"The Yaksha Visualization Chart in your hands should be considered quite good."</p><p></p><p>"Then what if I directly visualize the sun?" Zhou Qing let his imagination run wild.</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian laughed and said,</p><p></p><p>"Visualization is not blind imagination."</p><p></p><p>"If you arbitrarily visualize the sun,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"In the end, what appears in your soul's homeland will only be a sphere of light, without the form or spirit of the sun, unless you have an engraving of the sun's true form and divine charm."</p><p></p><p>"I don't have a visualization chart, but if I can get close to the sun and not miss any part of it, is there a possibility of successful visualization?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's possible. The visualization charts were created by our predecessors. How did they visualize without charts?"</p><p></p><p>"They all faced the true myriad things of heaven and earth directly."</p><p></p><p>Visualizing the great thousand immortal trees is feasible!</p><p></p><p>"Master, you know so much," Zhou Qing exclaimed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>"When you've been to many places and met many people in the future, you will also comprehend a lot of knowledge."</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian said, suddenly a little lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Since you possess such outstanding Dao talent, put it to use." Bai Tian came back to his senses and exhorted:</p><p></p><p>"As for that Yaksha visualization chart, don't cultivate it for now. Let me see if I can find a better one."</p><p></p><p>"The government offices might yield some results."</p><p></p><p>Looking at Bai Tian, Zhou Qing suddenly felt mixed emotions.</p><p></p><p>This master he had apprenticed to just two days ago treated him too well, so well that he was a bit unaccustomed to it.</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to say he didn't need a visualization chart, but didn't know how to express it.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing decided to go think about how to explain it to his master.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I won't let you down."</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian smiled and didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing left Bai Tian and went to find Bai Ruoyue.</p><p></p><p>According to Bai Tian's arrangement, he had to spend a certain amount of time learning from Bai Ruoyue every day.</p><p></p><p>When he found Bai Ruoyue, she was practicing martial arts in the backyard and didn't stop upon noticing Zhou Qing's arrival.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing watched from the side. After a while, he inwardly exclaimed in admiration, wonderful!</p><p></p><p>The martial arts training clothes were very loose, concealing Bai Ruoyue's figure on normal days.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, as Bai Ruoyue made various movements, her exquisite, "plump" figure was accentuated.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought, the kind-hearted Bai was actually a fatty!</p><p></p><p>With a devout attitude of learning martial arts, Zhou Qing watched Bai Ruoyue practice intently, his eyes filled with innocence.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the matter of practicing martial arts is pure!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, are there any methods to quickly temper the physical body and enhance internal energy?"</p><p></p><p>While learning, Zhou Qing took a moment to ask a question.</p><p></p><p>"Eating higher-level demon beast meat or consuming spiritual plants can have this effect."</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual plants?"</p><p></p><p>"Some plants that contain abundant vitality and special energy are very precious and have miraculous effects on cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"I've eaten a few in the past. Each time I consumed them, my cultivation would greatly progress in a short period of time."</p><p></p><p>"Then where can one find such spiritual plants?"</p><p></p><p>"In the Black Mountains, beneath the Cloud River, both have them, but the former produces more."</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue glanced at Zhou Qing and tapped his head with a book.</p><p></p><p>"How long have you been practicing martial arts? Why are you thinking about these things?"</p><p></p><p>"If my father obtains more spiritual plants in the future, he will definitely share some with you. You don't need to be anxious."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing nodded inwardly. It seemed that although spiritual plants were very useful, they weren't particularly rare.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister."</p><p></p><p>"What is it now?"</p><p></p><p>"I went back and practiced a bit more last night. I feel like my internal energy has greatly increased. When do you think I can complete the physical refinement stage?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing planned to continue reinforcing his image as a genius. This way, no matter what he did in the future, Bai Ruoyue and the others would be able to accept it.</p><p></p><p>"How much can internal energy increase from just practicing for one night?" Bai Ruoyue smiled, not quite believing it. She thought her junior brother might not have woken up properly.</p><p></p><p>There was a limit to being a genius.</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look."</p><p></p><p>Placing a hand on Zhou Qing's shoulder, the smile on Bai Ruoyue's face froze.</p><p></p><p>How could he have so much?</p><p></p><p>So much, and so hot.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue really couldn't take it anymore.</p><p></p><p>Seeking follows and votes.

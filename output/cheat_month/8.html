            <p>Chapter 8: Breakthrough, Warrior!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing really wanted to go out and see if the place he had joined was called Taibai Martial Hall or Oblique Moon Three Star Cave.</p><p></p><p>"Secret martial arts are extremely important, even among the major martial arts sects outside of Black Cloud Town," Bai Tian said.</p><p></p><p>"The secret martial arts I possess are not trivial. I once had some grudges outside, so I asked you not to reveal them. Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>"I understand, I will be careful in the future."</p><p></p><p>"The secret martial art I'm going to teach you is called 'Ping Tian Niu Mo Lian Xing'. If you can master this secret martial art, you can lay the most superior foundation in the realm of flesh and blood, not inferior to anyone."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's heart stirred, realizing that his teacher seemed to be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>If the three major training methods in Taibai Boxing were considered superior in Black Cloud Town, then judging from Bai Tian's tone, this 'Ping Tian Niu Mo Lian Xing' was the best in the entire world.</p><p></p><p>The difference between them was more than obvious.</p><p></p><p>How did Bai Tian, a martial arts hall practitioner, obtain such a thing?</p><p></p><p>However, the name of this secret martial art, Ping Tian Niu Mo... was quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>"I gave my other disciples the opportunity to learn secret martial arts as well, but unfortunately they did not meet the requirements and could not master them," Bai Tian sighed.</p><p></p><p>"I hope you can succeed."</p><p></p><p>Next, Bai Tian began to teach Zhou Qing this secret martial art, with Bai Ruoyue assisting from the side.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he started, Zhou Qing felt the extraordinary nature of this secret martial art. Although it had the word "ox" in it like the Ox Form Practice, the secret martial art was like a mythical magic ox, while the Ox Form Practice was at most a ferocious beast of the ox clan.</p><p></p><p>With each posture and evolution of the moves, Zhou Qing felt as if his body was undergoing some changes, and even a sense of soreness.</p><p></p><p>This soreness intensified as he delved deeper into the 'Ping Tian Niu Mo Lian Xing', evolving into severe pain by the last few moves of the secret martial art.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a demon ox was rampaging inside his body, about to tear Zhou Qing apart, almost making it impossible for him to maintain the posture of the secret martial art.</p><p></p><p>In the realm of flesh and blood, accumulating inner qi was important, but more crucial was tempering the skin and forging the flesh, strengthening one's body to a transcendent level.</p><p></p><p>"Hold on, it's the final step!"</p><p></p><p>"Moo!"</p><p></p><p>Faintly, a roaring sound rang in Zhou Qing's ears, and a black, towering demon ox seemed to flash before his eyes!</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's body suddenly made a strange sound, his muscles trembling. A mysterious heat flow appeared inside his body, and a sheen flowed over his skin and flesh, disappearing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Small vortexes even appeared around him, as if something in heaven and earth was being absorbed into Zhou Qing's body.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's eyes snapped open, a black light flashing in them.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Senior Sister, did I succeed?"</p><p></p><p>"You did it, Junior Brother, you mastered it!" Bai Ruoyue nodded, somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing mastering the secret martial art meant a boundless future, signifying that the Taibai Martial Hall, her home, would become even better in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Not only did you master the secret martial art, but you also broke through to the realm of flesh and blood, giving birth to inner qi within your body." A smile appeared on Bai Tian's face.</p><p></p><p>This extraordinary man's attitude underwent some subtle changes after Zhou Qing mastered the secret martial art.</p><p></p><p>"So the thing scurrying around inside me like a little mouse is the inner qi of a warrior..." Zhou Qing's expression changed as he thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"But I haven't undergone nourishment yet?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian explained, "With your physique, you have naturally completed nourishment. Who can compare to you after completing nourishment?"</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Bai Tian was not surprised that Zhou Qing broke through and became a warrior after practicing the secret martial art once. This was something he had anticipated.</p><p></p><p>For Zhou Qing's talent, entering the martial dao was not a difficult hurdle.</p><p></p><p>This was one of the effects of that life essence.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing understood and felt his strong physique, feeling somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>"I feel like I have a lot of strength now."</p><p></p><p>"You have extraordinary talent and have learned the secret martial art, maximizing your potential. So every breakthrough you make will far surpass others."</p><p></p><p>"With your current physique, you have at least a thousand jin of strength. If you use inner qi, it will be even more terrifying."</p><p></p><p>Having just entered the realm of flesh and blood, merely crossing the threshold of the martial dao, yet possessing a thousand jin of strength, Zhou Qing was extremely satisfied.</p><p></p><p>What many disciples couldn't achieve in four months, he accomplished in one morning!</p><p></p><p>"To celebrate Junior Brother's breakthrough, let's have a good meal today!" Bai Ruoyue was very happy.</p><p></p><p>The three of them walked towards the dining area.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the way, Baitian was still instructing Zhou Qing on some matters during the day.</p><p></p><p>"For a warrior, practicing techniques is important, but eating is equally important."</p><p></p><p>"With each breakthrough, the physical body will be greatly enhanced. The energy required for this enhancement does not come out of thin air. Part of the energy comes from absorbing the qi of heaven and earth, while part of the energy is provided by the food eaten on a regular basis."</p><p></p><p>"Mundane food cannot keep up with the consumption of warriors, so most warriors eat the flesh of fierce beasts and spiritual creatures!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing nodded, understanding this principle.</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, eating is a fundamental aspect of being a warrior." Baitian said, "Some veteran warriors have developed many secret techniques that allow warriors to more efficiently utilize the qi in food."</p><p></p><p>"Without swallowing secret techniques, if you can absorb thirty percent of the qi from a pound of fierce beast meat, that's already not bad. But if you use swallowing secret techniques, that pound of fierce beast meat can fully exert the effect of three to five pounds or even more."</p><p></p><p>"When the swallowing secret technique is cultivated to a profound level, even if you eat dirt or stones at your current realm, you can still digest it and survive!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>By the time they reached the dining area, Baitian had completely told Zhou Qing about the Tun Ri Fa (Swallowing Sun Method), the secret swallowing technique that complements the secret martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing discovered that some of the martial arts principles and professional terms involved in the Tun Ri Fa were previously explained to him by Bai Ruoyue, so he could understand them right away. </p><p></p><p>They came prepared.</p><p></p><p>Among various martial arts, although the difficulty of swallowing secret techniques is relatively low, it is simple to get started, let alone cultivating it to a profound level.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how simple, it cannot be mastered in the time it takes to walk a few steps.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing said he had practiced the "Ping Tian Mo Niu Lian Xing" (Subduing Heavenly Demon Ox Body Tempering), but in fact he had only practiced it once and was able to perform all the moves, which naturally did not require much time.</p><p></p><p>Secret martial arts are like this. If you can learn it the first time, there is no problem. If you can't learn it the first time, it means you have no affinity with it.</p><p></p><p>The most important point for Zhou Qing to break through in half a day was that his physical body was already comparable to that of a warrior.</p><p></p><p>At the dining table, Zhou Qing also met his several martial brothers and sisters.</p><p></p><p>Baitian previously had six disciples. Zhou Qing had four martial brothers and two martial sisters. Now there were five in the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>After getting to know them, Zhou Qing started eating ravenously.</p><p></p><p>He was really hungry. After breaking through to a new realm, one needs to nourish the body.</p><p></p><p>The table was full of fierce beast meat, which tasted very good. Eating it made the body feel warm, and he even felt his strength increasing.</p><p></p><p>After the meal, the martial siblings chatted for a bit, and then Zhou Qing was called to practice again.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was practicing the secret martial arts while Baitian was talking beside him.</p><p></p><p>"The martial dao is ultimately about cultivating the physical body."</p><p></p><p>"In the realm of skin and flesh, the focus is on skin and flesh. Secret martial arts temper the skin and flesh, and inner qi can also strengthen the skin and flesh."</p><p></p><p>"In addition, the process can be accelerated through beating, medicinal baths, and other methods."</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry about the decoctions and medicinal baths. As my disciple, I will prepare them for you. What you need to do is to focus on tempering your skin and flesh and strengthening your inner qi."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing didn't speak, concentrating on practicing martial arts, but he was very grateful to Baitian in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if all masters would be like this to their disciples, but Baitian was really very responsible.</p><p></p><p>The entire afternoon, Baitian was instructing Zhou Qing in his cultivation and imparting martial dao knowledge to him.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Zhou Qing also took a medicinal bath, relieving the fatigue of the day and restoring vitality to his physical body.</p><p></p><p>After having another good meal at the martial arts hall, Zhou Qing left and went home.</p><p></p><p>When he arrived at the doorstep, Zhou Qing was surprised to find that the door of his house was already broken. Four people were guarding the entrance. Seeing Zhou Qing return, they all surrounded him.</p><p></p><p>"You're Zhou Qing, right? Master Huang invites you to come with us." One of the burly men said coldly, placing his hand on Zhou Qing's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing glanced at the few people. They all looked like they had him under control. Among them, two had well-developed muscles and an imposing manner. Zhou Qing suspected they were warriors.</p><p></p><p>Huang Shiren was a wealthy man in town. It was very normal for him to have the money to hire warriors, but they were probably only at the skin and flesh realm. Warriors of higher realms would not stoop to do such things.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing took another look at his home.</p><p></p><p>The door was broken. These people had probably barged in already.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, when he left the house this morning, he took the land deed and house deed with him.</p><p></p><p>That's how cautious he was.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go. I'll go with you to see Huang."</p><p></p><p>Today, he would go and see how many eyes this Huang fellow actually had.</p><p></p><p>Three chapters in a row. Asking for some data points.</p>

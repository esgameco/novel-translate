            <p>Chapter 1: Seven Days of Encountering Ghosts, The Great Thousand Immortal Tree</p><p></p><p>"Hoo!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing abruptly sat up, gasping for air, and touched his face and body with both hands.</p><p></p><p>"I wasn't hit and killed by a car?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Zhou Qing's head felt like it was about to explode, and a large amount of memories surfaced.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Dynasty, Heiyun Town, Zhou Qing..."</p><p></p><p>These suddenly emerging chaotic memories showed Zhou Qing the life of another "Zhou Qing".</p><p></p><p>Different memories collided in Zhou Qing's mind, leaving him momentarily dazed.</p><p></p><p>"Did I... transmigrate?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing looked at his surroundings, which were completely different from the world he once knew, coupled with the additional memories in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Transmigration was already an obvious fact.</p><p></p><p>[This month's cheat: Heavenly Earth Bank (a place where wealth gathers, after connecting to the Heavenly Earth Bank, you will continuously receive coins)]</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, glowing text appeared in front of Zhou Qing's eyes. He was stunned for a moment but quickly understood the meaning of these words.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the cheat for me as a transmigrator?"</p><p></p><p>A transmigrator must have a cheat, it's a basic operation.</p><p></p><p>After figuring out the function of the Heavenly Earth Bank, Zhou Qing was somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>Without having to pay anything, he could continuously obtain money from this bank.</p><p></p><p>Copper coins, silver, gold...</p><p></p><p>As long as he was still alive, he could get them.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing opened his hand, and ten copper coins appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>This was simply a copy of the rich and powerful system!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing had already foreseen his future luxurious life, just thinking about it made him unable to hold back his laughter.</p><p></p><p>However, what did this "monthly cheat" mean? Could it be that the cheat would change next month?</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing lifted the quilt and fumbled out of bed, but as soon as he stepped on the ground, his legs went soft. If he hadn't grabbed the bed frame in time, he would have probably fallen to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"This body is too weak."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhou Qing felt that his body had been hollowed out, without any strength.</p><p></p><p>Lighting a candle, Zhou Qing looked around the room and then slowly moved to the mirror.</p><p></p><p>A young face appeared in the mirror, in his twenties, but every part of this face revealed unhealthy information.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's eyes were sunken, with heavy dark circles, his eyes were haggard and lifeless, his complexion was as pale as snow, extremely thin, with disheveled hair.</p><p></p><p>If someone said that the person reflected in the mirror was about to die, most people would probably believe it.</p><p></p><p>That memory told Zhou Qing why he had become like this today, because "Zhou Qing"...</p><p></p><p>Encountered a ghost.</p><p></p><p>Wait, encountered what?</p><p></p><p>Fuck, encountered a ghost?</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing suddenly reacted.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing" encountered a ghost, but now he was Zhou Qing, didn't this mean that he had encountered a ghost?</p><p></p><p>"Hoo!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, a cold wind blew in the room, the candlelight flickered, and Zhou Qing looked back and scanned the entire room. Although he didn't find anything, his heart was extremely nervous.</p><p></p><p>In two lifetimes, this was the first time he had encountered such a thing.</p><p></p><p>When he turned his head back, Zhou Qing found that something seemed to have appeared in the mirror.</p><p></p><p>In the flickering candlelight, on the shoulders of Zhou Qing in the mirror, a woman's ghostly face had appeared at some unknown time!</p><p></p><p>There was a cool and itchy sensation around Zhou Qing's neck, and the ghost's hair was slowly wrapping around it inch by inch!</p><p></p><p>This was the thing that Zhou Qing learned from the original's memories, the thing that had been haunting him these past few days, the culprit that had caused Zhou Qing's body to become like this!</p><p></p><p>"Fuck!"</p><p></p><p>Huge fear exploded in his heart, Zhou Qing's heart was almost jumping out, he slapped the mirror away and frantically hit his own shoulders.</p><p></p><p>"Slap!"</p><p></p><p>The mirror fell and the person collapsed, Zhou Qing didn't hit the ghost face, but instead fell due to using too much force, adding insult to injury to his already weak body.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing quickly looked at his left and right shoulders and the entire room, there was nothing, as if everything just now was his own illusion.</p><p></p><p>But Zhou Qing knew.</p><p></p><p>There was a ghost in the room.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing leaned into a corner, staring at the entire room with wide eyes, not daring to relax in the slightest, his eyes were red, and his whole body felt ice-cold, stretched to an extreme.</p><p></p><p>That's right, the cheat, I still have the Heavenly Earth Bank cheat!</p><p></p><p>As soon as Zhou Qing thought of his cheat, his whole person "cracked".</p><p></p><p>Is the Heavenly Earth Bank powerful?</p><p></p><p>But at this time, what use do I have for this Heavenly Earth Bank?</p><p></p><p>"Slap!"</p><p></p><p>One or two silver taels fell out of thin air next to Zhou Qing, the Heavenly Earth Bank was showing its existence.</p><p></p><p>Are you here to make a joke with this cheat?</p><p></p><p>I hate money, I have no interest in money, go away, I want to change to another cheat.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was on the verge of tears, at this time he really wanted to know one thing, that was whether having money could make ghosts turn millstones.</p><p></p><p>He didn't ask for ghosts to turn millstones, he only asked for it to leave.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and the air seemed to have solidified.</p><p></p><p>"Dong! Dong! Dong!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the night watch sounded outside, accompanied by the shouts of the night watchman.</p><p></p><p>"Third watch at midnight, peace and safety!"</p><p></p><p>"Hoo!"</p><p></p><p>As the night watch sounded, cracks appeared in the frozen and cold atmosphere, and Zhou Qing suddenly let out a sigh of relief, gradually feeling warmth throughout his body, as if the evil spirit had been temporarily startled by the night watch.</p><p></p><p>"Midnight? Eleven o'clock?"</p><p></p><p>"No, in this world, the night watch sounds every half hour, and this is already the second time the third watch has sounded, which means it's already midnight."</p><p></p><p>"It's also the seventh day since I encountered the ghost..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing felt a strong unease in his heart, the number seven, in all walks of life, had many meanings, especially in the theory of ghosts and gods, seven was even more unique.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the past, Zhou Qing would have dismissed this as a far-fetched hypothesis, but now that he had personally experienced something unimaginable, it was truly difficult to ignore.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that the night was still long, and while a shout could startle for a moment, it couldn't startle for the entire night.</p><p></p><p>Just then, rows of glowing text suddenly appeared before Zhou Qing's eyes, floating in the air and catching his attention.</p><p></p><p>[Obtained one chance to refresh the golden finger, starting refresh]</p><p></p><p>[Last month's golden finger: Heaven and Earth Money House]</p><p></p><p>[Refreshing...]</p><p></p><p>[Refresh complete]</p><p></p><p>The golden finger actually refreshed? The Heaven and Earth Money House was replaced by the Great Thousand Immortal Tree?</p><p></p><p>Seeing these words, Zhou Qing felt a sense of a turning point.</p><p></p><p>"So this is what the golden finger of this month means. Every month, the golden finger refreshes! Now my golden finger is the game secret realm Great Thousand Immortal Tree!"</p><p></p><p>After roughly understanding some information about the Great Thousand Immortal Tree, Zhou Qing didn't hesitate at all and directly activated his golden finger for this month - [Great Thousand Immortal Tree].</p><p></p><p>Evil ghosts were lurking and could reappear at any time, leaving no room for Zhou Qing to think too much. If he pondered any longer, he might be directly devoured by the ghosts!</p><p></p><p>Light and darkness alternated before his eyes, and Zhou Qing appeared in a dark space with no sky or earth.</p><p></p><p>In front of him was a tree about two people tall.</p><p></p><p>This tree looked ordinary, without any special aura, only its trunk and leaves were enveloped in a hazy glow.</p><p></p><p>Realizing that he had left the haunted house and could no longer feel any chill, Zhou Qing let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Temporarily safe.</p><p></p><p>After escaping, Zhou Qing finally had time to consider everything that had just happened. He had figured out what his golden finger was.</p><p></p><p>His golden finger was... many golden fingers.</p><p></p><p>According to the information provided by those words, his golden finger would refresh every month, with the old one disappearing and a new one appearing.</p><p></p><p>And the time he transmigrated over was April 30th in this world. After that night watch, it was just May 1st, and the golden finger refreshed in time.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven and Earth Money House, after briefly manifesting its existence, was directly replaced by the Great Thousand Immortal Tree.</p><p></p><p>The money house was out of luck!</p><p></p><p>"The first golden finger was actually quite good, but it just had to appear at that time."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was extremely frightened. He had almost died at the hands of the evil ghost. Such an experience was really too thrilling.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, "Zhou Qing" had already died on the night of the sixth day.</p><p></p><p>And the second golden finger that refreshed, [Great Thousand Immortal Tree], was a game secret realm.</p><p></p><p>When using this golden finger, Zhou Qing would come to the [Great Thousand Immortal Tree] secret realm.</p><p></p><p>According to the information that came with the golden finger, there existed an ancient and mysterious Great Thousand Immortal Tree in that secret realm.</p><p></p><p>And Zhou Qing could only do one thing, which was to chop the tree, using a special axe to chop that Great Thousand Immortal Tree.</p><p></p><p>Then, based on Zhou Qing's realm, strength, life essence, and the damage inflicted on it, the Great Thousand Immortal Tree would leak corresponding immortal tree power to form treasures and drop them for Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>If you're strong, the dropped items will be good; if you're weak...</p><p></p><p>This golden finger was very similar to a cultivation game called Seeking the Dao in the Great Thousand that Zhou Qing had played in his previous life, and it was very easy to understand.</p><p></p><p>The tree that appeared before Zhou Qing's eyes at this moment was the Great Thousand Immortal Tree.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing carefully observed this immortal tree, taking in its full appearance, and then Zhou Qing became a little puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Where's the axe? How do I chop it down?</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhou Qing suddenly flew towards the Great Thousand Immortal Tree, and finally felt like he had punctured a layer of membrane.</p><p></p><p>The dark space disappeared, and Zhou Qing appeared in a world with boundless greenery and just the right amount of sunlight.</p><p></p><p>And in front of him was a vast and boundless tree, so tall that he couldn't see the top, and so wide that he couldn't see the sides.</p><p></p><p>This was the true [Great Thousand Immortal Tree] secret realm. Just now, Zhou Qing was still outside the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>"This is too big." </p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing exclaimed in amazement. As expected of an immortal tree, it seemed to have no limit in size.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing walked a distance to the left, and the scenery remained the same. He still couldn't see the end of this immortal tree.</p><p></p><p>And outside the immortal tree, there was also a river. The river was about three meters wide, bottomless, and had no beginning or end.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's position was between the immortal tree and the river.</p><p></p><p>"This is a bit different from the game I played on Earth." Zhou Qing thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Next to the immortal tree was a stone trough, and in the trough was an axe. Zhou Qing picked up the axe, and it looked no different from an ordinary axe.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing opened his personal panel again.</p><p></p><p>This was a game-like secret realm, so of course there would be a data panel.</p><p></p><p>However, if he left this secret realm or the golden finger refreshed again after a month, this data panel would disappear.</p><p></p><p>The data panel only summarized and displayed Zhou Qing's personal information, allowing Zhou Qing to more intuitively understand himself. It had no other use.</p><p></p><p>[Player: Zhou Qing]</p><p></p><p>[Life: Acquired]</p><p></p><p>[Realm: Mortal (Body deficient, Origin greatly damaged, Spirit injured and Soul weakened)]</p><p></p><p>[Stamina: 1/1 (First time chopping the Great Thousand Immortal Tree will receive bonus rewards)]</p><p></p><p>[Items: None]</p><p></p><p>Looking at the information on the panel, Zhou Qing's expression was not very good.</p><p></p><p>Each column of information was easy to understand and didn't require much explanation.</p><p></p><p>But what was displayed in the Realm column was so glaring.</p><p></p><p>Body deficient, Origin greatly damaged, Spirit injured and Soul weakened!</p><p></p><p>In other words: You're about to die!</p><p></p><p>New person, new book, please support everyone.</p><p></p><p>On the first day of the book, three chapters and ten thousand words update are presented.</p>

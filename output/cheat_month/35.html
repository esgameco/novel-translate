            <p>Chapter 35: Gao Family Village</p><p></p><p>"Your name is Zhou Qing, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the 'Zhou' from 'Zhouquan', and the 'Qing' from 'clear water'. {What? You don't know yet | Read COM, chapters without mistakes | Hurry up and google it}"</p><p></p><p>"Which family are you from? There shouldn't be any Zhou family in Heiyun Town, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Miss Yun, I'm not from any prominent family, just an ordinary household."</p><p></p><p>This conversation took place between Zhou Qing and his companion, who had already left Heiyun Town.</p><p></p><p>The matter arranged by Lu Qingmo was not in Heiyun Town, but in a village more than ten miles west of the town.</p><p></p><p>"Oh." Yunduo nodded, a little surprised. </p><p></p><p>"Just call me Yunduo."</p><p></p><p>"Then how did you come to study under the teacher? Many people want to become the teacher's disciple, but the teacher hasn't accepted any."</p><p></p><p>"I am a disciple of Taibai Martial Hall. The martial hall sent me to study beside Aunt Mo."</p><p></p><p>Checking household registration, huh!</p><p></p><p>While explaining, Zhou Qing also guessed Yunduo's background.</p><p></p><p>There was only one family with this surname in Heiyun Town, a major clan.</p><p></p><p>As long as humans exist and can reproduce, it's impossible for any place not to have the presence of family forces, even in a different world.</p><p></p><p>However, the official disciples of the three major martial halls are no worse than those from big families in terms of status and talent.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing looked at Yunduo, she was quite good-looking and lovely, just very ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Truly ordinary, without any curves at all.</p><p></p><p>"A Taibai disciple, no wonder..." Yunduo nodded, then reacted, "You cultivate both martial arts and Taoism?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"You're so amazing."</p><p></p><p>"I'm Yunduo, fifteen years old this year, from the Yun family. I started learning Taoism from the teacher two and a half years ago, and I'm now at the Night Roaming stage." Yunduo asked curiously:</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing, what level are you at?"</p><p></p><p>The Divine Roaming Realm of Taoism is divided into two stages, Night Roaming and Day Roaming. The evil monk Neng Wu is at the Night Roaming stage.</p><p></p><p>And now the young girl beside Zhou Qing was also at this stage.</p><p></p><p>Faced with Yunduo's endless questions, Zhou Qing felt a little helpless. </p><p></p><p>We've only just met for a short while, aren't your questions a bit too much?</p><p></p><p>"I've just started cultivating Soul, still at the Visualization Realm."</p><p></p><p>It's actually proper to inform each other of strength between temporary teammates.</p><p></p><p>"Oh." Yunduo nodded, "It's okay, Soul cultivation progresses very quickly, you don't need to rush."</p><p></p><p>Yunduo cultivated for two and a half years to reach the third realm of Soul, while Bai Ruoyue, the number one martial arts talent in Heiyun Town, cultivated for six years to reach the third realm of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The uniqueness of Soul cultivation was evident.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Soul cultivation can't possibly always be that fast, and if they fought, even several Yunduos tied together wouldn't be a match for Bai Ruoyue.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Yunduo kept asking Zhou Qing all kinds of questions. Zhou Qing had never seen someone who could talk so much.</p><p></p><p>He felt that this Yunduo was a bit dull and not very bright.</p><p></p><p>As for whether she was truly dull or just pretending, Zhou Qing didn't know.</p><p></p><p>Soon the two arrived at their mission location - Gao Family Village.</p><p></p><p>A name that made Zhou Qing want to make sarcastic remarks.</p><p></p><p>This trip to Gao Family Village wouldn't involve encountering pig demons, right?</p><p></p><p>"Yunduo, do you have any plan?" Zhou Qing asked, respecting this senior disciple.</p><p></p><p>After all, she had done several tasks for Lu Qingmo before and must be very experienced.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, me?" Yunduo glanced at Zhou Qing, then looked towards Gao Family Village. After pondering for a while, she said:</p><p></p><p>"I don't know either."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>So you thought for a while and just came up with this sentence?</p><p></p><p>"How did you handle things before when you</p><p></p><p>Sure, here's the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"How do we solve this?" </p><p></p><p>Yunduo honestly replied, "I'll go home and tell my father, and he'll send someone to go with me."</p><p></p><p>Okay, an irrefutable reason.</p><p></p><p>In Zhou Qing's eyes, the halo of an experienced hand on Yunduo faded away, and she became a tender newbie.</p><p></p><p>After the change in thinking, Zhou Qing could also understand.</p><p></p><p>After all, she was only a fifteen-year-old girl, and one couldn't ask for too much.</p><p></p><p>In this world, there were little demons like Yang Xing who committed murder at the age of twelve, and naturally, there would also be silly fifteen-year-old girls.</p><p></p><p>"Let's first go and take a look at those few households, and then go find the village head of Gao Family Village to get a detailed understanding of the big and small things that have happened in Gao Family Village during this period."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>The garrison also sent people to investigate this matter, but they didn't find out much. However, they seemed to have discovered clues related to Taoist magic, so the matter eventually came to the Ghost and God Management Department.</p><p></p><p>According to the garrison's intelligence, Zhou Qing and Yunduo secretly went to the households where people had disappeared, a total of six households.</p><p></p><p>Many things were already recorded in the case files, but the perspective of a Taoist priest was naturally different from that of an ordinary constable.</p><p></p><p>When they went to the fourth household, Zhou Qing and Yunduo made a discovery.</p><p></p><p>The missing person in this family was a child. Under the scrutiny of their spiritual power, they found a few animal hairs in a hidden corner of the child's bed.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be the work of a monster?" Yunduo said.</p><p></p><p>Among the six households, none of them kept animals with such fur, and none of them were engaged in animal husbandry or slaughtering.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing didn't say anything and put away the few strands of hair. He went to the next household, and in the corner of the wall of the sixth household, he made the same discovery again.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of animal hair is this?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing shook his head, "It's not very clear."</p><p></p><p>There were so many animals in the world. Except for chicken feathers, which were too obvious, who dared to say that they could recognize all other animal hairs at a glance?</p><p></p><p>"Let's not go to the village head's house first. Let's look around the village to see if there's anything similar!"</p><p></p><p>Not being in a special environment like underwater, Zhou Qing's spiritual coverage could be said to have multiplied many times, and it wouldn't take long to search the entire village.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the same animal hairs were found in some corners of Gao Family Village. Following the trail, they discovered that these hairs ultimately pointed to the south of the village.</p><p></p><p>"They went south?"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, while searching the village, Zhou Qing and the others also found out what kind of animal the hairs belonged to.</p><p></p><p>It was donkey hair. There were people in Gao Family Village who kept donkeys, and when compared, it was more than obvious.</p><p></p><p>But the donkey hair that Zhou Qing and the others found was not the same color as those of the donkeys being raised.</p><p></p><p>Taking Yunduo with him, they went to the village head's house. During this process, Yunduo obediently followed behind Zhou Qing, doing whatever he said.</p><p></p><p>"Village Head Gao, you said in your report to the officials that an itinerant Taoist priest came to Gao Family Village some time ago?" Zhou Qing asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that Taoist priest rested in our Gao Family Village for a while, asked for a bowl of water to drink, and then left."</p><p></p><p>Village Head Gao said, "But not long after he left, people started disappearing from the village."</p><p></p><p>"What's to the south of Gao Family Village? Where can you go from there?"</p><p></p><p>"To the south... There's a tea pavilion there, and further south is Niu Family Village."</p><p></p><p>"Do people from the village drive donkeys to the south?"</p><p></p><p>"Sometimes they do. A few days ago, someone came to the village to buy a few donkeys and then went south."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing asked Village Head Gao a few more detailed questions, then took Yunduo and left, heading straight south.</p><p></p><p>Soon the tea pavilion was in sight, and at the same time, more than a dozen tied-up donkeys also entered Zhou Qing's view.</p><p></p><p>Searching for donkeys by their hair, this time the colors matched!</p>

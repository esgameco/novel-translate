        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 6: The Popular Section</p><p></p><p>In Black Cloud Town, there are generally only three paths to go further on the martial path.</p><p></p><p>The first is to join a martial arts school to learn, break through step by step, and finally be favored by the school masters.</p><p></p><p>The second is to try to join the government after entering the realm of flesh and blood, and see if you can pass the government assessment to become an official martial artist.</p><p></p><p>The last is to enter one of the major families in Black Cloud Town, where there are also many martial arts masters.</p><p></p><p>However, the threshold for government martial artists is the highest, while family martial artists have too many restrictions, almost like selling oneself.</p><p></p><p>Those major families have trained you, and they will not let you leave easily.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, martial arts schools are the best choice for most people, and also Zhou Qing's choice.</p><p></p><p>As for self-taught success...</p><p></p><p>I can only give you two words: good luck.</p><p></p><p>After understanding Zhou Qing's situation clearly, Bai Tian already had plans in his mind.</p><p></p><p>At this time, two more people walked in, a young man and an old man.</p><p></p><p>"School Master Bai is busy with affairs, so I won't disturb you too much. I happen to be going to the other two martial arts schools as well." The young man Meng Hao said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Then I won't keep Young Master Meng either." Bai Tian nodded, "Please rest assured, Young Master Meng, I will not be absent from the trip to Black Mountain."</p><p></p><p>The smile on Meng Hao's face became even more brilliant, "That would naturally be the best."</p><p></p><p>As Meng Hao was about to leave with the old man, his gaze swept over and he stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Hao pointed to a registration certificate on the table in the room and said, </p><p></p><p>"Mu Bo, isn't this address the place from last night?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Bo glanced at the certificate, "Young Master, you are correct."</p><p></p><p>"Is there a problem with this address?" Bai Tian asked in puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>"It's not really a problem, it's just that last night when I was wandering around the town, I sensed yin energy suddenly appearing at this location." Meng Hao shook his head and said,</p><p></p><p>"But before I could get close, the yin energy disappeared. Judging from the intensity of the yin energy, it was probably a small ghost."</p><p></p><p>"Is the owner of that residence also a disciple of your esteemed martial arts school?"</p><p></p><p>"He just joined the school today, and his talent is not bad. I plan to take him as my disciple." Bai Tian nodded.</p><p></p><p>"He just joined the school today?" Meng Hao became interested, "So he is still a mortal now?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, how did a mortal survive in the face of a ghost?" Meng Hao thought for a moment, didn't say anything more, and left directly with Mu Bo.</p><p></p><p>However, after leaving the martial arts school, Mu Bo suddenly said to Meng Hao,</p><p></p><p>"There is a mortal in the backyard of Taibai Martial Arts School. His physical body is not bad, and his spirit is full, but he has indeed not undergone any cultivation, and there are no magic weapons, talismans or other items on his body."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Meng Hao smiled helplessly, "Mu Bo, try to do less of this kind of thing in the future, it's not very polite."</p><p></p><p>"But it is indeed a bit interesting. How did a mortal deal with a ghost without relying on any external objects?"</p><p></p><p>"Mu Bo, you didn't sense anything else at that residence last night, right?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Bo shook his head, "No, there was nothing related to Taoism."</p><p></p><p>"And Young Master, even if there were magic weapons, mortals would not be able to use them."</p><p></p><p>Meng Hao thought for a while, but couldn't come up with any results. He shook his head with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind, I'm just here to have some fun, it has nothing to do with me."</p><p></p><p>The old and young men left along the street. On the third floor of the martial arts school, Zhang Yuantao came to Bai Tian's side from the window.</p><p></p><p>"Master, those two guests have left."</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian nodded, "I will go to Black Mountain with them in three days, you all watch the school."</p><p></p><p>Outside Black Cloud Town, there are continuous mountain ranges, with the tallest peak being called Black Mountain.</p><p></p><p>There is also a mighty river called Cloud River. The name Black Cloud Town is a combination of this mountain and river.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely because of the existence of this mountain and river that the prosperity of Black Cloud Town is no worse than some small cities.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yuantao naturally could not object to Bai Tian's decision. After agreeing, he brought up another matter.</p><p></p><p>"Master, that Zhou Qing..."</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian pondered. As the master of a school, he had also wandered outside for many years when he was young, so he naturally knew about yin energy, ghosts and other things.</p><p></p><p>Meng Hao's doubts were also his doubts.</p><p></p><p>He originally thought he had investigated it clearly, but now it seems that this prospective disciple is not as simple as imagined.</p><p></p><p>"You go down first." Bai Tian said.</p><p></p><p>In the backyard, Zhou Qing had already learned a lot of martial arts knowledge from Bai Ruoyue.</p><p></p><p>During the teaching process, Zhou Qing repeatedly brought surprises to Bai Ruoyue.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing learned too quickly, and his thinking was...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Wei's incomparable agility and ability to draw inferences from one instance was nothing out of the ordinary; no problem could hinder Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was also satisfied with his performance.</p><p></p><p>He roughly guessed why he had undergone such a drastic change. First, it was due to the source of life.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, it should be the help brought to Zhou Qing by entering the sensing period.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue sighed, "Zhou Qing, you are truly a genius."</p><p></p><p>"A genius who hasn't grown up is not worth mentioning." Zhou Qing smiled.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue glanced at Zhou Qing, feeling that he was sometimes too rational.</p><p></p><p>Normally, when an ordinary person suddenly learns that they are a genius, they should usually feel a bit complacent.</p><p></p><p>But although Zhou Qing also appeared happy, he was also very sober-minded.</p><p></p><p>It was quite strange.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue only thought that Zhou Qing was an ordinary person; how could she imagine his bizarre experience?</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue looked at the sky outside, wondering why her father, the hall master, had not yet appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Let's stop here for today, it's almost time for dinner." Bai Ruoyue said,</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing, stay and have dinner at the martial arts hall today."</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts hall also provides meals?"</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary food is still provided, but only for one meal." Bai Ruoyue put away the books, "Later, you come with me and eat with us."</p><p></p><p>"This isn't very appropriate. After all, I'm not a disciple of the hall master." Zhou Qing said, a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>But in his heart, he was very much looking forward to eating the food of martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Mainly because he didn't have much money left...</p><p></p><p>It's just that faced with this situation, Zhou Qing still habitually declined politely. After all, this was a habit cultivated in his previous life...</p><p></p><p>This wasn't hypocrisy, but genuine politeness.</p><p></p><p>If someone gives you a red envelope, of course you have to decline a few times.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, one more person won't eat much." Bai Ruoyue indeed didn't give up. Zhou Qing then smiled and agreed.</p><p></p><p>"There's nothing to do now, you can walk around." </p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue wanted to go find her father and ask about the situation.</p><p></p><p>The two parted ways, and Zhou Qing returned to the arena on the first floor.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhou Qing return, some people immediately surrounded him, chattering.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, have you been accepted as a disciple by the hall master?"</p><p></p><p>"No way, I heard Li Wu say that he's already twenty-two years old. How could the hall master accept a disciple at this age?"</p><p></p><p>"Exactly, maybe he did something wrong and was called in for questioning."</p><p></p><p>With many people come many opinions. Some were simply curious, some envious, and some even slandered Zhou Qing out of jealousy.</p><p></p><p>There were even those who darkly speculated that Zhou Qing might have been noticed by Bai Ruoyue and called in to be toyed with for a while. After all, this guy looked like a pretty boy at first glance.</p><p></p><p>Of course, no one dared to say such thoughts out loud in the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>"I have not been accepted as a disciple by the hall master." Zhou Qing explained, then didn't say more.</p><p></p><p>But just this one sentence made some people excited.</p><p></p><p>"I told you, a twenty-two-year-old apprentice, what qualifications does he have to be accepted as a disciple by the hall master?"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, what are you pretending for? Those who don't know might think your talent is very good."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you're called Zhou Qing, right? Do you have the guts to compare with me? I'm also considered a senior student, let me give you some pointers."</p><p></p><p>Since Zhou Qing was not a disciple of the hall master, his status was no different from theirs.</p><p></p><p>Then of course they weren't afraid of anything. They could say whatever they wanted, and some even wanted to make a move against Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>Inside the martial arts hall, sparring with each other was allowed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the expressions of these people, Zhou Qing actually felt amused.</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the Taibai Martial Arts Hall gave a good impression, but these apprentices were a mixed bag.</p><p></p><p>When accepting apprentices, they didn't look at character, only at yuan.</p><p></p><p>Everything had finally come to a familiar part for Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing swept his eyes over the few people around him who were speaking arrogantly. After eliminating a few who were younger, looking only twelve or thirteen years old, he pointed at a few of them.</p><p></p><p>"You, you, you, and you. Some of you said you wanted to spar with me, while others looked at me with a displeased expression."</p><p></p><p>"Come, I'll give you this opportunity. I'll practice with you guys."</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned by Zhou Qing's words. Even those who were originally bitterly training in the corner and had no interest in Zhou Qing couldn't help but look over here.</p><p></p><p>The few hall master's disciples patrolling here were also alerted.</p><p></p><p>"What are you looking at? I'm talking about you few." Zhou Qing was quite arrogant and didn't take these few senior apprentices who had been practicing martial arts for a while seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have the habit of playing pig, nor the mindset to smile while being mocked and ridiculed.</p><p></p><p>He didn't transmigrate here to suffer these people's temper!</p><p></p><p>If he had to suffer without transmigrating, and still had to suffer after transmigrating and gaining a cheat, then damn it, didn't he transmigrate for nothing?</p>

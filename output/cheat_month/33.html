            <p>Chapter 33: Chaos</p><p></p><p>"How long have you known each other?"</p><p></p><p>"Seven days."</p><p></p><p>"You've already developed to this stage in just seven days?!"</p><p></p><p>"Because of our deep bond."</p><p></p><p>"What? You already have a child?!!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Shen Yu punched the burly man, "Bro, what nonsense are you talking about, this is our junior disciple!"</p><p></p><p>"Junior disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing also learned the identity of this man, the second disciple during the day, Shen Yu's biological elder brother, one of the only two Viscera Realm warriors among the disciples:</p><p></p><p>Shen Long.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Second Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>Shen Long's expression eased slightly. Since he was a junior disciple, he wasn't an outsider.</p><p></p><p>But even if he was a junior disciple, he couldn't be messing around with his sister!</p><p></p><p>"Since the master accepted you as a disciple, your talent must be quite good." Shen Long scrutinized Zhou Qing. He had already noticed that Zhou Qing was older, but he didn't mention this point.</p><p></p><p>"But talent alone is not enough. After we return, let's spar a bit, the two of us."</p><p></p><p>"If you're too weak, I'll train you well later on!"</p><p></p><p>How could such words come out of the mouth of a Viscera Realm warrior like you?</p><p></p><p>"Bro, stop messing around. Junior Brother has only been practicing martial arts for seven days!" Shen Yu punched her elder brother again.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, don't take my brother's words to heart. He's just like this, always likes to fight with people."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing forced a smile. I think he doesn't like fighting, but likes beating me up.</p><p></p><p>"Were you hunting Aqua Monsters?" Shen Long glanced at the two monster corpses on the ground. </p><p></p><p>"You're quite bold, daring to mess around underwater."</p><p></p><p>Speaking of this, Shen Yu perked up and started telling Shen Long how amazing Zhou Qing was.</p><p></p><p>"He has such talent too?" Shen Long was surprised. This junior brother he just met was quite extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Bro, are you heading back to Black Cloud Town?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go back together. Help Junior Brother store away his spoils."</p><p></p><p>Shen Long took out a brocade pouch from his waist, opened it, and the two monster corpses on the ground were directly sucked into it.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's eyes lit up. Was this a spatial equipment? </p><p></p><p>"This is a spatial pouch, but we all call it the Taibai Pouch. It's small and cute, right?"</p><p></p><p>"It has quite a large space inside and can be used to store items. It's very amazing."</p><p></p><p>"My brother was rewarded this by the master when he broke through to the Viscera Realm. We'll have one in the future too!"</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed amazing."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing nodded. Although he was sick of hearing about such things, seeing it with his own eyes gave a different feeling.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he hoped the Great Thousand Spirit Tree would hurry up and drop a spatial equipment for him too, and not be ungrateful.</p><p></p><p>The Aqua Bead fragments had entered cooldown. Going back underwater would just be feeding the Aqua Monsters. The three of them left directly.</p><p></p><p>"Half a day to enter the realm, seven days to gain initial mastery, great mastery of strength?!!"</p><p></p><p>After learning about some of Zhou Qing's deeds from his sister, Shen Long was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Impressive, truly impressive." Shen Long patted Zhou Qing's shoulder in admiration, then became a bit excited.</p><p></p><p>"No, Junior Brother, you must have a match with me and let me experience the strength of a genius like you."</p><p></p><p>"What? That little brat Yang Xing dared to attack Junior Brother? That bastard Long Yun dared to come to our door looking for trouble?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Long was furious. "When I get back, I'll go to Soaring Dragon Martial Hall and spar with Long Yun. He dares to bully people from our Taibai Martial Hall!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Long kept making a fuss the whole way. Zhou Qing roughly understood what kind of person his Second Senior Brother was.</p><p></p><p>Belligerent, reckless...</p><p></p><p>In short, he was a pure martial brute.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Third Senior Brother Zhang Yuantao managed Taibai Martial Hall on normal days.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the martial hall, Shen Long took out many monster corpses from his Taibai Pouch, including those from the first three martial realms. He placed them in the...</p><p></p><p>After serving as food for Zhou Qing and the others, some special parts could even be made into weapons, which were very valuable.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he took out several spiritual plants and gave them to Bai Ruoyue to distribute among his junior brothers. As he was already at the Viscera Realm, ordinary spiritual plants were of little use to him.</p><p></p><p>"Second Senior Brother, you've gained quite a lot from spending half a month in the Black Mountain this time," Zhang Yuantao said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"It's just so-so," Shen Long said with some regret, "I did discover some really good things, but I couldn't get them at all."</p><p></p><p>"What did you find?" Bai Ruoyue asked.</p><p></p><p>"A Bone-Grinding Flower, which had already borne fruit."</p><p></p><p>"Bone-Grinding Flower?" Bai Ruoyue's face lit up with joy.</p><p></p><p>"The Bone-Grinding Flower is a spiritual plant that can help cultivators temper their bones," Shen Yu quietly explained to Zhou Qing,</p><p></p><p>"Big Senior Sister and my brother are both at the Viscera Realm. The next step is to refine their bones, so this Bone-Grinding Flower is very useful to them."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the fruit of the Bone-Grinding Flower can be said to be one of the best medicines for tempering tendons and veins."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing understood that it was related to cultivation after the Viscera Realm.</p><p></p><p>"With my strength, dealing with a Bone-Refining Fierce Beast is not a problem..." Bai Ruoyue was pondering. She wanted this Bone-Grinding Flower.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there would definitely be a share for Shen Long as well.</p><p></p><p>"Please ask Master to take action. The Black Mountain has been unstable recently, so it's not very safe for us to go in."</p><p></p><p>"My father also entered the Black Mountain a few days ago. I don't know when he will come back."</p><p></p><p>"Master also went into the Black Mountain?" Shen Long shook his head, "Then there's nothing we can do. We can't go to the Black Mountain for a while."</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened inside?"</p><p></p><p>"It's chaotic, too chaotic. Many savage beasts that should have stayed in their lairs are out and about, and there are also demons and ghosts showing their traces. Many cultivators have died."</p><p></p><p>Shen Long seemed a little frightened, "I encountered a demon from a distance. Just one glance at me made my heart tremble with fear, and I ran away directly, not daring to look a second time."</p><p></p><p>"Originally, I wasn't planning to come out, but the abnormality in the Black Mountain made me not dare to stay long."</p><p></p><p>Demons!</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue and Zhou Qing had mentioned such existences.</p><p></p><p>They were also beasts, but unlike the brutal and chaotic savage beasts, demons were all intelligent, incredibly clever, and could even transform into human form.</p><p></p><p>The foxes and white snakes in stories like "The Fox at the Door" and "The White Snake's Gratitude" were demons.</p><p></p><p>After hearing Shen Long's account, Bai Ruoyue could only give up the idea of entering the Black Mountain.</p><p></p><p>As for Zhou Qing, he secretly felt that something was wrong. Bai Tian had entered the Black Mountain during the day, and as a result, the Black Mountain had become chaotic.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that something had happened to his master?</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, after tempering in the Black Mountain for half a month this time, I feel that I have made progress again!"</p><p></p><p>"Come, let's have a match!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Long smoothly changed the topic and looked at Bai Ruoyue with fierce fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue rolled her eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I suddenly remembered that there are still some matters to deal with at the martial arts hall, so I'll leave first." Zhang Yuantao directly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Su Chang'an left without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>"I have to go check on those disciples." He Fengling pulled Zhou Qing before leaving.</p><p></p><p>"Little Junior Brother, shall we go together?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah? Okay, okay."</p><p></p><p>Soon everyone left, leaving only the Shen siblings and Bai Ruoyue.</p><p></p><p>"Fifth Junior Brother, Second Senior Brother is no match for Big Senior Sister, right?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue was publicly recognized as the number one among the younger generation in Heiyun Town. Although Shen Long was several years older than Bai Ruoyue, he also belonged to the same generation.</p><p></p><p>"Of course he's no match for Big Senior Sister," He Feng smiled helplessly, "But Second Senior Brother just has this personality."</p><p></p><p>"If we don't leave now, after he finishes fighting with Big Senior Sister, he will come to fight with us."</p><p></p><p>"If Master were here, he would even want to fight with Master."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>It indeed matched his impression of Second Senior Brother.</p><p></p><p>Built an extras building in the comment section</p>

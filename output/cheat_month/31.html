            <p>Chapter 31: Look for Your Own Reasons More</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingmo's gaze shifted from the gorgeous peach blossoms to Zhou Qing. {What? You don't know yet | Read COM, chapters without errors | Hurry and google it}</p><p></p><p>Hmm?</p><p></p><p>With a flash in her bright eyes, Lu Qingmo saw something.</p><p></p><p>"Your martial arts... have broken through?"</p><p></p><p>"I had some accidental gains last night and was lucky to break through." Zhou Qing was very humble.</p><p></p><p>"You've only been practicing martial arts for seven days, right?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingmo gave Zhou Qing a deep look. Martial arts cultivation relies on accumulation and bitter practice. There's no such thing as luck when it comes to breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>In a place like Heiyun Town, there aren't many resources, at most a few low-grade spirit plants. Being able to break through to the early stage of the Flesh Realm after practicing for seven days shook Lu Qingmo to the core. </p><p></p><p>Relying solely on bitter practice to reach this level, Lu Qingmo had never seen such a genius before. Only those legendary figures were said to have such accomplishments when they were young.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingmo never imagined that this Zhou Qing... would be so heaven-defying?</p><p></p><p>This kind of talent is coveted by all the major martial arts sects in the world!</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed around seven days."</p><p></p><p>What's so difficult about breaking through in seven days?</p><p></p><p>Sometimes you have to look more for your own reasons. Over the years, has your cultivation speed increased? Have you been diligently practicing on a daily basis?</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Bai Tian was willing to come find me for you during the day. Your martial arts talent is indeed extraordinary. Even in the broader domains, it is not inferior to others."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingmo said, "But since your martial arts talent is amazing, you can cultivate magic arts as a supplement, but you must distinguish the priorities."</p><p></p><p>After Zhou Qing gave her some shock, Lu Qingmo didn't let Zhou Qing give up on magic arts.</p><p></p><p>Since he has talent in magic arts, it shouldn't be wasted.</p><p></p><p>Dual cultivation is always better than single cultivation, as long as you pay attention to the balance.</p><p></p><p>"Come with me."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingmo turned around and Zhou Qing quickly followed.</p><p></p><p>As Zhou Qing got closer, a faint fragrance wafted into Lu Qingmo's nose.</p><p></p><p>She subconsciously sniffed and then looked at Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Lu, what's the matter?" Zhou Qing was puzzled. What are you looking at?</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing." Lu Qingmo shook her head, feeling a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>You're a grown man, how come you have... body fragrance?</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingmo didn't take Zhou Qing into the attic, but conducted the lesson outdoors.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual cultivation is different from the physical body. It is mysterious and unpredictable. You will often encounter some strange tribulations - the calamity of losing your way, the tribulation of soul projection, damage from the sun and moon, and even the descent of heavenly demons are all possible."</p><p></p><p>"Since you have embarked on this path, you must be prepared. Do not be afraid of difficulties. You need to have great courage and determination in your heart at all times in order to overcome all tribulations."</p><p></p><p>Right from the start, Lu Qingmo poured cold water on Zhou Qing, telling him about the many disadvantages and dangers of spiritual magic arts.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was not scared, but listened attentively to every word of "Teacher" Lu.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation is dangerous? Weak combat power in the early stages? What does that have to do with me?</p><p></p><p>A real man should overcome all obstacles in front of him!</p><p></p><p>I've never closed my eyes!</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingmo was very satisfied with Zhou Qing's reaction.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, how long did it take you to sense the Spirit Homeland?" Lu Qingmo asked.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's heart stirred. From the sound of it, Lu Qingmo's master didn't tell her these things?</p><p></p><p>This is quite respectful of one's privacy...</p><p></p><p>But what exactly is the relationship between Bai Tian and her? She can come to her for visualization charts, but doesn't explain everything.</p><p></p><p>It seems like they have a good relationship, but also not so good. It's very strange.</p><p></p><p>"Just a few breaths." Zhou Qing answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>"?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingmo frowned slightly, "A few breaths?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Zhou Qing said, "Seven days ago, I was haunted by a ghost. After the ghost died, when I was in a daze and relaxed, I sensed the Spirit Homeland."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingmo was silent for a moment. His martial arts talent was already at the peak, could it be that he's also a magic arts genius?</p><p></p><p>"Your spirit is innately strong, at least not inferior to a Sensing Stage quasi-cultivator." Lu Qingmo asked again,</p><p></p><p>"Being haunted by a ghost, you must have been harmed by it?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that ghost haunted me for six days. At that time, I felt so weak that I was about to die."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's main approach was to be honest.</p><p></p><p>"After fundamental damage to the spirit and body, you were still able to automatically sense the Spirit Homeland. If it's the origin..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Without any damage, he began to cultivate...</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingmo didn't know what to say, feeling a bit regretful and unsettled.</p><p></p><p>She really felt that Zhou Qing had opened her eyes today.</p><p></p><p>Originally, she didn't pay attention to the new disciple received during the day, thinking he was at the same level as the previous few disciples. She didn't even have a good impression of him during the day.</p><p></p><p>She simply didn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>However, after interacting with Zhou Qing today, Lu Qingmo discovered that she had miscalculated.</p><p></p><p>The young man in front of her brought her a huge impact that made it difficult for her to remain calm.</p><p></p><p>Could there really be a true dragon among the grassroots?</p><p></p><p>Such a person shouldn't appear in Heiyun Town, but should appear in the world's great martial arts sects or legendary schools!</p><p></p><p>For such a person, it was simply foreseeable that he would surpass her in the future.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing felt strange in his heart. Why did Lu Qingmo's words sound so familiar...</p><p></p><p>Just how strong was Zhou Qing's innate talent with his original source undamaged? </p><p></p><p>Well, it was "strong" beyond your imagination.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing, even if your innate talent in Taoism is not as good as your innate talent in martial arts, you are still a Taoist prodigy." Lu Qingmo said, </p><p></p><p>"I hope you don't waste your talent."</p><p></p><p>"Also, in the future... don't call me senior anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Ah? Then what should I call you?"</p><p></p><p>"Just like Ruoyue."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Aunt Mo!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing asked a question, "Aunt Mo, that night Neng Wuhun wanted to fly away, but his physical body was still left in Shanshui Temple. Without his physical body, can his soul still exist?"</p><p></p><p>That night, when Zhou Qing and the others searched Shanshui Temple afterwards, they found Neng Wu's physical body, but without his soul, it was just an empty shell.</p><p></p><p>"With his Divine Wandering realm cultivation, his soul must rely on his physical body to exist. After escaping, he will definitely go to possess an ordinary person." Lu Qingmo explained to Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was shocked in his heart. Possession, he knew about this. Soul cultivation was indeed more strange than physical cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Visualization realm cultivators die in both body and soul. Projection realm cultivators' souls can exist briefly after the death of their physical bodies."</p><p></p><p>"But it's difficult for Projection realm cultivators to have the opportunity to possess others. Their souls can't leave their bodies too far, unless prepared in advance."</p><p></p><p>"Divine Wandering realm cultivators are different. So, in the future, when you fight against cultivators, be sure not to overlook their souls."</p><p></p><p>After imparting some more tips to Zhou Qing, Lu Qingmo took out a few books and began to formally teach Zhou Qing. Her attitude had already changed unconsciously.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing continuously absorbed knowledge about souls and Taoism from Lu Qingmo, and also understood some previously obscure professional terms.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour passed quickly, and the teaching time ended. Lu Qingmo handed the "textbooks" to Zhou Qing and told him to read them when he went back.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing thanked Lu Qingmo and prepared to leave.</p><p></p><p>"With your talent, it won't take long to perfect the Visualization realm. Be careful of the calamity of losing yourself." Lu Qingmo reminded.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing nodded. His visualization speed was indeed very fast. Most of the Great Thousand Immortal Tree in his soul realm had become clear and spirited, no different from the real one.</p><p></p><p>This was not an isolated case for Zhou Qing, but a common phenomenon in Taoist cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingmo had said during her teaching just now that although it was difficult for cultivators to defeat martial artists head-on in the early stages, in terms of cultivation speed, cultivators in the early stages were far faster than martial artists.</p><p></p><p>This was due to the different natures of souls and physical bodies, as well as the different cultivation methods of the two.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Zhou Qing's visualization speed was also very fast among cultivators.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, this comparison of cultivation speeds only counted as a general situation, not including some particularly stupid cultivators or some particularly heaven-defying martial artists.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou Qing had not yet encountered the calamity of losing himself, which showed the power of the Great Thousand Immortal Tree.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the martial arts hall, Zhou Qing immediately sought out Bai Ruoyue.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, come and take a look at me."</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue glanced at Zhou Qing, knowing what he meant.</p><p></p><p>"I know you've made progress again, Junior Brother. I'm used to it."</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue said, </p><p></p><p>"Hey, Junior Brother, why do you smell so nice? What did you apply..."</p><p></p><p>"Hiss, Junior Brother, you've broken through?" Bai Ruoyue suddenly gasped.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing also gasped.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, lighter, lighter."</p><p></p><p>"It's going to break!"</p>

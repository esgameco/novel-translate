            <p>Chapter 32: The Slumbering Beast Within the Body Has Awakened</p><p></p><p>"He actually broke through."</p><p></p><p>"Such a robust physique."</p><p></p><p>"Little junior brother, you're too fast."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Several senior brothers and sisters surrounded Zhou Qing, pinching and touching him while expressing all kinds of sighs.</p><p></p><p>Achieving minor success in seven days, such a feat left them all dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Little junior brother has not only broken through in realm, his physique and inner breath can at least be compared to the peak of the Flesh Realm." Zhang Yuantao exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>"In other words, little junior brother has attained the strength of the peak Flesh Realm after practicing martial arts for seven days."</p><p></p><p>Yang Xing from the Soaring Dragon Martial Hall has been cultivating for four years and has only now reached the peak of the Flesh Realm!</p><p></p><p>In Black Cloud Town, this was already considered to be top-notch talent.</p><p></p><p>Comparing seven days to four years, the shock it brought to Zhang Yuantao and the others was earth-shattering.</p><p></p><p>"Looking at little junior brother's cultivation speed, I'm afraid his strength will quickly catch up to ours." He Feng laughed, </p><p></p><p>"Being a senior brother really puts on a lot of pressure. Looks like we need to work harder."</p><p></p><p>"Even if he ate spiritual plants every day and high-level monster beast meat every meal, practicing secret martial arts, he shouldn't be able to break through in seven days." </p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue was the most impacted and was very puzzled at the moment.</p><p></p><p>As for Bai Ruoyue's doubts, Zhou Qing could testify that it was indeed like this.</p><p></p><p>He ate spiritual plants almost every day, but before obtaining the Nine Aperture Golden Pill, he was still some distance away from breaking through.</p><p></p><p>Relying on spiritual plants alone, it was indeed impossible to break through in seven days.</p><p></p><p>But Zhou Qing had no way to explain this issue to Bai Ruoyue, so it could only be attributed to...</p><p></p><p>"Maybe I have extraordinary talent."</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue glared at Zhou Qing, "Are you saying that as the eldest senior sister, my talent is not good?"</p><p></p><p>"Look, I just said a few more words and junior sister is already like this. Forget it, forget it, I spoke too much." Zhou Qing shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue raised her fist, "Are you looking for a beating?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone laughed and joked, the atmosphere was very lively.</p><p></p><p>Having a junior brother with outstanding talent was naturally something to be happy about. The relationship between martial siblings was very close, especially when the White Sky was still alive.</p><p></p><p>After completing today's martial arts lessons, Zhou Qing took his sixth senior sister Shen Yu and ran out, leaving Black Cloud Town and arriving at the side of the Cloud River.</p><p></p><p>"Little junior brother, can you really move freely underwater?" Shen Yu asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, sixth senior sister will see in a moment."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing quietly equipped the Aqua Avoidance Pearl fragment.</p><p></p><p>But Zhou Qing was different, the Aqua Avoidance Pearl fragment allowed him to move as if walking on flat ground at the bottom of the water.</p><p></p><p>This virgin territory at the bottom of the water, rarely developed and inaccessible to other martial artists, Zhou Qing could fully explore.</p><p></p><p>With such a unique advantage, Zhou Qing naturally couldn't abandon it. Zhou Qing planned to come to the Cloud River every day in the future, as long as it didn't affect his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Shen Yu was a bit interested in this, so she followed Zhou Qing over to take a look, and also had the intention of looking after Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>What if he gets robbed again...</p><p></p><p>It was embarrassing to say, but Shen Yu was the youngest among the martial siblings, only sixteen years old, and yet Zhou Qing still needed this sixteen-year-old senior sister to look after him.</p><p></p><p>"Sixth senior sister, just stay here and don't move. I'll be right back."</p><p></p><p>With that said, Zhou Qing jumped into the river with a splash, then poked his body out and showed Shen Yu his dry clothes.</p><p></p><p>The dry Zhou Qing left Shen Yu so surprised that she couldn't close her mouth.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, seeing that Zhou Qing hadn't come up for a long time, Shen Yu became a bit worried.</p><p></p><p>It's said that those who drown are good swimmers. Little junior brother is too good at this, could there be a problem?</p><p></p><p>While Zhou Qing had already dived a great distance, constantly observing his surroundings, not missing any place that might have spiritual plants growing.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Zhou Qing was also very vigilant, guarding against any aquatic monsters that might appear.</p><p></p><p>The existence of aquatic monsters at the bottom of the Cloud River was precisely the reason why Zhou Qing decided to enter the Cloud River again only after his cultivation had broken through.</p><p></p><p>The risk of operating at the bottom of the Cloud River was still too great for someone who had just entered the Flesh Realm. The Black Profound Snake from last time was only equivalent to the early Flesh Realm.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual power spread out, revealing everything within a hundred meters in fine detail, making it convenient for Zhou Qing to search.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Search.</p><p></p><p>Even with the water-repelling pearl, Zhou Qing's mental strength was still suppressed in this environment.</p><p></p><p>The dark depths of the river were like a ghostly realm, seeming to conceal endless monsters.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Zhou Qing's spiritual sense detected a trace of abnormal fluctuations, and the elemental qi of heaven and earth was rich.</p><p></p><p>With a boost in spirit, Zhou Qing swam in that direction.</p><p></p><p>A glowing, coral-like plant appeared before Zhou Qing's eyes, but next to the coral, there was also a one-meter long strange fish with dense teeth in its mouth guarding it.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's arrival startled the strange fish. Without any hesitation, the strange fish directly charged at Zhou Qing, wanting to devour him.</p><p></p><p>When his spiritual power came into contact with the strange fish, sensing the elemental qi and strength contained in its flesh and blood, Zhou Qing roughly judged the strength of this strange fish.</p><p></p><p>Skin and flesh greatly accomplished!</p><p></p><p>But the water-repelling pearl fragments gave Zhou Qing the qualifications to fight the strange fish!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing immediately armed himself fully. Seeing the strange fish that was already close to him, a trace of excitement flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Just broke through, and using you to practice!</p><p></p><p>Swimming agilely forward, Zhou Qing did not dodge, directly colliding head-on with the strange fish. The two collided, stirring up the water.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing grabbed the strange fish's fins and punched it non-stop. The strange fish became extremely frenzied, attacking Zhou Qing madly, but Zhou Qing just wouldn't let go.</p><p></p><p>Punch after punch landing on flesh, this feeling was too exhilarating. It seemed like there was a bull demon reviving inside his body.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing felt his blood boiling. The medicinal power of the Nine Apertures Golden Core in his heart increased its output, making Zhou Qing become more and more valiant in battle.</p><p></p><p>He even more thoroughly refined the medicinal power of the Nine Apertures Golden Core, tempering it into his flesh and inner qi, becoming stronger in battle!</p><p></p><p>At one point, the strange fish's fins couldn't withstand the burden and were directly torn off by Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>The strange fish kept spitting out bubbles and turned to flee. Zhou Qing chased closely. This time he used the Eagle Beak Spear shaft, further increasing his attack power. The strange fish hadn't run far before being beaten to death by Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's flesh was fiery hot, his blood boiling, the golden core medicinal power surging out and circulating throughout his body.</p><p></p><p>The injuries the strange fish inflicted on Zhou Qing during the previous battle were recovering at a visible speed under the golden core medicinal power. In this process, his flesh was also strengthened accordingly.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing discovered another effect of the Nine Apertures Golden Core. Not only could it help him cultivate, it could also indirectly help him fight!</p><p></p><p>Dragging the strange fish and picking the spirit coral, Zhou Qing swam towards the surface to send up his spoils of war.</p><p></p><p>"Splash!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing surfaced. Shen Yu hurriedly ran over. "Junior Brother, are you alright?"</p><p></p><p>What Liu Liu Mei.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing placed the strange fish corpse and spirit coral on the shore. "Sixth Senior Sister, I'm preparing to go down again. I'll leave these two things in your care."</p><p></p><p>With that said, Zhou Qing dived down again, leaving Shen Yu standing there dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Why does it feel like Junior Brother going into the water is like going home?</p><p></p><p>However, this time Zhou Qing didn't find any spirit plants underwater. Halfway, he encountered a water savage beast. The savage beast had no spiritual intelligence and was most stubborn, attacking on sight.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing had no choice but to send it off, but the water-repelling pearl fragments were about to lose effect, so he could only leave first, but was still a bit slow.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing got wet.</p><p></p><p>On the shore, Shen Yu helped wring out the water from Zhou Qing's clothes while clicking her tongue in wonder.</p><p></p><p>"In broad daylight, what are you doing?!!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice filled with anger.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was stunned. Could it be that he encountered robbers again?</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing turned his head and saw a burly man with a rather overbearing appearance quickly run to Shen Yu's side, grabbing Shen Yu's hand and wanting to pull her to his side.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's expression sank.</p><p></p><p>Damn, it's a sexual assault?</p><p></p><p>Such guts!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing immediately grabbed Shen Yu's other hand and kicked out at the same time.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, you're back!"</p><p></p><p>???</p><p></p><p>Looking at Shen Yu's excited expression, then at the burly man opposite, and then at his own hand holding Shen Yu's, Zhou Qing's kicking foot froze in midair.</p><p></p><p>Oh no, I've become the sexual assaulter.</p>

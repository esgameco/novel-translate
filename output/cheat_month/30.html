            <p>Chapter 30: Cultivation Breakthrough!</p><p></p><p>Reward Bonus!</p><p></p><p>The last time he saw such words was on Zhou Qing's first day of chopping trees, and that time it was a first-chop bonus.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that there would be a seven-day bonus now, which really had the style of a game.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing immediately thought that if there were bonuses on the first day and the seventh day, would there also be bonuses for half a month and a month?</p><p></p><p>But that was a matter for the future. Now, Zhou Qing only had one thought: chopping trees was indeed more exciting with reward bonuses. The normal drops on weekdays couldn't compare to the current ones at all.</p><p></p><p>Nine-Aperture Golden Pill, Golden Legend!</p><p></p><p>But this gold was a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing looked at the pill in his hand, which was dark gold in color. The pill had nine holes, like the nine apertures of a living being. There was a swirling airflow in the nine apertures, which looked like a person breathing.</p><p></p><p>The pill seemed to possess life!</p><p></p><p>But this pill, as well as its introduction, gave him a strong sense of déjà vu.</p><p></p><p>"Nine-Aperture Golden Pill, it's a good thing my surname is Zhou..." Zhou Qing muttered.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about how to use this pill, Zhou Qing took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>He had never tried opening a hole in his own chest before.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing put the Nine-Aperture Golden Pill aside first, as he still had one more chance to chop trees.</p><p></p><p>The second time he chopped the tree, only one light orb dropped.</p><p></p><p>[Exotic Item: Ghost Residence]</p><p></p><p>[A residence for ghosts, it has the effects of nourishing ghosts, strengthening ghosts, and slowly improving the potential of ghosts. Ghosts associated with the player can live inside, but it can only accommodate one ghost.]</p><p></p><p>This time, an exotic item dropped. The last time an exotic item dropped was that piece of chicken blood stone.</p><p></p><p>The effects of the two exotic items were completely different.</p><p></p><p>This Ghost Residence was a good item, but it was really useless for Zhou Qing at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Ghosts referred to the souls of people that remained after death due to accidents, with the prerequisite that the person was already dead.</p><p></p><p>The souls of living people leaving their bodies didn't count and couldn't enter the Ghost Residence. Not to mention there was another restriction - the ghosts needed to be associated with Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>However, this exotic item was undoubtedly a treasure. It could actually improve the potential of ghosts, even if there was an upper limit, it was enough to make many cultivators flock to it.</p><p></p><p>But for now, this exotic item could only be put away as a foundation.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou Qing firmly believed one thing: there were no useless exotic items, only useless cultivators! (Laughs)</p><p></p><p>The Ghost Residence was an egg-sized stone with a very deep hole on one side.</p><p></p><p>"Do ghosts live in the hole? Ghosts in the mountain top cave?" Zhou Qing made a series of associations, then put away the Ghost Residence.</p><p></p><p>Tonight, the highlight of chopping trees was undoubtedly the Nine-Aperture Golden Pill.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing found a knife, compared it to his chest, and felt a bit of a toothache. This was the first time he had ever self-harmed.</p><p></p><p>Steeling his resolve, there was nothing to shrink back from. Zhou Qing gave himself a knife, and a cut immediately appeared on his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing quickly pressed the Nine-Aperture Golden Pill to the wound, and another wave of intense pain hit him, a double pain.</p><p></p><p>But the moment the Nine-Aperture Golden Pill entered his flesh and blood, a different feeling immediately appeared.</p><p></p><p>The pain disappeared, and his whole body felt cool and comfortable. Zhou Qing even vaguely smelled a fragrance emanating from his body.</p><p></p><p>Especially his heart, which gave Zhou Qing the most special feeling.</p><p></p><p>He didn't feel that there was any foreign object in his heart, but instead felt that it was beating exceptionally powerfully, deafeningly loud.</p><p></p><p>With each beat of his heart, a heat flow would spread throughout his body, originating from his heart.</p><p></p><p>That was the medicinal power of the Golden Pill!</p><p></p><p>Under the effect of the Golden Pill's medicinal power, Zhou Qing felt that his body was constantly being subtly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>"What a treasure, it's indeed a treasure." Zhou Qing</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>He was very happy.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, once a golden elixir pill is swallowed into the belly, my life is in my own hands, not in the hands of heaven!</p><p></p><p>He hadn't reached that level yet, but a youthful version of "my life is in my own hands, not in the hands of heaven" was also very good.</p><p></p><p>"However, isn't it said that the Nine Orifice Golden Elixir also has the effect of washing the tendons and cleansing the marrow? Why hasn't my body changed much?" Zhou Qing was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Washing the tendons and cleansing the marrow, shouldn't it be the kind where black filth surges out from all over the body, making the whole person stink to high heaven?</p><p></p><p>But instead, he felt that he himself was fragrant now.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no one to answer this doubt for Zhou Qing, and the Spirit Tree did not have after-sales service either.</p><p></p><p>But this Nine Orifice Golden Elixir pill really worked.</p><p></p><p>Endless vitality, abundant energy, and an inexhaustible medicinal power made Zhou Qing's spirits soar, and he directly began to cultivate the Ping Tian Niu Mo Refining Form.</p><p></p><p>He felt that he could continue cultivating now without ever uttering a word of fatigue.</p><p></p><p>As Zhou Qing began to practice martial arts, the medicinal power of the Nine Orifice Golden Elixir flowed out faster and merged more thoroughly into Zhou Qing's body.</p><p></p><p>"Hoo! Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Between punches and kicks, there were continuous sound effects.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's body had already turned red, looking hot to the touch, and his physical strength had continuous explosive sounds.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, a rumbling sound arose in Zhou Qing's ears, and in his body, internal energy flowed, reaching every part of his body!</p><p></p><p>The internal energy covered his entire body, further strengthening his flesh, and he achieved a minor accomplishment in the Flesh Realm!</p><p></p><p>After the breakthrough, Zhou Qing slowly ended his practice, his face showing a joyful expression.</p><p></p><p>Seven days, in just seven days, he had crossed two levels from an ordinary person and broken through to the minor accomplishment of the Flesh Realm!</p><p></p><p>In Black Cloud Town, other martial artists taking about two years to reach this step would already be considered to have excellent talent, but Zhou Qing only used seven days.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the quality and quantity of Zhou Qing's internal energy at this moment were definitely not inferior to that of the major accomplishment of the Flesh Realm.</p><p></p><p>Internal energy was refined from the flesh, and its quality was closely related to the flesh and the refining method.</p><p></p><p>And the strength of Zhou Qing's flesh even surpassed that of the major accomplishment of the Flesh Realm!</p><p></p><p>With such strength, among the martial artist group in Black Cloud Town, he was no longer at the bottom.</p><p></p><p>Feeling his flesh that seemed to be filled with endless power, Zhou Qing wished he could kill a few Huang Shiren on the spot to boost his excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Another breakthrough..."</p><p></p><p>Since entering the extraordinary, Zhou Qing was determined to walk step by step to the highest point!</p><p></p><p>Leaving the Spirit Tree secret realm, Zhou Qing found that it was almost dawn.</p><p></p><p>"I cultivated for so long?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was a little surprised, not expecting that he lasted so long this time, actually continuing for a whole night.</p><p></p><p>He didn't feel any fatigue at all, nor did he feel that his body had reached its limit.</p><p></p><p>Practicing techniques, it was impossible to cultivate day and night without stopping, as the body couldn't take it.</p><p></p><p>But the Nine Orifice Golden Elixir, not to mention making Zhou Qing no longer have a time limit for cultivation, but also greatly raised this upper limit.</p><p></p><p>After tidying himself up, Zhou Qing didn't go to the martial arts hall, but went directly to Lu Qingmo's place.</p><p></p><p>He was already eager to absorb knowledge from Lu Qingmo.</p><p></p><p>With a breakthrough in the martial way, the Dao techniques couldn't fall behind either.</p><p></p><p>Walking all the way into the peach forest, Zhou Qing didn't sense any hidden guards along the way, perhaps because he had already been allowed to enter by the owner here.</p><p></p><p>This time, Zhou Qing didn't walk to the attic, but met Lu Qingmo in the peach forest.</p><p></p><p>Today, Lu Qingmo was wearing a red dress, her long hair falling naturally, without makeup but already incomparably beautiful, and with a mature aura adorning her.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding peach blossoms were in full bloom, lovely and charming, but at this moment they also paled in comparison - the person was more beautiful than the peach blossoms.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Lu, I've come to learn knowledge from you."</p><p></p><p>To become an expert's expert of experts, start with learning first!</p>

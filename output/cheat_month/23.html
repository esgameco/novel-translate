            <p>Chapter 23: Observing All Qi, Penetrating Secrets</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing looked at the abbot of Shanshui Temple, who turned out to be a young man in his twenties with a refined and scholarly demeanor, unlike a monk and more like a learned scholar.</p><p></p><p>"This poor monk is Neng Wu. May I ask what important matter brings you here, benefactor?" </p><p></p><p>"I'm here to ask for the abbot's help."</p><p></p><p>Abbot Neng Wu glanced at Zhou Qing and said, "You are a martial artist, aren't you, benefactor?"</p><p></p><p>"As for feuds and killings in the jianghu, I'm afraid I am powerless to help. Please go back, benefactor."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was surprised that this abbot, who was not a martial artist, could discern some of his background. </p><p></p><p>Could it be that he truly possessed the Dao?</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was also possible that Abbot Neng Wu's martial arts cultivation was too high for Zhou Qing to see through.</p><p></p><p>"I wouldn't dare to bother the abbot with mundane affairs of the mortal world," Zhou Qing said. </p><p></p><p>"But the matter I've encountered cannot be resolved by martial artists either."</p><p></p><p>"Abbot, I seem to have encountered a ghost."</p><p></p><p>Neng Wu shook his head with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Martial artists have vigorous qi and blood, and unmatched yang energy. What evil spirit would dare approach them?"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, tales of ghosts and spirits are illusory and unreal. Benefactor, do not take them seriously."</p><p></p><p>"What I'm saying is all true. Last night..." Zhou Qing recounted his experience and feelings of encountering a ghost a few days ago.</p><p></p><p>"I really did encounter a ghost. Does the abbot have a solution?"</p><p></p><p>"Benefactor, you may request a consecrated Dharma instrument, which may be of some help to you."</p><p></p><p>Before long, Zhou Qing saw the consecrated Dharma instrument Neng Wu spoke of. It was just an ordinary string of prayer beads, completely different from a real Dharma instrument. </p><p></p><p>This thing was purely for peace of mind.</p><p></p><p>As for the rest, Neng Wu expressed that he was also powerless, and directly had the other monks escort Zhou Qing out.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was somewhat at a loss. He still hadn't figured out whether Neng Wu actually knew Daoist magic or not. Bai Ruoyue and the others were also unclear if Shanshui Temple really had any Daoist masters.</p><p></p><p>As for directly asking Neng Wu...</p><p></p><p>Shanshui Temple had been open in Heiyun Town for six years, and there had never been any news of Neng Wu being a cultivator. If Zhou Qing went to ask directly, what difference would that be from grabbing someone on the street in his previous life and asking if they were a spy?</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing shook his head slightly. If there were no gains here at Shanshui Temple, then in the end he might still have to seek help from his master.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Zhou Qing's heart stirred as he thought of the Qi Observation Talisman he had obtained today.</p><p></p><p>The qi of mortals, martial artists, and cultivators were all different. If he used the Qi Observation Talisman, he could determine if there were any cultivators here.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing weighed it in his heart and made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of cultivating the Dao, using the Qi Observation opportunity here once was worth it.</p><p></p><p>And Zhou Qing was also quite curious about this Shanshui Temple. Was it really that efficacious? </p><p></p><p>Various types of qi appeared before Zhou Qing's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Some people's qi was pure white, indicating that their bodies were healthy.</p><p></p><p>Some had grayish-white qi, indicating that there were some issues with their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Most of those who came to Shanshui Temple were couples, and basically every couple had one party whose qi was grayish-white.</p><p></p><p>"Body problems, so that's why they've been married for a long time without conceiving?" Zhou Qing silently guessed.</p><p></p><p>But being able to conceive despite body problems, could it really be divine intervention? Or were there fertility-aiding Daoist arts?</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, there were also patrons whose qi was mainly white with hints of colors like green at the edges. This meant they had extraordinary backgrounds, wealthy or powerful families, but were still mortals themselves, not cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The following is the full English translation of the provided Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, there are very few such people, and those that Zhou Qing saw were not couples who came together, indicating that they were not here to pray for a child.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, for those who are wealthy and powerful, if they have been married for a long time without conceiving, it is very easy to find out the problem and then solve it, without the need to come to the temple to pray for a child.</p><p></p><p>The resources enjoyed by the powerful and the common people are, of course, different.</p><p></p><p>Using this Qi observation talisman, Zhou Qing would directly know the meaning represented by various types of Qi, which is the power of the talisman.</p><p></p><p>After observing the Qi of passersby for a while, it was quite a novel experience. Zhou Qing wondered if there was something similar to the Qi observation talisman in this world.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing then turned his gaze towards the Shanshui Temple. With just one glance, Zhou Qing was stunned for a moment, and then his expression suddenly became solemn.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Shanshui Temple, there were five blood-red Qi permeating the area, and they had all condensed into vague beast shapes.</p><p></p><p>This is the Qi of martial artists.</p><p></p><p>There was also a strand of pale blue Qi, vaguely resembling a human shape.</p><p></p><p>This is the Qi of a cultivator, which should belong to the abbot. The color and shape of the Qi are related to the visualization diagram used by the cultivator during their practice.</p><p></p><p>But now, this strand of cultivator's Qi was not the focus of Zhou Qing's attention.</p><p></p><p>In the backyard of the Shanshui Temple, where the couples praying for children stayed at night, there was a continuous cloud of Qi, a pink cloud of Qi.</p><p></p><p>Just by looking at it, Zhou Qing felt his body becoming slightly feverish.</p><p></p><p>That was...</p><p></p><p>The Qi of lust and desire!</p><p></p><p>This is a Buddhist temple, how could there be such an enormous amount of lust and desire Qi?</p><p></p><p>The scale of this lust and desire Qi could not have been nurtured by one or two people over a day or two.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing stared intently at the pink Qi cloud for a while, then shifted his gaze to a couple walking out of the Shanshui Temple.</p><p></p><p>The husband's Qi was pure white, while the wife's Qi was grayish-white, but within the grayish-white, there were specks of pink.</p><p></p><p>However, those pink specks were quickly disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing entered the Shanshui Temple and found several couples who had stayed there the previous night. He discovered that regardless of whether the women's Qi was grayish-white or pure white, they all contained specks of pink lust and desire Qi!</p><p></p><p>Passing by a couple where the wife's Qi was grayish-white, Zhou Qing overheard their conversation.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if we can conceive this time. May the Mountain God Dragon Lord bless us, we must conceive."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, we have already come three times, but still haven't received the blessing of the deities. Our neighbor Xiaocui conceived in just one visit."</p><p></p><p>"Our hearts are not sincere enough!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>As the couple walked away, Zhou Qing's eyes suddenly felt a sharp pain, causing him to involuntarily shed tears.</p><p></p><p>Covering his eyes, he staggered out of the Shanshui Temple and rested on a rock for a while before the pain in his eyes subsided.</p><p></p><p>Removing his hand from his eyes, Zhou Qing looked at the Shanshui Temple again. The various types of Qi had disappeared, as the Qi observation talisman had reached its time limit.</p><p></p><p>But in Zhou Qing's eyes, there was a hint of icy coldness.</p><p></p><p>The sometimes effective, sometimes ineffective divine blessing, the rule that couples praying for children must stay in the temple overnight, the fact that one party in the couple must have a physical problem...</p><p></p><p>If the wife has a problem, praying a few times would be fruitless, but if the husband has a problem, staying here overnight would likely result in a successful conception...</p><p></p><p>The sky full of lust and desire Qi in the backyard, and the specks of lust and desire Qi in the women's Qi after staying here for a night...</p><p></p><p>Shanshui Temple, what an efficacious Shanshui Temple indeed!</p><p></p><p>It turns out this is how it becomes so efficacious.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps not by divine blessing, but by human intervention!</p>

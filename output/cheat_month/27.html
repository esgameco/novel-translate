            <p>Chapter 27: Harvest (Please keep reading!)</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing and the others didn't wait long before a large group of government officials arrived at Shanshui Temple and took over the place.</p><p></p><p>The garrison commander of Heiyun Town personally came and expressed great gratitude to the people of Taibai Martial Arts School.</p><p></p><p>The subsequent follow-up and conclusion of this matter would be handed over to the government, as they had more experience in handling such affairs.</p><p></p><p>Once the matter was generally concluded, the government would naturally issue rewards.</p><p></p><p>The Great Qi government prohibited martial artists from fighting privately, but also encouraged them to punish evil and eliminate wickedness.</p><p></p><p>Notifying the government in advance to investigate Shanshui Temple could have been fraught with difficulties.</p><p></p><p>But in the current situation, the government would naturally display swift and decisive measures.</p><p></p><p>It was too easy for them to strike with a heavy fist after the fact.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, the Great Qi government still owed Zhou Qing a reward.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou Qing wasn't worried that the government would renege on the reward. It was normal for the reward to be a little slow in coming, after all, it had to go through the procedures within the system, he understood.</p><p></p><p>"This world... is really full of bad people." </p><p></p><p>On the way back, Zhou Qing suddenly said this.</p><p></p><p>Huang Shiren, the monks of Shanshui Temple...</p><p></p><p>These people, if placed in Zhou Qing's previous life, would have been executed a hundred times over.</p><p></p><p>The existence of Taibai Martial Arts School showed Zhou Qing the goodness and beauty of this world, but the constant encounters with these incidents also revealed to him the evil and depravity of this world.</p><p></p><p>From a simple interrogation of the remaining monks at Shanshui Temple, Zhou Qing and the others learned that these monks were all fake.</p><p></p><p>Before coming to Heiyun Town, they were all bandits, with more than one life on their hands.</p><p></p><p>But once they put on monk robes and branded themselves with scars of precepts, the bandits were transformed into revered enlightened monks.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this is the so-called putting down the butcher's knife and immediately becoming a Buddha?</p><p></p><p>It's somewhat ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>And all these things further strengthened Zhou Qing's determination to work hard in his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He absolutely did not want to die a unclear death one day.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yuantao patted Zhou Qing's shoulder without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>No need for many words, time will make one understand everything. Many things have to be experienced personally to be understood.</p><p></p><p>After returning home, Zhou Qing took out a few items from his bosom.</p><p></p><p>Seven incense sticks and four books.</p><p></p><p>These were all things he found at Shanshui Temple.</p><p></p><p>Having destroyed Shanshui Temple, it was natural to loot the spoils of war.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing took the items belonging to the monk Neng Wu, while the belongings of the other martial artists and monks were given to his senior brothers.</p><p></p><p>And sure enough, this monk Neng Wu who had surpassed the Visualization Realm had goods on him!</p><p></p><p>Daoist magic and techniques were Zhou Qing's goal from the beginning, he just didn't expect to achieve his goal in this way...</p><p></p><p>The seven incense sticks, Zhou Qing didn't know what they were, so he could only put them aside for now.</p><p></p><p>But things that Neng Wu carefully treasured must be precious Daoist items.</p><p></p><p>Among the four books, one was the visualization chart Neng Wu cultivated, called the Huanxi Immortal Visualization Chart.</p><p></p><p>But when Zhou Qing took a look, this so-called Huanxi Immortal turned out to be a human-shaped existence with fox ears, a fox tail, wearing a layer of thin gauze, with some secret parts vaguely visible, full of seductiveness.</p><p></p><p>This name, this image, one look and you know it's not proper. Zhou Qing directly tossed this visualization chart aside.</p><p></p><p>You use this to test your cadres?</p><p></p><p>Humph, vulgar stuff, he reads the Spring and Autumn Annals!</p><p></p><p>The second book was the "Lunar Absorption Technique".</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing flipped through it, and although there were some Daoist terms he didn't understand, he still grasped the purpose of this Daoist technique.</p><p></p><p>This was a book describing how to collect the essence of the moon to temper the soul, which was very good.</p><p></p><p>But the problem was that Zhou Qing couldn't use it.</p><p></p><p>Only when the soul leaves the body and grows to a certain extent can one begin to collect the moon's essence to enhance the soul.</p><p></p><p>In soul cultivation, after the Visualization Realm comes the Projection Realm.</p><p></p><p>The third book was called the Art of Incense Making, which recorded the production methods and required materials for several types of incense.</p><p></p><p>These incenses,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They are all treasures that can be used to assist in the cultivation of Dao techniques.</p><p></p><p>After comparison, Zhou Qing learned about the effects of those seven incense sticks.</p><p></p><p>Four of them are called "Mind Stabilizing Incense". After lighting them, they can stabilize the soul and clear the mind of distractions, allowing the cultivator to visualize more efficiently.</p><p></p><p>The other three are called "Soul Protecting Incense", used when the cultivator's soul leaves the body. When lit, the incense smoke creates an environment suitable for the soul's survival, ensuring no accidents occur when the soul is out of the body.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning this information, Zhou Qing was somewhat pleasantly surprised. These seven incense sticks are very useful for his cultivation. The key is that he now possesses the technique to make incense, so he can become a producer.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, first he needs to understand and learn the incense-making technique.</p><p></p><p>The fourth book is a Dao technique called "Illusion Dream Technique". When cast, it can drag enemies into an illusory realm.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it's a means of protecting the Dao that Zhou Qing needs and can cultivate.</p><p></p><p>He has already learned a lot about martial arts, but in terms of Dao techniques, no one has taught him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Dao techniques cannot be practiced blindly. They are related to the soul. If practiced recklessly and problems arise, the consequences would be dire.</p><p></p><p>Mei Chaofeng lacked education and ended up training herself into that ghostly state through martial arts.</p><p></p><p>If one practices Dao techniques without proper knowledge, they will most likely end up killing themselves...</p><p></p><p>The taste of illiteracy is truly unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>"This won't do. I need to find a way to learn about Dao techniques. I can't remain illiterate forever."</p><p></p><p>After reading through the Dao techniques in his hands a few more times, Zhou Qing had no choice but to put them away and begin today's soul cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou Qing didn't use the Mind Stabilizing Incense, mainly because he was afraid that Neng Wu might have added something to it.</p><p></p><p>Conveniently, he is going to meet a Dao technique expert tomorrow and can take the opportunity to ask for some guidance.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after completing a round of visualization, his physical strength was replenished.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing gave the spirit tree two hits, and three orbs dropped.</p><p></p><p>[Talisman: Explosive Yuan Talisman]</p><p>[Contains the Explosive Yuan Incantation. When used, it can cause the worldly Yuan Qi in a certain area to explode. Single-use talisman.]</p><p></p><p>[Low-grade Spirit Plant: Yuan Qi Fruit]</p><p>[A spirit plant of heaven and earth that can increase a martial artist's inner breath.]</p><p></p><p>[Medicinal Pill of Virtue: Life Returning Pill]</p><p>[When on the verge of death, consuming it can sustain one's life. Only effective for martial artists in the Flesh Realm and Meridian Realm.]</p><p></p><p>There's not much to say about the first two drops, as they have appeared before.</p><p></p><p>But the last one is actually a medicinal pill.</p><p></p><p>"The more times I chop the tree, the more varied the dropped items seem to become."</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, this is a good thing.</p><p></p><p>And this Life Returning Pill is also a good item.</p><p></p><p>If it's not needed, then so be it. But if it comes in handy, it could save a life.</p><p></p><p>Such things can never be too abundant, no matter how many you have.</p><p></p><p>In the morning, Bai Ruoyue took Zhou Qing away from the martial arts hall early to meet the expert who didn't show up last night.</p><p></p><p>"We're not going to the town's government office, are we?" Zhou Qing noticed the route was different.</p><p></p><p>"She lives in another place. Just follow me. It's not like I'm going to sell you off."</p><p></p><p>That's really hard to say for sure.</p><p></p><p>After turning left and right, Bai Ruoyue led Zhou Qing to a very remote place in the east of the town.</p><p></p><p>It turned out to be a small peach grove with no households around.</p><p></p><p>"How come I didn't know there was such a peach grove inside Heiyun Town?" Zhou Qing was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"You couldn't even get close to this place before." Bai Ruoyue grinned.</p><p></p><p>Hmph, damn martial arts second generation.</p><p></p><p>Entering the peach grove, the peach blossoms were in full, gorgeous bloom. Walking all the way through, a three-story pavilion appeared before Zhou Qing's eyes in the deepest part.</p><p></p><p>In front of the pavilion, flowers of all kinds were in full splendor, with rare and precious blossoms not easily seen outside planted there.</p><p></p><p>A mature, stunningly beautiful woman wearing a black dress, with an exceptionally outstanding figure and temperament, was bending over to water the flowers.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue also had a good figure, and her appearance was not inferior to this person. But compared to the mature beauty watering the flowers...</p><p></p><p>Eighteen years old was utterly defeated.</p>

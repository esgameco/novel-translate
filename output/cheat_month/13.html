            <p>Chapter 13: Two Chances to Chop the Tree (Please keep reading!)</p><p></p><p>As the night watch sounded again, Zhou Qing, who was practicing martial arts in the courtyard, slowly finished his routine, his eyes brimming with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Although it was still night, a new day had arrived, and he could go chop trees again!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing immediately returned to his room and logged into the Secret Realm of the Immortal Tree. Without trees to chop, he felt like he had lost his soul.</p><p></p><p>At first, Zhou Qing appeared in that dark space again, clearly seeing the full view of the Great Thousand Immortal Tree. The next moment, he entered the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>The secret realm was no different from the last time he came. The vast and boundless immortal tree, the long and endless river, and the axe was inserted in the stone trough.</p><p></p><p>[Player: Zhou Qing]</p><p>[Life: Acquired]</p><p>[Soul Realm: Sensing Stage]</p><p>[Physical Realm: Skin and Flesh Realm (Initial)]</p><p>[Stamina: 2/2]</p><p>[Items: Tri-Light Blessing Mirror (Magic Tool)]</p><p></p><p>In the data panel, there were changes in the physical realm and stamina. The former was normal, but the increase in stamina by one point made Zhou Qing very excited.</p><p></p><p>Great, great, great! It seems my day's efforts and sweat have not been in vain!</p><p></p><p>Without much hesitation, Zhou Qing picked up the axe and chopped fiercely at the immortal tree.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was still pushed back a few steps, and no traces appeared on the immortal tree.</p><p></p><p>This immortal tree was too mysterious.</p><p></p><p>This time, two orbs of light were "spat" out by the immortal tree again.</p><p></p><p>[Mortal Tool: Hundred-Refined Inner Armor]</p><p>[Inner armor transformed from the power of the Immortal Tree, comparable to inner armor forged from refined steel after a thousand hammerings, has a strong defense against physical attacks and a certain defense against inner energy]</p><p></p><p>[Magic Tool: Bead of Water Avoidance (Fragment)]</p><p>[A fragment of the Bead of Water Avoidance transformed from the power of the Immortal Tree, inheriting some of the abilities of the Bead of Water Avoidance, can avoid mortal water for a limited time]</p><p></p><p>The two items dropped this time were both tools. After seeing their information, Zhou Qing nodded. They were both good things.</p><p></p><p>These two items were incomparable to the previous drops, but the last time had a first-time bonus. The current drops were the normal situation.</p><p></p><p>There was not much to say about the Hundred-Refined Inner Armor. Many martial artists had similar items.</p><p></p><p>But this inner armor itself was actually very precious. Zhou Qing could use it for a very long time.</p><p></p><p>An inner armor might save your life at any time. Anything that could save your life was the most precious.</p><p></p><p>If Zhou Qing were to ask someone to make such an inner armor, the cost would be considerable. He definitely could not afford it now.</p><p></p><p>Getting an inner armor for free was something to secretly rejoice about. If other martial artists knew, they would definitely be envious to the point of red eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Bead of Water Avoidance was a famous magic tool.</p><p></p><p>Although it was useless to Zhou Qing now, it might come in handy in the future.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing planned to find an opportunity to test how long this fragment could avoid water.</p><p></p><p>Happily putting away the two drops, Zhou Qing raised his axe again and swung it down fiercely.</p><p></p><p>Give me a fierce burst of gold coins!</p><p></p><p>[Low-grade Spirit Plant: Dogweed]</p><p>[A spirit plant transformed from the power of the Immortal Tree, not of high grade, has the effect of strengthening inner energy when consumed]</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>There was even this form of spirit plant?</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing looked at the plant in his hand. It really looked like dogweed, except for a thin layer of light on its surface.</p><p></p><p>This was not ordinary dogweed, but the dogweed in Wang Wei's poem.</p><p></p><p>"I'll ask Senior Sister about spirit plants tomorrow," Zhou Qing thought.</p><p></p><p>He could guess what spirit plants were, but Bai Ruoyue definitely knew more accurate information.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Zhou Qing put the dogweed directly into his mouth, chewed a few times, and swallowed.</p><p></p><p>So astringent.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that in the two times he ate something in this Secret Realm of the Immortal Tree, neither was normal.</p><p></p><p>Last time he ate light beans, this time he ate grass.</p><p></p><p>After eating the spirit plant,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing felt several streams of heat suddenly flowing through his body, out of control. He immediately began cultivating the Ping Tian Niu Mo Lian Xing technique to absorb the spiritual herb's medicinal power to the greatest extent possible. </p><p></p><p>During this process, the wounds on Zhou Qing's body also healed at an accelerated rate.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Zhou Qing finished refining the medicinal power of the Setaria viridis.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation complete!</p><p></p><p>Sensing the inner Qi within his body, Zhou Qing's eyes flashed with delight. </p><p></p><p>If he only had one stream of inner Qi when he first broke through, now he had over ten streams - a gratifying improvement. At the same time, his entire body's flesh had also undergone a certain degree of tempering.</p><p></p><p>However, there was still quite a distance before his flesh would reach the minor success stage, with inner Qi covering his whole body.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating secret martial arts is the process of training one's flesh and strengthening one's inner Qi. The existence of inner Qi also has an imperceptible tempering effect on the flesh. The two complement each other..."</p><p></p><p>"If someone could possess inner Qi comparable to the major success stage of flesh refinement, it would greatly accelerate the speed of tempering one's flesh. The reverse is also true..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing shook his head. Wanting to have a physique or inner Qi that surpassed one's current realm was not that simple.</p><p></p><p>His physique did exceed his current realm, but not every martial artist was a genius like him!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing put the axe back in the stone trough and looked up at the boundless immortal tree, feeling a bit emotional.</p><p></p><p>"This immortal tree is truly mystical. I wonder what level of existence it is. If only I could keep chopping at it..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a flash of inspiration struck Zhou Qing. </p><p></p><p>The Great Thousand Immortal Tree was clearly an extremely high-level existence, beyond his imagination. Could he perhaps...</p><p></p><p>Use it for visualization?</p><p></p><p>This was infinitely better than visualizing some yaksha demon, right?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Zhou Qing immediately became excited. </p><p></p><p>The visualization image was crucial in the Visualization Realm. No, it was of utmost importance in the entire soul cultivation system. The more powerful the visualized object, the better.</p><p></p><p>This Great Thousand Immortal Tree was simply the most suitable visualization target for Zhou Qing!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing paced back and forth under the immortal tree, pondering the possibility of visualizing the Great Thousand Tree. The more he thought about it, the more promising it seemed.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if I can return to that dark space where I could see the entire Great Thousand Tree?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as this thought crossed his mind, Zhou Qing found himself flying out of the immortal tree's secret realm, arriving once again in that dark space.</p><p></p><p>The originally vast and boundless immortal tree was now fully visible to Zhou Qing. He could see the shape of the trunk, the patterns on the leaves, and how the roots spread out.</p><p></p><p>So clear and distinct. Zhou Qing was overjoyed. </p><p></p><p>The necessary conditions for visualization were now met.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was truly moved.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly left this place. After returning to reality, he took out the Yaksha Visualization Manual again and carefully flipped through it, searching for useful information. </p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Early the next morning, Zhou Qing arrived at Taibai Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>On the first floor of the hall, the ordinary disciples were still diligently practicing, hoping to break free of their shackles and become martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Someone said something, drawing the attention of some people. They looked towards the entrance of the martial hall. Zhou Qing walked in slowly with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>"Look at the clothes he's wearing. Those are the garments of the martial hall's disciples!" Someone exclaimed in surprise, discovering a blind spot.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, even those who hadn't noticed Zhou Qing before all turned to look at him.</p><p></p><p>It really was the clothing of the martial hall's disciples!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother He."</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Zhou."</p><p></p><p>The two hall master disciples greeted each other. All the ordinary disciples fell silent.</p><p></p><p>An ordinary disciple who had just registered yesterday had now, in the blink of an eye, become the most revered hall master disciple here.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing glanced at these disciples. Their eyes, as they looked at him, were filled with complex emotions.</p><p></p><p>In the span of a day, their statuses had become worlds apart.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing smiled faintly and said nothing. He went straight to find Bai Tian.</p><p></p><p>But this Taibai Martial Hall's uniform was indeed quite good-looking. Zhou Qing liked it very much.</p><p></p><p>Since he was now wearing brocade robes, he must act the part each day!</p>

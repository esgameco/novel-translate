            <p>Chapter 34: Pure Soul Energy</p><p></p><p>"Flying Swallow Chasing the Moon!"</p><p></p><p>"Returning Wind Falling Goose!" </p><p></p><p>"Flying Eaves Splashing Snow!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>In the backyard, Zhou Qing held the Hundred Refined Sword and earnestly practiced the Taibai Sword Art.</p><p></p><p>This Hundred Refined Sword was given to him by Bai Ruoyue, considered standard equipment for Taibai disciples, and was top-notch among hundred refined weapons.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue watched Zhou Qing from the side, giving guidance from time to time. </p><p></p><p>"Little junior brother, your comprehension is very high, and your Taibai Sword Art has improved further." Bai Ruoyue praised Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing smiled. In the future, I'm going to become a Sword Immortal!</p><p></p><p>"Even though a Flesh Realm warrior can't bring out the full power of the Taibai Sword Art, with this supreme skill, you won't be inferior to any Flesh Realm warrior in terms of swordsmanship."</p><p></p><p>"Also, how is your learning going with Aunt Mo?"</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Mo is very knowledgeable. Just in half a day this morning, she taught me a lot." Zhou Qing really recognized Lu Qingmo's knowledge.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that you've gained something... Wait, why are you also calling her Aunt Mo like I do?"</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Mo told me to call her that."</p><p></p><p>"When did you two become so close?"</p><p></p><p>"Just today."</p><p></p><p>But you only met her yesterday! Your relationship progressed that quickly?</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue glared at Zhou Qing and said:</p><p></p><p>"I was originally planning to have you display your talent in front of Aunt Mo as much as possible, but since you two are getting along well, there's no need for me to say more."</p><p></p><p>"I have indeed already displayed it." Zhou Qing smiled.</p><p></p><p>After understanding their personalities and ways of handling matters during the day, Zhou Qing became as high-profile as possible, fearlessly showing his talent.</p><p></p><p>The better you perform, the more you'll be valued. </p><p></p><p>Hiding your abilities isn't wrong, but in a suitable environment, you should let your edge show.</p><p></p><p>If you deliberately hide your talent and pretend to be a pig on one hand, while complaining about how unfair this world is on the other, saying everyone is materialistic and no one looks up to you, isn't that just having a mental illness?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Bai Ruoyue flicked Zhou Qing's sword.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, so slippery."</p><p></p><p>In the evening, Zhou Qing left Taibai Martial Hall swinging his hands.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he still couldn't "escape misfortune" and had a match with Shen Long.</p><p></p><p>This sparring session between senior and junior brothers ended in a "draw", without hurting any feelings or losing face for either person.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing also got one of the spirit plants Shen Long brought back from Black Mountain.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the hand Zhou Qing used to pull Shen Yu hurt a bit.</p><p></p><p>Who says brutes have no brains!</p><p></p><p>Entering his home, Zhou Qing immediately started visualizing the Immortal Tree without stopping. After leaving the martial hall each day was his time for soul cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Tree visualization was now more than half complete. Zhou Qing strived to perfect the visualization early, project his soul, and fly through the air!</p><p></p><p>During visualization, Zhou Qing also lit a stick of incense for mental focus. With the effect of the Clear Heart Jade fragment, no stray thoughts could affect him as he smoothly practiced visualization.</p><p></p><p>At midnight, Zhou Qing punctually started chopping the tree.</p><p></p><p>"Eighth day, twenty-two days left..."</p><p></p><p>With one axe chop, actually three orbs of light dropped.</p><p></p><p>[Exotic Item: Pure Soul Energy]</p><p></p><p>[Pure soul energy, containing no life imprints. Absorbing it can strengthen the soul and enhance the spirit.]</p><p></p><p>[Exotic Item: Sword Sharpening Stone] </p><p></p><p>[A sharp sword comes from honing. Using a stone to sharpen a sword can raise the sword's grade. Single-use exotic item (Limit: Quasi-martial weapon)]</p><p></p><p>[Material: Raw Stone]</p><p></p><p>[Contains extremely thin primal energy within, can be paired with any material for weapon forging to perfectly harmonize material properties.]</p><p></p><p>Two exotic items and one material!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing only glanced at that raw stone before putting it away, as weapon forging materials</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The pure soul energy was something that Zhou Qing discovered he had seen before.</p><p></p><p>After killing that ghost creature with the Three-Light Blessing Mirror, he obtained a light bean, which was the same thing as the energy that had just dropped.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the energy in front of him was larger.</p><p></p><p>"Pure soul energy is quite suitable for my current self."</p><p></p><p>That whetstone was very interesting. It could directly improve the grade of a weapon, but there was a limit. At most, it could only be upgraded to a quasi-martial weapon.</p><p></p><p>But this was already very amazing.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was very satisfied with the harvest from chopping the tree for the first time.</p><p></p><p>[Can quickly restore consumed qi and blood and internal energy after taking it]</p><p></p><p>[Low-grade spiritual plant: Small Apple]</p><p></p><p>[Has the effect of strengthening qi and blood and enhancing the physical body after taking it]</p><p></p><p>The pill and spiritual plant from chopping the tree the second time were both used for martial arts and were considered regular drops.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing put away the things that he couldn't use for the time being, grabbed the pure soul energy, and just like last time, it was directly absorbed.</p><p></p><p>Looking inward at his soul realm, he saw that the "puddle" in the middle of the soul realm was expanding at a visible speed.</p><p></p><p>In the end, its diameter was as much as fifty zhang (about 150 meters)!</p><p></p><p>Of course, this fifty-zhang spirit sea was not entirely due to that piece of pure soul energy, but also Zhou Qing's daily cultivation accumulation.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good." Zhou Qing was in a cheerful mood, his cultivation had progressed again.</p><p></p><p>The essence of soul cultivation was to strengthen the soul and let the soul undergo transformation, while spiritual power was a derivative of the soul. Its quality and quantity directly reflected the strength of the soul.</p><p></p><p>After taking the spiritual plant that was beneficial to martial arts, he practiced secret martial arts with all his strength to absorb the medicinal power of the spiritual plant and the golden elixir.</p><p></p><p>Now, one day of his cultivation was equivalent to many days before he obtained the Nine Orifice Golden Elixir. The efficiency of both martial arts and soul cultivation had greatly improved.</p><p></p><p>It was not impossible to break through in martial arts again in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>In the morning, Zhou Qing came to Lu Qingmo's place again.</p><p></p><p>Today, Lu Qingmo was wearing a white dress, which was another style.</p><p></p><p>But what surprised Zhou Qing was that he saw another person here.</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Mo." </p><p></p><p>Lu Qingmo nodded and introduced, "Yun Duo, my registered disciple."</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing, come here to study for a period of time."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing and the girl named Yun Duo greeted each other. The girl looked at Zhou Qing, her eyes full of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin." Lu Qingmo didn't say much and started today's teaching.</p><p></p><p>Yun Duo didn't listen, but went to do other things. As Lu Qingmo's registered disciple, she must have understood these basic Dao principles.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, Zhou Qing reviewed and consolidated the knowledge imparted by Lu Qingmo, and was about to take his leave.</p><p></p><p>Who knew that Lu Qingmo would actually call out to Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>Yun Duo also walked over.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing, do you still remember the matter of you being registered in the Ghost and God Capital Department?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing nodded, while guessing in his heart what Lu Qingmo was going to say next.</p><p></p><p>"All matters involving cultivators within the territory of Heiyun Town are under my jurisdiction." Lu Qingmo said, </p><p></p><p>"So occasionally I will specifically find some matters, take them from the Ghost and God Capital Department and directly hand them over to Yun Duo to do."</p><p></p><p>"Now I have a matter here, are you willing to do me a favor?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm willing."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing thought for a moment and did not refuse.</p><p></p><p>They were gradually not treating him as an outsider!</p><p></p><p>Good, this was very good. He just didn't like being Aunt Mo's outsider!</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the book friend Quark2021 for the reward, and thank you to all the book friends for the monthly tickets and continued reading.

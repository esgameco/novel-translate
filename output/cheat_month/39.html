        <h1>Chapter 39</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 39: Dragon Lord, Mountain God</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing quietly equipped a few combat-type talismans while retreating.</p><p></p><p>The crabs and shrimps that appeared at the bottom of the river were too bizarre. He had never seen beasts that could use weapons before.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps these were not beasts, but another existence among the beast tribes:</p><p></p><p>Demons.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment, human child." A male voice rang in his ears. Zhou Qing was startled. He saw the crab's mouth move.</p><p></p><p>The crab spoke?</p><p></p><p>It was indeed a demon!</p><p></p><p>"A disciple of the Taibai Martial Hall in Heiyun Town?"</p><p></p><p>"I am indeed a disciple of the Taibai Martial Hall. May I ask who you two are?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing didn't expect that these two demons would recognize the Taibai attire.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to know who we are," the crab said arrogantly. </p><p></p><p>"I have something to ask you. Just answer honestly."</p><p></p><p>"Since you can go underwater, have you noticed any abnormalities in this section of the Yun River near Heiyun Town?"</p><p></p><p>"For example, a large number of aquatic beasts dying or the river drying up?"</p><p></p><p>The shrimp waved its pincers and added, "At least a few dozen aquatic beasts dying. The three or four you hunted don't count."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's heart trembled. He didn't expect to be seen through by these two demons.</p><p></p><p>But at the same time, Zhou Qing also breathed a sigh of relief. It seemed these two demons were not here to cause trouble because he hunted the aquatic beasts.</p><p></p><p>"I've been underwater for a few days and haven't noticed the things you two mentioned."</p><p></p><p>The crab and shrimp stared at Zhou Qing, seemingly judging the truthfulness of his words.</p><p></p><p>"Since you haven't noticed before, are you willing to do us a favor?" the crab said.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to do anything extra. Just observe more when you come to the Yun River in the future to see if any abnormalities occur."</p><p></p><p>"If you agree, we'll tell you a few resource locations as a reward. You dive into the Yun River for cultivation resources, right?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing didn't expect things to develop this way. After some thought, he asked, </p><p></p><p>"I still don't know your identities?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the entire Yun River is our master's territory. What do you think our identities are?"</p><p></p><p>The master of the Yun River?</p><p></p><p>A flash of inspiration struck Zhou Qing's mind. He knew.</p><p></p><p>The legendary Dragon Lord of the Yun River who protected Heiyun Town and kept it free from the invasion of aquatic beasts!</p><p></p><p>Then these two demons in front of him... could they be the shrimp soldiers and crab generals?</p><p></p><p>"You can go back and ask your master what a great existence our lord is."</p><p></p><p>"So, are you willing to help us with this matter?"</p><p></p><p>In the end, Zhou Qing agreed.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that if he didn't agree, these two demons would turn hostile.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, this kid's cultivation is low. What use can he be?"</p><p></p><p>"We are always inconvenienced to go ashore, and we can't act recklessly in this section of the river near Heiyun Town."</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon Lord has ordered that we can't touch the spiritual treasures and various precious items produced in this section. Exchanging a few things we can't get for this somewhat strange human child's help will definitely be useful."</p><p></p><p>"That's true. I see he doesn't have an aquatic bloodline, yet he can still move freely underwater. He does have some skills."</p><p></p><p>"Who knows, he probably has some treasure to help him. After all, the Taibai Martial Hall was even mentioned by the Dragon Lord."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The shrimp soldiers and crab generals watched Zhou Qing leave with their token. The two demons communicated in their unique way.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing didn't continue adventuring underwater but directly went ashore.</p><p></p><p>"So fast?" Bai Ruoyue was surprised. </p><p></p><p>"Little junior brother, your ability isn't very lasting."</p><p></p><p>"Senior sister, it's not good. I encountered two demons underwater!"</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue's expression turned strange. "So you were beaten up by those two demons again..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Robbed again?"</p><p></p><p>What's going on with his junior brother? Getting robbed by people on the shore and by demons at the bottom of the water.</p><p></p><p>Does he have some kind of physique that attracts robbers?</p><p></p><p>"No..." Zhou Qing told Bai Ruoyue about what happened under the water.</p><p></p><p>"Shrimp soldiers and crab generals?" Bai Ruoyue rubbed the corner of her clothes, "It should be. I didn't expect you to run into something like this."</p><p></p><p>"Senior sister, from the tone of the shrimp soldiers and crab generals, it seems that Master knows about the existence of the Dragon Lord of Yun River?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue said uncertainly, "He should know, right?"</p><p></p><p>"I didn't pay attention at the time, but now it seems that he clearly knows something."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go ask Aunt Mo, she must know something."</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon Lord of Yun River?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingmo looked at Zhou Qing in surprise, not expecting that Zhou Qing would be able to indirectly come into contact with this person.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have come into contact with them, you have the right to understand."</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon Lord of Yun River exists, and so does the Mountain God of Black Mountain. In theory, within the territory of the Great Qi, only cities at the county level and above will have Xuandu Temple monks stationed."</p><p></p><p>"The reason why I am stationed in Heiyun Town is partly due to the existence of the Mountain God and the Dragon Lord."</p><p></p><p>"However, you only need to know about the existence of these two, and you must not spread the word. Within the territory of the Great Qi, the vast majority of deities cannot directly promote themselves or spread their faith."</p><p></p><p>Mountain God, Dragon Lord...</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing suddenly felt as if he was in a myth, glimpsing a true corner of this world.</p><p></p><p>"What should I do about what the shrimp soldiers and crab generals told me?"</p><p></p><p>"Just do as you agreed. The Dragon Lord of Yun River is a being who is friendly to the Great Qi, and his subordinates in Heiyun Town will not break the rules."</p><p></p><p>"However, has the Yun River also become abnormal..."</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, are you still going to the Yun River?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go and see. The shrimp soldiers and crab generals told me about a few resource points, maybe there will be good things."</p><p></p><p>Although the pair of crab soldiers and generals were arrogant, they were also very efficient in handling matters, directly giving Zhou Qing the reward.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue still accompanied Zhou Qing, she really couldn't rest assured letting her junior brother act alone.</p><p></p><p>She always felt that her junior brother was particularly prone to encountering things...</p><p></p><p>"Senior sister, do you feel that there seem to be more warriors going to Black Mountain?"</p><p></p><p>"Black Mountain has become chaotic for some reason, but chaos also represents opportunity. Some warriors choose to leave, and naturally there will also be warriors who go in to take risks."</p><p></p><p>It could even be said that there were more warriors choosing to take risks.</p><p></p><p>"Beasts, spiritual plants, and some special treasures are easier to obtain during such times."</p><p></p><p>"But it's also easier to lose your life. In Black Mountain, there are terrifying existences that even my father dares not offend."</p><p></p><p>Danger is often accompanied by opportunity, and vice versa.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing deeply agreed, "The Yun River is still better, with abundant resources and the water beasts are not particularly strong."</p><p></p><p>Basically, every time Zhou Qing went down to the Yun River, he could find spiritual plants. If it were Black Mountain, it would be normal to search for several days and come up empty-handed.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue glanced at Zhou Qing, "That's for a freak like you. What normal warrior has the ability to explore the Yun River?"</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, if your ability is exposed, the vast majority of warriors will be jealous of you."</p><p></p><p>Even Bai Ruoyue was a little envious. Her junior brother's ability was really too convenient.</p><p></p><p>The treasures that others had to work hard and take all kinds of risks in Black Mountain to obtain, her junior brother could easily find in the Yun River, and only had to deal with water beasts at the flesh realm.</p><p></p><p>It was a completely different style compared to other warriors.</p><p></p><p>For normal warriors, cultivation and exploration was at a difficult level, while for her junior brother, it was at an easy level.</p><p></p><p>She wished she could take his place.</p><p></p><p>Blame me?</p><p></p><p>In response to Bai Ruoyue's words, Zhou Qing made a little bear shrug gesture.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 11: The Human World is a Prison</p><p></p><p>Never able to see the peak of vitality?</p><p>I'm a wooden chicken.</p><p>Possessing the power of bloodline?</p><p>I don't know.</p><p>Master, whatever you think it is, that's the situation I'm in. I won't object.</p><p></p><p>"The power of bloodline?" Zhou Qing asked in a puzzled tone.</p><p></p><p>"Some descendants of peerless powerhouses are born carrying a bit of their power. If it can be activated, it will be a significant boost," Bai Tian said. </p><p>"However, the more distant the generation, the weaker the bloodline power becomes, unless there is a situation of returning to the origin."</p><p></p><p>"You possessing the power of bloodline is just my guess, not necessarily the case."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing pretended to nod blankly, but inwardly he was sighing. It seemed that others couldn't discover his equipment?</p><p>Or was it only warriors who couldn't discover it, and cultivators were needed?</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing suddenly remembered something and hurriedly crossed over the collapsed wall to the front of that pitiful woman.</p><p></p><p>"She's already dead," Bai Tian's voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was stunned, looking at the raggedly dressed woman lying on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Not only her, but everyone in the Huang Mansion besides those few warriors are all dead."</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a kind of Daoist art technique. Huang Shiren absorbed a wisp of their souls. As long as he dies, the others can't survive."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing clenched his fists, suddenly having the urge to kill Huang Shiren again.</p><p></p><p>"Most people in the Huang Mansion were accomplices in tyranny and deserved to die." Bai Tian patted Zhou Qing's shoulder.</p><p>"There were also a few innocent people... We couldn't save them."</p><p></p><p>"And for them, perhaps death is also a kind of relief... Go see for yourself, walk to the right and you'll understand."</p><p></p><p>Unless a high-level Daoist arts expert was present, they could detect Huang Shiren's methods in advance and break them.</p><p>But Bai Tian was a warrior. He only discovered this after Huang Shiren died.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing lightly nodded, first moving the pitiful woman's corpse to the corner of the wall, then walked out. Bai Tian stayed here and didn't follow.</p><p></p><p>After coming out, Zhou Qing saw a few corpses lying on the ground, as well as a few warriors subdued by Bai Tian.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing ignored them and walked to the right. At the end, Zhou Qing saw a few rooms with open doors and a cow pen-like structure.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing first entered those few rooms and found that each had a young female corpse lying inside.</p><p></p><p>Their condition was similar to the pitiful woman from the beginning. The exposed skin still had bruises, and there were iron chains on their hands or feet.</p><p></p><p>"Huang Shiren, I f*ck your..."</p><p></p><p>Inside the cow pen, there were also a few corpses lying down.</p><p></p><p>Different from the ones in the rooms, the corpses here were completely naked, with countless scars on their bodies. Some were missing arms and legs, fingers, and breasts, with various traces of torture.</p><p></p><p>Among the corpses here, there were both females and males.</p><p></p><p>In the corner, there were traces of excrement, and the entire cow pen emitted a foul smell.</p><p></p><p>It was a living hell on earth!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing couldn't bear to look anymore and rushed out, blue veins bulging on his hands and brow.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing those few warriors subdued by Bai Tian, Zhou Qing couldn't hold back anymore.</p><p></p><p>These people were all accomplices!</p><p></p><p>With a kick, he knocked over the few warriors and rained down punches and kicks.</p><p></p><p>"Are you still human? You can do such things?"</p><p>"Beasts, you're all damn beasts!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing furiously beat the few warriors until they were on the verge of death.</p><p></p><p>"Huff..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing panted heavily, taking a long time to calm down.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this is Heiyun Town, a civilized place. There are warriors here, and also the government. Why did such a thing happen under the nose of the authorities?"</p><p></p><p>"Why is there such a human tragedy in a place covered by the laws of the Great Qi?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian looked at Zhou Qing and said softly:</p><p></p><p>"This world... is just like this."</p><p></p><p>Just like this...</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was stunned. He suddenly thought of his previous life.</p><p></p><p>The level of civilization and enlightenment in his previous life could be said to far surpass this world, at least for the low and middle levels.</p><p></p><p>But on that planet in his previous life, wasn't there also...</p><p></p><p>Sure, here's the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Is there such a hell on earth?</p><p></p><p>Yes, and not just one.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention those chaotic regions in the previous life, even in those civilized and developed countries, there are some people in the city who commit beastly acts.</p><p></p><p>Now, in this more primitive, more barbaric world with extraordinary powers, such hells on earth will only be more, not less.</p><p></p><p>In such a world, people, no, not just people, but any living being that does not possess power, their lives are as worthless as weeds!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing had never felt so deeply that only by grasping power can one truly be considered alive!</p><p></p><p>The government does exist, and there are many kind warriors, but those who commit endless sins also possess extraordinary powers.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing has no intention of being a saint, but he is a person with a conscience, a moral bottom line, and has been influenced by the country in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>When such things appear in front of him, at least now that he has just crossed over and still maintains the values of his previous life, he cannot accept it.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, just seeing the information on the news would make him feel righteous indignation. Now that he has witnessed the "hell" with his own eyes, it has really had an impact on Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>This is not online ranting, but truly facing "hell" directly.</p><p></p><p>If any normal person came, it would be difficult to remain calm and ignore it.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing also thought of the female ghost he had killed. She was probably one of the occupants of those few rooms when she was alive.</p><p></p><p>"This dog-day world is really fucking bad!"</p><p></p><p>"Rotten to the core!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing suddenly cursed.</p><p></p><p>"As for the Huang Mansion's matter, let the government officials handle it later." Bai Tian said,</p><p></p><p>"I will take the lead and coordinate with the government."</p><p></p><p>With Bai Tian's identity, communicating with the government will definitely receive more attention. It is more appropriate for the government to contact the families of these victims later.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's do that. Thank you, Master." Zhou Qing felt very tired.</p><p></p><p>"That flag is a damaged magic weapon. Don't take it with you. I will hand it over to the government as well."</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian pointed to the magic flag on the ground, "Don't worry, the reward given by the government will exceed the value of this damaged magic weapon."</p><p></p><p>Using such a damaged magic weapon to exchange for more rewards from the government is obviously worthwhile.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing thought for a moment and picked up the magic flag.</p><p></p><p>"I want to destroy it to prevent others from using it to do evil in the future."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing trusted the government.</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian took the magic flag from Zhou Qing's hand, seeming to sense it, and then said,</p><p></p><p>"It was already damaged, and Huang Shiren deeply refined this magic weapon. His death has made the magic weapon even more severely damaged."</p><p></p><p>"As long as the two existing ghost slaves are eliminated, this magic weapon is basically destroyed. Unless it is reforged, it will be unusable."</p><p></p><p>"But the cost of that is no less than creating a new magic weapon."</p><p></p><p>Those capable of creating a new magic weapon would not look favorably upon this thing.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing nodded. Since it had become a piece of junk, he felt relieved and at ease handing it over to the government.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping a glance at the room, Zhou Qing suddenly thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"Master, can a cultivator like Huang Shiren, whose physical body has died, still survive with his soul?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian shook his head, "Until his death, he had never left his physical body with his soul, which shows that he was only a cultivator at the Visualization Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Cultivators at this realm do not have the ability to survive without their physical bodies. When the physical body dies, the soul will also reincarnate."</p><p></p><p>"Is there really reincarnation in the world?" Zhou Qing was curious.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know either, but there have been such legends since ancient times."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing coldly said, "Even if there is reincarnation, such a beast will only become a real beast in the next life."</p><p></p><p>"I will let these two ghost slaves be free. You can look around." Bai Tian instructed,</p><p></p><p>"If there's anything you're interested in, you can take it."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's eyes lit up slightly, understanding Bai Tian's meaning.</p><p></p><p>After defeating the enemy, the step of looting the spoils of war is naturally indispensable.</p><p></p><p>It just so happens that there are definitely things on Huang Shiren's body that Zhou Qing is interested in.</p>

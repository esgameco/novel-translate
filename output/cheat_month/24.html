            <p>Chapter 24: The Posture of a Great Emperor</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing stood outside the Shanshui Temple, his expression alternating between gloomy and sunny.</p><p></p><p>After taking another glance at the ancient Shanshui Temple, Zhou Qing directly turned around and left, with only wood powder floating in the air.</p><p></p><p>The string of blessed Buddhist prayer beads that could not be given away was crushed to powder by Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>Even if there was really a blessing, the light that these prayer beads were blessed with was evil light!</p><p></p><p>Walking quickly all the way, Zhou Qing returned to Taibai Martial Arts Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Little junior brother, what's wrong with you?" Bai Ruoyue was puzzled, seeing that Zhou Qing's face didn't look too good and his emotions were obviously off.</p><p></p><p>"Don't tell me you were robbed again?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing pinched the bridge of his nose, "Senior sister, I went to Shanshui Temple."</p><p></p><p>"That Shanshui Temple has a problem, a big problem."</p><p></p><p>"Are you referring to the Mountain God and Dragon Lord they worship?" Bai Ruoyue laughed:</p><p></p><p>"This is very normal. In the territory of Heiyun Town, it's fine if you don't worship deities, but if you want to make offerings to deities, you can only make offerings to these two. It's not allowed to make offerings to other gods and Buddhas."</p><p></p><p>"This is why Heiyun Town never had Taoist temples or Buddhist temples before. They would not change their faith in other deities for the incense offerings of a single town."</p><p></p><p>"What's the deal with Shanshui Temple then?" Zhou Qing asked.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue shook her head, "Who knows, maybe it was started by a few monks who left home halfway and had no inherited faith."</p><p></p><p>"Those few monks came from a foreign land six years ago. After getting permission from the government, they established the temple to accept incense offerings."</p><p></p><p>"Foreigners again..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was silent. Huang Shiren was a foreigner, and these few monks were also foreigners. </p><p></p><p>Why were all these foreigners running to Heiyun Town?</p><p></p><p>"Have the Mountain God and Dragon Lord really manifested before? Is the efficacy of Shanshui Temple related to these two deities?"</p><p></p><p>"No one has seen these two deities. There are many legends about their manifestations, but no one can be sure if they are true or false."</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue pondered for a moment, then continued, "Deities don't manifest that easily. Shanshui Temple probably has nothing to do with them."</p><p></p><p>"Senior sister, the few monks inside Shanshui Temple are not good people." Zhou Qing decided to tell Bai Ruoyue the truth directly. </p><p></p><p>"There's more to the efficacy of Shanshui Temple than meets the eye."</p><p></p><p>"I suspect those few monks are secretly raping and violating women under the guise of deities bestowing children!"</p><p></p><p>This was the conclusion Zhou Qing came to after observing the qi of Shanshui Temple!</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?" Bai Ruoyue was stunned for a moment, and her expression immediately became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"How did you discover this? What evidence do you have?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing immediately told Bai Ruoyue clearly what he saw when observing the qi.</p><p></p><p>"Qi of lust and desire?" Bai Ruoyue fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Little junior brother, how did you discover those qi?"</p><p></p><p>"I saw it with my eyes."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Do I not know you saw it with your eyes?</p><p></p><p>Why do you speak in such an irritating way?</p><p></p><p>"I'm asking why you were suddenly able to see qi?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know either." Zhou Qing played dumb.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, I left Shanshui Temple without much gain, so I really wanted to know if there were any Dao practitioners inside."</p><p></p><p>"Then I was inexplicably able to see qi."</p><p></p><p>After dreaming of killing ghosts, visualizing in dreams, transcending the mortal body, cultivation increasing rapidly night after night, the ability to repel mortal water all emerged. Adding one more ability to observe qi was no big deal.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, when Bai Tian finds out, he will always come up with a reasonable answer.</p><p></p><p>In such a transcendent world, what's wrong with me having a few special talents?</p><p></p><p>There are many people with talents.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing heard Bai Tian mention that some people are born with double pupils and innate magical powers.</p><p></p><p>Some people just slept and awakened the third eye between their brows, becoming extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>These are the true geniuses.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Heiyun Town has never produced such people before.</p><p></p><p>But now, Lord Zhou Qing has arrived, a true genius has finally appeared!</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that you awakened some special ability again?" Bai Ruoyue was a little suspicious. "Then little junior-"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Little brother, look at me, can you see my qi?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... let me try."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing stared at Bai Ruoyue with wide eyes for a good while, until his eyes became sore.</p><p></p><p>"I think I can see a little bit."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Quickly tell me, what does my qi look like?"</p><p></p><p>"The qi appears blood red, with the image of the Ox Demon Leveling the Heavens, and the scene of the Flood Dragon Demon Covering the Sea... there are some other strange images that I can't make out clearly, but they are all incredibly astonishing."</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue looked amazed, "I didn't expect you to actually see it."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister, let's just say, you can deceive others, but don't deceive yourself.</p><p></p><p>I didn't even use the Qi Observation Talisman just now, I was just talking nonsense, but what do you mean by this look of me not being wrong.</p><p></p><p>"I wasn't wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"You weren't wrong, at least not the first half." Bai Ruoyue said:</p><p></p><p>"The Ox Demon Leveling the Heavens must correspond to the Leveling the Heavens Ox Demon Refining Form, and the Flood Dragon Demon Covering the Sea corresponds to the secret martial art of my Taibai Martial Hall's Tendon and Meridian Realm."</p><p></p><p>"As for what you said about the appearance of an emperor... since the previous parts weren't wrong, this sentence should also be true."</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue puffed out her chest, almost bursting out, hmph hmph, I, Bai Ruoyue, have the appearance of an emperor.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was dumbfounded, "The secret martial art of the Tendon and Meridian Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"It's called the Covering the Sea Flood Dragon Demon True Power. My dad definitely didn't tell you about it, yet you saw it directly. Hmm, little junior brother, your ability is quite accurate."</p><p></p><p>What is all this.</p><p></p><p>I only thought of Journey to the West because of the Ox Demon Leveling the Heavens, and then made up a bunch of stuff based on Journey to the West. As a result, you're telling me that there really is a secret martial art named after the Flood Dragon Demon Covering the Sea?</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister, your whole family isn't actually human, but monsters, right?</p><p></p><p>"Since little junior brother, you have truly awakened the special ability to observe qi, it means that there is indeed a problem with Shanshui Temple..."</p><p></p><p>"But without exposing your ability, we don't have direct evidence..."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, let's report it to the officials and let the government solve this matter."</p><p></p><p>As a transmigrator, the first solution Zhou Qing thought of was to report it.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue rejected Zhou Qing's suggestion, "Do you think it's a simple matter to open a Buddhist temple?"</p><p></p><p>"Before Shanshui Temple was even established, they had already smoothed out their relationships with the government officials. Someone is supporting them. If we expose this matter, it's more likely that we'll just alert Shanshui Temple and they'll also receive the news."</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister, these remarks of yours are a bit dangerous and not conducive to unity.</p><p></p><p>"We need to first determine if Shanshui Temple is a den of demons like you said."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing understood Bai Ruoyue's idea, "Senior Sister, you mean we should investigate on our own first?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we'll go investigate Shanshui Temple tonight, without any delay!"</p><p></p><p>After making the decision, Bai Ruoyue called the others over as well and explained the situation.</p><p></p><p>While everyone was shocked, they also acknowledged Bai Ruoyue's plan.</p><p></p><p>"Those few martial artists at Shanshui Temple aren't very strong. The highest is only at the Tendon and Meridian Realm, and there are a few at the Flesh and Skin Realm. They'll be easy to deal with." Bai Ruoyue said:</p><p></p><p>"Only that abbot is a bit mysterious, he's an uncertain factor."</p><p></p><p>"So in order to ensure the success of this operation, I will go invite a highly skilled person to assist, which will also be convenient for wrapping things up."</p><p></p><p>"Then who will enter Shanshui Temple to investigate the situation?" He Feng asked.</p><p></p><p>"The place where the couples seeking children stay overnight at Shanshui Temple is separate from the ordinary pilgrims." Zhou Qing said at this time:</p><p></p><p>"So two people must go in and disguise themselves a bit."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister is going to invite someone to assist, and Sixth Junior Sister..." Zhang Yuantao pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaoyu can't go, it's too risky for her." Bai Ruoyue stated directly.</p><p></p><p>The others also agreed with Bai Ruoyue's words. For this kind of matter, letting Shen Yu, a girl, go would be too risky. If something went wrong, it would be a lifelong regret.</p><p></p><p>But if a girl doesn't go, then it can only be...</p><p></p><p>A boy.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the book friend Quark2021 for the reward, and thank you to all the book friends for your continued reading and monthly ticket support.

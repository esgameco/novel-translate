            <p>Chapter 28: The Difficulty of Cultivating the Soul, More Challenging than Ascending to the Heavens (Everyone, please don't hoard the book, keep reading!)</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Mo, I'm here," Bai Ruoyue called out loudly.</p><p></p><p>The beautiful woman waved at the attic, signaling Bai Ruoyue to bring the people inside first.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing gave Bai Ruoyue a look, wondering what the situation was.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, is your eye twitching?"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>I'll make you twitch to death!</p><p></p><p>After entering the attic, Bai Ruoyue busied herself and poured three cups of tea, quite in the spirit of being the host, as if she were in her own home.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, have some tea."</p><p></p><p>Just as Bai Ruoyue finished brewing the tea, Aunt Mo walked in and sat down next to her.</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Mo, you were just waiting for me to make tea, weren't you?" Bai Ruoyue realized.</p><p></p><p>The beautiful woman glanced at Bai Ruoyue.</p><p></p><p>"Last night, when you came to me for help, your attitude wasn't like this."</p><p></p><p>"You must be the new junior disciple that Bai Tian took in during the day."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, senior. Master accepted me as his disciple a few days ago."</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating both Dao and martial arts, your talent is indeed not bad. No wonder Bai Tian specifically came to ask me about the visualization chart. My name is Lu Qingmo."</p><p></p><p>Only then did Zhou Qing learn that on the day Bai Tian found out about his talent for cultivating Dao arts, he had already gone to great lengths for his visualization chart.</p><p></p><p>Master truly has a warm heart.</p><p></p><p>But no wonder Bai Tian said he could pull some strings on the government's side to see if he could obtain a good visualization chart. It turns out he has an acquaintance here.</p><p></p><p>"You did well in the matter of Shanshui Temple. The Great Qi will not skimp on your rewards."</p><p></p><p>"But you must not mention this matter to outsiders. The town government of Heiyun Town will also choose to downplay it and will not publicize it."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing and the other nodded. They understood the meaning behind it.</p><p></p><p>In the past six years, who knows how many couples had gone to Shanshui Temple to pray for children. If the dark truth about Shanshui Temple were made public, the consequences would be terrible.</p><p></p><p>The entire Heiyun Town could be thrown into chaos.</p><p></p><p>As for how to deal with the aftermath, that is not something a martial arts school should manage. The government is more professional in that regard.</p><p></p><p>This is a world with martial arts and Dao arts. When it comes to keeping secrets, it's not that difficult if you put it that way.</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Mo, it's all thanks to junior brother that we were able to uncover the true face of this demonic cave at Shanshui Temple." Bai Ruoyue shook Lu Qingmo's arm.</p><p></p><p>"You can't be stingy. You have to reward junior brother well."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing didn't say anything. At this time, saying he didn't want a reward would seem very hypocritical.</p><p></p><p>Reward me handsomely, I can take it!</p><p></p><p>"What visualization chart are you cultivating?"</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Zhou Qing didn't know how to answer.</p><p></p><p>He could reveal some of the special aspects about himself to Bai Tian and the others, but that didn't mean he was truly foolish enough to have no sense of caution whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to sense Zhou Qing's difficulty, Lu Qingmo didn't press further, but instead started talking about matters related to visualization charts.</p><p></p><p>"Visualization charts are methods for cultivating the soul. How well the soul is cultivated, whether it is powerful, whether it has potential, all depends on what kind of visualization chart you cultivate. This is the foundation of soul cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating those most common visualization charts, the soul will be muddled for a lifetime, the cultivation speed will be slow, and one will often encounter the calamity of losing oneself, losing self-awareness. Even if the soul luckily leaves the body, death is certain."</p><p></p><p>"Such a soul will dissipate with a gust of wind, melt under light, be annihilated by a clap of thunder, and die immediately upon encountering water or fire."</p><p></p><p>"Unable to touch the five elements, unable to withstand light and wind, having no strength whatsoever. If you don't want to die, you can only stop at the perfection of visualization in this lifetime."</p><p></p><p>"If the visualization chart you cultivate is more common, then in the future you will..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"We must find a way to change it before the soul leaves the body, only then can we go further on the path of the soul."</p><p></p><p>"Once the soul leaves the body, the foundation is set. It will be difficult to change the visualization image then."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing listened with a secretly startled heart, not having thought there would be such statements. </p><p></p><p>This soul cultivation is truly dangerous. In martial cultivation, even if your practice method is ordinary, as long as you don't practice it wrong, there is no danger in practicing for a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>But in this Dao cultivation, even if you don't practice it wrong, if the visualization image is not good, people will still die when the soul leaves the body.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, what I visualized is the Great Thousand Immortal Tree.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Bai Ruoyue listened and was startled, worried about Zhou Qing's visualization image, and what to do if it wasn't good by chance.</p><p></p><p>Although this junior brother likes to anger people, she doesn't want him to die.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your guidance, Senior Lu."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingmo shook his head, "It's not much guidance, just some basic knowledge."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing didn't take these words seriously. If a master considers this basic knowledge, he won't really think this is something everyone can know.</p><p></p><p>Basics also depend on the person, and even more so on one's background and forces.</p><p></p><p>"The things in that monk's hands should have reached you, right?" Lu Qingmo said again.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing honestly took out those things, he had specifically brought them over.</p><p></p><p>"Four Calming Spirit Incenses, three Guardian Spirit Incenses, just right for you."</p><p></p><p>"The Daoist techniques have not been tampered with either, you can cultivate them."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingmo commented one by one, letting Zhou Qing understand more information.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue looked around and pouted after seeing the Huanxi Immortal visualization image.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of visualization image, at a glance, is not cultivated by good people."</p><p></p><p>"This is your bias." Lu Qingmo said, "Except for a few visualization images that take evil as their foundation, the other visualization images have no distinction between good and evil, it all depends on the cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"However, cultivating some special visualization images indeed makes it easier to go astray."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Bai Ruoyue pointed to the Calming Spirit Incense, "Auntie Mo, isn't this Calming Spirit Incense the same as what you usually burn?"</p><p></p><p>"It looks similar, but it's not the same kind of incense." Lu Qingmo explained,</p><p></p><p>"The way of incense is vast and profound, and is an extremely important auxiliary means for soul cultivation, with effects no less than spiritual medicines and elixirs."</p><p></p><p>"Calming Spirit Incense and Guardian Spirit Incense are just two kinds of basic incenses, but they will be very useful for you at this stage."</p><p></p><p>"When your soul leaves your body for the first time, remember to light a stick of Guardian Spirit Incense."</p><p></p><p>"This Calming Spirit Incense can be of some help when you experience the calamity of loss."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing asked in puzzlement, "What is the calamity of loss?"</p><p></p><p>"Visualizing other things strengthens the soul, but at the same time it also influences one's own soul. At certain points, cultivators will not be able to distinguish between themselves and the visualized object, thinking that they are the visualized object."</p><p></p><p>"Losing oneself, getting lost in the soul's homeland, this is the calamity of loss. If one cannot break free, the cultivator will lose their soul and never wake up again."</p><p></p><p>"The lower the level of the visualization image, the more times one needs to experience the calamity of loss, and the more difficult it is to overcome. The highest level visualization images will only fall into the calamity of loss once when the visualization is perfected."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing fell silent, not having thought that this soul cultivation was so dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Visualization has dangers, leaving the body also has dangers, almost every step is a difficult hurdle, every step is life-threatening.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if there was no guidance from a master, Zhou Qing would not know these key points at all.</p><p></p><p>Just these pointers are already very precious for Zhou Qing, a wild cultivator, and can allow him to not be completely unprepared when facing soul hurdles in the future.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing made a decision in his heart, he must tightly hug the thigh of this mature beauty in front of him!</p>

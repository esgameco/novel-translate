            <p>Chapter 10: The First Time That Cannot Be Preserved</p><p></p><p>In a single day, shedding the mortal body and becoming a warrior!</p><p></p><p>Such a thing, even before coming to Heiyun Town, Huang Shiren had only heard of it, but had never seen it.</p><p></p><p>He even thought it was a rumor, hearsay.</p><p></p><p>Eh, now you've seen it.</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>A precious sword hanging on the wall suddenly made a sound, and then the sword left its sheath, floating and killing towards Zhou Qing!</p><p></p><p>Spiritual sword control!</p><p></p><p>This is the ability of a soul cultivator, completely different from the methods of a warrior.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing also noticed this precious sword, his heart trembled, and he wanted to avoid it.</p><p></p><p>But the two ghost slaves suddenly became fierce, and there was also an invisible force rushing straight to Zhou Qing's head, making Zhou Qing appear dazed for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>The precious sword slashed across Zhou Qing's body, tearing his robe, blood spurting, and a deep wound appeared on Zhou Qing's body, with intense pain, Zhou Qing staggered and retreated a few steps.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had just shifted his body slightly, otherwise the sword would have chopped on his neck.</p><p></p><p>"Just now that was... a mental impact?"</p><p></p><p>Before Zhou Qing could think more, Huang Shiren's sword and the two ghost slaves attacked Zhou Qing together again.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing hurriedly responded, but more wounds were added to his body.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss!"</p><p></p><p>The pain made Zhou Qing suck in cold air.</p><p></p><p>After Huang Shiren personally took action, Zhou Qing's situation immediately became extremely dire.</p><p></p><p>Although the two ghost slaves looked fierce, their attacks were actually straightforward. Even if Zhou Qing didn't have much combat experience, it wasn't a problem.</p><p></p><p>Confronting them head-on was fine, even random punches could beat an old master to death.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, with yang energy protecting his body, the two ghost slaves would be injured no matter what. In this way, the deficiency of lack of combat experience was temporarily concealed.</p><p></p><p>But facing Huang Shiren, Zhou Qing's disadvantage of lacking combat experience was fully exposed.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Huang Shiren would give Zhou Qing a mental impact from time to time, adding insult to injury.</p><p></p><p>The Sensing Stage could resist the illusion power of the two ghost slaves, but it was difficult to completely defend against Huang Shiren, the ghost master.</p><p></p><p>But as the wounds increased and blood flowed out, a demonic intent suddenly rose in Zhou Qing's heart.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that a pair of ox demon eyes appeared in Zhou Qing's heart, and Zhou Qing could no longer feel pain, falling into a state of frenzy.</p><p></p><p>"You are a genius, with outstanding martial arts talent and strong will. If given time, even at the age of twenty-two, you may not be unable to become a martial arts master."</p><p></p><p>A cruel and excited smile appeared on Huang Shiren's face. His own talent was not good, but being able to strangle a genius made him feel happy.</p><p></p><p>While talking, Huang Shiren's attacks did not stop. Trash talk is trash talk, but killing must be done.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was struggling to hold on, and the wounds on his body were increasing.</p><p></p><p>But Zhou Qing's coping level and combat experience were also improving at a visible speed.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing could indeed be called a genius, although it was created by artifacts.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing kept trying to approach Huang Shiren, but the ghosts blocked the way and the flying sword obstructed the path. Huang Shiren also kept changing positions.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Zhou Qing gritted his teeth. Damn it, if the magic weapon is exposed then so be it.</p><p></p><p>If he waited any longer, he would be chopped to death by this old pig dog.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the pattern of the Three-Light Buddha Mirror appeared on Zhou Qing's right palm again.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing equipped this magic weapon that he had been hiding.</p><p></p><p>The scarce inner qi in his body was poured into the Three-Light Buddha Mirror. Although the energy was not compatible, it was still a kind of transcendent energy after all.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Zhou Qing's body was enveloped by a layer of hazy white light.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Huang Shiren's mental impact was like a stone sinking into the sea, and could no longer affect Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the protection of the magic weapon's light, Zhou Qing's fists smashed into the two ghost slaves, beating them to wail continuously, retreating, and their figures became somewhat illusory.</p><p></p><p>The magic weapon infused with inner qi had much stronger power.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Then, Zhou Qing took a step forward, coming face to face with Huang Shiren. His right fist slammed towards Huang Shiren. In shock and anger, Huang Shiren thrust his sword towards Zhou Qing's fist.</p><p></p><p>Fist against sword, but at the same time, Zhou Qing kicked out, directly striking Huang Shiren's chest.</p><p></p><p>An ambush!</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Shiren was sent flying by Zhou Qing's kick, crashing into the wall behind him, which collapsed from the impact.</p><p></p><p>A piercing pain shot through his right hand. The precious sword had pierced into Zhou Qing's fist, but not deeply.</p><p></p><p>The speed of a spiritually controlled weapon was extremely fast, making it difficult for Zhou Qing to dodge in such a small space.</p><p></p><p>The light of a magic weapon had an excellent defensive effect against forces like ghosts and souls, but its defense against physical weapons was somewhat lacking.</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>The precious sword fell to the ground, and the two ghost slaves directly returned to the tattered small flag.</p><p></p><p>Huang Shiren looked extremely miserable, his body torn open, blood flowing everywhere. It was clear that he had already breathed his last.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was stunned, the frenzied battle intent in his heart suddenly disappeared, and he became much more clear-headed.</p><p></p><p>Huang Shiren... died just like that?</p><p></p><p>Died at his hands?</p><p></p><p>He had killed someone?</p><p></p><p>His tightly clenched fist loosened, the light of the magic weapon slowly fading. Zhou Qing stared blankly at Huang Shiren's corpse, even temporarily ignoring the pain in his body.</p><p></p><p>Since learning that he had crossed over to such a world, Zhou Qing understood that sooner or later, there would be such a day.</p><p></p><p>But Zhou Qing hadn't thought that this day would come so quickly, only on the second day after his crossing...</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing felt a bit conflicted in his heart. He didn't regret killing Huang Shiren, nor did he feel disgusted to the point of vomiting. He was unexpectedly calm, somewhat beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>But no matter what, he had ultimately lost his first time.</p><p></p><p>"Don't think too much, you were eliminating evil." A gentle voice spoke up, and someone patted Zhou Qing's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's body tensed, about to swing his fist to strike behind him, but his body was suppressed and he couldn't raise his fist.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing turned his head and saw his master's big face.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you... why are you here?" </p><p></p><p>Bai Tian put his hand down and said, </p><p></p><p>"Since I knew you were harmed by a villain, as your master, I naturally couldn't sit idly by."</p><p></p><p>"From the moment you left the martial arts hall, I secretly followed you."</p><p></p><p>"However, you did give me a surprise."</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, you are very outstanding, even more so than I anticipated."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing felt a warmth in his heart. He hadn't expected his master, as the head of the martial arts hall, to actually tail... </p><p></p><p>Ah no, to personally protect his disciple who had just been accepted today.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Zhou Qing's impression of this master was mysterious, and an extremely responsible martial arts instructor.</p><p></p><p>Directly imparting secret martial arts and devouring techniques, a ruthless martial arts teaching machine.</p><p></p><p>But now, in Zhou Qing's heart, his master had become even more vivid as a person.</p><p></p><p>Actually, Zhou Qing had long anticipated that someone would protect him after leaving the martial arts hall. He just hadn't expected Bai Tian to personally take action.</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon, while interacting with Bai Tian at the martial arts hall, Zhou Qing had already inquired about matters related to ghosts and those who control ghosts.</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian had also given a clear answer. The person controlling the ghosts to attack Zhou Qing must be a cultivator, but that cultivator's realm was definitely not high. After Zhou Qing tempered himself a bit more, he might be able to deal with them.</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian spoke with certainty. It was precisely because of Bai Tian's words that Zhou Qing followed those few big men to the Huang Residence. He had come prepared.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if someone asked Zhou Qing to come and he just recklessly agreed, do you think Zhou Qing is stupid?</p><p></p><p>It's just that Zhou Qing was now a bit worried. Would his master notice something from his use of the magic weapon?</p><p></p><p>What excuse should he make up this time?</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing, your background may not be simple."</p><p></p><p>"The power you suddenly erupted with just now seems a bit like the power of a bloodline," Bai Tian suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Yes, Master, you are absolutely right.</p>

            <p>Chapter 36: Turning Living People into Donkeys</p><p></p><p>"Bring a pot of tea and a plate of fennel beans!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, sir. Please wait a moment, it'll be right up. {What? You don't know yet | Read COM for chapters without mistakes | Hurry and google it}"</p><p></p><p>Yunduo's gaze drifted to the dozen or so donkeys next to the tea house. </p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing, donkeys."</p><p></p><p>How can you scold people like that?</p><p></p><p>"I see them."</p><p></p><p>Sitting in his chair, Zhou Qing also focused on the dozen or so donkeys, comparing them multiple times with the donkey hair in his hand. Indeed, a few of them matched.</p><p></p><p>"Hey brother, why are there a dozen donkeys tied up here?" Zhou Qing struck up a conversation with the person next to him.</p><p></p><p>"Some guy bought them from a few nearby villages and then tied them up here. Don't know what he wants them for."</p><p></p><p>"Where's the guy who bought the donkeys? Is he a Taoist priest?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't know where he went, but he'll definitely be back since the donkeys are still here. The guy's not a Taoist priest though, he's an old man."</p><p></p><p>"Thanks, brother."</p><p></p><p>The tea and fennel beans were served. Zhou Qing didn't let them go to waste and started eating right away.</p><p></p><p>Yunduo also tasted them curiously, but after a few bites, she furrowed her brows. However, she still swallowed it down.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing laughed. "Never had such ordinary tea before, huh?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't like the taste of this kind of tea," Yunduo said honestly. "The fennel beans...are okay."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing expressed his understanding. As the young miss of a major family in Heiyun Town, she normally wouldn't come to a place like this to drink such ordinary tea.</p><p></p><p>At first, Zhou Qing thought Yunduo would spit it out directly.</p><p></p><p>"No need to force yourself if you're not used to it." Zhou Qing said. He, on the other hand, drank it down gulp after gulp without any discomfort.</p><p></p><p>Drinking tea, what a pleasant thing.</p><p></p><p>"Are we waiting for that person to come back?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing and the others waited for about half an hour before they saw an old man slowly walking towards the tea house, herding three donkeys.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing special about the donkeys, and the old man looked like an ordinary person. But one thing caught Zhou Qing's attention.</p><p></p><p>The old man herding the donkeys had eyes that were too bright and spirited, not at all like an elderly person's.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Zhou Qing's spiritual perception also reacted somewhat, as if prompting him.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Zhou Qing quietly activated the Qi Observation Talisman.</p><p></p><p>The world of qi appeared before Zhou Qing once again. He looked directly at the old man herding the donkeys, and qi different from that of ordinary people was exposed to his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This was indeed a cultivator!</p><p></p><p>The three donkeys were clearly animals, but the qi they emitted was human qi!</p><p></p><p>The qi of ordinary animals was also white, but it was completely different from human qi. Those who could observe qi could tell the difference between human and animal qi at a glance.</p><p></p><p>Three donkeys possessing human qi!</p><p></p><p>And the dozen or so donkeys that had been tied up here earlier were the same, possessing human qi.</p><p></p><p>Appearances could be changed, but qi couldn't deceive.</p><p></p><p>In other words, these donkeys...</p><p></p><p>Were actually people?</p><p></p><p>Transformation techniques?</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing also observed the other people in the tea house and found no other cultivators. This area also didn't have any special qi, unlike the lair of this demonic Taoist.</p><p></p><p>"This person is suspicious. Even if he didn't commit the disappearances, he's definitely involved."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing wrapped these words in his spiritual power and sent them into Yunduo's ear.</p><p></p><p>Yunduo replied to Zhou Qing in the same way.</p><p></p><p>"Should we take action?"</p><p></p><p>"There are many people here. To avoid harming the innocent, let's wait until he leaves and then follow him."</p><p></p><p>The old man herding the donkeys tied them up and glanced a few more times at Zhou Qing and Yunduo. After all, their appearances and bearings were hard to ignore.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going out for a bit. Wait for me here and don't act alone." Zhou Qing suddenly said, then walked out.</p><p></p><p>Using his qi observation ability, Zhou Qing carefully investigated the surroundings of the tea house and found that there were indeed no traces of a second cultivator, only then feeling completely at ease.</p><p></p><p>Better safe than sorry.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Follow him!</p><p></p><p>The old man left the tea house once again, and Zhou Qing called for Yunduo to directly chase after him.</p><p></p><p>After moving away from the tea house, the old man stopped in his tracks and turned around to look at Zhou Qing and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Young master and miss from who knows where, why aren't you obediently going back home and instead following this old man?"</p><p></p><p>"You're in trouble now, come with us." Zhou Qing was already fully armed.</p><p></p><p>"Of all things to learn, you choose to play the hero. Today, I'll let you know the immensity of the world!"</p><p></p><p>The old man took out a wooden donkey figurine from his bosom, shifted his steps, and chanted an incantation.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the wooden donkey figurine's eyes lit up with a red light, fiercely shooting towards Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p></p><p>Yunduo threw out a bracelet, blocking the red light, and just like that, the old man's attack was resolved.</p><p></p><p>"A magic tool?!!" The old man exclaimed in shock, his face greatly changing as he looked towards Yunduo, "You're a cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>Then the old man turned and ran, his feet moving like the wind, running extremely fast.</p><p></p><p>Facing a warrior and a cultivator with a magic tool on her, if he didn't run he'd be waiting to die!</p><p></p><p>But Zhou Qing didn't hesitate in the slightest, directly charging forward the moment Yunduo's magic tool blocked the old man's attack.</p><p></p><p>The old man's speed was very fast, but Zhou Qing's speed was even faster!</p><p></p><p>A cultivator's body was stronger than an ordinary person's, but naturally couldn't compare to a warrior's, let alone Zhou Qing whose strength rivaled that of the Flesh and Skin Perfection realm.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Zhou Qing was about to catch up, the old man hurriedly activated the wooden donkey figurine again in his panic.</p><p></p><p>The corners of Zhou Qing's mouth moved slightly, and the power of the Three Lights Buddha Mirror quietly enhanced him as he struck the red light with his fist.</p><p></p><p>The wooden donkey figurine's attack was directly scattered by a single punch from Zhou Qing!</p><p></p><p>The old man was extremely horrified. What kind of monster was this?</p><p></p><p>Yunduo saw this and was also incomparably surprised.</p><p></p><p>Were Flesh and Skin realm warriors really that powerful?</p><p></p><p>At this time, the old man had already been caught up to by Zhou Qing, who grabbed one of his arms.</p><p></p><p>What good outcome could a cultivator have after being caught by a warrior in close combat?</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing raised his hand and pulled, directly throwing the old man from in front of him to behind him.</p><p></p><p>With this throw, the old man's appearance greatly changed, actually transforming into that of a middle-aged man, and his clothes also changed into Daoist robes.</p><p></p><p>It really was that wandering Daoist priest!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing stepped on the Daoist priest's hand with one foot, causing him to let out a wail of pain as the wooden donkey figurine directly fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing also tore off a corner of the Daoist priest's clothes to prevent him from casting spells or chanting incantations.</p><p></p><p>"Not going to talk, are you? Your mouth is quite tough, but I don't know if it's tougher than my fists!"</p><p></p><p>"Still not confessing? Alright, alright, alright, you really are a tough one!"</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing..." Yunduo softly called out. Zhou Qing turned his head to look at her.</p><p></p><p>"You blocked his mouth, so he can't speak."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing kicked the Daoist priest. "Your mouth is blocked so you can't talk? If you don't say anything, how would I know your mouth is blocked?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the cloth was removed, the Daoist priest immediately screamed for mercy.</p><p></p><p>"Spare my life, spare me!"</p><p></p><p>"Stop hitting me, stop hitting me, I did it all, but I was just acting on someone else's orders!"</p><p></p><p>This young man was too terrifying and didn't abide by any rules of the jianghu at all.</p><p></p><p>Too brutal.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Zhou Qing wouldn't discuss rules with him. This wandering Daoist priest's actions were no different from those of a human trafficker.</p><p></p><p>"Who ordered you to do this?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, ah! I really don't know. I came from Tianyue Prefecture, someone approached me there, gave me benefits, and told me to come here and use the Beast Creation Technique to gather some human livestock for them to collect after some time!"</p><p></p><p>"Let me go, I was forced to do this too. Spare my life!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing didn't expect this person to confess so straightforwardly.</p><p></p><p>Another outsider!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing furrowed his brows deeply. Every single vicious incident he had encountered so far was related to outsiders.</p><p></p><p>Also, this method of turning living people into donkeys was called the Beast Creation Technique?</p><p></p><p>This world really had all sorts of strange and eccentric Daoist arts.</p>

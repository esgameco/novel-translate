            <p>Chapter 2: "Celestial Master" Zhou Qing</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that all of these injuries were caused by that ghost to Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>The first two were physical injuries, while the last one was related to his spirit and soul.</p><p></p><p>The original body had died, so this soul was naturally Zhou Qing's soul. In other words, in just a short while, Zhou Qing's soul had already been damaged.</p><p></p><p>If he stayed with that ghost for a night, Zhou Qing dared not imagine the consequences.</p><p></p><p>"You wait for me, Huang!" </p><p></p><p>The original body was an honest person and had not gone to any strange places recently. Being haunted by an evil ghost must be someone's doing.</p><p></p><p>And from the original body's memories, Zhou Qing already knew who was plotting against him behind the scenes, who had killed "Zhou Qing" and almost killed him too!</p><p></p><p>After "Zhou Qing's" parents died, they left behind a house that Huang Shiren from the town had always coveted. Ten days ago, after his plot failed, he had threatened Zhou Qing with Zhou Qing's life.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing closed the data panel and looked at the spiritual tree in front of him. Today, he only had one chance to chop the tree.</p><p></p><p>One point of stamina meant that he could only chop the tree once a day.</p><p></p><p>Although this game was similar to a game Zhou Qing played on Earth, it was still different after all.</p><p></p><p>In the previous game on Earth, Zhou Qing only needed to tap on the phone screen to operate the character, and there were various props available.</p><p></p><p>As long as the screen wasn't broken, you could press it as you liked.</p><p></p><p>But now, it was Zhou Qing himself who was on the scene. It was normal to have some restrictions when chopping down such a great spiritual tree.</p><p></p><p>With his current physical condition, if he were to chop wood in the outside world, he would have to exhaust himself first. Having one point of stamina was already pretty good.</p><p></p><p>The field would not be ruined, but the ox would be worked to death.</p><p></p><p>At least this [Great Thousand Spiritual Tree] secret realm would not cheat him of his money.</p><p></p><p>Weighing the axe in his hand, which was not heavy, Zhou Qing did not hesitate anymore and aimed at the spiritual tree in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Life or death, it all depended on this one chop.</p><p></p><p>Heya, Half-Step Collapsing Fist!</p><p></p><p>No, wrong scene.</p><p></p><p>Open Heaven Axe!</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The axe chopped on the spiritual tree, and the force rebounded, causing Zhou Qing to retreat a few steps, panting heavily. At the same time, the axe fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The place where Zhou Qing had chopped the spiritual tree was completely unscathed, without even a trace of damage.</p><p></p><p>How embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, two balls of light flew out from the spiritual tree and came in front of Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>One ball of light contained a drop of water, while the other contained a mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Are these my rewards for chopping the tree this time?" Zhou Qing put down the axe and grabbed the items in front of him. The data panel automatically popped up.</p><p></p><p>[A magic tool formed by the power of the Great Thousand Spiritual Tree transformed into the three lights of sun, moon, and stars, as well as the aura of blessings. It has the effects of calming the soul, dispelling evil, blessing the house, repelling all evils, bestowing good fortune, and purifying yin spirits.]</p><p></p><p>[Bound to player Zhou Qing. Binding can be actively removed (equipment of magic tool grade and above will automatically bind to the player when dropped).]</p><p></p><p>[Postnatal Mortal Grade: Life Essence]</p><p></p><p>[The life essence transformed from the power of the Great Thousand Spiritual Tree. Consuming it can strengthen the essence of life and enhance the physical body and soul.]</p><p></p><p>[This is a special drop from the first chopping.]</p><p></p><p>Seeing this information, Zhou Qing's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Magic tool! Life essence!</p><p></p><p>They sounded very powerful!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing did not know how precious this magic tool was at the moment.</p><p></p><p>But looking at the abilities of this magic tool, wasn't it exactly what Zhou Qing needed now?</p><p></p><p>From the contents of "Zhou Qing's" memories, there existed special beings called martial artists in Heiyun Town.</p><p></p><p>The weapons they used all had special effects, surpassing mundane weapons. But according to the information Zhou Qing understood, the weapons of martial artists were not as powerful as this magic tool.</p><p></p><p>As for the life essence, which could directly enhance one's spirit and body, it was even more precious, involving the fundamentals of a person and could save Zhou Qing's life.</p><p></p><p>It could be said to be priceless.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed worthy of the reward after the bonus.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Zhou Qing directly consumed the postnatal mortal grade life essence.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, Zhou Qing felt a warm sensation throughout his body, and every part of his body seemed to be conveying a comfortable feeling, as if his entire being was complete.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing quietly experienced this feeling. At this moment, the pleasure was incomparable to anything else.</p><p></p><p>After the comfortable feeling subsided, Zhou Qing opened his data panel again.</p><p></p><p>[Player: Zhou Qing]</p><p></p><p>[Life: Postnatal]</p><p></p><p>[Realm: Mortal]</p><p></p><p>[Stamina: 0/1]</p><p></p><p>[Item: Three Lights Blessing Mirror (Magic Tool)]</p><p></p><p>Not only that, Zhou Qing also felt that his physical condition was better than ever before, reaching a new peak, even surpassing before he was harmed by the evil ghost.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing felt that he could beat his past self to death with one punch.</p><p></p><p>Not bad, this cheat was really not bad.</p><p></p><p>Then Zhou Qing reached out and grabbed the axe that had fallen on the ground, but to his surprise, the axe that was very light just now, he couldn't lift it no matter what at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Out of stamina..." Zhou Qing understood and was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Zhou Qing stayed in this [Great Thousand Spiritual Tree] secret realm for a while longer, exploring this place, but did not make any other discoveries.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the magic tool in his hand, Zhou Qing hesitated for a moment and decided to leave here first to see if this magic tool could deal with that evil ghost.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't stay here forever. If the evil ghost was not eliminated, he would continue to be threatened. Rather than passively waiting, it was better to take the initiative to attack.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing had a temper too.</p><p></p><p>In any case, if this magic tool couldn't deal with that evil ghost, Zhou Qing could always come back to the secret realm to avoid the limelight...</p><p></p><p>After Zhou Qing disappeared, the axe that had fallen on the ground suddenly flew up and fell into the stone trough from the beginning, as if nothing had changed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the room, Zhou Qing appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>Warmth and ease were far away, while coldness and tension wrapped around Zhou Qing again.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing felt his neck cold again, with a slight itchiness, and his left shoulder felt a bit heavy.</p><p></p><p>This time, without looking in the mirror, Zhou Qing knew that the ghostly thing had...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It came.</p><p></p><p>But the Zhou Qing now was not the weak Qing from before!</p><p></p><p>Without a second thought, Zhou Qing slapped his left shoulder with his right hand.</p><p></p><p>The Three Lights Blessing Mirror had already bonded with Zhou Qing, and then Zhou Qing discovered that he could actually "equip" this magic tool, that is, to have the magic tool enter his body.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou Qing was still an ordinary person now and did not have the energy source to activate the magic tool, so he could only use this magic tool in the most basic way to let the magic tool passively exert its power.</p><p></p><p>That is: smash.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>A sharp scream rang out, and Zhou Qing felt that he had hit something solid, unlike before when he hit his own shoulder.</p><p></p><p>A brilliant white light burst out from the mirror surface of the Three Lights Blessing Mirror, and Zhou Qing heard the sound of burning and exploding in his ears, and a fishy stench entered his nostrils.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing turned his head and saw that the light emitted by the magic tool directly blasted the ghostly face away, and the ghostly face even became smaller, constantly emitting black smoke.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a hazy glow was released and spread from Zhou Qing's right hand, enveloping Zhou Qing's body.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this situation, Zhou Qing's heart was lifted.</p><p></p><p>It worked!</p><p></p><p>Endless courage welled up from his heart. The ghostly thing that had almost scared his heart and liver out just now, at this moment, no longer seemed terrifying when he looked at it.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing strode forward and slapped the ghostly thing fiercely with his right hand.</p><p></p><p>Now it's my turn!</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhou Qing being so arrogant, the female ghost let out a fierce howl and also pounced straight at him, but retreated at an even faster speed and became even smaller in size.</p><p></p><p>The power of the magic tool was terrifyingly formidable!</p><p></p><p>The female ghost kept howling fiercely, and then actually chose to turn around and run.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing immediately chased after her, feeling extremely excited in his heart, feeling that his whole body was full of strength.</p><p></p><p>Offending your Grandpa Zhou and still wanting to run?</p><p></p><p>Die!</p><p></p><p>Breaking through the door, Zhou Qing became more and more energetic, having long forgotten what fear was.</p><p></p><p>He was no longer the ordinary person Zhou Qing, but the ghost-catching "Heavenly Master" Zhou Qing!</p><p></p><p>She fled, he chased.</p><p></p><p>After being hit by Zhou Qing twice, the ghostly thing had already been severely injured. Under the power of the magic tool, it was a luxury for the ghostly thing to want to escape.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because of the severe injuries, the ghostly thing could no longer control its own aura, and the yin and ghostly aura spread out unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>This had no effect on Zhou Qing, who was protected by the magic tool, but such uncovered yin energy could easily be sensed by those with true Dao cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Chasing into the courtyard, Zhou Qing attacked again with a heavy fist, and the ghostly thing had no strength to escape and fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing came to the front of the female ghost, and the female ghost had a fierce expression.</p><p></p><p>"Can you understand human speech?" Zhou Qing said, but what he got in return was an attack from the female ghost that no longer had much power.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing shook his head. He didn't understand how the thing in front of him was born, but it probably didn't have much intelligence and couldn't communicate.</p><p></p><p>He had originally wanted to confirm whether the mastermind behind the scenes was really as he thought.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing raised his hand again and slapped down. The female ghost gradually shrank and disappeared amid wailing.</p><p></p><p>In the ghostly thing under his palm, just before it was about to disappear, a clarity appeared in its turbid and crazy eyes. In her gaze, there seemed to be gratitude, as well as relief.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was silent in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be a ghost with a story.</p><p></p><p>But there were too many people with stories in the world.</p><p></p><p>Besides, when a person dies, it's like a lamp going out. Go to the place you should go.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the ghostly face disappeared, and the light of the magic tool also retracted back into the mirror, but Zhou Qing saw a milky white light bean the size of a soybean floating between his palms.</p><p></p><p>After seeing that light bean, Zhou Qing felt a deep desire welling up from the bottom of his heart, wanting to eat it.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing restrained this impulse with all his strength, but unexpectedly, the light bean actually entered his body in an instant along the mirror.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was greatly shocked, and then felt a sense of mental pleasure, and at the same time, his body became lighter, as if he was about to ascend like an immortal.</p><p></p><p>"Pop!"</p><p></p><p>In a daze, Zhou Qing arrived at another place.</p><p></p><p>This was a narrow space, with gray fog at the edges, and it was unclear what was in the fog.</p><p></p><p>In the center of this space, there was a "small puddle" with colorful and very gorgeous liquid inside.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing felt that his current state was very strange. He did not appear here as a person, but seemed to have only a perspective to observe the situation here.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this? How do I leave?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he thought of this, Zhou Qing exited the space he was in just now.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Zhou Qing directly entered the Immortal Tree Secret Realm and checked his changes from the panel.</p><p></p><p>This was better than guessing blindly by himself.</p><p></p><p>[Player: Zhou Qing]</p><p></p><p>[Life: Acquired]</p><p></p><p>[Soul Realm: Sensing Stage]</p><p></p><p>[Physical Realm: Mortal]</p><p></p><p>[Stamina: ...]</p><p></p><p>Everything else remained unchanged, except for the realm section, which was divided into two items: Soul Realm and Physical Realm.</p><p></p><p>The physical body was still mortal, but the soul had already reached the Sensing Stage!</p><p></p><p>"That place just now, could it be something like the Sea of Consciousness?" Zhou Qing came to his senses.</p><p></p><p>"That light bean, is it something like soul power?"</p><p></p><p>In the original's memory, there was only information related to warriors, and there was no information about the Soul Realm.</p><p></p><p>But as a transmigrator, Zhou Qing could easily associate these things.</p><p></p><p>In this world, there were countless legends of Taoist priests and demons. Combined with Zhou Qing's personal experience, those legends... were probably true.</p><p></p><p>Soul cultivation was probably another path different from that of warriors.</p><p></p><p>Although the process of opening the "Sea of Consciousness" and entering the Sensing Stage was confusing, Zhou Qing was still very happy.</p><p></p><p>"In this way, I still have to thank Huang Shiren. If it weren't for him, how could I have so easily set foot on the path of soul cultivation."</p><p></p><p>The life-threatening thing had become a breakthrough, and the two extremes were reversed. The negative emotions in Zhou Qing's heart were swept away, and there was nothing more refreshing than this.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing decided that in the future, he must "repay" Huang Shiren well!</p>

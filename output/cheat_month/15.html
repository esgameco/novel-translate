            <p>Chapter 15: The Three Absolutes of Taibai (Changed the Cover)</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, has it increased?" </p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue stared at Zhou Qing and finally uttered two words.</p><p></p><p>"Freak."</p><p></p><p>"In just one night, your inner qi has become so much more profound. Junior Brother, you always bring surprises."</p><p></p><p>"As I practiced, my inner qi grew stronger," Zhou Qing said humbly, naturally not mentioning the matter of spiritual plants.</p><p></p><p>This progress was all thanks to his own efforts!</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue sighed, "Junior Brother, if you had started cultivating at the age of twelve, your cultivation would have definitely surpassed mine."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, what is your current cultivation level?" Zhou Qing asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Visceral realm." Bai Ruoyue explained to Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>"In martial dao cultivation, first train the skin and flesh, then temper the tendons and vessels, and strengthen the viscera."</p><p></p><p>"I am now at the third realm of the martial dao. The other junior brothers are mostly at the tendon and vessel realm."</p><p></p><p>"I am eighteen years old this year and have been cultivating for six years. I have made some achievements. Among my peers in Heiyun Town, no one is stronger than me."</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue was obviously a little proud.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was not surprised that his senior sister was a genius, which could be seen from the fact that she had also mastered the secret martial arts.</p><p></p><p>What Zhou Qing was more concerned about was that his senior sister, who had become so "fat", was only eighteen years old?</p><p></p><p>This is eighteen years old?</p><p></p><p>The future is truly limitless...</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, if you cultivate diligently, your future achievements will not be small either." Bai Ruoyue said seriously,</p><p></p><p>"When the time comes, we will join forces to make Taibai Martial Hall the number one in Heiyun Town, and even spread its reputation to the wider regions outside!"</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue's eyes shone as she said this.</p><p></p><p>"My dream is to make Taibai Martial Hall the most famous holy land of martial arts in Daqi!"</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, you have great talent. In the future, you must help your senior sister."</p><p></p><p>It was normal for Bai Ruoyue to say such things and not abrupt, because from the moment Zhou Qing became an apprentice, he was already bound to this place.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the martial hall is my home!" Zhou Qing did not refuse.</p><p></p><p>Although he had not been at Taibai Martial Hall for long, everyone here was very nice, spoke well, and took good care of him.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing approved of this place, and he had no intention of betraying his master or stealing the martial hall's secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>Promoting Taibai Martial Hall is our duty!</p><p></p><p>And the first step in promoting Taibai Martial Hall is to read!</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon, Zhou Qing sat cross-legged, and his abdomen could be seen heaving violently, as if there were special changes happening inside.</p><p></p><p>The sound of the ox demon faintly rang out, and Zhou Qing opened his eyes, feeling a little excited.</p><p></p><p>"The Swallowing Sun Technique, I've entered the door!"</p><p></p><p>This secret technique about eating, under Bai Tian's guidance, took Zhou Qing half an hour to finally enter the door.</p><p></p><p>Such a secret technique mainly involves the stomach and intestines, using a special method to stimulate them, giving them strong digestion and absorption abilities.</p><p></p><p>According to Bai Tian, cultivating the Swallowing Sun Technique in advance has certain benefits for Zhou Qing's future cultivation in the visceral realm.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing picked up the beast meat that had been prepared long ago and swallowed it in one mouthful. The Swallowing Sun Technique operated, and in no time, it was broken down, digested, and absorbed.</p><p></p><p>Such a stomach and intestines are simply terrifying!</p><p></p><p>No wonder it is said that when the Swallowing Sun Technique is further refined, one can survive by eating stones and soil.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing could not do this yet. The difficulty of digesting stones and digesting meat is not the same.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Bai Tian and Zhang Yuantao walked over.</p><p></p><p>"Entering the door of the Swallowing Sun Technique in half an hour, Junior Brother, your talent is really enviable." Zhang Yuantao praised.</p><p></p><p>To be able to enter Bai Tian's door, he was undoubtedly also a genius.</p><p></p><p>But among geniuses, there are also gaps.</p><p></p><p>Compared to this little junior brother, Zhang Yuantao felt deeply that he was "dull and incompetent".</p><p></p><p>This was Bai Tian's third disciple, a steady person who could be said to be Bai Tian's right-hand man. Most of the matters of the martial hall were handled by him.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue was the senior sister, He Feng was the fifth disciple, and there was another fourth disciple named Su Chang'an.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>One of the sixth disciples, Shen Yu, like Bai Ruoyue, is female.</p><p></p><p>As for Shen Long, the second disciple during the day, he is currently not at the martial arts school. According to others, he has entered the Black Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing felt a bit fortunate after becoming a disciple, as he entered the school neither too early nor too late.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would either be the sixth or the eighth disciple...</p><p></p><p>"Master, Third Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>"You have already learned the methods of practice and eating."</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian gently asked, "As a martial artist, do you know what you still lack?"</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Zhou Qing replied, "Fighting techniques!"</p><p></p><p>"Correct, it's the fighting techniques," Bai Tian said.</p><p></p><p>"My Taibai Martial Arts School has three ultimate arts: sword, fist, and footwork."</p><p></p><p>"You can cultivate all three of these ultimate arts."</p><p></p><p>"However, sword techniques are difficult to master, so you should focus on fist and footwork techniques first, with sword techniques as a supplement."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing nodded, but another set of three ultimate arts involuntarily surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Oh, just thinking about it made his toes curl.</p><p></p><p>Sword techniques are difficult to learn because practicing the sword is a lifelong endeavor.</p><p></p><p>However, among these three ultimate arts, Zhou Qing was most interested in sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>If a Taibai disciple doesn't practice the sword, can they still be called a Taibai disciple?</p><p></p><p>"Also, you must understand that practicing the methods is fundamental. You cannot slack off in practicing the methods because of the ultimate arts."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Bai Tian personally taught Zhou Qing the three ultimate arts. Zhang Yuantao only came to check on Zhou Qing in passing and left after a short while.</p><p></p><p>The Taibai ultimate arts are well-known throughout Black Cloud Town.</p><p></p><p>The three practice methods that martial arts school apprentices can cultivate belong to the Taibai Fist techniques, including the Flesh Tempering Method. After that, there are the Tendon and Meridian Tempering Method and the Viscera Tempering Method.</p><p></p><p>However, those are not accessible to apprentices.</p><p></p><p>There is another group within the martial arts school: the advanced apprentices.</p><p></p><p>They continue to practice the Flesh Tempering Method, but the martial arts school will also teach them fighting techniques. Practice and fighting techniques progress side by side.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the fighting techniques that advanced apprentices can learn are not the Taibai ultimate arts but other martial arts that Bai Tian either created himself or collected from elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>This teaching session lasted directly until evening.</p><p></p><p>"It takes more than a day or two to master the three ultimate arts," Bai Tian warned.</p><p></p><p>"You are not far from becoming a true disciple. From now on, practice diligently, and you will eventually achieve success."</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian felt a bit emotional. His little disciple was really easy to teach. Many key points were understood with just a hint and learned with just one lesson.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, in terms of learning difficulty alone, fighting techniques are more challenging than practice methods.</p><p></p><p>Yet this disciple's learning speed was still very fast.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing strongly suspected that the Life Origin might have also enhanced his comprehension, providing a comprehensive improvement.</p><p></p><p>"There's one more thing. Since you have a talent for cultivating Dao techniques, the precious sword you obtained from Huang Shiren will be very useful to you."</p><p></p><p>"Does that sword have any special properties?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing didn't bring Huang Shiren's sword home. Bai Tian said he would take a look at it first.</p><p></p><p>"It is a precious sword forged from a soul material called Soul Silver. Although it is not a magic weapon, it is most suitable for spiritual control."</p><p></p><p>"Soul materials?" Zhou Qing was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Most martial artists' weapons are made of metals and ores, but such weapons are only suitable for martial artists to use. It is extremely difficult for cultivators to control them with spiritual power, like a child wielding an iron hammer."</p><p></p><p>"However, some materials naturally possess soul characteristics. If they are made into weapons, cultivators can easily merge their spiritual power with the weapons, controlling them like their own arms."</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian explained some cultivation knowledge in detail. Such knowledge was known by only a few people in the entire Black Cloud Town.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing pondered and said, "I don't know what background this Huang Shiren has, but his wealth seems to be quite substantial."</p><p></p><p>"This is Black Cloud Town. No matter what his background is, he can't make much of a splash here," Bai Tian said, unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>After eating at the martial arts school, Zhou Qing hurried home.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Zhou Qing directly entered the Immortal Tree Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>He was preparing to visualize the Great Thousand Immortal Tree!</p>

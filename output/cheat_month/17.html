            <p>Chapter 17: New Drops!</p><p></p><p>Looking at Zhou Qing's "confused" face, Bai Ruoyue found it a bit hard to accept.</p><p></p><p>What on earth are you? Why are you so strange?</p><p></p><p>The night before last, his internal energy greatly increased, and last night, his flesh and skin became stronger.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue had always been very confident in her own talent. Even if Zhou Qing had exceptional talent, she didn't think Zhou Qing could catch up to her.</p><p></p><p>After all, there was a difference of two or three realms.</p><p></p><p>But now, Bai Ruoyue began to waver.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, what's wrong with you?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk, I want to be quiet."</p><p></p><p>How come both father and daughter want to be quiet?</p><p></p><p>"By the way, why did you suddenly call me Senior Sister? Didn't you call me Sister in the previous times?" Bai Ruoyue suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was stumped by the question, his eyes wandering, and said, "Because of respect."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>That night, at twelve o'clock, Zhou Qing entered the secret realm on time.</p><p></p><p>The replenishment of physical strength was what he looked forward to the most now.</p><p></p><p>He loved chopping trees and wanted to chop trees for a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>The axe was raised high and then fell heavily to the ground. To Zhou Qing's surprise, three things dropped directly this time.</p><p></p><p>[Low-grade Spiritual Plant: Sunflower Fruit]</p><p></p><p>[A spiritual plant of heaven and earth, possessing the dual effects of strengthening the physical body and internal energy]</p><p></p><p>[Mortal Weapon: Hundred-Refined Helmet]</p><p></p><p>[Possesses strong physical defense ability and a certain amount of internal energy defense ability]</p><p></p><p>[Mortal Weapon: Hundred-Refined Gloves]</p><p></p><p>[Possesses a certain amount of defense ability and a certain amount of attack power, both offensive and defensive]</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing took a look at the two Hundred-Refined weapons and put them away. These were good things, but there was no need to study them much.</p><p></p><p>Another spiritual plant dropped, which made Zhou Qing very happy.</p><p></p><p>"Sunflower fruit... isn't that just sunflower seeds? Why say it so formally!"</p><p></p><p>The next chop, only one thing dropped this time.</p><p></p><p>[Magic Weapon: Pure Heart Jade Pendant (Fragment)]</p><p></p><p>[A fragment of the magic weapon Pure Heart Jade Pendant. Wearing it can reduce distracting thoughts, calm the mind, resist illusory powers, and make the heart as clear as ice]</p><p></p><p>Magic weapons are high-grade goods, and their fragments are also treasures. Zhou Qing won't mind having more.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing happily started munching on the sunflower seeds. Special energy surged into his flesh and internal energy, rapidly increasing Zhou Qing's strength.</p><p></p><p>Eating sunflower seeds can make one stronger. Who knows how others cultivate?</p><p></p><p>In the morning, after arriving at the martial arts hall, Zhou Qing's respected Senior Sister didn't wait for Zhou Qing to speak and took the initiative to touch Zhou Qing again.</p><p></p><p>Well, the quantity increased again and became harder again.</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister was a bit numb.</p><p></p><p>"Bang! Bang!"</p><p></p><p>After cultivating peacefully in the martial arts hall for a day, it was deep into the night again.</p><p></p><p>In the secret realm, Zhou Qing chopped twice this time, transforming into a ruthless tree-chopping machine.</p><p></p><p>These trees, the more you chop, the fewer there are. Zhou Qing was counting on his fingers how much time he had left and couldn't bear to waste a single time.</p><p></p><p>Two consecutive chops, three things dropped, which was not bad.</p><p></p><p>[Weapon Material: Silver Essence]</p><p></p><p>[Forging material, can be crafted into weapons by skilled artisans]</p><p></p><p>[Low-grade Soul Plant: Soul Nourishing Grass]</p><p></p><p>[Can nourish the soul and enhance the power of the soul]</p><p></p><p>[Low-grade Soul Plant: Poison Soul Grass]</p><p></p><p>[Contains poison of the soul, can poison one's soul. If not detoxified, after half an hour, the soul will dissipate. Its roots and stems, when burned, become the antidote]</p><p></p><p>These two tree chops actually dropped things Zhou Qing had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>Weapon materials and soul plants!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing examined the Silver Essence in front of him. It was a good thing, but unfortunately, he couldn't use it, so he put it away.</p><p></p><p>As for the two soul plants, they were interesting. One nourished the soul, and the other poisoned the soul!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing pondered for a while, both were very useful to him.</p><p></p><p>Profit!</p><p></p><p>After eating the Soul Nourishing Grass and meditating for a while, his soul realm expanded again.</p><p></p><p>In the morning, Zhou Qing and the others gathered at the entrance of Taibai Martial Arts Hall.</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian was going to Black Mountain during the day, and the disciples came to see him off.</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian instructed some matters and finally said to Zhou Qing, "In the days when I'm not here, don't slack off. When I come back, I will test you."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Master."</p><p></p><p>"On this trip to Black Mountain, I will pay attention to the existence of spiritual plants. If I find any, I will bring them back to help you improve your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts hall will be taken care of by you fellow disciples."</p><p></p><p>Master, don't say anymore. At times like this, the more you say, the more it feels like flag-raising. I'm really afraid.</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian left, and not far away, an old and a young were already waiting.</p><p></p><p>"Where are the others?" Bai Tian asked.</p><p></p><p>Meng Hao shook his head, "The other two hall masters refused me, saying they were too busy to spare time. For this trip to Black Mountain, there are only the three of us."</p><p></p><p>"That's fine too."</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian nodded, three...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He didn't care whether it was one person or five people.</p><p></p><p>As long as Mr. Mu was there, it would be fine.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Meng Hao glanced in the direction of Taibai Martial Arts Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Hall Master Bai has truly taken in a good disciple," Meng Hao said inexplicably.</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian smiled, "Each of them is quite good."</p><p></p><p>Just now, Mu Bo had telepathically told Meng Hao that the person who had encountered ghosts back then was now a martial artist, and his progress was not slow.</p><p></p><p>With such talent, it could be considered excellent. Plus, considering what happened before, Meng Hao found Zhou Qing quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>Watching the three leave, Zhou Qing curiously asked, "Who are the other two?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, they seem to be young masters and bodyguards from out of town," Bai Ruoyue shook her head. "They wanted to enter Black Mountain and asked my father to be their guide. I don't know why he agreed."</p><p></p><p>The more Zhou Qing heard, the more ominous he felt. Outsiders, entering Black Mountain, acting as a guide.</p><p></p><p>Why did this give him a strange sense of déjà vu?</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing asked again, "Besides beasts, what else is inside Black Mountain? Will it threaten Master?"</p><p></p><p>"Legend has it that the Mountain God lives in Black Mountain."</p><p></p><p>"But there shouldn't be anything that can threaten Master, right?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Yu had a beautiful appearance and a graceful figure, giving off the feeling of a small family's jade.</p><p></p><p>"Mountain God?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing recalled the original's memories and found that there were indeed legends about the Mountain God circulating in Heiyun Town.</p><p></p><p>Not only the Mountain God, but there were also legends of the Yunjiang Dragon Lord!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing felt that in such a transcendent world, the Mountain God and Dragon Lord might not be fake.</p><p></p><p>"Black Mountain is a place you will have to go in the future as well," Bai Ruoyue said.</p><p></p><p>"Martial artists can't just train behind closed doors. They need the tempering of real battles. The beasts in Black Mountain are good opponents."</p><p></p><p>"If advanced students don't want to pay tuition to continue staying at the martial arts hall, then they need to regularly enter Black Mountain under the hall's organization to hunt beasts."</p><p></p><p>"The beasts they hunt are their tuition."</p><p></p><p>"Beasts, huh..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing wanted to witness them.</p><p></p><p>His inner energy was ready to erupt, and his physical body was already hungry and thirsty!</p><p></p><p>Working hard on cultivation these past two days had led to considerable progress in his strength.</p><p></p><p>After lunch, Zhou Qing informed Bai Ruoyue that he was going to leave the martial arts hall for a bit.</p><p></p><p>"You have something to do?"</p><p></p><p>"I still haven't fixed the door at my house..." Zhou Qing felt helpless. He had been living a doorless life these past few days.</p><p></p><p>"..." Bai Ruoyue agreed.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing first took care of the door matter, then left town and arrived at the edge of the Yunjiang River.</p><p></p><p>Because of Bai Tian's departure, Zhou Qing was reminded of something - he hadn't tested the ability of the Avoid Water Pearl fragment yet, so he took this opportunity to try it out.</p><p></p><p>This was Zhou Qing's first time at the Yunjiang River. He saw the surging water, the magnificent waves, flowing vastly into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing looked left and right. No one was around.</p><p></p><p>"Splash!"</p><p></p><p>The most amazing thing was that Zhou Qing's clothes didn't get wet. Moreover, under the water, Zhou Qing was actually still breathing!</p><p></p><p>It was as if there was an invisible barrier separating the river water, creating a waterless area. Additionally, Zhou Qing had none of the fear humans have towards deep water.</p><p></p><p>This was the effect of the Avoid Water Pearl fragment. Zhou Qing was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the blue light emitting Avoid Water Pearl in his hand, Zhou Qing suddenly felt that the light seemed to have dimmed a bit.</p><p></p><p>"This should be the time limit. When the blue light completely disappears, the Avoid Water Pearl will temporarily become unusable," Zhou Qing pondered.</p><p></p><p>This was the flaw of magic tool fragments. If it were a complete Avoid Water Pearl, repelling mortal water would basically have no consumption.</p><p></p><p>For the following period of time, Zhou Qing kept moving about under the Yunjiang River, wanting to see the limits of the Avoid Water Pearl fragment.</p><p></p><p>Smoothly swimming around, transforming into a white strip in the waves, Zhou Qing also saw various aquatic animals and some plants.</p><p></p><p>Wherever Zhou Qing passed, fish and shrimp would hurriedly scatter. The Yunjiang "tyrant" indeed.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? What's that?"</p><p></p><p>At one moment, Zhou Qing discovered a shining aquatic grass on some silt.</p><p></p><p>Getting closer, Zhou Qing froze.</p><p></p><p>This thing seemed like the spirit plant he had eaten before.</p><p></p><p>It's just that this was the aquatic plant version.</p><p></p><p>"There are spirit plants in both Black Mountain and under the Yunjiang River..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing recalled what Bai Ruoyue had said before and confirmed the identity of this aquatic grass.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but reveal a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, people who love to smile never have too bad of luck.</p><p></p><p>This spirit plant has a fateful connection with me!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing approached the spirit plant, but just as he got close, the water currents suddenly surged.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>A long shadow shot towards Zhou Qing!</p><p></p><p>Wow, an ambush!</p>

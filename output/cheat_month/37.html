            <p>Chapter 37: Further Teachings</p><p></p><p>Riding on a donkey and escorting a person, Zhou Qing and Yun Duo headed towards Heiyun Town.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing, you're so amazing. None of the other martial artists I've seen are as good as you," Yun Duo said curiously, her steps light and quick. "That was Daoist magic. How did you break it?"</p><p></p><p>"It might be because martial artists have an advantage over Daoist priests," Zhou Qing said vaguely.</p><p></p><p>"Martial artists can overcome the Daoist magic cast by priests?" Yun Duo was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The advantage martial artists have over priests refers to the suppression of souls by their yang energy and blood, but the Daoist magic cast by priests is different.</p><p></p><p>Not all Daoist magic is yin-based.</p><p></p><p>"Yun Duo, do you know about the art of animal transformation?" Zhou Qing changed the subject.</p><p></p><p>"Never heard of it," Yun Duo shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like we need to go back and ask Aunt Mo."</p><p></p><p>The wandering Daoist priest couldn't solve the art of animal transformation either.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing had carefully interrogated him and understood his situation.</p><p></p><p>This wandering Daoist priest was originally just a Contemplation Realm cultivator living in Tianyue County City.</p><p></p><p>But some time ago, someone approached him, helped him break through to the Out-of-Body Realm, and taught him the art of animal transformation, asking him to come to the Heiyun Town area to look for human-beasts.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the art of animal transformation is quite profound, and the wandering Daoist priest hadn't fully mastered it. To successfully cast it, he still had to rely on that wooden donkey figurine.</p><p></p><p>First, he would take the blood of a live donkey and smear it on the wooden figurine, then extract the soul of the live donkey and seal it in the figurine. After that, he could chant incantations to activate the magic and turn people into donkeys.</p><p></p><p>The wandering Daoist priest could only use the wooden figurine to cast the spell, but he didn't know how to undo it.</p><p></p><p>This wandering Daoist's skills were not even as good as Huang Shiren's back then. Huang Shiren at least knew how to control ghosts and had a soul sword.</p><p></p><p>Even the Out-of-Body Realm was useless. Under the scorching sun, souls that left the body would die even faster.</p><p></p><p>Who was behind him? That information couldn't be extracted.</p><p></p><p>Entering Heiyun Town, Zhou Qing and Yun Duo sent the dozen or so donkeys transformed from living people and the wandering Daoist priest to the garrison office, then headed straight for the peach grove to tell Lu Qingmo about the art of animal transformation.</p><p></p><p>"The art of animal transformation?" Lu Qingmo's eyes narrowed. "This is no ordinary Daoist magic. It actually appeared in Heiyun Town."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Lu Qingmo closed her eyes. A few breaths later, she opened her eyes again, as if sensing something.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed the real art of animal transformation, although somewhat incomplete, but it's not an ordinary illusion or delusion technique."</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Mo, can the art of animal transformation be undone?" Zhou Qing asked.</p><p></p><p>"It can be undone. Fortunately, this is not the complete art of animal transformation. Otherwise, if too much time passed, even gods and Buddhas couldn't save them, and they could only be donkeys for life."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingmo said, "In the future, if you encounter similar situations, you can first give the affected person clear water to drink."</p><p></p><p>"If it's just an ordinary illusion or delusion technique, a trick to deceive the common folk, clear water can break it."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing listened carefully to Lu Qingmo's words, learning another useful piece of knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingmo went into the attic and came out after a while, holding a yellow talisman in her hand.</p><p></p><p>"Burn the talisman paper into ashes, mix it with water, and feed it to those people. They will then regain their human form."</p><p></p><p>Water with added ingredients was needed to break the spell!</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Mo, isn't this art of animal transformation too terrifying? It can actually turn people into donkeys."</p><p></p><p>Transforming from one species to another, a true inside-out change, not just an illusion, was truly astonishing.</p><p></p><p>This was the magical Daoist magic.</p><p></p><p>"A complete art of animal transformation can do more than just turn people into donkeys. It can transform them into pigs, sheep, and other livestock as well."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingmo shook her head, "However, this technique is extremely difficult to use on cultivators, so there's no need to be too afraid."</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Mo, there are still people behind that Daoist priest. If they find out we caught him..."</p><p></p><p>"The people in the shadows wanted this pawn to be caught by us." Lu Qingmo</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A cold glint flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"An existence capable of forcefully helping others break through and bestowing the art of creating beasts, why would they need a wandering Taoist priest to collect human beasts for them!"</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry about what happens next. Your contributions will be recorded. Yunduo, go deliver the talisman first. Zhou Qing, stay for a moment."</p><p></p><p>Yunduo obediently nodded and left with the yellow talisman.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me in detail about your experience this time," Lu Qingmo said.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment, you're saying that you discovered the murderer was a cultivator, and those donkeys were transformed from living people?" Lu Qingmo interrupted Zhou Qing at one point.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Zhou Qing nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yunduo knows the art of spirit eye, she didn't discover it?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Zhou Qing was at a loss. "I didn't know she knew the art of spirit eye, she never mentioned it."</p><p></p><p>"Miss Yunduo probably forgot about it."</p><p></p><p>There was a rare hint of helplessness in Lu Qingmo's words. "Forgot... this is indeed her nature."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingmo personally confirmed it, so this Yunduo, was she really muddle-headed?</p><p></p><p>"Do you mind sharing how you discovered it?"</p><p></p><p>Since Bai Ruoyue said he could reveal some details to Lu Qingmo, Zhou Qing decided to continue showing some of his abilities to test Lu Qingmo's depth.</p><p></p><p>He decided to bring more of his talents to Taolin.</p><p></p><p>"Observing energy?" Lu Qingmo was surprised. "You actually awakened a postnatal talent?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this very rare?"</p><p></p><p>"This isn't a question of rarity, it's the kind that's very special."</p><p></p><p>"But it's a good thing that you can awaken this kind of ability, it further proves your talent." After some thought, Lu Qingmo said:</p><p></p><p>"You should have a few arts in your possession?"</p><p></p><p>"I have the arts of ghost control, dream illusion, and moon absorption."</p><p></p><p>They were all obtained from others.</p><p></p><p>The wandering Taoist priest had nothing else on him except for the wooden donkey figurine, he didn't originally have the beast creation art.</p><p></p><p>"Starting from tomorrow, I will guide you in cultivating these three arts."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was overjoyed in his heart. Auntie Mo was someone he could deal with, she was truly willing to reward him.</p><p></p><p>Initially, it was agreed that Lu Qingmo would teach Zhou Qing Taoist knowledge, but it did not include the specific cultivation of arts.</p><p></p><p>These three arts required Zhou Qing to master Taoist knowledge before learning them on his own.</p><p></p><p>By that time, Zhou Qing would definitely be able to learn them, but how could the learning efficiency compare to having someone guide him.</p><p></p><p>And by learning them ahead of time, he could enjoy the benefits earlier.</p><p></p><p>He profited.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Zhou Qing in front of her, Lu Qingmo became more and more surprised.</p><p></p><p>She really didn't expect that Heiyun Town could give birth to such a genius.</p><p></p><p>What virtue and ability did Bai Tianche have to take such a genius as his disciple?</p><p></p><p>It was simply as if his ancestral grave was emitting green smoke.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, the time you spend learning from me every day will be extended to one shichen (2 hours)."</p><p></p><p>"But remember, you must not neglect your martial arts cultivation either."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Clap clap clap!"</p><p></p><p>After finishing a set of punches, Bai Ruoyue glanced at Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>"Little junior brother, not seeing you for half a day, you've gotten bold."</p><p></p><p>"Hurry over and let me take a look at you."</p><p></p><p>This time it wasn't a morning grope, but a noon grope.</p><p></p><p>While being groped by Bai Ruoyue, Zhou Qing explained to her the reason why he only came to the martial arts hall today.</p><p></p><p>Removing her hands from Zhou Qing's body, Bai Ruoyue was very satisfied. </p><p></p><p>Very good, very strong, very much to my liking.</p><p></p><p>"So it was because Auntie Mo sent you out on a task, this is actually somewhat beneficial for you." Bai Ruoyue said:</p><p></p><p>"Remember, no matter what you do, prioritize your own safety."</p><p></p><p>"But this does remind me, when there's a chance, I'll take you out to enjoy yourself."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>This enjoyment, is it proper?</p>

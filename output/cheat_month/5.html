            <p>Chapter 5: I'm Not an Illiterate Martial Artist</p><p></p><p>Although he suspected that he was a genius in both body and comprehension, Zhou Qing still earnestly watched He Feng's teaching.</p><p></p><p>Just as He Feng had said to Li Wu, being a genius is not an excuse for you to slack off.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Bai Ruoyue and another female hall master disciple walked over and quietly called out to Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing, come with me."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing immediately followed.</p><p></p><p>The other female disciple began to teach Wang Taotao the Crane Form practice method.</p><p></p><p>The movements of Zhou Qing and Bai Ruoyue attracted the attention of the vast majority of people in this hall.</p><p></p><p>"That's the new apprentice, right? Instead of learning martial arts here, where is Teacher Bai taking him?"</p><p></p><p>"That seems to be the direction of the martial arts school's backyard. Hiss, that's a place where only the hall master's disciples can go!"</p><p></p><p>"What qualifications does he have as a new apprentice to go there?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was discussing, with all kinds of tones.</p><p></p><p>Originally, in their eyes, Zhou Qing was just an ordinary apprentice who was nothing special except for his handsome appearance. No one taught him practice methods, and the many apprentices didn't care at all.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, looking at Zhou Qing's back, the crowd suddenly felt that this person was no longer ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Bai Ruoyue didn't talk to Zhou Qing until they entered the backyard of the martial arts school, and only then did she speak.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing, your talent is very good, very suitable for practicing martial arts. Now it seems that age will not limit you."</p><p></p><p>"At the time of registration, I was... presumptuous and spoke too much."</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue's cheeks were slightly red, and she was a little embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was slightly stunned, not expecting that Bai Ruoyue, a martial artist, would say such apologetic words to him.</p><p></p><p>This person is really good.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing smiled and replied, "I know that Teacher Bai's words were for my own good."</p><p></p><p>"But why didn't Teacher Bai persuade me when I was registering my information?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue explained, "At that time, I didn't understand your family situation and thought you were a young master from a wealthy family."</p><p></p><p>If a young adult from a poor background came to learn martial arts, Bai Ruoyue would still persuade them, but if it was some rich young master, Bai Ruoyue naturally wouldn't say an extra word.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts school also needs to make a living.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing secretly nodded. This Bai Ruoyue is meticulous.</p><p></p><p>"You just saw the fist teaching by Junior Brother He." Bai Ruoyue said, "I don't know if the martial arts of my Taibai Martial Arts School meet your expectations?"</p><p></p><p>"It's truly a peerless divine skill." Zhou Qing answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>I've only seen this one kind of martial art, so there's no problem calling it a peerless divine skill, right?</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue rolled her eyes where Zhou Qing couldn't see.</p><p></p><p>"The three practice methods of my Taibai Martial Arts School are absolutely top-notch martial arts in this Black Cloud Town." Bai Ruoyue said,</p><p></p><p>"You have just come into contact with martial arts, so it's normal to have things you don't understand. There's no need to worry."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhou Qing struggled for a while, but finally decided to tell the truth.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Bai, I seem to have completely memorized the Bull Form practice method."</p><p></p><p>"You really memorized it?"</p><p></p><p>This wasn't said by Bai Ruoyue, but by a middle-aged man who suddenly appeared in the backyard.</p><p></p><p>This middle-aged man was dressed in black robes, tall in stature, with a resolute face, and had some resemblance to Bai Ruoyue in his brows and eyes.</p><p></p><p>The hall master of Taibai Martial Arts School - Bai Tian.</p><p></p><p>"Dad."</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian glanced at his daughter, "How many times have I said to address by title in public."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Dad." Bai Ruoyue was very "obedient".</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian couldn't do much about his daughter and looked at Zhou Qing again, "Is what you just said all true?"</p><p></p><p>"I have indeed memorized the Bull Form practice method."</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue felt surprised beside them.</p><p></p><p>The body is the body, but learning depends more on comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian spoke, "Good, come and demonstrate it once."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing found a spot, recalling the Bull Form that He Feng had demonstrated, and took a stance.</p><p></p><p>Then his footsteps began to move, his arms stretched out, striking horizontally in all directions, his body coordinating accordingly, looking like an ancient bull.</p><p></p><p>The Bull Form practice method in Zhou Qing's hands naturally didn't have the imposing manner of He Feng, but Zhou Qing's performance was quite smooth, and every move was without much error.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue was already shocked, while Bai Tian looked quite calm.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad."</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian uttered two words, then suddenly appeared beside Zhou Qing and placed a hand on Zhou Qing's body, pinching it.</p><p></p><p>After personally examining Zhou Qing's bone structure, Bai Tian was very satisfied in his heart. It was even better than what his daughter had said.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your martial arts talent can be considered excellent," Bai Tian warned.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your guidance, Headmaster." Zhou Qing took Bai Tian's words to heart. He understood these principles, having lived two lifetimes.</p><p></p><p>"Yue'er, take Zhou Qing to the lecture hall first."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was stunned. Is that it?</p><p></p><p>He was specially called here, his talent was tested, and the next step should be the apprenticeship ceremony, right?</p><p></p><p>Come on, Headmaster, am I not good enough for you with these qualifications?</p><p></p><p>The lecture hall looked somewhat similar to the classrooms from Zhou Qing's previous life.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue found a few books and placed them in front of Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Bai, are you going to teach me to read and write?"</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I'm literate. When my parents were still alive in my childhood, they hired a tutor for me."</p><p></p><p>Regardless of which world Zhou Qing was in, he was not illiterate.</p><p></p><p>"It's even better if you're literate," Bai Ruoyue said.</p><p></p><p>"But you still need to continue learning."</p><p></p><p>"Basically, all martial arts include martial arts principles and some special terms."</p><p></p><p>"If you don't study, when you're given a martial arts manual in the future, even if you recognize every character, when they're combined together, you won't be able to understand it at all."</p><p></p><p>"If you can't even understand martial arts manuals, how can you talk about practicing martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing suddenly realized and understood Bai Ruoyue's profound meaning.</p><p></p><p>There are illiterate top-tier celebrities, but there are definitely no illiterate martial arts masters.</p><p></p><p>Now, the teachers in the martial arts hall will teach you every move of the fist techniques hand by hand, and you just need to follow along, but this is not a long-term plan.</p><p></p><p>If you want to go further in the martial arts path, you must also have sufficient cultural knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Picking up a martial arts manual and becoming a master, unless that manual can automatically make you understand the relevant knowledge, otherwise it's just picking up a few pieces of scrap paper.</p><p></p><p>"Illiterates" are not worthy of becoming masters.</p><p></p><p>"To practice martial arts, you must first have an understanding of various aspects of the human body..."</p><p></p><p>Meridians, acupoints, some highly professional terms, it was the first time Zhou Qing had heard of them, the first time he understood them, it was eye-opening.</p><p></p><p>Putting aside those distracting thoughts, Zhou Qing eagerly sought knowledge from Bai Ruoyue like a hungry person.</p><p></p><p>This is a world with an ancient environment, and Zhou Qing, who came from Earth, can be said to understand the importance of learning more than the vast majority of people.</p><p></p><p>This is a concept and way of thinking cultivated from a young age, a stark difference between modern and ancient times.</p><p></p><p>As for becoming the headmaster's disciple, Zhou Qing was not in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>His current treatment was clearly different from other apprentices, indicating that the headmaster had plans for him.</p><p></p><p>Whether they were ordinary apprentices or advanced apprentices, they were only taught a specific martial art hand by hand. The martial arts hall was not responsible for teaching martial arts principles, regardless of whether you were "illiterate" or not.</p><p></p><p>This was only the second day after his transmigration, there was still time.</p><p></p><p>And Zhou Qing's attitude also made Bai Ruoyue secretly nod in approval.</p><p></p><p>Excellent foundation, outstanding comprehension, and the ability to settle down and learn.</p><p></p><p>He was truly a piece of fine jade, and she grew increasingly fond of him.</p><p></p><p>Don't misunderstand, it's not the fondness between a man and a woman, but the fondness for a junior martial brother.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Third floor of Taibai Martial Arts Hall.</p><p></p><p>This martial arts hall was not small, with a total of three floors and a large backyard.</p><p></p><p>The third floor was where the headmaster's disciples stayed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Bai Tian appeared here, and one of his disciples was talking beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the situation of the apprentice named Zhou Qing has been investigated."</p><p></p><p>"His parents died in an accident six years ago, and he has been living alone for six years without developing any bad habits."</p><p></p><p>"The neighbors also have a very good opinion of him, saying that he is an honest and sincere person without any problems."</p><p></p><p>This disciple also mentioned some other details about Zhou Qing, including the matter with Huang Shiren. Bai Tian nodded.</p><p></p><p>With Zhou Qing's talent, Bai Tian was naturally tempted, but the reason he didn't immediately accept Zhou Qing as his disciple was because Bai Tian had a rule for accepting disciples.</p><p></p><p>His disciples must have good character.</p><p></p><p>Not only looking at talent but also at character.</p><p></p><p>This was also the fundamental reason why the disciples Zhou Qing encountered in the martial arts hall were all quite responsible and why Taibai Martial Arts Hall had the best reputation.</p><p></p><p>When the upper beam is straight, the lower beam will naturally not be crooked.</p><p></p><p>However, this approach also led to Taibai Martial Arts Hall losing several talented individuals.</p><p></p><p>But Bai Tian's disciples naturally supported his approach. No one wanted to be martial brothers with someone of bad character.</p><p></p><p>Even bad people want to be friends with good people.</p>

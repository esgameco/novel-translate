            <p>Chapter 40: Hidden Jade (Please keep reading!)</p><p></p><p>In the Yun River below the Black Cloud Town, there were very few savage beasts comparable to the Tendon Realm.</p><p></p><p>With Zhou Qing's strength, he might not be invincible underwater, but he could come and go as he pleased.</p><p></p><p>Even if he really encountered a Tendon Realm savage beast, to be honest, Zhou Qing was not afraid.</p><p></p><p>The shrimp soldiers and crab generals told Zhou Qing about three resource points, two of which contained spiritual plants that were extremely hidden and undiscovered by beasts. Zhou Qing directly obtained them with ease.</p><p></p><p>However, at the third resource point, there was actually a skeleton and a lotus root-like spiritual plant.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing scratched his head, not expecting that the nonsense he had made up with Bai Ruoyue and the others had actually come true.</p><p></p><p>But Zhou Qing's vigilance was also at its highest.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, a pair of blood-red eyes lit up beside the lotus root. As the water surged, a crocodile more than ten meters long appeared in front of Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's heart tightened, and his spiritual perception was jumping, reminding him that the crocodile in front of him was not simple.</p><p></p><p>This was most likely a very rare crocodile in the Tendon Realm!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing cursed his bad luck. The shrimp soldiers and crab generals had mentioned this crocodile in their information, but they said that this crocodile was only in the Flesh Realm.</p><p></p><p>If the shrimp soldiers and crab generals were not lying, then it meant that this crocodile had broken through later.</p><p></p><p>The large crocodile opened its bloody mouth and charged straight at Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>For savage beasts, unless they encounter a creature that they instinctively fear, they will not back down. They will only choose to tear apart everything in front of them, being extremely stubborn.</p><p></p><p>From a long distance away, Zhou Qing could smell the fishy stench from the crocodile's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Damn thing, no, crocodile thing, you should brush your teeth!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing, holding the fragments of his weapon, did not immediately run away.</p><p></p><p>What kind of strength did a Tendon Realm warrior have? He had felt it when practicing with his senior brothers, and the strength of the disciples of Taibai was definitely considered excellent among their peers.</p><p></p><p>With his means, he might not be unable to fight this crocodile.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation was like this. The stronger one broke through each time, the greater the improvement they would gain, and the benefits they obtained far exceeded those of the weaker.</p><p></p><p>The strong grew stronger, and the weak grew weaker, an unchanging principle.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>The water currents surged, forming whirlpools. As the crocodile swung its tail, it brought up countless torrents.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing barely dodged the crocodile's bite and struck the crocodile's back with the handle of his spear, causing the crocodile to writhe in pain.</p><p></p><p>The huge body brought vigorous blood and powerful strength, but it also made it easier to become a target.</p><p></p><p>It was just that the defense of the crocodile's scales was also quite exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>"Poof!"</p><p></p><p>Despite dodging a hundred times, Zhou Qing was still hit by the crocodile's tail and was directly sent flying.</p><p></p><p>His blood surged and there was a vague sense of pain, fortunately, he had inner armor to buffer.</p><p></p><p>The crocodile entangled him again, and this time Zhou Qing directly swam nimbly onto its back. As the crocodile rolled, Zhou Qing also rolled with it, constantly bombarding the savage beast.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, when hit by the crocodile's tail, Zhou Qing would tightly grasp the crocodile's feet to stabilize his posture and prevent himself from being slapped away.</p><p></p><p>The crocodile became more and more frenzied, going berserk at the bottom of the water, even rushing into the silt at the bottom of the river, trying to use the rocks on both sides to drive Zhou Qing off.</p><p></p><p>But how could Zhou Qing be injured by such tactics?</p><p></p><p>The biggest difference between humans and savage beasts was intelligence!</p><p></p><p>Beasts were just beasts. Even mortals could use their intelligence to hunt various fierce beasts, let alone Zhou Qing, who possessed no small amount of strength and had more room to maneuver.</p><p></p><p>The crocodile's huge body allowed it to be tyrannical in this river domain, with few opponents, but at this time, facing the "small" human, this body size instead became a burden.</p><p></p><p>The more it struggled, the faster it consumed its own strength. Even the sturdy scales under the bombardment of the weapon fragments...</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Zhou Qing found the right opportunity. As the crocodile beast opened its mouth wide, he poured out his overwhelming spiritual power, striking the crocodile.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he activated the ability to control ordinary water, which he had gained from upgrading the shattered Water Avoidance Pearl, restricting the water flow around the crocodile and making it sluggish for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing took the shattered gun barrel and ruthlessly stabbed it into the crocodile beast's gaping bloody mouth, deep into its throat, and then fiercely stirred it a few times.</p><p></p><p>Deep throat!</p><p></p><p>Beast blood instantly flowed out, staining a large area of water red. The crocodile beast was in excruciating pain and its body thrashed violently.</p><p></p><p>The immense force from the crocodile beneath was transmitted. Zhou Qing gripped the gun with both hands, no longer lying on the crocodile's body. While swimming nimbly, he directly pulled the gun out a section, then heavily stabbed it in again.</p><p></p><p>One step to the stomach!</p><p></p><p>At this point, the outcome was decided. The severely wounded crocodile could no longer make any waves and couldn't even escape if it wanted to.</p><p></p><p>Who says you can't kill someone without a spearhead!</p><p></p><p>It can be said that such a beast is much easier to deal with than a Meridian Realm warrior.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing didn't delay. He immediately went down to pick that lotus root spirit plant, took the white bones, and dragged the crocodile beast's corpse upstream on the river surface.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, look, there's a crocodile in the sky!" </p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing, who had surfaced, shouted. While Bai Ruoyue looked up, he flung the beast's corpse into the sky, splashing water everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The spectacle of a crocodile in the sky was achieved!</p><p></p><p>"This is a Meridian Realm aquatic beast?!" Bai Ruoyue was startled. "Zhou Qing, you've gotten bold, haven't you, daring to provoke this kind of beast?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, I didn't provoke it, it wanted to provoke me."</p><p></p><p>"This is what I found at the bottom of the water, but these white bones don't seem to be human bones?"</p><p></p><p>The white skeleton had a long tail bone between its legs, three long and sharp finger bones on each hand, and a upward-curving, horn-like cyan bone at the brow.</p><p></p><p>This was clearly not human.</p><p></p><p>"This should be the remains left behind by a demon after its death," Bai Ruoyue said.</p><p></p><p>"Demon?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing bent down to take a closer look at the seventh rib of this skeleton.</p><p></p><p>Only under the sun did he discover that this seventh rib was different from the other bones, faintly emitting a cyan light.</p><p></p><p>When underwater, neither the naked eye nor spiritual power inspection had detected the difference in this bone.</p><p></p><p>"Did you find anything else next to the skeleton?"</p><p></p><p>"Nothing at all."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing shook his head. He had carefully inspected - one set of bones, one lotus root, and nothing else.</p><p></p><p>"Empty!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing reached out and tapped the seven ribs, finding to his surprise that it was hollow, which was unexpected. He tried the other bones and they were all different from that rib.</p><p></p><p>"Could there be something inside?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing thought for a moment and extended his spiritual power to touch the seventh rib. Before he could continue probing inside, he saw cyan light permeating the rib. A square jade actually ejected from the rib and fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the rib again, its color was now no different from the other bones.</p><p></p><p>"Could this be..."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the square cyan jade, a term emerged in Zhou Qing's mind.</p><p></p><p>Jade slip?</p><p></p><p>He was familiar with this thing!</p><p></p><p>A new week, a new round of recommendations.

            <p>Chapter 12: The Night Yaksha Visualization Method</p><p></p><p>"Hiss~ Ha~ Oh~ Ah~"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing made strange sounds as he approached the corpse of Huang Shiren.</p><p></p><p>There was no other way, he was truly in pain now.</p><p></p><p>During the battle, he had entered a peculiar state, not feeling any pain.</p><p></p><p>After the battle, when he saw the cruel scenes, the mental shock temporarily shielded him from the physical pain.</p><p></p><p>But now, as he came back to his senses and some thoughts dissipated, the sword wounds on his body made Zhou Qing gasp for air.</p><p></p><p>In both his lifetimes combined, this was the first time he had been cut by a sword.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Zhou Qing felt that his master had a really big heart, watching him get cut without fear of him making a mistake and getting sliced to death.</p><p></p><p>And this, was the life of a warrior.</p><p></p><p>Fighting was something that permeated a warrior's entire life.</p><p></p><p>Bai Tianle was happy to see Zhou Qing experience the taste of battle early on.</p><p></p><p>And Zhou Qing's performance made Bai Tian even more pleasantly surprised.</p><p></p><p>A genius, truly a genius.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he wouldn't be able to see this disciple's most peak state of innate talent.</p><p></p><p>It was truly a big regret in life.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Huang Shiren's already split corpse, Zhou Qing's eyes were ice-cold, without a shred of sympathy. Seeing blood for the first time and killing such a beast, it was truly a meaningful thing.</p><p></p><p>"Letting you die so quickly, it's really letting you off easy."</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because he was already a warrior, Zhou Qing didn't have any special reaction to the blood all over the ground.</p><p></p><p>Bending down to loot the corpse, Zhou Qing didn't find any martial arts manuals or similar items on Huang Shiren's body. </p><p></p><p>Makes sense, who would carry martial arts manuals on them at home.</p><p></p><p>Finding nothing, Zhou Qing turned and left.</p><p></p><p>There were some gold, silver and jade items on Huang Shiren's body, but Zhou Qing didn't take a single one.</p><p></p><p>Picking up the precious sword from the ground, the blade reflected Zhou Qing's face, flashing with a cold light.</p><p></p><p>"Good sword!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing exclaimed in admiration. He didn't know much about swords, but he knew how sharp this blade was.</p><p></p><p>He had personally experienced it.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing decided to take this sword as his spoils of war.</p><p></p><p>After sheathing the sword, Zhou Qing went out again to look for Huang Shiren's room. He quickly found it and after some searching, found what he wanted.</p><p></p><p>Carrying his gains, Zhou Qing found Bai Tian and showed him.</p><p></p><p>"I see you seem quite interested in soul cultivation. Take it back and have a look."</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian was indeed very knowledgeable. </p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing happily pocketed it, then brought up another matter.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Huang Shiren has quite a fortune. I have an idea."</p><p></p><p>"After this matter is dealt with, could we take some of Huang Shiren's money to compensate the families of the victims?"</p><p></p><p>"If they haven't fallen victim to him yet..."</p><p></p><p>Huang Shiren had been in Black Cloud Town for three years, ruining who knows how many families, known only to him and his accomplices.</p><p></p><p>But Zhou Qing could imagine the despair of those families.</p><p></p><p>Giving them some of Huang Shiren's money could be considered a kind of compensation.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Zhou Qing would take a bit of this ill-gotten wealth, as he was dirt poor right now.</p><p></p><p>But Zhou Qing alone definitely couldn't take much, the vast majority still had to be left behind.</p><p></p><p>Using Huang Shiren's money to do good, Zhou Qing didn't feel bad about it.</p><p></p><p>As for whether Bai Tian would take any, that wasn't something Zhou Qing should ask about.</p><p></p><p>After punishing evil and eliminating harm, taking spoils of war was a rule even the authorities tacitly accepted.</p><p></p><p>"No problem." Bai Tian agreed to Zhou Qing's request, then glanced at him and said:</p><p></p><p>"You go to the martial arts hall first, have Ruyue get you some medicine for your wounds and change your clothes."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was reminded of his injuries again and started gasping. He bid farewell to Bai Tian and hurriedly ran towards the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, a warrior's body was resilient, otherwise he would have long fainted from blood loss.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the martial arts hall, Bai Ruyue was startled seeing Zhou Qing's appearance. Zhou Qing also looked to be in a great hurry, making her think he was being chased.</p><p></p><p>Before Zhou Qing could explain, she had already...</p><p></p><p>He also called over his martial brothers from the martial arts school.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing didn't know whether to laugh or cry. With great difficulty, he finally explained it clearly, and then with everyone's help, he applied the medicine.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, this healing medicine worked very well. When applied to the wound, it felt cool, numb and very comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Bai Ruoyue asked Zhou Qing to stay overnight at the martial arts school, but Zhou Qing refused, insisting on going home. Unable to persuade Zhou Qing, Bai Ruoyue personally escorted Zhou Qing back.</p><p></p><p>However, when they arrived at the entrance of Zhou Qing's home, Bai Ruoyue's gaze towards Zhou Qing was a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>The corner of Zhou Qing's mouth twitched.</p><p></p><p>He would have to fix the door later, what a nuisance.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue left without going in with Zhou Qing. She told Zhou Qing to recuperate well and not overexert himself.</p><p></p><p>Back in his own room, Zhou Qing poured a glass of water and sat quietly in a chair, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>In the short time since he had crossed over, he had experienced too many things.</p><p></p><p>Last night he faced ghosts, during the day he faced people, and in the evening he faced beasts.</p><p></p><p>At three points in time, Zhou Qing felt completely different atmospheres.</p><p></p><p>His first enemy since crossing over had also died, killed by his own hands.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing suddenly smiled. Could this be considered upholding justice?</p><p></p><p>He thought it would be a villain that he would have to work hard for a while to defeat, but unexpectedly it turned out to be just a small fry.</p><p></p><p>After calming his mind, Zhou Qing shook his head and took out the spoils he had obtained from Huang Shiren, two paper-based secret manuals.</p><p></p><p>"Night Yaksha Visualization Method"</p><p></p><p>"Ghost Control Technique"</p><p></p><p>This was all Zhou Qing's gains in soul cultivation this time.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing first took a look at the "Ghost Control Technique". As the name suggests, it records the techniques for controlling ghosts for one's own use.</p><p></p><p>This technique itself is not an evil art, it all depends on the user.</p><p></p><p>However, while Zhou Qing understood the use of this "Ghost Control Technique", there were still some parts of the cultivation method that he didn't quite understand.</p><p></p><p>The terminology used in those parts was quite professional, and Zhou Qing hadn't learned it before...</p><p></p><p>This was very realistic.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing opened the other secret manual and after a quick glance, he immediately became engrossed.</p><p></p><p>If the Ghost Control Technique is equivalent to the fighting methods in martial arts, then this Visualization Method is the practice method, used to improve the realm of the soul!</p><p></p><p>Through this scroll of the Night Yaksha Visualization Method, Zhou Qing finally gained some understanding of soul cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The Sensing Stage he was in now was actually a preparatory stage similar to nourishing life in martial arts, and did not yet count as truly entering the threshold of being a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The Sensing Stage is the process of living beings eliminating distracting thoughts, meditating to invigorate the spirit, seeking a glimmer of spiritual light in the mysterious void, and ultimately sensing the existence of one's own soul realm.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the Sensing Stage, although not yet a true cultivator, one's mental strength is also enhanced and can resist the illusions of ordinary ghostly beings.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing, having consumed the Source of Life, had a strengthened soul and his mental strength had already reached a peak stage.</p><p></p><p>Just like the physical body, before entering the realm, the spirit could be comparable to cultivators who have just started on the path of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He was a genius in both body and soul, code name, uh, no code name.</p><p></p><p>Later, due to the strengthening of that spiritual soul power, he naturally sensed his own soul realm.</p><p></p><p>After sensing the soul realm, one must begin to visualize, imagining various things within the soul realm. After succeeding, one can truly embark on the path of a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Huang Shiren was a cultivator at the Visualization Stage, and what he cultivated was the Night Yaksha Visualization Method.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhou Qing had mixed feelings.</p><p></p><p>He was happy that he knew how to cultivate the soul and that he could understand the cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>He was worried that this Visualization Method might not be of high quality.</p><p></p><p>Compared to martial arts, if this was a secret martial arts level Visualization Method, it might have been Zhou Qing who was taken down in the earlier battle.</p><p></p><p>At Huang Shiren's age, he was still at the Visualization Stage, so the technique he cultivated naturally couldn't be very good.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's soul talent was not bad. If he casually cultivated this kind of Visualization Chart, it would definitely affect his future.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing pondered in his heart and made a decision.</p><p></p><p>Why not ask the amazing Daoist Priest Bai?</p>

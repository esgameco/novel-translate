            <p>Chapter 19: The Daily Moment of Nonsense</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing and Yang Xing were in a standoff.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's strangeness made Yang Xing very wary.</p><p></p><p>Although he had slashed Zhou Qing with his blade, the other party had inner armor, and with their strength, he knew that Zhou Qing had not yet lost his combat power.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Wang Er's life and death were uncertain, and Wang Da was obviously more concerned about his own brother.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Wang Da was seen picking up Wang Er, glaring at Zhou Qing with hatred, not saying a word, and running straight towards Heiyun Town.</p><p></p><p>Between saving Wang Er's life and continuing to surround Zhou Qing, he chose the former.</p><p></p><p>The departure of the Wang brothers made Yang Xing's face look even worse as he stared at Zhou Qing, a fierce light suddenly flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, I can't even take down an injured person?"</p><p></p><p>"The blade is also damaged, just in time for some things to make up for my loss!"</p><p></p><p>Yang Xing made up his mind and charged forward again.</p><p></p><p>This time facing only one opponent, Zhou Qing was not afraid at all.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps his combat experience was not very rich, but Zhou Qing fought more fiercely and without any reservations!</p><p></p><p>In terms of weapons, he had the advantage; Yang Xing didn't dare to directly block the eagle beak spear shaft.</p><p></p><p>As for defense, he had inner armor while Yang Xing did not.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing could fight with abandon, while in contrast, Yang Xing, who was two realms higher than Zhou Qing, was somewhat restrained and extremely frustrated.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing dared to risk his life to take another slash from him, but he didn't dare to take a single blow from Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>Those who don't fear death are the most terrifying!</p><p></p><p>After a bout of entanglement, seeing Yang Xing's gradually slowing offensive, Zhou Qing was also reaching his limit.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's inner qi had long been exhausted, and at this point, he was fighting purely with physical strength.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, when Yang Xing's attack fell empty, Zhou Qing used his long-hidden spiritual power to impact Yang Xing's head.</p><p></p><p>The long battle had left Yang Xing far from his peak, and at this moment, he experienced a slight daze. Although he immediately returned to normal, what shocked him was that the staff was whistling towards him, already at close range!</p><p></p><p>Yang Xing tried to twist his body, but in the end, he was a step too late and couldn't completely dodge.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The staff fiercely slapped Yang Xing's right shoulder, and he howled, falling directly to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing pressed his advantage, striking down with another blow. Yang Xing rolled and crawled to avoid it, then, without even looking at Zhou Qing, he dragged his right arm and ran.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing also ran, but he wasn't chasing Yang Xing. Instead, he ran towards Taibai Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>Chasing down Yang Xing to kill him? How many dishes would have such an idea?</p><p></p><p>Yang Xing's flesh and blood were greatly intact, and his inner qi was who knows how many times deeper than Zhou Qing's. It definitely wasn't exhausted.</p><p></p><p>With his heart set on escaping, Zhou Qing definitely couldn't catch up to him.</p><p></p><p>Of the thirty-six stratagems, fleeing is the best.</p><p></p><p>Return to the martial hall first and talk later!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing quickly returned to Taibai Martial Hall without being stopped by people from Tenglong Martial Hall along the way.</p><p></p><p>"Little junior brother, what happened to you?!!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the blood-covered Zhou Qing rushed in, he was seen by Bai Ruoyue, who was sitting at the registration desk.</p><p></p><p>She cried out in alarm and rushed over.</p><p></p><p>"I found a spirit plant in Yunjiang, then ran into people from Tenglong Martial Hall. They wanted to snatch my spirit plant..."</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue was furious, her face flushed with anger.</p><p></p><p>"They snatched your spirit plant and beat you up like this? Are they looking down on Taibai Martial Hall for having no one?!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior sister, the spirit plant wasn't taken. I kept it safe."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing took out the spirit plant and snake corpse hidden in his clothes and handed them to Bai Ruoyue.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue didn't take them, but directly supported Zhou Qing and walked towards the back courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Even if the spirit plant was kept safe, this matter can't be settled like this. They actually went so hard against you. This isn't over!"</p><p></p><p>In the back courtyard, the other senior brothers were also alarmed. Upon learning of Zhou Qing's experience, they were both shocked and angry, cursing Tenglong Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>"What a Tenglong Martial Hall, to actually be so heavy-handed against little junior brother who has only cultivated for four days..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Hand!" Zhang Yuantao's expression was ice-cold.</p><p></p><p>"This grudge must be avenged!"</p><p></p><p>While cursing the other party, Bai Ruoyue and the others did not forget about Zhou Qing. They found healing medicines, both for internal and external use, and applied them to Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's blood-stained clothes were stripped off, exposing his Hundred Refined Inner Armor.</p><p></p><p>After equipping the dropped items through body fusion, no one could currently see them, like the pair of Hundred Refined Gloves. Throughout the battle, Yang Xing didn't even notice them.</p><p></p><p>However, when Zhou Qing directly took Yang Xing's slash, this inner armor could no longer be concealed, so exposing it directly was the best choice at this time.</p><p></p><p>Among these dropped items, weapon-type items were relatively special. They couldn't be hidden or equipped through body fusion.</p><p></p><p>For example, if Zhou Qing chose to equip the Eagle Beak Spear's shaft through body fusion, how would he use the spear shaft to fight?</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this item could only be exposed on the outside.</p><p></p><p>The exposure of the Hundred Refined Inner Armor also surprised Bai Ruoyue and the others.</p><p></p><p>"When I went down to the Yun River, I discovered a corpse at the bottom of the river, along with spirit plants and these two weapons beside the corpse."</p><p></p><p>"When I took the items, this black snake rushed out to sneak attack me. I used this staff to kill the black snake. Fearing encounters with other fierce beasts, I also put on this inner armor."</p><p></p><p>"After I got ashore, I encountered people from the Soaring Dragon Martial Hall."</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue and the others looked at each other. Zhou Qing's experience seemed quite... legendary.</p><p></p><p>"Little junior brother has encountered an opportunity." Zhang Yuantao laughed:</p><p></p><p>"The Yun River is truly a treasure land. In the past, more than one person has obtained treasures from the bottom of the Yun River, but unfortunately, this treasure land is difficult to develop."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhou Qing immediately felt relieved. Since there were precedents of finding treasures in the Yun River, his own experience was also quite normal.</p><p></p><p>"Opportunity is opportunity, but bad luck is also truly bad luck. In such a big Black Cloud Town, you actually happened to encounter Soaring Dragon's martial artists."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing felt that his luck was... both good and bad.</p><p></p><p>"That statement is wrong. Every day, there are martial artists entering and leaving the Black Mountain in Black Cloud Town. Little junior brother, encountering martial artists is actually a very normal thing."</p><p></p><p>"However, didn't you go to repair the door? Why did you go to the Yun River?" Bai Ruoyue was suspicious.</p><p></p><p>"Because I discovered that I seem to have gained a special ability." Zhou Qing said frankly:</p><p></p><p>"I seem to be able to freely move in the water for a short period of time, so I went to try it out."</p><p></p><p>The power of the bloodline had already emerged.</p><p></p><p>Dream visualization had also appeared.</p><p></p><p>Now I have one more special ability. Is there a problem?</p><p></p><p>Of course not.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's main approach was to be open and aboveboard.</p><p></p><p>If you ask how this special ability came about?</p><p></p><p>Sorry, Zhou Qing can't explain it clearly either.</p><p></p><p>But Master Bai Tian will definitely provide a reasonable answer. Zhou Qing has great trust in his master.</p><p></p><p>He is a knowledgeable and thoughtful man.</p><p></p><p>Everyone else was shocked. There's even such a special ability? How did it come about?</p><p></p><p>After applying the medicine, Bai Ruoyue helped Zhou Qing to a chair.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's injuries were truly not light.</p><p></p><p>Unless he obtained some spirit plant treasure, he would probably need to recuperate for a while.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, you obtained an inner armor, otherwise who knows how badly you would have been beaten." Bai Ruoyue was very frightened in hindsight.</p><p></p><p>Their little junior brother was one of the martial hall's future hopes and couldn't have any mishaps.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, Second Junior Brother, let's go to the Soaring Dragon Martial Hall and demand an explanation!" Bai Ruoyue couldn't swallow this anger.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, we must seek justice for our little junior brother!"</p><p></p><p>The others also agreed with Bai Ruoyue's words. They were quite united.</p><p></p><p>However, what Bai Ruoyue didn't know was that while they were preparing to go to the Soaring Dragon Martial Hall to demand an explanation, the people from the Soaring Dragon Martial Hall had already almost reached the Supreme White Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>They...</p><p></p><p>were also coming to demand an explanation.</p><p></p><p>The people from the Supreme White Martial Hall actually beat our people to this state. This is tolerable, but that is intolerable!</p>

            <p>Chapter 29: Nine Orifice Golden Elixir!</p><p></p><p>Luo Qingmo's words enlightened Zhou Qing greatly, preventing him from encountering misfortune in his future cultivation due to ignorance.</p><p></p><p>Having someone to guide you and not having anyone to guide you are indeed two different experiences.</p><p></p><p>"You have two meritorious deeds, although those two matters have not been fully dealt with, I can reward you in advance," Luo Qingmo said.</p><p></p><p>"Auntie Mo, it's been so many days, has the matter of Huang Shiren manipulating ghosts to harm my junior brother not been handled yet?" Bai Ruoyue was a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't he just a scum who practiced Taoism to do evil?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Qingmo shook her head, "In recent years, the situation of these cultivators coming from other places is a bit complicated, it's not that simple to handle."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's heart stirred, could there be some hidden story behind this?</p><p></p><p>Luo Qingmo didn't say much more on this matter, but instead spoke of the reward for Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>"I can take it upon myself to reward you with a scroll of high-grade visualization charts and three Taoist arts."</p><p></p><p>"If you want resources for martial artists, then you'll have to look at the size of your merits and apply for rewards normally."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing understood the meaning behind Luo Qingmo's words.</p><p></p><p>If he chose resources related to Taoist arts, she would give him extra rewards, and these rewards might be something she took out herself, not from the Da Qi government.</p><p></p><p>A scroll of high-grade visualization charts and three Taoist arts were not something his merits were sufficient to obtain.</p><p></p><p>"With substandard visualization charts, breaking through is certain death, only with low-grade visualization charts is there a possibility to continue cultivating."</p><p></p><p>"As for high-grade visualization charts, they are absolutely top-notch soul cultivation methods in the entire Tianyue County, this is the foundation of soul cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Luo Qingmo once again emphasized the importance of visualization charts.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing fell into deep thought, he was not hesitating between Taoist art resources and martial artist resources, but had other ideas.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Zhou Qing tentatively asked, "Senior Luo, can my reward be exchanged for studying by your side for a period of time?"</p><p></p><p>"I can forgo the visualization charts and Taoist arts."</p><p></p><p>Does Zhou Qing lack Taoist arts?</p><p></p><p>Indeed he does.</p><p></p><p>But he lacks a sage's guidance even more, otherwise, even if Taoist arts were placed in front of Zhou Qing, he wouldn't understand them.</p><p></p><p>In that case, even if he obtained three Taoist arts, what use would they be?</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to teach me any Taoist arts, just teaching me some knowledge about soul cultivation would suffice," Zhou Qing added.</p><p></p><p>Luo Qingmo looked at Zhou Qing and said seriously, "You need to understand one thing, if you give up this opportunity, then even if Bai Tian personally speaks up for you in the future, I will not give you a high-grade visualization chart again."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing had no hesitation, "I am willing to exchange it for an opportunity to study by Senior Luo's side!"</p><p></p><p>He doesn't need some high-grade visualization chart.</p><p></p><p>He only wants knowledge!</p><p></p><p>"Little junior brother's talent is so good, just teach him a bit."</p><p></p><p>"It's not easy for me to have such a talented junior brother, in the future the two of us are going to develop the martial arts hall to the county city, and even bigger places!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Qingmo glanced at Bai Ruoyue, and said helplessly, "Even your father only asked me for a visualization chart."</p><p></p><p>Having a high-grade visualization chart doesn't guarantee becoming a powerhouse, but she is already a powerhouse now.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing silently stood to the side, waiting for his senior sister to make an effort.</p><p></p><p>Whether this matter could succeed still depended on how hard his senior sister tried.</p><p></p><p>"But little junior brother's talent is really very good..." Bai Ruoyue tried her best to pester Luo Qingmo.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Luo Qingmo couldn't handle Bai Ruoyue's pestering and agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Starting from tomorrow, come to me at this time every day, I will teach you for half an hour."</p><p></p><p>But after agreeing, she brought up another matter.</p><p></p><p>"In the territory of Heiyun Town, ghostly incidents often occur, the government has a specialized agency to deal with it, but there aren't many personnel inside."</p><p></p><p>"Are you willing to be nominally associated with the Bureau for the Control of Ghosts and Gods?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhou Qing glanced at Bai Ruoyue, "I am a person of Taibai Martial Arts Hall..."</p><p></p><p>"It's not asking you to formally join the Bureau for the Control of Ghosts and Gods, just a nominal association. Occasionally there will be compensated requests for you to assist in handling some ghostly matters, you basically won't be subject to any</p><p></p><p>"There are no restrictions or obligations. If you don't want to assist with those matters, you can refuse. No one will force you."</p><p></p><p>"There is a monthly stipend, including Dao resources."</p><p></p><p>"I am willing to serve the Great Qi!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Peach Grove, Bai Ruoyue held her head high and chest out, looking proud and arrogant. </p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, your senior sister has done you a big favor this time. Shouldn't you express your gratitude properly?"</p><p></p><p>"It goes without saying, senior sister."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing said with a smile, "From now on, whatever you want me to do, I'll do it."</p><p></p><p>Eighteen is pretty good too.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was a bit curious, "Senior sister, what is the status of this Senior Lu?"</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Mo is a cultivator dispatched by the Xuandu Observatory to Heiyun Town. She oversees all cultivator affairs within Heiyun Town's territory." Bai Ruoyue said,</p><p></p><p>So she's one of the three big shots of Heiyun Town, and can be said to be one of the highest ranking people in this area.</p><p></p><p>The organization I'm registered with is probably under her responsibility.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of force is the Xuandu Observatory? It sounds like it specializes in cultivating cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>"It's the state religion of Great Qi, the most powerful sect within Great Qi's borders." Bai Ruoyue gave Zhou Qing a look.</p><p></p><p>"Within the territory of Great Qi, every city and county has Xuandu Observatory cultivators stationed there."</p><p></p><p>"If the Taibai Martial Hall could be developed to the status of the Xuandu Observatory, then my life would be complete."</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue had some aspirations.</p><p></p><p>I think you're dreaming.</p><p></p><p>"It was the right choice for you to register with the Ghost and God Management Department. It's a secret organization that ordinary people don't know about at all and has great power. It's under Aunt Mo's responsibility."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the Ghost and God Management Department doesn't have many restrictions on people who register like you. If you're willing, you help; if you're not willing, you don't. It's just that refusing too many times will affect the monthly stipend."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing had no aversion to registering with the Ghost and God Management Department. Living within the Great Qi, it was inevitable to have some contact with the government.</p><p></p><p>Having such an identity would be more convenient in the future, and it's not really joining the government, so there are no restrictions.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue said, "Don't worry, Aunt Mo is a very good person. I often went to her place to play when I was a child. Sometimes when my father didn't have time, he would send me to Aunt Mo's place and she would take care of me."</p><p></p><p>So senior sister was a child she watched grow up.</p><p></p><p>But what is the relationship between my master and Lu Qingmo that he could entrust his child to her?</p><p></p><p>Master Bai is really an enigmatic man.</p><p></p><p>"In the future, when you go to Aunt Mo's place to study, you need to be careful with your words." Bai Ruoyue warned Zhou Qing, "If you provoke people like you used to, and get kicked out by Aunt Mo, I won't be responsible."</p><p></p><p>"I speak very nicely, don't worry."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, is the visualization scroll you're cultivating any good?" Bai Ruoyue thought of this matter, "If not, we need to find a way to get a good one. I can have my dad accompany you to the prefecture city to take a look."</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue didn't mention going to ask Lu Qingmo for one. She knew her place.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm doing great. I'll show you when I have a chance in the future."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>You must be joking. How could the Great Thousand Immortal Tree possibly not be good?</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Great Thousand Immortal Tree in front of him, after learning the importance of visualization scrolls, Zhou Qing was even more confident about the future of his soul.</p><p></p><p>It was time for the daily tree chopping again. As usual, Zhou Qing took a look at his status panel, but this time, he discovered something incredible.</p><p></p><p>Most of the information was unchanged, but one line was different.</p><p></p><p>[...]</p><p></p><p>[Stamina: 2/2 (Seventh day logging into the Immortal Tree Secret Realm, reward bonus obtained)]</p><p></p><p>[...]</p><p></p><p>Another reward bonus!</p><p></p><p>Without a second word, Zhou Qing raised his axe and chopped down.</p><p></p><p>[Low-grade Elixir: Nine Aperture Golden Elixir]</p><p></p><p>[A special elixir, not part of the sequence. The elixir has nine apertures, as if alive. After use, it can greatly enhance the potential of the physical body, washing the tendons and marrow. The medicinal power constantly infuses into the flesh, allowing martial arts to advance by leaps and bounds]</p><p></p><p>[Usage: Open a hole in the heart, place the Nine Aperture Golden Elixir inside, it will automatically merge into the heart, and the medicinal power will spread throughout the body with the flow of blood]</p><p></p><p>Gold has appeared!</p>

            <p>Chapter 20: Mighty and Domineering</p><p></p><p>The clamor came from the entrance of the martial arts hall, and Bai Ruoyue frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister Shen, go out and see what happened."</p><p></p><p>Shen Yu, the sixth disciple, ran out in a hurry and then ran back in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>"It's not good, Senior Sister. People from the Tenglong Martial Arts Hall are here and asking us for an explanation!"</p><p></p><p>"Smack!"</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue slapped the table, and the table was directly smashed.</p><p></p><p>"Tenglong Martial Arts Hall, they are too much. They robbed the spiritual plant, injured our junior brother, and I haven't even gone to find them yet, but they dare to come and ask for an explanation?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go out and beat them up!"</p><p></p><p>How could Bai Ruoyue endure this grievance?</p><p></p><p>She practiced secret martial arts!</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment, Senior Sister." Zhang Yuantao called out to Bai Ruoyue and said,</p><p></p><p>"Bring the clothes that junior brother was wearing just now and put them on him, then find a stretcher and carry junior brother out."</p><p></p><p>"What is this for?" Bai Ruoyue asked.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yuantao sneered, "Junior brother was almost beaten to death by them, they must compensate!"</p><p></p><p>"And also let everyone see how seriously junior brother was injured by them. When Master returns, let Master go to the Tenglong Martial Arts Hall for a visit!"</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother was almost beaten to death?" Bai Ruoyue was puzzled at first, then suddenly realized and clapped her hands.</p><p></p><p>"Right! Junior brother is almost dead!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>I feel it's really unnecessary.</p><p></p><p>This third senior brother is very scheming, no wonder he usually manages the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>But I like it.</p><p></p><p>So Zhou Qing once again became the bloodstained appearance from before, and was even put on a stretcher, looking like he was on the verge of death.</p><p></p><p>With his spirit and qi and blood working together, Zhou Qing was able to disguise himself very well as a seriously injured person.</p><p></p><p>When they reached the entrance, a group of people from the Tenglong Martial Arts Hall were aggressively imposing. Bai Ruoyue took a closer look and saw that they were all disciples of the hall master.</p><p></p><p>"Surnamed Long, how dare you come!" Zhang Yuantao took the initiative and pointed at Zhou Qing on the stretcher, angrily saying,</p><p></p><p>"In order to rob my junior brother's spiritual plant, you beat my junior brother into this state, and you still have the face to come and make trouble?"</p><p></p><p>Long Yun, the eldest disciple of Tenglong, glanced at Zhou Qing and frowned.</p><p></p><p>How come this person looks like he's almost done for, it's different from what Junior Brother Yang said.</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Yuantao, don't try to confuse right and wrong here!" Long Yun pulled over Yang Xing, whose hand was broken, and also pointed at the Wang brothers.</p><p></p><p>"Instead, it's your junior brother who disregarded the rules of martial artists and the relationship between the two martial arts halls, and ruthlessly attacked."</p><p></p><p>"A trainee from my Tenglong Martial Arts Hall was almost beaten to death by him. Although he was rescued, he has become a cripple."</p><p></p><p>"My junior brother Yang Xing's hand was directly broken, obstructing his martial arts path."</p><p></p><p>"For such an evil disciple, the Taibai Martial Arts Hall must give an explanation today!"</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue was slightly shocked in her heart. Yang Xing and Wang Er seemed to be seriously injured. Is my junior brother really that powerful?</p><p></p><p>Could it be a self-harming scheme?</p><p></p><p>She sneered a couple of times, "The spiritual plant that my junior brother obtained from the bottom of the Yunjiang River, how did it become an ownerless object in your mouth?"</p><p></p><p>"Open your dog eyes and take a good look, my junior brother's clothes are not even dry yet!"</p><p></p><p>"And you, Yang Xing, you have studied at the Taibai Martial Arts Hall for a period of time after all. How dare you do such a thing now, you really have no sense of shame!"</p><p></p><p>Yang Xing's face turned red with anger, but he couldn't refute.</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense!" Long Yun retorted,</p><p></p><p>"That spiritual plant was clearly discovered by my junior brother Yang Xing first, and his wet clothes are still in the Tenglong Martial Arts Hall!"</p><p></p><p>"What can a piece of clothing prove?"</p><p></p><p>Long Yun had already thought of what to say, it's just a wet piece of clothing.</p><p></p><p>As long as he wanted, he could wet dozens of them at any time.</p><p></p><p>"The people from the Tenglong Martial Arts Hall are really shameless. Three people ganged up on my junior brother alone, beating my junior brother into a coma, and they still dare to come here and cause trouble!"</p><p></p><p>"If you don't give an explanation today, don't even think about leaving!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yuantao shouted loudly, and several senior and junior brothers vaguely surrounded the people from the Tenglong Martial Arts Hall. As one of the three major martial arts halls, they were naturally not afraid.</p><p></p><p>Long Yun was furious and really wanted to beat Zhang Yuantao up, but he was also wary that this was Taibai's home ground.</p><p></p><p>At first, when he saw that the people from his own martial arts hall were beaten into this state, and Yang Xing also said that the violent person was not seriously injured, Long Yun immediately became angry. He felt that he couldn't suffer this loss, so he rushed over in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>Of course, most importantly, Yang Xing also revealed the iron staff that Zhou Qing used.</p><p></p><p>Long Yun immediately judged that it was a martial weapon, and he became envious, wanting to take advantage of the situation.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yi.</p><p></p><p>But upon closer look, something wasn't right.</p><p></p><p>If we're being logical, even though he twisted the facts, he seemed to have a leg to stand on, but this wouldn't hold up under scrutiny. As long as one went to the scene, the flaws would be easily exposed.  </p><p></p><p>Although Long Yun also suspected that Zhou Qing was faking it, Zhou Qing was protected behind him, so he couldn't be sure.</p><p></p><p>"So our Tenglong people were beaten for nothing?" Long Yun didn't want to back down, it was a martial weapon after all!</p><p></p><p>"Robbing and killing on the road, they deserved to die!" Bai Ruoyue glared at Long Yun.</p><p></p><p>Long Yun was very irritated and wanted to slap Yang Xing.</p><p></p><p>Useless, if you had taken out that person by the river, how could there be so many problems now!</p><p></p><p>Lying on the stretcher, Zhou Qing felt a little comfortable, speculating how things would develop next.</p><p></p><p>Hmm... according to the plot of the novel, that Long Yun would probably propose a gambling duel in a few days, with one match each in the Flesh Realm, Tendon Realm, and Viscera Realm, best two out of three to decide how to end this matter.</p><p></p><p>Then he, the person involved, would recover from his injuries before the gambling duel began and make a timely appearance to participate in the Flesh Realm duel. </p><p></p><p>And at that time, the situation would be one win and one loss for Taibai, and his match would be the most critical one.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Zhou Qing would turn the tide and defeat the enemy, winning this victory for Taibai Martial Hall and gaining glory!</p><p></p><p>This was simply too great!</p><p></p><p>"Bai Ruoyue, what do you want?" </p><p></p><p>"Nothing much, come and fight me!"  Bai Ruoyue was eager to give it a try.</p><p></p><p>"Don't go too far!"</p><p></p><p>"Your junior brother hit my junior brother, so as the senior sister, what's wrong with me hitting you, the senior brother?"</p><p></p><p>"I want to vent this anger for my junior brother!"</p><p></p><p>"Disciples of Taibai, how can we be humiliated!"</p><p></p><p>With that said, Bai Ruoyue directly leapt forward, forcing Long Yun to fight her.</p><p></p><p>As the senior brother of Tenglong, Long Yun naturally couldn't back down at this point.</p><p></p><p>The clash between Viscera Realm warriors was extremely imposing. Even though both sides exercised some restraint, it still forced the crowd to retreat, not daring to approach.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>In the end, Bai Ruoyue kicked Long Yun in the stomach, sending him flying, leaving him covered in dust and extremely wretched.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue didn't press further. She clapped her hands and said condescendingly:</p><p></p><p>"The anger is vented, but the compensation can't be less. Three hundred-refined weapons, three spirit plants!"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you just rob some?"</p><p></p><p>Long Yun covered his abdomen, his chest heaving violently. Furious, he finally dropped a sentence.</p><p></p><p>"Tell your dad to talk to my dad!"</p><p></p><p>Long Yun stood up, gave Yang Xing a vicious look, then left dejectedly. </p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing enjoyed watching the show and gave Bai Ruoyue a frenzied thumbs up. The senior sister was both big and cool, mighty and domineering.</p><p></p><p>But Zhou Qing was also a little dumbfounded. No, how could you just leave?</p><p></p><p>What about the gambling duel? What about me turning the tide?</p><p></p><p>I haven't had a chance to show off yet!</p><p></p><p>You coward, you got beaten up and then ran away like this, come back!</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue and the others carried Zhou Qing back to the backyard, and the events that happened today would also be spread by the onlookers.</p><p></p><p>As word spread, Taibai Martial Hall's reputation would grow even greater.</p><p></p><p>Back in the backyard, Zhou Qing, who was about to die, directly got up.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, the people from Tenglong Martial Hall just left like that?" Zhou Qing found it a little hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, what else could they do if they don't leave?" Bai Ruoyue smiled. After beating up Long Yun, her anger had finally dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"But Long Yun was beaten by you in public and lost all face..."</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue threw clean clothes to Zhou Qing and said seriously:</p><p></p><p>"Our Taibai Martial Hall is one of the three major martial halls in Heiyun Town. My dad is one of the strongest people in Heiyun Town, and I am the strongest among the younger generation in Heiyun Town."</p><p></p><p>"If we can't handle such a matter and can't stand up for you, Taibai Martial Hall might as well disband early."</p><p></p><p>"Little Junior Brother, remember, Taibai Martial Hall is your eternal backing. Standing behind you is one of the strongest forces in the entire Heiyun Town. No one can pressure you with their power!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing fell silent, finally gaining a correct understanding of his identity as a disciple of Taibai.</p><p></p><p>Don't let Tenglong become more and more arrogant, Taibai is the most awesome.</p><p></p><p>I looked at the comment section, and there are many suggestions for cheats.

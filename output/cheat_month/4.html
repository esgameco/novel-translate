            <p>Chapter 4: Flesh and Skin Training Methods</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Bai, does Taibai Martial Arts School consider the family background of the disciples they recruit?" </p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue answered expressionlessly:</p><p></p><p>"The best age for martial arts training is between twelve and eighteen. You're already twenty-two, it will be difficult for you to achieve much."</p><p></p><p>"Fifteen taels of silver is not a small sum. You shouldn't spend the money on something that is destined to have no return."</p><p></p><p>"Take the registration fee back. Life is more important than martial arts training."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was stunned for a moment, then his brows relaxed and he felt a little amused.</p><p></p><p>This was different from what he had imagined. He thought he would encounter a situation where he was looked down upon because of his background, and he was prepared to slap them in the face.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't expect that he would... encounter a good person.</p><p></p><p>He had come to pay money and contribute to Taibai Martial Arts School's income, but this Teacher Bai was actually considering his situation and wanted to return the money to him.</p><p></p><p>You're quite a good person.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Bai, if I take the tuition fee and leave, the school will lose a sum of money." Zhou Qing looked at the kind-hearted Bai and said with a smile:</p><p></p><p>"If the head of the school finds out about this, he will probably punish you."</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Bai is kind-hearted, and I can't let you get into trouble. I won't leave!"</p><p></p><p>You have to accept this tuition fee whether you want it or not!</p><p></p><p>Of course, if you're willing to waive the tuition fee and still let me join the school, that would naturally be even better.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue still maintained her expressionless state. She glanced at Zhou Qing and said:</p><p></p><p>"The head of the school is my father."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Sorry for the disturbance.</p><p></p><p>I'll leave now.</p><p></p><p>No, wait. Since the head of the school is her father, I have even more reason not to leave!</p><p></p><p>Don't misunderstand, Zhou Qing didn't want to take a shortcut in life. Zhou Qing simply admired Bai Ruoyue's character.</p><p></p><p>With a daughter of such character, the head of the school himself couldn't be too bad, right?</p><p></p><p>"Are you leaving or not?" Bai Ruoyue said.</p><p></p><p>Why won't this person listen to advice?</p><p></p><p>Is martial arts training that easy?</p><p></p><p>What can you achieve by starting at the age of twenty-two? </p><p></p><p>You know it's not possible.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Zhou Qing still let down Bai Ruoyue's good intentions. He took the certificate and went through the door behind Bai Ruoyue. Bai Ruoyue didn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>Li Wu and another young girl were standing by a window in the corner at this time. Seeing this, Zhou Qing also walked over.</p><p></p><p>"New disciple?" There was a man at the window.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Zhou Qing handed over the certificate. The man took a look, took a wooden plaque, engraved Zhou Qing's name and some information on it, and handed it to Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>"In the future, you can come here directly with this token, without going through Teacher Bai."</p><p></p><p>"My name is He Feng, a disciple of the head of the school, and one of your teachers for these four months."</p><p></p><p>The three of them, including Zhou Qing, called him Teacher He.</p><p></p><p>"Let me explain the rules of our martial arts school to you." He Feng came out and said:</p><p></p><p>"Right now, you are only considered ordinary disciples of the martial arts school. If you can enter the Flesh and Skin Realm within four months, then you can be promoted to advanced disciples of the martial arts school."</p><p></p><p>"Advanced disciples can continue to stay and learn at the martial arts school without paying tuition fees, but there are certain obligations that need to be fulfilled. Of course, you can also choose to continue paying tuition fees to learn, but that will be very expensive."</p><p></p><p>If you're unwilling to fulfill the obligations, the martial arts school naturally won't be kind enough to waive the fees.</p><p></p><p>"In addition, as long as your talent is good enough, after becoming an advanced disciple, you will have the opportunity to be accepted as a personal disciple of the head of the school."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing listened quietly to He Feng's words.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary disciples, advanced disciples, personal disciples of the head of the school.</p><p></p><p>This was the internal hierarchy of status at Taibai Martial Arts School.</p><p></p><p>"Taibai Martial Arts School practices the Taibai Fist technique. In the Flesh and Skin stage, there are three training methods for the Taibai Fist technique: Elephant Form, Ox Form, and Crane Form. There is no distinction between high and low, and you can choose any one of the training methods."</p><p></p><p>This Elephant Form and Ox Form don't sound imposing enough. If I were the one naming them, I would directly call them Divine Elephant Prison-Suppressing Power, Great Strength Ox Demon Fist, and Pine Crane Longevity Fist, Zhou Qing thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>With such imposing martial arts names, the number of people coming to learn martial arts would be endless.</p><p></p><p>And when competing with others, you would naturally have an advantage from the start.</p><p></p><p>"I will assess your physique to see which training method is more suitable for you."</p><p></p><p>"Choosing a training method that suits you will make your future cultivation twice as effective with half the effort."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Bai Ruoyue also came in and called over the only young girl among the three of them, including Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>Assessing physique, the name alone makes it clear what needs to be done. It's not appropriate for He Feng, a man, to touch a girl's body.</p><p></p><p>First was Li Wu. Zhou Qing watched from the side as He Feng's hands moved up and down Li Wu's body, his heart remaining calm.</p><p></p><p>He had seen even more explosive things back on Earth.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, you're suitable for the Ox Form." He Feng said.</p><p></p><p>Li Wu nodded, then asked with some anticipation: "Teacher He, how is my talent?"</p><p></p><p>"Since you have already entered the martial arts school, regardless of your talent, you have to stay for four months." He Feng shook his head and said:</p><p></p><p>"Within these four months, focus wholeheartedly on martial arts training and don't worry about anything else. Don't tell me you're going to become complacent and slack off if your talent is good, or become discouraged and give up if your talent is poor?"</p><p></p><p>"My master said that in the way of martial arts, the importance of perseverance is no less than talent."</p><p></p><p>"As long as you practice diligently without interruption, you will definitely be able to achieve something."</p><p></p><p>Not getting an answer, Li Wu was a little disappointed. Young people always fantasize about being the most unique one in the world.</p><p></p><p>But Zhou Qing took a few more glances at He Feng.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Taibai Martial Arts School had the best reputation. It seemed that it wasn't just because of the low fees.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing hadn't seen the other disciples of the head of the school, so he couldn't comment on them for now, but the kind-hearted Bai and He Feng indeed had a strong sense of responsibility.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing knew that he had come to the right place.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Bai Ruoyue also led the young girl over and said briefly:</p><p></p><p>"Crane Form."</p><p></p><p>"As expected." He Feng smiled.</p><p></p><p>Most female disciples were suitable for practicing the Crane Form, with only a few exceptions.</p><p></p><p>Next, it was Zhou Qing's turn to be assessed. At first, He Feng was very relaxed, but the more he assessed, the more abnormal his expression became.</p><p></p><p>What a well-built man!</p><p></p><p>After finishing the assessment, He Feng looked at Zhou Qing with amazement in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher He, which training method am I suitable for?"</p><p></p><p>"Your body... is very rare. You are extremely suitable for all three training methods."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Wu looked at Zhou Qing with envy.</p><p></p><p>I'm only suitable for one, but he's suitable for all three. It sounds so impressive.</p><p></p><p>"Your situation is a bit special. We need to discuss it before making a decision. Please wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, He Feng gave Bai Ruoyue a look, and the two of them went into another room.</p><p></p><p>Although Bai Ruoyue was younger than He Feng, she had entered the school earlier.</p><p></p><p>She had been with the head of the school since the day she was born, a true veteran.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, there's something strange about that Zhou Qing's body." He Feng said:</p><p></p><p>"I found that his body is already no weaker than some martial artists who have just entered the Flesh and Skin Realm, and it is very lively."</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue was stunned for a moment. Her first reaction was that Zhou Qing had falsely reported his age.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Isn't he twenty-two years old?" </p><p></p><p>But then he also felt that something was off.</p><p></p><p>"His bone age is indeed twenty-two years old, he didn't lie, but his body is very special, full of vitality and vigorous energy, far surpassing ordinary people." He Feng said:</p><p></p><p>"This is the first time I've encountered this kind of situation, I'm not sure what to do. Do you think we should inform Master?"</p><p></p><p>"Father seems to be meeting some distinguished guest... Nevermind."</p><p></p><p>"You go teach them martial arts first, I'll go talk to Father." Bai Ruoyue left in a hurry. </p><p></p><p>What does it mean to have a physique comparable to a martial artist who has just entered the Flesh Realm without any martial arts training?</p><p></p><p>It means that as soon as Zhou Qing steps into the threshold of martial arts, his foundational physique will be stronger than those at the same level, and his actual strength will far surpass his peers.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it also signifies an extremely outstanding innate talent in physical body, with a greater possibility of becoming a master!</p><p></p><p>Twenty-two years old, too old to learn martial arts?</p><p></p><p>Not old, not old at all.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, he's still very young and has plenty of time to practice in the future!</p><p></p><p>On her way to find her father, Bai Ruoyue suddenly felt a sense of relief.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, that Zhou Qing is a stubborn person and wasn't dissuaded by her. She almost did a "bad thing" with good intentions.</p><p></p><p>The three of them, Zhou Qing and the others, were left at the original spot. The atmosphere was a bit awkward among the three strangers.</p><p></p><p>Well, Zhou Qing wasn't awkward.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou Qing took the initiative to strike up a conversation. He later learned that the girl was called Wang Taotao, fifteen years old this year, the same age as Li Wu.</p><p></p><p>That kid Li Wu was unwilling to talk to this old fellow Zhou Qing, but when facing Wang Taotao, he wanted to say something but didn't know what to say, stammering.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing watched from the side, really wanting to laugh.</p><p></p><p>Letting the two peers communicate there, Zhou Qing thought of the two hall master disciples who had left.</p><p></p><p>"They should have discovered the peculiarities of my body." Zhou Qing secretly thought.</p><p></p><p>After taking the Origin of Life, his body had indeed undergone tremendous changes. He felt as strong as an ox.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts of this world mainly focused on physical body. Zhou Qing's physique was undoubtedly very suitable for practicing martial arts.</p><p></p><p>After He Feng returned, he brought the three to a corner of the training hall.</p><p></p><p>"Wang Taotao, later the senior sister will come to teach you the Crane Form. For now, just observe."</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing, which martial art do you practice? Wait for the senior sister to come back before making a decision."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing nodded, having no objection.</p><p></p><p>In this way, He Feng could only teach Li Wu the Bull Form first.</p><p></p><p>So Li Wu looked at He Feng with special anticipation, but this hall master disciple first started talking about other things.</p><p></p><p>"On the path of martial arts, it begins with nourishing life. The process of practicing martial arts is also the process of nourishing life. If supplemented with medicinal soups during the process, it will have even better effects."</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts hall sells nourishing medicinal soups. If you need them, you can go buy them. The effects are quite good."</p><p></p><p>"After nourishing life is complete, you'll need to start impacting the threshold of martial arts and strive to formally enter the realm."</p><p></p><p>The fifteen taels of silver was just the tuition fee and did not include the cost of medicinal soups.</p><p></p><p>As long as one decides to practice martial arts, a lot of silver is needed to support it. The saying "poor scholars, rich warriors" is not just empty talk.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing wasn't concerned about those medicinal soups. Anyway, he didn't have the money to afford them.</p><p></p><p>But this also made Zhou Qing increasingly miss the Heaven and Earth Money House.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing asked a question.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher He, is nourishing life also a martial arts realm?"</p><p></p><p>He Feng shook his head, "It's not considered a formal martial arts realm, only a preparatory stage to condition the body into a healthy state more suitable for practicing martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"During the process of nourishing life, some hidden injuries and imbalances in the body will be healed. Everyone who completes nourishing life, unless they have congenital defects, will be incomparably healthy."</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry. Even without medicinal soups, as long as you diligently practice martial arts, you can also complete nourishing life. It won't take too long."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing understood. This nourishing life was just a prerequisite for formally practicing martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"After completing nourishing life, you need to persist in cultivating martial arts techniques and training the flesh. When you refine the first wisp of inner qi, that is entering the early Flesh Realm, equivalent to a high-level disciple of the martial arts hall."</p><p></p><p>"When the skin and membrane shine, and the flesh and blood are filled with primal qi, you will enter the peak of the Flesh Realm. At this step, you can greatly resist damage from mundane weapons. Swords can't cut, spears can't pierce, defeating a hundred people is a piece of cake."</p><p></p><p>"What you need to do now is learn martial arts and complete nourishing life as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Li Wu and Wang Taotao were stirred in their hearts by his words. Resisting weapons, defeating a hundred people!</p><p></p><p>It was really too cool!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was also a bit excited in his heart. Extraordinary power was within reach. This was something he absolutely couldn't touch in his previous life. He yearned for it immensely.</p><p></p><p>Next, He Feng directly began demonstrating the Bull Form to Li Wu.</p><p></p><p>Using both fists and feet, amidst the turning and shifting, explosive sounds rang out, the momentum not small.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing and the other two kept retreating, feeling an immense pressure, as if a large predator was pouncing at them.</p><p></p><p>Li Wu and Wang Taotao's faces turned pale, while Zhou Qing's performance was a bit better than the two.</p><p></p><p>Other people in this training area also gathered around, watching He Feng demonstrate the martial art.</p><p></p><p>They had all received martial arts suitable for them, but none had entered the Flesh Realm yet. Being able to observe He Feng, a master of this level, demonstrate for teaching purposes would also be helpful to them.</p><p></p><p>After finishing a set of martial arts, He Feng's breathing was still steady, not the slightest bit rushed. He looked at Li Wu and asked:</p><p></p><p>"Did you remember it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Wu had just come back to his senses. Hearing the words, his face instantly flushed red, a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"Only re-, remembered a little."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, not bad. You try it, I'll break down each move and guide you. No need to rush."</p><p></p><p>He Feng wasn't surprised by Li Wu's answer.</p><p></p><p>He had never seen a genius who could remember the entire martial art after watching him demonstrate it once. Every disciple learned it slowly, move by move, with his detailed explanations later.</p><p></p><p>"I practice the Bull Form too. I've been practicing for two months, but still feel this set of martial arts is profound and haven't thoroughly understood it. It also took me a very long time to completely remember and learn it back then."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, how difficult it is to learn a cultivation technique."</p><p></p><p>"Even in the other two major martial arts halls, there has never been any talk of someone being able to learn such a martial art in one go."</p><p></p><p>The surrounding people also sighed with emotion and didn't ridicule Li Wu at this time. They had all gone through this before.</p><p></p><p>If they ridiculed Li Wu now, it would make them seem brainless.</p><p></p><p>If they wanted to ridicule, they should wait until the time Li Wu takes to learn this martial art is longer than theirs.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing took in the surrounding voices, looking left and right. He found that everyone had an approving expression and was also earnestly watching He Feng break down the Bull Form.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Is this Bull Form really that difficult to learn?</p><p></p><p>I seem to have remembered it all after just watching it once, right?</p><p></p><p>Hey, I'll be damned, could it be that I'm also a genius in terms of comprehension?</p><p></p><p>Seeking follows, favorites, recommendations, monthly tickets, rewards...</p><p></p><p>It's a new book, so asking for a bit more stuff.</p>

            <p>Chapter 22: Mountain Temple</p><p></p><p>In the evening, Senior Sister Shen Yu sent the injured Zhou Qing back home, gave him a few reminders, and declined his invitation to come in and sit for a while.</p><p></p><p>After returning home and confirming that no one was following him, Zhou Qing immediately entered the Immortal Tree Secret Realm and began to visualize the Great Thousand Immortal Tree.</p><p></p><p>Practicing martial arts during the day and cultivating the Dao at night, Zhou Qing's life was very regular, and he never slacked off.</p><p></p><p>Although he had many opportunities, Zhou Qing also understood the importance of his own efforts.</p><p></p><p>After traversing through time and embarking on the path of transcendence, Zhou Qing cherished all of this.</p><p></p><p>The Great Thousand Immortal Tree in Zhou Qing's mind was slowly improving. In the state of visualization, time passed quickly, and Zhou Qing's physical strength was refreshed again.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, he picked up the axe and chopped fiercely.</p><p></p><p>This was the fifth day Zhou Qing had been chopping the tree, and one-sixth of the month had already passed.</p><p></p><p>A glowing orb fell down.</p><p></p><p>[Low-grade Spiritual Plant: Crimson Fruit]</p><p></p><p>[One of the best among low-grade heavenly spiritual plants, containing vast energy that can enhance physical vitality and internal breath]</p><p></p><p>Seeing the information about this drop, Zhou Qing was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>After chopping the tree for five days, he finally saw a classic treasure like the Crimson Fruit, and its effects also made Zhou Qing very satisfied. It was better than the spiritual plants that had dropped before.</p><p></p><p>Although this Great Thousand Immortal Tree was said to drop everything, the items with the highest probability of dropping were actually still related to martial arts and souls.</p><p></p><p>After all, the items it dropped were related to the strength, realm, and essence of life of the person chopping the tree.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing practiced martial arts and cultivated his soul, so it naturally followed Zhou Qing's actual situation.</p><p></p><p>Things unrelated to martial arts and Dao methods could also possibly drop, but the probability was relatively small.</p><p></p><p>After a good start, Zhou Qing was even more looking forward to the next drop, and the axe fell on the tree trunk.</p><p></p><p>[Talisman: Vajra Talisman]</p><p></p><p>[A Dao talisman containing the Vajra Dharma Mantra. When activated, it can grant the blessing of Vajra power. Can be used three times]</p><p></p><p>[Talisman: Qi Observation Talisman] </p><p></p><p>[A Dao talisman containing the Qi Observation Dharma Mantra. When activated, it can observe various types of Qi and understand their meanings. Can be used three times]</p><p></p><p>This time, things that had never appeared before dropped again - talismans!</p><p></p><p>Two talismans, one gold and one white.</p><p></p><p>The Vajra Talisman was a combat talisman that would definitely be useful in the future, while the Qi Observation Talisman was an auxiliary talisman.</p><p></p><p>As long as Zhou Qing injected spiritual power, the talismans would be activated. Suppressing the eagerness in his heart, Zhou Qing did not use them.</p><p></p><p>They could only be used three times in total, so using them now would be too wasteful.</p><p></p><p>Keeping the talismans close to his body, Zhou Qing felt more at ease.</p><p></p><p>He had more and more means at his disposal!</p><p></p><p>A huge heat flow surged in Zhou Qing's body. He immediately began to cultivate the secret martial art to refine the energy.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, under the medicinal effect of the Crimson Fruit, the injuries on Zhou Qing's body also began to heal at an accelerated rate.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing still had a Water Spiritual Plant, but he had already consumed it during the day at the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>As for the inner armor and the gun barrel, Bai Ruoyue and the others naturally wouldn't have any thoughts about them.</p><p></p><p>And regarding the matter of spirit weapons, Zhou Qing had also learned about it from Bai Ruoyue.</p><p></p><p>As he had previously guessed, these were indeed weapons used by martial artists, and there was more than one intact spirit weapon in Taibai Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>In the morning, after arriving at the martial arts hall, Zhou Qing first showed his senior brothers and sisters how quickly his injuries had healed, causing them to be surprised.</p><p></p><p>"A single Water Spiritual Plant has such an effect?" Zhang Yuantao doubted his life.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue, on the other hand, routinely performed a morning grope on Zhou Qing, and sure enough, it was just as she expected.</p><p></p><p>Her little junior brother's cultivation had improved greatly yet again.</p><p></p><p>She was used to it, and there was nothing she couldn't accept. He was just a freak.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, are there any Daoist sects or similar forces in Heiyun Town?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After changing into a set of ordinary clothes, Zhou Qing once again came to the outskirts of Heiyun Town, but this time he didn't go to Yunjiang, but to the town</p><p></p><p>Title: Outside the West</p><p></p><p>There is a temple here, which is Zhou Qing's destination.</p><p></p><p>This temple is not very grand, nor is it very old, but it has quite a few worshippers.</p><p></p><p>When Zhou Qing left the town and walked towards this place, he encountered many fellow travelers on the way.</p><p></p><p>Shanshui Temple.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing looked at the plaque overhead and found it to be quite ordinary, not even as special as the one at Taibai Martial Arts Hall.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing entered Shanshui Temple and found it strange that most of the people who came to burn incense and worship Buddha were in pairs of one man and one woman, and they all seemed to be married couples.</p><p></p><p>"Are they here to pray for a child?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing thought of what Bai Ruoyue had told him.</p><p></p><p>In Heiyun Town and its surrounding areas, there are no Taoist temples, and only this Shanshui Temple, which was built six years ago, is the sole Buddhist temple.</p><p></p><p>However, in Heiyun Town, Shanshui Temple is quite famous for being very efficacious.</p><p></p><p>Some couples who had been childless for years came here to pray, and surprisingly, they truly conceived not long after returning home.</p><p></p><p>Not every couple who came to pray for a child was able to conceive; perhaps only three out of ten couples had their wishes fulfilled, or even fewer.</p><p></p><p>However, for the people of this era, this was already a manifestation of the Bodhisattva's divine power.</p><p></p><p>Because of this efficacy, Zhou Qing came to Shanshui Temple.</p><p></p><p>He had no Taoist techniques to practice, and Taoist temples and Buddhist temples were the most likely to possess relevant heritage.</p><p></p><p>Shanshui Temple's remarkable efficacy might indicate that it had some tricks up its sleeve, so Zhou Qing decided to give it a try.</p><p></p><p>Following the flow of people, Zhou Qing arrived at the main hall, not the Mahavira Hall, but the Shanshui Hall.</p><p></p><p>To Zhou Qing's surprise, the main hall did not enshrine any Bodhisattva or Buddha.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it enshrined a handful of soil and a bowl of water!</p><p></p><p>After completing some necessary rituals for visiting a Buddhist temple, Zhou Qing approached a monk and asked curiously,</p><p></p><p>"Venerable master, may I ask what is enshrined here..."</p><p></p><p>"The mountains and rivers are immeasurable."</p><p></p><p>The monk chanted a phrase... let's call it a "Buddha's name" for now, and then said,</p><p></p><p>"That soil is from Black Mountain, and that water is from Cloud River."</p><p></p><p>"Our temple worships the Mountain God of Black Mountain and the Dragon Lord of Cloud River."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was greatly surprised. A Buddhist temple worshipping a Mountain God and a Dragon Lord?</p><p></p><p>What kind of bull-headed man is this?</p><p></p><p>No, if they worship the Mountain God and Dragon Lord, why build a Buddhist temple? Why not just build a Mountain God Temple or a Dragon Lord Temple directly?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the monk in front of him was dressed in standard monk attire.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing found this too strange.</p><p></p><p>Of course, although Zhou Qing did not understand, he expressed his respect.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing walked around Shanshui Temple and discovered that there were five senior monks active outside, while the rest were all young novices.</p><p></p><p>And those five senior monks all possessed martial arts skills, but Zhou Qing could not tell whether they had practiced Taoist techniques or not.</p><p></p><p>Compared to martial artists, the concealment of cultivators is very high.</p><p></p><p>After making a round, Zhou Qing directly approached a senior monk and asked if he could meet the abbot of the temple.</p><p></p><p>"If the benefactor is here to pray for a child, there is no need to see the abbot. The couple only needs to rest in our temple for a night."</p><p></p><p>The monk had an ordinary appearance, but his face indeed showed a sense of kindness.</p><p></p><p>"I have some personal matters that require the abbot's guidance..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing spoke sincerely, showing his earnestness, and the monk finally relented and led Zhou Qing to a place.</p><p></p><p>On the way, Zhou Qing touched his slightly deflated "wallet" and sighed.</p><p></p><p>As expected, this place also values money.</p><p></p><p>It is true that with money, one can go anywhere; without money, it is difficult to take a single step.</p><p></p><p>If Zhou Qing had no money, he probably would not be able to see the abbot today.</p><p></p><p>Buddha indeed does not save those without money.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to the head teacher next door, Quark2021, Xiaozizi, and Shanhe Wanli Fu for their rewards, and thanks to all the book friends for their monthly ticket support!</p>

            <p>Chapter 16: Breakthrough, Visualization Realm! (Please continue reading)</p><p></p><p>The Great Thousand Immortal Tree, with its mysterious origins, is incredibly ancient.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was certain that visualizing the Immortal Tree was countless times better than visualizing the Yaksha.</p><p></p><p>Even if he said he would try to find a way to obtain a visualization picture from the officials during the day, Zhou Qing still didn't believe it could surpass this Great Thousand Immortal Tree.</p><p></p><p>The Great Qi government was very powerful, and they might have the legendary top-level visualization pictures.</p><p></p><p>But Zhou Qing definitely couldn't obtain those kinds of visualization pictures.</p><p></p><p>So this Great Thousand Immortal Tree was Zhou Qing's best and only choice.</p><p></p><p>If the visualization picture was inferior, then one would be at a disadvantage from the start, just like the difference in martial arts practice methods.</p><p></p><p>Could this Great Thousand Immortal Tree be inferior?</p><p></p><p>Of course not.</p><p></p><p>Standing in the dark space, Zhou Qing came to the closest spot to the Great Thousand Immortal Tree and began to meditate, visualizing this Immortal Tree.</p><p></p><p>Although the visualization picture in the Yaksha Visualization Method wasn't good enough, the knowledge recorded on it was universal and easy to understand. Zhou Qing was already very clear about the cultivation of the Visualization Realm.</p><p></p><p>In a daze and in a state of chaos, Zhou Qing felt as if he had become a tree.</p><p></p><p>Tree roots... tree body... tree trunk... tree leaves...</p><p></p><p>A tree with a shape almost identical to the Great Thousand Immortal Tree appeared in Zhou Qing's Soul Realm. The moment it manifested, a strange change occurred.</p><p></p><p>The gray mist surrounding Zhou Qing's Soul Realm surged, and then strands of gray mist poured into the "Immortal Tree". When they floated out again, they had become strands of transparent liquid lines.</p><p></p><p>These transparent liquid lines fell into the "puddle" at the center of the Soul Realm, strengthening the "puddle". At the same time, the originally colorful "puddle" gradually turned transparent.</p><p></p><p>This process continued for a period of time, and Zhou Qing's Soul Realm expanded a lot, and the "puddle" also grew.</p><p></p><p>At some point, Zhou Qing woke up, and the first thing he felt was that he was different.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if he had entered another level of the world, leaving the mundane world behind.</p><p></p><p>[...]</p><p></p><p>[Soul Realm: Visualization Realm]</p><p></p><p>[Physical Realm: Flesh Realm (Initial)]</p><p></p><p>[Stamina: 2/2]</p><p></p><p>[...]</p><p></p><p>Opening the panel, two pieces of data had changed.</p><p></p><p>His soul cultivation had officially entered the Visualization Realm, and his stamina had recovered!</p><p></p><p>"Did I visualize for that long?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was a bit surprised. When he returned home, the sun had just set, but he didn't expect that when he finished visualizing, it was already past midnight.</p><p></p><p>But the result was gratifying; his soul had entered a new realm.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing looked at his Soul Realm and immediately noticed its expansion, and that "Immortal Tree" was so eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's Immortal Tree currently only had a rough shape and a hint of divine charm; it couldn't be as lifelike as the real thing.</p><p></p><p>The subsequent cultivation of the Visualization Realm was to perfect the visualized object in the Soul Realm until it was exactly the same as the original, possessing a complete divine charm.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the Visualization Realm would be perfected.</p><p></p><p>"Soul breakthrough, but stamina didn't increase. Is it only through martial arts breakthroughs, or does stamina only increase once per major realm? Or is it based on the cultivation path with the highest attainment?" Zhou Qing was a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>But this didn't affect him from entering the Immortal Tree secret realm and starting to chop the tree.</p><p></p><p>After two chops, two glowing orbs appeared in front of Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>[Rare Item: Chicken Blood Stone]</p><p></p><p>[Transformed by the power of the Immortal Tree, a stone soaked in the blood of the Eight Treasures Chicken. Cultivating while holding the Chicken Blood Stone can absorb the power of chicken blood, strengthening one's vitality and enhancing the physical body.]</p><p></p><p>[Weapon: Eagle Beak Spear (Fragment)]</p><p></p><p>[Transformed by the power of the Immortal Tree, a broken weapon. The spearhead has disappeared, leaving only the shaft, which is extremely hard.]</p><p></p><p>Looking at the two items that dropped this time, Zhou Qing's expression was like this.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Old Man's Subway Phone</p><p></p><p>Chicken blood stone, absorbing the power of chicken blood to cultivate?</p><p></p><p>It's really infused with chicken blood.</p><p></p><p>Fragments of a weapon, only the gun barrel remains?</p><p></p><p>Without the gun head, can it really stab someone to death?</p><p></p><p>Although it's strange, the quality of the drops this time is clearly higher than the previous time.</p><p></p><p>The impact of Zhou Qing's soul entering the realm on the drops is evident.</p><p></p><p>Although it didn't increase strength, the quality of the drops improved.</p><p></p><p>"This weapon should correspond to a magic tool, a exclusive weapon for martial artists."</p><p></p><p>The weapons used by martial artists, even if tempered a hundred times, are still mortal tools that can't compare to magic tools.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing felt a bit regretful, why didn't a sword drop? He just happened to want to practice swordsmanship.</p><p></p><p>Putting away the two items, Zhou Qing looked towards the immortal tree.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing didn't understand what happened, he visualized the immortal tree, could there have been some changes that occurred in secret?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"What? You had another dream similar to last time last night, and you successfully visualized?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian looked at Zhou Qing during the day, feeling a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, last night I was in a daze, as if I had the same dream as before." Zhou Qing said:</p><p></p><p>"When I woke up, I found that a tree-shaped visualization object appeared in my soul realm, I'm now at the visualization realm."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing suddenly showed a worried expression and asked:</p><p></p><p>"Master, is there something wrong with my body?"</p><p></p><p>You don't have a problem, but I might...</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian suddenly felt a headache, what exactly is the situation with this disciple of his?</p><p></p><p>Killing ghosts in dreams, breaking through in dreams...</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian exhausted his knowledge and racked his brains thinking about Zhou Qing's matter.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that my disciple doesn't possess a special bloodline, but is the reincarnation of some Dao technique master?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian suddenly thought of this possibility, and the more he thought about it, the more likely it seemed.</p><p></p><p>Legend has it that when Dao techniques are cultivated to an extremely profound level, one can enter and exit the heavens, and even reincarnate.</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian had never seen such a situation, but because of a past experience, he knew that many legends in the world were not actually unfounded or imaginary.</p><p></p><p>"Or could it be that a Dao technique master has taken a liking to Zhou Qing and is transmitting techniques to him remotely in his dreams?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian kept making guesses in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, the matter of cultivating in dreams and breaking through while sleeping was too outrageous.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what do you think is happening to me?" Zhou Qing asked worriedly.</p><p></p><p>"This... I'm not sure either." Bai Tian shook his head and said, "But it should be a good thing, you don't need to worry."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I guess that's all I can do." Zhou Qing sighed.</p><p></p><p>Then he told Bai Tian not to go through the trouble of finding a visualization picture, Bai Tian also thought the same.</p><p></p><p>A person cannot visualize multiple visualization pictures at the same time.</p><p></p><p>"I want to be alone for a while."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing left with a worried look, incredibly realistic.</p><p></p><p>It's settled.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing secretly thought, seeing Bai Tian's expression, he knew that his master had already come up with a reasonable answer for his situation.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the outrageous things happening to him, it doesn't matter if he can't come up with a flawless answer, his master will make one up himself anyway.</p><p></p><p>Actually, Zhou Qing could have not told Bai Tian about entering the visualization realm.</p><p></p><p>But if he didn't say it, Bai Tian would definitely go get a visualization picture for Zhou Qing, but Zhou Qing wouldn't be able to use it, letting Bai Tian's good intentions go to waste.</p><p></p><p>Besides, is it that easy to get a visualization picture from the government?</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister!"</p><p></p><p>"After a night of cultivation, I feel like my flesh has become much more robust, I've made great progress!"</p><p></p><p>"?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue felt something was off, why does this sound familiar?</p><p></p><p>"Really? Let me see."</p><p></p><p>No, how is his body like this!</p><p></p><p>So hard, so firm.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue couldn't take it anymore.</p><p></p><p>Please keep reading, please vote, thank you handsome guys</p>

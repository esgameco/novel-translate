        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 25: Demons</p><p></p><p>After some discussion, everyone gradually perfected the plan and decided on the people to execute it.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue smiled, "When my father went out to wander the jianghu back then, he brought back many good things."</p><p></p><p>"I know where they are kept. I'll go and steal them out. They'll be enough to deceive the world and allow those going in to disguise themselves flawlessly!"</p><p></p><p>That's great, you filial daughter.</p><p></p><p>After finalizing the plan, Bai Ruoyue immediately went to steal the good things her father had brought back from his wanderings in the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>For this operation, almost the entire Taibai Martial Arts School was mobilized. </p><p></p><p>When dealing with evil and crooked people, there's no need to talk about principles. Everyone just needs to stand shoulder to shoulder.</p><p></p><p>After everything was settled, Zhou Qing inwardly sighed with emotion, thinking that the ancients did not deceive him when they said that chivalrous people would violate the law with their martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Those with martial power, whether good or bad people, intentionally or unintentionally, would more or less violate civilized laws.</p><p></p><p>This was the change brought about by power.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't about getting lost in power, but rather their way of thinking unconsciously changed.</p><p></p><p>Martial force became the first and best choice for solving problems.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue quickly returned, after all she had gone to steal things from her own home, so it wasn't far and was very convenient.</p><p></p><p>"We'll wait outside the temple at night," Bai Ruoyue said. </p><p></p><p>"If there really is a problem with Shanshui Temple, immediately send a signal and we'll charge straight in to kill."</p><p></p><p>If the monks of Shanshui Temple were really as they suspected, then they should be killed.</p><p></p><p>After the division of tasks, everyone dispersed to make their own preparations.</p><p></p><p>In the following time, Zhou Qing kept practicing martial arts, not neglecting secret martial arts, Taibai's unique skills, and the Sun Swallowing Technique.</p><p></p><p>Every day, Zhou Qing would practice to his limit before going to do other things.</p><p></p><p>The operation was set for tonight, and there was still some time, so Zhou Qing wouldn't waste it.</p><p></p><p>Without accumulating small steps, one cannot reach a thousand miles.</p><p></p><p>Without gathering small streams, one cannot form rivers and seas.</p><p></p><p>At dusk, Zhou Qing, whose appearance had changed, brought along a "woman" with a slender figure, a rather outstanding appearance, but some unremarkable parts, and headed to Shanshui Temple.</p><p></p><p>"Fourth Senior Brother, be careful in everything after you go in."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, little junior brother, I won't have any problems."</p><p></p><p>This "woman" emitted a gentle... male voice.</p><p></p><p>That's right, the organization had assigned the task of infiltrating Shanshui Temple to Zhou Qing and Taibai's fourth disciple, Su Chang'an.</p><p></p><p>Because Zhou Qing also cultivated the way of souls, he was the best candidate for this operation and could effectively detect some soul techniques.</p><p></p><p>As for the other spot, it fell on Su Chang'an.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing originally looked more handsome, but considering that his cultivation level was a bit low, there would be a slight risk if he cross-dressed as a woman.</p><p></p><p>But if he went in as a man, there would be no problem. The monks of Shanshui Temple wouldn't make a move on men.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was because they didn't have such preferences or because it was inconvenient, that was unknown...</p><p></p><p>The disguise items Bai Ruoyue had taken from her father were very magical. Su Chang'an actually looked like a real woman, just without much curves.</p><p></p><p>When Zhou Qing saw the effects of these disguise items, he secretly thought that his master must have often changed his appearance when wandering the jianghu in the past.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing kept his eyes forward the whole way, trying not to look at Su Chang'an, afraid he would laugh.</p><p></p><p>He had received professional training and definitely wouldn't laugh.</p><p></p><p>He still remembered Su Chang'an's bewilderment and embarrassment when this task fell on his head.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, my cultivation level is low, otherwise this matter would probably have fallen on me.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou Qing also handed Su Chang'an an item, half a milky white jade pendant.</p><p></p><p>This was a fragment of a magic tool that had fallen when Zhou Qing was chopping trees before. The Pure Heart Jade Pendant had the effect of calming the mind, removing distracting thoughts, and resisting illusions.</p><p></p><p>Magic tools that fell from immortal trees would automatically bind to Zhou Qing, but fragments of magic tools wouldn't, so Zhou Qing could give them away.</p><p></p><p>Sure, here's the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing decided to lend this piece of magical artifact to Su Chang'an to use, to give him an extra layer of protection.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was his fourth senior brother, and Zhou Qing didn't want him to... lose his body.</p><p></p><p>"Fourth senior brother, this is my family's heirloom treasure. Carrying it with you has the effect of removing distracting thoughts and calming the mind." Zhou Qing said:</p><p></p><p>"This time, facing the techniques of cultivators, you'll have more assurance carrying this jade pendant."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing himself was a cultivator and had real magical artifacts. This fragment wouldn't be of much use to him in this operation.</p><p></p><p>Su Chang'an refused multiple times, but finally accepted this piece of the magical artifact under Zhou Qing's insistence, agreeing to return it to Zhou Qing after this incident was over.</p><p></p><p>Rubbing the warmth in his hand, Su Chang'an said in surprise:</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, your family's heirloom treasure is no ordinary item. It seems your ancestors were also extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>Of course, descendants of Yan and Huang, people of the dragon, how could the ancestors be ordinary?</p><p></p><p>Entering Shanshui Temple, the two of them directly sought out the monks in the temple.</p><p></p><p>After explaining their purpose, the monk called Neng Fa glanced at Su Chang'an, didn't find anything unusual, then agreed to Zhou Qing and his companion's request to stay, leading them to the rear courtyard.</p><p></p><p>There were two separate courtyards here, the left for men to stay, the right belonged to women.</p><p></p><p>After explaining, Neng Fa directly left.</p><p></p><p>After returning to his room, Su Chang'an discovered a small incense burner on the table, with a stick of red incense burning inside, the entire room filled with a fragrance.</p><p></p><p>He sniffed it, inhaling some of the fragrance, and felt a trace of abnormality in his body.</p><p></p><p>The jade pendant Zhou Qing gave him emitted a faint white light, icy and mind-clearing.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the incense on the table, Su Chang'an secretly thought there was indeed something strange, and wondered how his junior brother was doing.</p><p></p><p>In Zhou Qing's room, an incense stick was also lit, only it was earthy yellow in color.</p><p></p><p>This incense didn't bring any discomfort to Zhou Qing, only a faint refreshing fragrance.</p><p></p><p>As the night grew deeper, Zhou Qing sat awake in his chair, his head suddenly nodding, feeling a bit heavy.</p><p></p><p>"Sleepy?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing suddenly raised his head and looked at the incense on the table, two-thirds of it already burned.</p><p></p><p>There was a problem with this incense!</p><p></p><p>"As a cultivator, I have this kind of reaction after smelling this incense for a long time."</p><p></p><p>"If an ordinary person smelled this incense, they would probably fall into a deep sleep directly, and no matter how big a disturbance occurred during that time, they wouldn't wake up."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhou Qing suddenly noticed some movement outside the house.</p><p></p><p>There were footsteps, and quite a few of them, probably around ten people, accompanied by laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, every night this old man has to work hard, these little ladies are almost draining this Meridian Realm martial artist dry."</p><p></p><p>"If you're not willing, you can give your share to me."</p><p></p><p>"Get lost, today I want three at once, right next to their husbands too!"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, you really live up to being a deflowering thief, you know how to play!"</p><p></p><p>"These stupid women, begging gods and Buddhas for a child, delivering themselves to us to play with for free. If they get pregnant, they'll have to raise our seed in the future. Just thinking about it makes me happy. Before becoming a monk, where would there be such good things."</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, there's a little lady today, looks cold, quite tasty, just that chest, that butt, the same as a man, one look and there's no desire."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Really the same as a man? Then I'm interested, I've long wanted to try the taste of those little male entertainers."</p><p></p><p>They didn't lower their voices, seemingly certain that the people in the rear courtyard had all been drugged unconscious and wouldn't wake up.</p><p></p><p>They had done this kind of thing who knows how many times, experienced, and wouldn't have any accidents.</p><p></p><p>Hearing those filthy words outside the door, Zhou Qing was burning with anger, wishing he could punch the people outside to death with one blow.</p><p></p><p>What the hell kind of world was this, how could there be so many demons wearing human skin!</p>

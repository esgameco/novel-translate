        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 21: Insufficiency</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue's words made Zhou Qing feel even more at ease. The decision to come to Taibai Martial Arts School to learn martial arts was truly wonderful.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yuantao said with concern, "Junior Brother, your injuries are not light this time. You need to rest well for a few more days."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing nodded. His injuries were actually just a minor problem.</p><p></p><p>Others could only recover from injuries, but he had a golden finger.</p><p></p><p>Chopping a few more axes would give him everything he needed, and it wouldn't delay his cultivation at all. He would soon be full of vitality.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow, when he returned to the martial arts school, he would give them a little Zhou-style shock.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, what's the deal with that Yang Xing?" Zhou Qing asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Him?" Bai Ruoyue explained, "Four years ago, he was a senior disciple of our martial arts school. He had good talent, and Dad originally planned to take him as a disciple."</p><p></p><p>"However, after investigating his situation, it was discovered that this person had some problems, so it was abandoned. In the end, he left Taibai and went to Tenglong Martial Arts School, where he was favored by the Tenglong School Master."</p><p></p><p>"Problems with the person?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, before accepting him as a disciple, an investigation was conducted. His background was not bad, but he usually hung out with a group of unscrupulous friends and committed many mistakes."</p><p></p><p>"The most serious time, he directly caused someone's death, but his family had money and power, so they smoothed things over and got him out."</p><p></p><p>Four years ago, this Yang Xing was probably only twelve years old. To be able to do such things at this age...</p><p></p><p>It was chilling.</p><p></p><p>Four years had passed, and Yang Xing was able to directly rob people on the road. Although there was a reason for hating Taibai Martial Arts School, he must have still not turned over a new leaf.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he would block Zhou Qing. It turned out he was really a brainless idiot!</p><p></p><p>Yang Xing must have held a grudge when he left Taibai four years ago. Seeing Zhou Qing, a Taibai disciple, outside the town, it would be strange if he didn't make a move.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing felt a little fortunate. Fortunately, this person was not his martial brother. Otherwise, he couldn't imagine how many disastrous things would happen.</p><p></p><p>"That Yang Xing has talent. In four years, he has cultivated to the completion of flesh and skin, but unfortunately, his character is lacking," Zhang Yuantao said.</p><p></p><p>"In the many years since Master founded the martial arts school, he has also encountered several such people. In the end, they all left the martial arts school and sought other paths."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing thought of a point, "If such people defect to other sects, won't our martial arts school's martial arts be leaked?"</p><p></p><p>"It's just flesh and skin training methods plus a few basic fighting techniques, nothing too important. It's not the foundation of our Taibai," Bai Ruoyue smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Although the junior brothers have not mastered the secret martial arts, the training methods for the flesh and skin realm are better than the elephant, ox, and crane practices."</p><p></p><p>"When you go to Tianyue County City one day, Junior Brother, you will find that things like flesh and skin training methods and basic fighting techniques are directly sold publicly by some business associations."</p><p></p><p>Tianyue County City, Zhou Qing silently remembered this name in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, little junior brother, it's fine in Heiyun Town, but if you leave Heiyun Town one day, be careful when you encounter other martial artists outside, especially disciples from other martial arts schools."</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue earnestly warned Zhou Qing, "The three major martial arts schools are inherently competitive, and our Taibai's relationship with the other two major martial arts schools is not good. When my dad founded the martial arts school back then, he had no shortage of conflicts with them."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Great Qi government has stipulated that martial artists are prohibited from killing each other privately, this rule is effective at most only in towns and cities. Martial artists are ultimately uncontrollable."</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue and the others carefully warned Zhou Qing about some things he needed to pay attention to when traveling in the jianghu in the future.</p><p></p><p>Once one leaves civilized lands, peace will also be far away.</p><p></p><p>During this process, the other martial brothers also left one after another.</p><p></p><p>The following is the full English translation of the provided Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They had their own things to do.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that this time, Junior Brother, you only encountered a Flesh and Skin Great Accomplishment. The enemy wasn't strong, you..."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Bai Ruoyue's expression became a bit odd.</p><p></p><p>What did she just say?</p><p></p><p>Only a Flesh and Skin Great Accomplishment?</p><p></p><p>This isn't right! Isn't Zhou Qing at the initial stage of Flesh and Skin?</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, what were the cultivation levels of the other two who attacked?"</p><p></p><p>"One was the same as me, and the other was at Flesh and Skin Small Accomplishment."</p><p></p><p>"So you killed your way out while being surrounded and attacked by two cultivators of higher realms and one of the same realm as you, and even beat them up like that?" Bai Ruoyue raised her voice.</p><p></p><p>Previously, she was too concerned and confused, and Zhou Qing didn't explain clearly, so she didn't notice this blind spot for a while.</p><p></p><p>Now that she noticed, Bai Ruoyue was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing blinked his eyes, "Yeah, what's the matter? Is there a problem?"</p><p></p><p>What do you mean by is there a problem! The biggest problem is that you didn't get beaten to death!</p><p></p><p>"How did you do it?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing honestly said, "It's very simple. I just fought and fought, and then they couldn't take it anymore."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, simple.</p><p></p><p>"You were fighting above your cultivation level, and it was two levels higher, plus it was one against three."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing still maintained his innocent and confused expression, "Is there a problem with fighting above my level and against multiple opponents?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, can't you do it?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue was speechless and fell silent.</p><p></p><p>You can go. I'm temporarily expelling you from the sect. Your words are too annoying. My chest hurts from the anger.</p><p></p><p>This junior brother always suddenly gives her many surprises, regardless of whether she can accept them or not.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing watched Bai Ruoyue's back and laughed happily.</p><p></p><p>Although Senior Sister is older, she's only eighteen years old. Sometimes, teasing her is quite fun.</p><p></p><p>After walking out of Zhou Qing's sight, Bai Ruoyue suddenly wrinkled her nose, waved her fists, and snorted twice, then felt a bit happy and put her hands on her hips.</p><p></p><p>My junior brother is really amazing. Good job.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing lay on the chair alone, recalling today's battle.</p><p></p><p>Relative to his cultivation level, the battle results were glorious, but Zhou Qing also discovered some of his own shortcomings.</p><p></p><p>The first is that his cultivation time was too short. Although he had already worked extremely hard, it was only four days after all, and his cultivation level wasn't high.</p><p></p><p>This problem is actually very easy to solve. Either endure over time or exchange resources for time.</p><p></p><p>The second is in terms of soul.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing had the cultivation level but no techniques to use.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual impact doesn't count as a technique. Whose spiritual impact is a skill?</p><p></p><p>This is only the most basic application of soul power, and it doesn't work well when facing cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators don't cultivate the soul, but their willpower isn't bad.</p><p></p><p>Real techniques have various miraculous effects, such as the Ghost Control Technique.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's foundation in techniques is extremely lacking.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing still has a way to solve the problem of low cultivation level, but he currently has no solution for the problem of having no techniques to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>The immortal tree might drop them, but Zhou Qing hasn't seen it so far.</p><p></p><p>For cultivator training, the heritage of Taibai Martial Hall is sufficient.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that Zhou Qing had a piece of a spiritual weapon in his hand, the entry-level supreme skills of Taibai would actually be his main means of dealing with enemies.</p><p></p><p>He doesn't lack martial arts techniques, but he lacks cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Master doesn't cultivate the soul and doesn't have accumulation in this aspect..."</p><p></p><p>"I either have to wait to chop down trees in the future, or I have to go to other places to find them..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing decided to work hard and see if he could make up for this deficiency.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts and techniques, he needs to grasp both and be proficient in both.</p>

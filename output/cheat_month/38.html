            <p>Chapter 38: Shrimp Soldiers and Crab Generals</p><p></p><p>"Just as you are nominally in charge of the Bureau of Ghosts and Gods, and help them handle matters related to ghosts and gods, the Garrison Command occasionally also asks other warriors to do things for them." </p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue explained, "In Heiyun Town, the warriors of our three major martial arts schools are the main partners of the Garrison Command."</p><p></p><p>"For some matters, they will also prioritize coming to us for help. We can gain both battles and treasures in this process."</p><p></p><p>"Battle is the greatest enjoyment for a warrior!"</p><p></p><p>I was about to take off my pants, but the enjoyment you're talking about is just this?</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister, you're too disappointing!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing also understood, isn't this just outsourcing?</p><p></p><p>Damn it, I'm so envious of the leaders of these major forces.</p><p></p><p>In the future, I, Zhou Qing, also want to be the one calling the shots! I also want to be the boss!</p><p></p><p>"When there are suitable commissions later, I'll take you to experience it. Warriors ultimately still need to grow faster through battles."</p><p></p><p>Although Zhou Qing didn't have much desire to go, Senior Sister is really good, she truly thinks of me when there are benefits.</p><p></p><p>Compared to that silly goose Yunduo, Senior Sister is more likable.</p><p></p><p>Beautiful, kind-hearted, and easy to tease, although with a little tendency for violence, but that's not a big problem.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, Senior Sister makes too much sense.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue reminded again, "That Yunduo is the beloved daughter of the current head of the Yun family. Although our Taibai Martial Arts School is not afraid of the Yun family, you shouldn't deliberately bully her either."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing felt insulted, "How could I possibly bully a 15-year-old girl!"</p><p></p><p>"You say things so irritatingly, I'm afraid you'll make her cry." Bai Ruoyue clapped her hands and left here.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing wanted to catch up to Senior Sister and reason with her, but suddenly a hand appeared behind him and pressed on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing turned his head and saw a big face.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, you're here?"</p><p></p><p>"Second Senior Brother..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing wanted to cry but had no tears. He finally understood why Bai Ruoyue suddenly left.</p><p></p><p>If she didn't leave, she would definitely be "harassed" by Shen Long again.</p><p></p><p>But the problem is, now it's his turn to be "harassed".</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing asked the other senior brothers about Shen Long and found out that this person is too obsessed with fighting.</p><p></p><p>He not only likes to spar with his senior sisters and brothers, but also often goes to other martial arts schools to fight with people in the name of exchange.</p><p></p><p>It made the warriors of other martial arts schools all afraid.</p><p></p><p>Sparring is not strange, but it's very strange for you to come to the door every day for exchange.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing walked out of the martial arts school and twisted his neck. At this moment, his mood was quite pleasant.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing discovered yesterday that during battles, the medicinal power of the Nine Apertures Golden Pill would flow out more and he would absorb it more thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>Every impact on his body would cause a reaction from the Nine Apertures Golden Pill.</p><p></p><p>So although he felt a bit helpless about Shen Long's belligerent personality, Shen Long's behavior undoubtedly hit the spot for Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>Battle makes me go crazy.</p><p></p><p>After a few battles, Shen Long became more and more satisfied with this junior brother Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Zhou Qing went to Yunjiang again. Shen Long specially asked Shen Yu to take care of Zhou Qing, and the lively Shen Yu excitedly followed Zhou Qing.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Moral Pill: Feather Soul Pill]</p><p></p><p>[Consuming it can nourish the soul and restore spirit]</p><p></p><p>[Magic Tool: Water Avoidance Bead (Fragment)]</p><p></p><p>[A fragment of the Water Avoidance Bead, inheriting some of its abilities. Can avoid ordinary water for a limited time.]</p><p></p><p>[Player already possesses a Water Avoidance Bead fragment. Two fragments can be fused.]</p><p></p><p>Seeing these two drops, Zhou Qing perked up.</p><p></p><p>Feather Soul Pill, a widely used elixir that can be used during battles and cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Visualization consumes spiritual power. Once spiritual power is exhausted, one can no longer continue visualizing and can only wait for spiritual power to slowly recover.</p><p></p><p>The process of cultivating visualization charts is also a process of tempering and improving spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>With the Feather Soul Pill, Zhou Qing can quickly recover by taking the pill after his spiritual power is exhausted, and then continue visualizing.</p><p></p><p>The second drop made Zhou Qing even more pleasantly surprised. He actually got another Water Avoidance Bead fragment!</p><p></p><p>Without a second word, Zhou Qing fused the two fragments together.</p><p></p><p>[Magic Tool: Water Avoidance Bead (Fragment)]</p><p></p><p>[A more complete Avoid Water Bead fragment, the water avoidance ability has been enhanced to a certain extent, the water avoidance time has been extended to a certain extent, and can control ordinary water to a certain degree]</p><p></p><p>"The two fragments are still not complete after merging?" Zhou Qing was a little disappointed, not expecting that this special magic tool was still incomplete.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know how many fragments it takes to fuse into a complete Avoid Water Bead..."</p><p></p><p>If it was a complete Avoid Water Bead, as long as the food problem could be solved, Zhou Qing would have no problem staying underwater all the time.</p><p></p><p>[Placed in the Soul Homeland, it can refine the spirit and purify the soul (there is an upper limit to the purifying power of refinement)]</p><p></p><p>[Talisman: Bright Light Talisman]</p><p></p><p>[A Taoist talisman, containing the Bright Light Spell. When activated, it can burst out a strong exotic sunlight, obscuring the vision of the souls and bodies of living beings within a certain range, except for the owner of the talisman. It is a one-time use talisman.]</p><p></p><p>The second time chopping the tree, two more things dropped. The Purifying Spirit Stone at first glance was an auxiliary cultivation item that could make the spirit more refined and the soul purer.</p><p></p><p>This was extremely beneficial for both cultivation and spell battles, allowing Zhou Qing to cultivate faster than others and be stronger than cultivators of the same level.</p><p></p><p>Only by accumulating more on a daily basis and making one's foundation deeper could one ultimately possess far superior strength compared to those of the same level.</p><p></p><p>As for this Bright Light Talisman...</p><p></p><p>"Flashbang?"</p><p></p><p>This term popped up in Zhou Qing's mind.</p><p></p><p>Bursting out bright light to obscure vision, isn't this a flashbang!</p><p></p><p>It's just a supernatural version that can even block the vision of souls.</p><p></p><p>In the morning, Zhou Qing studied knowledge with Lu Qingmo for an hour. Lu Qingmo did not break his word and began to teach Zhou Qing Taoist arts.</p><p></p><p>The first was the Ghost Control Technique, the easiest to learn among Taoist arts of the same level.</p><p></p><p>This Taoist art had incantations and talisman drawing methods, but if cultivated to a proficient level, talismans were not necessary.</p><p></p><p>"There are three wonders in the sky: sun, moon and stars; ghosts and gods are shocked through heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingmo carefully explained this Taoist art to Zhou Qing, who had a sudden enlightenment and understood all the previous puzzles.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing learned very quickly and basically did not need Lu Qingmo to worry much, which made Lu Qingmo very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>A good "teacher" and a good "disciple" were indeed a perfect match.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Lu Qingmo said to Zhou Qing,</p><p></p><p>"In the future, if you have the opportunity, you can also offer to keep a ghost or god."</p><p></p><p>"With my cultivation speed, even if I keep a ghost, it won't be able to help me much, right?"</p><p></p><p>"That statement is wrong." Lu Qingmo shook his head, "If you travel the world in the future, carrying a ghost with you can help you in many ways."</p><p></p><p>"When burning incense for cultivation, it can replace the incense and stand guard for you; when setting up an altar for rituals, it can arrange everything for you. Some cultivators even let their contracted ghosts learn incense making and refining materials, either for self-use or for sale."</p><p></p><p>"If a ghost is well-trained, even if it can't help you fight, it can assist your cultivation. Moreover, it's impossible for you to personally handle all trivial matters."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing suddenly became interested.</p><p></p><p>It didn't really matter if their cultivation couldn't keep up with him, because so far it seemed no one could keep up with him.</p><p></p><p>He didn't look at talent when making friends anyway, as no one had better talent than him.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing kept this matter in mind.</p><p></p><p>After completing today's martial arts and Taoist arts lessons, Zhou Qing couldn't wait to go to the Cloud River.</p><p></p><p>The Avoid Water Bead fragment had a small upgrade, and Zhou Qing was already eager to experience it.</p><p></p><p>Going to the Cloud River for adventure, one could obtain spiritual plants and battle water savage beasts, which was of great help to the improvement of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This time, Bai Ruoyue went with Zhou Qing. She was also a little curious about Zhou Qing's special ability.</p><p></p><p>When Zhou Qing jumped into the Cloud River and demonstrated his abilities to Bai Ruoyue, Bai Ruoyue was extremely amazed.</p><p></p><p>So magical, I really want it too.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing dove deep into the river, but as soon as he came down, before he could start exploring, he discovered two strange creatures.</p><p></p><p>It was a red crab and a green prawn. What was surprising was that they were actually holding guns and forks as weapons in their hands!</p><p></p><p>They also spotted Zhou Qing at the same time, with the crab's eyes and the prawn's eyes both staring at Zhou Qing, flashing with the light of intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Crabs and prawns, intelligence and weapons, the sense of déjà vu was so strong.</p>

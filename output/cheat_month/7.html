        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 7: Unsolved Mystery: How Strong is Zhou Qing at His Peak?</p><p></p><p>Now it was equivalent to the older students in a school mocking and ridiculing the new students in various ways. Undoubtedly, this was almost the same as bullying, and Zhou Qing chose to say no to bullying.</p><p></p><p>Those practicing in this hall were all ordinary disciples, while the advanced disciples were in other halls.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Bai Ruoyue had told him that this batch of ordinary disciples was still some distance away from the Flesh Boundary, and none of them were on the verge of a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>So what was he afraid of?</p><p></p><p>When practicing martial arts, one couldn't possibly practice in the direction of becoming a turtle hiding its head.</p><p></p><p>Keeping a low profile?</p><p></p><p>At least in this hall of the Taibai Martial Arts School, it did not exist.</p><p></p><p>"You fellow, you're very arrogant." A youth in his early twenties gritted his teeth, feeling that he had been greatly insulted.</p><p></p><p>"My name is Zhao Jiefei. I've been in the martial arts school for three months. Let me, as your senior brother, give you some proper guidance."</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to tell me your name." Zhou Qing said indifferently, "You won't leave any mark in my life."</p><p></p><p>"After today, I will only remember that someone was defeated by my hands. As for what their names are, I won't care."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Jiefei's face turned red with anger, and he shouted as he rushed over.</p><p></p><p>The hall master's disciples, who were quietly observing the situation, glanced at each other and did not stop them.</p><p></p><p>Since it was not a group fight, but a one-on-one contest, it was allowed.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even if it was one against many, it was allowed as long as you had the ability.</p><p></p><p>They only needed to pay attention not to cause major injuries or deaths.</p><p></p><p>After practicing martial arts for three months, Zhao Jiefei had naturally completed his body tempering. Although he had not broken through, his physical strength was quite good.</p><p></p><p>However, facing the fists of this senior disciple, Zhou Qing did not dodge or evade, but met him head-on.</p><p></p><p>He didn't use any boxing techniques, just the most direct physical collision.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing did not take a single step back, and Zhao Jiefei was directly thrown to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Do you understand the value of a physique comparable to a martial artist who has just entered the Flesh Boundary?</p><p></p><p>Martial artists and non-martial artists are in different worlds.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's overall strength was naturally far inferior to a true martial artist, but dealing with these disciples who only knew one kind of practice was a piece of cake.</p><p></p><p>A punch and it was over.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing didn't even look at the fallen Zhao Jiefei, but said to the few people he had named earlier:</p><p></p><p>"You few, come at me together."</p><p></p><p>"I'm in a hurry."</p><p></p><p>The huge hall was silent, and a pin drop could be heard.</p><p></p><p>The few people named by Zhou Qing subconsciously took a few steps back. As for attacking Zhou Qing?</p><p></p><p>They completely lost the courage.</p><p></p><p>Those who dared to openly mock and ridicule Zhou Qing after he said he didn't become a hall master's disciple, how much backbone could you expect them to have? It was unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhou Qing smiled. That's it?</p><p></p><p>Actually, Zhou Qing also felt that these few people were quite brainless.</p><p></p><p>He went to the backyard where only the hall master's disciples could go. Even if he wasn't accepted as a disciple by the hall master, it was obvious that he had a relationship with the martial arts school.</p><p></p><p>But these people only looked at the surface and dared to jump out.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou Qing was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>He was very clear that the stupidity of some people was beyond your imagination. In his previous life, after working for a few years, he had a deep understanding of this.</p><p></p><p>But stupid people were after all a minority. Most people didn't say anything bad just now, and some people didn't care about Zhou Qing at all.</p><p></p><p>The few hall master's disciples were amazed in their hearts, directly feeling the uniqueness of Zhou Qing's physique.</p><p></p><p>The other disciples were shocked and also very puzzled as to why Zhou Qing was so fierce.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he brought skills with him when he entered the school?</p><p></p><p>The most confused one was Li Wu. An "old man" he didn't care about at all actually knocked down a senior disciple with one punch.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of his previous performance, Li Wu felt a little unnatural.</p><p></p><p>Especially when he saw Wang Taotao looking at Zhou Qing with admiration, Li Wu's heart ached even more.</p><p></p><p>It should have been me...</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing, come here!" </p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue suddenly appeared. Zhou Qing patted his hands and walked over.</p><p></p><p>As for what happened just now...</p><p></p><p>He defeated a person. What was that person's name?</p><p></p><p>Already forgotten.</p><p></p><p>The disciples in this hall once again watched Zhou Qing leave, but their state of mind was different from the last time.</p><p></p><p>Before, it was curiosity about the newcomer.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Bai, is it time to eat?" Zhou Qing asked.</p><p></p><p>"..." Bai Ruoyue's footsteps paused. "The meal can wait. First, I'll take you to see my father."</p><p></p><p>When the two arrived at the backyard, Bai Tian was already waiting.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing." Bai Tian looked at Zhou Qing, his eyes deep.</p><p></p><p>"Were you attacked by ghosts last night?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing's heart jumped. They could even investigate this?</p><p></p><p>"Not only last night, but I have been haunted by ghosts for six days." Zhou Qing answered truthfully:</p><p></p><p>"It was only last night that I escaped the danger. It was also because of this experience that I made up my mind to practice martial arts to strengthen myself."</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian stared at Zhou Qing, and Zhou Qing only felt his hair standing on end.</p><p></p><p>"You are just an ordinary person. How..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"How can we deal with the ghost?" Bai Tian asked directly.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know either," Zhou Qing said. "At the most critical moment last night, I seemed to have had a dream, and in the dream, I seemed to have gone to a place."</p><p></p><p>"After the dream ended, I found that I could harm that ghost."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing didn't make things up. He did go to a place last night, but he just described the process a bit vaguely.</p><p></p><p>But if you examine it closely, what he said was all true.</p><p></p><p>He had a clear conscience, right?</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian didn't speak. Zhou Qing didn't lie.</p><p></p><p>"Living beings haunted by ghosts will have their spirit wither and body wasted, but you don't look like that."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhou Qing smiled helplessly. "The Pavilion Master hasn't seen what I looked like a few days ago. I really looked like I was about to die those days."</p><p></p><p>"Just like the bookish scholars who had their yang energy drained in the absurd legends."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, there was a shocked look in Bai Tian's eyes.</p><p></p><p>When he first learned about Zhou Qing's situation, he could remain calm. When facing that Young Master Meng, he was also very calm.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, after hearing Zhou Qing's words, he could no longer remain calm.</p><p></p><p>"Are you saying that your current body... is in a state after being eroded by a ghost?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing nodded. It was not a problem to say that.</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue exclaimed in shock, "After being eroded by a ghost and suffering great damage to the primordial qi, the physical body can still be comparable to a warrior who has just entered the Flesh Realm. If six days ago, when the primordial qi was at its peak, how terrifying would your physical body be?"</p><p></p><p>This was what Bai Tian was shocked about.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing was stunned. How terrifying was the body of "Zhou Qing" who had not been eroded by a ghost?</p><p></p><p>How could he answer this question?</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing thought about it. To exaggerate a bit, it should be so terrifying that your martial arts hall would be afraid of ruining its reputation and wouldn't even want to accept him as a disciple...</p><p></p><p>The original body had no talent for martial arts to begin with, and the six years of orphan life had greatly affected his physical growth. His foundation could be said to be extremely poor.</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian and Bai Ruoyue felt deeply sorry for Zhou Qing and also very regretful. They had missed a peerless genius.</p><p></p><p>The damage and loss caused by the erosion of ghosts were all fundamental. It was very easy to make up for some of it afterwards, but it was very difficult to completely make up for it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the expressions of the two, Zhou Qing knew that the three of them were not communicating on the same wavelength, and a misunderstanding had arisen.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing thought about it and didn't explain.</p><p></p><p>Let them think that his current self was his self after suffering great damage to his primordial qi. Otherwise, he would have to make an effort to explain how he made up for the origin.</p><p></p><p>And not being able to witness what Zhou Qing was like at the "peak" of his primordial qi became Bai Tian and Bai Ruoyue's eternal regret.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing, are you willing to become my disciple?" Bai Tian suddenly said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>He would never miss a disciple with such talent.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing had no hesitation and immediately bowed. He didn't need to kneel down and kowtow.</p><p></p><p>"Good. From today onwards, you are my seventh disciple."</p><p></p><p>"The Taibai Lineage does not have many rules, but there are three sect rules that are iron laws and must not be violated."</p><p></p><p>"It is forbidden to betray one's master and destroy one's ancestors! It is forbidden to harm fellow disciples! It is forbidden to kill the innocent indiscriminately!"</p><p></p><p>"If you violate the sect rules, I will personally take action and execute you."</p><p></p><p>Bai Tian's words were loud and clear, and extremely sharp.</p><p></p><p>"This disciple will strictly abide by the sect rules," Zhou Qing replied with utmost seriousness.</p><p></p><p>"Little junior brother, I am your senior sister," Bai Ruoyue said with a smile beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Senior sister," Zhou Qing naturally obediently changed his address.</p><p></p><p>"Joining my sect, you don't need to feel restrained," Bai Tian said. "If one day in the future your achievements surpass mine, you can also acknowledge other masters to continue guiding you."</p><p></p><p>"In this aspect, whether it's warriors or cultivators, they are not rigid."</p><p></p><p>It was very normal for a person with sufficient talent to acknowledge several masters in their lifetime.</p><p></p><p>The blue comes from the indigo plant but is bluer than the plant itself. This is the best praise for a master.</p><p></p><p>However, while having multiple masters is fine, betraying one's master and destroying one's ancestors is absolutely not allowed.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have joined my sect, I should naturally pass on martial arts to you," Bai Tian continued.</p><p></p><p>"You have exceptional talent and have a good chance of learning a secret martial art that I have."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing asked, "I won't practice the three methods of Elephant, Ox, and Crane?"</p><p></p><p>"The secret martial art I have is of a higher level than those three methods. If you can learn it, your achievements will far surpass the three methods."</p><p></p><p>"Of my six previous disciples, only Ruoyue has mastered it."</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue slightly puffed out her chest to increase her presence.</p><p></p><p>"And even Ruoyue has taken some shortcuts."</p><p></p><p>Bai Ruoyue shrank her chest again.</p><p></p><p>"But there is one thing you need to remember," Bai Tian suddenly became much more solemn.</p><p></p><p>"If you can master the secret martial art, then in the future when you venture out into the jianghu, you must not reveal anything about the secret martial art."</p><p></p><p>"And you must not tell others that you are my disciple."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Why does this sound so familiar?</p><p></p><p>Have I become a monkey?</p>

        <h1>Chapter 215</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' wishes to establish a new dynasty!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been guided by a great master, and his cultivation has made some progress!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been guided by a great master, and his strength has increased somewhat!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by martial artists *36 times!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain *18 martial artists at the Refine Skin realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain *9 martial artists at the Refine Blood realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain *9 martial artists at the Refine Bone realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has deepened his understanding of the true meaning of the Heavenly Saber in the life-and-death battles, and his strength has increased!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"That's about it!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression became clear after seeing the information about Gu Yang conquering the Nine Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Prefectures have submitted.</p><p></p><p>Establishing a new dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng could be certain that this move would definitely trigger a new achievement.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Yang became a regional lord in the past, the achievement triggered had provided him with many rewards. Now that he has consolidated the Nine Prefectures, the rewards would surely be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Two days later.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng set out for the Guangyang Palace.</p><p></p><p>Inside the palace.</p><p></p><p>The two met.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng asked, "Now that the Nine Prefectures have been consolidated, when do you plan to ascend the throne and establish the capital?"</p><p></p><p>"The eighth of the ninth month is an auspicious day. I plan to announce the establishment of the dynasty on that day, and I intend to make the city of Guangyang Prefecture the capital of the new dynasty!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang did not hesitate much and directly expressed his views.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"That's fine!"</p><p></p><p>Although the capitals of past dynasties have always been in the Central Plains, it is not an absolute rule. Although the Central Plains are the center of the Nine Prefectures, that is the accumulation of past dynasties. Since Gu Yang has chosen to establish the capital in Guangyang Prefecture, there is no problem with that.</p><p></p><p>In time,</p><p></p><p>the Qingyun State may also become the center of the Nine Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>Now it is already July.</p><p></p><p>The eighth of the ninth month.</p><p></p><p>It is not long away.</p><p></p><p>In the following time, Gu Qingfeng would stay in the Guangyang Palace, as he would not allow any problems to arise at this stage.</p><p></p><p>Over the past two months,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang has been busy arranging many matters.</p><p></p><p>Establishing a dynasty</p><p></p><p>is not as simple as that.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two months later.</p><p></p><p>In the prefecture capital.</p><p></p><p>Many martial arts sects and immortal families have sent their powerful experts to attend. At this moment, the entire Guangyang Prefecture has become a gathering of influential figures.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>no one has caused any disturbance.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Yang intends to establish the capital in Guangyang Prefecture, which has been heavily guarded. Any attempt to cause trouble would be suppressed immediately.</p><p></p><p>As a result,</p><p></p><p>no one dares to create chaos.</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p></p><p>Guangyang Prefecture has a force that stands above all others - the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>The revered Martial Saint Gu Qingfeng, who is now known as the strongest in the world, is the current lord of the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>Not only ordinary martial forces, but even the ancient and immortal sects and families do not dare to offend him.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>despite the gathering of powerful figures and the influx of martial artists in Guangyang Prefecture, there is not much disturbance.</p><p></p><p>"The aura is soaring to the heavens!"</p><p></p><p>"The might is like a tiger roaming the vast lands!"</p><p></p><p>"The elite troops under his command are indeed formidable."</p><p></p><p>The speaker was Li Xuankong, the current lord of the Li Family in the Huangzhou region.</p><p></p><p>After Li Xuanji's demise in the Central Plains, the Li Family had experienced much internal turmoil, until Li Xuankong emerged and displayed his peak Transformation Realm cultivation, suppressing all the unrest and succeeding as the family's lord.</p><p></p><p>Now,</p><p></p><p>as Gu Yang is about to ascend the throne, Li Xuankong has come in person.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Gu Family is currently a powerful force that dominates the world. Although the Li Family is an immortal lineage, it has suffered heavy losses in the battle in the Central Plains.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Li Xuankong naturally wants to curry favor with the Gu Family.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, he cannot afford to offend them.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise,</p><p></p><p>the Li Family in the Huangzhou region may also face troubles.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>a Li Family elder spoke in a deep voice, "Judging from the military flags, that should be the Heavenly Dipper Army."</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Dipper Army, no wonder they have such a terrifying aura!"</p><p></p><p>When Li Xuankong heard the name, his expression became more solemn.</p><p></p><p>The reputation of the Heavenly Dipper Army</p><p></p><p>is now resounding throughout the Nine Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>The most famous battle they were involved in was when their commander Shi Zhen led 36,000 Heavenly Dipper Army troops and decisively defeated a 500,000-strong army, even slaying a peak True Meaning Sect Master in the process.</p><p></p><p>This news had firmly established the Heavenly Dipper Army's formidable reputation.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p></p><p>in a large-scale battle, ordinary martial artists can only play a role similar to that of common soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, to defeat an enemy force ten times their own size and even slay a peak True Meaning Sect Master is something that ordinary people cannot accomplish.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>since that battle,</p><p></p><p>people all over the world have come to know the name of the Heavenly Dipper Army.</p><p></p><p>This is the most elite military force under the command of the Guangyang King. Although their numbers are not large, they are enough to strike fear in the hearts of others.</p><p></p><p>In the later stages, Gu Yang's rapid conquest of the Nine Prefectures was also largely due to the contributions of the Heavenly Dipper Army.</p><p></p><p>Wherever they went, the enemy forces would often surrender without a fight.</p><p></p><p>Even the occasional resisters were swiftly eliminated on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Even with Li Xuankong's current strength, he does not wish to directly confront the Heavenly Dipper Army.</p><p></p><p>After all, even if he has the confidence to win, he would have to pay a heavy price.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>what truly concerns Li Xuankong is not the Heavenly Dipper Army, but the terrifying saber intent that is pressing down on the prefecture capital.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary martial artists cannot detect the existence of such saber intent, only those who have mastered the True Meaning can truly sense this extraordinary saber intent.</p><p></p><p>In Li Xuankong's eyes,</p><p></p><p>he sees a divine saber spanning the sky above the Guangyang Prefecture capital, as if any of his actions would result in that saber descending to strike him down.</p><p></p><p>Even though Li Xuankong has already reached the Transformation Realm, when faced with this transcendent divine saber, he still feels a sense of dread.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Saint Gu Qingfeng!"</p><p></p><p>"As long as he lives, no one can shake the Gu Family in the slightest!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuankong took a deep breath, his seemingly calm expression betraying a hint of trepidation.</p><p></p><p>Towards this figure,</p><p></p><p>he feels a deep sense of dread from the bottom of his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Guangyang King's ability to reach this point is also largely due to Gu Qingfeng's contributions.</p><p></p><p>In the entire world, only this one person has been revered as a Martial Saint in the past millennia.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuankong does not naively believe that the ancient Li Family can contend with this figure.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Li Xuankong looked at the Li Family elder beside him and coldly said, "Instruct the family members who have come to Guangyang Prefecture to be more discreet. If they offend the Gu Family, I will have to clean house."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, understood!"</p><p></p><p>The Li Family elder quickly nodded upon hearing this. He also sensed the saber intent and understood Li Xuankong's concerns.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the palace.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sat alone in the small courtyard, sipping tea.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not leave the residence, he could still sense the arrival of many powerful figures in the prefecture capital.</p><p></p><p>For this reason,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng intentionally released a trace of saber intent as a deterrent.</p><p></p><p>He believed that anyone with strength above a certain level would be able to glimpse this saber intent and would not dare to make any untoward moves.</p><p></p><p>As for those who cannot even perceive the saber intent, they do not have the qualifications to stir up any trouble.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The eighth of the ninth month.</p><p></p><p>The sacrificial altar has been erected high.</p><p></p><p>The military forces are lined up, their aura piercing the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Please summon the Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>A palace eunuch shouted, and everyone bowed and lowered their heads as Gu Yang, dressed in imperial robes with golden embroidery, wearing a black jade crown, stepped onto the altar. His stern countenance exuded an aura that was difficult for ordinary people to withstand.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang slowly walked up the altar, where nine ancient cauldrons were arranged in a special formation, with incense wafting up as if reaching the nine celestial realms.</p><p></p><p>"I, a commoner, have been blessed by Heaven..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang opened the sacrificial text and spoke in a clear voice that reached everyone's ears. As the words left his mouth, the sky above Guangyang Prefecture seemed to undergo a dramatic transformation, and an indescribable pressure suddenly appeared, causing many of the attendees to change expression.</p><p></p><p>"What is he doing?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Liuyun's expression was tinged with a hint of alarm. The establishment of past dynasties had never witnessed such celestial phenomena. The inexplicable pressure even made Ji Liuyun feel a sense of unease.</p><p></p><p>Yes, uneasy.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was as if something momentous was about to happen.</p><p></p><p>It was not just Ji Liuyun who felt this way. The others also shared a similar sentiment.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the palace,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked up at the sky, and in his vision, he seemed to see vast azure qi gathering. This azure qi existed between reality and illusion, barely perceptible to the naked eye.</p><p></p><p>Above the azure qi,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng seemed to see a pair of indifferent eyes, as if they contained the Dao of the heavens and the earth. When their gazes met, a powerful celestial might pressed down upon him.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The saber intent surged to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, it abruptly shattered.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng felt a slight stinging in his eyes, and he instinctively closed them. After a while, when he reopened them, they were bloodshot, and it took a long time for them to return to normal.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Dao..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured, his expression deeply solemn.</p><p></p><p>In that moment of eye contact, he had a natural realization that those eyes were the Heavenly Dao of this world. This overwhelming celestial might was something that even Gu Qingfeng's cultivation could not fully withstand.</p><p></p><p>But this was to be expected.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Heavenly Dao that governs all beings, how could it be easily shaken by ordinary power?</p><p></p><p>This time,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not attempt to further observe the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at his information panel.</p><p></p><p>The text on it was constantly updating.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' is performing the Heavenly Sacrifice!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' is reciting the Heavenly Sacrifice text, causing the Heavenly Dao to take notice!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang'..."</p><p></p><p>Line after line of text updated, all related to Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>the Heavenly Sacrifice was nearing its conclusion.</p><p></p><p>"The dynasty shall be named the Divine Martial, with the capital established in Guangyang, and the Nine Cauldrons shall stabilize the nation. May the Heavenly Dao bear witness!"</p><p></p><p>As Gu Yang finished reciting the Heavenly Sacrifice text, the sky above the Nine Prefectures suddenly trembled, as if the voice of the Heavenly Dao was resounding endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying azure qi gathered from the four corners of the world, forming a azure lotus that took root in the heavens, as if suppressing the ancient sky.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards,</p><p></p><p>mysterious power descended into the Nine Cauldrons. The nine ancient cauldrons forged by Gu Yang's command began to tremble, and their illusory forms guarded the azure lotus, as the overwhelming celestial might swept across everything.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Not only that.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming blue aura also fell upon Gu Yang at this moment, causing his aura to suddenly surge, as if his cultivation had been replenished by an unparalleled expert, directly breaking through the original bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>Refining Impurity First Realm! Refining Impurity Second Realm! Refining Impurity Third Realm! Refining Impurity Fourth Realm! Refining Impurity Fifth Realm!...</p><p></p><p>In less than ten breaths, Gu Yang instantly stepped into the perfection of the Refining Impurity Fifth Realm.</p><p></p><p>But it did not stop there.</p><p></p><p>After stepping into the perfection of the Refining Impurity Fifth Realm, Gu Yang only paused for a moment before directly breaking through the constraints of the Refining Impurity Fifth Realm and stepping into an even higher realm.</p><p></p><p>Initial Patriarch Realm!</p><p></p><p>Intermediate Patriarch Realm! </p><p></p><p>Advanced Patriarch Realm!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Until he reached the peak of the Patriarch Realm, this breakthrough finally came to a halt.</p><p></p><p>Stepping into the Patriarch Realm.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying aura erupted from Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>The entire world was shocked.</p><p></p><p>All the witnesses were unable to conceal the astonishment and horror on their faces, their gazes towards Gu Yang filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>For the first time.</p><p></p><p>They felt that the situation had slipped out of their control.</p><p></p><p>They had thought it was just a simple celestial ritual, but they never expected such an unexpected turn of events.</p><p></p><p>The azure lotus that was rooted in the void, the nine cauldrons that suppressed the eight realms, and the terrifying aura of Gu Yang reaching the peak of the Patriarch Realm, all of this made the powerful experts of the Ji Family and other immortal sects feel their brows twitch.</p><p></p><p>Clearly.</p><p></p><p>This celestial ritual was completely different from the past.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the other things.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying aura emanating from the nine cauldrons alone made them feel a sense of unresistable illusion.</p><p></p><p>No--</p><p></p><p>It was not an illusion.</p><p></p><p>But the reality was just like that.</p><p></p><p>"The Ji Family's foundation is deep, Brother Ji may be able to see what exactly these changes are about?" Li Xuankong looked at Ji Liuyun with astonishment and asked.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ji Liuyun bitterly smiled and shook his head: "Such changes have never been recorded in the Ji Family, this matter may not be as simple as we thought!"</p><p></p><p>Originally, according to the Ji Family's plan, they could just endure for a while and wait until that Martial Saint passed away, then the insignificant Gu Family would be at their mercy.</p><p></p><p>But now it seems.</p><p></p><p>The situation has completely slipped out of Ji Liuyun's control.</p><p></p><p>Even if Gu Qingfeng passed away, with the terrifying power of the nine cauldrons now, it might be enough to subdue the entire world.</p><p></p><p>The aura emanating from any of the ancient cauldrons made Ji Liuyun feel a sense of shock.</p><p></p><p>If the hidden power of these precious treasures were to be fully unleashed, the Ji Family might be reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Not only that.</p><p></p><p>Under the aura of the nine cauldrons, Ji Liuyun felt an indescribable fear coming from his own body.</p><p></p><p>This fear.</p><p></p><p>Did not originate from himself, but from the evil spirits sealed within his flesh.</p><p></p><p>In other words.</p><p></p><p>The power of the nine cauldrons was enough to make even the evil spirits feel fear.</p><p></p><p>"To slay the evil spirits!" Ji Liuyun's expression became increasingly grim as he thought of this possibility.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng possessed the method to eliminate the evil spirits, this was something Ji Liuyun was well aware of.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why he did not tear off the mask with the Gu Family.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>The ability to slay the evil spirits had always belonged solely to Gu Qingfeng, and once he passed away, the Gu Family would find it difficult for anyone else to reach that level.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>With the appearance of the nine cauldrons.</p><p></p><p>Ji Liuyun realized that even after Gu Qingfeng's passing, the nine cauldrons would still loom over the heads of all the immortal sects and families.</p><p></p><p>If he had known this would be the case beforehand, Ji Liuyun would never have retreated.</p><p></p><p>After all.</p><p></p><p>Such changes might completely alter the pattern of the entire world and even the future.</p><p></p><p>The Ji Family's chance of making a comeback would be extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately.</p><p></p><p>There are no "ifs" in anything.</p><p></p><p>What has happened has happened, and Ji Liuyun had no way to change it.</p><p></p><p>Now, he could only watch everything unfold, powerless to do anything.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The evil spirits have thrown the world into chaos, the sinister and rampant, harming the people of the Nine States, We deeply feel the pain, today We shall use the nine cauldrons to suppress the evil spirits of the Nine States and restore the heavens and earth!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>As soon as his words fell, the nine cauldrons began to tremble, and then eight of the cauldrons transformed into streams of light and disappeared into the eight realms of the world.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>In the skies above the other eight states, ancient cauldrons could be seen pressing down on the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The majestic divine might descended, and on the lands of the Nine States, all the hidden evil spirits and sinister beings, upon seeing the ancient cauldrons in the void, revealed expressions of fear.</p><p></p><p>Some evil spirits that had been dormant for hundreds of years awakened, but before they could take any action, the divine might came crashing down, causing those evil spirits to be instantly reduced to dust.</p><p></p><p>This scene was just a microcosm of what was happening across the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>The nine cauldrons soaring through the sky.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>This terrifying power was like the great sun illuminating the heavens and earth, and whenever the evil spirits and sinister beings came into contact with this power, they were like the filth in the dark corners, completely obliterated under the cleansing light.</p><p></p><p>Only the evil spirits that were hidden within the bodies of the cultivators were able to barely survive.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators across the world also had expressions of terror.</p><p></p><p>They all had a premonition that if they dared to use the power of the evil spirits, causing the evil spirits within them to show signs of revival, once detected by the nine cauldrons, they would be directly slaughtered on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Even.</p><p></p><p>Using the slightest bit of spiritual power related to the evil spirits might also become a target for the nine cauldrons to annihilate.</p><p></p><p>In such a situation, no one dared to take the risk.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the nine cauldrons.</p><p></p><p>Was like a blade hanging over their heads, seemingly ready to fall at any moment and take their lives.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, what is this thing, why has such a thing appeared in the Nine States!!"</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators had expressions of shock, looking at the nine cauldrons in the void with anger, but more with fear.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>There were also cultivators who suppressed the ominous premonition in their hearts, their expressions becoming ferocious and terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"I refuse to believe that a mere ancient cauldron can have such divine might, to the point of exterminating a city before me, I shall be able to break through to the Fusion Spirit Realm, and then the heavens will be vast and who can stop me!"</p><p></p><p>He looked at the city in front of him, where many civilians lived, which he saw as the blood sacrifice for his own breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Immediately.</p><p></p><p>This cultivator began to mobilize his spiritual power, intending to directly slaughter all the civilians in the city.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to use his own power, the ancient cauldron in the sky trembled slightly, and a divine light suddenly erupted from within the cauldron, instantly striking down this cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>The divine light descended.</p><p></p><p>This cultivator, who had already stepped one foot into the Fusion Spirit Realm, did not even have time to struggle before being directly killed on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Even the evil spirit that was carried in his body did not have time to truly revive before being completely obliterated.</p><p></p><p>Scenes like this were occurring throughout the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were many cultivators in the world, and even though Gu Yang's army was suppressing the Nine States, it was difficult to completely eliminate all the rampaging cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators were hiding in the dark, waiting for the opportunity to strike, often wiping out an entire village or city, and then fleeing before the army arrived.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>Under the suppression of the nine cauldrons, all the cultivators were without any place to hide.</p><p></p><p>As long as they dared to use their own power to slaughter the civilians, before they could even succeed, they would be killed on the spot by the nine cauldrons.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>The Nine States were completely cleansed.</p><p></p><p>All of this, though it seemed to be a lengthy process, was actually happening in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's information panel was now frantically updating.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has performed the celestial ritual, established the Divine Martial Kingdom, ruled over the Nine States, and achieved the accomplishment of 'Reigning over the World'! (Can only be triggered once)"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +3000 Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 10 Grandmaster Ascension Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 10 Level 9 Profound Insight Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: Primordial Immortal Body!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has broken through to the Refining Impurity First Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +200 Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 100 Refining Impurity Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 10 Golden Body Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has broken through to the Refining Impurity Second Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +200 Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 100 Refining Impurity Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 10 Golden Body Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has broken through to the Refining Impurity Third Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +200 Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 100 Refining Impurity Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 10 Golden Body Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has broken through to the Initial Patriarch Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +300 Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 100 Golden Body Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 10 Profound Insight Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has broken through to the Intermediate Patriarch Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +300 Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 100 Golden Body Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 10 Profound Insight Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has broken through to the Advanced Patriarch Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +300 Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 100 Golden Body Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 10 Profound Insight Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has broken through to the Patriarch Realm Perfection!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +300 Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 100 Golden Body Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 10 Profound Insight Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has used the nine cauldrons to suppress the Nine States, cleansing the world of evil spirits, shaking the four corners!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang'..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A large amount of information was constantly updating, leaving Gu Qingfeng somewhat dazzled, and at the same time, the smile on his face was completely unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>Even before Gu Yang established the kingdom, Gu Qingfeng had already thought that once Gu Yang founded the dynasty, he would definitely be able to obtain tremendous benefits.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng never imagined.</p><p></p><p>That the so-called benefits would be so astonishing.</p><p></p><p>A huge amount of rewards.</p><p></p><p>Even Gu Qingfeng found it hard to keep up.</p><p></p><p>Leaving aside the other elixirs, just in terms of the Cultivation Points alone, Gu Qingfeng had abruptly increased by a full 5,200 points.</p><p></p><p>3,000 points from the achievement.</p><p>1,000 points from the Refining Impurity Realms.</p><p>1,200 points from the Patriarch Realms.</p><p></p><p>The rewards given by this information panel were far more than Gu Qingfeng had accumulated over the past decades.</p><p></p><p>"This time, it can truly be considered a windfall!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng could barely suppress the trembling in his heart. If all these Cultivation Points were to be fully converted into his own strength, he did not dare to imagine how terrifying his cultivation would become.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the Cultivation Points, the so-called Primordial Immortal Body was what Gu Qingfeng was most concerned about.

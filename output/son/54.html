        <h1>Chapter 54</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The matter of Elder Xue Wang's demise, our Qingyang Sect has not settled the account with your Gu family yet. Now that you, Gu Qingfeng, have brought people over, could it be that you are eager to seek death?"</p><p></p><p>Qu Zhan looked at the group of Gu family warriors, and his gaze finally landed on Gu Qingfeng, his expression cold and indifferent.</p><p></p><p>Qu Zhan was also aware of the news of Xue Wang's death.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, Qu Zhan did not take Gu Qingfeng seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>As fellow elders of the same sect, Xue Wang was merely a Copper Bone Perfected, a mid-level Refining Bone cultivator who had cultivated a bit of Silver Bone.</p><p></p><p>But Qu Zhan was different.</p><p></p><p>Ten years ago, he had already reached the pinnacle of Silver Bone, and now he had even cultivated a portion of Golden Bone, just one step away from breaking through to the peak realm of Refining Bone.</p><p></p><p>With such strength, he was one of the top three powerhouses in the entire Qingyang Sect.</p><p></p><p>Killing Xue Wang, Qu Zhan could have done it himself.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this was the territory of the Qingyang Sect, Qu Zhan's own domain, and he had no reason to fear.</p><p></p><p>"When Xue Wang passed away, I, Gu, had promised him that I would send the people of the Qingyang Sect to accompany him, so that he would not be too lonely on his journey to the Underworld."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stood with his hands behind his back, his expression devoid of sorrow or joy.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, Qu Zhan burst into mocking laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Presumptuous!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Qu Zhan waved his hand and issued an order to the Qingyang Sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>"Kill, not a single person from the Gu family is to be spared today!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Qu Zhan took the initiative and struck first.</p><p></p><p>His figure darted out like a giant bird, his hands emanating a daunting blue glow as he lunged towards Gu Qingfeng's face, his nails leaving white trails in the air as they slashed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's figure remained unmoved, and his protective Qi aura appeared. Qu Zhan's full-force strike landed on the Qi aura, only causing it to tremble slightly, without a hint of it being shattered.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, the powerful recoil force caused Qu Zhan's ten fingers to explode in a shower of flesh and blood, which flowed down from the wounds.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible..."</p><p></p><p>Qu Zhan's expression was one of horror, the excruciating pain in his ten fingers making him disbelieving.</p><p></p><p>After all, his current strength was only a step away from the pinnacle of Golden Bone, and he was considered a powerful expert even in the entire Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Yet, his enraged strike could not even break through Gu Qingfeng's protective Qi aura, how could Qu Zhan not be shocked?</p><p></p><p>However, before Qu Zhan could be shocked for too long, Gu Qingfeng raised his hand and struck out with a punch. The seemingly slow motion was actually as swift as lightning, and by the time Qu Zhan reacted, the fist was already upon him.</p><p></p><p>Unable to dodge in time, Qu Zhan could only activate his physical Qi and blood to form a Qi aura for protection.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The Qi aura appeared, but in the next instant, it shattered like bubbles, and the mighty, domineering punch landed squarely on Qu Zhan's chest, directly punching a hole through his body. His heart was instantly reduced to powder under the overwhelming force.</p><p></p><p>By the time Gu Qingfeng withdrew his bloodied fist, Qu Zhan had already fallen, his face filled with resentment.</p><p></p><p>The mighty Refining Bone Realm expert could not even withstand Gu Qingfeng's single punch.</p><p></p><p>This scene left the other Qingyang Sect disciples greatly shocked and horrified.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" Gu Qingfeng issued the order, and he stepped over Qu Zhan's corpse, charging towards the Qingyang Sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Gu family warriors also quickly joined the fray.</p><p></p><p>With Qu Zhan's death, the remaining Qingyang Sect disciples, although some were not weak experts, were still no match for Gu Qingfeng, who could easily kill them with a single punch.</p><p></p><p>Every punch Gu Qingfeng threw out...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It represented the fall of a disciple of the Qingyang Sect.</p><p></p><p>In just a brief moment,</p><p></p><p>Dozens of cultivators at the Blood Refining Realm had perished at the hands of Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Nanqiu arrived and witnessed this scene, his eyes bulged with rage. Without waiting for the Qingyang Patriarch to speak, he immediately drew his sword and charged at Gu Qingfeng, filled with fury.</p><p></p><p>"Die for me!"</p><p></p><p>The sharp sword sliced through the air.</p><p>The sword qi was chilling.</p><p></p><p>As a Bone Refining Realm expert exerting his full strength, the momentum was truly colossal, with surging sword qi like a raging torrent, causing many of Gu's disciples to change expression.</p><p></p><p>Only Gu Qingfeng remained calm and collected. With a single punch, he shattered the head of a Qingyang Sect disciple, then swiftly struck out with another fist, colliding with the incoming long sword.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Fist and sword clashed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nanqiu's sword strike, which was imbued with all his strength, failed to slay Gu Qingfeng as he had expected. It couldn't even breach his defenses, only leaving a white mark on his fist.</p><p></p><p>This sight caused Ye Nanqiu's pupils to suddenly constrict.</p><p></p><p>"You are not just at the Bone Refining Realm—"</p><p>"You are the Patriarch of the Qingyang Sect!"</p><p></p><p>A sinister smile appeared on Gu Qingfeng's face. His left hand grabbed the sword blade and yanked it back forcefully, then stepped forward with his right hand striking out, the scorching energy seemingly able to distort the air.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the threat, Ye Nanqiu didn't hesitate to release his grip on the long sword and swiftly retreat.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately,</p><p>His movements were fast, but Gu Qingfeng's were even faster.</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Qingfeng's strike was about to land, Ye Nanqiu, no longer caring about face, cried out in terror, "Patriarch, save me!!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell,</p><p>The Qingyang Patriarch also suddenly moved.</p><p></p><p>But just as the Qingyang Patriarch was about to act, Gu Qingfeng's palm had already firmly struck Ye Nanqiu's chest, the powerful palm force breaking through his protective spiritual energy and shattering his internal organs.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p>The Qingyang Patriarch's attack arrived.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had no time to defend, and could only activate his protective spiritual energy to withstand it. However, the spiritual energy that could not be broken by Bone Refining Realm experts was completely ineffective against the Qingyang Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the spiritual energy shattered.</p><p>The lingering force struck Gu Qingfeng's body, causing his clothes on the back to explode, and his body to stagger forward involuntarily, his blood and qi surging uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng quickly suppressed the turbulent blood and qi, turned around, and struck out with a palm, colliding directly with the Qingyang Patriarch's hand.</p><p></p><p>The two palms met.</p><p>Terrifying power erupted.</p><p></p><p>In the next instant,</p><p>Both parties took a few steps back.</p><p></p><p>"So you are the Qingyang Patriarch?"</p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes were ice-cold as he looked at the elder, while secretly mobilizing his blood and qi power to expel the cold aura that had invaded his body.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p>The Qingyang Patriarch's expression also turned gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"You are Gu Qingfeng. I didn't expect you to have already reached the Marrow Cleansing Realm. It seems everyone has underestimated you!"</p><p></p><p>From that previous exchange, the Qingyang Patriarch had already determined that Gu Qingfeng was no longer just at the Bone Refining Realm, but had already entered the Marrow Cleansing Realm.</p><p></p><p>What surprised the Qingyang Patriarch even more was that Ye Nanqiu, the Sect Master, was unable to withstand a single strike and was slain on the spot.</p><p></p><p>At this time,</p><p>The Qingyang Patriarch spoke again.</p><p></p><p>"But you shouldn't have set foot in the Qingyang Sect. Even if you are at the Marrow Cleansing Realm, dying at my hands as a Marrow Cleansing Realm cultivator is no simple matter."</p><p></p><p>"With your age and talent, if you didn't die, you might have even had the chance to reach the Patriarch Realm one day."</p><p></p><p>"But alas, you are destined to die here today—"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ten boxes of gold.</p><p></p><p>Each box of gold is around two thousand taels.</p><p></p><p>Ten boxes of gold.</p><p></p><p>That's a total of twenty thousand taels.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore,</p><p></p><p>there are three boxes of martial arts manuals.</p><p></p><p>The Shen Quan Sect has a lineage of thousands of years, and has produced two eminent sect masters, which can be considered a top-tier major sect.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>the Shen Quan Sect is naturally not lacking in martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The three boxes of martial arts manuals combined contain hundreds of volumes.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>after Gu Qingfeng took a cursory look, he found that most of these martial arts involve refining skin and blood, and once it reaches the level of refining bones and beyond, the number of martial arts drastically decreases.</p><p></p><p>It can be seen that,</p><p></p><p>even with the foundation of the Shen Quan Sect, high-grade martial arts are not abundant.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>even though high-grade martial arts are not abundant, there are still twenty-six of them.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Qingfeng had not yet broken through to the level of Perfect Bone Refinement, then these twenty-six high-grade martial arts would be extremely important.</p><p></p><p>But now -</p><p></p><p>High-grade martial arts have little use for him.</p><p></p><p>Perfect Bone Refinement!</p><p></p><p>The reason it has the word "perfect" is to indicate that this level cannot be further improved.</p><p></p><p>Even if Gu Qingfeng were to cultivate hundreds or thousands of high-grade martial arts in the future, they would not bring him any further enhancement.</p><p></p><p>This is the difference between Perfect Bone Refinement and ordinary Bone Refinement.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>in addition to the high-grade martial arts, there are also a few supreme martial arts and transcendent martial arts involving the refinement of organs.</p><p></p><p>Among them,</p><p></p><p>there are six supreme martial arts and three transcendent martial arts.</p><p></p><p>As well as -</p><p></p><p>One Patriarch-level martial art.</p><p></p><p>"The Prajna Sutra!"</p><p></p><p>"This is a martial art that directly points to the Patriarch-level!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's brows raised slightly.</p><p></p><p>This is the first true Patriarch-level martial art he has obtained.</p><p></p><p>Although the Scarlet Flame Divine Skill can also allow one to break through to the Patriarch-level, in terms of grade, it is naturally not as good as the Prajna Sutra in front of him.</p><p></p><p>This is because the Prajna Sutra not only can allow one to break through to the Xiantian (Transcendent) realm, but it also directly points to the peak of the Xiantian realm.</p><p></p><p>This martial art is divided into thirteen layers.</p><p></p><p>The first nine layers are cultivation methods for cultivators below the Patriarch-level.</p><p></p><p>The last four layers involve the complete Xiantian realm.</p><p></p><p>From the initial entry into the Xiantian realm to the peak of the Xiantian realm, the Prajna Sutra has complete records.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that,</p><p></p><p>just based on this,</p><p></p><p>the Prajna Sutra is much more precious than the Scarlet Flame Divine Skill.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>everything has two sides.</p><p></p><p>Although the Prajna Sutra has a higher upper limit, the difficulty in breaking through to the Patriarch-level is undoubtedly simpler with the Scarlet Flame Divine Skill.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Prajna Sutra (Not Learned Yet)! ...</p><p></p><p>This martial art has been completely recorded in his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng's gaze signaled the others to withdraw, then he took out a black iron box from his bosom, which seemed to be airtight, with only a small hole on top, seemingly for inserting a key.</p><p></p><p>"This is something that I found on the highest level of the Shen Quan Sect's scripture repository. That level has no surplus martial arts, only this box.</p><p></p><p>I feel that this box is extraordinary, but unfortunately I couldn't find the key, so I've brought it for the Patriarch to take a look!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Qingfeng's expression remained unchanged as he took the box and examined it carefully. Then, with two fingers, he exerted force, but found that the box did not budge at all.</p><p></p><p>Such a degree of toughness is enough to indicate the extraordinary nature of the black box. After all, Gu Qingfeng's cultivation has reached a transcendent and saintly level, and even the strength of his two fingers is heavier than a thousand tons, able to crush stone into powder with ease.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was just ordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression became much more serious, and then he mobilized the power of his qi and blood. His five fingers suddenly exerted force, and the black box suddenly caved in.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after.</p><p></p><p>He used both hands to pry it apart.</p><p></p><p>The box was instantly broken into two pieces.</p><p></p><p>With the box broken, the item inside also appeared in the two people's line of sight.</p><p></p><p>A piece of gold cloth embroidered with gold thread, with dense text written on it.</p><p></p><p>After a long time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng withdrew his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"The Sutra of the Floating Stupa of Hell!"</p><p></p><p>This was the name of the secret technique recorded on the gold cloth.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking.</p><p></p><p>This was a secret technique for refining evil into the body.</p><p></p><p>The difference was.</p><p></p><p>This secret technique directly pointed to the Fusion Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>In other words.</p><p></p><p>If there were later practitioners who could bear the evil spirits after the death of the Shenmu Dao, and then cultivate this Sutra of the Floating Stupa of Hell, they might have the hope of breaking through the limit of the Spirit Controlling realm and stepping into the Fusion Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>The Fusion Spirit realm! It was a higher realm than the Spirit Controlling realm.</p><p></p><p>"The peak Spirit Controlling realm cultivators have already reached the level of being able to stand shoulder to shoulder with ordinary Grandmasters. If they step into the Fusion Spirit realm, their strength would be at least at the level of True Meaning Grandmasters, or even comparable to Great Grandmasters."</p><p></p><p>"Shenmu Dao did not reach this level, otherwise the outcome of this battle would have been uncertain."</p><p></p><p>"Like the Tianyang Sword Sect, it seems that there are Fusion Spirit realm cultivators, but as for whether there are existences above the Fusion Spirit realm, that is unknown."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered.</p><p></p><p>Then he put away the Sutra of the Floating Stupa of Hell.</p><p></p><p>The secret technique for refining evil into the body.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng naturally would not let it spread.</p><p></p><p>But from this, it can be seen that the purpose of Duan Ping's arrival here was probably to go after the Sutra of the Floating Stupa of Hell and the evil spirits on Shenmu Dao's body.</p><p></p><p>An evil spirit that could allow someone to have the opportunity to advance to the Fusion Spirit realm, as well as the corresponding secret technique, the preciousness of which need not be said.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Tianyang Sword Sect had Fusion Spirit realm cultivators, Gu Qingfeng believed that there would not be too many of this level of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>As for Duan Ping.</p><p></p><p>The other party had not refined evil into the body.</p><p></p><p>It might be that the time was not right, or it might be that he was waiting for a special opportunity.</p><p></p><p>But no matter what the reason was, these were no longer important.</p><p></p><p>Duan Ping's death.</p><p></p><p>Everything had dissipated like smoke and clouds.</p><p></p><p>"Continue searching, the Shenquan Sect produced a True Meaning Grandmaster thousands of years ago, so the Shenquan Sect most likely has the remnants of a Grandmaster's true essence, or involves martial arts at the Grandmaster level.</p><p></p><p>A single Prajnaparamita Sutra is by no means the entirety of the Shenquan Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at Gu Peng and said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The Shenquan Sect was renowned in the jianghu for its fist techniques, and it had even produced a True Meaning Grandmaster thousands of years ago, which meant that the Shenquan Sect must have a certain fist technique or martial art.</p><p></p><p>Moreover.</p><p></p><p>It might involve the existence of a Grandmaster's true essence.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Grandmaster's true essence diagram that the Gu family manor had previously obtained.</p><p></p><p>Such things.</p><p></p><p>In terms of preciousness, they are actually no less than the Prajnaparamita Sutra.</p><p></p><p>"I will go and take care of it immediately!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng immediately accepted the order and withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng continued to ponder the profundity of the Prajnaparamita Sutra.</p><p></p><p>The Thirteen Layers of the Prajnaparamita Sutra.</p><p></p><p>If he could comprehend them, it could further advance his strength.</p><p></p><p>Moreover.</p><p></p><p>As the supreme innate art, each step of the foundation building in the Prajnaparamita Sutra, even if it has not reached perfection, should be extremely close to it.</p><p></p><p>In this way.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's subsequent perfect marrow cleansing and perfect refinement of the dantian would also become much easier.</p><p></p><p>Observing the supreme art.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's entire qi and blood would self-regulate, and the difficulty of cultivating the corresponding level of martial arts with his perfect physical body would suddenly decrease significantly.</p><p></p><p>In just a short moment, Gu Qingfeng had successfully entered the first layer of the Prajnaparamita Sutra.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

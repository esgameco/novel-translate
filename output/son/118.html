        <h1>Chapter 118</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ten boxes of gold.</p><p></p><p>Each box of gold is roughly around two thousand taels.</p><p></p><p>Ten boxes of gold.</p><p></p><p>That would be twenty thousand taels.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore,</p><p></p><p>there are three boxes of martial arts manuals.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Fist Sect has been passed down for thousands of years, and has produced two eminent sect masters, which can be considered a top-tier major sect.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>in terms of martial arts, the Divine Fist Sect is naturally not lacking in any way.</p><p></p><p>The three boxes of martial arts combined contain a total of several hundred volumes.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>when Gu Qingfeng briefly glanced through them, he found that most of these martial arts involve refining skin and refining blood, but once it comes to refining bones and above, the number of martial arts drastically decreases.</p><p></p><p>It can be seen that,</p><p></p><p>even with the foundation of the Divine Fist Sect, high-grade martial arts are not abundant.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>even though high-grade martial arts are not abundant, there are still a full twenty-six of them.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Qingfeng had not yet broken through to the Perfect Bone Refinement stage, then these twenty-six high-grade martial arts would be extremely important to him.</p><p></p><p>But now -</p><p></p><p>High-grade martial arts no longer have much use for him.</p><p></p><p>Perfect Bone Refinement!</p><p></p><p>The reason why the word "perfect" is used,</p><p></p><p>is to indicate that this stage cannot be further improved upon.</p><p></p><p>Even if Gu Qingfeng were to cultivate hundreds or thousands of high-grade martial arts in the future, they would not bring him any additional enhancement.</p><p></p><p>This,</p><p></p><p>is the difference between Perfect Bone Refinement and ordinary Bone Refinement.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>in addition to the high-grade martial arts, there are also a few supreme-grade martial arts and transcendent martial arts involving the refinement of organs.</p><p></p><p>Among them,</p><p></p><p>there are six supreme-grade martial arts,</p><p></p><p>three transcendent martial arts,</p><p></p><p>and -</p><p></p><p>one Patriarch-level martial art.</p><p></p><p>"The Prajna Sutra!"</p><p></p><p>"This is a martial art that directly points to the Patriarch-level!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's brow slightly raised.</p><p></p><p>This is the first true Patriarch-level martial art he has obtained.</p><p></p><p>Although the Crimson Flame Divine Skill can also allow one to break through to the Patriarch-level, in terms of grade, it is naturally not as good as the Prajna Sutra in front of him.</p><p></p><p>This is because the Prajna Sutra not only can allow one to break through to the Xiantian (Transcendent) realm, but it also directly points to the peak of the Xiantian realm.</p><p></p><p>This martial art is divided into thirteen levels.</p><p></p><p>The first nine levels are cultivation methods for those below the Patriarch-level.</p><p></p><p>The last four levels involve the complete Xiantian realm.</p><p></p><p>From the initial entry into the Xiantian realm to the peak of the Xiantian realm, the Prajna Sutra has comprehensive records.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that,</p><p></p><p>just based on this,</p><p></p><p>the Prajna Sutra is much more precious than the Crimson Flame Divine Skill.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>everything has two sides.</p><p></p><p>Although the Prajna Sutra has a higher upper limit, the difficulty in breaking through to the Patriarch-level is undoubtedly simpler with the Crimson Flame Divine Skill.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Prajna Sutra (Not yet Learned)!...</p><p></p><p>This martial art has already been completely recorded in his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng's gaze signaled the others to withdraw, then he took out a black iron box from his bosom, which seemed to be airtight, with only a small hole on top, seemingly for inserting a key.</p><p></p><p>"This is something that I found on the highest level of the Divine Fist Sect's library, where there were no extra martial arts, only this box. </p><p></p><p>I feel that this box is extraordinary, but unfortunately I couldn't find the key, so I've brought it for the Patriarch to take a look!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Qingfeng's expression remained unchanged as he took the box and examined it carefully for a moment, then used two fingers to forcefully pinch it, but found that the box did not budge at all.</p><p></p><p>Such a degree of toughness is enough to show the extraordinary nature of the black box. After all, Gu Qingfeng's cultivation has reached a transcendent and saintly level, and even the strength of his two fingers is heavier than a thousand catties, able to crush stone into powder with ease.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was just a casual matter.</p><p></p><p>"How interesting!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression became much more serious, and then he mobilized the power of his blood energy. His five fingers suddenly exerted great force, and the black box suddenly caved in.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after.</p><p></p><p>He used both hands to pry it open.</p><p></p><p>The box was instantly broken into two pieces.</p><p></p><p>With the box shattered, the item inside also appeared in the vision of the two people.</p><p></p><p>A piece of cloth embroidered with gold thread, on which were densely written words.</p><p></p><p>After a long time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng withdrew his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"The Sutra of the Floating Stupa of Hell!"</p><p></p><p>This was the name of the secret technique recorded on the golden cloth.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking.</p><p></p><p>This was a secret technique that cultivates evil into the body.</p><p></p><p>The difference was.</p><p></p><p>This secret technique directly pointed to the Fusion Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>In other words.</p><p></p><p>If there were later practitioners who could bear the evil aura left behind by the death of the Shenmu Dao, and then cultivate this Sutra of the Floating Stupa of Hell, they might have the hope of breaking through the limit of the Spirit Controlling realm and stepping into the Fusion Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>The Fusion Spirit realm! It was a higher realm than the Spirit Controlling realm.</p><p></p><p>"The peak-level practitioners of the Spirit Controlling realm have already reached the level of ordinary masters. If they step into the Fusion Spirit realm, their strength would at least be at the level of True Meaning Masters, or even comparable to Great Masters."</p><p></p><p>"Shenmu Dao did not reach this level, otherwise the outcome of this battle would have been uncertain."</p><p></p><p>"Like the Tianyang Sword Sect, it seems that there are Fusion Spirit realm practitioners there, but as for whether there are existences above the Fusion Spirit realm, that is unknown."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered.</p><p></p><p>Then he put away the Sutra of the Floating Stupa of Hell.</p><p></p><p>The secret technique of cultivating evil into the body.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng naturally would not let it spread.</p><p></p><p>However, from this, it can be seen that the purpose of Duan Ping's arrival here was probably to go after the Sutra of the Floating Stupa of Hell and the evil aura on Shenmu Dao's body.</p><p></p><p>An evil aura that could allow someone to have the opportunity to advance to the Fusion Spirit realm, as well as the corresponding secret technique, the preciousness of which need not be said.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Tianyang Sword Sect had Fusion Spirit realm practitioners, Gu Qingfeng believed that there would not be too many at this level.</p><p></p><p>As for Duan Ping.</p><p></p><p>The other party had not cultivated the evil aura.</p><p></p><p>It might be that the time was not right, or it might be that he was waiting for a special opportunity.</p><p></p><p>But no matter what the reason was, these were no longer important.</p><p></p><p>Duan Ping's death.</p><p></p><p>Everything had dissipated like smoke and clouds.</p><p></p><p>"Continue searching, the神拳宗 (Shen Quan Sect) produced a True Meaning Master thousands of years ago, so the Shen Quan Sect most likely has the remnants of a master's true essence, or involves martial arts at the master level.</p><p></p><p>A single Prajnaparamita Sutra is by no means the entirety of the Shen Quan Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at Gu Peng and said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The Shen Quan Sect was famous in the jianghu for its fist techniques, and thousands of years ago it even produced a True Meaning Master, which meant that the Shen Quan Sect must have a certain fist technique or martial art.</p><p></p><p>Moreover.</p><p></p><p>It might involve the true essence of a master.</p><p></p><p>Just like the master's true essence diagram that the Gu family manor originally obtained.</p><p></p><p>Such things.</p><p></p><p>In terms of preciousness, they are not inferior to the Prajnaparamita Sutra.</p><p></p><p>"I will go and take care of it immediately!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Peng immediately accepted the order and withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng continued to ponder the profundity of the Prajnaparamita Sutra.</p><p></p><p>The Thirteen Layers of the Prajnaparamita Sutra.</p><p></p><p>If he could comprehend them, his strength could advance further.</p><p></p><p>Moreover.</p><p></p><p>As the pinnacle of the innate supreme art, each step of the foundation building, even if not perfected, should be extremely close to it.</p><p></p><p>In this way.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's subsequent perfect marrow cleansing and perfect organ refinement would also become much easier.</p><p></p><p>Observing the supreme art.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's entire blood energy was self-adjusting, and the difficulty of cultivating the corresponding level of martial arts with his perfect physical body was suddenly greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>In less than a moment, Gu Qingfeng had successfully entered the first layer of the Prajnaparamita Sutra.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

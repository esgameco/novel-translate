        <h1>Chapter 135</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The two Fusion Realm cultivators had fallen one after the other, causing the evil spirits within them to awaken. In an instant, the Divine Martial Army was thrown into great chaos.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary people, the evil spirits were an existence that could not be resisted.</p><p></p><p>These beings were almost immortal and indestructible.</p><p></p><p>So, the moment the evil spirits awoke, they directly charged into the Divine Martial Army, ruthlessly slaughtering the soldiers and devouring their flesh and blood, instilling a sense of inexplicable dread in the others.</p><p></p><p>This scene left Pei Jing's expression unsightly, and he was also slightly pale.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that Gu Qingfeng's strength had exceeded Pei Jing's expectations.</p><p></p><p>The fall of the three great elders of the Taiyang Sword Sect and the resurgence of the two evil spirits made Pei Jing realize that his own situation was now dire.</p><p></p><p>In this battle, he had no chance of winning.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Qingfeng charging towards him, Pei Jing immediately ordered a retreat while also having his men block Gu Qingfeng's path to create an opportunity for himself to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Divine Martial King has arrived, why leave in such a hurry!" Gu Qingfeng laughed loudly, then let out a long howl as his flesh and blood erupted with terrifying power, sweeping across the battlefield like a blazing furnace. The horrifying aura emanating from him caused the other Divine Martial Army soldiers to be struck with terror, not daring to take a single step forward.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!" Gu Qingfeng's body shook, and he suddenly shot up into the air, then came crashing down with the force of a mountain. In an instant, the earth trembled, and the ground cracked. Within a ten-meter radius, all the soldiers were unable to stand firm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng paid no heed to this. He took a step, covering dozens of meters in the blink of an eye, and appeared before Pei Jing.</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing felt the earth shaking, and his startled horse reared up, but Pei Jing firmly gripped the reins, calming the horse down.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Qingfeng..." Pei Jing's expression surprisingly became calm.</p><p></p><p>"If Brother Gu is willing to join forces with me, we can together conquer the world and rule it side by side!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, Pei Jing realized that he had fallen into a hopeless situation. In this battle, not only had the entire hundred thousand Divine Martial Army been wiped out, but he himself might also be unable to escape.</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing was determined to seize the last opportunity to try and negotiate, as he had spent over twenty years building up his power, and he was unwilling to die here.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head and laughed. "You couldn't even subdue a White Stone Dao, yet you want to contend for the world? Victory or defeat is nothing to be said about. If this is your last words, then I shall remember them!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Gu Qingfeng unleashed a powerful slash. The blood-colored aura of the Tyrant Blade cut through the air, and the threat of death loomed. Pei Jing roared, unleashing his true qi and blood energy in a desperate counterattack.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!" The two forces collided, with Gu Qingfeng's attack overwhelming Pei Jing like a relentless torrent.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Destruction.</p><p></p><p>The bloody sword qi broke through the protective spiritual energy, slashing across Pei Jing's body and killing all the dozens of riders following him on the spot.</p><p></p><p>On the ground,</p><p></p><p>The sword qi formed a ravine.</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing sat firmly on his horse, his body standing upright.</p><p></p><p>After a moment,</p><p></p><p>A line of blood spread down from the opponent's brow. In less than a moment, this mighty Warrior King was split in two and completely fell on the spot.</p><p></p><p>This scene</p><p></p><p>Caused the remaining Warrior King's generals to be utterly terrified.</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing is dead!! This was something no one had anticipated.</p><p></p><p>Before coming to the White Stone Path, everyone thought this battle would be an easy victory, after all, they had not only a hundred thousand elite troops, but also three powerful experts from the Tian Yang Sword Sect accompanying the army.</p><p></p><p>With such a force, not only the small White Stone Path, even the entire Guangyang Prefecture would have few who could truly contend with them.</p><p></p><p>The imperial army of Guangyang Prefecture originally only had a mere three hundred thousand, with fewer Grandmasters and Fusion Realm experts than the Warrior King's army.</p><p></p><p>Who could have imagined</p><p></p><p>That the strength of the White Stone Path would be so formidable.</p><p></p><p>No--</p><p></p><p>To be precise, it was the power of this Overlord Saber that was so terrifying.</p><p></p><p>A Great Grandmaster! This was a true Great Grandmaster! Three strikes killed the three Fusion Realm Elders of the Tian Yang Sword Sect, one strike killed the Xian Tian Grandmaster Warrior King Pei Jing, such strength is truly dreadful.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>The North Gate was closed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang saw this scene and immediately ordered the city gates to be opened, personally leading the army to charge forward. In less than a moment, he had reached in front of Gu Qingfeng, lifting Pei Jing's corpse and shouting angrily:</p><p></p><p>"Warrior King Pei Jing is dead, those who surrender will not be killed!"</p><p></p><p>"Warrior King Pei Jing is dead, those who surrender will not be killed!"</p><p></p><p>"Warrior King Pei Jing is dead, those who surrender will not be killed!"</p><p></p><p>The three loud shouts echoed through the entire army.</p><p></p><p>In an instant,</p><p></p><p>The remaining Warrior King's army, upon seeing Pei Jing's corpse, all revealed expressions of despair and involuntarily dropped their weapons, abandoning resistance.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>As the Warrior King's army laid down their resistance, the two revived evil spirits were still rampaging and causing much turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng immediately acted, suppressing the two evil spirits. Gu Yang then ordered people to bring a golden coffin, completely sealing the two suppressed evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>At this point,</p><p></p><p>The battle was truly over.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>Inside the North Gate.</p><p></p><p>In the temporary government office.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's robe was stained with blood, and he had not yet had time to change, but an undisguised smile was on his face.</p><p></p><p>When he saw Gu Qingfeng, he immediately bowed down.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Father!"</p><p></p><p>"You need not be so formal with me, just say what you have to say."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng glanced at him indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang then straightened up, his face full of smiles: "In this battle, Warrior King Pei Jing has fallen, and nearly half of the hundred thousand Warrior King's army have surrendered. Our Gu family's army has achieved a great victory.</p><p></p><p>Father, what do you think we should do next?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you already have a plan in mind?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng asked in return.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang did not hesitate, directly nodding and saying: "I think that now the Guangyang Prefecture's imperial army has just been defeated, and we have won a great victory, we should seize the opportunity to conquer the entire Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>With Father's strength as a Great Grandmaster, I believe no one in Guangyang Prefecture can withstand you.</p><p></p><p>As for those sects in the jianghu, they are all opportunists, and with Father here, I don't think they dare to stir up too much trouble!"</p><p></p><p>Riding the momentum of this great victory,</p><p></p><p>Swallowing up Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>This is Gu Yang's goal for the next step.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 135</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The two cultivators at the Fusion Shen Boundary level had fallen one after the other, causing the evil spirits within them to revive. In an instant, the Divine Martial Army fell into great chaos.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary people, evil spirits were an existence that could not be resisted.</p><p></p><p>Such existences were almost immortal.</p><p></p><p>So, when the evil spirits revived, they directly charged into the Divine Martial Army, ruthlessly slaughtering the soldiers and devouring their flesh and blood, causing the rest to shiver in fear.</p><p></p><p>This scene made Pei Jing's expression uncomfortable, and he was also slightly pale.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that Gu Qingfeng's strength exceeded his estimation.</p><p></p><p>The fall of the three great elders of the Taiyang Sword Sect and the revival of the two evil spirits made Pei Jing realize that he was now in a dire situation.</p><p></p><p>In this battle, he had no chance of winning.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Qingfeng charging towards him, Pei Jing immediately ordered a retreat while also having his men block Gu Qingfeng's path to create an opportunity for himself to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Divine Martial King has come, why leave in such a hurry!" Gu Qingfeng laughed loudly, then let out a long howl, and his physical aura and blood suddenly exploded, sweeping across the battlefield like a blazing furnace. The terrifying might emanating from him made the other Divine Martial Army members dare not take a single step forward.</p><p></p><p>With a rumbling sound, Gu Qingfeng's body shook, and he suddenly shot up into the air, then came crashing down with the force of a mountain.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the earth trembled, and the ground cracked. Within a ten-zhang radius, all the soldiers were unable to stand firm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng paid no heed to this. He took a step, crossing dozens of zhang in a single breath, and appeared before Pei Jing.</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing felt the earth shaking, and his startled horse reared up, but he firmly gripped the reins, calming the horse down.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Qingfeng..." Pei Jing looked at the man before him, his expression surprisingly calm.</p><p></p><p>"If Brother Gu is willing to join hands with me, we can together conquer the world and rule it!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, Pei Jing realized that he had fallen into a desperate situation. In this battle, not only had the entire hundred thousand Divine Martial Army perished, but he himself might also be unable to escape.</p><p></p><p>Reaching this point, Pei Jing had to try his best to seize the last opportunity. After all, he had spent over twenty years building up his power, and he was unwilling to die here.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Pei Jing also regretted that if he had been more cautious and not led the entire army to the front lines, the situation would not have become so dire. The loss of a hundred thousand troops was not a significant blow to his foundation of hundreds of millions of soldiers. And with such a vast army, he would not have feared a single great master.</p><p></p><p>But now, it was too late. Gu Qingfeng stood before him, and despite Pei Jing being a Xiantian Sect Master himself, he no longer had the courage to fight. The gap between them was too great, to the point of despair.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Pei Jing's words, Gu Qingfeng shook his head and laughed.</p><p></p><p>"You couldn't even subdue a White Stone Dao, yet you want to contend for the world? Victory and defeat are self-evident. If this is your last words, then Gu shall remember them!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Gu Qingfeng unleashed a slash.</p><p></p><p>The tyrannical blade cut through the air, and the blood-colored aura of the Demon-Slaying Blade reflected everything. The threat of death surged in Pei Jing's heart, and he roared, unleashing his true qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>The two forces collided, and Gu Qingfeng's attack swept through like an unstoppable force.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Destruction.</p><p></p><p>The bloody sword qi broke through the protective spiritual energy, slashing across Pei Jing's body and killing all the dozens of riders following him on the spot.</p><p></p><p>On the ground,</p><p></p><p>The sword qi formed a ravine.</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing sat upright on his horse, his body standing still.</p><p></p><p>After a moment,</p><p></p><p>A line of blood started to spread down from the opponent's brow. In less than a moment, this mighty Warrior King was split in two and completely fell on the spot.</p><p></p><p>This scene,</p><p></p><p>Caused the remaining Warrior Army's generals to be utterly terrified.</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing is dead!! This was something no one had anticipated.</p><p></p><p>Before coming to the White Stone Path, everyone thought this battle would be an easy victory, after all, they not only had a hundred thousand elite troops, but also three powerful experts from the Tian Yang Sword Sect accompanying the army.</p><p></p><p>With such a force, not only the small White Stone Path, even the entire Guangyang Prefecture would have very few who could truly contend with them.</p><p></p><p>The imperial army of Guangyang Prefecture originally only had a mere three hundred thousand troops, with fewer Grandmasters and Transcendent Immortal Realm experts than the Warrior Army.</p><p></p><p>Who could have thought,</p><p></p><p>The strength of the White Stone Path would be so formidable.</p><p></p><p>No--</p><p></p><p>To be precise, it is the power of this Overlord Saber that is so terrifying.</p><p></p><p>A Great Grandmaster! This is a true Great Grandmaster! Three strikes to slay the three Transcendent Immortal Realm Elders of the Tian Yang Sword Sect, one strike to kill the Xian-Tian Grandmaster Realm Warrior King Pei Jing, such strength is truly horrifying.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>The North Gate was closed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang saw this scene and immediately ordered the city gates to be opened, personally leading the army to charge forward. In just a moment, he had reached in front of Gu Qingfeng, lifting Pei Jing's corpse and shouting angrily:</p><p></p><p>"Warrior King Pei Jing is dead, those who surrender will not be killed!"</p><p></p><p>"Warrior King Pei Jing is dead, those who surrender will not be killed!"</p><p></p><p>"Warrior King Pei Jing is dead, those who surrender will not be killed!"</p><p></p><p>The three loud shouts echoed through the entire army.</p><p></p><p>In an instant,</p><p></p><p>The remaining Warrior Army, upon seeing Pei Jing's corpse, all revealed expressions of despair and involuntarily dropped their weapons, abandoning resistance.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>As the Warrior Army laid down their resistance, the two revived evil spirits continued to rampage, causing much turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng immediately intervened, suppressing the two evil spirits. Gu Yang then ordered people to bring a golden coffin, completely sealing the two suppressed evil spirits inside.</p><p></p><p>At this point,</p><p></p><p>The battle was truly over.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>Inside the North Gate,</p><p></p><p>In the temporary government office.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's robe was stained with blood, and he had not yet had time to change, but an undisguised smile was on his face.</p><p></p><p>When he saw Gu Qingfeng, he immediately bowed down.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Father!"</p><p></p><p>"You need not be so formal with me, just say what you have to say."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng glanced at him indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang then straightened up, his face full of smiles: "In this battle, Warrior King Pei Jing has fallen, and nearly half of the hundred thousand Warrior Army have surrendered. Our Gu family's army has achieved a great victory.</p><p></p><p>Father, what do you think we should do next?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you already have a plan in mind?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng asked in return.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang did not hesitate and directly nodded, saying: "I think that now the imperial army of Guangyang Prefecture has just been defeated, and we have won a great victory, we should seize the opportunity to conquer the entire Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>With Father's strength as a Great Grandmaster, I believe no one in Guangyang Prefecture can withstand you.</p><p></p><p>As for those sects in the rivers and lakes, they are all opportunists. With Father here, I don't think they would dare to stir up too much trouble!"</p><p></p><p>Riding the momentum of this great victory,</p><p></p><p>Swallowing up Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>This is Gu Yang's goal for the next step.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

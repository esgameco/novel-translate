        <h1>Chapter 238</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>For such a precious treasure, to be honest, it would be impossible for Gu Qingfeng not to be moved. </p><p></p><p>Like the Su family, just by summoning a holy weapon, they could have power rivaling that of a saint. If the full power of a great holy weapon was unleashed, the divine might would be even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng looked at the Divine Phoenix Tower, he could vaguely sense the resistance from this precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>It's clear that.</p><p></p><p>Such a precious treasure cannot be wielded by just anyone.</p><p></p><p>"The fact that you can wield the Divine Phoenix Tower means this treasure recognizes you. You must know that divine weapons have spirits, and with this precious treasure protecting you, you can go even further in the future!"</p><p></p><p>"So you should keep this treasure for yourself, there's no need to give it to me."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head and refused.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Phoenix Tower's resistance meant it did not recognize him.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore.</p><p></p><p>A father should not take away his son's possessions.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Qingfeng's refusal, Gu Yang then took out a black ring.</p><p></p><p>"This is something I obtained from the Great Saint's Secret Realm. If my guess is correct, it should be a storage ring, but unfortunately there are seals on it that ordinary cultivators cannot break.</p><p></p><p>This item, let it be my filial offering to you, father!"</p><p></p><p>"A storage ring—"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the black ring in front of him, his brow slightly raised, then he smiled and accepted it.</p><p></p><p>He could see that Gu Yang truly wanted to do something for him, so Gu Qingfeng did not refuse the other's goodwill.</p><p></p><p>As expected.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng accepted the black ring, a smile appeared on Gu Yang's face.</p><p></p><p>"Now that the imperial court's foundation is shallow, I plan to establish an institution to specifically recruit and cultivate talented cultivators from various sects, in order to strengthen the imperial court's foundation."</p><p></p><p>Finally, Gu Yang said.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng: "These matters, you can take charge of them yourself, the Divine Martial Empire is ultimately your legacy."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>After Gu Yang left.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's gaze returned to the black ring in front of him, and just as Gu Yang had said, it had a powerful seal on it.</p><p></p><p>Such a seal.</p><p></p><p>Even after countless years, it was still extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng grasped the black ring, his Dao Palace spirit shook, and a mighty spiritual power burst forth from within him, slamming heavily onto the black ring.</p><p></p><p>The ring trembled.</p><p></p><p>The numerous seals were now revealed, unfolding endless Dao rhythms, then shattering bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>At the moment the ring broke.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's spiritual sense saw the scene inside.</p><p></p><p>It was about a hundred feet in space, comparable to a palace, but there were only three things placed there.</p><p></p><p>An ancient cauldron! A bloodstained stone! And a jade talisman! Gu Qingfeng imprinted his spiritual mark directly on the black ring, and then a message appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Sky Cloud Ring!"</p><p></p><p>This was the name of the storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took the three items out of the Sky Cloud Ring.</p><p></p><p>First.</p><p></p><p>It was the ancient cauldron.</p><p></p><p>The cauldron was made of bronze, with swirling cloud patterns engraved on it, sometimes seeming to have thunderous transformations, with a dense Dao aura permeating it, exuding a powerful might.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this ancient cauldron, Gu Qingfeng immediately realized that it was a holy weapon.</p><p></p><p>The aura it emanated was even stronger than the Blazing Sun Mirror of the Su family by three times.</p><p></p><p>"A holy weapon!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the one who left behind the Sky Cloud Ring was a Saint?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>One who can wield a holy weapon is most likely a Saint, and judging from the seals on the Sky Cloud Ring, even after so many years, they were still extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>It was only because Gu Qingfeng's spiritual power was strong enough that he could easily break through the seals of the Sky Cloud Ring.</p><p></p><p>If it were other Dao Palace realm cultivators, breaking the seals of the Sky Cloud Ring would be impossible.</p><p></p><p>For this.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also sighed again at Gu Yang's fortune.</p><p></p><p>He truly had an abundant fortune.</p><p></p><p>In the venture into the Great Saint's Secret Realm, he not only obtained a Great Saint's Weapon, but also the legacy left behind by a Saint.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng even suspected that if Gu Xuan had not accompanied him this time, the legacy of the Heavenly Phoenix Great Saint might have fallen into Gu Yang's hands.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>This does not mean that Gu Xuan's fortune is necessarily weaker than Gu Yang's.</p><p></p><p>When both have abundant fortunes, it comes down to a matter of opportunities.</p><p></p><p>But it is undeniable.</p><p></p><p>Both of their fortunes are not weak.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise.</p><p></p><p>They would not have been able to directly obtain the two greatest opportunities in the Great Saint's Secret Realm, while being eyed by many powerful figures.</p><p></p><p>You must know.</p><p></p><p>Before entering the secret realm, one was only at the Washing Marrow Realm, and the other was just a Grand Master at best.</p><p></p><p>Even after emerging from the secret realm, they were still just two Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>Then.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng turned his gaze to the remaining jade talisman.</p><p></p><p>The jade talisman was stained with blood, and when Gu Qingfeng's spiritual sense entered it, a voice suddenly sounded in his ear.</p><p></p><p>"I am called Tian Yun, when you hear these words, I have already perished, there is an ominous aura in the Nine Realms... an opportunity... a great opportunity, enter the Nine Realms... strive for eternal life..."</p><p></p><p>The voice was normal at first, but towards the end it became somewhat panicked, and then it returned to its previous calmness.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>In this calm tone, Gu Qingfeng detected a trace of something unusual.</p><p></p><p>Ominous aura!</p><p></p><p>Great opportunity! Gu Qingfeng looked at the bloodstained jade talisman, as if something on it had come alive, a sinister and cold aura suddenly erupted, and he felt as if he had fallen into endless darkness.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng burst forth with his vital energy, his terrifying blood energy power like the divine sun, sweeping away all the sinister and cold aura.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after.</p><p></p><p>There came a sinister howling sound, and when the darkness receded, Gu Qingfeng looked at the jade talisman again and found that the blood had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic omen—"</p><p></p><p>"A demonic omen that could make even a Saint succumb!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng crushed the jade talisman, his expression more solemn than ever before.</p><p></p><p>After his perfect body refinement and his life level's transformation, Gu Qingfeng no longer took the so-called demonic omen seriously.</p><p></p><p>Especially after Gu Yang established the Divine Martial Empire and forged the Nine Cauldrons to suppress the Nine Realms, demonic omens had completely vanished.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng discovered that the matter was not that simple.</p><p></p><p>The blood on the jade talisman was not just ordinary blood, but had the power of a demonic omen lurking within.</p><p></p><p>Yes.</p><p></p><p>It was a demonic omen!</p><p></p><p>Regarding this power, Gu Qingfeng was naturally no stranger.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that demonic omens were just things that could not be mentioned, but now Gu Qingfeng realized that demonic omens were not that simple.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Yun Saint who left behind the Sky Cloud Ring might have even perished at the hands of a demonic omen.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even so.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was doubtful whether the person who left the jade talisman was truly the Saint of the Heavenly Cloud, and that was a question.</p><p></p><p>"The evil omen that can make even the saints perish, there must be a great secret in the Nine Realms!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took a deep breath and then looked at the blood-stained ore.</p><p></p><p>He tried to use his own spiritual power and blood force on the ore, but it did not trigger the same icy and eerie power as before, but instead a brilliant holy might burst forth.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng determined that the blood on the ore did not come from the evil omen, but from the saint.</p><p></p><p>A stone stained with holy blood! Gu Qingfeng believed that this stone was definitely not as simple as he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise,</p><p></p><p>how could it have been collected by the Saint of the Heavenly Cloud into the Heavenly Cloud Talisman.</p><p></p><p>Then,</p><p></p><p>there was the ancient cauldron.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng's spiritual sense fell on this holy weapon, it immediately triggered the cauldron's strong resistance, with waves of aura overwhelming him.</p><p></p><p>"Resist!"</p><p></p><p>"I do not fear even a living saint, let alone just a holy weapon!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sneered, and then a terrifying spiritual sense far exceeding the Dao Palace realm pounced on the ancient cauldron, and under such absolute power, even a holy weapon could hardly stir up any waves.</p><p></p><p>In an instant,</p><p></p><p>the ancient cauldron trembled and wailed, like a living being unwilling to submit.</p><p></p><p>But under the suppression of absolute power, the cauldron's resistance was almost useless.</p><p></p><p>While suppressing it with his spiritual sense, Gu Qingfeng also clenched his right fist, and the terrifying power that could destroy mountains and rivers heavily struck the ancient cauldron, causing it to tremble violently.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Each punch contained a terrifying spiritual power that could crush any Dao Palace realm expert, and under such fierce attacks, the ancient cauldron shook even more.</p><p></p><p>The original resistance force had now suddenly weakened greatly.</p><p></p><p>Seizing this opportunity, Gu Qingfeng directly imprinted his spiritual mark on the ancient cauldron, and the previous struggle and resistance immediately disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment,</p><p></p><p>some information about the ancient cauldron appeared in Gu Qingfeng's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Cloud Thunder Cauldron!"</p><p></p><p>This was the name of this holy weapon.</p><p></p><p>All holy weapons are distinguished by their grades, and holy weapons are holy weapons. The true determinant of the strength of a holy weapon lies in the cultivator who wields it.</p><p></p><p>Even if it is an early saint realm or a peak saint realm expert, the holy weapons they leave behind are essentially the same in nature.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>the saint power contained in the holy weapons is different.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>as Gu Qingfeng took control of the Cloud Thunder Cauldron, he truly felt the overwhelming power contained in the holy weapon. He tried to activate it with his spiritual power, and a towering holy might instantly burst forth.</p><p></p><p>This holy might,</p><p></p><p>was more than twice as powerful as the holy might the Cloud Thunder Cauldron had previously released on its own.</p><p></p><p>"If I have this Cloud Thunder Cauldron, I probably won't have to waste so much time in my battle with that Blazing Sun Saint!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's mouth curled into a smile.</p><p></p><p>The power of the holy weapon did not disappoint him at all, as it could increase his overall strength by at least 30%.</p><p></p><p>You must know,</p><p></p><p>30% in strength is not a small number.</p><p></p><p>With this holy weapon in hand, even if other sacred lands bring out great holy weapons, Gu Qingfeng would have a chance to fight them.</p><p></p><p>After all -</p><p></p><p>Now that the saints do not come out,</p><p></p><p>the strongest forces that other powers can mobilize are only half-saints.</p><p></p><p>Since his battle with the Blazing Sun Saint, Gu Qingfeng had realized that although he was at the Dao Palace realm, his foundation was strong enough to stand shoulder to shoulder with a true saint.</p><p></p><p>A saint wielding a holy weapon, the power they can unleash naturally cannot be weaker than a half-saint wielding a great holy weapon.</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p></p><p>not everyone can activate the power of a great holy weapon.</p><p></p><p>After taking control of the Cloud Thunder Cauldron, Gu Qingfeng found that if one's cultivation is not high enough, forcibly activating the power of the holy weapon would require the cultivator to sacrifice their own blood.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms,</p><p></p><p>to activate even a little bit of the power of a holy weapon, one needs to be at least at the Dao Palace realm. If one is below the Dao Palace realm, they would have to sacrifice their own blood to activate the power of the holy weapon.</p><p></p><p>Similarly,</p><p></p><p>the threshold for using a great holy weapon is at least saint realm, and non-saints can hardly truly activate the mighty power of a great holy weapon.</p><p></p><p>Although great holy weapons are extremely powerful and can easily slay many cultivators, without truly activating the power within them, to kill a saint is not that simple.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>if there is no saint wielding a great holy weapon, Dao Palace realm cultivators would need to sacrifice their own blood to do so.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>with his strength comparable to a saint and the holy weapon Cloud Thunder Cauldron in his hands, Gu Qingfeng can be said to be in an undefeatable position.</p><p></p><p>The premise is,</p><p></p><p>that no true saints emerge.</p><p></p><p>If saints come wielding great holy weapons, then it would be hard to say.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>there is another way to use holy weapons and great holy weapons, which is to directly activate the saint's spiritual sense left behind, just like the Blazing Sun Mirror.</p><p></p><p>But,</p><p></p><p>the power of any strong person's spiritual sense left behind is limited, and this is the foundation of the various major powers.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>as long as it is not a saint wielding a great holy weapon, even if other half-saints wield great holy weapons, Gu Qingfeng is not afraid.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that the Blazing Sun Mirror was destroyed, otherwise I could have two holy weapons in my hands!"</p><p></p><p>"In that case, my foundation would be even stronger..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng felt a little regretful when he thought about the destroyed Blazing Sun Mirror.</p><p></p><p>But at the time, he had no choice but to use his full strength.</p><p></p><p>If he had held back, perhaps it would have been himself who perished.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>destroying the Blazing Sun Mirror was an unavoidable necessity.</p><p></p><p>If he was at the peak of the Dao Palace realm and could easily suppress the saint's spiritual sense, Gu Qingfeng would certainly have seized the Blazing Sun Mirror for himself.</p><p></p><p>Even if he didn't use it himself, leaving it for his future descendants would not be bad, after all, no one would complain about having too many holy weapons.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>with a thought, the Cloud Thunder Cauldron disappeared and appeared in Gu Qingfeng's dantian dao palace.</p><p></p><p>He had a feeling that as long as he willed it, he could summon the Cloud Thunder Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>This mystical ability,</p><p></p><p>made Gu Qingfeng's expression even more surprised.</p><p></p><p>In comparison,</p><p></p><p>the Slaughter Evil Sword that he had nurtured and refined for many years, could not be directly stored in his dantian like the Cloud Thunder Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>Evidently,</p><p></p><p>to possess such an ability, one would at least need a holy weapon.</p><p></p><p>As for the Slaughter Evil Sword, in Gu Qingfeng's view, since he had nurtured it for many years, it should be considered an ancient weapon. However, this also depends on who wields it.</p><p></p><p>If it fell into the hands of others, the Slaughter Evil Sword would only be an ancient weapon.</p><p></p><p>But if it was wielded by himself, Gu Qingfeng believed he could use the Slaughter Evil Sword to shatter the Blazing Sun Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"If there is a chance, I can refine the Slaughter Evil Sword again. If this divine weapon can be promoted to a holy weapon, the role it can play would definitely be much stronger than the Cloud Thunder Cauldron!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered silently.

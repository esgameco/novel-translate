        <h1>Chapter 237</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In stark contrast to the bloody scene outside the county, </p><p></p><p>Inside the government office.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang spoke: "Father, there are tens of thousands of cultivator corpses outside the city, I'm not sure how to handle this?"</p><p></p><p>"On this matter, I do have some thoughts!" </p><p></p><p>Before Gu Qingfeng could speak, Fu He spoke first.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Qingfeng couldn't help but look at him.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Fu, if you have any insights, please feel free to share."</p><p></p><p>"As is well known, the spiritual energy in the Nine Provinces is now weak, far inferior to the other five domains of the Wasteland Ancient Realm. </p><p></p><p>In the ancient times of old, the spiritual energy of the Nine Provinces was said to be extremely rich, otherwise it would not have given rise to a supreme power.</p><p></p><p>Later, the decline of the Nine Provinces' spiritual energy must be related to that power.</p><p></p><p>In my opinion, for the Divine Martial Kingdom to grow stronger, the spiritual energy issue of the Nine Provinces must be improved, and we cultivators who refine our bodies with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth can be said to be walking spiritual energy springs.</p><p></p><p>Especially for cultivators who have reached the Divine Transformation Realm and above, each drop of their blood is not only filled with all kinds of divine mysteries, but also contains a large amount of heaven and earth's spiritual energy."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, the corpses outside the city should be buried in various parts of the Nine Provinces, using the flesh and blood of these cultivators to nourish the spiritual veins of the Nine Provinces, perhaps there is a chance to restore some of the spiritual energy of the Nine Provinces!"</p><p></p><p>Fu He expressed his views.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Qingfeng's eyes suddenly lit up, and when he looked at Fu He again, his face was full of smiles.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Fu has indeed awakened the dreaming person. Now that the spiritual energy of the Nine Provinces is weak, these cultivators intend to wreak havoc on the Nine Provinces, so it's just right to use their corpses to be buried in the spiritual veins of the Nine Provinces, this way they can be put to good use!"</p><p></p><p>In this battle, </p><p>Gu Qingfeng slaughtered over a hundred thousand cultivators. </p><p>Among them, even the weakest were at the Grand Ancestor Realm, and there were many who had stepped into the Divine Transformation Realm, and even some at the Dao Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>It's worth knowing that a single Dao Palace Realm cultivator can be equivalent to hundreds or even thousands of Divine Transformation Realm cultivators.</p><p>Especially top experts like Shangguan Hongtiān and Qu Huādào in the Dao Palace Realm, their blood and essence are astonishingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>If these cultivator corpses are buried in the Nine Provinces, the power contained within nourishing the spiritual veins, there is indeed hope to restore the spiritual energy of the Nine Provinces.</p><p>Even if it can't match the level of the ancient times, at least it can raise the current spiritual energy significantly.</p><p></p><p>The biggest gap between the Nine Provinces and the other five domains of the Wasteland Ancient Realm is in the concentration of spiritual energy.</p><p>As long as the spiritual energy can catch up, the overall strength of the Nine Provinces can also rise.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Qingfeng was just the lord of a certain force in the Nine Provinces, he wouldn't consider so much for the Nine Provinces, but now that Gu Yang has established the Divine Martial Kingdom and rules the entire Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>In this case, even if Gu Qingfeng doesn't consider for himself, he has to consider for his son.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he looked at Gu Yang beside him.</p><p></p><p>"You should collect all the cultivator corpses outside the city and bury them in the spiritual veins of the Nine Provinces according to Fellow Daoist Fu's words."</p><p></p><p>"I understand, father."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang nodded.</p><p></p><p>Since there is a method to strengthen the spiritual energy of the Nine Provinces, he naturally won't miss the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>After all, this battle made Gu Yang truly realize his own weakness, or rather the weakness of the entire Divine Martial Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for his father's strength comparable to a Saint, the Divine Martial Kingdom might have been destroyed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>So, with the opportunity to enhance the strength of the Divine Martial Kingdom, Gu Yang naturally won't miss it.</p><p></p><p>While Gu Yang stepped forward to arrange for people to handle the matters outside the city, Fu He also met with Gu Qingfeng privately again.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Fu He had an air of hesitation, as if he had something to say but didn't know how to start.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his expression, Gu Qingfeng smiled calmly: "Fellow Daoist Fu, if you have anything to say, please feel free to speak."</p><p></p><p>Fu He hesitated for a moment before carefully asking, "May I ask if Fellow Daoist Gu has already stepped into the Saint Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"I am not a Saint."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this answer, Fu He's expression first eased a bit, and then became filled with awe.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Gu has not yet attained Sainthood, but can break the Saint Weapons of the Shangguan Family and even slay the incarnation of the Flame Yang Saint, such strength truly impresses me!"</p><p></p><p>Not a Saint, yet possessing strength comparable to a Saint! </p><p>Such a powerful expert, becoming a Saint in the future is a sure thing, and once he attains Sainthood, he may become an invincible Saint.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about being able to associate with such a powerful expert, Fu He was secretly excited.</p><p></p><p>Then, Fu He's expression became serious again, reminding: "Fellow Daoist Gu, this time you have slain many cultivators of various forces, this matter will surely spread. </p><p>Although Fellow Daoist Gu's strength is powerful enough to rival Saints, for the top forces, they also possess Saint-level methods, even having the foundation of Great Saints.</p><p>If you become an enemy of these forces, Fellow Daoist Gu still needs to be more careful."</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Fu He didn't expect Gu Qingfeng to act so decisively and ruthlessly, killing all the cultivators without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>After all, there are forces like the Purple Cloud Sacred Land, which has Saint-level power, and the Feathered Immortal Sacred Land, which has previously produced top Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>So the problems involved here are not to be taken lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Like the Purple Cloud Sacred Land, it's still manageable, but the Feathered Immortal Sacred Land has the foundation of a Great Saint, and although they won't easily use their Great Saint treasures, Fellow Daoist Gu still needs to be on guard.</p><p></p><p>In my opinion, if Fellow Daoist Gu has any plans, you can consider joining our Taixu Sacred Land.</p><p>After all, the Taixu Sacred Land has stood in the Eastern Domain for tens of thousands of years, and its foundation is not weak. As long as Fellow Daoist Gu joins the Taixu Sacred Land, even if other forces want to make a move, they will have to think twice!"</p><p></p><p>Fu He made this suggestion, as he had his own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>For a powerful expert like Gu Qingfeng, who is destined to become a Saint in the future, if he can be recruited into the Taixu Sacred Land, the benefits are self-evident.</p><p></p><p>It's easier to add flowers to brocade than to send firewood in the snow.</p><p></p><p>Now that Gu Qingfeng has not yet truly attained Sainthood, if the Taixu Sacred Land can provide him with protection, the future rewards can be abundant.</p><p></p><p>"As for joining the Taixu Sacred Land, I still need to consider it, and I'll give you an answer later, Fellow Daoist Fu."</p><p></p><p>"That's fine."</p><p></p><p>Fu He heard the implied meaning in Gu Qingfeng's words, but since the other party didn't state it absolutely, he just pretended not to have noticed.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Fu He handed a jade token to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"This is my communication jade token, Fellow Daoist Gu, if you have any thoughts in the future, you can contact me with this jade token."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took the communication jade token.</p><p>Although this was the first time he truly encountered such an item, in his past soul-searching memories, he was quite familiar with communication jade tokens.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Fu He left.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Leaving with him was also Gu Xuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Xuan had already taken Fu He as his master, and now that Fu He was leaving, he naturally had to follow.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were a few other reasons for this as well.</p><p></p><p>The first reason was that Gu Qingfeng was clearly aware that he had offended many forces, so sending Gu Xuan to the Taixu Holy Land was a form of protection.</p><p></p><p>If the Gu family and the Divine Martial Empire really ran into trouble, at least there would still be a bloodline left.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the Nine States were ultimately too small. Rather than Gu Xuan staying here, it would be better for him to go to the Taixu Holy Land, where he could grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of outsiders, with Gu Qingfeng, a powerhouse on par with the saints, personally guiding him, he should be more useful than joining other forces.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng was well aware that the foundation of the Taixu Holy Land was extraordinary, and even if he personally pointed the way, it might not necessarily be better than Gu Xuan going to the Taixu Holy Land.</p><p></p><p>Some people were simply not meant to stay idle.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the rapid advancement of Gu Xuan's cultivation after leaving the Gu family manor showed that leaving was better for him than staying in the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>However, before leaving, Gu Xuan did leave behind a copy of the inheritance of the Heavenly Phoenix Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>This inheritance consisted of a cultivation method called the Nirvana Dao Classic and a divine technique called the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Art.</p><p></p><p>The Nirvana Dao Classic was a supreme inheritance that could lead to the ninth layer of the Saint Realm.</p><p></p><p>The problem was that to cultivate the Nirvana Dao Classic, one must possess the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Body, as it was a cultivation method specifically created for that body type.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng, of course, did not have the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Body, as his physique was the Ancient Immortal Body. As for whether the Ancient Immortal Body could cultivate the Nirvana Dao Classic, Gu Qingfeng was not certain.</p><p></p><p>"However," Gu Qingfeng pondered, "even if I don't have the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Body, perhaps I can forcibly cultivate the Nirvana Dao Classic by relying on my Promotion Points!"</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Divine Yang Classic, the Nirvana Dao Classic was undoubtedly much more powerful, both in terms of its upper limit and the strength it could cultivate at each stage.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, if he could switch to cultivating the Nirvana Dao Classic, Gu Qingfeng would be more than willing to do so.</p><p></p><p>As for the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Art, it was a supreme technique created by the Heavenly Phoenix Great Saint, which could be considered a divine technique.</p><p></p><p>Not only was the Heavenly Phoenix Divine Art a divine technique, but even the Desolate Ancient Heavenly Sword that Gu Qingfeng had previously cultivated could be considered a form of divine technique.</p><p></p><p>At this level of supreme techniques, they had already transcended the constraints of mere martial arts, leaning more towards the divine and the Dao.</p><p></p><p>So these supreme techniques could be rightfully called divine techniques.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng</p><p>Age: 52/6000</p><p>Realm: Dao Palace Realm, Sixth Layer</p><p>Martial Arts:</p><p>- Heavenly Vein True Classic (Second Layer)</p><p>- Heavenly Sword (Perfected)</p><p>- Great Desolate Fist Classic (Perfected)</p><p>- Divine Yang Classic (Dao Palace Realm, Fourth Layer)</p><p>- Desolate Ancient Heavenly Sword (Minor Success)</p><p>- Purple Extreme Dao Classic (Perfected)</p><p>- Departing Wind True Classic (Not Entered)</p><p>- Nirvana Dao Classic (Not Entered)</p><p>- Heavenly Phoenix Divine Art (Not Entered)</p><p>Promotion Points: 444</p><p></p><p>After Gu Qingfeng had looked through the two cultivation methods and divine techniques, he turned to his own attribute panel and saw that the Nirvana Dao Classic and Heavenly Phoenix Divine Art had been recorded there.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, a faint smile appeared on Gu Qingfeng's face.</p><p></p><p>"It worked as expected!"</p><p></p><p>He had been worried that the attribute panel would not record them, as that would mean he would have no way to improve them.</p><p></p><p>But now, since the attribute panel had recorded the inheritance of the Heavenly Phoenix Great Saint, it meant he could use his Promotion Points to cultivate these two supreme techniques.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, Gu Qingfeng began to attempt the cultivation of the Nirvana Dao Classic.</p><p></p><p>The Nirvana Dao Classic was divided into seven parts: the Body Tempering Chapter, the Master Chapter, the Grand Master Chapter, the Divine Transformation Chapter, the Dao Palace Chapter, the Saint Chapter, and finally the Great Saint Chapter.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Divine Yang Classic or the current Nirvana Dao Classic, it could be seen that in the Five Domains of the Desolate Ancient Realm, the five stages of Body Tempering had always been a whole, without detailed separation.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, the martial arts of the Nine States had originally separated the five stages of Body Tempering.</p><p></p><p>The reason for this was that the cultivation in the Nine States had declined, and ordinary people had little chance of completing the five stages of Body Tempering, so Mu Rong Xiu had separated them.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, since the five stages of Body Tempering were a stage of refining the foundation, there was no further division of small realms within each layer. Once one entered the first layer, it was the Skin Tempering Realm, and once one entered the second layer, it was the Blood Tempering Realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when Gu Qingfeng was improving, he did not need to go through the four stages of initial, middle, late, and perfected like before.</p><p></p><p>This was not only the case for the Nirvana Dao Classic, but also for the previous Divine Yang Classic.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Qingfeng's view, the reason for this was the issue of the completeness of the martial arts. The more complete the martial arts, the lower the consumption required for advancement, and the more incomplete the martial arts, the higher the consumption required for advancement.</p><p></p><p>It was similar to the concept of martial arts breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the martial arts of the Nine States were incomplete, so each layer of advancement was quite complex.</p><p></p><p>The current Divine Yang Classic and Nirvana Dao Classic were more complete, so they did not have this problem.</p><p></p><p>Of course, whether this was truly the case, Gu Qingfeng could not be certain, it was just his speculation.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng did not immediately cultivate the Nirvana Dao Classic.</p><p></p><p>This was because he currently only had a little over 400 Promotion Points, which, even if used entirely to improve the Nirvana Dao Classic, would at most allow him to reach the Grand Master Realm.</p><p></p><p>No matter how extraordinary the Nirvana Dao Classic was, reaching only the Grand Master Realm would not significantly increase his strength.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Qingfeng naturally would not waste his resources in this way.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Yang also came in from outside.</p><p></p><p>"Father, I have arranged for people to transport all the corpses of the cultivators to the various spiritual veins throughout the Nine States, burying them there to enhance the foundation of the Nine States."</p><p></p><p>"That is for the best. Additionally, these corpses need to be strictly guarded, so they do not fall into the hands of the Sorcerers."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng reminded him.</p><p></p><p>Although the Sorcerers in the Nine States had been dormant, they had not truly been exterminated.</p><p></p><p>If the corpses of cultivators at the Divine Transformation Realm or Dao Palace Realm fell into the hands of the Sorcerers, it would undoubtedly bring a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng was not afraid of such trouble, he disliked it.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said, "I have already arranged for people to handle this properly, so the Sorcerers will not find any opportunities to seize these cultivator corpses."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Gu Yang hesitated for a moment, then his divine sense moved, summoning the Divine Phoenix Pagoda from his dantian.</p><p></p><p>"This treasure left behind by the Great Saint is completely wasted on me. Now that the Divine Martial Empire has offended many enemies, in my opinion, it is best for Father to keep this item."</p><p></p><p>(Chapter End)</p>

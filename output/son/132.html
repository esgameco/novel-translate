        <h1>Chapter 132</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The two armies were on the verge of clashing.</p><p></p><p>Blood and flesh flew everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The cries of battle and the screams of agony blended together, becoming the main melody of the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Shenwu Army, the advantage of the Gu Family Army lay in their occupation of the city walls, allowing them to exert pressure from a higher vantage point.</p><p></p><p>From the moment the two armies engaged in combat,</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family Army had a certain advantage, with the Shenwu Army suffering much heavier casualties.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression did not show much joy at this sight.</p><p></p><p>Because he knew clearly,</p><p></p><p>All of this was only temporary.</p><p></p><p>The battle between the two armies</p><p></p><p>Was not only a contest of military might, but also a test of the abilities of the top experts.</p><p></p><p>Now, the true powerhouses of the Shenwu Army had not yet taken action, and if those existences were to truly make a move, even the North Gate Pass might not be able to stop them.</p><p></p><p>As expected,</p><p></p><p>After the two sides had been fighting for a short while,</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing directly issued an order, and several people suddenly charged out, unleashing powerful blood energy, rushing towards the city gate, intending to break through the gate with brute force, allowing the main army to march in.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivated Impure Martial Artists!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's eyes narrowed slightly, and he immediately ordered a sniper attack.</p><p></p><p>Instantly,</p><p></p><p>Many arrows flew like shooting stars towards those few Impure Realm martial artists. The latter either used their palms or weapons to block, destroying all the incoming arrows.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, the few Impure Realm martial artists had already reached the city gate, when a terrifying aura locked onto them, and arrows that seemed to tear through space shot towards them like rainbow-colored bolts.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>One of the Impure Realm martial artists suddenly thrust his palms forward, generating a fierce gale that created thunderous sounds. But in the next instant, a rainbow-colored light pierced through, completely ignoring the force, and directly penetrated his palms.</p><p></p><p>Blood sprayed.</p><p></p><p>The intense pain caused the Impure Realm martial artist's expression to change, and his figure abruptly retreated, while his blood energy transformed into a protective aura to shield himself.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Just as the protective aura was forming, two more arrows came in quick succession.</p><p></p><p>The first arrow broke through the protective aura.</p><p></p><p>And when the second arrow arrived,</p><p></p><p>"Puchi!"</p><p></p><p>Flesh was pierced.</p><p></p><p>An arrow went straight through his chest, and he looked down at the feather protruding from his chest, his eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>This arrow,</p><p></p><p>Had completely shattered his heart.</p><p></p><p>Even though Impure Realm martial artists have robust life force, they are not invincible, and a fatal injury can still kill them.</p><p></p><p>As his life force rapidly drained away, the light in the Impure Realm martial artist's eyes faded, and his body heavily collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>All of this seemed to happen in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Several more arrows were shot, forcibly pushing the remaining Impure Realm martial artists back.</p><p></p><p>On the city wall, Gu Yi was holding a longbow, his expression cold as he looked down below. He did not strike again, as the previous shot that killed an Impure Realm martial artist had caught the opponent off guard.</p><p></p><p>If he were to act now,</p><p></p><p>At most, he could only kill one or two more Impure Realm martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Rather than taking action,</p><p></p><p>It would be better not to.</p><p></p><p>This level of deterrence would be enough to make these martial artists hesitate to act.</p><p></p><p>"Powerful blood energy, complete internal organs, I didn't expect the Gu Family Army to have such a high-level expert!" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Ning's eyes were fixed on Gu Yi, the latter's overwhelming blood energy power stirring up a sense of yearning within him.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family Army to have such a foundation.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that in the vast White Stone Dao, the only one worth paying attention to was the rumored peak Dao Ancestor-level expert, the Tyrannical Saber Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, there were other powerful experts here besides the Hegemon Blade.</p><p></p><p>Perfected Foundation Establishment realm masters! </p><p></p><p>Just one step away from truly entering the Patriarch realm.</p><p></p><p>Such martial artists, even within the Tianyang Sword Sect, could be considered quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>"Three Perfected Foundation Establishment realm masters guarding the city, no wonder Gu Yang has the confidence to contend with our Shenwu Army. Now that the Hegemon Blade has not arrived, we have no need to continue wasting time.</p><p></p><p>Next, please have the elders take action and break through the enemy's defenses, completely capturing Beimen Pass!"</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing looked at the figures on the city wall, their powerful auras clearly indicating their extraordinary abilities.</p><p></p><p>Perfected Foundation Establishment realm!</p><p></p><p>And there were three of them!</p><p></p><p>Such a force could be considered truly astonishing.</p><p></p><p>At least since Pei Jing entered Taishan Prefecture, cities with so many powerful experts guarding them could be counted on one hand. No wonder Gu Yang had the confidence to withstand the Shenwu Army.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for a few Tianyang Sword Sect elders stationed here, and with these powerful experts coordinating the city's defense, the Shenwu Army might not have much chance of success.</p><p></p><p>However, these were all just assumptions.</p><p></p><p>In reality, their side had three Nascent Soul realm mages stationed here.</p><p></p><p>In that case, these mere Foundation Establishment realm martial artists were nothing to worry about.</p><p></p><p>"You two need not fight me, these three Foundation Establishment realm martial artists are mine. After capturing Beimen Pass, I don't want a single one of the ten thousand Gu Clan soldiers!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ning spoke first, his gaze towards Beimen Pass holding a bloodthirsty glint that flashed briefly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Laoqiu and Cui Mingfeng exchanged a glance and both nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Very well!"</p><p>"Then let Elder Jiang have them."</p><p></p><p>In their words, it was as if Beimen Pass was at Jiang Ning's complete disposal.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Ning smiled, then suddenly stepped into the air, his body surging towards the city gate like a giant crane.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying, icy aura burst forth, causing the temperature in the air to plummet.</p><p></p><p>"Master, be careful!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi's expression changed, and he gathered a powerful force in his palms, intending to knock Jiang Ning down.</p><p></p><p>However, the latter, still in mid-air, casually struck out with a palm.</p><p></p><p>The two palms collided.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi's body was struck as if by lightning, instantly sent flying.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ning, on the other hand, did not retreat even a step, landing directly on the city wall.</p><p></p><p>Standing with his hands behind his back, his fearsome aura intimidated the surrounding soldiers, who dared not approach.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Ning's gaze fell on the leading Gu Yang, his eyes flashing with a scarlet hue as a savage expression appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, so you are Gu Yang?</p><p>Gu Qingfeng killed my Tianyang Sword Sect elder, and now I shall first kill you as interest, then annihilate the entire Gu Clan to avenge my Tianyang Sword Sect elder!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Jiang Ning's right hand suddenly struck out, a terrifying force surging towards Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's Perfected Blood Realm cultivation was like a mere illusion before this power, and the chilling, horrifying aura swept over him, causing his entire body and blood to feel as if they had frozen, making it nearly impossible for him to move.</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Yang thought he was going to die here, a sword's hiss was heard from behind him, and a long blade was drawn.</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>The blood-red blade light illuminated the sky, accompanied by a domineering, unparalleled sword intent.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 132</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The two armies were on the verge of clashing.</p><p></p><p>Blood and flesh flew everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The cries of battle and the screams of agony blended together, becoming the main melody of the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Shenwu Army, the advantage of the Gu Family Army lay in their occupation of the city walls, allowing them to exert pressure from a higher vantage point.</p><p></p><p>From the moment the two armies engaged in combat,</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family Army had maintained a certain advantage, with the Shenwu Army suffering much heavier casualties.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression did not show much joy at this sight.</p><p></p><p>Because he knew,</p><p></p><p>All of this was only temporary.</p><p></p><p>The battle between the two armies,</p><p></p><p>Was not only a test of military strength, but also a test of the abilities of the top experts.</p><p></p><p>Now, the true powerhouses of the Shenwu Army had not yet taken action, and if those existences were to truly unleash their might, even the North Gate Pass might not be able to withstand them.</p><p></p><p>As expected,</p><p></p><p>After the two sides had been fighting for a short while,</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing directly ordered, and several people suddenly charged out, unleashing powerful blood energy, rushing towards the city gate, intending to break through the gate with brute force and allow the main army to march in.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivated Impure Martial Artists!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's eyes narrowed slightly, and he immediately ordered a sniper attack.</p><p></p><p>Instantly,</p><p></p><p>Many arrows flew towards those few Cultivated Impure Martial Artists, but they either used their palms to block or used their weapons to deflect, destroying all the incoming arrows.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, the Cultivated Impure Martial Artists had already reached the city gate, when a terrifying aura locked onto them, and arrows that seemed to tear through space shot towards them like lightning bolts.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>One of the Cultivated Impure Martial Artists slammed his palms forward, generating a fierce gale that created thunderous sounds, but in the next instant, a rainbow-colored light pierced through, completely ignoring the force and directly penetrating his palm.</p><p></p><p>Blood sprayed.</p><p></p><p>The intense pain caused the Cultivated Impure Martial Artist to change expression, his figure suddenly retreating explosively, while his blood energy transformed into a protective aura to shield himself.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Just as the protective aura was forming, two more arrows came in quick succession.</p><p></p><p>The first arrow broke through the protective aura.</p><p></p><p>And when the second arrow arrived,</p><p></p><p>"Puchi!"</p><p></p><p>The flesh was pierced.</p><p></p><p>An arrow went through his chest, and he looked down at the feathers on his chest with disbelief in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This arrow,</p><p></p><p>Had completely shattered his heart.</p><p></p><p>Even though Cultivated Impure Martial Artists had strong life force, they were not invincible, and a fatal injury would still kill them.</p><p></p><p>As his life force rapidly drained away, the light in the Cultivated Impure Martial Artist's eyes faded, and his body heavily fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>All of this seemed to happen in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Several more arrows were shot, forcibly pushing the remaining Cultivated Impure Martial Artists back.</p><p></p><p>On the city wall, Gu Yi held a longbow, his expression cold as he looked down, not striking again, as the previous shot that killed one Cultivated Impure Martial Artist had caught the opponent off guard.</p><p></p><p>If he were to act now,</p><p></p><p>At most, he could only kill one or two more Cultivated Impure Martial Artists.</p><p></p><p>Rather than taking action,</p><p></p><p>It would be better not to.</p><p></p><p>This level of deterrence would be enough to make these martial artists hesitate.</p><p></p><p>"Powerful blood energy, complete internal organs, I didn't expect the Gu Family Army to have such a high-level expert!" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Ning's eyes were fixed on Gu Yi, the overwhelming blood energy power of the other party stirring up a sense of impulse within him.</p><p></p><p>He also didn't expect,</p><p></p><p>That the Gu Family Army would have such a foundation.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that in the vast Baishi Dao, the only one worth paying attention to would be the rumored top-tier True Meaning Sect Master, the Tyrannical Saber Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, there were other powerful experts here besides the Hegemon Blade.</p><p></p><p>Perfected Foundation Establishment realm masters! </p><p></p><p>Just one step away from truly entering the Patriarch realm.</p><p></p><p>Such martial artists, even within the Tianyang Sword Sect, could be considered quite impressive.</p><p></p><p>"Three Perfected Foundation Establishment realm experts guarding the city, no wonder Gu Yang has the confidence to contend with our Divine Martial Army. Now that the Hegemon Blade has not arrived, we have no need to continue wasting time.</p><p></p><p>Next, please have the elders take action and break through the enemy's defenses, completely capturing Beimen Pass!"</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing looked at the figures on the city wall, their powerful auras clearly indicating their extraordinary abilities.</p><p></p><p>Perfected Foundation Establishment realm!</p><p></p><p>And there were three of them!</p><p></p><p>Such a force could be considered truly astonishing.</p><p></p><p>At least since Pei Jing entered Taishan Prefecture, cities with so many powerful experts guarding them could be counted on one hand. No wonder Gu Yang had the confidence to withstand the Divine Martial Army.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for several Tianyang Sword Sect elders stationed here, and with these experts coordinating the city's defense along with the geographical advantages of Beimen Pass, the Divine Martial Army might not have much chance of success.</p><p></p><p>However, these were all just assumptions.</p><p></p><p>In reality, their side had three Spiritualist Realm masters stationed here.</p><p></p><p>In that case, these mere Foundation Establishment realm martial artists were nothing to worry about.</p><p></p><p>"You two, don't fight me for this. These three Foundation Establishment realm martial artists are mine. After capturing Beimen Pass, I don't want a single one of the ten thousand Gu Clan soldiers!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ning spoke first, his gaze towards Beimen Pass containing a bloodthirsty glint that flashed by.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Qiu and Cui Mingfeng exchanged a glance and both nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>"Then let Elder Jiang have them."</p><p></p><p>In their words, it was as if Beimen Pass was completely at Jiang Ning's mercy.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Ning immediately smiled, and then they saw him step into the air, his body soaring towards the city gate like a great crane.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying, icy aura burst forth, causing the temperature in the air to plummet.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, be careful!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi's expression changed, and he gathered a powerful force in his palms, intending to knock Jiang Ning down.</p><p></p><p>However, the latter, while still in mid-air, casually struck out with a palm.</p><p></p><p>The two palms collided.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi's body was struck as if by lightning, and he was instantly sent flying.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ning, on the other hand, did not retreat even half a step, directly landing on the city wall.</p><p></p><p>Standing there with his hands behind his back, his terrifying aura intimidated the surrounding soldiers, who did not dare to take a single step forward.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Ning's gaze fell on the leading Gu Yang, his eyes flashing with a scarlet hue as a ferocious expression appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, so you are Gu Yang?</p><p>Gu Qingfeng killed my Tianyang Sword Sect elder, and now I will first kill you as interest, and then exterminate the entire Gu Clan to avenge my Tianyang Sword Sect elder!"</p><p></p><p>As Jiang Ning spoke, his right hand suddenly struck out, and a terrifying force surged towards Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's Perfected Blood Realm cultivation was like a mere illusion before this power, and the chilling, terrifying aura that swept over him caused his entire body to feel as if his blood and qi had stagnated, making it nearly impossible for him to move.</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Yang thought he was going to die here, a sound of a sword being drawn suddenly came from behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>A blood-red sword light flashed across the sky, accompanied by a domineering and unparalleled sword intent.</p>

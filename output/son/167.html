        <h1>Chapter 167</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>The ancient saying goes, looking at Gu Qingfeng, he couldn't help but ask again: "Senior Gu, it is a principle that evil spirits cannot be killed. How is it that you are able to slay them?"</p><p></p><p>This question.</p><p></p><p>Had been weighing heavily on his mind.</p><p></p><p>Until now.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Cloud could no longer hold it back and asked.</p><p></p><p>Even Gu Yang's expression showed curiosity about this.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the two of them and calmly said: "The reason evil spirits cannot be killed is that the martial cultivators' level of life is not high enough. The evil spirits' level of life is higher. Only by reaching the same level as the evil spirits can one slay them.</p><p></p><p>This is the fundamental reason why evil spirits are difficult to kill, but evil spirits can devour other evil spirits!"</p><p></p><p>The level of life!</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Ancient Cloud and Gu Yang both looked at each other in bewilderment. </p><p></p><p>To them,</p><p></p><p>these four words seemed rather obscure.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "The martial dao in the world is flawed. Ordinary masters can only live for 500 years, and even peak masters can only live for about 800 years at most."</p><p></p><p>"This kind of martial dao not only cannot allow martial cultivators to transcend their level of life, but even their lifespan will be greatly reduced."</p><p></p><p>The martial dao is flawed?</p><p></p><p>This sentence.</p><p></p><p>Made the two change expression again.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Cloud couldn't help but ask further: "Senior Gu said that the martial dao in the world is flawed, so what is the so-called flawless martial dao?"</p><p></p><p>"Flawless martial dao!"</p><p></p><p>"Refining the skin can live for 180 years, refining the blood can live for 400 years, refining the bones can live for 750 years, and if one can refine the marrow, one may live for 1,200 years. If one can refine the viscera, one can live for 2,000 years!"</p><p></p><p>"If one can perfectly refine the viscera, the martial cultivator's level of life can be transcended, and they can be on the same level as evil spirits!"</p><p></p><p>"If one can break through the barrier of refining the viscera and attain the realm of a master, one can live for 3,000 years!"</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Gu Qingfeng had fully explained the perfect martial dao to others.</p><p></p><p>Or rather.</p><p></p><p>This should be called the flawless martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Compared to this martial dao, the previous martial dao can only be considered as poor imitations. Only this kind of martial dao is the truly pure and authentic martial dao.</p><p></p><p>This speech.</p><p></p><p>Shook Ancient Cloud's heart and spirit.</p><p></p><p>Refining the viscera for 2,000 years! Masters for 3,000 years! This was something he had never dared to imagine.</p><p></p><p>If these words had come from someone else, Ancient Cloud would have thought they were just talking nonsense.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>Since these words came from Gu Qingfeng's mouth, it was different.</p><p></p><p>After all, this person is the number one in the martial dao today, and what he said must not be false.</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's slaying of evil spirits is a well-known fact.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Cloud did not doubt the truth of Gu Qingfeng's words.</p><p></p><p>Immediately,</p><p></p><p>Ancient Cloud deeply bowed to Gu Qingfeng, pleading with reverence: "Please, senior, teach me the flawless martial dao!"</p><p></p><p>This was Ancient Cloud's only thought now.</p><p></p><p>The flawless martial dao!</p><p></p><p>After understanding this martial dao, Ancient Cloud was eager to obtain it.</p><p></p><p>He was very clear.</p><p></p><p>If the flawless martial dao emerges, the situation of the sorcerers ruling the world will be completely broken.</p><p></p><p>"Although I have already stepped into the flawless martial dao, it is not easy to truly establish a brand-new martial dao. Up to now, I have only glimpsed the mysteries of the flawless martial dao.</p><p></p><p>This Longevity Sutra is the initial martial dao I created. If you have any ideas, you can also study it!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng casually handed the Longevity Sutra he had written down to Ancient Cloud.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the latter immediately felt as if he had obtained a priceless treasure.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Ancient Cloud eagerly opened the Longevity Sutra, his whole person completely...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Immersed in it of his own volition.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>The ancient cultivator, Gu Yun, finally emerged from the Longevity Sutra with a face full of shock.</p><p></p><p>Although the Longevity Sutra now only recorded the cultivation method of the Refine Skin Realm, the profundity within it almost captivated Gu Yun.</p><p></p><p>He had a premonition.</p><p></p><p>If he could cultivate this Longevity Sutra, even just the first chapter on the Refine Skin Realm, it could further advance his own strength.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that Gu Yun had already stepped one foot into the ranks of the Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>Rather than calling him a True Meaning Grand Master, it would be more accurate to say he was a Half-Step Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>At Gu Yun's level, unless he could break through to become a Grand Master, or comprehend even more profound True Meanings, his strength had almost reached its limit.</p><p></p><p>But now, in the Longevity Sutra, Gu Yun saw the hope to advance further.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Gu Yun took a deep breath and solemnly paid his respects to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Today, Disciple has been granted the Longevity Sutra by the Master, allowing Disciple to witness the true flawless martial dao. In the future, Disciple shall serve as your disciple and attend to you."</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master Gu has spoken too highly. A little martial exchange need not be so formal," Gu Qingfeng shook his head in refusal.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Yun's attitude this time was very firm, and he said seriously, "In the pursuit of the martial dao, there is no precedence, and the teacher is the one who has attained it. Master Gu has bestowed upon Disciple the Longevity Sutra, a great kindness that Disciple could never forget."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Gu Yun was determined to be his disciple, Gu Qingfeng did not continue to argue.</p><p></p><p>It's fine this way.</p><p></p><p>With this relationship in place, the Divine Martial Sect could truly be used for his own purposes.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng also handed another copy of the Longevity Sutra to Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>"The Longevity Sutra is not yet perfected. You may research it with confidence, but without my permission, it cannot be disseminated."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Both Gu Yun and Gu Yang nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'm a bit weary from this battle as well. The matter here is settled, and I won't linger in the capital city. As for the remaining affairs, handle them as you see fit."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at Gu Yang and instructed, then departed leisurely.</p><p></p><p>He had come here only to deal with the Heaven Yang Sword Sect, but now that Gu Yutian and all the powerful cultivators from the Heaven Yang Sword Sect had been slaughtered, there was no need for him to stay any longer.</p><p></p><p>In this battle, Gu Qingfeng had also gained a clear understanding of his own strength.</p><p></p><p>With his current Extreme Dao Sect Master cultivation, he was roughly on par with the peak Transformation Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But if he were to utilize a Heaven Vein, he could easily subdue the latter.</p><p></p><p>If he used two Heaven Veins, experts like Gu Yutian would be unable to withstand even a single strike from him.</p><p></p><p>Even if cultivators above the Transformation Realm were to emerge, Gu Qingfeng would still be confident in fighting them.</p><p></p><p>After Gu Qingfeng's departure, Gu Yang immediately summoned all the generals.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall, over a dozen generals gathered.</p><p></p><p>Their expressions were filled with awe and their gazes had become much more fervent.</p><p></p><p>The battle in front of the capital city had already spread far and wide.</p><p></p><p>They naturally understood that behind their lord, Gu Yang, stood an unparalleled expert.</p><p></p><p>Even the strongest cultivators of the Imperishable Sects had been slain on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, with such a powerful backer, Gu Yang was destined to have the qualifications to contend for the Heavenly Throne.</p><p></p><p>If they followed Gu Yang and he one day ascended to that position, the benefits they would receive as his loyal subjects were unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Especially for those generals who had previously served the court and the Divine Martial Army, they now felt their decision to submit to Gu Yang was extremely wise.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

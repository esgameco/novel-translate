        <h1>Chapter 117</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Duan Pingtou did not even turn back as he tried to flee from the Divine Fist Sect.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, just as his body was about to leap up, a flash of a blade appeared and directly split him in half.</p><p></p><p>Blood sprayed across the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>A Xiantian Sect Master had fallen on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Weak!"</p><p></p><p>"He was truly too weak!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng revealed a look of disappointment.</p><p></p><p>He had originally thought that Duan Ping, being a Xiantian Sect Master, could bring him some surprises, but he never expected this person's strength to be several levels weaker than Shen Wudao.</p><p></p><p>At least, although Shen Wudao had died, he had still fought a great battle with Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>But observing Duan Ping, he was directly slain in just one encounter.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's previous awe towards Xiantian Sect Masters had now completely collapsed.</p><p></p><p>It is true that Sect Masters are stronger than ordinary small sects, but they are not as terrifying as Gu Qingfeng had imagined.</p><p></p><p>However, this is also related to the fact that Duan Ping had not cultivated any demonic techniques.</p><p></p><p>If the opponent had cultivated demonic techniques and imitated Shen Wudao, then the combined power of the Taoist arts and martial arts would have been quite different.</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch's divine might is unparalleled in the world!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Peng immediately praised, his face filled with reverence.</p><p></p><p>To slay a Sect Master with a single sword strike!</p><p></p><p>One could ask how many powerful experts in the rivers and lakes could achieve this.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful figure was the existence that Gu Peng had been following all along.</p><p></p><p>The other outer disciples who witnessed this scene were also shaken in their hearts, looking at Gu Qingfeng with awe and worship.</p><p></p><p>In the chaotic world, the strong are respected.</p><p></p><p>The stronger Gu Qingfeng's strength was displayed, the more assurance it brought to them.</p><p></p><p>To follow such a powerful figure was a great blessing in life.</p><p></p><p>Stepping on the bones of many Divine Fist Sect warriors, </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's clothes were not stained with a single drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>The long sword was sheathed.</p><p></p><p>He slowly said, "Search the entire Divine Fist Sect thoroughly, eliminate any survivors, and bring all the sect's secret scriptures back to the Gu Family Manor. Those who died or were injured in this battle will be compensated by the manor."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The disciples followed the order.</p><p></p><p>Thereupon, led by Gu Peng, the other disciples formally entered the Divine Fist Sect and began to execute the orders of eliminating survivors and looting the sect.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>In the main hall of the Divine Fist Sect,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sat on the former Sect Master's throne, below which was a golden coffin sealing the Vajra Buddha.</p><p></p><p>The coffin was covered in fresh blood, each drop containing an extremely powerful and scorching aura. This was the pure Yang Qi blood that Gu Qingfeng had cultivated.</p><p></p><p>This was the result of breaking through the limit of the Azure Yang Sutra, condensing this powerful pure Yang Qi blood.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Azure Yang Sutra was only a supreme martial art, and the pure Yang Qi it cultivated could not possibly suppress such an evil entity.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Qingfeng possessed many martial arts, and his Qi blood had been tempered countless times, allowing him to cultivate pure Yang Qi blood that was incomparable to that of the Azure Yang Sutra.</p><p></p><p>The difference between the two was like the difference between the bright moon and a firefly.</p><p></p><p>"In other words, the strength of my Qi blood is now terrifying, even compared to that of ordinary Qi Blood Sect Masters!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured to himself, recalling his battle with Shen Wudao, which had given him a clearer understanding of his own strength.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Gu Qingfeng had only been silently improving his strength, rarely having the opportunity to truly display it. Whenever he did act, it was usually to swiftly eliminate his opponents.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had not truly encountered any powerful experts who could match him in battle.</p><p></p><p>Until this time, </p><p></p><p>his battle with the Sect Master of the Divine Fist Sect from hundreds of years ago finally allowed Gu Qingfeng to truly understand the stage his strength was at.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His qi and blood were extremely robust.</p><p></p><p>He could be compared to a qi and blood grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>It could even be said that he was stronger than the average qi and blood grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with the profound meaning of the Eighth-Level Tyrannical Saber,</p><p></p><p>In a certain sense,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was now at least equivalent to a profound meaning grandmaster, and he might even be much stronger than the average profound meaning grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary grandmasters were nothing to him.</p><p></p><p>This was evident from the fact that Duan Ping was instantly killed.</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know how I would fare against the so-called great grandmasters!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered.</p><p></p><p>The great grandmasters,</p><p></p><p>This realm that only existed in rumors, he had not yet had the chance to experience.</p><p></p><p>But after this battle, Gu Qingfeng had gained immense confidence.</p><p></p><p>Don't be fooled by the fact that this world reveres sorcerers, but when martial artists reach a certain level of strength, they are not necessarily weaker than sorcerers.</p><p></p><p>The top-tier spirit-controlling sorcerers are no more than the equivalent of ordinary grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng suspected that he was about on par with Duan Ping.</p><p></p><p>Compared to veteran grandmasters like Shen Wudao, he was a step behind.</p><p></p><p>In the Guangyang Prefecture,</p><p></p><p>The many century-old sects and noble families all had spirit-controlling sorcerers at the helm.</p><p></p><p>In other words,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng discovered that his current strength seemed to be unmatched in the entire Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>Except for the evil entity in the Nine Twists Dao.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Evil Buddha was not something that Shen Wudao could compare to.</p><p></p><p>Even if Gu Qingfeng now had the strength to slay Shen Wudao, he did not have the confidence to face the Evil Buddha of the Nine Twists Dao.</p><p></p><p>As for the subsequent slaying of Duan Ping, Gu Qingfeng was not afraid of offending the Taiyang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>To be honest,</p><p></p><p>Ever since the death of Jie Zong, the Gu Family Manor had already torn off its mask with Pei Jing.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the annihilation of the Shenquan Sect, they had thoroughly offended the other party.</p><p></p><p>As Duan Ping said,</p><p></p><p>In such a situation, for the Gu Family Manor to mend relations, the only option was to submit to Pei Jing, or rather, submit to the Taiyang Sword Sect behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately,"</p><p></p><p>"Gu has never had the habit of being someone's dog."</p><p></p><p>"If the Taiyang Sword Sect is offended, so be it. I want to see just how much substance this so-called immortal sect has!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes grew cold.</p><p></p><p>Since they had offended them, there was no need to hesitate.</p><p></p><p>When the time comes to cut, don't hesitate, or else you'll suffer the consequences.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>From the moment Duan Ping opened his mouth, it was already determined that he had to die.</p><p></p><p>After all, even if Duan Ping was spared, there was no possibility of mending relations between the two sides. Since that was the case, then killing Duan Ping first to weaken the Taiyang Sword Sect's strength was not a bad idea.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later,</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng arrived.</p><p></p><p>Behind him were several outer sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>They brought over more than a dozen boxes and lined them up in front of Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"All the martial arts scriptures of the Shenquan Sect are in these boxes, and there is also some gold, please take a look, Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng said with a cupped fist salute.</p><p></p><p>Gold!</p><p></p><p>At the mention of this word, Gu Qingfeng's eyes immediately lit up.</p><p></p><p>What was the most lacking thing now? Apart from the martial arts scriptures, the remaining thing was gold.</p><p></p><p>Gold was the most important thing for sealing evil entities, without gold, the evil entities would be difficult to suppress, after all, they were hard to slay, and Gu Qingfeng currently did not have a method to exterminate the evil entity.</p><p></p><p>The remaining gold in the Gu Family Manor was only used as the final seal for the sarcophagus of the Vajra Buddha.</p><p></p><p>Now that a batch of gold had been found in the Shenquan Sect, it was just the right solution to the pressing problem.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

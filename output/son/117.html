        <h1>Chapter 117</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Duan Pingtou did not even look back as he tried to flee from the Divine Fist Sect.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, just as his body was about to leap up, a flash of a blade appeared and directly split him in half.</p><p></p><p>Blood spilled across the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>A Xiantian Sect Master had fallen right then and there.</p><p></p><p>"Weak!"</p><p></p><p>"He was truly too weak!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's face was filled with disappointment.</p><p></p><p>He had originally thought that Duan Ping, being a Xiantian Sect Master, could bring him some surprises. But he never expected this person's strength to be several levels weaker than Shen Wudao.</p><p></p><p>At least Shen Wudao, though dead, had fought a great battle with him.</p><p></p><p>But observing Duan Ping, he was directly slain in just one encounter.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's previous awe towards Xiantian Sect Masters had now completely collapsed.</p><p></p><p>It is true that Sect Masters are more powerful than ordinary small sects, but they are not as terrifying as Gu Qingfeng had imagined.</p><p></p><p>However, this is also related to the fact that Duan Ping did not cultivate any evil techniques.</p><p></p><p>If the opponent had cultivated evil techniques and emulated Shen Wudao, then the combined power of the Taoist arts and martial arts would have been quite different.</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch's divine might is unparalleled in the world!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Peng immediately praised, his face filled with reverence.</p><p></p><p>Slaying a Sect Master with a single blade! </p><p></p><p>One must wonder how many powerful experts in the rivers and lakes can achieve this.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful figure is the very existence that he has been following all along.</p><p></p><p>The other outer disciples, seeing this scene, were also greatly shaken, looking at Gu Qingfeng with awe and worship.</p><p></p><p>In this chaotic world, the strong are respected.</p><p></p><p>The stronger Gu Qingfeng's displayed strength, the more assurance it brings to them.</p><p></p><p>To follow such a powerful figure is indeed a great fortune in one's life.</p><p></p><p>Stepping on the bones of many Divine Fist Sect practitioners, </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's clothes were not stained with a single drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>The long sword was sheathed.</p><p></p><p>He slowly said, "Thoroughly search the entire Divine Fist Sect, eliminate any survivors, and bring all the sect's secret manuals back to the Gu Family Manor. Those who died or were injured in this battle will be compensated by the manor."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The disciples followed the order.</p><p></p><p>Then, led by Gu Peng, the other disciples formally entered the Divine Fist Sect and began to execute the order of eliminating survivors and looting the sect.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>In the main hall of the Divine Fist Sect,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sat on the former Sect Master's precious seat, below which was a golden coffin that sealed the Vajra Buddha.</p><p></p><p>The coffin was covered in fresh blood, each drop containing an extremely powerful and scorching energy. This was the pure Yang Qi blood that Gu Qingfeng had cultivated.</p><p></p><p>This was the result of breaking through the limit of the Azure Yang Sutra, condensing this pure Yang Qi power.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Azure Yang Sutra is only a supreme martial art, and the pure Yang Qi it cultivates cannot possibly suppress such an evil entity.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Qingfeng possessed many martial arts, and his Qi blood had been tempered countless times, allowing him to cultivate pure Yang Qi blood that was incomparable to that of the Azure Yang Sutra.</p><p></p><p>The difference between the two was like the difference between the bright moon and a firefly.</p><p></p><p>"In other words, the intensity of my Qi blood is now terrifying, even compared to ordinary Qi Blood Sect Masters!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured to himself, recalling his battle with Shen Wudao, which gave him a clearer understanding of his own strength.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Gu Qingfeng had only been silently improving his abilities, rarely having the chance to truly display them.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he did act, it was usually to swiftly eliminate his opponents.</p><p></p><p>Truly powerful experts who could fight him on equal terms were actually quite scarce.</p><p></p><p>Until this time, </p><p></p><p>his battle with the Sect Master of the Divine Fist Sect from hundreds of years ago finally allowed Gu Qingfeng to truly understand the stage his strength was at.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His qi and blood were extremely robust.</p><p></p><p>He could be compared to a qi and blood grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>It could even be said that he was stronger than the average qi and blood grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with the profound meaning of the Eighth-Level Tyrannical Saber,</p><p></p><p>In a certain sense,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was now at least equivalent to a profound meaning grandmaster, and he might even be much stronger than the average profound meaning grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary grandmasters were already insignificant before him.</p><p></p><p>This could be seen from how Duan Ping was instantly killed.</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know how I compare in strength to the so-called great grandmasters!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered.</p><p></p><p>The great grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>This realm only existed in rumors, and he had not yet had the chance to experience it.</p><p></p><p>But after this battle, Gu Qingfeng had gained tremendous confidence.</p><p></p><p>Don't be fooled by the fact that this world reveres sorcerers, but when martial artists reach a certain level of strength, they are not necessarily weaker than sorcerers.</p><p></p><p>Even peak Spirit Monarch sorcerers are only equivalent to ordinary grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng suspected that he was about on par with Duan Ping.</p><p></p><p>Compared to veteran grandmasters like Shen Wudao, he was a step behind.</p><p></p><p>In the Guangyang Prefecture,</p><p></p><p>Many century-old sects and noble families all had Spirit Monarch sorcerers as their mainstays.</p><p></p><p>In other words,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng discovered that his current strength seemed to be unmatched in the entire Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>Except for the evil entity in the Nine Twists Dao.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Evil Buddha was not something that Shen Wudao could compare to.</p><p></p><p>Even if Gu Qingfeng now had the strength to slay Shen Wudao, he did not have the confidence to face the Evil Buddha of the Nine Twists Dao.</p><p></p><p>As for the subsequent slaying of Duan Ping, Gu Qingfeng was not afraid of offending the Taiyang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>To be honest,</p><p></p><p>Ever since the death of Seasonal Sect's patriarch, the Gu family manor had already torn off its mask with Bai Jing.</p><p></p><p>Now, after annihilating the Divine Fist Sect, they had thoroughly offended the other party.</p><p></p><p>As Duan Ping said,</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, for the Gu family manor to mend relations, the only option was to submit to Bai Jing or, in other words, submit to the Taiyang Sword Sect behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately,"</p><p></p><p>"Gu has never had the habit of being someone's dog."</p><p></p><p>"Offending the Taiyang Sword Sect is fine, I want to see just how much substance this so-called immortal sect has!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes turned cold.</p><p></p><p>Since they had offended them, there was no need to hesitate.</p><p></p><p>It's better to act decisively than to be indecisive and suffer the consequences.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>From the moment Duan Ping opened his mouth, it was already determined that he had to die.</p><p></p><p>After all, even if Duan Ping was spared, there was no possibility of mending relations between the two sides. Since that was the case, then killing Duan Ping first to weaken the Taiyang Sword Sect's strength was not a bad idea.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later,</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng arrived.</p><p></p><p>Behind him were several outer sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>They brought over more than a dozen boxes and lined them up in front of Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"All the martial arts scriptures of the Divine Fist Sect are in these boxes, and there is also some gold here. Please take a look, Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng said with a cupped fist salute.</p><p></p><p>Gold!</p><p></p><p>Hearing those two words, Gu Qingfeng's eyes immediately lit up.</p><p></p><p>What was the most lacking thing now? Apart from the martial arts scriptures, the remaining thing was gold.</p><p></p><p>Gold was the most important thing for sealing evil entities. Without gold, it would be difficult to suppress the evil entities, as they were hard to slay, and Gu Qingfeng currently did not have a method to exterminate the evil entity.</p><p></p><p>The remaining gold in the Gu family manor was only for the final sealing of the sarcophagus of the Vajra Buddha.</p><p></p><p>Now, finding a batch of gold from the Divine Fist Sect was just the timely solution to this pressing issue.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

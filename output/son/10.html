        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Entering the Blood Mist.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng found that his vision had become much blurred.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>A strange, icy cold aura permeated the air, giving one a chilling sensation.</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression was slightly panicked as he stuck closely to Gu Qingfeng, afraid that something strange might appear in the blood mist.</p><p></p><p>"With me here, there's no need to be afraid."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was solemn. The blood mist in front of him could obstruct vision, and if ordinary people entered it, they would easily lose their way, but after breaking through the Blood Refining Realm, his senses had become much stronger, and the blood mist could no longer truly obstruct his visual perception.</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Qingfeng was leading Gu Yang forward, suddenly they saw blurry shadows swaying in the blood mist. When they approached and took a closer look, they realized that these so-called shadows were actually several corpses hanging from the trees.</p><p></p><p>Each corpse had been disemboweled and hung by the neck with ropes, their ghastly faces already greatly decayed, their empty eyes staring upwards like the souls of the underworld gazing upon the living.</p><p></p><p>This sudden turn of events</p><p></p><p>startled Gu Qingfeng, and the pale-faced Gu Yang beside him was even more frightened.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored mist.</p><p></p><p>The withered tree trunks and the corpses.</p><p></p><p>Whoever suddenly saw this scene would be shocked.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>after the initial shock, Gu Qingfeng looked at the several corpses on the trees and saw a familiar feeling in their decaying faces.</p><p></p><p>"Liu Hong!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Liu Hong.</p><p></p><p>A senior instructor at the Golden Bull Martial Arts Hall. </p><p></p><p>He had joined the Golden Bull Martial Arts Hall for many years and was an experienced master in the Blood Refining Realm. Gu Qingfeng never expected him to die here.</p><p></p><p>Clearly,</p><p></p><p>this person had also sensed that something was amiss, so he had quietly left, but unexpectedly ended up dying here.</p><p></p><p>Although the corpse was already somewhat decayed, Gu Qingfeng could still see a lot from the surface.</p><p></p><p>There were no signs of struggle.</p><p></p><p>The other party had been killed in a single fatal blow.</p><p></p><p>To be able to instantly kill a Blood Refining Realm warrior, it showed that the thing in the blood mist was absolutely not simple.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>a sudden sense of alarm rose in Gu Qingfeng's heart. He quickly pulled Gu Yang aside, then instantly activated the Iron Body Incantation, and his right fist shot out like a cannon, colliding with a black shadow.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!"</p><p></p><p>The two forces collided, and the black shadow was instantly flung away, and Gu Qingfeng's own body was also pushed back a few steps by a huge force.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, a Blood Refining Realm warrior, I didn't expect the little Linxian County to be so surprising!"</p><p></p><p>A low voice came, and the black shadow attacked again. This time, Gu Qingfeng finally saw the other party clearly.</p><p></p><p>It was a tall, thin middle-aged man, his face covered in fresh blood, his eyes as fierce as a venomous snake. His movements were as swift as lightning, and Gu Qingfeng was slightly alarmed, not daring to be careless, and directly unleashed his full strength to fight against him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng activated the power of his flesh and blood, and a wolf-like aura rose above his head, his Toppling Mountain Fist powerful and heavy, each punch sounding like a violent explosion.</p><p></p><p>"Wolf-like Aura!"</p><p></p><p>"You are no ordinary Blood Refining Realm warrior!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the wolf-like aura appear, Shangguan Jiang was also slightly startled. He had not expected Linxian County, such a small place, to produce a Blood Refining Realm warrior.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, </p><p></p><p>The other party was also a practitioner who had cultivated the Qi and Blood Wolf Smoke, reaching the Blood Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>Immediately,</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jiang's eyes grew increasingly cold, his tongue licking the corner of his mouth stained with fresh blood, his face revealing an extremely sinister expression.</p><p></p><p>"The internal organs of a Qi and Blood Wolf Smoke martial artist must be much more delicious than those of an ordinary person. Obediently give up your struggle and die, and I might be able to make your death less painful!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke,</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jiang unleashed a fierce attack. Gu Qingfeng remained calm and composed in his response, but every time his fists and feet collided with the other party, he felt an extremely strange aura invading his body, as if it was trying to corrode and freeze him.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Gu Qingfeng's Qi and Blood were robust, surging like a mighty river, and his pure and vigorous Qi and Blood power forcibly dispersed this cold and gloomy aura.</p><p></p><p>"The Qi and Blood Wolf Smoke martial artist is indeed no ordinary person!" </p><p></p><p>Seeing that Gu Qingfeng had been fighting with him for a long time, yet his movements remained unimpeded, Shangguan Jiang's face darkened.</p><p></p><p>"Let me make you understand that martial artists can never rise to the upper echelons—"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jiang's face became ferocious, his gaze extremely cold. Suddenly, the flesh and blood of his right hand withered, turning into a ghastly black demonic hand, which unleashed a strange and powerful force to strike.</p><p></p><p>Boom—</p><p></p><p>With another punch, Gu Qingfeng only felt a stinging pain in his fist, and saw that several hideous wounds had appeared on the back of his right hand, with the flesh and blood rotting in a ghastly manner.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of technique is this?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was also startled, the changes in Shangguan Jiang catching him off guard. Even the invulnerable Iron Body Technique and the Shattering Mountain Fist could not withstand the other party's attacks.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jiang's expression was frenzied, his eyes filled with ruthless killing intent, and the strange aura around him grew even more intense.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng realized that he had no room for retreat. This battle would either end with him slaying the person before him, or both of them perishing here.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>He no longer cared about anything else.</p><p></p><p>It's either life or death! The mighty Qi and Blood Wolf Smoke, Gu Qingfeng's fists shook the mountains as he engaged in a fierce battle with Shangguan Jiang.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Rumble! Amidst the blood mist, the thunderous sounds never ceased, the two figures constantly fighting. The Iron Body Technique's defense could not withstand the attacks of the demonic hand, but Shangguan Jiang himself was not invincible either, sustaining numerous injuries from Gu Qingfeng's attacks.</p><p></p><p>Yet both of them seemed to be completely numb to the pain, each determined to kill the other.</p><p></p><p>"Boom—"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jiang's demonic hand grasped Gu Qingfeng's shoulder, the five fingers easily piercing through the skin defense and sinking into the flesh and blood. The excruciating pain in his shoulder caused Gu Qingfeng's face to contort, but instead of retreating, he surged forward, seizing the opportunity to deliver a powerful punch to the other's chest.</p><p></p><p>The mighty and forceful attack caused Shangguan Jiang's chest to cave in, his body being flung away like a defeated weed.</p><p></p><p>For an ordinary person,</p><p></p><p>Such injuries would have been fatal.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jiang still did not die.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for him to struggle back to his feet, Gu Qingfeng took three steps in two, raining down a barrage of punches on the other.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>A look of fear finally appeared on Shangguan Jiang's face.</p><p></p><p>"You cannot kill me... I... I am a member of the Zhenxie Mansion—"</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jiang tried to speak, hoping to intimidate Gu Qingfeng with his identity as a member of the Zhenxie Mansion, but Gu Qingfeng completely ignored his words, his mind focused on one thing: killing the man before him.</p><p></p><p>As Gu Qingfeng delivered the final punch, Shangguan Jiang's head suddenly exploded, and the headless corpse twitched briefly before becoming completely motionless.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

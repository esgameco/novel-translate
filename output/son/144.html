        <h1>Chapter 144</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain 368 Refine Skin Realm martial artists!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain 126 Refine Blood Realm martial artists!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain 3 Refine Bone Realm martial artists!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by a mysterious powerful expert!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has gained some insights through the slaughter, and his tyrannical saber techniques have become more refined!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has sent people to the Crimson Flame Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Shengnan' has cleansed his root foundation, and his talent has slightly improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has practiced the Gu Family Fist with some insights, and his strength has improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has led a large army to conquer a city, and his fame has spread far and wide..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Line after line of text was refreshing on the information panel, and Gu Qingfeng looked at the content with a relatively calm expression.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Sect! If it were in the past, Gu Qingfeng would have been quite wary of the Crimson Flame Sect.</p><p></p><p>After all, as a thousand-year-old sect, the Crimson Flame Sect's foundation was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>However, </p><p></p><p>the times have changed.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Qingfeng's eyes, the Crimson Flame Sect was just a minor matter.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had five peak Xiantian experts following him, so solving a Crimson Flame Sect would naturally be no problem.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention a single Crimson Flame Sect, </p><p></p><p>even if it were ten Crimson Flame Sects, Gu Qingfeng believed they could be easily suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was not too concerned about it.</p><p></p><p>Now, </p><p></p><p>he no longer constantly stares at the information panel.</p><p></p><p>Because, </p><p></p><p>Gu Peng has already returned.</p><p></p><p>He has also brought back dozens of boxes of martial arts secret manuals.</p><p></p><p>Now, </p><p></p><p>these martial arts secret manuals are all placed in the Grinding Knife Hall, for Gu Qingfeng to ponder and study day and night.</p><p></p><p>To create a perfect martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's goal is not just for the future generations of the Gu family, but more importantly, to find a path forward for himself.</p><p></p><p>After all, </p><p></p><p>the martial dao in the world is limited to the Great Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>Since ancient times, </p><p></p><p>there has never been anyone who could break through the limit of the Great Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>At least, </p><p></p><p>in Gu Qingfeng's current understanding, the Great Grandmaster is the limit of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, </p><p></p><p>Great Grandmasters are extremely rare in the world.</p><p></p><p>Many martial artists can only reach the Grandmaster realm when it comes to the secret realms of martial arts in the world.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has Grandmaster-level secret manuals in his hands, but that is not enough, he needs to refine the martial arts of various schools and create his own path.</p><p></p><p>Only by doing so, </p><p></p><p>even if he breaks through the limits of martial arts in the future, his martial arts will be far superior to ordinary martial arts.</p><p></p><p>It's a simple principle.</p><p></p><p>Take the initial low-grade martial arts as an example.</p><p></p><p>An ordinary low-grade martial art, and a low-grade martial art that can perfectly refine the skin, the effects of their upgrades and breakthroughs are different.</p><p></p><p>The former, after breaking through, would be an ordinary Refine Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>The latter, if it breaks through, it may very well be a perfect Refine Blood.</p><p></p><p>Of course, </p><p></p><p>nothing is absolute.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng does not currently possess a perfect martial dao, so he can only speculate for now, and cannot be 100% certain.</p><p></p><p>But at least from the current situation, the probability of this is not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng is so obsessed with the perfect martial dao.</p><p></p><p>If he can create his own martial dao and walk the path of the perfect martial dao, then even if the martial arts in the world are limited to the Great Grandmaster realm, he can still break through the limits with his perfect martial dao and master even greater power.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ten days later, </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had a vague idea.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, </p><p></p><p>a secret guard envoy came to seek an audience, and also handed a letter to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He opened the letter and looked at the content, his brow slightly furrowed, his expression turning cold.</p><p></p><p>"What a Crimson Flame Sect, it seems they have not grasped their own status and position!"</p><p></p><p>This letter was sent by Gu Yang's secret agent.</p><p></p><p>The content of the letter was very simple.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Sect was willing to submit to the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Sect also had a request, which was that they needed the Gu Family Manor to provide one thousand commoners every year to supply the cultivation needs of the sect.</p><p></p><p>In fact.</p><p></p><p>This was not an unreasonable demand.</p><p></p><p>After all, these thousand-year-old ancestral sects all had cultivators stationed there.</p><p></p><p>The existence of these cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Was inseparable from the flesh and blood of living beings.</p><p></p><p>Throughout history, whenever someone wanted to rally these ancestral sects, they had to pay a certain price.</p><p></p><p>Like the Tian Yang Sword Sect behind Pei Jing, and some of the supporting ancestral sects, they almost all had corresponding demands, and the former had to agree to them if they wanted to get their support.</p><p></p><p>There's no way around it.</p><p></p><p>This is how the world is.</p><p></p><p>These things are also the tacitly accepted rules.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that I, Gu Qingfeng, have never been one to follow the rules, and the tacitly accepted rules in the world may not necessarily be correct."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sneered, his true qi surging, and the letter instantly turned to ash.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng casually took a piece of white paper, directly wrote a single character on it, and handed it to the secret agent.</p><p></p><p>"Take this to Yan'er."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>The secret agent took the order and immediately turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng resumed his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But unlike before, he now had a sharp, murderous aura about him, enveloping the entire Grinding Pavilion, causing all the divine weapons within to tremble slightly, as if in fear, or perhaps in excitement.</p><p></p><p>After a long time.</p><p></p><p>This murderous aura gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>The secret agent saw Gu Yang again.</p><p></p><p>"How did Father respond?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>The secret agent respectfully presented an envelope, saying, "This is what the Old Manor Lord instructed me to deliver to the Manor Lord."</p><p></p><p>When no one was around, the secret agent referred to Gu Qingfeng as "Honored Patriarch", but now in front of Gu Yang, he had to call him "Old Manor Lord".</p><p></p><p>After all.</p><p></p><p>The secret agent was now openly loyal to Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang didn't really care about these matters of address. He opened the envelope that Gu Qingfeng had the secret agent bring, and as soon as the white paper unfolded, a powerful aura of killing intent emanated from it.</p><p></p><p>This killing intent was terrifyingly strong, and when Gu Yang's gaze fell upon it, his eyes even felt a slight sting, making it difficult to look directly at.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until a moment later that this killing intent subsided, and he was finally able to clearly see the content on the paper.</p><p></p><p>Kill!</p><p></p><p>A simple, straightforward character.</p><p></p><p>But upon seeing this "kill" character, Gu Yang already understood Gu Qingfeng's intentions.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Father's thoughts are the same as mine!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>He himself was also not fond of the Crimson Flame Sect.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Sect had already expressed willingness to submit to the Gu Family Manor. If they were to eliminate the Crimson Flame Sect at this time, it would inevitably tear off the last layer of pretense and put them in opposition to all the cultivators in the world.</p><p></p><p>After all.</p><p></p><p>Since ancient times, any strong figures who were able to stabilize the supreme position in the world had the shadows of immortal sects or ancestral families behind them.</p><p></p><p>In other words.</p><p></p><p>The rulers of the world were all supported by these cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The scramble of warlords in the late dynasties was essentially a game of strategy among the cultivators, to see who could ultimately emerge victorious.</p><p></p><p>This shows.</p><p></p><p>The status of the cultivators is extremely high.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

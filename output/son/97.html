        <h1>Chapter 97</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng let out a long sigh, and then he turned his gaze towards the Patriarch's True Intent Diagram before him.</p><p></p><p>This time, Gu Qingfeng discovered that the Patriarch's True Intent within the Patriarch's True Intent Diagram had completely dissipated and vanished.</p><p></p><p>Just as he had expected.</p><p></p><p>The true essence contained within the Patriarch's True Intent Diagram could only allow him to cultivate up to the seventh level of True Intent.</p><p></p><p>This was an unavoidable situation.</p><p></p><p>If it had been the Patriarch's True Intent Diagram from its peak period, Gu Qingfeng believed it could have allowed him to cultivate up to the eighth or even ninth level of True Intent.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this Patriarch's True Intent Diagram had fallen into the Zhuo family's hands for many years, and the Patriarch's True Intent it contained had already diminished significantly. Now, it could only allow one to cultivate up to the seventh level of True Intent, which was about its limit.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Patriarch's True Intent had dissipated, leaving behind just an ordinary painting with no further use.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, Gu Qingfeng approached the desk, unfolded a sheet of xuan paper, closed his eyes, and focused his mind in deep contemplation. He then reopened his eyes and began to swiftly depict a brand-new painting with his brush and ink.</p><p></p><p>In the next instant, the xuan paper suddenly shattered, scattering into countless fragments in the air.</p><p></p><p>Witnessing this, Gu Qingfeng shook his head slightly: "As expected, the power of True Intent is beyond the capacity of ordinary paper to withstand. Even if I wish to leave behind my own True Intent, I must find a corresponding treasure that can bear the power of True Intent."</p><p></p><p>He had wanted to emulate the previous example and leave behind his own True Intent power. Unfortunately, ordinary xuan paper could not endure it.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch's True Intent Diagram provided by the Zhuo family was clearly made of materials more extraordinary than common objects.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Qingfeng temporarily abandoned the idea of leaving behind a True Intent diagram.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the method of truly preserving True Intent was not limited to just this one way. If he could emulate the previous examples and use a special treasure to hold the True Intent, then such True Intent could be preserved for a much longer time.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The breakthrough in True Intent had allowed Gu Qingfeng to feel his strength increase further.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, he continued to cultivate other supreme martial arts and to ponder the profound mysteries of the Tyrannical Saber Slash.</p><p></p><p>Although the Patriarch's True Intent in the painting had been exhausted, this did not mean that he no longer had the possibility of further advancement.</p><p></p><p>It just meant that without the Patriarch's True Intent to assist him, his subsequent progress would be much slower.</p><p></p><p>For this reason, Gu Qingfeng established the Whetstone Hall, where he collected some of the weapons left behind by the martial artists he had slain in the past, storing them in the Gu family's treasury. He intended to utilize the power of these myriad slain warriors to refine his own True Intent.</p><p></p><p>After all, any weapon used by a martial artist for a period of time would inevitably retain some unique aura, or "charm," to varying degrees.</p><p></p><p>However, these divine weapon charms were often extremely faint and difficult to perceive. Even if one could detect them, they would not have a significant effect.</p><p></p><p>Only the divine weapons wielded by the most supreme experts, constantly tempered by the strong cultivators' own cultivation and imbued with the blood of their vanquished foes, would possess a truly powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Whetstone Hall contained only a few such divine weapons - those that had belonged to martial artists at the Refined Bone Realm and above.</p><p></p><p>At the very center of the Whetstone Hall stood a rack made of mysterious iron, upon which the Demon-Slaying Saber was placed.</p><p></p><p>By regularly maintaining this saber, Gu Qingfeng's connection with it grew ever deeper, allowing this divine weapon to gradually evolve to an even higher level.</p><p></p><p>Since the establishment of the Whetstone Hall, Gu Qingfeng had spent most of his time...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng would often stay here to cultivate, rarely leaving the place, sometimes staying for days on end.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, he would come out for a walk, guide Gu Yang in his cultivation, and spend some time with Xu Yulan, as well as visit his two young sons.</p><p></p><p>This was how his life went.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that everything had returned to true tranquility.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The morning sun shone down.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sat cross-legged in the Grinding Hall, when suddenly, the yang energy of the great sun streamed in through the skylight and entered his abdomen, causing the power of the Azure Yang Technique to rapidly operate, silently and effortlessly breaking through from the fifth layer to the initial stage of the sixth layer.</p><p></p><p>The breakthrough from the fifth layer to the sixth layer was the difference between refining the blood and refining the bones.</p><p></p><p>Before the sixth layer, it was the cultivation of the blood level, but from the sixth layer onward, it involved the realm of bone refinement.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng felt the pure yang energy and blood power cultivated by the Azure Yang Technique fuse into the bones throughout his body. The bones, which had already been tempered to a terrifying degree, now had some impurities expelled.</p><p></p><p>After the impurities were expelled, Gu Qingfeng felt that his entire golden skeleton had become even more rounded, but to say it was truly flawless, there was still a slight difference.</p><p></p><p>"When the Azure Yang Technique is further improved, I should be able to continue tempering my golden skeleton. If I can cultivate a perfect physical body in various martial arts, my strength will definitely undergo a fundamental transformation!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng felt the changes in his physical body, with some impurities expelled and the circulation of his flesh and blood flowing smoothly, his strength also having a slight increase.</p><p></p><p>Although this increase was not very obvious, at his current level, every bit of improvement was not to be taken lightly.</p><p></p><p>Three days after Gu Qingfeng's breakthrough, Gu Yang came again.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Father!"</p><p></p><p>In the Grinding Hall, Gu Yang cupped his hands in salute, and his gaze involuntarily fell on the Demon-Slaying Sword in the center.</p><p></p><p>The divine weapon had a spirit. The powerful sword intent contained within it influenced the tyrannical sword intent he had comprehended, as if the two were subtly resonating with each other.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng opened his eyes, his body still sitting cross-legged, and slowly said, "Speak, what has happened?"</p><p></p><p>"There is a great change in the Nine Curved Path. The Zhuo family and the Crimson Flame Sect, as well as other thousand-year-old ancestral sects, have jointly entered the Nine Curved Path, intending to suppress that evil entity, but they have all ended in failure."</p><p></p><p>"The outside world rumor has it that the evil entity's strength is extremely terrifying, and tens of thousands of citizens in Cloud Mountain City have perished at the hands of the evil entity. The Demon-Subduing Mansion has also heard that several Enlightened Spirit Realm experts have been killed, including the Deputy Commander of the Guangyang Prefecture Demon-Subduing Mansion, Jiang Qin!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang spoke truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Hearing his words, a brilliant light flashed in Gu Qingfeng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Is this news accurate?"</p><p></p><p>"It's about 90% accurate!"</p><p></p><p>As Gu Yang said this, he paused for a moment, then continued.</p><p></p><p>"If those sects had not entered the Nine Curved Path and engaged in a great battle with that evil entity, this news would not have been able to spread.</p><p></p><p>I also tried to send people to the Nine Curved Path to investigate the news, and it seems that the court is also gradually evacuating the citizens from the Nine Curved Path, and the Demon-Subduing Mansions of various prefectures are also taking action, intending to join forces to deal with that evil entity!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's words made Gu Qingfeng's expression slightly grave.</p><p></p><p>If the court has indeed taken such actions, then this rumor is likely true.</p><p></p><p>After all, if it were not the case, the court would not have made such a big move.</p><p></p><p>As Gu Qingfeng was pondering, Gu Yang said, "The evil entity in the Nine Curved Path has caused a huge commotion, and someone from the court has also come to the Gu Family Manor, wanting to request that Father lend a hand to jointly slay the evil entity.</p><p></p><p>However, since Father was in seclusion before, I did not disturb him."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

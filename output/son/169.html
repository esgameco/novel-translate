        <h1>Chapter 169</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, when Gu Yang seized Huaining Prefecture, the other three prefectures were not as smooth.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" </p><p></p><p>"The first to scale the city walls will be greatly rewarded!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhen's expression was cold and sharp as he solemnly ordered, gazing at the majestic city walls ahead.</p><p></p><p>And on the battlefield,</p><p></p><p>The Guangyang army was frantically attacking the city.</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhen had now received the news that Gu Yang had seized the entire Huaining Prefecture, and the progress of the other two prefectures was also not slow.</p><p></p><p>Only the resistance in Yixing Prefecture was particularly strong.</p><p></p><p>As for this,</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhen naturally hoped that he could quickly capture Yixing Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>It's simple.</p><p></p><p>He was originally a general of the Shenwu Army, and after Pei Jing's defeat, he defected to Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhen was very clear.</p><p></p><p>As a defeated general like him, it was difficult to be highly valued.</p><p></p><p>The reason he was able to lead an army was because the foundation of the Guangyang King was weak, and he had no capable generals under him, so Shi Zhen had the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>But as more and more people came under the Guangyang King's command, it became increasingly unlikely that Shi Zhen would continue to be highly valued.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhen must demonstrate his own powerful abilities.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing Yixing Prefecture was an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment, in the city, an order arrow suddenly shot into the sky, and fireworks burst open, clearly visible even in broad daylight.</p><p></p><p>"The assassins have succeeded!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the appearance of the order arrow, Shi Zhen's expression brightened.</p><p></p><p>Before the attack on the city, he had secretly sent assassins to infiltrate the city and seize the city gate.</p><p></p><p>Now that the order arrow had been released, it was enough to indicate that the seizure of the city gate had been successful.</p><p></p><p>As expected.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Shi Zhen's thoughts fell, the tightly closed city gate slowly opened.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene,</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhen immediately spurred his horse and charged into the battlefield, directly leading the main army to charge towards the city.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Whetstone Hall,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the constantly updating information panel, his expression very calm.</p><p></p><p>Given that he had killed the Ancient Yuetian, it was only natural that Gu Yang would use the overwhelming momentum to sweep across the various regions, and the imperial court dared not resist.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not have the intention to attack the Tianyang Sword Sect for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Simply put,</p><p></p><p>The Tianyang Sword Sect was in Nanyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>At present, Gu Yang had not even captured Taishan Prefecture, let alone enter Nanyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>Another reason why Gu Qingfeng was not in a hurry to attack the Tianyang Sword Sect was that since the Ancient Yuetian had died, the strong figures of the Tianyang Sword Sect had mostly been wiped out.</p><p></p><p>The remaining remnants of the sect, how much of a storm could they stir up.</p><p></p><p>The battle in front of the prefecture city,</p><p></p><p>Let Gu Qingfeng have a clear understanding of his own strength.</p><p></p><p>His current foundation,</p><p></p><p>Was enough to overwhelm the entire Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were so-called Transcendent Realm old monsters lurking among the unparalleled sects and families of the Nine Provinces, Gu Qingfeng was not the least bit afraid.</p><p></p><p>This was something he was confident about.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Yuetian was already a top expert in the Nine Provinces, yet he was still unable to withstand Gu Qingfeng's single sword strike. This battle record alone was enough to reveal many things.</p><p></p><p>Now...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was waiting.</p><p></p><p>Waiting for Gu Yang and his other descendants to grow up.</p><p></p><p>If he could obtain more cultivation points, Gu Qingfeng could then condense the third and even the fourth heavenly meridians.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, Gu Qingfeng deeply understood the importance of each heavenly meridian.</p><p></p><p>Whether to activate the heavenly meridians or not, that was a different concept.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, he had only condensed two heavenly meridians, yet he was already so powerful. If he could one day condense nine heavenly meridians, that would be truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng was increasingly curious about the powerful cultivators who created the Heavenly Meridian Sutra.</p><p></p><p>Given the terrifying nature of the Heavenly Meridian Sutra, what kind of extraordinary cultivators were able to create such an invincible cultivation method?</p><p></p><p>Even the Longevity Sutra he had created might not necessarily be as powerful as the Heavenly Meridian Sutra, for the nine great heavenly meridians could increase one's strength ninefold, which was truly formidable.</p><p></p><p>Of course, to be precise, the direction of the Longevity Sutra was different from the Heavenly Meridian Sutra. The Heavenly Meridian Sutra was more focused on enhancing combat power, without any help for the cultivator's own realm, let alone extending lifespan.</p><p></p><p>The Longevity Sutra, on the other hand, was mainly aimed at improving the cultivator's cultivation and extending lifespan.</p><p></p><p>The Perfect Martial Dao! It was exactly like this!</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the information panel, Gu Qingfeng then continued to ponder on the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Gu Qingfeng opened his eyes. He looked at his own attribute panel and found that the information about the Longevity Sutra had changed somewhat.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Longevity Sutra (Perfected, Longevity Level 2)!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I've broken through! The second layer of the Longevity Sutra is enough to allow for perfect blood refinement!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had a faint smile on his face. He had originally thought that it would take a lot of time to create the second layer of the Longevity Sutra, but now he found that the actual situation was much better than he had expected.</p><p></p><p>The battle in Guangyang Prefecture had given him some unique insights, and now, after a period of seclusion in the Whetstone Hall, the blood refinement chapter of the Longevity Sutra had been completed naturally.</p><p></p><p>Now that the blood refinement chapter of the Longevity Sutra was complete, Gu Qingfeng had entered the realm of perfection.</p><p></p><p>Fundamentally, it was because Gu Qingfeng had already walked this path before, and the Longevity Sutra he created was essentially a recreation of his previous path.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when the blood refinement chapter of the Longevity Sutra emerged, Gu Qingfeng was able to perfect it naturally.</p><p></p><p>"However, the more advanced the Longevity Sutra becomes, the greater the difficulty in creating it. If I were to break through the limits by using cultivation points, I could save a lot of effort."</p><p></p><p>"But in that case, the consumption of cultivation points would be quite large, which might not be worth it."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was creating the Longevity Sutra step by step, but the improvement of his own strength could not be slowed down for a moment. Even now, with the strength to contend for the peak of the Nine Provinces, he still felt it was not enough in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng looked at the information panel again. After three days, a large amount of new information had been refreshed, all of which were related to Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>From the information panel, it could be seen that in the past three days, about five prefectures had fallen into Gu Yang's hands, which meant that he had basically taken control of half the power of the Taishan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Yang has already taken control of five prefectures out of the twelve in Taishan Prefecture. It seems that he is not far from controlling the entire Taishan Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng mused.</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

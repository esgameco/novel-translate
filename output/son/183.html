        <h1>Chapter 183</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The other party has always been arrogant and haughty, not caring much about the people under heaven, and also a bit impulsive in their actions.</p><p></p><p>But now that Gu Yang has sent Gu Yi to seek the Zhu Xie Sword, it has actually made Gu Qingfeng quite pleased.</p><p></p><p>It shows that Gu Yang has grown a lot since becoming the King of Guangyang.</p><p></p><p>After all, only by maintaining a sense of awe can one go further.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Gu Qingfeng's words, Gu Yi could only lower his head and remain silent. </p><p></p><p>This kind of talk was not something a subordinate like him should interject.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, Gu Qingfeng stretched out his hand and beckoned, and the Zhu Xie Sword in the center of the Whetstone Hall immediately responded and fell into his hand.</p><p></p><p>The Cultivating Sword Art had nurtured the Zhu Xie Sword for many years, and with the true essence and Gu Qingfeng's power refining it day and night in the Whetstone Hall, this divine weapon was now far beyond its former self.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Gu Qingfeng drew the sword, and the blood-red sword light illuminated the Whetstone Hall. Gu Yi only felt a chill, as if something terrible was staring at him, and his entire body was covered in goosebumps.</p><p></p><p>His gaze at the Zhu Xie Sword was filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>A single sword! </p><p></p><p>It made him feel such a strong sense of threat, showing the formidable power of the Zhu Xie Sword.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Yi had already witnessed the divine might of the Zhu Xie Sword before, when it had slain an elder of the Tian Yang Sword Sect in the battle at the North Gate Pass, its strength being truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Under Gu Yi's astonished gaze, Gu Qingfeng flicked his finger, and a drop of golden blood shot out from his fingertip, embedding itself like a golden gem into the hilt of the Zhu Xie Sword.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a golden light flashed on the Zhu Xie Sword, followed by a powerful and heavy aura that permeated outward.</p><p></p><p>The long sword was sheathed, and the aura dissipated.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, Gu Qingfeng handed the Zhu Xie Sword to Gu Yi.</p><p></p><p>"Tell Yang'er that this sword contains a drop of my essence blood, which can unleash its power three times, and even evil spirits can be slain by it!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Yi reverently accepted the Zhu Xie Sword, and although it was just a long sword, it gave him a sense of weight heavier than a thousand jin.</p><p></p><p>Thereupon, Gu Yi left, carrying the Zhu Xie Sword.</p><p></p><p>After Gu Yi's departure, Gu Qingfeng continued to ponder the martial arts, and the powerful aura of the true essence permeated and ravaged the Whetstone Hall. If there were any divine weapons that could sense this level of true essence power, they would tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>If there were any strong cultivators who had mastered the true essence and entered the Whetstone Hall, they would discover that the divine weapons under Gu Qingfeng's constant illumination of the true essence had begun to develop a certain degree of spirituality, and each divine weapon was emanating a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>Such high-level divine weapons, if placed outside, would be enough to drive anyone crazy.</p><p></p><p>However, in the face of the Zhu Xie Sword, these divine weapons would seem somewhat inadequate.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the days that followed, Gu Qingfeng continued to seclude himself in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Gu Yi had brought the Zhu Xie Sword to the capital city and handed it over to Gu Yang, also faithfully conveying Gu Qingfeng's words.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang's expression immediately brightened.</p><p></p><p>"Good, with this sword, the Tian Yang Sword Sect will not be a concern!"</p><p></p><p>If Shen Wu Sect intervened, Gu Yang would have a ninety percent chance of being able to eliminate the Tian Yang Sword Sect. But now, with the Zhu Xie Sword in hand, his confidence was a full hundred percent.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang absolutely believed in Gu Qingfeng's words.</p><p></p><p>The next day, the army set out.</p><p></p><p>One hundred and thirty thousand strong.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang left thirty thousand troops to guard Taishan Prefecture, and the remaining hundred thousand troops marched towards Nanyang Prefecture in a grand display.</p><p></p><p>This news soon spread...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The news of Gu Yang's arrival shook the entire Nanyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The various large and small powers, upon hearing the news of Gu Yang's coming, were all inwardly filled with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>A person's name is like the shadow of a tree.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang, the King of Guangyang, was already renowned, and the martial arts saint behind him was even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Gu Qingfeng had struck down that one blow outside the capital of Guangyang Prefecture, the entire Guangyang Prefecture had gradually taken on the aura of a martial arts holy land, and many martial artists had gone there to comprehend the lingering, inextinguishable sword intent.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the reputation of Guangyang Prefecture had grown even stronger.</p><p></p><p>And as the King of Guangyang, Gu Yang's reputation had also risen along with it.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' is leading a million-strong army to attack Nanyang Prefecture, and many powers are surrendering one after another!"</p><p></p><p>"The forces under your offspring 'Gu Yang' have greatly increased!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has achieved astonishing battle feats, and his reputation has soared!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by a Xiantian Grandmaster*3!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain *7 Xiwashou realm martial artists!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain *43 Liangugong realm martial artists!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain *669 imperial soldiers!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has gained some insights in the battle, and his Hegemon Sword has become even more profound!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has gained some insights in the battle, and his cultivation has slightly advanced!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain *1236 imperial soldiers!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The moment Gu Yang launched the war, the information panel was constantly updating with a large amount of text.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the content on the panel, his expression remarkably calm.</p><p></p><p>The war had begun.</p><p></p><p>It was destined that the killing would not cease.</p><p></p><p>When he saw that Gu Yang had been attacked by a Xiantian Grandmaster, Gu Qingfeng was not too surprised.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Yang's attack on Nanyang Prefecture had touched the interests of too many powers, and these powers, even if they feared the Gu family patriarch behind Gu Yang, would still desperately fight back in such a situation.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng was not too worried.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Yang had bodyguards accompanying him, and even if a Xiantian Grandmaster intervened, it would be difficult to threaten his existence.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the support of the Shenwu Sect and other strong forces, Gu Yang had already accumulated an astonishingly powerful force.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the support of strong forces! Ever since Gu Qingfeng had slain the Ancient御天, Gu Yang's reputation had greatly increased, and then the support of the Shenwu Sect had further propelled his fame to the peak.</p><p></p><p>As a result, many jianghu powers and scattered martial artists had joined Gu Yang's camp to serve him.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, even without counting the bodyguards, the forces under Gu Yang's command were already quite formidable.</p><p></p><p>However, the absolute loyalty of the bodyguards could save him from a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>The other forces that had joined him, even those from the Shenwu Sect, might not be able to trust him completely.</p><p></p><p>After all, the world ultimately values interests.</p><p></p><p>So-called loyalty is just a lack of sufficient reasons for betrayal.</p><p></p><p>Like the bodyguards, there was no need to worry about such issues.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the constantly updating text on the information panel, Gu Qingfeng could see how intense the war in Nanyang Prefecture was.</p><p></p><p>The aura of bloodshed was already palpable.</p><p></p><p>However, despite the intensity, from the current situation, Gu Yang was in a dominant position.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, it would not take long for him to completely subdue the entire Nanyang Prefecture.

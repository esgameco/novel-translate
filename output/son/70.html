        <h1>Chapter 70</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin's expression remained unchanged as he looked into the Gu Family Manor, where there was a barely perceptible aura of surging blood and qi.</p><p></p><p>This was a mutual resonance that only the strong could sense.</p><p></p><p>"This person is indeed extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid even cultivators at the Xisui realm may not possess such a powerful aura!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin's heart grew slightly heavy.</p><p></p><p>Before arriving, he had not taken Gu Qingfeng seriously, even though the latter had slain the Elder Blue Yang. After all, the Elder Blue Yang's strength was not too formidable, at least in the eyes of the Zhenxie Mansion.</p><p></p><p>But now, Jiang Qin understood.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's strength was indeed not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Such a robust aura could not be possessed by an ordinary cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Jiang Qin believed that his arrival had also been detected by the other party.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, not long after Jiang Qin's thoughts, the doors of the Gu Family Manor opened, and Gu Peng came out, politely saying, "I am Gu Peng, the current Acting Pavilion Master of the Gu Family Manor. I have been instructed by the Manor Lord to invite the esteemed guest to come inside and have a seat."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Jiang Qin casually glanced at Gu Peng and nodded slightly, following him inside.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator at the Blood Refining Initiate realm.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, they were like ants.</p><p></p><p>Only the Gu Family Manor Lord himself could command Jiang Qin's attention.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the main hall, Jiang Qin saw a middle-aged man sitting at the head. Their eyes met, and the air seemed to grow slightly more tense.</p><p></p><p>"Manor Lord, I have brought the guest," Gu Peng said, breaking the silence.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng waved his hand. "You may leave."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng retreated.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, Gu Qingfeng looked at Jiang Qin again and smiled slightly. "Sir, may I ask where you have come from, and what brings you to our Gu Family Manor today?"</p><p></p><p>"I am Jiang Qin, the Deputy Commander of the Zhenxie Mansion in Guangyang Prefecture. I have heard that you, Manor Lord, have slain the Elder Blue Yang and destroyed the Blue Yang Sect, so I have come to invite you to join our Zhenxie Mansion!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin spoke directly, without any intention of hiding anything. After all, the existence of the Zhenxie Mansion was well-known to many factions.</p><p></p><p>This identity gave Jiang Qin sufficient confidence.</p><p></p><p>"The Zhenxie Mansion!" Gu Qingfeng's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He had considered many possibilities, but he had not expected the people from the Zhenxie Mansion to come in person.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin stood with his hands behind his back, his expression slightly aloof. "The Zhenxie Mansion is a force under the court's jurisdiction, and there are many powerful cultivators and skilled practitioners within. Even cultivators who have not yet reached the Yuling realm, like the Elder Blue Yang, are not uncommon in the Zhenxie Mansion."</p><p></p><p>"You should know that the path of the Dao is difficult. Even if one has reached the Grandmaster realm, they are still insignificant in the face of truly powerful practitioners. The Zhenxie Mansion has its own secret techniques for refining demonic energy, and if Manor Lord is willing to join the Zhenxie Mansion and make contributions, it is not impossible for you to be granted access to these secret techniques in the future."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Jiang Qin casually found an empty seat and sat down, waiting for Gu Qingfeng's response.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, the other party had no reason to refuse.</p><p></p><p>Not only was the Zhenxie Mansion an organization under the court's jurisdiction, but joining it would also grant a certain status that ordinary sects could not match.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, there was the secret technique for refining demonic energy.</p><p></p><p>No one did not desire immortality.</p><p></p><p>Although those who refined demonic energy could not truly achieve immortality, they could at least...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Cultivators can live far longer than ordinary martial artists.</p><p></p><p>This alone is something that others cannot refuse.</p><p></p><p>"There is a matter that I, Gu, would like to ask Commander Jiang about!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not directly agree or refuse, but instead changed the topic.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Commander Jiang said that the martial dao is difficult to achieve, does that mean that the masters of the jianghu are the true limit, and that there are no stronger ones who can break through the barrier of mastery and reach an even higher level?"</p><p></p><p>"For ordinary martial artists, the master level is indeed the limit. In fact, many martial artists cannot even reach the level of refining their essence and purifying their bodies, let alone the master level.</p><p></p><p>However, I observe that you, Lord Gu, have a robust vital energy. Even if you have not reached the level of refining your body, you are likely not far off.</p><p></p><p>If you live long enough, you may have a chance to attain the master level!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin paused here.</p><p></p><p>"As for whether there are higher levels beyond the master, there have indeed been some exceptional individuals throughout history who, due to various fortuitous circumstances, have broken through the barrier of mastery and reached the grand master level.</p><p></p><p>It is rumored that a grand master's vital energy is like a great sun furnace, their strength far surpassing that of a mere master, to the point of being able to tear apart forbidden areas with their bare hands and live for eight hundred years!"</p><p></p><p>"But this level exists only in legends. Among the multitude of martial artists in the world, it is difficult for even one grand master to emerge in a century."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, even if one becomes a grand master, they will still turn to dust after eight hundred years. The only true path is to refine evil and embody the ways of the sorcerer."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin's words were telling the other that the martial dao ultimately has its limits, and even achieving the master or grand master level is nothing more than that.</p><p></p><p>The true path lies in aligning with the Exorcism Bureau and obtaining the method of refining evil within one's body.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng was now digesting Jiang Qin's words.</p><p></p><p>Grand master! Forbidden areas!</p><p></p><p>From the other's words, he had learned about many things he had never heard of before.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask what is meant by 'forbidden areas'?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng asked again.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin was somewhat impatient, but still provided an answer.</p><p></p><p>"Forbidden areas are places where calamitous evil entities have coalesced. Within these forbidden areas, the evil entities are virtually invincible.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, once a forbidden area is sealed, living beings can hardly enter or exit.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, whenever a forbidden area appears, it signifies the annihilation of the living beings in that area. It is precisely for this reason that such existences are given the name 'forbidden areas'."</p><p></p><p>I see!</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression became enlightened.</p><p></p><p>This is what is known as a forbidden area.</p><p></p><p>Calamitous evil entities.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Gu Qingfeng had an idea and took out the black powder he had previously obtained, using his vital energy to control the jade box containing the powder and placing it in front of Jiang Qin.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask Commander Jiang if he can identify this substance?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin's gaze fell on the black powder, and the icy aura emanating from it caused his expression to change slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I have underestimated you. I didn't expect you to have slain a bizarre entity!"</p><p></p><p>"Bizarre entity?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's face was filled with confusion.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin said, "In the world, evil entities are almost indestructible, and ordinary people find it difficult to slay them. Only evil entities can have the possibility of slaying and consuming other evil entities."</p><p></p><p>"And in the era when evil entities were rampant, the accumulated resentment of all living beings eventually gave birth to another kind of existence."</p><p></p><p>"This existence is called a 'bizarre entity'."</p><p></p><p>"Bizarre entities are not as difficult to deal with as evil entities, but they can influence the mind and spirit of martial artists, causing them to unknowingly succumb to it. Many strong individuals have accidentally fallen into its trap."</p><p></p><p>"By the time they realize it, their vital energy has already been completely drained by the bizarre entity, and they can only regret their demise."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

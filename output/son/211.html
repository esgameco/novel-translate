        <h1>Chapter 211</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has led the army to the Central Plains, and the great army has swept away all resistance, with few able to withstand him!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has led the army to Lingzhou, and the great army has swept away all resistance, with few able to withstand him!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by a Grandmaster-level cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Shengxing' has been subjected to a mysterious attack, but fortunately he was protected by the essence blood of a powerful expert and remained unharmed!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Sheng'an' has been subjected to a mysterious attack, but fortunately he was protected by the essence blood of a powerful expert and remained unharmed!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain a Grandmaster-level expert by breaking through his level!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has led his army to conquer nine cities in three days, with a grand momentum!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has received guidance from a Great Grandmaster, and his cultivation has improved slightly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has unexpectedly obtained the legacy of a mysterious powerful expert, and his strength has increased slightly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has consumed an ancient elixir, and his cultivation has increased significantly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has comprehended the true meaning of the Heavenly Saber, and his strength has increased slightly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has comprehended the manual of a Grandmaster, and his strength has increased slightly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Shengnan' has received guidance from a Grandmaster-level expert, and her cultivation has improved slightly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sat calmly in the Gu Family Manor, able to control the situation throughout the world.</p><p></p><p>When he saw that Gu Yang was simultaneously attacking the Central Plains and Lingzhou, he did not find it surprising.</p><p></p><p>Now, having conquered the Ling King's army, Gu Yang's forces have grown significantly.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Central Plains and Lingzhou:</p><p></p><p>The former had just experienced turmoil, and its foundation and strength had fallen to the lowest point, with various local warlords perishing, and some local sects and aristocratic families unable to obstruct the path of Guangyang's army.</p><p></p><p>As for Lingzhou, there was even less to say.</p><p></p><p>Fu Zhao had perished.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Profound Master had also fallen at Tian Xiong Pass.</p><p></p><p>As the only immortal sect in Lingzhou, the Taixuan Sect was the greatest obstacle for Guangyang's army, but now the two top experts had fallen, it was like a toothless tiger.</p><p></p><p>In this case, how much threat could the Taixuan Sect still pose?</p><p></p><p>On Gu Yang's side, there was a Grand Dao Grandmaster personally stationed, and there were also many Grandmaster-level experts. Dealing with the half-crippled Taixuan Sect would not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>However, when Gu Qingfeng learned that his two grandsons had been subjected to mysterious attacks, his gaze turned cold.</p><p></p><p>Mysterious attacks. </p><p></p><p>Clearly, this could not have happened without reason. </p><p></p><p>It meant that there were powerful experts manipulating the mysteries to cause this.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had left a drop of his essence blood for the two of them earlier, precisely to prevent this problem.</p><p></p><p>After all, the times were different now.</p><p></p><p>The larger Gu Yang's forces became, the more he would inevitably touch the interests of others.</p><p></p><p>If they could not deal with Gu Yang, they would target the people around him.</p><p></p><p>As for the Gu Family Manor, even if these people had ten times the courage, they would not dare to extend their hands there, but the Wang Family might be a different story.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng summoned one of the shadow guards and said, "I have heard that my two grandsons have been subjected to mysterious attacks. I want the shadow guards to investigate and find out who is behind this and which force they belong to."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!" </p><p></p><p>The shadow guard immediately accepted the order and left.</p><p></p><p>After the shadow guard left, Gu Qingfeng continued to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>The Refining Blood True Classic was only one step away from perfection, and most of his time was spent on this.</p><p></p><p>As for the Heavenly Vein True Classic and the Heavenly Saber Realm, which were his greatest trump cards, Gu Qingfeng had not spent too much time on them for the time being.</p><p></p><p>There was no choice.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Vein True Classic, a profoundly mysterious cultivation method, was completely incomparable to the so-called Grandmaster martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Even with Gu Qingfeng's current vision, he still found the Heavenly Vein True Classic to be extremely abstruse and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>To condense the third Heavenly Vein was not something that could be accomplished overnight.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if he could successfully condense the third Heavenly Vein, Gu Qingfeng's strength would also surge dramatically.</p><p></p><p>After all, the cultivation of a single Heavenly Vein could increase one's strength by a fold, which was not something that ordinary realm breakthroughs could compare to.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng believed that the reason he currently found the cultivation of the Heavenly Vein True Classic so difficult was due to his insufficient realm. If his cultivation advanced further, perhaps cultivating the Heavenly Vein True Classic would become much easier.</p><p></p><p>As for the Heavenly Saber Realm, it was the same.</p><p></p><p>This supreme technique had already broken through the Grandmaster's bottleneck and entered a higher realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, to break through the Heavenly Saber Realm was also not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>What Gu Qingfeng needed to do now was to first raise the Refining Blood True Classic to a higher level.</p><p></p><p>In the Guangyang Palace.</p><p></p><p>The internal defenses were now on full alert.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's face was ice-cold, and the killing intent in his eyes was almost tangible.</p><p></p><p>"Investigate! Thoroughly search!"</p><p></p><p>"I want to know who dares to manipulate the mysteries and attempt to assassinate the Crown Prince!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this icy-cold voice, the commander of the palace guards trembled as he accepted the order.</p><p></p><p>"I will get right on it!"</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, from today onwards, the palace will be on full alert. If such an incident occurs again, you, the commander of the palace guards, will no longer have this position."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said coldly.</p><p></p><p>This time, he was truly enraged.</p><p></p><p>Even though there had been previous attempts by powerful experts to assassinate him, Gu Yang had never been so furious.</p><p></p><p>But this time, someone had attacked his son, which had completely touched Gu Yang's taboo.</p><p></p><p>At a critical moment, if it were not for the drop of essence blood left behind by his father, which was capable of suppressing the mysterious forces, the consequences would have been unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>After the palace guard commander left, Gu Yang summoned one of the shadow guards.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have any news?"</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the shadow guards have not yet been able to uncover the true identity of the one manipulating the mysterious forces, but we do have some clues."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi respectfully reported.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at him, his expression still icy-cold.</p><p></p><p>"Who?"</p><p></p><p>"The Wanmeng Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi said truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Gu Yang to ask further, he continued.</p><p></p><p>"The Wanmeng Sect is a mysterious sect in Lingzhou, rumored to have some connection with the Taixuan Sect. The Wanmeng Sect possesses some mysterious techniques for manipulating the supernatural, and their reputation in the jianghu is quite renowned.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Guangyang Army has entered Lingzhou, they have inevitably touched the interests of the Wanmeng Sect, and their retaliation in the shadows is understandable.</p><p></p><p>Of course, such techniques for manipulating the supernatural are not exclusive to the Wanmeng Sect. Some wandering cultivators in the jianghu also possess such methods.</p><p></p><p>Without concrete evidence, it is difficult to definitively say that this is the work of the Wanmeng Sect."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Yang immediately let out a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>"The King does not need evidence to act. Since the Wanmeng Sect possesses the ability to manipulate the supernatural, then I will strike at the Wanmeng Sect first. I want you to investigate the full strength of the Wanmeng Sect within three days."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi bowed and accepted the order, then left.</p><p></p><p>After he left, the killing intent in Gu Yang's eyes remained fierce.</p><p></p><p>"Wanmeng Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"I will let the entire world know the consequences of opposing me!"</p><p></p><p>The weak must rely on evidence to act, but the strong can act as evidence itself.</p><p></p><p>Now that someone had touched his taboo, Gu Yang would not tolerate it.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Wanmeng Sect had a connection with the Taixuan Sect, and it would inevitably become a future problem. He might as well use this opportunity to eradicate the Wanmeng Sect.</p><p></p><p>Within three days, Gu Yi had delivered all the intelligence about the Wanmeng Sect to Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>"The Wanmeng Sect has a history of over 5,600 years, and there are nine Fusion Realm experts guarding the sect. The Wanmeng Sect's Patriarch, the Venerable Wanmeng, is rumored to be at the Half-step Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>He possesses the precious treasure, the Wanmeng Banner, which is said to be an item capable of refining the supernatural, and it is extremely formidable!"</p><p></p><p>Nine Fusion Realm experts! The precious Wanmeng Banner! Gu Yang's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>From this, one could see that the foundation of the Wanmeng Sect was indeed not weak.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Gu Yang might not have been able to deal with the Wanmeng Sect, but the situation was different now.</p><p></p><p>"Relay my order: have Shi Zhen lead the Tiangao Army to exterminate the Wanmeng Sect, and also have Senior Sword accompany the army. In this battle, I want the Wanmeng Sect to be wiped out!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang directly issued the order.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful the Wanmeng Sect was, with 36,000 Tiangao Army and the presence of a Dao Grandmaster, not only one Wanmeng Sect, even two or three Wanmeng Sects could be easily annihilated.</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving this order, Gu Yi immediately accepted it and left.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in Lingzhou, in the main hall of the Wanmeng Sect, there was a blood-robed elder sitting in the high position. His sunken cheeks, prominent cheekbones, and deep, sharp eyes gave people a chilling feeling. This person was the Wanmeng Sect Patriarch, the Venerable Wanmeng.</p><p></p><p>In front of him stood a Wanmeng Sect Elder, standing with the utmost respect.</p><p></p><p>"You're saying you failed?"</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Wanmeng looked at the person below, his gaze indifferent, his hoarse voice making people feel uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Xu Lin hurriedly said, "Your subordinate did not expect that those two young children would have mysterious protective methods, and I momentarily overlooked this, for which I beg the Patriarch's forgiveness!"</p><p></p><p>"I remember you have a Floating Stupa-level supernatural being. How could you have failed even with that?"</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Wanmeng frowned.</p><p></p><p>The Floating Stupa-level supernatural being was at the Grandmaster and True Meaning Grandmaster level.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Lin's supernatural being was only at the initial Floating Stupa level, which was considered a general Grandmaster, the supernatural beings were often more powerful in terms of assassination and sneak attacks than ordinary Grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>That Gu Yang had powerful experts guarding him, so Xu Lin's failure was understandable.</p><p></p><p>But now, even failing to deal with two young children, this had made the Venerable Wanmeng feel dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>Xu Lin bitterly smiled, "That pair had an extremely unyielding and yang-dominant force. As soon as my Floating Stupa-level supernatural being approached them, it was burned to death by that blood energy force."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Xu Lin's eyes also revealed a hint of fear, as if he had encountered something terrifying.</p><p></p><p>This statement once again made the Venerable Wanmeng's brows furrow.</p><p></p><p>A Floating Stupa-level supernatural being, which already involved the Grandmaster realm, had its strength not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>If it was a top expert that appeared, then slaying a Floating Stupa-level supernatural being would be understandable.</p><p></p><p>But now, according to Xu Lin's description, the two children possessed a mysterious force that could directly annihilate a Floating Stupa-level supernatural being just by approaching it. This was quite unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Martial Saint's doing?"</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Wanmeng thought of Gu Qingfeng, and his expression became even more grave.</p><p></p><p>Regarding that expert who could slay Fu Zhao, the Venerable Wanmeng was naturally very wary.</p><p></p><p>It was not that the Wanmeng Sect's foundation was not strong, but in the face of such a powerful expert, they could be easily destroyed with a wave of the hand.</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, the Venerable Wanmeng looked at Xu Lin and said in a deep voice, "You did not expose your identity, did you?"</p><p></p><p>"Your subordinate has been discreet, only letting the supernatural being act. I believe no one will have any suspicions."</p><p></p><p>Xu Lin said confidently.</p><p></p><p>Throughout, he had not personally taken action, only letting the supernatural being handle it. Now that the supernatural being had perished, there was no evidence to implicate him.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Wanmeng nodded slightly after hearing this, and then directly summoned an ancient black banner.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When the black spirit banner appeared, Xu Lin's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Souls Banner..."</p><p></p><p>However, before he could react, the Patriarch of Myriad Souls unleashed a palm strike, directly shattering Xu Lin's body. Immediately, the black mist from the Myriad Souls Banner swarmed out, with bizarre entities emerging to tear Xu Lin's corpse to shreds.</p><p></p><p>It was over in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Only a few traces of blood remained on the ground.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Lin's whereabouts, they had already vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"Don't blame the Patriarch for being ruthless, but this matter cannot be allowed to leak out. Your death will ensure the continuation of the sect, and I believe you won't refuse!"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of Myriad Souls muttered to himself, his gaze extremely cold and merciless.</p><p></p><p>From the moment Xu Lin made his move, his fate had already been sealed. Regardless of whether he succeeded or not, he had to be silenced afterwards. After all, if this matter were to be exposed, it would plunge the Myriad Souls Sect into an irreversible abyss. Only by eliminating him could the secret be kept.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a disciple of the Myriad Souls Sect hurriedly arrived.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the blood on the ground, the disciple's expression changed, and he respectfully reported, "Patriarch, someone from the Gu Family Village has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>"What?!"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of Myriad Souls' previously calm demeanor immediately changed upon hearing these words. The Gu Family Village has sent someone! Even with his resolute nature, he couldn't help but feel a sense of panic.</p><p></p><p>However, the Patriarch soon regained his composure and asked calmly, "Who has come?"</p><p></p><p>"The outer hall master of the Gu Family Village, Gu Peng!"</p><p></p><p>"Gu Peng... Have him wait in the front hall."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the front hall of the Myriad Souls Sect, Gu Peng sat imposingly, with Myriad Souls disciples respectfully attending to him, their expressions filled with awe.</p><p></p><p>When the Patriarch of Myriad Souls arrived, his gaze towards Gu Peng slightly changed, but he quickly resumed his normal demeanor.</p><p></p><p>"I've long heard of the fame of the Hall Master Gu. Now that I've met you in person, you indeed live up to your reputation!"</p><p></p><p>"So you are the Patriarch of Myriad Souls?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng raised his brow slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of Myriad Souls smiled slightly. "That's right. May I ask what brings the Hall Master here today?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Patriarch of Myriad Souls adopted an extremely humble posture.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng glanced at him and spoke in an indifferent tone, "Not long ago, the Crown Prince of Guangyang was attacked. I wonder if you have heard about this?"</p><p></p><p>"Such an event has occurred?" The Patriarch of Myriad Souls expressed surprise and shook his head. "I have been residing in Lingzhou for a long time and have not heard of this."</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng looked at him deeply and said, "I've heard that the perpetrator possessed the ability to manipulate bizarre techniques, and it is said that the Myriad Souls Sect also has knowledge of such arts. I wonder if there is any connection between the Myriad Souls Sect and this incident?"</p><p></p><p>"Hall Master Gu, you jest. The ability to manipulate bizarre techniques is not exclusive to the Myriad Souls Sect alone. We would never dare to take responsibility for the crime of assassinating the Crown Prince."</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of Myriad Souls spoke calmly. He knew that Gu Peng had come to accuse them, but since the culprit, Xu Lin, had already been eliminated, the Patriarch was not worried about the matter being exposed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Patriarch's denial, Gu Peng's gaze turned cold. "So you dare to do it but not take responsibility?"</p><p></p><p>"Hall Master Gu, in such matters, evidence is required. If you claim that this is the doing of our Myriad Souls Sect, then do you have any proof?"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of Myriad Souls' expression also became somewhat displeased, and his gaze towards Gu Peng grew colder.</p><p></p><p>"If there is evidence proving that this is the work of our Myriad Souls Sect, then the Guangyang King can punish us as he sees fit. But if there is no evidence, and you are simply making false accusations, then I cannot accept this!"</p><p></p><p>"The Guangyang King has been ruling Qingyun State with benevolence, and his mighty army is poised to become the supreme ruler of the Nine Provinces. I respect him greatly for this. An act like assassinating the Crown Prince is something we would never do."</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of Myriad Souls then changed the subject, smiling faintly.</p><p></p><p>He was not afraid of Gu Peng's accusations, as there was no evidence. No matter how much the other party insisted, it would be futile.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Patriarch's response, Gu Peng looked at him deeply and then stood up, saying, "Since this matter is not the doing of the Myriad Souls Sect, then I shall take my leave."</p><p></p><p>"Hall Master Gu, safe travels!"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of Myriad Souls smiled slightly and had someone see Gu Peng off.</p><p></p><p>After Gu Peng's figure completely disappeared, the Patriarch's smile gradually faded, and his gaze turned icy cold.</p><p></p><p>"A mere sect master dares to come here and accuse us. If not for the fact that you are from the Gu Family Village, I would have ensured you could never return!"</p><p></p><p>As he said this, a bloodthirsty gleam flashed in the Patriarch's eyes.</p><p></p><p>A sect master-level cultivator! With his robust spiritual energy, devouring and refining him could save decades of arduous cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But for this matter, the Patriarch of Myriad Souls could only think about it in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Killing Gu Peng would be easy. A mere sect master could not stir up any waves in the Myriad Souls Sect.</p><p></p><p>However, the Gu Family Village behind Gu Peng was not something the Myriad Souls Sect could afford to provoke.</p><p></p><p>This was different from the previous incident. The previous matter was done by Xu Lin, and his actions were secretive. Even the Guangyang King could not find any evidence.</p><p></p><p>But now, Gu Peng had openly entered the Myriad Souls Sect. If any problems were to arise, the Myriad Souls Sect would be unable to escape involvement.</p><p></p><p>Silencing him was the only way to ensure the secret did not leak out.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Gu Peng left the Myriad Souls Sect. He turned and looked at the towering mountains before him, his gaze growing cold. In the next instant, he drew the long sword on his back and swung it towards the Myriad Souls Sect.</p><p></p><p>A single strike.</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth shattered!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying power tore through the void and sky, slamming into the mountain gate of the Myriad Souls Sect.</p><p></p><p>This mountain peak, which had stood for countless years, was completely shattered under this single strike.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The mountain collapsed.</p><p></p><p>The sect was annihilated.</p><p></p><p>Many Myriad Souls Sect disciples and elders did not even have time to react before being reduced to dust by the overwhelming power.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a terrifying aura erupted from within the Myriad Souls Sect, and a voice filled with towering rage shook the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to attack my Myriad Souls Sect?!"</p><p></p><p>As the voice faded, the bloodied figure of the Patriarch of Myriad Souls appeared in the air.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Souls Sect master was in a pitiful state. His robes were stained with blood, and his left arm was severed at the root, as if cut by a sharp blade. Copious amounts of blood flowed from the wound.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the ruins of the Myriad Souls Sect and the fallen disciples, the Patriarch's eyes turned blood-red.</p><p></p><p>Then, he looked towards the outside of the mountain gate, meeting Gu Peng's cold gaze.</p><p></p><p>"It's you!"</p><p></p><p>"Why have you destroyed my Myriad Souls Sect?!"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of Myriad Souls was enraged.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng spoke coldly, "The assassination of the Crown Prince is a capital offense. I have been ordered by the Patriarch to exterminate the Myriad Souls Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"What evidence do you have?!"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch's expression was ferocious.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng said, "The Patriarch's words are the evidence!"</p><p></p><p>With that, the Exorcism Sword struck again.</p><p></p><p>The towering sword qi slashed through the heavens and the universe, locking the Patriarch of Myriad Souls in its terrifying power. The Patriarch was filled with dread, his face expressing fear as he sensed the approach of death.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to kill me, let Gu Qingfeng come himself. You don't have the ability to do so—"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the Patriarch of Myriad Souls activated the Myriad Souls Banner, and a horrifying, bizarre entity suddenly appeared, with towering black mist obscuring the sky, like a demonic god descending.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Souls Banner was the supreme treasure of the Myriad Souls Sect, refined by the powerful cultivators of the sect over thousands of years. It had fallen into the Patriarch's hands, and he had used it to slay countless beings, further enhancing its power.</p><p></p><p>Now, as it was unleashed, its might was truly awe-inspiring.</p><p></p><p>"Within my Myriad Souls Banner, there are eighty-eight thousand bizarre entities, eighteen Arhat-level bizarre entities, and even a half-Yama-level bizarre entity. Even a Nascent Soul cultivator would not dare to face it.</p><p></p><p>Today, I shall devour you and empower my Myriad Souls Banner!"</p><p></p><p>Since the mask had been torn off, the Patriarch of Myriad Souls no longer had anything to fear. He activated the Myriad Souls Banner, and countless bizarre entities frantically surged towards Gu Peng, intent on overwhelming him.</p><p></p><p>But in the next instant, the towering sword qi descended.</p><p></p><p>All the bizarre entities, like snow melting in the spring sun, let out agonizing screams and disintegrated.</p><p></p><p>The eighty-eight thousand bizarre entities, the eighteen Arhat-level bizarre entities—all of them were annihilated before this single strike.</p><p></p><p>Only the half-Yama-level bizarre entity remained, desperately trying to block the all-encompassing sword qi. However, in the face of such absolute power, any struggle was futile.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, the half-Yama-level bizarre entity let out a piercing scream and was slain on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the residual power of the sword strike slammed into the Patriarch of Myriad Souls' body, causing his flesh to explode, and he perished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The rocks shattered.</p><p></p><p>The mountain gate was obliterated.</p><p></p><p>The already crumbling Myriad Souls Sect was further reduced to ruins, and the remaining disciples and elders who had barely clung to life were all killed instantly.</p><p></p><p>Witnessing the complete destruction of the Myriad Souls Sect, Gu Peng's chest heaved, and he was visibly shaken.</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch's might!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng was well aware of the power of the Exorcism Sword, but actually using it to wipe out the Myriad Souls Sect in two strikes was far more shocking than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Myriad Souls Sect was a top-tier sect in Lingzhou, not as unparalleled as the Taisu Sect, but still an extraordinary one, with powerful cultivators within.</p><p></p><p>Yet, this mighty sect had been annihilated by the Exorcism Sword in just two strikes.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng understood that the destruction of the Myriad Souls Sect was not due to his own strength, but rather the awe-inspiring power of the Exorcism Sword.</p><p></p><p>Sect masters, half-Nascent Soul cultivators—in the face of such power, they were nothing but jokes.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng looked at the ruins of the Myriad Souls Sect, then took the Myriad Souls Banner left behind by the Patriarch, and turned to leave.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 36</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I'll give you one more chance!" </p><p></p><p>"Now swear allegiance to my Gu family, or else everyone present here today will die--"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's tiger-like eyes emanated a powerful aura of a half-step Refined Bone Realm cultivator, causing the expressions of everyone present to change repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, </p><p></p><p>someone took the lead and knelt down, saying in a fawning tone, "I have long heard of the Gu family's esteemed reputation, and it is an honor for me to serve the Gu family!"</p><p></p><p>One person knelt down.</p><p></p><p>Very soon, a second person, a third person bowed their heads in submission.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Changkong had died, what could they use to fight against Gu Qingfeng?</p><p></p><p>Even if the people present rushed up together, they might not be able to kill the other party. But how much price would their own side have to pay?</p><p></p><p>No one could guarantee that they would not become one of the many sacrifices. If they fell here, they would be making a shroud for others.</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's strength was unfathomable, and it was impossible to see the limit of his power. They were afraid that even if everyone attacked together, it would not be enough to kill him.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Qingfeng showed signs of fatigue, perhaps someone would make a move.</p><p></p><p>But now,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had ruthlessly killed Cloud Tianxing and Cloud Changkong, completely shattering the will of these people.</p><p></p><p>Submission!</p><p></p><p>Was the only way.</p><p></p><p>If they did not submit, they would die.</p><p></p><p>No one would doubt whether Gu Qingfeng would ruthlessly kill, as he had the Iron Bone Gang and the Qin family behind him, which showed how ruthless his methods were.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the people submitting, and the disciples and elders of the Tianyun Sect daring not to speak out,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have submitted to me, then show enough sincerity and destroy the Tianyun Sect, that will be your pledge of allegiance!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken,</p><p></p><p>many people were stunned.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Tianyun Sect also had their faces change drastically.</p><p></p><p>An elder angrily shouted, "Gu Qingfeng, do you really want to eliminate them completely--"</p><p></p><p>Before the elder could finish his words, he felt a sharp pain in his chest, and when he looked down, a gleaming bloody sword tip appeared in his line of sight.</p><p></p><p>Pu ci!</p><p></p><p>The long sword was withdrawn from his back.</p><p></p><p>This Tianyun Sect elder fell down, his face full of resentment.</p><p></p><p>The one who struck was the first to kneel and submit, the Crimson Sword Gate Master Shangguan Rong.</p><p></p><p>As a mid-stage Blood Refining cultivator, he suddenly attacked by surprise, and the Tianyun Sect elder had no chance of resisting.</p><p></p><p>Killing the other party with a single sword, Shangguan Rong's expression was cold and ruthless, his gaze towards the remaining Tianyun Sect warriors filled with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianyun Sect has vicious ambitions, wanting to incite the various forces of the rivers and lakes to harm the Gu family. I, the Crimson Sword Gate, will not agree to this. Today, I will destroy the Tianyun Sect to vent my anger for the Gu family--"</p><p></p><p>As Shangguan Rong's words fell, his figure was like a ghost, his cold sword breaking the air, and in an instant, he had killed many Tianyun Sect warriors.</p><p></p><p>This scene left the others stunned, obviously not expecting Shangguan Rong to be so shameless, to turn traitor so decisively.</p><p></p><p>But soon,</p><p></p><p>the others, upon seeing Gu Qingfeng's indifferent gaze, also suddenly reacted, hurriedly rushing towards the other Tianyun Sect members.</p><p></p><p>In an instant,</p><p></p><p>the Tianyun Sect members were filled with shock and anger.</p><p></p><p>The various forces that were supposed to be invited to jointly fight against Gu Qingfeng had now become the death knell for the Tianyun Sect.</p><p></p><p>Without Cloud Tianxing and Cloud Changkong to lead them, the Tianyun Sect simply did not have the strength to resist the various forces.</p><p></p><p>In less than a moment,</p><p></p><p>the entire Tianyun Sect was massacred.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Rong, his sword stained with blood, came before Gu Qingfeng, his face fawning: "Lord Gu, the Tianyun Sect has been destroyed!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, you have done well in this matter," Gu Qingfeng said with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Correct," Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly. The Shangguan Rong before him may appear to be a spineless character, a mere opportunist, but Gu Qingfeng did not mind this at all.</p><p></p><p>Opportunists are fine, as long as they can be used.</p><p></p><p>With such people working for him, it would be much easier for the Gu family to conquer the entire Baishi Dao.</p><p></p><p>As for whether the Chijian Gate would betray him in the future, this was not something Gu Qingfeng was concerned about.</p><p></p><p>If the Chijian Gate were to betray him, he would simply eliminate them.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng said, "You take people and gather all the resources of the Tianyun Sect, then send them all to the Gu family."</p><p></p><p>"No problem, the Chijian Gate will definitely handle this well!" Shangguan Rong thumped his chest and promised, completely unconcerned about the disdainful gazes of the others.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, face was something completely worthless.</p><p></p><p>The strength Gu Qingfeng had displayed was more than enough to demonstrate the other's power, and more importantly, he was still quite young. Judging from his appearance, he was no more than thirty years old.</p><p></p><p>At this age, he had already reached the threshold of the Refine Bone realm, and in the future, as long as there were no problems, breaking through the Refine Blood realm's limit and advancing to the Refine Bone realm would be a certainty. </p><p></p><p>Even surpassing the Refine Bone realm was not impossible.</p><p></p><p>Staying by the side of such a powerful figure, there was only benefit and no harm for the Chijian Gate.</p><p></p><p>"Those who know the times are the wise ones," this was Shangguan Rong's creed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng left. He did not linger long at the Tianyun Sect. But not long after his departure, the news of the Tianyun Sect's destruction also spread.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the jianghu was in an uproar. Previously, the Qin family of the Iron Bone Gang had been destroyed, and now the Tianyun Sect had also met the same fate. The three forces in the Baishi Dao that had cultivators at the peak of the Refine Blood realm had all been annihilated by the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the submission of the Chijian Gate and other forces, the Gu family had already quietly risen to the level of a hegemon in the Baishi Dao.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Shangguan Rong sent all the inventory of the Tianyun Sect's resources to the Gu family, intact.</p><p></p><p>After that, Gu Qingfeng began to extensively recruit warriors and establish the Gu family's guards. The response was endless. In less than half a month, there were more than three hundred people who had joined the Gu family, and the weakest among them were at the middle stage of the Refine Skin realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the initial stage of the Refine Skin realm, they did not even have the qualifications to join the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there were even a few cultivators at the Refine Blood realm who had joined the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>In the past, cultivators at the Refine Blood realm had a high status in the jianghu, either establishing their own forces or living as free spirits, rarely joining other factions. </p><p></p><p>But now it was different. With the Gu family's dominance over the Baishi Dao, they had become the hegemon in just a few years. Gu Qingfeng's cultivation was also unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>In the current chaotic times, being able to join a powerful faction was the key to securing one's future, so the Gu family had become the object of many warriors' desires.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Gu family provided extremely generous treatment. This was because after annihilating the top factions like the Qin family, and with other forces submitting, the Gu family's resources had rapidly and greatly increased in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>In the following period, the Gu family's warriors swept across the entire Baishi Dao. All dissenting voices were completely suppressed in the face of their absolute power.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

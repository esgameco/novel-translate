        <h1>Chapter 101</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not need to hesitate.</p><p></p><p>The twenty advancement points had disappeared, replaced by a silent and stealthy breakthrough to the third realm of the Five Viscera Cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The refinement of the viscera.</p><p>The abundance of qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng felt the transformative power within his body. His eyes shone with a bright light, and a powerful aura emanated from him, causing the divine weapons in the Whetstone Hall to tremble, as if affected by some force.</p><p></p><p>"Viscera Refinement, Third Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>Viscera Refinement, Third Realm.</p><p>His strength had advanced further.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, each step in Viscera Refinement is a realm unto itself. The successful refinement of each viscera can bring about a powerful transformation in one's abilities.</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know how much difference there is between my current strength and that of a true Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>A Patriarch is an existence who has perfected their Five Viscera and then broken through their own limits.</p><p></p><p>For an ordinary Viscera Refinement Third Realm cultivator, they would naturally lack the confidence to contend with a Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p>Gu Qingfeng had already grasped the true essence of the Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>If it were an ordinary Patriarch who had not comprehended the true essence, Gu Qingfeng's Viscera Refinement Third Realm cultivation might still be able to match them in battle.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p>Gu Qingfeng was only thinking about it for now.</p><p></p><p>True Patriarch experts are limited in number in the world.</p><p>He could not simply go and challenge a Patriarch without reason.</p><p></p><p>But one thing was certain.</p><p>Gu Qingfeng was confident that his current strength was still vastly inferior to the Demonic Buddha in the Nine Turns Path.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Turns Path had already become a complete dead zone, with evil spirits running rampant, to the point that even the Exorcism Bureau could not subdue that Demonic Buddha.</p><p></p><p>In Guangyang Prefecture, people would shudder at the mere mention of the Nine Turns Path. Both commoners and martial artists alike kept their distance, fearing that they would become prey to the Demonic Buddha if they entered.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that the Nine Turns Path had now become a paradise for evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>Although the Demonic Buddha had not made many moves so far, Gu Qingfeng was certain that it would not be content to remain in the Nine Turns Path forever.</p><p></p><p>So, one day.</p><p>The Demonic Buddha will emerge from the Nine Turns Path.</p><p></p><p>When that time comes.</p><p>The consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had to cultivate his strength to a sufficient level before the Demonic Buddha left the Nine Turns Path.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>This year, Gu Qingfeng was thirty-nine years old.</p><p>His cultivation had reached the Viscera Refinement Third Realm.</p><p></p><p>For an ordinary person, to break through to the Viscera Refinement Third Realm at this age would mean they had a high chance of eventually reaching the Patriarch realm, barring any unexpected incidents.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng did not become complacent with his breakthrough. Instead, he focused on cultivating the Chaos Jade Mirror, successfully advancing it to the third realm within the first month.</p><p></p><p>At this point, both of his Viscera Refinement martial arts had reached the limits of their current realms.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Gu Qingfeng truly begin to comprehend the Scarlet Flame Divine Skill.</p><p></p><p>The reason he had not cultivated the Scarlet Flame Divine Skill earlier was that he had been focused on cultivating the Azure Yang Technique and the Five Viscera Cultivation, and could not afford to divide his attention too much.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Azure Yang Technique had been perfected, with his eight-level pure Yang qi and blood, his physical body and strength were comparable to the blazing sun, reaching an extremely robust level.</p><p></p><p>Going forward, Gu Qingfeng would naturally turn his attention to cultivating the Scarlet Flame Divine Skill.</p><p></p><p>As the supreme secret art of the Scarlet Flame Sect and an important inheritance of the Scarlet Flame Peak, mastering this skill would undoubtedly bring a significant increase to his overall strength.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Gu Qingfeng had a premonition about it.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Given his current state, if he were to continue cultivating the Crimson Flame Divine Art, he might be able to reach the true stage of perfection.</p><p></p><p>A perfect physical body!</p><p></p><p>It would be incomparable to ordinary physical bodies.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Comprehend the Crimson Flame Divine Art!</p><p></p><p>Cultivate it with full force!</p><p></p><p>Although the Crimson Flame Divine Art is a supreme and unparalleled technique, the initial stage of it is still not much of a challenge for Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>The vision of a Xiu Zang Third Realm cultivator is unmatched by cultivators of other realms. Even though the cultivation of the Crimson Flame Divine Art is extremely difficult, Gu Qingfeng was able to successfully complete the initial stage in less than a day.</p><p></p><p>The first layer of entry! The first layer of minor success! The first layer of great success! The first layer of perfection!...</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng only took ten days.</p><p></p><p>The first layer of the Crimson Flame Divine Art was completely perfected.</p><p></p><p>At the moment the first layer of the Crimson Flame Divine Art was perfected, Gu Qingfeng's physical body experienced violent tremors, with the surface skin layer peeling off, and then a brand-new skin emerging.</p><p></p><p>This new skin appeared no different from the previous one, but Gu Qingfeng could feel that the new skin had become more resilient than before, and its defensive capabilities had also greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect skin refinement!"</p><p></p><p>Brilliant light flashed in Gu Qingfeng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The so-called perfection means truly flawless and without any defects.</p><p></p><p>Now, Gu Qingfeng had entered the realm of perfect skin refinement, where he could control all the pores on his body. If he were to close all his pores, he could lock in his vital essence, thereby prolonging his lifespan.</p><p></p><p>As expected.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng looked at his own attribute panel, he found that his lifespan had quietly increased by a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>"Three hundred years of lifespan!"</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, even a Xian Tian Sect Master only has about three hundred years of lifespan. I, who am only at the Xiu Zang Third Realm, now have a lifespan of three hundred years, comparable to a Xian Tian Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>"In this case, it's clear that the benefits of a perfect physical body in locking in one's vital essence are indeed numerous!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng mused.</p><p></p><p>Perfect skin refinement has already reached this level.</p><p></p><p>If he could further advance to perfect blood refinement and even perfect bone refinement, he believes his lifespan would continue to increase.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng looked at the remaining fourteen enhancement points and immediately decided to allocate them all to the Crimson Flame Divine Art.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, eight enhancement points disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Divine Art instantly broke through from the first layer of perfection to the second layer of perfection.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Qingfeng once again felt the transformation of his qi and blood, truly achieving the state of cinnabar-like qi and blood, cleansing away all impurities.</p><p></p><p>Blood is the foundation of a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Now, with perfect blood refinement, Gu Qingfeng's strength had increased by at least 20%.</p><p></p><p>Then, it was time to address the matter of his lifespan.</p><p></p><p>His previous lifespan of three hundred years had now directly increased to five hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng resolutely used five more enhancement points to advance the Crimson Flame Divine Art from the second layer of perfection to the third layer of entry.</p><p></p><p>This time, he found that his iron-like bones had undergone some changes, but had not yet reached true perfection.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that in order to achieve perfect bone refinement, I need to cultivate more martial arts related to bone refinement."</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng was already quite satisfied with his current ability to achieve perfect skin refinement and perfect blood refinement.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the advancement of the Crimson Flame Divine Art had perfectly merged with the previous Scorching Yang Palm, with the latter being completely absorbed by the former.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Qingfeng immediately understood that the two martial arts were of the same origin.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, the Scorching Yang Palm was derived from the Crimson Flame Divine Art.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would be difficult to explain how the two martial arts could be assimilated and fused.</p><p></p><p>This also indirectly suggested that the Scorching Yang Immortal who created the Scorching Yang Palm might have some connection with the Crimson Flame Sect.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 62</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I am Stone Kai, pleased to meet the Gu Family Master!"</p><p></p><p>In the Gu Family's main hall, a burly man with a strong jawline and bushy beard respectfully cupped his fists towards Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>The man's muscular arms seemed to contain explosive power, but his expression was filled with reverence.</p><p></p><p>This was because the person standing before him was Gu Qingfeng, the Gu Family Master.</p><p></p><p>News of the Qingyang Sect's demise had already spread far and wide.</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family had wiped out the Qingyang Sect, but a few disciples had managed to escape with their lives.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the fact that the Gu Family had destroyed the Qingyang Sect could not be hidden.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, it was rumored that during the battle, the Qingyang Sect's Patriarch and Elder had both been killed on the spot by the opposing side.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, the outside world was spreading the word that this Gu Family Master had cultivation at least at the Gold Bone Perfection realm, and might even have reached the Marrow Cleansing realm.</p><p></p><p>Facing such a powerful expert, Stone Kai did not dare to show any disrespect, even though he had the backing of the entire Zhujiang Gate.</p><p></p><p>For while the Zhujiang Gate might be powerful within the White Stone Dao, its name carried little weight outside of it. Against forces like the Qingyang Sect, the Zhujiang Gate would be easily crushed with a mere wave of the hand.</p><p></p><p>If the Qingyang Sect could be destroyed so easily, Stone Kai dared not be careless in front of the Gu Family.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Stone Kai's cautious demeanor, Gu Qingfeng smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Master Stone, there's no need to be so formal. I've invited you here today because I would like to request your help in forging a weapon. Here are the design specifications, please take a look."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng produced the prepared drawings and handed them to Stone Kai. The latter took the papers and saw the outline of a longsword, not too different from a common longsword. He quickly glanced at it before shifting his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"What are the Gu Family Master's requirements for this sword?"</p><p></p><p>"I have two requirements: first, it must be extremely sharp; second, it must be highly durable. Also, I hope you can incorporate some gold into the forging process."</p><p></p><p>"Incorporate gold..."</p><p></p><p>Stone Kai's expression faltered slightly. In all his years of weapon forging, he had rarely seen people use gold in the process.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that gold was precious, and ordinary people had rarely even seen real gold, let alone owned any.</p><p></p><p>However, being an experienced master, Stone Kai quickly regained his composure.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, there shouldn't be any problems. But I'm not sure if the Gu Family Master has prepared the necessary materials?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course we have." Gu Qingfeng immediately clapped his hands and summoned a servant, instructing him briefly. The servant then bowed and withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, Gu Yang entered the hall.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "This is Master Stone Kai, the Sect Master of the Zhujiang Gate. Yang, please take Master Stone to our family's armory to select the appropriate forging materials."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng continued, "As for the remuneration for this forging task, we have agreed on ten thousand taels of silver, regardless of the outcome."</p><p></p><p>"Ten thousand taels of silver is quite a generous amount," Stone Kai said, his expression brightening, though he added tactfully, "Gu Family Master is too kind."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled calmly. "Master Stone, don't be so modest. The Zhujiang Gate is forging a weapon for the Gu Family; we cannot let you work for free. If news of this spreads, the Gu Family may be criticized by others."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Since Master Gu can provide ten thousand taels of silver, he must think that the Casting Sword Sect is worth that price!" </p><p></p><p>"Haha, then we are greatly appreciative of Master Gu!" </p><p></p><p>Stone Open laughed.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand taels of silver was also a sizable sum for the Casting Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Normally, when the Casting Sword Sect forged weapons, the prices were usually in the tens or hundreds of taels of silver, with the more expensive ones being only a thousand taels or so.</p><p></p><p>For it to be directly ten thousand taels of silver this time was quite rare.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Stone Open had prepared to serve the Gu family without asking for any compensation, because if he could further strengthen the relationship with the Gu family given their current reputation, that would be the best outcome.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>Half a day later.</p><p></p><p>Stone Open left.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, </p><p></p><p>the other party promised that the forging of the divine weapon would definitely be successful, in ten days at the shortest and one month at the longest.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not rush them excessively regarding this.</p><p></p><p>In the following period of time,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was responsible for the expansion of the Gu family, while Gu Qingfeng focused on cultivating other martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Then,</p><p></p><p>he passed down the corresponding martial arts to the Gu family's guards as he had originally promised.</p><p></p><p>Among them, for the guards at the Refining Skin realm, Gu Qingfeng taught the Chaos Iron Cloth Armor, which was the preliminary part of the Hundred Temperings Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>As for the Refining Blood realm cultivators, Gu Qingfeng taught a martial art called the Thirteen Great Guardians' Horizontal Practiced Golden Bell Cover. </p><p></p><p>This martial art originated from the Azure Yang Sect and was considered a good upper-grade martial art, which could be cultivated to the pinnacle to step into the Copper Bone Perfection realm.</p><p></p><p>Apart from this,</p><p></p><p>the Azure Yang Sect also had a supreme sect art called the Azure Yang Technique, which could be cultivated to the pinnacle to step into the Golden Bone Perfection realm, allowing the cultivator's strength to be comparable to the Half-Purification Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng naturally would not casually pass down such martial arts.</p><p></p><p>As mentioned before,</p><p></p><p>although these guards had joined the Gu family for some time, they had not yet reached the level of complete trust.</p><p></p><p>Like the Azure Yang Technique, which could be considered a top-tier upper-grade martial art, Gu Qingfeng would only select suitable people to impart it. As for the Thirteen Great Guardians' Horizontal Practiced Golden Bell Cover, which could be cultivated to the pinnacle to step into the Copper Bone Perfection realm, it was already a rare opportunity that many cultivators could not easily obtain.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore,</p><p></p><p>during this period,</p><p></p><p>thanks to the assistance of the Breakthrough Pill, Xu Yulan had successfully broken through to the Refining Blood Realm Perfection, becoming the second strongest in the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng was already aware of the power of the Breakthrough Pill, when he truly witnessed a Refining Skin Initial realm cultivator being able to break through to the Refining Blood Realm Perfection in less than half a month, he could not help but feel shocked.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary people, to achieve the transition from Refining Skin Initial to Refining Blood Realm Perfection might be a lifelong pursuit.</p><p></p><p>Even for true geniuses, it would require a considerable amount of time to take this step.</p><p></p><p>But the Breakthrough Pill was so unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>While everything was proceeding as usual in the Gu family, the news of the Azure Yang Sect's destruction had already swept across the entire Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Even outside of Guangyang Prefecture,</p><p></p><p>there were many people who had heard of the existence of the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Azure Yang Sect had been firmly rooted for hundreds of years, so its sudden destruction was a shock to all.</p><p></p><p>Especially for those forces that were aware of the Azure Yang Sect's true foundation, upon learning that the Azure Yang Sect had been destroyed and its Patriarch had been killed on the spot, they were even more greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>In the city of Guangyang Prefecture, there was a branch of the Exorcism Bureau.</p><p></p><p>The details of the Azure Yang Sect's destruction had now been compiled and quietly appeared in the hands of Lü Wenxuan, the commander of the Exorcism Bureau's branch.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

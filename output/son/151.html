        <h1>Chapter 151</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On this day,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang raised the banner of righteousness, declaring that natural disasters had plagued the land for years, the court had lost its virtue, and the common people could no longer sustain their lives. Therefore, he wished to purify the world and re-establish the heavens and the earth, proclaiming himself the King of Guangyang!</p><p></p><p>This news caused a great commotion once again.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the information panel, and corresponding text appeared on it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has become a king, achieving the status of 'Regional Lord' (can only be triggered once)!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 1000 Promotion Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 10 Grandmaster Ascension Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 3000 Elite Soldiers (Superior Talents)!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>This reward was exceptionally generous.</p><p></p><p>But,</p><p></p><p>it made Gu Qingfeng extremely satisfied.</p><p></p><p>After all, the previous achievement only gave him 300 Promotion Points.</p><p></p><p>This time, he directly received 1000 Promotion Points.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the other rewards.</p><p></p><p>The 1000 Promotion Points alone were enough to completely surpass anything he had received before.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p></p><p>such a bountiful amount of Promotion Points would be sufficient to significantly enhance Gu Qingfeng's strength.</p><p></p><p>As for the ten Grandmaster Ascension Elixirs and the three thousand Elite Soldiers, they were also extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>The former could directly cultivate ten peak Xiantian Grandmaster-level experts, and as for the latter, seeing the "Superior Talent" description, Gu Qingfeng already had some guesses.</p><p></p><p>Barring any unexpected circumstances,</p><p></p><p>the initial strength of these Elite Soldiers would not be too high, but their aptitude should be better than ordinary soldiers.</p><p></p><p>This meant a lower baseline but a higher ceiling.</p><p></p><p>If it had been at the beginning, Gu Qingfeng would have hoped for the Elite Soldiers to have a higher baseline, even if their ceiling was not as high, so they could still play a certain role.</p><p></p><p>But now, it was different.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family's strength was formidable, and Gu Yang had occupied Guangyang Prefecture, becoming the King of Guangyang. In this case, if a batch of superior-aptitude Elite Soldiers could be cultivated, they would not be underestimated in the future.</p><p></p><p>Immediately,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng walked out of the Whetstone Hall and directly summoned the three thousand Elite Soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Three thousand Elite Soldiers appeared.</p><p></p><p>There were both males and females, but without exception, they were all young men and women.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng directly incorporated this batch of people into the Shadow Guards, and then temporarily gave them the identity of outer sect disciples of the Gu family, handing them all over to Gu Peng.</p><p></p><p>"These people are the talents I have gathered from various places. Now, they are all under the management of the Outer Sect. You need to guide and instruct them in their cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng instructed.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Peng looked at the three thousand young men and women in front of him, his expression slightly changing, but he did not ask any further questions, only cupping his hands and saying, "I will follow your orders!"</p><p></p><p>After that,</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng led the three thousand Shadow Guards away.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of three thousand unfamiliar Outer Sect disciples naturally caused a stir within the Gu family manor, but upon learning that this batch of people were the talents Gu Qingfeng had gathered from various places, all voices were quickly silenced.</p><p></p><p>It was simple.</p><p></p><p>The nominal lord of the Gu family manor was Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>But everyone knew,</p><p></p><p>the true decision-maker of the Gu family manor was this old patriarch.</p><p></p><p>A Martial Dao Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>This alone was enough to inspire awe in others.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when it came to matters involving Gu Qingfeng, the middle and upper-level personnel of the Gu family manor did not dare to say much.</p><p></p><p>After Gu Peng left,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng turned his attention back to his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>The thousand Promotion Points were in his hands.</p><p></p><p>It was just enough to upgrade the Heavenly Vein True Classic.</p><p></p><p>Since he truly understood the power of the Heavenly Vein True Classic, Gu Qingfeng had always prioritized upgrading this cultivation method, only then focusing on improving other martial arts.</p><p></p><p>After all, the increase brought by other martial arts was far less than that of the Heavenly Vein True Classic.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was quick.</p><p></p><p>It cost one thousand promotion points.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng directly promoted the Heavenly Vein Classic to the second level, and his physical body also condensed the second Heavenly Vein.</p><p></p><p>Just like the previous blood-colored meridians, the second Heavenly Vein was equally powerful.</p><p></p><p>The two Heavenly Veins were condensed.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly and earthly forces that Gu Qingfeng could mobilize became increasingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>Even now, he could not be sure how terrifying it would be if he were to unleash the full power of the two great Heavenly Veins.</p><p></p><p>It was possible to reach the limit of a Grand Master! It was also possible to break through the barrier of the Grand Master!</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was waiting.</p><p></p><p>Waiting for a truly opportunity that would allow him to go all out.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ten days later.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng looked at the group of shadow guards in front of him, his expression filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>"Whew, the Old Master really found such a batch of talents from somewhere. In just ten days, they can vaguely touch the threshold of the Martial Dao, which means that in two or three months, they can directly break through the Refining Skin Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Being able to break through the Refining Skin Realm in three months meant that they were at the threshold of top-tier talents.</p><p></p><p>If they could break through the Refining Skin Realm in two months, then they would be among the top-tier talents.</p><p></p><p>If they could do it in a little over a month, then they would be at the pinnacle of top-tier talents.</p><p></p><p>Beyond that.</p><p></p><p>They would be supreme talents.</p><p></p><p>Although the Refining Skin Realm may seem like a simple entry-level stage of the Martial Dao, the first step of the entry is actually the most difficult.</p><p></p><p>Now.</p><p></p><p>The aptitude shown by the three thousand shadow guards can be considered extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention two or three months, Gu Peng suspected that in just over a month, these people would successively step into the threshold of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Having one or two such talents would be fine, but three thousand talents, to be honest, Gu Peng could not even imagine it.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>He also deeply felt that Gu Qingfeng's foundation was unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>With the ability to produce three thousand talents, who knows what kind of power is hidden behind him.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng has never had any thoughts of rebellion, so the stronger Gu Qingfeng's strength, the greater the benefit he sees for himself.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On this day.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng entered the Grinding Sword Hall again.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng asked, "How are the disciples I gave you last time doing?"</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Old Master, that batch of outer court disciples have remarkably good aptitude. In less than a month, they are almost able to step into the threshold of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>In my opinion, it will take at most half a month for them to all break through the Refining Skin Realm."</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng spoke truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was understanding.</p><p></p><p>According to the other party's words, this batch of shadow guard elites would break through the Refining Skin Realm in just over a month, once again surpassing his estimate of the shadow guard elites.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through the Refining Skin Realm in just over a month.</p><p></p><p>As long as they can be cultivated.</p><p></p><p>In the future, the three thousand shadow guards will be three thousand Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>Moreover.</p><p></p><p>With this level of talent, even if they break through to the Grand Master realm in the future, there is a chance.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Gu Family Manor has enough resources to cultivate them, these people can all grow into powerful helpers.</p><p></p><p>If it were the Gu Family Manor of the past, Gu Qingfeng would not have the confidence to cultivate three thousand such talents.</p><p></p><p>But now it's different.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang has become the King of Guangyang, controlling the entire Guangyang Prefecture, and the resources of an entire prefecture can be freely mobilized. Not to mention three thousand talents, even thirty thousand talents can be cultivated.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>After hearing Gu Peng's words and understanding the talents of the three thousand shadow guards, Gu Qingfeng was quite optimistic about their future.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention anything else.</p><p></p><p>Such a force placed in any power, it would be an extremely solid foundation.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

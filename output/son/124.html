        <h1>Chapter 124</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's not just the Liuyun Stronghold, but there are shadows of the Blood Spirit Sect behind some other green forest forces as well," the dark guard said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang's expression turned slightly cold. "It seems that we have destroyed too many strongholds in this period, which has drawn the attention of the Blood Spirit Sect, so they have sent people to investigate."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had heard of the Blood Spirit Sect before.</p><p></p><p>The Taishan Prefecture has twelve counties, with Qingjiang County being the most prominent. The Blood Spirit Sect is an ancient sect within Qingjiang County.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Gu Yang was that the Blood Spirit Sect had extended its reach to Guangyang Prefecture at some point.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the jianghu (martial arts world) of a county is not allowed to be interfered with by external forces. Now that the Blood Spirit Sect has secretly intervened, if the news were to be leaked, it would also provoke hostility from other local forces in Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Of course, that was in the past. Nowadays, with the appearance of an evil Buddha on the Nine Twists Path, the strength of the sects and aristocratic families in Guangyang Prefecture has been greatly diminished, which may have provided an opportunity for the Blood Spirit Sect to take advantage.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's understanding of the Blood Spirit Sect was limited.</p><p></p><p>He then looked at Gu Yi and said, "Have someone investigate the details of the Blood Spirit Sect, and have all the dark guards return, and for now, do not take any action!"</p><p></p><p>Since this round of suppressing the strongholds has drawn the attention of the Blood Spirit Sect, Gu Yang needs to be more careful. A thousand-year-old sect is not weak, and since Gu Yang has deliberately concealed his identity this time without leaving any survivors, if he is exposed due to the Blood Spirit Sect, it would be a considerable trouble.</p><p></p><p>After all, the foundation of the Gu family is currently too weak. In the past half year, although Gu Yang has been secretly recruiting troops and expanding his power, using Baishi City as a base and gradually expanding his control over the cities along the Baishi Road, this force is still not enough.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Gu Yang left with his people, taking away the abundant resources of the Liuyun Stronghold. In the dungeon of the Liuyun Stronghold, Gu Yang also found many civilians who had been imprisoned for a long time, most of them young and strong, but now on the verge of death from starvation. Gu Yang did not personally intervene, but had the dark guards secretly open the dungeon and then withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, a middle-aged man arrived calmly. When he saw the lifeless Liuyun Stronghold and a tortured corpse, his expression darkened.</p><p></p><p>"Daring to kill the elders of my Blood Spirit Sect, I want to see who dared to do this!" Yan Shaoyang's eyes were icy cold.</p><p></p><p>The corpse was that of an elder sent by the Blood Spirit Sect to the Liuyun Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>Years ago, the appearance of an evil Buddha on the Nine Twists Path had caused heavy losses to the various aristocratic sects in Guangyang Prefecture, giving the Blood Spirit Sect the opportunity to extend its influence there. Since then, the Blood Spirit Sect had secretly dispatched powerful cultivators to control various forces in Guangyang Prefecture, hoping to gather enough resources and population to support the sect's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, half a month ago, many green forest forces under the control of the Blood Spirit Sect were suddenly wiped out. When the news reached the sect, they were furious and immediately sent Yan Shaoyang and another elder to investigate the situation. Yan Shaoyang was responsible for going to the other forces, while the other elder was sent to a different area.</p><p></p><p>But soon...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The news of the destruction of the Liuyun Stronghold had arrived.</p><p></p><p>Yan Shaoyang arrived, only to find that he had come too late.</p><p></p><p>As for the death of an elder of the Xuelingzong, Yan Shaoyang actually didn't care much. </p><p></p><p>The Xuelingzong had many elders, and a mere Xiweidao elder was just an ordinary one. Whether there was one more or one less didn't make much difference. However, the fact that this elder had been killed meant that someone was challenging the Xuelingzong.</p><p></p><p>Yan Shaoyang couldn't help but suspect that the forces of Guangyang Prefecture might have sensed something. The destruction of the Liuyun Stronghold and other Green Forest forces was likely related to those powers.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Yan Shaoyang carefully examined the wounds on the body.</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Killing Blade Technique!"</p><p></p><p>"This is a military martial art--"</p><p></p><p>"No, there is also a trace of the Crimson Flame Palm energy here. Could it be someone from the Crimson Flame Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Shaoyang's expression kept changing.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Killing Blade Technique! The Crimson Flame Palm energy!</p><p></p><p>The former, although a military martial art, could have spread to the rivers and lakes and been obtained by other forces, which was normal. But the Crimson Flame Divine Skill was different.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Yan Shaoyang had reason to suspect that these matters were related to the Crimson Flame Sect.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Yan Shaoyang's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>If it was the work of other forces, the Xuelingzong would not be too worried. But if it was the Crimson Flame Sect, the problem could be big or small.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Crimson Flame Sect's strength had been greatly diminished, it was still a thousand-year-old sect. Moreover, this was in the territory of Guangyang Prefecture. If a conflict were to break out, the Xuelingzong might not necessarily come out on top.</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Yan Shaoyang turned and left. This matter was not trivial, and he had to go back and report it to the sect.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>At the Gu Family Manor, Gu Yang reported the matter of the Xuelingzong to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression remained calm. "The problem of the Xuelingzong doesn't need to be paid too much attention to. The so-called thousand-year-old family sects are not a concern. The only thing to pay attention to now are the Immortal Sects!"</p><p></p><p>"With Father's words, I feel relieved!" Gu Yang said in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He was very clear about Gu Qingfeng's character - he never did anything without being certain. Since his father said that, it meant that the so-called thousand-year-old family sects were truly not a concern.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Gu Yang couldn't help but ask, "Father, what level of cultivation have you reached now?"</p><p></p><p>"My cultivation?" Gu Qingfeng suddenly smiled.</p><p></p><p>"The path I have taken is different from ordinary martial artists. In terms of realm, I should now be at the peak of the Refining Impurity Fifth Realm, but in terms of actual strength, I can also slay True Meaning Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>As for lifespan, even Qi Blood Sect Masters may not be my equal!"</p><p></p><p>In Gu Qingfeng's view, the martial dao he was walking was the true martial dao. As for the martial dao of others, he didn't say it was false, only that it was incomplete.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's spirit was shaken. "The rumors say that Qi Blood Sect Masters can live for five hundred years. Father, without reaching the Sect Master realm, your lifespan can exceed that of Qi Blood Sect Masters?"</p><p></p><p>"The martial dao of the world has flaws. The path I walk is the perfect martial dao. The world believes that Sorcerers are supreme and martial dao is inferior, but I do not think so!"</p><p></p><p>"It's just that the truly perfect martial dao still requires some time for me to perfect. When I can perfect it completely, I will pass it on to you and the others."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>Now, Sorcerers were supreme, and evil spirits ran rampant. In other words, the world lacked the power to effectively resist Sorcerers and evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>If the martial dao was truly flawless, the current situation could be broken.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 124</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's not just the Liuyun Stronghold, but there are shadows of the Blood Spirit Sect behind some other green forest forces as well," the dark guard said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang's expression turned slightly cold. "It seems that we have eliminated too many strongholds in this period, which has drawn the attention of the Blood Spirit Sect, so they have sent people to investigate."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had heard of the Blood Spirit Sect before.</p><p></p><p>The Taishan Prefecture has twelve counties, with Qingjiang County being the most prominent. The Blood Spirit Sect is an ancient sect within Qingjiang County.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Gu Yang was that the Blood Spirit Sect had extended its reach to Guangyang Prefecture at some point.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the jianghu (martial world) of a county would not allow external forces to interfere. Now that the Blood Spirit Sect has secretly infiltrated, if the news were to be leaked, it would invite hostility from other local powers in Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Of course, that was in the past. Nowadays, with the appearance of an evil Buddha on the Nine Turns Path, the strength of the sects and aristocratic families in Guangyang Prefecture has been greatly diminished, which has likely provided an opportunity for the Blood Spirit Sect to take advantage.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's understanding of the Blood Spirit Sect was limited.</p><p></p><p>He then looked at Gu Yi and said, "Have someone investigate the details of the Blood Spirit Sect, and have all the dark guards return, and for now, do not take any action!"</p><p></p><p>Since this round of eliminating the strongholds has drawn the attention of the Blood Spirit Sect, Gu Yang needs to be extra cautious. A thousand-year-old sect is not weak, and Gu Yang has deliberately concealed his identity without leaving any survivors. If his identity is exposed due to the Blood Spirit Sect, it would be a significant problem.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Gu family's foundation is currently too weak. In the past half year, although Gu Yang has been secretly recruiting troops and expanding his power, with White Stone City as the base, and gradually bringing the cities along the White Stone Path under his control, this force is still not enough.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Gu Yang left with his people, taking away the abundant resources from the Liuyun Stronghold. In the dungeon of the Liuyun Stronghold, Gu Yang also found many civilians who had been imprisoned for a long time, most of them young and strong, but now on the verge of death from starvation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang did not personally intervene, but had the dark guards secretly open the dungeon and then led the people away.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, a middle-aged man arrived gracefully. Seeing the Liuyun Stronghold completely devoid of any living person, his expression remained calm. However, when he saw a tortured and disfigured corpse, his face darkened.</p><p></p><p>"Daring to kill the elders of my Blood Spirit Sect, I must find out who was behind this!" Yan Shaoyang's eyes turned icy cold.</p><p></p><p>The corpse was that of an elder sent by the Blood Spirit Sect to the Liuyun Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>Years ago, the appearance of an evil Buddha on the Nine Turns Path in Guangyang Prefecture had caused heavy losses to the various aristocratic sects, which gave the Blood Spirit Sect the opportunity to extend its influence into Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>After that, the Blood Spirit Sect had secretly dispatched powerful cultivators to Guangyang Prefecture, covertly controlling various forces, in the hopes of gathering enough resources and population to support the sect's cultivation needs.</p><p></p><p>However, half a month ago, many of the green forest forces under the Blood Spirit Sect's control were suddenly eliminated. When the news reached the sect, they were enraged and immediately dispatched Yan Shaoyang and another elder to investigate the situation.</p><p></p><p>Yan Shaoyang was responsible for visiting the other forces, while the other elder was sent to a different area.</p><p></p><p>But soon...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The news of the destruction of the Liuyun Stronghold had arrived.</p><p></p><p>Yan Shaoyang arrived, only to find that he had come too late.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the death of a Blood Spirit Sect elder, Yan Shaoyang was actually not too concerned. There were many elders in the Blood Spirit Sect, and a mere Xiweiing Realm elder was just an ordinary one. Whether there was one more or one less made little difference. However, the fact that this elder had been killed meant that someone was challenging the Blood Spirit Sect.</p><p></p><p>Yan Shaoyang couldn't help but suspect that the forces of Guangyang Prefecture might have discovered something. The destruction of the Liuyun Stronghold and other Green Forest forces was likely related to those powers.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, Yan Shaoyang carefully examined the wounds on the body.</p><p></p><p>"Seven Killing Blade Technique! This is a military martial artâ€”"</p><p></p><p>"No, there is also a trace of the Scarlet Flame Palm energy here. Could it be someone from the Scarlet Flame Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Shaoyang's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Killing Blade Technique, while a military martial art, could have spread to the rivers and lakes and been obtained by other forces. But the Scarlet Flame Divine Skill was different.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Yan Shaoyang had reason to suspect that these events were related to the Scarlet Flame Sect.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Yan Shaoyang's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>If it was another force that had acted, the Blood Spirit Sect would not be too worried. But if it was the Scarlet Flame Sect, the problem could be big or small. Even though the Scarlet Flame Sect had suffered heavy losses in strength, it was still a thousand-year-old sect. Moreover, this was in the territory of Guangyang Prefecture, so if a conflict were to break out, the Blood Spirit Sect might not necessarily come out on top.</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Yan Shaoyang turned and left. This matter was not trivial, and he had to go back and report it to the sect.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Manor.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang returned with his men and then reported the matter of the Blood Spirit Sect to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was calm. "The problem of the Blood Spirit Sect does not need to be paid too much attention to. The so-called thousand-year-old family sects are not a concern. The only thing to be mindful of now are the Immortal Sects!"</p><p></p><p>"With Father's words, I am relieved!" Gu Yang thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He was very clear about Gu Qingfeng's character - he never did anything without being certain. Since his father said that, it meant that the so-called thousand-year-old family sects were truly not a concern.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Gu Yang couldn't help but ask, "Father, what level of cultivation have you reached now?"</p><p></p><p>"My cultivation?" Gu Qingfeng suddenly smiled.</p><p></p><p>"The path I have taken is different from ordinary martial artists. In terms of realm, I am now at the peak of the Refining Impurity Fifth Realm, but in terms of actual strength, I can even slay True Meaning Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>As for lifespan, even Blood Qi Sect Masters may not be my equal!"</p><p></p><p>In Gu Qingfeng's view, the martial dao he was walking was the true martial dao. As for the martial dao of others, he didn't consider it false, only that it was incomplete.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's spirit was shaken. "The rumors say that Blood Qi Sect Masters can live for five hundred years. Father, without reaching the Sect Master realm, your lifespan can exceed that of Blood Qi Sect Masters?"</p><p></p><p>"The martial dao of the world has flaws. The perfect martial dao that I walk is not what the world considers supreme, with Sorcerers being revered and martial dao being inferior. But I do not think so!"</p><p></p><p>"It will just take me some more time to perfect this true martial dao. When I can perfect it completely, I will pass it on to you and the others."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>Now, Sorcerers were revered, and evil spirits ran rampant. In other words, the world lacked the power to effectively resist Sorcerers and evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>If the martial dao was truly flawless,</p><p></p><p>Then the current situation could be broken.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What's this?</p><p></p><p>Fu He felt as if he was living in a dream. The Blood Cloud Patriarch, who had dominated the Eastern Domain for years, was forcefully killed on the spot without any chance of resistance.</p><p></p><p>Such power.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Sacred Land of the Void, it would belong to the top tier.</p><p></p><p>All along,</p><p></p><p>Fu He had thought that Gu Qingfeng was only a Shenbian Realm cultivator, after all, he had some understanding of Gu Qingfeng's battle achievements from Gu Xuan.</p><p></p><p>More importantly,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's age is not too old.</p><p></p><p>Compared to other Shenbian Realm cultivators in the Eastern Domain who have cultivated for hundreds or even thousands of years, Gu Qingfeng has only cultivated for a few decades.</p><p></p><p>To be able to enter the Shenbian Realm in just a few decades is already quite amazing.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Eastern Domain, only a few prodigies can do this.</p><p></p><p>Howeverâ€”</p><p></p><p>Now someone has told him that Gu Qingfeng is not in the Shenbian Realm, but a top-tier Daogong Realm expert, how can Fu He not be shocked.</p><p></p><p>It's not just Fu He who is shocked.</p><p></p><p>Even Gu Xuan standing beside him was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect</p><p></p><p>That his father's strength was hidden so deeply.</p><p></p><p>Defeating a Daogong Realm expert at the third level with just two moves has truly opened Gu Xuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Fu He shook his head and bitterly smiled: "It seems your previous worries are unnecessary. With your father's strength, even if the Saint's Legacy is really in his hands, I'm afraid no one would dare to covet it."</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng suddenly looked towards this place, and as their eyes met, Fu He only felt a terrifying pressure suddenly appear, as if a supreme heavenly sword was about to descend, making him instinctively want to turn and run.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng just glanced over and then withdrew his gaze.</p><p></p><p>In that moment,</p><p></p><p>Fu He's back was already soaked in sweat, and his shock towards Gu Qingfeng deepened even further.</p><p></p><p>Just a glance made him feel like he was about to perish on the spot.</p><p></p><p>It's clear that</p><p></p><p>If this expert wanted to kill him, it would be as easy as a single thought.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful expert,</p><p></p><p>made Fu He feel reverence.</p><p></p><p>At this time,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng descended into Xing'an County, and the terrifying pressure that had weighed down the void had completely dissipated, but all the cultivators outside now felt as if a great mountain was pressing down on them, making it difficult for them to breathe.</p><p></p><p>The scene of the Blood Cloud Patriarch's demise was deeply imprinted in their minds.</p><p></p><p>With such a powerful expert guarding, the other cultivators did not dare to act rashly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xing'an County.</p><p></p><p>Inside the county government.</p><p></p><p>County Magistrate Su Guang stood respectfully in front of Gu Qingfeng, bowing deeply: "This official pays respects to Senior Gu. This time, thanks to Senior Gu's intervention, Xing'an County was able to avoid disaster."</p><p></p><p>Regarding Gu Qingfeng's action of directly killing the Blood Cloud Patriarch, Su Guang's heart was filled with even greater reverence.</p><p></p><p>He had witnessed the Blood Cloud Patriarch's formidable strength, and even using the fortune of Xing'an County, he would have been unable to withstand a single strike from the opponent.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for Gu Qingfeng's appearance, Xing'an County would most likely have become a doomed land.</p><p></p><p>This was something</p><p></p><p>Su Guang did not doubt at all.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Great Xuan Dynasty had only just been established, and Su Guang had not forgotten the chaotic situation in the past during the late Great Xuan era.</p><p></p><p>At that time, evil sorcerers and monsters were rampant, and the sacking of cities was a common occurrence.</p><p></p><p>It was not until the establishment of the Shenwu Dynasty, when that Gu Emperor cultivated the Nine Tripod Sutra to suppress the Nine Provinces, that the evil sorcerers were finally exterminated and disappeared from the world.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>if Gu Qingfeng had not appeared,</p><p></p><p>the fate of Xing'an County would have been obvious.</p><p></p><p>"You have done well!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the person in front of him, his expression somewhat satisfied.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator at the Lianzu Fifth Realm has the courage to face a Daogong Realm expert, and this boldness alone is not something that other people can possess.</p><p></p><p>Immediately,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng flicked his finger, and two medicinal pills fell in front of Su Guang.</p><p></p><p>"These two pills, one is the Lianzu Dan, which can assist you in cultivating your viscera. Although you have already reached the Lianzu Fifth Realm, the refinement of your viscera is still not complete.</p><p></p><p>The other is the Jinsheng Dan, which should be a pill used by Zongshi masters, but you can barely consume it with your current cultivation. This pill can help you refine your flesh and blood, allowing you to enter the Zongshi Realm faster."</p><p></p><p>"This official is greatly thankful to Senior Gu!" </p><p></p><p>Su Guang tightly gripped the two medicinal pills in his hands, his joy clearly visible.</p><p></p><p>Breakthrough to Zongshi!</p><p></p><p>This has always been his long-cherished wish.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>even though the Shenwu Dynasty has now spread its might across the world, and as a government official he can obtain many rare cultivation techniques and arts, actually reaching the Zongshi Realm is not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>Especially after the incident with the Blood Cloud Patriarch, it has made Su Guang realize the weakness of his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Lianzu Fifth Realm,</p><p></p><p>in the past, would have been a powerful cultivator capable of founding a sect and enjoying a respectable status in the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>After all, in that era when the martial dao was in decline, truly powerful Zongshi cultivators were not many, so reaching the Lianzu Fifth Realm was already extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the Shenwu Dynasty promoting the martial dao, and the arrival of external powerful experts, Su Guang has realized the vastness of the world.</p><p></p><p>In this case,</p><p></p><p>the Lianzu Fifth Realm cultivation is somewhat lacking.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng asked, "What cultivation technique are you currently practicing?"</p><p></p><p>"This official is cultivating the Xuanlei True Technique!" </p><p></p><p>Su Guang answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"This is a Zongshi-level cultivation technique. If cultivated to perfection, it can allow one to reach the peak of the Zongshi Realm, but alas, this official's talent is limited, and I have not been able to break through to the Zongshi Realm until now."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Su Guang's face also showed some embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, upon hearing the name Xuanlei True Technique, Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>This cultivation method,</p><p></p><p>he has also heard of it before.</p><p></p><p>To be precise,</p><p></p><p>the Gu Family Manor currently has this Zongshi-level technique recorded.</p><p></p><p>Since the establishment of the Shenwu Dynasty, Gu Yang has implemented a series of policies to strengthen the country, such as granting officials cultivation techniques according to their official position, cultivation realm, and achievements.</p><p></p><p>Like Su Guang, as the County Magistrate of Xing'an County, he has been granted a Zongshi-level technique.</p><p></p><p>If one day,</p><p></p><p>Su Guang can break through to the Zongshi Realm, and has made outstanding contributions in Xing'an County over the years, then after verification by the court, he may be directly granted a Great Zongshi Realm technique.</p><p></p><p>This kind of approach,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has also discussed with Gu Yang and obtained his approval before it was truly implemented.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sent a divine sense into Su Guang's sea of consciousness, causing the latter to become dumbfounded, and it took him a long time to finally digest the abruptly appearing information in his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will pass on the Purple Extreme Dao Canon to you, a technique that directly points to the peak of the Shenbian Realm. I hope you will cultivate it diligently. Furthermore, this technique can only be cultivated by you alone, and without my permission, you must not teach it to anyone else."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely do not pass it on to anyone else. If you violate this, I will not let you off lightly!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression became stern as he spoke in a cold voice.</p><p></p><p>Su Guangdao hurriedly replied, "This subordinate understands. Even if I die, I will never reveal the cultivation method bestowed by the senior!"</p><p></p><p>Given Su Guangdao's perspective, he was naturally aware of the importance of the Purple Extreme Dao Canon. It was a cultivation method that could reach the peak of the Divine Transformation Realm. Perhaps across the Nine Provinces, there were not many cultivators who could truly obtain it. </p><p></p><p>The imperial court had already announced the realms beyond the Grand Grandmaster, so Su Guangdao naturally knew what the Divine Transformation Realm was.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng waved his hand to dismiss Su Guangdao, and the latter left as instructed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had his own reasons for bestowing the Purple Extreme Dao Canon upon Su Guangdao. As he had said, there were too few powerful experts that the Shenwu Dynasty could utilize now. </p><p></p><p>In Gu Qingfeng's eyes, Su Guangdao's recent actions were not bad, at least they had the meaning of cultivation. Moreover, at such a young age, he had already entered the fifth layer of the Refining Impurity Realm, his natural talent was not too bad. By bestowing the Purple Extreme Dao Canon upon him, Gu Qingfeng also wanted to see how far this cultivator from Xing'an County could go.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps one day, this person can truly bring me some surprises!" Gu Qingfeng murmured with a slight nod.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a yamen runner entered the inner hall and respectfully said to Gu Qingfeng, "Report to Senior Gu, Prince Qing is seeking an audience in the yamen!"</p><p></p><p>Prince Qing naturally referred to Gu Xuan. After Gu Yang's ascension, Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu had both been enfeoffed as princes, with Gu Xuan as the Prince Qing and Gu Xiu as the Prince Yun, combining to form the "Qing-Yun" title. </p><p></p><p>As for Gu Qingfeng, Gu Yang did not know how to enfeoff him, and after consulting with him, he gave up on the idea.</p><p></p><p>"Let them come in," Gu Qingfeng said with a sweep of his spiritual sense, seeing Gu Xuan and Fu He outside the yamen.</p><p></p><p>The yamen runner bowed and withdrew. Soon, the two entered the inner hall.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan immediately bowed to Gu Qingfeng, "Greetings, Father!"</p><p></p><p>Fu He, standing beside him, also cupped his hands respectfully, "Elder Fu He of the Taixu Sacred Land, greets the senior."</p><p></p><p>Before Gu Qingfeng could speak, Gu Xuan quickly explained, "Father, I have already taken Elder Fu as my teacher."</p><p></p><p>"So you have become a disciple of a powerful cultivator from the Taixu Sacred Land. This unworthy descendant being able to enter Elder Fu's tutelage is indeed his honor," Gu Qingfeng said with a slight smile, returning Fu He's greeting.</p><p></p><p>Regarding Fu He, Gu Qingfeng's impression of him was quite good. If he had not intervened, perhaps Gu Xuan would not have survived his venture into the Ancient Beast Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fu He hurriedly said, "The senior is too kind."</p><p></p><p>In the presence of a Dao Palace Realm expert, Fu He dared not be presumptuous. Even if it was an ordinary Dao Palace cultivator, he would not dare to be reckless, let alone someone who could easily defeat the Blood Cloud Patriarch with just two moves.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng waved his hand, "Since Xuan'er has taken you as his teacher, there's no need for the 'senior' title. We can converse as equals."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, then I shall follow the... friend's words," Fu He quickly corrected himself.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled faintly, "Come to think of it, I also feel a sense of kinship with Elder Fu."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, he glanced at Gu Xuan and his expression became stern. "You may leave first."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Gu Xuan dared not speak further and hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>He had encountered some troubles during his previous expedition outside, which must have angered Gu Qingfeng. So when facing Gu Qingfeng, Gu Xuan felt uneasy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Now that Gu Qingfeng had spoken, he did not dare to linger. After all, Gu Qingfeng had beaten him up many times before, and he was afraid of being punished again, especially in front of Fu He.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was not just Gu Xuan who feared Gu Qingfeng. Gu Xiu was the same.</p><p></p><p>After Gu Xuan left, Gu Qingfeng's expression became warm again as he said to Fu He, "Elder Fu has come from the Eastern Domain, and I'm not too familiar with the Eastern Domain. I hope Elder Fu can enlighten me on some matters."</p><p></p><p>"Friend, please feel free to ask. If I know the answer, I will certainly share it," Fu He responded seriously.</p><p></p><p>If he could establish a good relationship with such a powerful cultivator, there would only be benefits and no drawbacks. So when Gu Qingfeng had questions, Fu He would not refuse.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not hesitate, directly inquiring about various matters related to the Wasteland Ancient Realm, covering a wide range of topics.</p><p></p><p>The reason for this was that although Gu Qingfeng had obtained information from Meng Ruxiu's legacy and the memories of Ke Lao and others, he still lacked a comprehensive understanding of the Wasteland Ancient Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for Gu Qingfeng's questions, Fu He spoke without reservation, answering everything he knew clearly and thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Fu He also took the opportunity to ask Gu Qingfeng for guidance on some cultivation-related issues, and Gu Qingfeng readily shared his insights, as it was a simple matter for him to instruct a cultivator at the ninth layer of the Divine Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the two enjoyed a mutually beneficial exchange, with Gu Qingfeng obtaining the information he desired, and Fu He receiving guidance that allowed him to glimpse a clearer path forward.</p><p></p><p>For Fu He, he had been stuck at the Divine Transformation Realm for a long time without breakthrough. Now, with Gu Qingfeng's pointers, although he had not yet taken that final step, he had at least saved himself a lot of arduous cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Fu He shook his head and sighed, "Originally, Gu Xuan sent me here to the Nine Provinces, worried that the affairs of the Shenyang Sacred Land would affect the Gu Clan. But now it seems he was overly concerned. With Friend Gu here, even if the Shenyang Sacred Land's inheritance appears, I doubt anyone would dare to act rashly."</p><p></p><p>This was not just Fu He's empty flattery, but the simple truth. While the inheritance of a Saint was valuable, it depended on whose hands it fell into. In the hands of a top-tier Dao Palace Realm expert like Gu Qingfeng, even if other powers were aware of the Saint's inheritance, they would not dare to make any moves.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, I've heard that the true culprit behind the destruction of the Shenyang Sacred Land was a force called the Yin-Yang Sacred Land. I wonder how much Elder Fu knows about the Yin-Yang Sacred Land?" Gu Qingfeng asked.</p><p></p><p>This statement was Gu Qingfeng's tacit acknowledgment that the inheritance of the Shenyang Sacred Land, as well as that Saint's inheritance, were now in his possession.</p><p></p><p>Fu He's expression did not change at all as he unhesitatingly replied, "The Yin-Yang Sacred Land is a force that appeared thousands of years ago. Two thousand years ago, a Saint from this sacred land descended, but it is rumored that this Saint later attained Nirvana. Since then, the Yin-Yang Sacred Land's strength has weakened somewhat. However, even now, the Yin-Yang Sacred Land still has five Dao Palace Realm experts guarding it, with the Yin-Yang Sacred Master being a powerful cultivator at the peak of the Dao Palace Realm!"</p>

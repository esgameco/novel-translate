        <h1>Chapter 143</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, </p><p></p><p>Gu Peng told everything that had happened.</p><p></p><p>"Collect all the martial arts in the world?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang slightly nodded his head, and then immediately issued an order.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, </p><p></p><p>a group of people carried up more than a dozen boxes.</p><p></p><p>"These are the martial arts obtained from eliminating various forces by the army. I've had someone arrange them, so Gu Hall Master can take this batch of martial arts back and hand them over to Father."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family army had campaigned in various regions, and not all forces were willing to submit. Whenever there was any resistance, Gu Yang showed no mercy and directly eliminated them.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts mastered by these eliminated forces naturally fell into Gu Yang's hands.</p><p></p><p>The reason for doing this was to make an example and warn the others.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Gu family army wanted to subdue the entire Guangyang Prefecture as quickly as possible, so they had to use thunderous methods.</p><p></p><p>The reputation of a single grand master alone was not enough to make all forces submit.</p><p></p><p>There were also some forces that wanted to remain neutral and not get involved in this war.</p><p></p><p>However, in the current chaotic situation, there was no such thing as neutrality.</p><p></p><p>It was either submit or be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>There was no third possibility.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Yang eliminated these forces to tell the other forces that if they did not submit, they would only have the path of death.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, Gu Peng had no objections.</p><p></p><p>After the others left, Gu Yang summoned the members of the Shadow Guard.</p><p></p><p>"Greet the Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"How are the remnants of the court doing?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang asked indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Gui Yi respectfully reported, "Half a day ago, the Shadow Guard has found the whereabouts of the court remnants and completely eliminated them!"</p><p></p><p>"Good!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Yang nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Although Pei Jing's Divine Might Army had defeated the court's main army in Guangyang Prefecture, they had not truly brought the entire Guangyang Prefecture under control, and half of the territory was still under court jurisdiction.</p><p></p><p>Banan Circuit was one of them.</p><p></p><p>However, those were all matters of the past.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang led the Gu family army to enter Banan Circuit and swept away everything with thunderous force. In less than five days, the court was completely routed, leaving only a few remnant troops struggling to survive and attempting to secretly disrupt the Gu family army's actions.</p><p></p><p>For this, Gu Yang naturally would not tolerate them.</p><p></p><p>He directly mobilized the Shadow Guard to eliminate these court remnants.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, the Shadow Guard did not disappoint Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Gu Yang had never doubted the Shadow Guard's abilities.</p><p></p><p>Especially after the battle at the North Gate Pass, Gu Yang discovered that the Shadow Guard under his command had undergone some changes.</p><p></p><p>These changes were reflected in their strength.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang suspected that Gu Qingfeng must have mastered some secret techniques or other means to enhance the martial artists' abilities.</p><p></p><p>However, these secret techniques and methods likely had some side effects.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Gu Qingfeng would not have only enhanced the Shadow Guard's strength without using them himself.</p><p></p><p>In terms of father-son emotions, Gu Yang had no doubts.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Gu Yang had no desire to investigate the secret techniques and methods that Gu Qingfeng possessed. Everyone had their own secrets, and if the father was willing to share, he would naturally tell his son. If he was unwilling, no matter how much Gu Yang asked, it would be useless.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Gu Yang also tried to inquire Gui Yi about it, but the latter was extremely evasive, so Gu Yang could not get any information.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He then gave up on this idea.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang slowly walked to the center of the hall, where there was a sand table displaying the layout of the entire Guangyang Prefecture with its seventy-two districts.</p><p></p><p>On the sand table,</p><p></p><p>there were three types of flags.</p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Flag! The Shenwu Flag! The Gu Family Flag! These represented the three powers: the Taixuan Dynasty, the Shenwu Army, and the Gu Family Army.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Pei Jing had decisively defeated the Guangyang Prefecture's main army, leading the Shenwu Army to enter this place, and half of the seventy-two districts should have fallen under their control.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing was defeated at the North Gate, directly losing his life on the spot, which led to great chaos within the Shenwu Army, allowing the court to seize the opportunity to launch a suppression of the various rebel armies and reclaim most of the territory.</p><p></p><p>As a result,</p><p></p><p>the Taixuan Flag representing the court now occupies about half of the Guangyang Prefecture's territory on the sand table.</p><p></p><p>Of the remaining thirty-six districts, the Gu Family Army has now taken control of thirteen, while the other twenty-three are temporarily under the control of the Shenwu Army.</p><p></p><p>But all of this is only temporary.</p><p></p><p>Now that Gu Yang is personally leading a large army, carrying the title of a Grand Master, the Guangyang Prefecture's court army and the Shenwu Army will undoubtedly be no match for him.</p><p></p><p>This,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang is absolutely confident about.</p><p></p><p>After absorbing the remnants of Pei Jing's army and taking control of thirteen districts, the Gu Family Army's numbers have directly expanded to five hundred thousand.</p><p></p><p>This large army, compared to the initial size, is more than five times larger.</p><p></p><p>Even though most of these five hundred thousand soldiers have only recently been recruited and their combat power is questionable, this is still a force of five hundred thousand, a strength that cannot be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, Gu Yang does not have much time to slowly integrate the army, and can only take a snowball-like approach to first conquer the Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>To compete for the world,</p><p></p><p>at least he must have one prefecture as a foundation, then there would be a chance.</p><p></p><p>If he cannot even conquer one prefecture, relying on the small amount of land under his control, how can he cultivate enough capable people.</p><p></p><p>After glancing at the sand table for a moment, Gu Yang picked up a Gu Family flag and directly inserted it into the Taixun Road.</p><p></p><p>"Next!"</p><p></p><p>"The Gu Family Army's target will be the Taixun Road!"</p><p></p><p>"Coincidentally, my father needs martial arts scriptures, and the Taixun Road has the Chiyan Sect stationed there. If this sect is sensible, perhaps they can be allowed to continue their legacy. If they are not sensible, then they have no reason to exist!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's gaze was cold and icy, and a strong aura of killing intent was emanating from him.</p><p></p><p>During this period, the number of people who have died directly or indirectly at Gu Yang's hands while he led the army to conquer various places is already countless.</p><p></p><p>Controlling the power of life and death has also tempered his ruthlessness.</p><p></p><p>To be honest,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang does not want to kill too many people.</p><p></p><p>After all, if he were to completely massacre the entire Guangyang Prefecture, then even if he were to occupy the entire prefecture later, it would be difficult for him to have any usable people under his command.</p><p></p><p>Up to now, the various Gu Family Army commanders are people that Gu Yang had originally cultivated, and although they are temporarily sufficient, if he wants to further expand, it will become a bit of a tight squeeze.</p><p></p><p>But the problem is,</p><p></p><p>some things are not something Gu Yang can choose not to kill if he doesn't want to.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>killing to stop the killing.</p><p></p><p>Is also a method.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Yi, you will go to the Chiyan Sect in my stead, tell them that if they are willing to submit to my Gu Family Manor, all past grievances can be forgiven."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang paused here.</p><p></p><p>"Take some elite bodyguards with you. If the Chiyan Sect is unwilling, then you can directly destroy the Chiyan Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi immediately accepted the order and withdrew.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 34</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The turmoil outside was surging.</p><p></p><p>But the Gu family remained peaceful.</p><p></p><p>Some forces, fearing Gu Qingfeng's ruthless methods, came to pay their respects in a hurry not long after the Qin family was destroyed.</p><p></p><p>As for this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not really drive these people away or kill them all.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p></p><p>to completely wipe out the entire Baishi Dao faction in the jianghu would not bring him much benefit.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the dead of night,</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng hurriedly arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Master, there is news from outside that the Tianyun Sect wants to unite the major factions to deal with the Gu family."</p><p></p><p>"Tianyun Sect—"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes grew slightly cold.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't gone to trouble them yet, and they are rushing to seek their own deaths. Since the Tianyun Sect wants to court death, then I shall oblige them."</p><p></p><p>"Master, what do you plan to do?"</p><p></p><p>"The Qin family has already been destroyed, so destroying the Tianyun Sect as well is of little consequence. Suppress all the voices of resistance, and the rest will naturally have to submit."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was cold, and in his heart, he had already pronounced the death sentence on the Tianyun Sect.</p><p></p><p>Originally,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had the idea of attacking the Tianyun Sect.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the Qin family had just been destroyed, and there were some matters that needed to be dealt with, so he temporarily did not have the time.</p><p></p><p>Additionally,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also wanted to give the Tianyun Sect a chance.</p><p></p><p>If the Tianyun Sect could submit to the Gu family, that would be the best.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Tianyun Sect's strength is not weak, with a powerful Blood Refining Realm cultivator as their leader. If they could be brought under control, it would further strengthen the Gu family's power.</p><p></p><p>But now,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng no longer intends to waste time.</p><p></p><p>The Tianyun Sect wants to court death.</p><p></p><p>Then he shall oblige them.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the person in front of him and asked indifferently, "What is the specific situation with the Tianyun Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Yuntianhang is now uniting various factions, preparing to hold a Demon-Slaying Assembly at the Tianyun Sect in three days, intending to deal with our Gu family."</p><p></p><p>"Three days later—"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly, then had Meng Peng take his leave.</p><p></p><p>Soon after Meng Peng left, a fragrant breeze wafted in, and Gu Qingfeng looked up to see Xu Yulan slowly walking in.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>he stood up to support her.</p><p></p><p>"The night is deep, and the Lady should be resting, what are you doing here?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the bulge in her abdomen, and his expression became even more gentle.</p><p></p><p>With his keen perception, he could sense the faint life within the belly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yulan caressed her abdomen and softly said, "I heard during the day that you destroyed the Qin family?"</p><p></p><p>"The Qin family was determined to oppose my Gu family, so I had to destroy them. I will not tolerate any potential threats to the Gu family."</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Gu Qingfeng's expression became slightly cold, but it soon returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yulan shook her head slightly: "The Qin family was powerful, and they had a considerable reputation in the jianghu over the years. After you destroyed the Qin family, the aftermath trouble is likely to be not small."</p><p></p><p>"Trouble—"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled confidently, and a sense of solemnity emanated from him.</p><p></p><p>"The jianghu speaks with strength. The weak fear trouble, but the strong have nothing to fear. Today I destroyed the Qin family, and if anyone is dissatisfied, I will destroy them as well."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Gu Qingfeng's domineering words and seeing his sharp-featured face, Xu Yulan was momentarily enchanted.</p><p></p><p>When she married Gu Qingfeng, it was out of a desire to repay a debt.</p><p></p><p>But as they spent time together, Xu Yulan discovered many indescribably alluring aspects about Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Especially this overbearing manner, which further drew her into his spell.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the aura of power around Gu Qingfeng...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the voice became more gentle.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you don't need to worry about these matters, I will handle the Gu family's problems myself. You just need to focus on resting and nurturing the fetus."</p><p></p><p>"Mm..."</p><p></p><p>—— </p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>The Tianyun Sect held a grand banquet, and many powerful factions were invited to attend. When Cloud Tianxing arrived, many people stood up to salute him.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Sect Master Cloud!"</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master Cloud has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Tianxing nodded to each of them, his face full of smiles.</p><p></p><p>When he reached the front of the banquet hall, looking at the powerful experts from various factions, Cloud Tianxing felt a surge of heroic spirit within him.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Gu family was dealt with, the Tianyun Sect would become the hegemon of the Baishi Dao.</p><p></p><p>The grand occasion of today would surely continue into the future.</p><p></p><p>"I'm delighted that all of you have come here, and I thank you all for giving face to the Tianyun Sect!" Cloud Tianxing spoke slowly, and the previous noisy voices gradually fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Then, his expression became solemn, and his voice grew louder.</p><p></p><p>"Recently, the Chu family and the Iron Bone Gang were destroyed without reason, and the Qin family was exterminated to the last. Gu Qingfeng's actions have already entered the demonic path, and such evil and malicious deeds are something that we, the people of the jianghu, cannot tolerate.</p><p></p><p>The one who was destroyed this time was the Qin family, and the next one to be destroyed could be the Tianyun Sect, or even those present here today.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the demonic deeds of the Gu family must be stopped. Today, I have summoned all of you to discuss how to deal with Gu Qingfeng—"</p><p></p><p>"Gu Qingfeng's ruthless and inhumane actions deserve death!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, such a ruthless method is undoubtedly the work of a demonic cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"Before the Gu family arrived, the Baishi Dao was peaceful, but after they came, there have been many disturbances. If they could destroy the Qin family today, they could target us tomorrow. The Gu family must not be allowed to remain!"</p><p></p><p>"Destroy the Gu family!"</p><p></p><p>"Destroy the Gu family!"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the crowd was in an excited frenzy.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the scene before him, Cloud Tianxing's eyes revealed a satisfied expression. As long as the emotions of the crowd were stirred up, dealing with the Gu family would become much easier.</p><p></p><p>Just then, there was a commotion outside the Tianyun Sect's mountain gate, and a black figure suddenly burst through the air, crashing onto a table with a loud thud, causing many people to change their expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to cause trouble in my Tianyun Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Tianxing was furious, but when he saw the middle-aged man in the green robe, his expression changed.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Qingfeng—"</p><p></p><p>Although he had not met Gu Qingfeng in person, he had seen the latter's portrait many times, so he was naturally not unfamiliar with him.</p><p></p><p>The others also changed their expressions when they heard the name "Gu Qingfeng."</p><p></p><p>No one had expected that while they were discussing how to deal with the Gu family, the Gu family's patriarch would come alone.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stood with his hands behind his back, his indifferent gaze sweeping across the crowd and finally resting on Cloud Tianxing.</p><p></p><p>"You all don't need to go through so much trouble to deal with me. Today, I, Gu, am here. Whoever wants to make a move, come at me, and I will fight to the end!"</p><p></p><p>These words caused the expressions of the crowd to change once again.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, someone could not hold back and angrily shouted, "Gu Qingfeng, don't be so arrogant! Old master will teach you a lesson!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, an old man rushed out from the crowd, his movements agile and swift like a monkey. In an instant, he had approached Gu Qingfeng, and a fierce gust of wind struck towards Gu Qingfeng's face.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression remained unchanged. He suddenly struck out with a punch, arriving before the other's attack, and his powerful force shattered the old man's hand. The exposed white bones pierced through the flesh and blood, causing the old man to let out a piercing scream.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Gu Qingfeng flicked his finger, and a gust of wind burst forth, instantly shattering the old man's head, silencing his agonizing cries.</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

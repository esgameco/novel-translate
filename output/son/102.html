        <h1>Chapter 102</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This is now Gu Qingfeng's attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>Perfect Skin Refining.</p><p>Perfect Blood Refining.</p><p></p><p>The breakthroughs in these two areas have directly broken through the limitations of the innate sect master, reaching the level comparable to a Qi Blood Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>If he were to perfect all aspects, Gu Qingfeng even suspects that his lifespan could exceed 1,000 years.</p><p></p><p>If he were to further break through to the Sect Master realm, his lifespan could even exceed 2,000 years.</p><p></p><p>"The lifespan of a Sorcerer at the Sovereign Spirit Realm is 800 years!"</p><p></p><p>"If I can perfect the Organ Refining, exceeding 800 years of lifespan will be no problem!"</p><p></p><p>"It is said that Sorcerers are superior to Warriors, precisely because Warriors have a shorter lifespan, but now, who can still say that Warriors are inferior to Sorcerers!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was resolute.</p><p></p><p>Although he has not yet perfected the Bone Refining, as long as he is given time, perfecting the Bone Refining will definitely not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>The reason why all martial artists cannot reach the perfect stage is that to truly perfect the physical body, one must cultivate many martial arts of the same level.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately,</p><p></p><p>Martial artists have a limited lifespan.</p><p></p><p>If one stays at a certain realm for too long, it is not a good thing for many people.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>This leads to a vicious cycle.</p><p></p><p>To cultivate a perfect physical body, one must have enough time, but martial artists often lack this time.</p><p></p><p>As a result,</p><p></p><p>It is almost impossible to cultivate a perfect physical body.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the benefits of a perfect physical body are not known to others, and if the goal is clear, who would be willing to try it.</p><p></p><p>But for an unknown result, who would be willing to waste time and let the years slip by.</p><p></p><p>After all, even for true geniuses, it takes a lot of time to cultivate multiple martial arts.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng is different.</p><p></p><p>He has an attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>As long as he has enough Upgrade Points, perfecting the physical body is not a problem.</p><p></p><p>And when he achieves a perfect physical body, Gu Qingfeng can create a perfect physical body martial art for his descendants to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' has broken through to the post-Blood Refining realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 50 Upgrade Points!"</p><p>"Reward: 50 Bone Refining Pills!"</p><p>"Reward: 20 Marrow Cleansing Pills!"</p><p></p><p>Another year has passed, and Gu Qingfeng looked at the refreshed information panel, only to see that Gu Yang had indeed broken through to the post-Blood Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>Regarding Gu Yang's breakthrough,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was not particularly surprised.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Yang had already broken through to the mid-Blood Refining realm three years ago, and his current entry into the post-Blood Refining realm was quite normal.</p><p></p><p>Fifty Upgrade Points.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had no reservations at all, putting them all into the Five Viscera Meridians.</p><p></p><p>At this point,</p><p></p><p>The Five Viscera Meridians were perfected.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's cultivation also soared to the fifth realm of Organ Refining, and the next step would be the Sect Master realm.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Having reached this level of cultivation, Gu Qingfeng was in no hurry to break through to the Sect Master realm. He had a premonition that if he could further refine his physical body before breaking through, he would become even more powerful after reaching the Sect Master realm.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng spent another half a year cultivating the Primordial Jade Mirror to the fifth layer of perfection.</p><p></p><p>At this time,</p><p></p><p>The two Organ Refining cultivation methods had both reached the perfected stage.</p><p></p><p>Only the remaining Scarlet Flame Divine Skill was still stuck at the third layer of perfection, unable to break through to the fourth layer.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng did not hesitate and directly allocated the remaining promotion points to the Crimson Flame Divine Art.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the Crimson Flame Divine Art also broke through to the fourth level of entry.</p><p></p><p>"Refined Impurity Realm Perfected!"</p><p></p><p>"Crimson Flame Divine Art Fourth Level of Entry!"</p><p></p><p>"Next, I will first raise the Crimson Flame Divine Art to the ninth level of perfection, and then cultivate other martial arts, striving to truly achieve the level of a perfect physical body--"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took a deep breath, already having an idea in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Xuan'er and Xiu'er are also about the same age, in a year or two they can start practicing martial arts. If the plan is feasible, then in the future I can have two more channels to obtain promotion points!"</p><p></p><p>The higher the cultivation, the more difficult it is to have offspring.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had been diligently sowing the seeds these past few years, but unfortunately, Xu Yulan's belly had remained motionless.</p><p></p><p>However, he was not discouraged, but quietly waited for the growth of Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu.</p><p></p><p>And this year, Gu Qingfeng was just turning forty years old.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>The jianghu was in turmoil, the world in chaos. It seemed to have nothing to do with the Gu Family Manor at all.</p><p></p><p>Even though Gu Qingfeng had broken through to the Refined Impurity Realm Perfected, he had no intention of coming out of seclusion, and continued to cultivate martial arts with great effort.</p><p></p><p>Under his painstaking cultivation over the years, the Tyrannical Saber Slash had also become increasingly profound, although it had not yet reached the Great Perfection stage, the Tyrannical Saber Dao had become much stronger than before.</p><p></p><p>In the Whetstone Hall, the aura of the blade was chilling. Gu Qingfeng seemed to have merged with the Whetstone Hall, and the Exorcising Saber on the rack in front of him also emanated an extremely powerful aura, as if they were connected to each other.</p><p></p><p>This was the result of the Blade Nurturing Technique.</p><p></p><p>Years of blade nurturing had made the Exorcising Saber become extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng paid no attention to these matters, he still cultivated daily as usual, and left the affairs of the manor to Gu Yang to handle.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>Soon, another year passed.</p><p></p><p>This year, Gu Qingfeng was forty-one years old.</p><p></p><p>And now the Gu Family Manor was in a state of alert, with everyone in the manor in a tense mood.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple - Zhong Lai was about to give birth.</p><p></p><p>A little over a year after their marriage, Zhong Lai had become pregnant, and now the time for her to give birth was approaching.</p><p></p><p>Outside the guest room, Gu Yang paced back and forth. At nineteen years old, he had taken over the affairs of the Gu Family Manor at an early age, so his appearance was very mature, without the childishness typical of his age.</p><p></p><p>However, the usually composed Gu Yang was now full of nervousness.</p><p></p><p>By his side, the graceful and elegant Xu Yulan comforted him: "Yangzi, why worry? Lai'niang is a martial artist, her physique is not weak. Giving birth should not be a big problem. You can rest assured."</p><p></p><p>"Mother's words are absolutely right!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Gu Yang forced a smile on his face, but the nervous expression never left.</p><p></p><p>It was his first time being a father, so it was impossible for him not to be anxious.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xu Yulan shook her head slightly and said no more.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

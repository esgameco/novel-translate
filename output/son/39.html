        <h1>Chapter 39</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hongjiang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The main army is stationed.</p><p></p><p>Inside the prefecture city, there is an atmosphere of solemnity and killing, but it also appears somewhat peaceful. Outside the prefecture city, the ground is littered with corpses, and severed limbs and bloodstains can be seen everywhere, turning the land red.</p><p></p><p>In the government office of the prefecture city, there is a middle-aged man with a square face, handling official matters. He is dressed in a black and gold robe, and there is an aura of solemn authority about him, indicating his high status.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, someone enters from outside and bows respectfully to the middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>"Hundred-Unit Commander Tian of the Black Mysterious Guard, pays respects to the King!"</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing looked up at the other person, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>Tian said, "There is an urgent message from Guangyang Prefecture in Taishan Commandery. Please take a look, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Tian handed over a secret letter.</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing opened the letter and quickly scanned through the contents.</p><p></p><p>"Why did this secret message take so long to reach me?"</p><p></p><p>His expression darkened slightly.</p><p></p><p>The content of the letter was several months old, and although Taishan Commandery was far from Danyang Commandery, it should not have taken this long.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a terrifying aura emanated from Pei Jing, and Tian immediately knelt down, his face full of trepidation.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, please forgive me. The information blockade in Taishan Commandery was extremely severe, and many of my Black Mysterious Guard were lost there, so the news was delayed in reaching you. Please have mercy!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the terrifying aura around Pei Jing receded, but his eyes remained cold.</p><p></p><p>"Taishan Commandery... After I have dealt with the matters in Danyang Commandery, they will have their time to suffer. As for Luo Yu, he is just dead, a minor Blood Refining cultivator who thought he could impress me, but ultimately he was just mud that couldn't be lifted.</p><p></p><p>As for this Gu Qingfeng mentioned in the letter, his methods seem quite impressive, and he is not too old, so he has potential for the future. </p><p></p><p>You will go to Guangyang Prefecture and represent me to recruit him into my Divine Martial Army!"</p><p></p><p>"What if Gu Qingfeng refuses?"</p><p></p><p>"If he refuses... then find someone else who is willing to take charge of the Baishi Dao!"</p><p></p><p>With a simple sentence, Pei Jing had already decided the fate of the Baishi Dao.</p><p></p><p>Tian did not find this strange at all. After all, the one before him was the Divine Martial King, commanding hundreds of thousands of troops and ruling over several commanderies. A small Baishi Dao was nothing to him.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Tian took his leave as instructed.</p><p></p><p>The candlelight flickered, casting Pei Jing's face in an alternating light and shadow. His previously indifferent expression had now turned gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"Danyang Commandery... Hmph, I want to see how long you can hold out against me!"</p><p></p><p>"This world has already decayed and must be overthrown to establish a new order!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, someone entered from outside.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the newcomer, Pei Jing's expression returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Duan, what brings you here?"</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Divine Martial King. My Tianyang Sword Sect has received news that the court has made a move, and it seems the people from the Bureau of Demon Subduing have arrived in Danyang Commandery. This is a grave matter!"</p><p></p><p>"The Bureau of Demon Subduing..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this name, Pei Jing's gaze narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know who specifically has come from the Bureau of Demon Subduing?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard it is a Thousand-Unit Commander. The Thousand-Unit Commanders of the Bureau of Demon Subduing are not to be underestimated. At the very least, they have reached the Fusion Spirit realm of cultivation, and if they have advanced further, it will be even more troublesome."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I have already notified the sect, and an elder is willing to lend a hand, but we need to prepare the flesh and blood of a thousand people first!" </p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Pei Jing calmly said, "If an elder is willing to lend a hand, that would be wonderful. The matter of a thousand people's flesh and blood is just a small problem, merely an affair of war.</p><p></p><p>If the Tianyang Sword Sect can assist my King in conquering the Danyang Prefecture within three years, I can offer another hundred thousand people!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, I will convey your words to the elder. Moreover, other elders from the sect are also arriving one by one. This time, the Exorcism Manor is just the beginning. Behind the Danyang Prefecture's governor, there are many sects providing support. </p><p></p><p>However, these sects are nothing to my Tianyang Sword Sect. With our assistance, your day of ascending the throne draws near, my King!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Elder Duan, for your kind words. If I can indeed sit on that position, the Tianyang Sword Sect shall become the national religion, and I will not forget your meritorious service."</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing's words made the other party's smile grow even brighter.</p><p></p><p>In Taishan Prefecture, Guangyang Prefecture, on the White Stone Path - </p><p></p><p>Inside the Gu family, Gu Qingfeng was completely submerged in a medicinal tub. The medicinal bath was part of the Tempering Bone Soup formula, which required both internal and external use.</p><p></p><p>As Gu Qingfeng was immersed in the medicinal bath, he felt a scorching force pierce through his pores and enter his body, akin to a steel blade scraping his bones, bringing unbearable agony.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng let out a muffled groan, his expression slightly ferocious, but he endured the excruciating pain and then proceeded to consume the prepared medicinal soup.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Terrifying energy erupted from his abdomen. The two forces, from within and without, combined, continuously cleansing Gu Qingfeng's flesh and entering his bones, beginning to refine and purge any impurities.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the power of the Scorching Yang Palm was also activated, accelerating the refinement of his bones under the guidance of the medicinal power.</p><p></p><p>Bone Refining Realm! Refining his entire skeletal structure!</p><p></p><p>In Gu Qingfeng's previous life, the human body had 206 bones, but in this world, the human body has 365 bones, corresponding to the number of days in a year.</p><p></p><p>To enter the Bone Refining Realm, one must refine all 365 bones in the body, only then can they truly achieve a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>However, refining the bones is no easy task. Reaching the Blood Refining Realm is already difficult, let alone refining 365 bones.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, refining the bones must be done with the utmost care. The slightest mistake could lead to severe consequences.</p><p></p><p>If one possesses a high-grade martial art, it would contain the true method for entering the Bone Refining Realm, allowing one to avoid these problems. But without such a martial art, relying solely on one's own exploration and breakthrough, the dangers would increase exponentially.</p><p></p><p>The so-called cultivation methods are the result of countless predecessors paying a heavy price to gradually uncover them. Those who come after must either rely on the legacy left behind, or emulate their predecessors and forge their own path, but the latter option carries far greater risks, and people will only resort to it when absolutely necessary.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Gu Qingfeng does not possess a high-grade martial art. However, the Scorching Yang Palm he cultivates does involve the realm of bone refinement. When the Scorching Yang Palm reaches perfection, its palm energy will circulate through the 365 bones, imbuing them with power.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's task now is to rely on the path of the Scorching Yang Palm's energy, and use it to refine his bones, so that he can quickly enter the Bone Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

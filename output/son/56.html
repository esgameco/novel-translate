        <h1>Chapter 56</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This old man will certainly be able to advance further!" </p><p></p><p>The Elder of the Azure Yang Sect had a ferocious expression, his eyes emitting a green glow, his entire being like an evil ghost that had crawled out of hell, his shadow on the ground twisting and turning in a bizarre manner.</p><p></p><p>In the next breath, the figure of the Elder of the Azure Yang Sect vanished from the original spot.</p><p></p><p>Almost at the same time, Gu Qingfeng only felt a fierce wind blowing towards him, as the Elder of the Azure Yang Sect had turned into a faint shadow, his speed reaching the extreme.</p><p></p><p>However, faced with such an attack, Gu Qingfeng was not afraid at all.</p><p></p><p>His physical body trembled. </p><p></p><p>His surging blood qi was like a raging river, or like the proud sun rising high in the sky. His palms gathered a terrifying and scorching palm force and struck towards the Elder of the Azure Yang Sect.</p><p></p><p>In less than a breath, the two had exchanged dozens of moves.</p><p></p><p>With each collision, Gu Qingfeng felt a strange and icy aura entering his body through the palms of his hands, trying to freeze and devour his flesh and blood, but it was quickly dispersed by the scorching blood force.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the Elder of the Azure Yang Sect was also not doing well.</p><p></p><p>He found that Gu Qingfeng's blood qi was terrifyingly strong, much more powerful than an ordinary Xiu Shu Realm cultivator, and his blood qi even contained an extremely scorching aura, completely conflicting with the sorcerer's power he had cultivated.</p><p></p><p>When the sorcerer's power invaded the other's body, this scorching power also entered his own body.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the Elder of the Azure Yang Sect's expression looked unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the shadows on the ground suddenly erupted, countless black shadows like sharp swords piercing through the air, attacking Gu Qingfeng's vital points.</p><p></p><p>The latter, as if he had anticipated it, unleashed his protective spirit qi again, and all the shadow attacks were isolated by the protective spirit qi, but these shadow attacks were particularly strange and powerful, and even with the strength of the protective spirit qi, it could not withstand for more than a few breaths before it was shattered.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Qingfeng's eyes turned cold, and his palms frantically struck out, unleashing his terrifying blood qi power, which, when colliding with the shadows, instantly dispersed and dissipated them like spring sunshine melting snow.</p><p></p><p>However, there were still shadows that broke through the blockade and directly pierced Gu Qingfeng's arm. The skin that could withstand the Lian Gu Quan's perfect attack was now completely defenseless.</p><p></p><p>The skin was broken open, and Gu Qingfeng could feel his flesh and blood being gradually devoured.</p><p></p><p>He directly grabbed the shadow with his right hand, activating the scorching Yang Palm Force, and the shadow that was originally devouring his flesh and blood was instantly severed, and Gu Qingfeng seemed to even hear a piercing scream.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was ferocious, and in the next breath, he charged directly towards the Elder of the Azure Yang Sect.</p><p></p><p>This fierce momentum made the latter's expression suddenly change.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the Elder of the Azure Yang Sect also had a ruthless expression, and strange powers erupted from his body, the terrifying shadows under the sun's glare seemed to be magnified, twisting and struggling like evil ghosts in hell.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Elder of the Azure Yang Sect's previously plump skin suddenly shriveled, his eye sockets gradually sunken, his ten fingers' nails becoming long and sharp, his entire being transforming into a hellish evil ghost.</p><p></p><p>"This old man will devour you!!"</p><p></p><p>The Elder of the Azure Yang Sect let out a roar and engaged in battle with Gu Qingfeng again.</p><p></p><p>This bizarre scene was witnessed by the Azure Yang Sect and the Gu family, and many disciples of the Azure Yang Sect were shocked, seemingly not expecting such a strange existence in their sect.</p><p></p><p>As for the Gu family side, they were also equally shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the 'Refining Evil into the Body' that Father mentioned?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at the Elder of the Azure Yang Sect, who had become like a hellish evil ghost, completely unlike a normal person, and his heart was also...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was a chill that ran down one's spine.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>The powerful cultivators of the Qingyang Sect had already been mostly slain by Gu Qingfeng, and the remaining disciples of the Qingyang Sect were roughly on par with the Gu family in overall strength, with both sides now engaged in a brutal battle.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang glanced at the battlefield where Gu Qingfeng was, then turned his attention back to fighting the Blood Refining Realm cultivator from the Qingyang Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family's fist techniques had been practiced to perfection in his hands, and he had also gained some insights into the mysterious Scorching Sun Divine Palm. With the nourishment of the Blood Refining Elixir, Gu Yang, though only at the initial stage of Blood Refining, had a solid foundation that allowed him to rival the powerful cultivators at the later stages of Blood Refining.</p><p></p><p>His opponent was a mid-stage Blood Refining Realm expert from the Qingyang Sect.</p><p></p><p>Initially, the opponent had looked down on Gu Yang because of his young age, and had wanted to subdue him directly, but unexpectedly, they had met their match.</p><p></p><p>Now, facing Gu Yang's fierce offensive, the opponent could only lament inwardly.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng and the Qingyang Sect's Patriarch had become mere shadows, both of them unleashing their full power.</p><p></p><p>The shadows on the ground twisted and distorted, breaking through Gu Qingfeng's protective aura and leaving deep wounds on his body.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Qingfeng paid no heed to these injuries, his eyes fixed solely on the Qingyang Patriarch, his relentless attacks not diminishing in the slightest, putting immense pressure on the opponent.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>After another brief exchange, Gu Qingfeng seized an opening and struck the Qingyang Patriarch's chest with full force, the terrifying power capable of shattering mountains instantly caving in the opponent's chest.</p><p></p><p>The internal organs were instantly ruptured under such tremendous force.</p><p></p><p>The Qingyang Patriarch coughed up blood mixed with shredded viscera.</p><p></p><p>Such an injury.</p><p></p><p>If it had befallen an ordinary cultivator, they would have already perished. But as a Sorcerer, the Patriarch's life force was exceptionally strong, and even with such a fatal wound, he could still cling to life.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, the Qingyang Patriarch's gaze towards Gu Qingfeng finally turned to one of fear, sensing the aura of death from Gu Qingfeng's blood-soaked, unyielding form.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the Qingyang Patriarch turned and fled.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, a cold, savage smile appeared on Gu Qingfeng's bloodied face.</p><p></p><p>"Too late to think of running now!"</p><p></p><p>The moment the Qingyang Patriarch turned to flee, Gu Qingfeng had already closed the distance, striking him in the back with another palm. The Scorching Sun Palm energy invaded the Patriarch's body, detonating the hidden Scorching Sun Palm energy within him.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The Scorching Sun Palm energy exploded.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh!!!"</p><p></p><p>The searing energy shattered his meridians and bones, and the Qingyang Patriarch let out a piercing, agonized scream.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Gu Qingfeng grabbed the Patriarch's head and slammed it down onto the ground with tremendous force.</p><p></p><p>Boom--</p><p></p><p>The ground caved in, the rocks shattered. The Patriarch's skull seemed to crack under the immense power, his face covered in blood, his sunken eye sockets and withered body making him appear even more grotesque.</p><p></p><p>"No... you can't kill me, if I die, the evil entity within me will awaken, and you will all perish!"</p><p></p><p>The fear of death made the Qingyang Patriarch disregard everything else, desperately pleading for his life.</p><p></p><p>To this, Gu Qingfeng actually paused.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, a glimmer of hope appeared in the Qingyang Patriarch's eyes.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

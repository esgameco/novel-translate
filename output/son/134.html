        <h1>Chapter 134</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Seven Killing Blade Technique was originally a military martial art, mastered by powerful warriors on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng had cultivated the Seven Killing Blade Technique to its pinnacle, surpassing the limits of previous masters who created this blade technique, he still gained new insights upon witnessing the true carnage of the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Blood sprayed.</p><p></p><p>Life after life was reaped.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng attained a completely new understanding of the Seven Killing Blade Technique, as the true essence of slaughter seemed to grow stronger with the massive loss of lives, gradually transforming him to an even higher level.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>"Surround and slay this fellow!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Qingfeng cutting through the hundred-thousand-strong army as if entering a realm with no one, Pei Jing's expression immediately turned grim. He directly ordered the troops to surround and slay Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was a Grand Master, so what?</p><p>Grand Masters are still human, and they too have their limits.</p><p></p><p>As long as they could confine him and exhaust his strength, then with the powerful elite warriors they had, slaying a Grand Master was not impossible.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Pei Jing was well aware that the chances were low.</p><p>After all, while Grand Masters were human, if they were truly determined to leave, without an equally powerful expert to restrain them, even a hundred-thousand-strong army would be hard-pressed to stop them.</p><p></p><p>But now, </p><p>Pei Jing could only go all-out to surround and slay him.</p><p>The threat posed by this suspected Grand Master was simply too great.</p><p>As long as Gu Qingfeng did not die, Pei Jing would have no peace.</p><p></p><p>"I request the two Elders to lend a hand, and coordinate with the army to surround and slay this fellow!" </p><p>Pei Jing looked at the two Elders of the Tianyang Sword Sect beside him and spoke.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the expressions of the two Elders fluctuated, as if they were pondering something.</p><p></p><p>After a moment,</p><p>Cui Mingfeng took a deep breath and nodded slightly: "This suspected Grand Master is indeed a grave threat. Currently, he has arrogantly immersed himself deep within our army. As long as we don't let him escape, we may still have a chance to slay him!"</p><p></p><p>After witnessing Gu Qingfeng's strength, Cui Mingfeng's first thought was to run.</p><p>The power of a suspected Grand Master was truly terrifying.</p><p>But upon seeing Gu Qingfeng trapped in the army's encirclement, Cui Mingfeng had a different idea.</p><p></p><p>It was still the same - Grand Masters are human.</p><p>As long as they are human, they can die.</p><p></p><p>Throughout history, cases of Grand Masters being surrounded and slain were few and far between. Without experts of the same level, it would require an immense price to achieve.</p><p>However, </p><p>although such cases were rare, there was still a slim chance of success.</p><p>Furthermore, the vitality of a Grand Master also secretly stirred Cui Mingfeng's ambition.</p><p></p><p>He had been stuck at the peak of the Fusion Spirit Realm for years, and to break through to the Transformation Realm, he needed favorable opportunities.</p><p>For ordinary mortals, even sacrificing millions of lives might not be enough to succeed in that breakthrough.</p><p>But if he could consume a Grand Master, the probability of breaking through to the Transformation Realm would be greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>It was simple.</p><p>The level of a Grand Master's life was incomparable to that of ordinary people.</p><p>Even a single drop of their blood contained boundless profundity.</p><p></p><p>Cui Mingfeng thought this way, and so did Laoqu. The two exchanged a glance, seeing the same longing in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p>the army continued their assault.</p><p>Gu Qingfeng was still cutting through them as if entering a realm with no one.</p><p>The Demon-Slaying Blade was dyed in endless blood, turning a deep crimson.</p><p></p><p>As for this,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng paid no heed, for he was now immersed in a profound state, his aura of slaughter becoming increasingly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng swung his blade towards the front, the terrifying power surging like a tidal wave.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The true meaning of the massacre suddenly erupted, the bloody blade light broke through ten zhang, and all the soldiers it touched were cut in half by this single stroke. "Breakthrough!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p><p></p><p>Just now.</p><p></p><p>His Seven Killing Sword Technique had another breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>The true meaning of the massacre had directly advanced from the second level to the third level.</p><p></p><p>The breakthrough of the third-level true meaning of the massacre made Gu Qingfeng's strength progress a little further. He glanced at the seemingly endless army around him, and then looked towards the direction of the main camp where Pei Jing was, and no longer continued to entangle, using the Zhu Xie Blade to clear the way and head towards the direction where the Divine Martial King was.</p><p></p><p>"Stop him!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Qingfeng rushing towards him, Pei Jing's expression became even more unsightly.</p><p></p><p>At this time.</p><p></p><p>Without Pei Jing needing to speak, Cui Mingfeng and Zuoqiu both made their move at the same time, rushing towards Gu Qingfeng in the midst of the army.</p><p></p><p>If it was a one-on-one confrontation, they would not have the courage to attack Gu Qingfeng, but now that the other party was deeply entangled in the chaotic army, it was different.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng swung his blade, directly splitting one person in half.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to take the next step, two strange and icy forces attacked him.</p><p></p><p>Immediately.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng activated his Qiangqi protective aura.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The two attacks landed on the Qiangqi protective aura, only causing it to crack slightly, without truly shattering it.</p><p></p><p>This scene.</p><p></p><p>Caused Cui Mingfeng and Zuoqiu to be greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>They were clear about Gu Qingfeng's terrifying strength, but they never imagined that even with their full-force attacks, they could not break through his Qiangqi protective aura.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the first attack did not have any effect, the two of them prepared to retreat.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to withdraw, Gu Qingfeng's aura had already locked onto one of them, and the true meaning of the Hegemon Blade erupted, the terrifying power of the true meaning seemed like a divine sword descending from the heavens, making Zuoqiu feel as if he had fallen into an icy abyss.</p><p></p><p>"No—"</p><p></p><p>Zuoqiu's expression was filled with terror, he struggled desperately, but found that under the suppression of such true meaning, his body could not move at all.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment.</p><p></p><p>The long blade suddenly descended.</p><p></p><p>Zuoqiu's body was abruptly split in two, and blood spilled onto the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The sorcerer perished.</p><p></p><p>The evil entity revived.</p><p></p><p>A hideous and terrifying evil entity emerged from Zuoqiu's corpse, and the first thing it did was not to devour Zuoqiu's body, but to attack the surrounding soldiers.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>This evil entity also seemed to be able to sense Gu Qingfeng's terrifying power, and did not dare to attack him.</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also ignored the emerged evil entity, and after killing Zuoqiu, his aura was constantly locked onto Cui Mingfeng, and all the obstructers along the way were slaughtered by his blade.</p><p></p><p>In less than a moment.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had already arrived behind Cui Mingfeng.</p><p></p><p>The latter felt the fierce and domineering aura, his face turned deathly pale, and he didn't even dare to turn back and look.</p><p></p><p>Run! This was Cui Mingfeng's only thought.</p><p></p><p>The terribleness of a Grand Master made him deeply despair, and the ridiculous idea of devouring a Grand Master had now disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Cui Mingfeng suddenly felt a chill on his neck, and then everything spun, and he saw a rather familiar headless corpse.</p><p></p><p>Before his consciousness faded, he suddenly had an epiphany.</p><p></p><p>"This is my body!"</p><p></p><p>—</p><p></p><p>PS: I'll update the second chapter a little later, and it won't be late tomorrow, I'll resume normal updates!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

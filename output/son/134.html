        <h1>Chapter 134</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Seven Killing Blade Technique was originally a military martial art, mastered by powerful warriors on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng had already cultivated the Seven Killing Blade Technique to its pinnacle, surpassing the limits of the previous masters who created this blade technique, he still had a unique realization upon witnessing the true carnage of the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Blood spraying.</p><p></p><p>Lives being reaped one after another.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng gained a brand-new understanding of the Seven Killing Blade Technique, as if the true essence of slaughter was amplified by the massive loss of life, gradually transforming him to an even higher level.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>"Surround and eliminate this fellow!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Qingfeng cutting through the hundred-thousand-strong army as if entering a realm with no one in it, Pei Jing's expression immediately turned grim. He directly ordered the troops to surround and eliminate Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was a Grand Master, so what?</p><p>Grand Masters are still human, and they too have their limits.</p><p></p><p>As long as they could confine him and exhaust his entire strength, then with the powerful elite troops they had, it was not impossible to slay a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Pei Jing was well aware that the chances were low.</p><p>After all, while Grand Masters were still human, for a cultivator of that level, if they were truly determined to escape, without an opponent of equal standing to restrain them, even a hundred-thousand-strong army might not be able to hold them back.</p><p></p><p>But now, Pei Jing could only go all-out to surround and eliminate Gu Qingfeng.</p><p>The threat posed by a suspected Grand Master was simply too great.</p><p>As long as Gu Qingfeng did not die, Pei Jing would have no peace.</p><p></p><p>"I request that the two Elders lend a hand and coordinate with the army to surround and eliminate this fellow!" Pei Jing said, looking at the two Elders of the Tian Yang Sword Sect standing beside him.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the expressions of the two Elders fluctuated, as if they were pondering something.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Cui Mingfeng took a deep breath and nodded slightly: "A suspected Grand Master-level cultivator is indeed a grave threat. Currently, this person has arrogantly immersed himself deep within our army, and as long as we don't let him escape, we may still have a chance to slay him!"</p><p></p><p>After witnessing Gu Qingfeng's strength, Cui Mingfeng's first thought was to run.</p><p>The power of a suspected Grand Master-level cultivator was truly terrifying.</p><p>But upon seeing Gu Qingfeng trapped in the army's encirclement, Cui Mingfeng had a different idea.</p><p></p><p>It was still the same saying: Grand Masters are also human.</p><p>As long as they are human, they can die.</p><p></p><p>Throughout history, cases of Grand Masters being surrounded and killed were few and far between, and it would require an immense price to pay without the intervention of an opponent of equal standing.</p><p>However, although such cases were rare, there was still a slim chance of success.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the vitality of a Grand Master also secretly ignited Cui Mingfeng's ambition.</p><p>He had been stuck at the peak of the Fusion Spirit Realm for many years, and to break through to the Transformation Realm, he needed favorable opportunities.</p><p>For ordinary mortals, even sacrificing millions of lives might not be enough to succeed in the breakthrough to the Transformation Realm.</p><p>But if he could consume a Grand Master, the chances of breaking through would be greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>It was simple.</p><p>The level of a Grand Master's life was incomparable to that of ordinary people.</p><p>Even a single drop of their blood contained boundless mysteries.</p><p></p><p>Cui Mingfeng had such thoughts, and Li Qiu also shared the same idea. The two exchanged a glance, seeing the same longing in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the army continued to surround and attack.</p><p>Gu Qingfeng was still cutting through them as if entering a realm with no one in it.</p><p>The Demon-Slaying Blade was now dyed in endless blood, turning a deep crimson.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng paid no heed to this, as he was currently immersed in a profound state, his aura of slaughter becoming increasingly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Gu Qingfeng swung his blade forward, and the terrifying power surged forth like a tidal wave.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The true meaning of the massacre suddenly erupted, the bloody blade light broke through ten zhang, and all the soldiers it touched were cut in half by this single stroke. "We've broken through!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p><p></p><p>Just now.</p><p></p><p>His Seven Killing Sword Technique had made another breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>The true meaning of the massacre had directly advanced from the second level to the third level.</p><p></p><p>The breakthrough of the third-level true meaning of the massacre made Gu Qingfeng's strength progress a little further. He glanced at the seemingly endless army around him, and then looked towards the direction of the main camp where Pei Jing was, and no longer continued to entangle, using the Zhu Xie Sword to clear the way and head towards the direction where the Divine Martial King was.</p><p></p><p>"Stop him!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Qingfeng rushing towards him, Pei Jing's expression became even uglier.</p><p></p><p>At this time.</p><p></p><p>Without Pei Jing needing to speak, Cui Mingfeng and Zuoqiu both made their move at the same time, attacking Gu Qingfeng in the midst of the army.</p><p></p><p>If it was a one-on-one confrontation, they would not have the courage to attack Gu Qingfeng, but now that the other party was deeply entangled in the chaos of the army, it was different.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng swung his sword, directly splitting one person in half.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to take the next step, two strange and icy forces attacked him.</p><p></p><p>Immediately.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng activated his Qiangqi protective shield.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The two attacks landed on the Qiangqi protective shield, only causing the shield to crack slightly, without truly shattering it.</p><p></p><p>This scene.</p><p></p><p>Shocked Cui Mingfeng and Zuoqiu.</p><p></p><p>They were clear about Gu Qingfeng's terrifying strength, but they never imagined that even with their full force of attack, they couldn't break through his Qiangqi protective shield.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the first attack was ineffective, the two of them prepared to retreat.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to withdraw, Gu Qingfeng's aura had already locked onto one of them, and the true meaning of the Heba Sword suddenly erupted, the terrifying power of the true meaning seemed like a divine sword that flashed into their eyes, making Zuoqiu feel as if he had fallen into an icy abyss.</p><p></p><p>"No—"</p><p></p><p>Zuoqiu's expression was filled with horrified panic, he struggled desperately, but found that under the suppression of such true meaning, his body could not move at all.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment.</p><p></p><p>The long sword suddenly descended.</p><p></p><p>Zuoqiu's body was abruptly split in two, and blood spattered on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The sorcerer perished.</p><p></p><p>The evil spirit revived.</p><p></p><p>A hideous and terrifying evil spirit emerged from Zuoqiu's corpse, and the first thing it did was not to devour Zuoqiu's body, but to attack the surrounding soldiers.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>This evil spirit also seemed to be able to sense Gu Qingfeng's terribleness and did not dare to attack him.</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also ignored the emerged evil spirit, and after killing Zuoqiu, his aura was constantly locked onto Cui Mingfeng, and all the obstructers along the way were slaughtered by his sword.</p><p></p><p>In less than a moment.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had already arrived behind Cui Mingfeng.</p><p></p><p>The latter felt the fierce and domineering aura, his face turned deathly pale, and he didn't even dare to look back.</p><p></p><p>Run! This was Cui Mingfeng's only thought.</p><p></p><p>The terribleness of a Grand Master made him deeply despair, and the ridiculous idea of devouring a Grand Master had now disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Cui Mingfeng suddenly felt a chill on his neck, and then everything spun, and he saw a rather familiar headless corpse.</p><p></p><p>Before his consciousness faded, he suddenly had an epiphany.</p><p></p><p>"This is my body!"</p><p></p><p>—</p><p></p><p>PS: I'll update the second chapter later, and it won't be late tomorrow, I'll resume normal updates!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

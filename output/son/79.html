        <h1>Chapter 79</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +30 Upgrade Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 40 Bone Refining Elixirs!"  </p><p></p><p>"Reward: 10 Marrow Cleansing Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: Secret Technique 'Sword Nurturing Art'!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was originally contemplating the true meaning of the Sect Master's techniques, when suddenly he saw the prompts on the information panel, his expression changing slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, he has broken through!"</p><p></p><p>Regarding Gu Yang's breakthrough, Gu Qingfeng was somewhat surprised, but also felt it was within reason.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Gu Yang had been almost recklessly killing in the White Stone Dao, with all invading enemies being slain by his blade. In such life-and-death tempering, his martial dao could advance greatly.</p><p></p><p>So, Gu Yang's breakthrough was quite normal.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Gu Qingfeng took a look at his own attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng   Age: 36/200   Realm: Refining Viscera First Realm</p><p></p><p>Martial Arts: Gu Family Fist (Unbreakable First Level), Iron Body Technique (Iron Body First Level), Great Slab Slamming Palm (Perfected), Iron Leg Skill (Perfected), Refining Iron Finger (Perfected), Scorching Sun Divine Palm (Scorching Sun Palm Strength Fourth Level), Heaven Thunder Sword Technique (Initiate), Hundred Temperings Golden Body (Golden Indestructible Ninth Level), Seven Killing Blade Art (Killing Intent Second Level), Heaven Canopy Invincible Body (Protective Qi Fourth Level), Heaven Canopy Divine Body (Indestructible Divine Body First Level), Azure Yang Technique (Second Layer Mastery, Pure Yang Qi and Blood First Level), Five Viscera Classic (First Layer, Five Viscera Like Gods First Level), Chaos Origin Precious Mirror (Not Initiated)   Upgrade Points: 30...</p><p></p><p>In recent days, Gu Qingfeng had been cultivating the Azure Yang Technique and the Five Viscera Classic.</p><p></p><p>The former needs no further explanation.</p><p></p><p>As for the latter, this Viscera Refining martial art is different from ordinary martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The Five Viscera Classic is divided into five layers, and the prerequisite for cultivation is to have perfected Marrow Cleansing.</p><p></p><p>Very simple.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the previous cultivation methods for Viscera Refining did not even record the Five Viscera Classic.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the Five Viscera Classic is also different from other martial arts, as although it is divided into five layers, there is no distinction between minor and great accomplishment. Each time a viscera is tempered, one can step into the next realm.</p><p></p><p>When the Five Viscera are cultivated, the Five Viscera Classic can be perfected.</p><p></p><p>Because Gu Qingfeng had already tempered his heart earlier, the cultivation of the Five Viscera Classic was also easy, and he smoothly entered the first layer.</p><p></p><p>And when the first layer of the Five Viscera Classic was cultivated, Gu Qingfeng could also feel that his heart had undergone some subtle changes, becoming stronger than before.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, while the first layer of the Five Viscera Classic was easy to cultivate, Gu Qingfeng had not yet grasped the threshold for the second layer.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't be helped.</p><p></p><p>One layer corresponds to one viscera.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to cultivate it is not as simple as that.</p><p></p><p>However, with Gu Yang's breakthrough now, the reward of upgrade points could allow Gu Qingfeng to bypass a lot of effort.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Gu Qingfeng immediately consumed 20 upgrade points to advance the Five Viscera Classic to the second layer.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a flood of memories surged forth. A mysterious power erupted from within his body and automatically merged into one of the viscera.</p><p></p><p>The internal organ was tempered. Gu Qingfeng only felt his qi and blood become even more surging.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, the second layer of the Five Viscera Classic was cultivated.</p><p></p><p>And at the moment the second layer of the Five Viscera Classic was cultivated, there was a mysterious spiritual connection with the heart, with them communicating with each other. The surging qi and blood flowed through Gu Qingfeng's entire body like a raging river.</p><p></p><p>The powerful strength revived from within his flesh, and Gu Qingfeng opened his eyes, exhaling a turbid breath, like rumbling thunder and howling wind.</p><p></p><p>"Lung Cultivated!"</p><p>"Exhaling like Thunder!"</p><p>"Good, good, good, the Viscera Refining martial artist is indeed a step-by-step ascent, like..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Now that I have entered the second realm of Refining the Impure, my strength is at least 50% more powerful than before!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes shone with a brilliant light.</p><p></p><p>Breakthrough in strength.</p><p></p><p>This brought about even greater confidence.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Qingfeng looked at the remaining 10 points of advancement and immediately used them to further upgrade the Azure Yang Technique.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Consumed 2 advancement points, the Azure Yang Technique broke through to the third layer!...</p><p></p><p>Consumed 2 advancement points, the Azure Yang Technique broke through to the fourth layer!...</p><p></p><p>Consumed 2 advancement points, the Azure Yang Technique broke through to the fifth layer!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In less than a moment, </p><p>Gu Qingfeng had upgraded the Azure Yang Technique from the second layer to the fifth layer.</p><p></p><p>This step</p><p>allowed the Azure Yang Technique to be cultivated to the Refining the Blood realm's perfection, and going forward, it would break through to an even higher Refining the Bone level.</p><p></p><p>The five layers of the Azure Yang Technique</p><p>caused the pure Yang Qi and blood flowing within his physical body to also break through to the fourth level.</p><p></p><p>As a result,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng's pure Yang Qi and blood had become even more powerful, although this change was still negligible compared to his current strength.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p>the cultivation of martial arts relies on gradual accumulation.</p><p></p><p>Even if a martial art can only increase one's strength by 1%, when combined with hundreds of other martial arts, it can raise one's level to an astonishing degree.</p><p></p><p>Quantitative change</p><p>will ultimately lead to qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p>"It's a pity I'm short by one point, otherwise the Azure Yang Technique could have been upgraded to the sixth layer!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the remaining 4 advancement points and shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Advancing to the Refining the Blood realm requires 2 points.</p><p>Advancing to the Refining the Bone realm requires 5 points.</p><p>Going further, </p><p>Refining the Marrow requires 10 points, and Refining the Impure requires 20 points.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to the advancement points needed to break through the limit, the consumption for normal martial arts advancement is significantly less.</p><p></p><p>After all, the initial breakthrough of the Heavenly Demon Body required 40 advancement points, and that was just to allow him to break through to the first realm of Refining the Impure. If he wanted to break through to the second realm of Refining the Impure, it would require 80 advancement points.</p><p></p><p>In comparison,</p><p>with a complete Refining the Impure martial art, the total advancement points needed from Refining the Marrow's perfection to Refining the Impure's perfection would only be around 100 points.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not regret wasting advancement points on his previous breakthrough.</p><p>If he had not broken through to the Refining the Impure realm, he might not have been able to intimidate the people of the Exorcism Pavilion back then.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p>rather than keeping the resources, it is more useful to immediately convert them into strength.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p>when Gu Qingfeng looked at the Patriarch's True Intent diagram again, various insights emerged in his mind, and the image of the mountain-cleaving sword strike reappeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Many realizations surged into his heart at this moment, as his previous accumulations were finally able to complete the last step of transformation.</p><p></p><p>After a long while,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng withdrew his gaze from the Patriarch's True Intent diagram and revealed a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Tyrannical Sword Slash!"</p><p>"So this is the Tyrannical Sword Slash!"</p><p>"This time, it's a double blessing!!"</p><p></p><p>Not only did he achieve a cultivation breakthrough, but he also seized the opportune moment of enlightenment to directly comprehend the complete Tyrannical Sword Slash.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng finally truly understood the power of the Patriarch's supreme technique.</p><p></p><p>Immediately,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>On it, the information of the Tyrannical Sword Slash was clearly displayed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Tyrannical Sword Slash (Beginner, Tyrannical Sword True Intent Level 6)!...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

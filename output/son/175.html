        <h1>Chapter 175</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Demonic Buddha has fallen!"</p><p></p><p>At the Liuyun Manor, Gu Yang had just led a large army to suppress this place, when he received a message from the Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The existence of the Demonic Buddha had been a thorn in his side, a constant threat.</p><p></p><p>Alas, the Demonic Buddha was too powerful, and Gu Yang had no way to resolve it.</p><p></p><p>Now that Gu Qingfeng had taken action and slain the Demonic Buddha, this major problem had been solved.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at the person in front of him and said with a slight smile: "I heard that when the Demonic Buddha of the Nine Turns Path emerged, the Zhenxie Directorate of the Great Xuanwang Dynasty had also dispatched powerful experts to enter and subdue it.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, that battle resulted in the Zhenxie Directorate's crushing defeat, with almost all the powerful experts who entered the Nine Turns Path perishing, I wonder if this is true or not?"</p><p></p><p>Sitting before him</p><p></p><p>was the current Prefect of Taishan, Taishi Yi.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Taishi Yi revealed a humble expression: "Senior Hegemon Blade's mastery of the Dao is heavenly, naturally not something the ordinary Zhenxie Directorate could match. With Your Majesty having Senior Hegemon Blade's support, you will surely be able to contend for the rule of the world one day!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Gu Yang's expression remained unchanged, but he gave Taishi Yi a deep look.</p><p></p><p>After a long while,</p><p></p><p>he slowly said, "I have seen the sincerity of the Prefect. I am greatly pleased that you have abandoned the dark and embraced the light. From this day on, you shall be the Prefect of Qingjiang Prefecture, responsible for managing all affairs of Qingjiang Prefecture on my behalf."</p><p></p><p>"However, remember that I do not tolerate demonic calamities or the mischief of monsters. Prefect Taishi, do not disappoint me!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Taishi Yi's heart immediately felt relieved, and his face lit up with joy.</p><p></p><p>"I thank Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>Prefect of Qingjiang Prefecture! This position may seem lower than his previous one as Prefect of Taishan.</p><p></p><p>But one must understand that</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had only just taken control of the Taishan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>If Taishi Yi were to remain as the Prefect of Taishan, it would place him above Gu Yang, the Guangyang King.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>the position of Prefect was not even worth considering.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>among the twelve prefectures of Taishan, Qingjiang Prefecture was the most prosperous. In Taishi Yi's eyes, being appointed the Prefect of Qingjiang Prefecture was a sign of Gu Yang's esteem.</p><p></p><p>Before coming to pledge his allegiance, Taishi Yi had prepared for the worst, which was being stripped of all his rights and being relegated to some insignificant place to live out the rest of his days.</p><p></p><p>Even worse, he was unsure if he would even make it back alive.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the position of Prefect of Qingjiang Prefecture, Taishi Yi was overjoyed, and any lingering doubts had dissipated like smoke.</p><p></p><p>"I have always believed in rewarding those with merit. Taishan Prefecture is too small, and the entire Qingyu State is not that large either. Your ambitions should not be limited to just a small corner of Taishan Prefecture," Gu Yang said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Taishi Yi respectfully cupped his fists: "I thank Your Majesty for the guidance. I will devote my utmost efforts to managing Qingjiang Prefecture and will certainly not disappoint Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"Very well then."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang nodded, and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter,</p><p></p><p>Taishi Yi took his leave.</p><p></p><p>Watching the retreating figure, Gu Yang's smile gradually faded.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi emerged from the shadows and handed Gu Yang a report he had gathered.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, please take a look."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang took the report, carefully reading it for a moment, and then with a flick of his palm, the paper turned to dust and scattered on the floor.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi spoke in a low voice, "Taishi Yi is not truly loyal. Shall I take care of him?"</p><p></p><p>"No need. Now that he has obtained the position of Prefect of Qingjiang Prefecture, as long as he is not foolish, he will not cause any trouble at this time. Just keep an eye on him in secret.</p><p></p><p>If he behaves himself,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, then everything will remain the same. If there are any sinister intentions, we can deal with it at that time!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The content recorded in the intelligence was about Taishu Yi gathering a large army.</p><p></p><p>The other party thought this matter was kept secret, but it was all seen by the undercover guards. Taishu Yi would have such actions, and Gu Yang could understand it with just a little thought - the other party was coming to the Liuyun Manor to make preparations for this expedition.</p><p></p><p>If he really detained the other party or slaughtered them, this large army would become the main force to rescue them.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>From the very beginning.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had no intention of taking action against Taishu Yi.</p><p></p><p>The reason was very simple.</p><p></p><p>Taishu Yi was a true defector, whether it was sincere or not, Gu Yang also had to put on a good show outwardly.</p><p></p><p>If he took action against Taishu Yi at this time, it would only ruin his own reputation.</p><p></p><p>You must know.</p><p></p><p>There are many eyes watching this Guangyang King now.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was not stingy at all, and directly granted Taishu Yi the position of the Prefect of Qingjiang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, this was also to tell others.</p><p></p><p>If they defect, Gu Yang will certainly not treat them badly.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang came to the central hall of the sand table.</p><p></p><p>On it.</p><p></p><p>The twelve prefectures of Taishan Prefecture have all been marked with his own flag.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Gu Yang led the army to conquer various places, and nine of the twelve prefectures of Taishan Prefecture have fallen under his control.</p><p></p><p>Now.</p><p></p><p>Taishu Yi has defected in the name of the Prefect, and the remaining three prefectures have also fallen under his control.</p><p></p><p>In this way.</p><p></p><p>The twelve prefectures of Taishan Prefecture have all become Gu Yang's.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the sand table in front of him, Gu Yang's expression was somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>At one time.</p><p></p><p>He spent a lot of time and resources, and could only barely cultivate a hundred thousand-strong army, lurking in the Baishi Road waiting for an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>But with the arrival of the Shenwu Army at the Baishi Road, everything underwent an earth-shattering reversal.</p><p></p><p>First, Gu Yang led a hundred thousand-strong army to defeat the Shenwu Army led by Pei Jing, and then he suppressed the entire Guangyang Prefecture with a thunderous force and proclaimed himself king.</p><p></p><p>Then.</p><p></p><p>It only took a few months to completely subdue the twelve prefectures of Taishan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Looking back now.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang found that he had unknowingly grasped the territory of a prefecture, with an army of over a hundred thousand, and there were not a few powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>The grand master martial artists who were once high above, Gu Yang now had more than a dozen of them under his command.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this change.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was very clear.</p><p></p><p>It was not because of his own strength, nor because of his many plans, but because he was backed by a powerful figure who was revered as the supreme master of the martial arts world today.</p><p></p><p>"In this world, the strong are supreme!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>A supremely powerful figure can change the pattern of the world.</p><p></p><p>Looking back now, Gu Yang found that he had been a bit negligent in his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Possessing the territory of a prefecture, with abundant cultivation resources, and his own innate talent was not bad, but so far, he had only just broken through the middle stage of Refining Bone.</p><p></p><p>If it was in the past, the middle stage of Refining Bone would not be weak.</p><p></p><p>But if he looks at the Nine Provinces, this level of cultivation power is a bit insufficient.</p><p></p><p>Immediately.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang made a decision.</p><p></p><p>Now that the entire Taishan Prefecture is under his control, the next step is to rest and recuperate for a period of time, and also to improve his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Not to say that he will raise it to a high level, but at least it should be decent.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

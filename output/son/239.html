        <h1>Chapter 239</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Inside the imperial palace, a servant respectfully presented a golden box to Gu Yang. </p><p></p><p>Gu Yang opened the box and saw several fragments inside, with three larger pieces and five smaller ones.</p><p></p><p>Even as fragments, Gu Yang could sense the terrifying aura of the sacred artifacts within.</p><p></p><p>"You have done well. I hereby grant you one of these sacred artifact fragments."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang then directly awarded one of the larger fragments to Gu Yi, who was deeply grateful.</p><p></p><p>These were fragments of sacred artifacts. Though broken, they still contained immense divine power. For ordinary cultivators, these fragments could still be of great use.</p><p></p><p>This was why Gu Yang had been secretly collecting these sacred artifact fragments. After the Blazing Sun Mirror was destroyed in Xing'an County, Gu Yang had people search for the scattered fragments, but many others were also eyeing this priceless treasure.</p><p></p><p>So far, Gu Yang had managed to gather less than ten fragments. However, due to the varying sizes, he now possessed about a third of the complete Blazing Sun Mirror. If there was a master craftsman, they may be able to reforge all the fragments and fully restore the mirror.</p><p></p><p>But finding such a skilled forger was no easy task, and the cost of restoration would be high. Plus, Gu Yang already had the Divine Phoenix Pagoda, so he had no plans to reforge the Blazing Sun Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, I need my secret guards to infiltrate the Nine Provinces Academy and investigate some talented cultivators, their backgrounds, and their loyalty to the court. Compile a list of those without issues and who are loyal, and present it to me."</p><p></p><p>"Understood," Gu Yi acknowledged.</p><p></p><p>"Also—" Gu Yang paused, looking serious as he gazed outside the study. "Find a way to send a group of people into the Desolate Ancient Domains. I want to fully understand and control the information about the Desolate Ancient Domains, and I will send one of the imperial attendants to accompany them."</p><p></p><p>The imperial attendants referred to were people like Gu Wu, who were originally elders of the Gu Clan but now served the court, with the additional title of imperial attendant.</p><p></p><p>The Gu Clan and the Divine Martial Kingdom were closely related, but they were still separate entities. </p><p></p><p>With many powerful cultivators from the Eastern Domain entering the Nine Provinces, and many fierce beasts in the Ancient Beast Mountain Range being slain, the danger level of the mountain range had decreased significantly. And with a Transcendent Realm cultivator leading the way, crossing the Ancient Beast Mountain Range would not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>The reason Gu Yang wanted to do this was that the Nine Provinces had already been exposed to the other forces of the Desolate Ancient Domains. Even if the Divine Martial Kingdom remained inactive, they would likely still face repercussions from the other powers.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Yang wanted to be proactive and gather intelligence.</p><p></p><p>"I will carry out your orders," Gu Yi said.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang continued, "Finally, take all the storage rings and bags collected from the fallen Eastern Domain cultivators, and have my father at the Gu Clan break the seals and restrictions on them. Bring the ones without restrictions to me."</p><p></p><p>In less than a day, Gu Yi brought over a batch of over a thousand storage rings and bags. </p><p></p><p>After a long while, a smile spread across Gu Yang's face.</p><p></p><p>"Excellent, excellent! With such a trove, the Divine Martial Kingdom will truly flourish!"</p><p></p><p>He was genuinely excited. Among the items were over 500 different cultivation techniques, not counting the duplicates, spanning from Transcendent Realm to Dao Palace Realm. </p><p></p><p>This was exactly what the Divine Martial Kingdom had been lacking - a shortage of top-tier cultivation techniques. Gu Yang himself only had the Departing Wind True Classic and the Divine Yang Classic created by his father.</p><p></p><p>But for an entire kingdom, that was far from enough. Now, with this influx of techniques, the cultivation foundation of the Divine Martial Kingdom would be greatly strengthened.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this was not the full extent of the gains. Once the items brought to the Gu Clan were all freed from their restrictions, the kingdom's repertoire of techniques would expand even further.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the cultivation techniques, there were also numerous divine weapons, treasures, and elixirs - items that could provide an immediate boost to the kingdom's overall strength, unlike techniques that required time to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Though the highest-grade items were only Transcendent Realm artifacts, for the currently impoverished Divine Martial Kingdom, even these were a godsend.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the secret guards had also delivered a large number of storage rings and bags to the Gu Clan. Gu Qingfeng looked at the piled up items, his expression filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The object was as large as a small mountain, numbering in the thousands at a glance.</p><p></p><p>"This kid really doesn't see himself as an outsider!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head and chuckled, then did not refuse, directly using his divine sense to break through the restrictions on top, and then had the hidden guards bring everything back to the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>For him, the restrictions left behind by the saints could not stop him, let alone the restrictions of the Divine Change Realm and the Dao Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took out the jade bottle containing fresh blood and the severed finger sealed with gold.</p><p></p><p>Seeing these two items again, Gu Qingfeng's expression became increasingly solemn. The terrifying aura emanating from them was enough to show their extraordinary nature.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Gu Qingfeng's vision was limited, and he only felt that the two items were somewhat unfathomable, but he could not determine what kind of concept they represented.</p><p></p><p>Even now,</p><p></p><p>With his cultivation reaching the saint-like level, Gu Qingfeng still dared not be certain of the level of the original owner of these two items.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the drop of blood before him or the severed finger, the aura they emanated was much more terrifying than that of the Great Saint of the Heavenly Phoenix.</p><p></p><p>In other words,</p><p></p><p>The mysterious existence that left behind these two items was at least a powerhouse that surpassed the Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>As for how much stronger they were compared to the Great Saints, Gu Qingfeng did not know for the time being.</p><p></p><p>After a long while,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng carefully put away these two items.</p><p></p><p>Since he could not research them, he would wait until his cultivation was more advanced to do so.</p><p></p><p>He believed that as long as his strength continued to increase, all the mysteries would eventually be revealed before him.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was not in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>He looked at the information panel, and there were new words refreshed on it.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' was attacked by cultivators *1369!"</p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' was attacked by cultivators *3666!"</p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' was seriously injured but managed to escape!"</p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' obtained a large amount of cultivation method inheritance, wielding power across the world, greatly increasing the foundation of his forces!"</p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' consumed heavenly materials and earthly treasures, with his cultivation slightly advancing!"</p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' consumed mysterious elixirs, with his cultivation slightly advancing!"</p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' cultivated mysterious inheritance, with his strength slightly advancing!"</p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' entered the Taixu Sacred Land and became a true disciple!"</p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' received guidance from the strong cultivators of the Taixu Sacred Land, with his cultivation advancing!"</p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' was critically injured and on the verge of death, but broke through and obtained guidance from the remnant soul of a Great Saint, advancing his cultivation to the first layer of the Lianxie Realm!"</p><p>"Reward points increased by *80!"</p><p>"Your offspring..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The first layer of the Lianxie Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's brows furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiu's breakthrough did not bring him much joy.</p><p></p><p>Judging from the number of times Gu Xiu was attacked, his current situation seemed to be becoming increasingly difficult.</p><p></p><p>In such a short time,</p><p></p><p>He had been attacked no less than thousands of times, and was even seriously injured, indicating that he was facing significant problems.</p><p></p><p>Now,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had enough strength to enter the Huangu Realm, with the Cloud Thunder Cauldron in his possession and his own cultivation reaching the saint-like level. He could not only dominate the five domains but also suppress a region.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, Gu Qingfeng naturally had the idea of leaving the Huangu Realm and bringing Gu Xiu back.</p><p></p><p>But the problem was,</p><p></p><p>The Huangu Realm was too vast.</p><p></p><p>Even a corner of the Eastern Domain was several times larger than the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>To find a single person, it was no easy task.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng summoned Red Leaf.</p><p></p><p>"What are your orders, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>The latter responded with reverence.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng waved his sleeve, and a divine sword suddenly flew out from the Grinding Hall, landing in front of Red Leaf. He then flicked his finger, and a drop of fresh blood merged into the divine sword.</p><p></p><p>In an instant,</p><p></p><p>The divine sword erupted with a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng used his divine sense to set up a restriction, forcibly suppressing this aura.</p><p></p><p>"This sword contains a drop of my blood and has three uses. Its power can rival ancient weapons, and it can slay cultivators at the Dao Palace Realm and below."</p><p></p><p>"You will take this sword and lead a group of hidden guards to the Eastern Domain, and try to establish a foothold there, then gather information about the Third Young Master."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng ordered.</p><p></p><p>Red Leaf's expression remained unchanged as he respectfully received the divine sword and bowed.</p><p></p><p>"I will definitely do my utmost and not disappoint Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng waved his hand, and Red Leaf bowed again before turning and leaving.</p><p></p><p>After Red Leaf's departure,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also looked towards the direction of the Ancient Beast Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>This natural barrier was no longer as important as before.</p><p></p><p>After all, many cultivators had entered the Nine Provinces, and with the existence of the communication jade slips, the presence of the Nine Provinces had already been exposed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng believed,</p><p></p><p>The cultivators from the Huangu Realm who would come to the Nine Provinces in the future would be endless.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was out of curiosity about the Divine Wu Dynasty or the desire for the opportunities in the Nine Provinces, they were destined to attract many cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that,</p><p></p><p>Ever since the emergence of the Great Saint's Secret Realm, it was already destined that the Divine Wu Dynasty would truly be connected to the Huangu Realm.</p><p></p><p>The difference was,</p><p></p><p>If the Divine Wu Dynasty was just an ordinary dynasty, once it was exposed to the vision of the various cultivators in the Huangu Realm, it would inevitably bring about a catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>After all, in this world where the strong prevail, the so-called rules can be trampled upon at will.</p><p></p><p>Even the laws of the dynasty must be based on sufficient strength.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Wu Dynasty had its own laws, but the problem was, if there was not enough strength to support it, who would obey the laws of the Divine Wu Dynasty? Therefore,</p><p></p><p>If the Divine Wu Dynasty was just an ordinary dynasty, when other cultivators entered the Nine Provinces, to overthrow it would be as easy as child's play.</p><p></p><p>However—</p><p></p><p>These were just hypothetical scenarios.</p><p></p><p>In fact,</p><p></p><p>Since the battle in Jing'an County, Gu Qingfeng had demonstrated his powerful strength, which was a signal to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Although the Divine Wu Dynasty was a dynasty, it was not a soft target to be bullied. If anyone dared to enter the Nine Provinces and act recklessly, they would have to see if they had the strength to do so.</p><p></p><p>This was another reason why Gu Qingfeng had massacred the other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It was both to eliminate the root cause and to tell the cultivators in the Huangu Realm that the Divine Wu Dynasty not only had top-tier powerhouses at its core, but also ruthless methods.</p><p></p><p>If they dared to cause trouble,</p><p></p><p>This would be the fate that awaited them.</p><p></p><p>In this way,</p><p></p><p>Even if there were cultivators who entered the Nine Provinces in the future, Gu Qingfeng believed that it would not cause too much turmoil.</p><p></p><p>And this,</p><p></p><p>Was also an inevitable process for the Divine Wu Dynasty to integrate into the Huangu Realm.</p>

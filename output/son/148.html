        <h1>Chapter 148</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"A Grand Martial Arts Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, after many years, another Grand Martial Arts Master has emerged in the jianghu (martial arts world)..."</p><p></p><p>Within the Shenwu Sect, a burly and robust man heard this news. His tiger-like eyes gleamed with might, and a powerful aura emanated from him.</p><p></p><p>This man was Gu Yun, the current Sect Master of the Shenwu Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Masters have not appeared for many years. It is doubtful whether this news is true," one of the Shenwu Sect's Elders said, shaking his head slightly with a skeptical attitude.</p><p></p><p>The other Elders also nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>They all understood how difficult it was to reach the level of a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, according to the intelligence they had obtained, the person in question, Gu Qingfeng, had not been renowned in the past. It was only after he had eliminated the Shenjuan Sect and was suspected to have reached the level of a True Meaning Master that his name began to spread.</p><p></p><p>And now, it had been only a short while since then.</p><p></p><p>The martial artist who was previously suspected to be a True Meaning Master had now become a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>Such news would make anyone doubtful.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun shook his head and said, "Regardless of whether the news is true or false, we cannot ignore it. In this world, sorcerers are revered, and the martial arts have declined. A Grand Master represents something significant, and I'm sure you all understand that."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, this news has already spread. Those immortal sects and powerful families will likely not sit idly by.</p><p></p><p>If we can bring him back to our Shenwu Sect and control the legacy left by the Patriarch, perhaps we can lead our Shenwu Sect to a resurgence."</p><p></p><p>Reviving the Shenwu Sect was Gu Yun's lifelong goal.</p><p></p><p>Alas, the Shenwu Sect had been in decline for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Although each generation had produced Master-level experts, they had only reached the level of Masters, not Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>The Shenwu Sect had not seen a Grand Master emerge for a long time.</p><p></p><p>There had been occasional rumors of Grand Masters appearing in the jianghu, but by the time the Shenwu Sect arrived, those Grand Masters had already vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun was well aware that these disappearances of Grand Masters were all due to the interference of the immortal sects and powerful families.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when the news came from Qingyun State, it made Gu Yun somewhat impatient.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Elders before him, Gu Yun said in a deep voice, "I have decided to go to Qingyun State myself. The affairs of the Sect will be temporarily handled by Elder Yue Feng."</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master's identity is noble. How can he recklessly venture into danger?" </p><p></p><p>"That's right, our Shenwu Sect is a thorn in the eyes of many factions. If the Sect Master leaves the Sect, there will likely be no small amount of trouble!"</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, please reconsider!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Gu Yun's words fell, the other Sect Elders immediately changed their expressions, hastily trying to persuade him to stay.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Yun stood firm in his decision and was determined to set out for Qingyun State immediately.</p><p></p><p>After all, the news from Qingyun State had already spread, and other factions were likely to take action as well.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun had to reach Qingyun State before the other sects.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has defeated the imperial army, and his forces have greatly increased!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has broken through to the initial stage of the Refine Bone Realm in battle!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +100 Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 100 Refine Bone Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 100 Marrow-Washing Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 10 Refine Viscera Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain 566 imperial soldiers!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain 3 Refine Bone Realm martial artists!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Yang'er has broken through!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression momentarily faltered, but then his face relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Yang's breakthrough this time was much faster than before, it was still understandable.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Qingfeng had provided Gu Yang with all the elixirs he could use, and now, having experienced life-and-death battles on the battlefield, Gu Yang's cultivation had advanced rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With that, it would be even easier to comprehend the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, now that the Gu Family Army has conquered various regions, Gu Yang likely possesses many resources.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Yang's breakthrough is only natural.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the improvement brought about by Alang's breakthrough is much greater than that of others. If someone else were to break through the Refine Bone Realm, the improvement would likely not even be half as much," Gu Qingfeng mused.</p><p></p><p>As Gu Yang was his first offspring, every advancement he made brought about extremely bountiful rewards. This was something unmatched by others.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Qingfeng valued Gu Yang the most.</p><p></p><p>Now, with a hundred advancement points in hand, Gu Qingfeng glanced at his attribute panel, and numerous martial arts were displayed before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"At the moment, the only martial arts I can use these advancement points to improve are the Sun and Moon Fist Sutra and the Heavenly Vein True Sutra!"</p><p></p><p>There was no other choice. The other martial arts had already been cultivated to perfection or had been broken through once or twice.</p><p></p><p>If a martial art was broken through, or if a broken-through martial art continued to be improved, the required advancement points would be astronomical, and such an approach would not be cost-effective.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, Gu Qingfeng had already achieved perfect body refinement.</p><p></p><p>No matter how much he cultivated martial arts below the Patriarch realm, it would not bring about any changes to his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Only breakthroughs in Patriarch-level or higher martial arts could bring about some changes to him.</p><p></p><p>However, the problem was that to break through a Refining Essence martial art to the Patriarch realm would require five hundred advancement points, and to break through a Patriarch martial art to the Grand Patriarch realm would require a thousand advancement points.</p><p></p><p>Either of these two options was beyond Gu Qingfeng's current capacity.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, martial art breakthroughs were something Gu Qingfeng could only set aside for now.</p><p></p><p>As for the Sun and Moon Fist Sutra, to be honest, even if he were to improve this Patriarch-level martial art, the increase in his strength would be limited.</p><p></p><p>A Patriarch-level fist art may seem impressive, but it is ultimately just that.</p><p></p><p>The Tyrannical Saber, also a Patriarch-level martial art, had already been improved by Gu Qingfeng to the perfection stage, and a maxed-out Tyrannical Saber was much stronger than the so-called Sun and Moon Fist Sutra.</p><p></p><p>Unless the Sun and Moon Fist Sutra could also be perfected, Gu Qingfeng's attention would turn to the final option, the Heavenly Vein True Sutra.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Great Heavenly Veins, with their boundless combat power!</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had also tried to cultivate the Heavenly Vein True Sutra, but he found that not only was consolidating the Nine Great Heavenly Veins extremely difficult, even just consolidating the first Heavenly Vein was an arduous task.</p><p></p><p>At least up to this point, Gu Qingfeng had not even grasped the threshold of the Heavenly Vein True Sutra.</p><p></p><p>"Then let me see if this so-called Heavenly Vein True Sutra is truly as powerful as described!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes flickered, and he immediately proceeded to improve the Heavenly Vein True Sutra.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a hundred advancement points vanished, and the Heavenly Vein True Sutra, without even entering the door, directly broke through to the first realm.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a flood of memories surged forth.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng felt as if he had cultivated the Heavenly Vein True Sutra for hundreds or thousands of years. His flesh and blood were surging like a raging river, boiling like a blazing furnace. Terrifying blood energy was gathering in a certain area of his body.</p><p></p><p>His flesh trembled, and his tendons and bones resonated.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Qingfeng's flesh and blood underwent a earth-shattering transformation, with powerful blood tides crashing against his body one after another.</p><p></p><p>Finally, a blood-colored vein condensed.</p><p></p><p>Savage! Ancient! This vein was unlike the ordinary meridians of a person, yet it was filled with a profound and unfathomable aura.</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

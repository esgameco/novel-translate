            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After a while, </p><p></p><p>he smiled faintly and said, "Thank you, Fellow Daoist Fu, for informing me. I am deeply grateful!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately after,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng changed the topic.</p><p></p><p>"Now that there are celestial anomalies outside the Tiexiong Pass, I believe a secret realm will soon open. Since Fellow Daoist Fu has come, why don't you stay at the government office and wait for the opportunity?"</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I thank you, Fellow Daoist Gu!"</p><p></p><p>Fu He did not decline, as his purpose in coming was to see if this newly emerged secret realm would provide him a chance to break through to the Dao Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had someone arrange for Fu He's accommodation.</p><p></p><p>In the following few days,</p><p></p><p>the celestial anomalies grew increasingly intense. </p><p></p><p>Not only could they be seen in the Nine Provinces and the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, but even in the Eastern Domain, many cultivators sensed these disturbances.</p><p></p><p>At this time,</p><p></p><p>the Guangyang Prefecture was filled with powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>The majority of them had entered the Tiexiong Pass, waiting for the opportune moment.</p><p></p><p>Three days later,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang also led a large army to arrive.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>this time Gu Yang did not bring too many troops, only the Tiangang Army.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Tiangang Army was the most elite force of the Shenwu Empire.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Gu Yang had Shizhen reorganize the Tiangang Army, making even the weakest cultivators reach the Washing Marrow Realm, while the strongest had even stepped into the Patriarch Realm.</p><p></p><p>With Shizhen, a top-tier Grand Patriarch, leading them, once the Tiangang Divine Slaughter Formation was established, even Manifestation Realm cultivators would not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>when Gu Yang led the Tiangang Army, it immediately drew the attention of many.</p><p></p><p>"This army is not bad at all. Although their cultivation is a bit lacking, the aura of their killing intent can only be forged on the battlefield!"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the Shenwu Empire was just established a year ago, and before that, the Dao of cultivation in the Nine Provinces had declined, with even Grand Patriarchs being quite rare.</p><p></p><p>For the Shengu Emperor to have amassed such power in such a short time is indeed remarkable."</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators nodded approvingly towards the Tiangang Army, appreciating this elite force, although this appreciation was limited.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the Eastern Domain, this army would not be considered truly elite, it was only in the Nine Provinces that they would attract some attention.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the Nine Provinces are not as simple as they appear on the surface. Don't forget how the Elder Blood Cloud died!"</p><p></p><p>A cultivator sneered, and hearing this, the others were stunned, their expressions turning grave.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they realized that the Nine Provinces were not weak.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Dao of martial arts seemed feeble on the surface, there were top-tier Dao Palace realm experts secretly guarding it.</p><p></p><p>Even the newcomers had learned from other cultivators that the Nine Provinces had a peak Dao Palace realm expert who had killed the Elder Blood Cloud with just two moves.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently,</p><p></p><p>another cultivator sneered, "I heard that the Guiyuan Empire has a prince who perished here, and Ji Meng is leading a hundred thousand Divine Emperor Army to directly break through the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, and he is even carrying a semi-Saint artifact."</p><p></p><p>The Guiyuan Empire! </p><p>A semi-Saint artifact! </p><p>Hearing this, the other cultivators couldn't help but take a sharp breath.</p><p></p><p>In this era when Saints were scarce, the Guiyuan Empire was undoubtedly one of the top powers, and Ji Meng's reputation as a Dao Palace realm cultivator at the seventh level was well-known.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that eight hundred years ago, the Guiyuan Empire once clashed with an ancient holy land, and Ji Meng led a hundred thousand Divine Emperor Army to forcibly kill a peak Dao Palace realm expert at the ninth level.</p><p></p><p>After that battle, the Divine Emperor Army became renowned."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the revenge may be a pretense, and the real purpose is to seize the Saint inheritance in the hands of the ancient holy land."</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the Guiyuan Empire's true intentions, upon hearing that Ji Meng was leading a hundred thousand Divine Emperor Army and even carrying a semi-Saint artifact to break through the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, many cultivators were inwardly shaken.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>there were also some who secretly looked forward to it.</p><p></p><p>When two tigers fight, one is bound to be injured.</p><p></p><p>Although the Shenwu Empire was a newly established dynasty, it also had peak Dao Palace realm experts guarding it, but the Guiyuan Empire's foundations were not simple either.</p><p></p><p>If the two sides clashed, they might have a chance to benefit as bystanders.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had already led the army to enter Xing'an County.</p><p></p><p>He was also well-informed about the matter of the Elder Blood Cloud.</p><p></p><p>When he learned that Gu Qingfeng had slain the Elder Blood Cloud, Gu Yang was indeed shocked, but he quickly recovered.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang already had a certain understanding of Gu Qingfeng's strength, so while killing a Dao Palace realm expert at the third level was shocking, he soon accepted it.</p><p></p><p>In the government office,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at Gu Yi and said, "Have the secret guards closely monitor the situation in Guangyang Prefecture, but make sure not to expose themselves."</p><p></p><p>The secret guards were a sharp blade in his hands, but their overall strength was not too strong. If they encountered powerful experts from the outside, it would be difficult for them to escape unharmed.</p><p></p><p>"I will follow your orders!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Yi saluted and left.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang also had someone bring Gu Xuan over, and the two of them had a long discussion.</p><p></p><p>From Gu Xuan's account, Gu Yang was able to understand what had happened during this period, as when Gu Xuan had disappeared from the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, Gu Yang had secretly sent people to search for him, but unfortunately, the secret guards who entered the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, very few were able to make it out alive.</p><p></p><p>Even those who managed to survive did not bring back any useful information.</p><p></p><p>As a result,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had no choice but to give up the search.</p><p></p><p>"You were able to enter the Taixu Holy Land, that's not bad. By the way, your third brother has also gone out into the world."</p><p></p><p>In the end, Gu Yang said one more sentence.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Xuan's expression changed slightly: "Third brother has also gone out into the world?"</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that while he had returned, Gu Xiu had left.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang nodded: "Father once said that Third Brother has great opportunities, leaving the Nine Provinces is not necessarily a bad thing. Perhaps the next time we see Third Brother, he will have become a powerful expert!"</p><p></p><p>To be honest,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was not worried about Gu Xiu.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Qingfeng had already agreed, so there must not be any problems.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan's expression shifted slightly, but he did not ask any further questions.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since you've finally returned, stay for a few more days."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye,</p><p></p><p>another three days had passed.</p><p></p><p>In these three days,</p><p></p><p>the celestial anomalies had become increasingly intense, and more and more powerful experts had arrived.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>a murderous aura surged into the sky, startling many cultivators. They all turned towards the direction it came from, only to see a middle-aged cultivator in battle armor, with a sturdy and resolute appearance, leading an army of ten thousand golden-armored soldiers.</p><p></p><p>If one looked closely, they would notice that the ten thousand golden-armored soldiers...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The armor of the hundred-thousand-strong army was stained with blood that had not yet dried, clearly having just experienced a fierce battle.</p><p></p><p>Now.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the hundred-thousand-strong imperial army was met with a deathly silence, the invisible aura of slaughter causing the cultivators who sensed the army's arrival to inwardly shudder in alarm.</p><p></p><p>"The people of the Guiyuan Empire have arrived!"</p><p></p><p>"Ji Meng has actually led the hundred-thousand divine imperial army to break through the Ancient Beast Mountain Range!"</p><p></p><p>Any cultivators familiar with the perilous nature of the Ancient Beast Mountain Range now took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>As one of the most ancient mountain ranges in the Wasteland Realm, the Ancient Beast Mountain Range was home to numerous powerful beasts, some of which had even reached the Divine Transformation Realm or the Dao Palace Realm. </p><p></p><p>There were even rumors that in the deepest parts of the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, a beast as powerful as a Saint resided in slumber.</p><p></p><p>Although this rumor had not been confirmed, it was enough to demonstrate the terrifying nature of the Ancient Beast Mountain Range. Even Dao Palace Realm cultivators had to be extremely cautious when traversing it, as they could easily be overturned by a powerful beast.</p><p></p><p>For a target as large as the hundred-thousand divine imperial army to directly enter the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, they must have provoked many beasts, and the fresh blood on the soldiers' armor was evidence of the battles they had endured.</p><p></p><p>Yet, despite this, the hundred-thousand-strong army had still arrived here, testament to the fearsome might of the Divine Imperial Army.</p><p></p><p>On the city walls of Xing'an County, Gu Yang also looked towards the Divine Imperial Army, his gaze heavy with solemnity and a hint of ardor.</p><p></p><p>"The Guiyuan Empire is truly the top power in the Eastern Domain, the hundred-thousand divine imperial army is indeed the elite of the elite!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang sighed inwardly. He could see that even the weakest cultivators in the arriving army were at the Grand Ancestor Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Grand Ancestors were considered top-tier experts in the Nine Provinces. Even now, the true cultivators who could reach the Grand Ancestor Realm were few and far between.</p><p></p><p>Yet, in the Divine Imperial Army, the Grand Ancestors were merely the most common foot soldiers. Even if all the Divine Imperial Army were Grand Ancestors, that would still be a hundred thousand Grand Ancestors. But the problem was that as the elite of the Guiyuan Empire, the Divine Imperial Army could not possibly be limited to just Grand Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ji Meng stepped into the air, his terrifying aura erupting and causing the heavens and earth to tremble.</p><p></p><p>"My sixth prince has fallen here, and the Divine Wu Dynasty must give an account!"</p><p></p><p>Before arriving in the Nine Provinces, Ji Meng had already received news that Han An and the others had entered the capital and been suppressed by the experts of the Divine Wu Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, Han An's demise was related to the Divine Wu Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Ji Meng now had the air of one seeking retribution.</p><p></p><p>As his words fell, the terrifying Dao Palace Realm pressure began to sweep towards Xing'an County.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators of the Divine Wu Dynasty changed expression, deeply feeling their own insignificance under such a powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a sword's hum rang out, and a sword made of spiritual energy abruptly descended, dispersing the encroaching aura. The spiritual energy sword then continued its attack towards Ji Meng.</p><p></p><p>Ji Meng's expression changed slightly, and he struck out with a punch to collide with the spiritual energy sword. The sword shattered, and Ji Meng retreated a step, his fist bearing cracks that quickly healed, unnoticed by the others.</p><p></p><p>"Peak of the Dao Palace Realm!" Ji Meng's expression was grave. In that exchange, he had been defeated.</p><p></p><p>Anyone capable of defeating him with a long-range strike must be a top expert at the ninth layer of the Dao Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, Ji Meng was not afraid. After all, he had not come alone, but with the backing of the hundred-thousand divine imperial army. If he fought with his full strength, even a top Dao Palace Realm expert could be slain.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Gu Yang stood with his hands behind his back, his gaze towards Ji Meng cold: "The people of the Guiyuan Empire dare to assault the imperial capital, courting their own destruction. I have not yet demanded an account from the Guiyuan Empire, and yet you have come seeking retribution first!"</p><p></p><p>"A mere Grand Ancestor is not worthy to spout such nonsense before me."</p><p></p><p>Ji Meng's expression turned cold, and he was about to strike down Gu Yang on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was not afraid, for he had the backing of Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Just as the two were about to clash, the void trembled, and a divine light shot into the sky, forming a towering figure that stood tall, the ancient aura permeating the heavens, causing all the cultivators to instinctively turn their gaze towards it.</p><p></p><p>"This aura!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng, who was in the government office, paused in his tea-drinking, his gaze piercing towards the figure, recognizing it as a Saint.</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps a Great Saint!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression shifted slightly. This terrifying ancient aura made his spirit and blood tremble, as if he was bearing an immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>Even at his current cultivation, facing a peak Dao Palace Realm expert would not evoke such a reaction in him.</p><p></p><p>Now, just a faint projection had such an imposing presence, hinting at the terrifying power the figure possessed in its prime.</p><p></p><p>The towering figure in the void slowly spoke, its majestic voice reaching the ears of every cultivator:</p><p></p><p>"I am the Great Saint of the Heavenly Phoenix, and I have left a secret realm here for transmission. All below the Dao Palace Realm may enter!"</p><p></p><p>With those words, the projection of the Great Saint of the Heavenly Phoenix vanished, and a bronze gate appeared outside the Tianxiong Pass.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, all the powerful cultivators were shaken, their faces filled with greed and astonishment as they looked at the bronze gate.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Saint of the Heavenly Phoenix, could it be the one from fifty thousand years ago?!"</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that this figure was once at the peak of the Great Saint Realm, an existence that dominated the Wasteland Realm fifty thousand years ago. Yet, he has left a transmission here in the Nine Provinces!"</p><p></p><p>"It is said that in the ancient past, the Nine Provinces were at their pinnacle, with an unparalleled power that suppressed the Wasteland Realm. Later, that power suddenly vanished, and many powerful cultivators have entered this place, seeking the legacy left behind."</p><p></p><p>The transmission of a Great Saint Realm expert was enough to captivate all the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>If the Saint Realm transmission obtained by the Holy Sun Sect was only of interest to a portion of powers, the transmission of the Great Saint of the Heavenly Phoenix was completely different.</p><p></p><p>A Saint Realm transmission was one thing, but a Great Saint transmission was another entirely. Moreover, the Great Saint of the Heavenly Phoenix was a top expert among the Great Saints, having reached the ninth layer of the Great Saint Realm, with a cultivation that had reached the pinnacle of creation. Obtaining such a legacy would undoubtedly catapult one to new heights.</p><p></p><p>Even many powers that had previously broken through the Great Saint Realm or even higher would be unable to remain calm if they learned of the Great Saint of the Heavenly Phoenix's transmission. After all, the benefits of obtaining a Great Saint's legacy were immeasurable.</p>

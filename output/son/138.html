        <h1>Chapter 138</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's thoughts stirred, and he directly promoted the Hegemon Saber Slash to the perfected level.</p><p></p><p>In the instant the promotion point disappeared,</p><p></p><p>a surge of memory emerged from the depths of Gu Qingfeng's mind, and at the same time, a terrifying aura of the saber intent erupted in the hall, causing the Red Leaf and the others standing outside the hall to instinctively shudder, as if they had been locked onto by a terrifying existence.</p><p></p><p>That feeling.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the slightest movement could lead to instant death.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately,</p><p></p><p>this aura came quickly and disappeared just as fast.</p><p></p><p>In less than a moment,</p><p></p><p>the aura completely subsided.</p><p></p><p>"Whew!"</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness's strength is truly unfathomable!"</p><p></p><p>The few exchanged glances, all seeing a trace of shock in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>They were all peak Innate Sect Masters, but under the lock of that aura, they too seemed to have the possibility of meeting their demise at any moment.</p><p></p><p>â€”</p><p></p><p>Inside the hall,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng opened his eyes, and an extremely sharp saber intent burst forth from his gaze, leaving two white traces in the air that lingered for a long time without dissipating.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was like a saber!</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had truly achieved this state in the literal sense.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>he looked at his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>... </p><p></p><p>Hegemon Saber Slash (Perfected, Hegemon Saber True Intent Lv.9)! ...</p><p></p><p>"Ninth-level True Intent!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the limit that a True Intent Master can reach!"</p><p></p><p>"Going further, the True Intent realm would need to break through the shackles of the ninth level and ascend to an even higher plane."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered.</p><p></p><p>However, based on the current situation, the True Intent Masters in the world were most likely only at the initial stage of comprehending the Sect Master's True Intent, just at the level of sixth-level True Intent.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Sect Masters who had fallen at Gu Qingfeng's hands were also of that caliber, but those who had truly comprehended the True Intent were few and far between.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the eighth-level Sect Master's True Intent</p><p></p><p>had already allowed Gu Qingfeng to dominate the Sect Master realm.</p><p></p><p>This was not only due to his own foundation, but also because of the terrifying Hegemon Saber Slash.</p><p></p><p>Now,</p><p></p><p>having reached the ninth-level True Intent,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng found that the ninth-level True Intent was at least twice as powerful as the eighth-level True Intent.</p><p></p><p>With such True Intent power, he could easily annihilate any cultivator below the Sect Master realm, and even Sect Masters would likely be slain directly.</p><p></p><p>Combined with his current strength, Gu Qingfeng could hardly imagine who among the so-called Alchemist Realm cultivators could be his match.</p><p></p><p>"Whew!"</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, I wonder if I can contend with that demonic Buddha in the Nine Curved Path!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked towards the direction of the Nine Curved Path, and after reaching the Extreme Dao Sect Master realm and the ninth-level True Intent, his perception had become much more acute.</p><p></p><p>In his perception, the direction of the Nine Curved Path had a strange and evil aura, shining like a beacon in the dark night.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng felt an impulse, he wanted to enter the Nine Curved Path and fight that demonic Buddha.</p><p></p><p>But soon,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng suppressed this urge.</p><p></p><p>Because the demonic Buddha in the Nine Curved Path was no ordinary being, and in his current view, it was even more powerful than the so-called Alchemist Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>If Fei Jingzhen had sacrificed himself to summon the demonic Buddha and let it out of the Nine Curved Path, the outcome would have been disastrous.</p><p></p><p>"The matter of the demonic Buddha can be put aside for now, as it is still confined within the Nine Curved Path, and I have enough time to prepare. Before that, I should first take care of the other matters!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had already formed a plan in his mind.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half a day later,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi appeared in the hall.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Your Highness!"</p><p></p><p>"This is a Transcendence Pill of the Grandmaster Realm. You have taken it, haven't you?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng casually tossed a Transcendence Pill to the other person, whose expression remained unchanged as he obediently took it, not even worried about whether there might be any issues with it.</p><p></p><p>This was the level of loyalty of these dedicated followers. When it came to Gu Qingfeng's orders, they would not hesitate at all.</p><p></p><p>After taking the pill.</p><p></p><p>The aura surrounding the other person suddenly erupted with tremendous force. Under Gu Qingfeng's watchful gaze, the surging energy of the other person rapidly ascended, breaking through the barriers of the Purified and Grandmaster realms in the blink of an eye, and stepping into the realm of the Innate Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Initial Grandmaster Realm!</p><p>Intermediate Grandmaster Realm!</p><p>Advanced Grandmaster Realm!</p><p>Grandmaster Peak!</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>All of this happened in just a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi had directly broken through from the Purified Realm to the peak of the Innate Grandmaster Realm.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng handed the Prajna Sutra to the other person.</p><p></p><p>"This is a Grandmaster cultivation technique. If you can cultivate it, it will help solidify your foundation. Even if you cannot break through to the Great Grandmaster Realm, it will at least enhance your strength to some degree."</p><p></p><p>Those who had broken through using the Transcendence Pill were the weakest among the peak Innate Grandmaster Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But if they could cultivate a technique at the same level, it would help compensate for the deficiencies in their foundation, and their strength would correspondingly increase.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Your Highness!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Yi solemnly accepted the Prajna Sutra. He could tell at a glance that this was a handwritten copy of the Grandmaster technique, not the original.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>This was sufficient.</p><p></p><p>A top-tier Grandmaster martial art would be enough to further advance his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "From now on, you will follow alongside Yang'er to prevent any powerful experts from launching a sneak attack. With your current strength, as long as no Spiritual Monarch-level cultivators intervene, I don't believe anyone can be your match."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, distribute all these pills to the other members of the Shadow Guard."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng then handed over 87 Transcendence Pills of the Purified Realm, 10 Transcendence Pills of the Purified Realm, and the last 2 Transcendence Pills of the Grandmaster Realm, all to Gu Yi.</p><p></p><p>With this.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Shadow Guard could be directly elevated by a large margin.</p><p></p><p>Prior to this.</p><p></p><p>The lower limit of the Shadow Guard's strength was at the peak of the Bone Refining Realm. Now, they had advanced to the peak of the Marrow Cleansing Realm.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly.</p><p></p><p>Any cultivator at the peak of the Marrow Cleansing Realm could be considered a top expert capable of dominating a region in Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention.</p><p></p><p>There were also 10 peak Purified Realm cultivators and 3 peak Innate Grandmaster Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>This enhancement was sufficient to make the overall strength of the Shadow Guard comparable to, or even surpass, many ancient family sects.</p><p></p><p>After all.</p><p></p><p>Even the ancient family sects of Guangyang Prefecture might not necessarily have Spiritual Monarch or Grandmaster Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>The so-called peak Spiritual Monarch cultivators, who could rival Grandmaster Realm experts, were only comparable to ordinary Grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>Beings at the peak of the Innate Grandmaster Realm like this could easily suppress any Spiritual Monarch or lower cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi took his leave as per the order.</p><p></p><p>"With the Shadow Guard as such a powerful force, Yang'er can now make a move against the major powers of Guangyang Prefecture with absolute protection."</p><p></p><p>"As long as it's not the top experts of the Tian Yang Sword Sect or the Imperial Court, the Shadow Guard's strength should be able to handle everything."</p><p></p><p>After resolving the safety issue for Gu Yang, Gu Qingfeng also felt a sense of relief.</p><p></p><p>As Gu Yang was his first offspring, Gu Qingfeng had a different kind of affection for him, which was not solely due to the Midas Touch.</p><p></p><p>Going forward.</p><p></p><p>Once the news of the White Stone Path spreads.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was certain that it would not only shake Guangyang Prefecture, but the entire Qingyun Province.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 66</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>These past few days, Gu Qingfeng has been staying at the Gu family cultivating the Qingyang Technique. Every day, he refines the great solar energy to temper his body, and the breakthrough of the Qingyang Technique is also remarkably fast.</p><p></p><p>In less than ten days, Gu Qingfeng has already completed the first layer of the Qingyang Technique.</p><p></p><p>With the completion of the first layer, a faint but scorching aura has emerged within Gu Qingfeng's qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>This scorching aura is different from the fierce solar palm energy of the Raging Sun Divine Palm. This aura comes from the great solar energy, which is the true essence of extreme yang power.</p><p></p><p>However, this aura is still too weak, far from the majestic qi and blood Gu Qingfeng currently possesses.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Qingfeng is not anxious, as when the Qingyang Technique reaches higher realms, the benefits will naturally manifest.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Gu Qingfeng has also been exploring the mysteries of refining the viscera.</p><p></p><p>Tempering the five viscera is a symbol of reaching the human body's limits.</p><p></p><p>To bear extraordinary power, one must have a sufficiently robust physique.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, after reaching the Refining Viscera realm, one can be considered a true master.</p><p></p><p>Whether it's an innate master or a qi and blood master, they have all broken through the limits of the human body.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng has not truly witnessed the methods of powerful masters, after entering the Refining Viscera realm, he seems to have gained a deeper understanding of the strength of masters.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Meng Peng hurriedly approached.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Family Head!"</p><p></p><p>"What has happened?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at Meng Peng's anxious expression, his brows slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng said, "News has come that there are problems at Mingyue Manor. In the past few days, there have been frequent disappearances of workers, and today some bodies were found, all of them brutally murdered.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, judging from the situation, it seems that this is not the work of ordinary jianghu figures."</p><p></p><p>"Not the work of ordinary jianghu figures?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes narrowed, and his expression turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"Why is this only being reported now that there are problems at Mingyue Manor?"</p><p></p><p>"Forgive me, Family Head. At first, we thought it was just a minor issue that could be resolved on our own, so we did not dare to trouble you. But now the situation has clearly escalated beyond what ordinary martial artists can handle, so I have come to report it to you."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the explanation, Meng Peng said hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not truly get angry, but he took the Zhu Xie Dao sword from the side.</p><p></p><p>"Today, you will carry this sword for me."</p><p></p><p>"It is an honor to carry the sword for the Family Head!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng's face showed a relieved smile.</p><p></p><p>As he said, being able to carry the sword for Gu Qingfeng is an immense honor.</p><p></p><p>This means that his status in Gu Qingfeng's eyes has risen another level.</p><p></p><p>With such a powerful figure as the mainstay, the Gu family is destined to grow stronger, and it may not be long before they become the top family in Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>In that case, the Gu family will surely be surrounded by powerful figures.</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng is well aware of his own limitations. Without any other fortuitous encounters, breaking through the Refining Blood realm would probably be his limit. Over time, his status in the Gu family would inevitably decline.</p><p></p><p>At this juncture, if he can firmly cling to Gu Qingfeng's coattails, he may have a chance to advance further in the future.</p><p></p><p>The jianghu rumors say that Gu Qingfeng is a Washing Marrow Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>But in Meng Peng's eyes, this person might not be as simple as the rumors suggest.</p><p></p><p>After being by Gu Qingfeng's side for many years, Meng Peng has come to realize the unfathomable depths of this man.</p><p></p><p>Mingyue Manor, which had been abandoned for decades, until recently...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Over time, the Gu family took possession of this place, finally allowing it to regain a bit of vitality.</p><p></p><p>The Mingri Manor was situated outside of Baishi City, with mountains on three sides and only one main entrance and exit road, making it an easily defensible location.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, this area had abundant water sources and enough fallow land to cultivate crops.</p><p></p><p>Normally, a place like this would not have been left abandoned for decades without anyone taking it over.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng arrived at this place, he was quite satisfied with the geographical location of Mingri Manor.</p><p></p><p>It had to be said that this was indeed a suitable location for the Gu family's future residence.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Meng Peng, who was following behind Gu Qingfeng, spoke up: "Mingri Manor covers more than three hundred mu of land, and the geographical location is also quite good. It's just a pity that there are rumors in the jianghu that this place is rather ominous and inauspicious, which is why it has been abandoned for so many years."</p><p></p><p>"Ominous and inauspicious? Then let me see what kind of thing is haunting Mingri Manor!" Gu Qingfeng said with a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>The moment he stepped into the boundaries of Mingri Manor, he did indeed sense a faint aura of coldness, but he was not particularly afraid.</p><p></p><p>If Mingri Manor was indeed haunted by a powerful evil entity, Gu Qingfeng was not afraid of it. With his current strength, he could directly suppress even a demonic entity.</p><p></p><p>According to the records in the Longevity Dao Classics, evil entities could be divided into several levels.</p><p></p><p>The lowest level was known as the Calamity-Causing Tier.</p><p></p><p>These weak evil entities were roughly on par with Blood Refining Realm martial artists, while the stronger ones could be comparable to Spirit Tamer Realm practitioners, able to stand shoulder to shoulder with Essence Corrupting Realm martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Above that were the Disaster-Bringing Tier evil entities.</p><p></p><p>These evil entities could not be dealt with by ordinary martial artists.</p><p></p><p>However, the appearance of Disaster-Bringing Tier evil entities would often lead to the collapse of an entire prefecture or even a province, so they would not appear easily.</p><p></p><p>And if such an evil entity did appear, it would not only devastate Mingri Manor, but the entire Baishi Dao region would likely become a living hell.</p><p></p><p>So, even if Mingri Manor was indeed haunted, the evil entity's power was likely limited.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, Gu Qingfeng and Meng Peng arrived in front of a manor.</p><p></p><p>The large plaque on the gate read "Gu Family Manor," clearly indicating this would be the Gu family's future residence.</p><p></p><p>However, upon closer inspection, it was evident that the Gu Family Manor was still in the early stages of construction, with many details yet to be fully completed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the guards stationed outside the Gu Family Manor saw the two arrivals and their faces lit up with joy, quickly bowing in greeting.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Take me to see the deceased," Gu Qingfeng said calmly, and the guard did not dare to hesitate, leading the two of them into the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall, there were more than a dozen bodies covered in white cloth.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng lifted the cloth, revealing a mummified corpse. The deceased was not old, but their eyes were wide open, and a look of terror was frozen on their face, as if they had seen something horrifying before their death.</p><p></p><p>Looking further, Gu Qingfeng could see that the person's chest had been cut open, and their internal organs had completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, Gu Qingfeng could sense a lingering aura of coldness within the wounds, similar to that of an evil entity.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to the evil entities Gu Qingfeng had encountered before, this aura seemed to have some differences.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

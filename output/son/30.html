        <h1>Chapter 30</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After Gu Qingfeng's words were spoken, many in the jianghu (martial arts world) sneered, believing that the Gu family's foundations were shallow. Even if Gu Qingfeng was known as the number one expert of the Baishi Sect, they thought it was just a delusional fantasy for him to truly dominate the entire Baishi Sect.</p><p></p><p>So, </p><p></p><p>many martial artists were waiting for three days later to witness the Gu family's downfall. </p><p></p><p>If no forces came to their aid, they would lose face, and it remained to be seen how the other side would resolve the situation.</p><p></p><p>On the other side,</p><p></p><p>when Qin Hongtang received this news, his expression also became gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"What is the Gu family thinking? Do they really believe that with just Gu Qingfeng, all the forces of the Baishi Sect will submit and obey them?"</p><p></p><p>Originally, according to the intentions of the Qin family's ancestor, with the Iron Bone Gang destroyed, the Qin family did not need to offend the Gu family. At that time, the Qin family would bring a generous gift to the Gu family, so that both sides could save face and then coexist peacefully.</p><p></p><p>But before Qin Hongtang could take any action, the Gu family had already made the first move.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, </p><p></p><p>if the Qin family were to submit, all the prestige they had accumulated over the years would be lost.</p><p></p><p>Right now,</p><p></p><p>the other Qin family elders also had unsightly expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Does Gu Qingfeng really think he is the number one expert of the Baishi Sect, and that the Gu family can dominate the entire Baishi Sect? I don't believe he dares to make a move!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, the Qin family is not made of mud either. We will only give the Gu family a bit of face and acknowledge their status in the Baishi Sect. If we don't give them face, what is the use of just Gu Qingfeng - "</p><p></p><p>The Qin family members were all indignant, and at the same time, they had a lot of disdain for the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>It's the same old story.</p><p></p><p>They felt that Gu Qingfeng had really become arrogant.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>no one believed that the Gu family really had the courage to make a move.</p><p></p><p>The Baishi Sect, though not small, is also not insignificant. Even if Gu Qingfeng's strength was so powerful, in the eyes of the Qin people, he still had no possibility of confronting the entire jianghu.</p><p></p><p>Qin Hongtang's expression was icy cold: "The Gu family's affairs do not need to be cared about. I want to see how Gu Qingfeng will end up!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Gu Qingfeng -"</p><p></p><p>Inside the Tianyun Sect, Cloud Longspace looked at the news from the Gu family with disdain all over his old face.</p><p></p><p>Standing before him</p><p></p><p>was Cloud Tianxing.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Elder, now that the Gu family has destroyed the Chu family and the Iron Bone Gang, and their momentum is rising, if we don't pay attention, will it bring some trouble?"</p><p></p><p>"When the sky is cloudy, the people will be in trouble. The Gu family has destroyed the Iron Bone Gang, so they are destined not to last long. Luo Yu is a person of the Divine Martial King, and although the Divine Martial King's main army has not yet entered Taishan Prefecture, a small Gu family daring to confront the Divine Martial King is just seeking death.</p><p></p><p>Once the news of the Iron Bone Gang's destruction spreads, I believe that without us even needing to act, the Divine Martial King will directly destroy the Gu family."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Longspace sneered.</p><p></p><p>Offending the Divine Martial King in this Qingyun State is a dead end.</p><p></p><p>If one were to say who the biggest force in Qingyun State is, apart from the imperial court, it would be the Divine Martial King.</p><p></p><p>He commands a million-strong army and controls three prefectures, with experts as numerous as the clouds. Not to mention a single Gu family, even ten or a hundred Gu families would not be a match for the Divine Martial King.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Tianxing's expression also became solemn.</p><p></p><p>He was well aware of the reputation of the Divine Martial King.</p><p></p><p>But if Cloud Longspace hadn't mentioned it, Cloud Tianxing wouldn't have known that the Iron Bone Gang was actually related to that person.</p><p></p><p>"So according to the Grand Elder's opinion, we don't need to care about the Gu family's affairs?"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Longspace nodded.</p><p></p><p>"No need to care. Gu Qingfeng has really underestimated the world. Let's see how he ends up in three days."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Gu family.</p><p></p><p>In the backyard.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The wind was cultivating the Heavenly Thunder Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>The weapon in his hand was an extraordinary divine weapon, called the Heavenly Dipper Sword, which was a mid-grade divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>Mid-grade divine weapons were rare.</p><p></p><p>At least they were considered rare in the White Stone Dao.</p><p></p><p>This divine weapon originally belonged to the Iron Bone Gang, but after the Iron Bone Gang was destroyed, Gu Qingfeng found this divine weapon in their treasury. Perfect.</p><p></p><p>Because Gu Yang had broken through the Refine Skin realm, Gu Qingfeng obtained a mid-grade martial art called the Heavenly Thunder Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>This mid-grade martial art was at the pinnacle level at this stage, much stronger than the ordinary mid-grade martial arts, on par with the Scorching Sun Divine Palm.</p><p></p><p>The difference was that the Scorching Sun Divine Palm was a cultivation of both internal and external aspects.</p><p></p><p>Not only could it temper one's qi and blood, improving the cultivator's attainment, but it also had a matching set of techniques. As for the Heavenly Thunder Sword Technique, it was completely focused on the techniques.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the exquisiteness of the techniques, it was even more advanced than the Scorching Sun Divine Palm.</p><p></p><p>Since obtaining the Heavenly Thunder Sword Technique, Gu Qingfeng had been constantly contemplating this supreme skill.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Heavenly Thunder Sword Technique was profoundly mysterious, and Gu Qingfeng had not been able to truly comprehend it so far.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, Gu Qingfeng was not too concerned.</p><p></p><p>He was aware that his natural talent was not high, and his comprehension was not particularly strong. For him to master such a mid-grade martial art was naturally not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, this time from the Chu family and the Iron Bone Gang, he had also obtained several other mid-grade martial arts, but Gu Qingfeng had no intention of cultivating these mid-grade martial arts for the time being.</p><p></p><p>After all, the essence of martial arts lies not in quantity, but in quality.</p><p></p><p>He had previously cultivated other low-grade martial arts mainly because his original martial art had reached a bottleneck and could no longer progress. But now, with the Heavenly Thunder Sword Technique still not mastered, cultivating other mid-grade martial arts would be a bit too greedy.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Gu Qingfeng had also passed on the complete Gu Family Fist to Meng Peng during this period.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, he had also passed on the Gu Family Fist to some of the guards who had joined the Gu family for a longer time and were more loyal.</p><p></p><p>With numerous mid-grade martial arts in hand, Gu Qingfeng no longer needed to cling to the Gu Family Fist alone.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing was that the Gu family now needed a sufficient number of powerful cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the vast Gu family would only have Gu Qingfeng at the half-step Refine Bone realm, and the rest were at the Refine Blood realm, which was simply not enough.</p><p></p><p>For this reason, Gu Qingfeng also bestowed ten Refine Blood pills to Meng Peng, allowing him to break through to the Refine Blood realm.</p><p></p><p>The remaining Refine Blood pills were mostly given to Gu Yang to accelerate his breakthrough to the Refine Blood realm.</p><p></p><p>As for himself, Gu Qingfeng rarely consumed Refine Blood pills for cultivation anymore.</p><p></p><p>Having reached the half-step Refine Bone realm, the effect of Refine Blood pills was limited.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the characteristics of the Scorching Sun Divine Palm, Gu Qingfeng could naturally advance to the Refine Bone realm without the need for any pills.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it was better to use the Refine Blood pills to cultivate more powerful members of the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>Among them, Gu Yang was the main target of Gu Qingfeng's cultivation efforts.</p><p></p><p>Whether Gu Qingfeng could break through to higher realms depended to a large extent on Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days had passed.</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng came walking in from outside.</p><p></p><p>"Your subordinate pays respects to the family master."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the changes in Meng Peng's aura and saw the gleam in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"You've broken through to the Refine Blood realm?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 153</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As the immortal sect of Qingyun State, the Tianyang Sword Sect was being watched by countless eyes in the shadows.</p><p></p><p>Any slight movement would be detected by the various forces.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Yutian has come out of seclusion!"</p><p></p><p>In the Commandery Governor's Office, Taishi Yi looked at the intelligence report in his hand and revealed a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yutian.</p><p></p><p>That was the name of the Sect Master of the Tianyang Sect.</p><p></p><p>These three words alone were enough to suppress Qingyun State and make the position of the immortal Tianyang Sword Sect unshakable.</p><p></p><p>In the Nine Prefectures of the world, there were a few immortal sects.</p><p></p><p>And Gu Yutian's strength was at the peak level.</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Yutian had occupied Guangyang Prefecture and proclaimed himself the King of Guangyang, he had become a threat to the Commandery Governor's Office.</p><p></p><p>After all, in Taishi Yi's eyes, Gu's ambition to contend for the world was extremely slim, even if he had a grand master behind him.</p><p></p><p>The struggle for the world had never been something that martial artists could interfere with.</p><p></p><p>Only with the support of the immortal sects could one have the hope of grasping the world.</p><p></p><p>But the Gu family manor behind Gu was a genuine martial artist force, which naturally put them at a disadvantage. Moreover, that grand master had now been exposed, and whether he could even survive was questionable.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in Taishi Yi's eyes, Gu had little chance of success.</p><p></p><p>Since it was a doomed force, he naturally could not submit to that Guangyang King.</p><p></p><p>In this way, if Gu led a large army to invade Taishan Commandery and threatened the Commandery Governor's Office, it would be tantamount to weakening the power of the Commandery Governor's Office.</p><p></p><p>Such a result was not in line with Taishi Yi's interests.</p><p></p><p>However, with a grand master behind Gu, the current Commandery Governor's Office could not shake him.</p><p></p><p>So, now that the Tianyang Sword Sect was making a move, and the Tianyang Sect Master himself was taking action, the problems facing Taishan Commandery would naturally disappear.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>"Tianyang Sword Sect!"</p><p>"Gu Yutian--"</p><p></p><p>Inside the Guangyang Prefecture capital, Gu Yang, now the King of Guangyang, looked at the intelligence report in his hand, his brows furrowed.</p><p></p><p>This result.</p><p></p><p>It was within his expectations.</p><p></p><p>It was just that upon learning of the Tianyang Sword Sect's actions, Gu Yang couldn't help but feel a sense of urgency.</p><p></p><p>There was no help for it.</p><p></p><p>The reputation of the immortal sects was too great.</p><p></p><p>Even though Gu Yang now commanded an army of 800,000 and had several pre-Celestial Realm masters, as well as a grand master behind him, he still lacked confidence.</p><p></p><p>The higher he stood, the more he could see.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he could also see the immense power of the immortal sects more clearly.</p><p></p><p>The depth of such sects was unfathomable, and their Sect Master, Gu Yutian, was a top expert in the Nine Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>Now, with Gu Yutian personally leading the Tianyang Sword Sect's experts here, his purpose was already clear.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi said, "The scouts reported that there was a bloody anomaly above the Tianyang Sword Sect a few days ago, and then Gu Yutian came out of seclusion."</p><p></p><p>"Now, Gu Yutian and a group of Tianyang Sword Sect experts are heading towards Guangyang Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>"According to the timing, the Tianyang Sword Sect will arrive within five days."</p><p></p><p>Pausing for a moment, Gu Yi continued, "Additionally, the undercover agents in other places have also received news that many strange experts have appeared in various parts of Qingyun State."</p><p></p><p>"According to some rumors, many of these strange experts are from the other eight prefectures, and their target is likely our Guangyang Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression turned icy cold: "Now that Father's status as a grand master has been revealed, these immortal sects and noble families must be restless. This matter is unavoidable, and they will come if they want to."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, I may need to report this to Father soon. After all, with Guangyang Prefecture's current strength, even with tens of thousands of troops and the pre-Celestial Realm masters in the undercover agents, we may not be able to suppress a Transformation Realm expert."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Mighty Ones of the Transformation Realm!</p><p></p><p>There was no other way. </p><p></p><p>The experts of the Transformation Realm were truly formidable and beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>These existences stood at the pinnacle of the world.</p><p></p><p>The Transformation Realm! The Grand Masters! To hold onto these two, it would be a mere fantasy to rely on some innate Grand Masters and hundreds of thousands of troops.</p><p></p><p>Unless...</p><p></p><p>If the other party was determined to fight to the death, otherwise, for these experts to leave, without experts of the same level stepping in, no one could stop them.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Guangyang Prefecture, the only one who had a chance of holding back such experts, in Gu Yang's view, was his father, who was a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>Butâ€”</p><p></p><p>Now, with the gaze of all the powerful experts in the world converging on Guangyang Prefecture, whether Gu Qingfeng could withstand such pressure, Gu Yang was not certain.</p><p></p><p>But in the current situation, he could only go all out.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had made some preparations.</p><p></p><p>The worst outcome would be if Gu Qingfeng was defeated by Gu Yutian.</p><p></p><p>In that case, </p><p></p><p>he would simply abandon the foundation of Guangyang Prefecture, go into hiding, and wait for the opportunity to rise again.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, </p><p></p><p>since the occupation of Guangyang Prefecture, Gu Yang had been secretly accumulating strength and planning for the future of himself and the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, </p><p></p><p>Gu Yang asked, "How many innate Grand Masters are there in the Shadow Guard now?"</p><p></p><p>It was a bit of a pity.</p><p></p><p>Although the Shadow Guard was under his command, Gu Yang himself was not entirely clear about how many powerful experts were within it.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, including us, the leaders, the Shadow Guard now has eleven innate Grand Masters!"</p><p></p><p>"Eleven Grand Masters!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang, even though he had already estimated the strength of the Shadow Guard as high as possible, couldn't help but take a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, </p><p></p><p>no one had expected the Shadow Guard to have eleven innate Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>The reason for this was that Gu Qingfeng had recently handed over the remaining eight Grand Master-level Promotion Elixirs to Gu Yi.</p><p></p><p>Eight Grand Master Promotion Elixirs.</p><p></p><p>They directly created eight innate Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>After the shock subsided, </p><p></p><p>Gu Yang took a deep breath and calmed his emotional turmoil.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Shadow Guard has such strength, let them replace me in patrolling Guangyang Prefecture. During this period, any forces within Guangyang Prefecture that dare to cause trouble will be suppressed without any mercy.</p><p></p><p>I want to see exactly which powers have the audacity to extend their hands to my Guangyang Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, I also order the various sects and noble families in Guangyang Prefecture to maintain stability in their own regions. If there is any disobedience, they will be severely punished!"</p><p></p><p>After learning that the Shadow Guard had eleven innate Grand Masters, Gu Yang completely unleashed his power.</p><p></p><p>Joke.</p><p></p><p>This force was already extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Although the Shadow Guard's current strength could not solve the problem of the Tianyang Sword Sect, </p><p></p><p>could they not solve the other forces?</p><p></p><p>In the vast Guangyang Prefecture, there had not been a single innate Grand Master stationed.</p><p></p><p>Such a level of expert, not only in Guangyang Prefecture, but even throughout the entire Qingyun State, belonged to the highest echelon of combat power, capable of founding their own sects and dominating a region.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Tianyang Sword Sect had launched an attack, and Guangyang Prefecture had just been conquered, Gu Yang knew clearly that there would definitely be people trying to take advantage of the situation and cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>However, </p><p></p><p>with the cooperation of the Shadow Guard and the various sects, even if someone dared to cause trouble, it would not stir up too much of a commotion.</p><p></p><p>As for whether the various forces in Guangyang Prefecture were willing to obey orders, Gu Yang had no doubts at all.</p><p></p><p>It was simple.</p><p></p><p>Those who didn't listen had already been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Now, any sects that were able to remain were all submissive to him.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng set up layer upon layer of spiritual barriers to ensure that his breakthrough would not cause any abnormal phenomena. He then calmed his mind and looked at his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng  Age: 52/6000  Realm: Dao Palace Realm 4th Layer  Martial Arts: Heaven Vein True Classic (2nd Layer), Heavenly Sword (Perfected), Great Wilderness Fist Classic (Perfected), Divine Yang Classic (Dao Palace 4th Layer), Primal Heavenly Sword (Beginner), Purple Extreme Dao Canon (Perfected), Departing Wind True Classic (Not Learned)  Upgrade Points: 2124...</p><p></p><p>"Upgrade!"</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Gu Qingfeng chose to upgrade the Primal Heavenly Sword.</p><p></p><p>Immediately.</p><p></p><p>Two thousand upgrade points were consumed.</p><p></p><p>A large amount of memories suddenly surfaced in Gu Qingfeng's mind, as if he had comprehended and cultivated the Primal Heavenly Sword for countless years. The vast and ancient sword intent also permeated throughout.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the spiritual barrier and Gu Qingfeng's deliberate control, this sword intent did not truly burst forth.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Dao Palace spiritual root was also growing.</p><p></p><p>In less than a moment, the spiritual root had reached its limit of thirty-six inches.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, Gu Qingfeng opened his eyes, a sense of maturity briefly appearing before dissipating.</p><p></p><p>Then, he turned his gaze inward to his Dao Palace, a smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual root has reached thirty-six inches, it seems this is the limit of my current Dao Palace Realm 4th Layer. But this is definitely not the limit of my mastery of the Primal Heavenly Sword. Once I have enough upgrade points, I can directly break through to the Dao Palace Realm 6th Layer!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had no doubt about this.</p><p></p><p>When he first learned the Primal Heavenly Sword, it allowed him to break through from the Dao Palace Realm 1st Layer to the 4th Layer in one go. Now that he had mastered the Primal Heavenly Sword, breaking through from the 4th Layer to the 6th Layer was a reasonable progression.</p><p></p><p>After all, the true power contained within the mastered Primal Heavenly Sword was vastly superior to the beginner stage.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Over the following days, Gu Qingfeng remained in the manor, overseeing the situation.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, more and more powerful cultivators arrived.</p><p></p><p>However, on the tenth day after the Great Saint's Forbidden Realm opened, the entrance to the realm closed. Although the portal remained, no cultivators were allowed to enter.</p><p></p><p>Some Deity Transformation Realm cultivators tried to forcibly enter, but they were instantly killed by the Great Saint's power the moment they stepped in.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other cultivators had no choice but to stop in their tracks.</p><p></p><p>They finally realized that this was a forbidden realm left behind by a fallen Great Saint, and even Dao Palace Realm cultivators would be annihilated if they tried to forcibly enter, let alone Deity Transformation Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Many newly arrived Deity Transformation Realm cultivators bitterly regretted, regretting that they had missed the chance by just a hair's breadth.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has been attacked by cultivators *215 times!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by cultivators *365 times!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' was ambushed by a Deity Transformation Realm 9th Layer cultivator, suffered severe injuries, and activated the power of the False Phoenix Divine Body, breaking through to perfection!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 120 upgrade points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' fought against and defeated a mid-stage Grand Monarch Realm cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' fought against and defeated a late-stage Grand Monarch Realm cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' slew a Deity Transformation Realm 9th Layer cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' comprehended the true meaning of life and death in battle, and the Heavenly Sword intent reached the 7th level!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' suffered severe injuries!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' once again activated the power of the False Phoenix Divine Body, breaking through to the early-stage Grand Monarch Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 200 upgrade points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by cultivators *688 times!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' slew a Deity Transformation Realm 5th Layer cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' consumed heavenly materials and treasures, breaking through to the late-stage Grand Monarch Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 500 upgrade points!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 100 True Intent Pills!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 100 Divine Blood Pills!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the information panel, his brow slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>After Gu Xuan and Gu Yang obtained the Great Saint's legacy, the frequency of attacks on them had increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>However, the good news was that despite the constant harassment, they had not encountered any major problems. Gu Xuan had been severely injured multiple times, but he always managed to recover and even break through.</p><p></p><p>As for the role of the Phoenix Divine Body, Gu Qingfeng now had some guesses.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Qingfeng looked at his own attribute panel and saw that the upgrade points, which had previously only been a little over a hundred, had now surged to over nine hundred.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he directly upgraded his cultivation to the Dao Palace Realm 5th Layer.</p><p></p><p>A mighty power awakened within Gu Qingfeng's physical body, and the powerful blood energy was even stronger than when he was at the Dao Palace Realm 4th Layer.</p><p></p><p>Looking at his Dao Palace spiritual root, it had now grown from thirty-six inches to forty-five inches.</p><p></p><p>This level was the limit of the Dao Palace Realm 5th Layer.</p><p></p><p>"As expected!"</p><p></p><p>"Mastering the Primal Heavenly Sword will not be a problem for me to break through to the Dao Palace Realm 6th Layer!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng thought to himself, a smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the Dao Palace Realm 5th Layer, his strength had increased significantly, making it much easier to deal with the cultivators of the Primal Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, the legacy of the Great Saint had fallen into Gu Xuan's hands, and once the forbidden realm ended, Gu Xuan would undoubtedly become the target of many.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Gu Qingfeng needed to do his best to further enhance his strength in order to resolve the upcoming problems.</p><p></p><p>"I've really been worrying myself sick over you two. If you can be a bit more diligent, maybe you can even break through to the Deity Transformation Realm by taking advantage of the opportunities in the forbidden realm!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured to himself as he looked at the information panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Great Saint's Forbidden Realm, in a certain desolate mountain.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was standing guard, while Gu Xuan was sitting in meditation, seemingly recovering from his injuries.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Gu Xuan opened his eyes, exhaling a mouthful of turbid air. His previously pale complexion had now become ruddy.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, big brother, for guarding me."</p><p></p><p>"The Phoenix Divine Body is truly wondrous, for you to recover so quickly from such injuries."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at the fully recovered Gu Xuan, his expression somewhat emotional.</p><p></p><p>He had recently obtained the Great Saint's precious legacy and was then pursued by other cultivators. Using the Great Saint's treasure and the precautions left behind by Gu Qingfeng, Gu Yang had been fighting and retreating.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, he encountered the also-pursued Gu Xuan.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the two of them fled together.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fate.</p><p></p><p>Half a day ago.</p><p></p><p>They were besieged by hundreds of cultivators, with dozens of Shenbian realm experts among them. Although the two possessed many techniques, their cultivation was too low, and Gu Xuan was severely injured by one of the Shenbian realm experts.</p><p></p><p>At a critical moment.</p><p></p><p>The Zhuxie Knife erupted with terrifying divine might, allowing the two to carve a bloody path out.</p><p></p><p>After that.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang followed the guidance of the Saint's Treasure and entered this desolate mountain.</p><p></p><p>This mountain may seem ordinary, but it is filled with the aura of the Saint. It was the place where the Great Saint Tianfeng once secluded himself. Without the guidance, recklessly entering would easily trigger the Saint's aura and lead to instant death.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely because of the mountain's aura that the two have a chance to catch their breath.</p><p></p><p>Afterward.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang protected the path for Gu Xuan, allowing him to recover.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Gu Xuan had fully recovered from his severe injuries in less than a day, Gu Yang was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>After all, with such serious injuries, ordinary cultivators would either die or be on the verge of death, unable to recover so quickly without prolonged cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan smiled and said, "The Tianfeng Divine Body emphasizes rebirth through nirvana. If one sustains grave injuries, as long as they have a breath of life left, they can recover at a rate far exceeding ordinary people, and may even have a chance to break through their cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"But alas..."</p><p></p><p>"The Tianfeng Divine Body I possess is only cultivated later on, not the true Tianfeng Divine Body. The phoenix blood within me is limited, and cannot be compared to the real Tianfeng Divine Body!"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Gu Xuan also sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Tianfeng Divine Body is indeed powerful! He deeply understands this.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, the Tianfeng Divine Body he possesses is only a false one, created by the methods of the Great Saint Tianfeng, with a significant gap compared to the real one.</p><p></p><p>Afterward.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan looked outside the desolate mountain, his expression somewhat grave.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, do you think this place can withstand those cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>Now that his cultivation has broken through, Gu Xuan can sense many cultivators assaulting the mountain.</p><p></p><p>As for whether this desolate mountain can withstand these cultivators, Gu Xuan is not confident.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression remained calm: "This place was guided here by the Shenhuang Tower. It is where the Great Saint Tianfeng once secluded himself, and the Saint's aura still remains. </p><p></p><p>Even if it has been weathered by time, the aura left behind should not be something ordinary cultivators can contend with."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore—"</p><p></p><p>"If the Saint's aura here truly cannot stop these cultivators, then we shall make other arrangements!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Gu Xuan, Gu Yang's actions are much more composed. Even when besieged by many cultivators on the mountain, he shows no panic.</p><p></p><p>The reason he can remain so calm is not only because he has held a high position for a long time, but also because the Great Saint's secret realm is about to close.</p><p></p><p>Every cultivator who enters the Great Saint's secret realm will receive a message left by the Great Saint Tianfeng, knowing that the secret realm will only be open for a month.</p><p></p><p>After a month.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators within the secret realm will be directly expelled.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang calculated the time, and they have been in the secret realm for about twenty days.</p><p></p><p>In that case.</p><p></p><p>As long as they can hold out for another ten days, they can leave the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>Even if they do leave the secret realm, things won't be that simple.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Saint's Treasure and legacy have fallen into the hands of the two brothers, once the secret realm ends, this news will surely spread.</p><p></p><p>But at this point, there is no room for retreat.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang remains unperturbed.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Xuan's expression relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>The void trembled.</p><p></p><p>Numerous divine lights surged towards the mountain, fiercely bombarding it. In an instant, the aura of the mountain rose up, blocking all the divine lights.</p><p></p><p>The collision of the two forces caused the void to twist violently.</p><p></p><p>Such a great disturbance also made Gu Yang and Gu Xuan's expressions change.</p><p></p><p>"Ancient Weapons!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems they have also realized that the Great Saint's secret realm is about to end, and want to completely annihilate us here!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's face darkened.</p><p></p><p>Now, he naturally understands why the Ancient Weapons.</p><p></p><p>They are divine weapons forged by Daogong realm experts. Any Ancient Weapon contains terrifying power, and if wielded by a Shenbian realm cultivator, it would be easy to suppress and kill stronger opponents.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>If they recklessly unleash the divine might of the Ancient Weapons, they may even be able to display attacks comparable to the Daogong realm.</p><p></p><p>For the cultivators of the Huagu Realm, any Ancient Weapon is extremely precious, not something ordinary cultivators can possess.</p><p></p><p>But now, among the cultivators who have entered the Great Saint's secret realm, there are many geniuses from top factions, and these cultivators possess Ancient Weapons for protection, which is only natural.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>From Gu Yang's dantian, an ancient tower suddenly surged out, appearing in the sky above the mountain in the blink of an eye. The next moment, a majestic divine aura permeated the mountain, merging with the various auras.</p><p></p><p>Instantly.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the mountain's dao increased tremendously.</p><p></p><p>All the divine lights that bombarded it were directly shattered by a terrifying pressure, revealing the numerous Ancient Weapons within.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after.</p><p></p><p>Numerous cracks appeared on the Ancient Weapons, and then, before everyone's eyes, these Ancient Weapons all shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Boom—"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Weapons crumbled, scattering countless fragments in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"No!!"</p><p></p><p>Outside the mountain, many cultivators turned pale, watching the shattered Ancient Weapons, their hearts feeling as if they had been cut by a knife.</p><p></p><p>They never expected the Shenhuang Tower to suddenly appear and, together with the mountain's dao aura, shatter so many Ancient Weapons.</p><p></p><p>Even for the geniuses of various factions, the loss of an Ancient Weapon here is enough to cause them immense pain.</p><p></p><p>"You've ruined my Shanguan family's Ancient Weapon, these two must die!" </p><p></p><p>A purple-robed youth looked at the shattered Ancient Weapon, his handsome face becoming ferocious, his eyes filled with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>When he looked at the Shenhuang Tower in the void, the youth's eyes also revealed a greedy expression.</p><p></p><p>"The Saint's Treasure!"</p><p></p><p>"Such a precious treasure should belong to me!"</p><p></p><p>An impulse arose in Shanguan Yu's heart, wanting to directly seize the Shenhuang Tower, as this Saint's Treasure is something the Shanguan family has never possessed.</p><p></p><p>If he could obtain a Saint's Treasure to protect himself, then when the great competition comes in the future, ascending to sainthood would definitely be no problem.</p><p></p><p>Even.</p><p></p><p>There is a chance that he could step into the Saint realm and become an existence on par with the Great Saint Tianfeng.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Shanguan Yu looked at the other cultivators and immediately said to the Shenbian realm experts of the Shanguan family beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Have the other cultivators enter the mountain, and make sure they find a way to enter it. If they are unwilling, then they have no need to live!"</p><p></p><p>Shanguan Yu's expression was cold.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Shanguan family's experts immediately obeyed the order and went towards the other scattered cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Such an action naturally caused no small commotion.</p><p></p><p>But with the reputation of a saint family, and under the coercion of the Shanguan family's many experts, some scattered cultivators reluctantly stepped into the mountain, while also harboring great resentment towards the Shanguan family.

        <h1>Chapter 223</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This martial art technique is on par with the Purple Extreme Dao Canon, both being pinnacle techniques that directly point to the Realm of Divine Transformation's ninth layer.</p><p></p><p>It is quite obvious.</p><p></p><p>This is the opportunity that Gu Yang has obtained.</p><p></p><p>The other party had someone bring this martial art technique over, and the purpose is also self-evident.</p><p></p><p>After Gu Qingfeng's divine sense read through the techniques within, he saw the jade slip dim slightly, but not to the point of true shattering.</p><p></p><p>It can be seen.</p><p></p><p>This jade slip can still be passed down multiple times.</p><p></p><p>"Is there anything else?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng casually put away the jade slip and then asked.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng respectfully said, "His Majesty has said that the calamity of ferocious beasts in the Nine States is becoming increasingly severe. Although the court has stepped in to suppress it, it is only a temporary relief of the urgent crisis.</p><p></p><p>If the Patriarch were to come out of seclusion, His Majesty hopes that the Patriarch can go to the imperial capital for a visit!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"This matter has already come to my attention. If there is nothing else, you may take your leave first!"</p><p></p><p>"I take my leave, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng respectfully withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng summoned Gu Wu and the others, and at the same time handed a jade box the size of a palm to one of them.</p><p></p><p>"You all can go to the imperial palace and temporarily serve under Gu Yang. Also, deliver this item to him."</p><p></p><p>"We will obey the order, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Wu and the others did not ask further questions and immediately accepted the order with a fist salute.</p><p></p><p>After they had left, Gu Qingfeng went out to the main hall, looking towards the direction of the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, his eyes narrowing slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The unrest of the ferocious beasts!"</p><p></p><p>"Could my guess be true?"</p><p></p><p>Intuitively, Gu Qingfeng had a sixth sense telling him that something was about to happen.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Hongye arrived, directly handing over the intelligence gathered by the secret guards during this period to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>After reading through the intelligence, Gu Qingfeng's expression became clear.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, this matter is not as simple as it seems. The rampage of the ferocious beasts is caused by someone manipulating things behind the scenes!"</p><p></p><p>In the secret guard's intelligence, although the mastermind behind the ferocious beast uprising was hidden, after further investigation, they did discover some clues.</p><p></p><p>Some secret guards even went into the Ancient Beast Mountain Range to try to understand the situation better, but in the end, they disappeared without a trace, their fate obvious.</p><p></p><p>"Continue to monitor the movements of the ferocious beasts."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng instructed Hongye and then let him leave.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' met with the four elders of the Gu Family Manor, and learned that the four were Realm of Divine Transformation ninth layer experts, greatly delighting him in his heart!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' obtained the jade box you had given him, greatly boosting his confidence, and was also shocked by your strength, once again marveling at your profound and unfathomable abilities!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' mutually verified his martial dao with the experts, and his cultivation has improved slightly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' consumed the True Meaning Pill, and his Tyrannical Saber breakthrough to the Great Perfection, comprehending the eighth level of True Meaning!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Xuan' was attacked by ferocious beasts*695!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Xuan' received the transmission of an unparalleled technique from a Realm of Divine Transformation ninth layer expert, greatly increasing his strength!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Xuan' fought a life-and-death battle, breaking through the fifth level of the Heavenly Dao Saber's True Meaning, and slaying a fifth-stage Refining Impurity Beast!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendants..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The text on the information panel kept refreshing, and Gu Qingfeng was increasingly able to understand that the information panel was indeed more comprehensive than before.</p><p></p><p>Although there was no prompt, the differences from the past could be detected from the lines of text.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Gu Yang had already met with Gu Wu and the others, Gu Qingfeng also temporarily put his mind at ease.</p><p></p><p>The four Realm of Divine Transformation ninth layer experts were at the peak of the ninth layer, and if they were to break through further, they would reach the Dao Palace Realm, their foundation being even more solid than ordinary Realm of Divine Transformation ninth layer cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Sending the four to the imperial palace was to have them protect Gu Yang, and as for how Gu Yang would arrange things, it would all depend on the other party.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng continued to ponder the Primordial Heavenly Saber.</p><p></p><p>Although he had already entered the door of this Saint's supreme technique, it was still not enough.</p><p></p><p>If he could take the Primordial Heavenly Saber even further, then the problems he would face in the future would be much easier to handle.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Blue Cloud State, in a certain city within Guangyang Prefecture, there were two people, one old and one young, sitting in an inn.</p><p></p><p>"According to the records of my Returning Origin Imperial Dynasty, the spiritual qi in the Nine States should be scarce, and cultivation should have declined, but unexpectedly, there is now also the existence of a dynasty of auspicious fate in the Nine States, which is quite unexpected!"</p><p></p><p>Han An picked up the teacup and took a sip, finding the taste somewhat unpalatable, but remembering the remote and desolate nature of this place, he suppressed the dissatisfaction in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of this, Han An's eyes flickered slightly.</p><p></p><p>"A dynasty of auspicious fate has already condensed the third-grade Cyan Lotus. If the full national strength is mobilized, even Realm of Divine Transformation ninth layer experts can be contended against.</p><p></p><p>Elder Ke, do you have confidence in this?"</p><p></p><p>At the last sentence, Han An looked at the elder in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The other party was dressed in gray clothes, with a plain and ordinary appearance. If others saw him, they would only think of him as an ordinary old man.</p><p></p><p>"From the information obtained, the Shen Wu Dynasty has been established for less than two years, and even if its foundation is strong, it is limited. The strongest person in the Nine States now is called Gu Qingfeng, known as the Martial Saint throughout the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>Based on his achievements, his strength should be at the Realm of Divine Transformation, at most not exceeding the sixth layer!"</p><p></p><p>"Even if he is at the sixth layer of the Realm of Divine Transformation, coupled with a newly established dynasty, it is still not enough to pose a great threat to this old man!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Ke said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>In his mouth, the Shen Wu Dynasty was like a clay chicken and a tile dog, which he could easily suppress.</p><p></p><p>This was something Elder Ke was absolutely confident about.</p><p></p><p>As a palace attendant of the Returning Origin Imperial Dynasty, although he had not reached the Dao Palace Realm, he was still above ordinary Realm of Divine Transformation cultivators, at the threshold of the Dao Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>With such strength, he was already dominant in the Primordial Realm.</p><p></p><p>On this small piece of land in the Nine States, he was more than capable of sweeping everything aside.</p><p></p><p>Han An nodded slightly upon hearing this: "Unexpectedly, the true inheritance of the Saint Yang Sacred Land from thousands of years ago should be related to the Shen Wu Dynasty. Otherwise, with the current situation in the Nine States, how would the Shen Wu Dynasty have the qualifications to establish a dynasty of auspicious fate."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps that Saint's inheritance has also fallen into the hands of the Shen Wu Dynasty."</p><p></p><p>"Once we capture the lord of the Shen Wu Dynasty and force him to reveal his soul, our Returning Origin Imperial Dynasty can take the Saint's inheritance ahead of time."</p><p></p><p>Finally, a cold smile appeared on Han An's face.</p><p></p><p>The reason he was so familiar with the Nine States was because of the information obtained through soul searching.</p><p></p><p>The sudden rise of the Shen Wu Dynasty was abrupt.</p><p></p><p>Han An could see at a glance that something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of years ago, the martial dao in the Nine States had declined, but after the appearance of that mysterious Martial Ancestor, who spread his martial arts throughout the land, the martial dao in the Nine States gradually flourished.</p><p></p><p>This time period coincided with the destruction of the Saint Yang Sacred Land.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, by comparing the two, many things could be deduced.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Han An planned to go to the Shen Wu Sect for a visit.</p><p></p><p>But now, instead of wasting time going to the Shen Wu Sect, it would be better to go directly to the capital of the Shen Wu Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>"Currently, Elder Ke is using his beast-controlling techniques to have the ferocious beasts in the Ancient Beast Mountain Range search for the location of the Nine States. Our Returning Origin Imperial Dynasty has taken the lead, but now there are many cultivators entering the Ancient Beast Mountain Range. If other cultivators also find the location of the Nine States, it will be a troublesome matter."</p><p></p><p>Han An's expression became more solemn, as the forces vying for the Saint's inheritance were numerous. If it were not for Elder Ke's mastery of beast-controlling techniques, driving many ferocious beasts in the Ancient Beast Mountain Range to search for the location of the Nine States, he would not have been able to find this place so quickly.</p><p></p><p>But there were many powerful cultivators in the Primordial Realm, and who could guarantee that other cultivators did not have the means to find the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>To take the lead.</p><p></p><p>To always be one step ahead.</p><p></p><p>Han An did not want to waste time.</p><p></p><p>Elder Ke nodded upon hearing this: "The Sixth Prince's words are correct. Let us go directly to the capital of the Shen Wu Dynasty!"</p><p></p><p>The two of them then stepped into the air and flew towards the direction of the Shen Wu Dynasty's capital.</p><p></p><p>This scene shocked all the onlooking commoners.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the secret guards quickly transmitted this news back.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In less than half a day, the two arrived at the capital.</p><p></p><p>Han An looked at the prosperous scene before him, his eyes filled with a hint of disdain: "Such a capital, with only so-called Sect Masters and Great Sect Masters, shows the weakness of the Shen Wu Dynasty."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Han An looked towards the direction of the imperial palace. That was where the most abundant auspicious fate was concentrated.</p><p></p><p>Elder Ke shook his head and said, "The Shen Wu Dynasty's foundation is ultimately shallow, and it cannot be compared to the Returning Origin Imperial Dynasty."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the two of them directly headed towards the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to enter the imperial city, the guards stopped them. Before the guards could even question them, they saw Elder Ke's eyes turn cold, and a terrifying aura burst forth. Several guards screamed, but their flesh bodies exploded without even a sound.</p><p></p><p>Blood and flesh scattered.</p><p></p><p>This commotion immediately alerted the imperial city guards.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to trespass the imperial city!"</p><p></p><p>"Rebellious traitors, you shall be executed!"</p><p></p><p>A large number of imperial guards appeared, and at the forefront were several Sect Master-level experts. Seeing the bloody remains on the ground, as well as Han An and the others, the leading Sect Master's eyes turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"Capture them alive!"</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, a large number of guards rushed towards the two, intending to subdue them.</p><p></p><p>"Insignificant insects, how dare you raise your hand against the Imperial Prince!"</p><p></p><p>Han An sneered disdainfully. Without waiting for Elder Ke to act, he casually slapped out, and a destructive power was unleashed, instantly blasting over a hundred guards to death on the spot.</p><p></p><p>This scene caused the leading Sect Masters to have their pupils contract.</p><p></p><p>"This youth is ruthless. Fellow Daoists, do not hold back. Capture him first, then we'll deal with him!"</p><p></p><p>One of the Sect Masters roared, taking the lead in charging towards Han An. However, this Sect Master-level full-force attack was only met with Han An's contemptuous smile.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, Han An raised his right hand, and with a clenching of his fingers in the air, the Sect Master's face suddenly turned red, his body rapidly contracting, as if grasped by an invisible giant hand.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Han An clenched his fingers tightly, and the Sect Master's flesh body exploded, with blood and flesh scattering everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Masters are merely insects!"</p><p></p><p>Han An revealed a morbid smile on his face, taking pleasure in the slaughter of the weak.</p><p></p><p>The other Sect Masters who were about to attack saw this and their faces instantly turned pale.</p><p></p><p>Effortlessly crushing Sect Masters</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Killing a Sect Master. It would be difficult even for most great Sect Masters to accomplish.</p><p></p><p>No wonder! The two before them had the courage to brazenly invade the Imperial City.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you two?" </p><p></p><p>One of the Sect Masters forcibly calmed himself and asked in a stern tone towards Han An.</p><p></p><p>Han An stood with his hands behind his back, saying in a contemptuous tone, "I am the Sixth Prince of the Returning Origin Imperial Dynasty. Have Gu Yang come and pay his respects immediately, or I will destroy your Divine Martial Dynasty!"</p><p></p><p>The Returning Origin Imperial Dynasty!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this name, several Sect Masters were filled with uncertainty and doubt, as this name was completely unfamiliar to them.</p><p></p><p>However, the disrespect in Han An's words angered them.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a terrifying aura burst forth from within the Imperial City, and a chilling voice followed.</p><p></p><p>"Audacious ruffians, daring to spout such madness here and show disrespect to His Majesty, this crime shall be punished!"</p><p></p><p>With that, a terrifying palm strike suddenly descended, with overwhelming power that even caused the space to crack like a spider's web, as if it would shatter at any moment.</p><p></p><p>This strike made Han An's expression change.</p><p></p><p>Even the unperturbed Ke Lao behind him had a serious look.</p><p></p><p>"You shall not harm the Sixth Prince!"</p><p></p><p>He stepped forward, and his right hand struck out with another palm, the two palm forces colliding, causing the space to violently shatter, with rolling shockwaves sweeping in all directions, forcing everyone to retreat.</p><p></p><p>"Ninth Layer of Divine Transformation!"</p><p></p><p>Ke Lao looked at the appearing Gu Wu with slight surprise.</p><p></p><p>Based on the information he had gathered, the strongest of the Divine Martial Dynasty should be the one revered as the Martial Saint, Gu Qingfeng. But Ke Lao also recognized Gu Qingfeng's appearance.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, according to his calculations, the Martial Saint's strength should not exceed the Sixth Layer of Divine Transformation.</p><p></p><p>Yet the person before him was a Ninth Layer Divine Transformation expert, which Ke Lao had not anticipated.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Han An's expression also changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Ninth Layer of Divine Transformation!"</p><p></p><p>"How could such a small Divine Martial Dynasty have such a powerful expert?"</p><p></p><p>Even in the Returning Origin Imperial Dynasty, Ninth Layer Divine Transformation experts were not many.</p><p></p><p>Now, a Divine Martial Dynasty had produced a Ninth Layer Divine Transformation expert, which left Han An completely unexpected.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Ke Lao quickly reacted, with the aura of a Half-Step Dao Palace expert permeating him.</p><p></p><p>"The Ninth Layer of Divine Transformation is indeed formidable, but it still falls short before me. My Returning Origin Imperial Dynasty has even stronger Dao Palace experts as our mainstay. I have come on a mission, and I wish to have an audience with the Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>Although Ke Lao was not afraid of a Ninth Layer Divine Transformation expert, he did not want to truly tear off the other party's mask. So he directly stated his strength and invoked the might of the Returning Origin Imperial Dynasty behind him to intimidate the other side.</p><p></p><p>The logic was simple.</p><p></p><p>This was the Divine Martial Dynasty, and the auspices of a dynasty were not to be underestimated. Add to that a Ninth Layer Divine Transformation expert, and even a Half-Step Dao Palace expert would find it troublesome.</p><p></p><p>So, in Ke Lao's view, if the matter could be resolved peacefully, that would be the best.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the reason for all this was Gu Wu's appearance.</p><p></p><p>If there had not been this Ninth Layer Divine Transformation expert, Ke Lao would not have wasted his breath.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Wu's expression remained cold: "This is the Divine Martial Dynasty, it is not your Returning Origin Imperial Dynasty's place to act recklessly. Today, you have dared to commit murder at the gates of the Imperial City. If you are wise, you will surrender."</p><p></p><p>"What a bold tone, a mere dynasty dares to be so presumptuous!" </p><p></p><p>Ke Lao laughed angrily, his gaze towards Gu Wu filled with icy killing intent.</p><p></p><p>He did not want to clash with Gu Wu, but he was not afraid to fight him either.</p><p></p><p>"Since you insist on being shameless, then I shall subdue you first—"</p><p></p><p>Just as Ke Lao was about to make his move, several more powerful auras burst forth from within the Imperial City, causing Ke Lao's expression to stiffen, his pupils involuntarily widening, filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Four Ninth Layer Divine Transformation experts!"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible—"</p><p></p><p>When he saw Gu Dao and the others appear, Ke Lao's forehead immediately broke out in sweat.</p><p></p><p>Four Ninth Layer Divine Transformation experts! This was something he had completely not anticipated.</p><p></p><p>If it had been only Gu Wu, Ke Lao would have had the confidence to deal with him. But with four Ninth Layer Divine Transformation experts, it was a completely different story.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Half-Step Dao Palace realm was still within the Divine Transformation realm.</p><p></p><p>At this level, even with half a foot in the Dao Palace realm, one had not truly broken through, and their strength would not be vastly superior to ordinary Ninth Layer Divine Transformation experts.</p><p></p><p>So, the moment Gu Wu's group appeared, Ke Lao realized that the situation had gone beyond his control.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, the originally arrogant and overbearing Han An also had a change of expression.</p><p></p><p>He understood that this time, he was in deep trouble.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Wu's group directly attacked, moving to suppress Ke Lao, as they did not take a Half-Step Dao Palace expert lightly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the three attack, Ke Lao's entire aura erupted, and his previously aged body now gave an illusion of youthfulness. With a wave of his hand, a divine sword appeared, its brilliant sword qi tearing through the void.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Gu Long had already attacked Han An.</p><p></p><p>With a Ninth Layer Divine Transformation cultivation, facing a Sixth Layer Divine Transformation cultivator like Han An was an effortless task.</p><p></p><p>Even if the latter had some trump cards, they would not be able to stir up much of a storm.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Han An was about to be completely suppressed, he suddenly hardened his expression and crushed a jade talisman.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A towering phantom suddenly appeared, emanating a terrifying abyss-like aura, and a palm strike pressed down on Gu Long, the sheer power of which made the latter's expression turn solemn.</p><p></p><p>The aura bursting forth from the phantom was actually at the Ninth Layer of Divine Transformation, and even stronger than ordinary Ninth Layer Divine Transformation experts.</p><p></p><p>The moment the phantom appeared, Han An did not dare to linger and immediately fled outwards from the capital.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, within the Imperial City, an ancient cauldron suddenly appeared, pressing down towards Han An.</p><p></p><p>"Ancient Artifact!"</p><p></p><p>Han An's expression changed slightly, and he immediately took out a divine spear from his storage ring, colliding it with the ancient cauldron.</p><p></p><p>The two treasures clashed, unleashing terrifying fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>In the next instant, the ancient cauldron was sent flying back.</p><p></p><p>Han An's retreating figure also paused.</p><p></p><p>Before he could make another move, Gu Yang appeared in the air, opening a jade box in his hand, and a severed finger was summoned, pressing down towards the former.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a severed finger, in Han An's eyes, it seemed to occupy his entire vision, emanating a majestic aura that made him change color.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Palace Remnant!"</p><p></p><p>Han An never imagined that this small Divine Martial Dynasty not only had four Ninth Layer Divine Transformation experts guarding it, but also possessed a Dao Palace realm remnant.</p><p></p><p>At the Dao Palace realm level, even a mere remnant would possess earth-shaking power.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the aura emanating from this severed finger made Han An feel an extremely terrifying presence.</p><p></p><p>This aura was even stronger than some of the Dao Palace realm experts in the Returning Origin Imperial Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, this severed finger was not as simple as a regular Dao Palace realm item.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the severed finger descending, Han An did not hesitate to mobilize his full blood and qi, his divine spear piercing through the void, trying to block this terrifying strike.</p><p></p><p>But alas, in the face of absolute power, any struggle was futile.</p><p></p><p>In just an instant, the divine spear shattered.</p><p></p><p>A treasure on par with ancient artifacts was suddenly destroyed, and the powerful force struck Han An, sending him flying and vomiting blood, having suffered heavy injuries.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Yang about to strike again to kill him, Han An no longer cared about his dignity, his expression filled with terror as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Don't kill me!! I am the Sixth Prince of the Returning Origin Imperial Dynasty—"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang's expression slightly changed, and then the severed finger was retracted back into the jade box.</p><p></p><p>Compared to before, the finger now appeared much paler, and the blood on it seemed to have dried up to some extent.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the power of the finger could not be casually used.</p><p></p><p>But even so, seeing the finger suppress a Divine Transformation expert, Gu Yang was still somewhat shocked.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the finger belonged to Gu Qingfeng, and he also knew that Divine Transformation experts could regenerate severed limbs.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Yang never imagined that Gu Qingfeng's severed finger would possess such divine might.</p><p></p><p>This showed just how unfathomable his father's true strength was.</p><p></p><p>All along, whenever Gu Yang thought he had grasped Gu Qingfeng's abilities, the latter would reveal even more terrifying depths.</p><p></p><p>Just like recently, when the four Ninth Layer Divine Transformation Elders emerged from the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>And now, a severed finger suppressing a Divine Transformation expert.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Yang quickly suppressed the thoughts in his heart, and then said to the nearby Gu Long, "Please have Elder Gu Long subdue this person."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Long obeyed the order, and then went to Han An, directly suppressing the latter's entire blood and qi.</p><p></p><p>Faced with this situation, Han An did not dare to resist at all.</p><p></p><p>Ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>Given the current circumstances, if he cooperated, he might have a chance to survive. But if he resisted, it would be a dead end.</p><p></p><p>What truly made Han An feel hopeless was the Dao Palace realm severed finger in Gu Yang's hand.</p><p></p><p>The fact that the other party possessed such a treasure meant that the Divine Martial Dynasty also had a powerful Dao Palace realm expert backing them.</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, the situation would become even more difficult.</p><p></p><p>As Han An was being apprehended, Ke Lao was being pushed back by Gu Wu's group, though as a Half-Step Dao Palace expert, it was not easy to directly defeat him.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Gu Yang had Gu Long join in, and together they suppressed Ke Lao.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Long's addition, it became the final straw that broke the camel's back.</p><p></p><p>Facing the joint forces of four Ninth Layer Divine Transformation experts, even a Half-Step Dao Palace expert found it difficult to withstand. After a moment, Ke Lao was heavily injured by a palm strike from Gu Wu, and his entire cultivation was sealed, causing him to collapse to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ke Lao defeated and captured, Han An's expression became increasingly desperate.

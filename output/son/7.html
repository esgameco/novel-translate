        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Over the next three days, Gu Qingfeng did not go to the Golden Bull Martial Arts Hall, but instead quietly refined and absorbed the Blood Refining Elixir, wanting to break through to the Blood Refining Realm as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>However, although the Blood Refining Elixir was powerful, the breakthrough from the Skin Refining Realm to the Blood Refining Realm was not something that could be achieved in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Given that Gu Qingfeng had refined three Blood Refining Elixirs within three days, he could clearly feel that his cultivation had reached the limit of the Skin Refining Realm, and he only needed one more opportunity to complete that tremendous transformation.</p><p></p><p>But this final step of transformation was not easy to accomplish.</p><p></p><p>If he had a few more days, Gu Qingfeng would have a good chance of breaking through to the Blood Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not have that much time now.</p><p></p><p>Because today was the day he had agreed to meet with Xu Jun.</p><p></p><p>With the other disciples of the martial arts hall acting as bait and sacrifices, the probability of safely leaving Linxian County would be much higher. Even if he broke through to the Blood Refining Realm, Gu Qingfeng would not be confident of leaving Linxian County safely without Xu Jun and the others.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, after understanding Xu Jun's intentions, Gu Qingfeng had the same plan as the other party. Xu Jun saw him and the other disciples as bait, and Gu Qingfeng was no different in his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>In this chaotic world, deaths were commonplace. In the past thirty years, Gu Qingfeng had seen many dead people, so he did not have much emotional response to it.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Gu Qingfeng simply packed his belongings, which did not amount to much, except for some silver taels.</p><p></p><p>Then, he took Gu Yang and went out.</p><p></p><p>Compared to three days ago, the sky above Linxian County could now be seen with a faint bloody mist, and the people on the streets had anxious and distressed expressions, but the order had not yet descended into chaos.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not want to care about too much now, he just wanted to leave Linxian County as soon as possible, as the bloody mist had already appeared in the sky, and no one could guarantee when the next crisis would occur.</p><p></p><p>As for Gu Yang, when he saw the bloody mist, his bright eyes revealed a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>"Father, what is that thing?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry about these things. You just need to remember to stay close to me."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng instructed seriously, and Gu Yang nodded, seemingly understanding.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they arrived at the Golden Bull Martial Arts Hall.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the familiar martial arts hall, Gu Qingfeng's brows furrowed slightly, as the more normal the scene appeared, the more it indicated something abnormal.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the doubts in his heart, Gu Qingfeng followed the disciple's lead and came to the main hall of the martial arts hall, where the group of disciples and Xu Jun had gathered a few days ago.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Qingfeng's arrival, Xu Jun enthusiastically stood up to greet him.</p><p></p><p>"Instructor Gu has come!"</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Pavilion Master. My son and I have come as agreed, but it seems that you all have no intention of leaving Linxian County?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng first returned the greeting with a cupped fist, then sat down and said with an unhappy expression.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, many of the disciples revealed strange expressions.</p><p></p><p>Only Xu Jun forced a smile and said helplessly, "Instructor Gu does not know, but just yesterday, people from the Exorcism Bureau came and ordered all the civilians to stay within the county and not leave. As for the demonic threat, they will be the ones to resolve it."</p><p></p><p>"The Exorcism Bureau?" Gu Qingfeng's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Without Gu Qingfeng asking, Xu Jun promptly answered, "Instructor Gu may not know, but the Exorcism Bureau is a mysterious institution of the court, whose main purpose is to deal with demonic threats in various places."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It is no small matter for anyone who can enter the Zhenxie Tribunal. Their strength is formidable.</p><p></p><p>Now that the people from the Zhenxie Tribunal have intervened, the demonic calamities in Linxian County will surely be resolved.</p><p></p><p>In that case, we don't need to take the risk of leaving Linxian County. We can just wait for the Zhenxie Tribunal to deal with the demonic calamities.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it is the Zhenxie Tribunal's order that no one is allowed to leave, and we dare not disobey it. Otherwise, we would incur the wrath of the powerful cultivators of the Zhenxie Tribunal, the consequences of which are unimaginable!</p><p></p><p>Xu Jun's words resonated with the other disciples, who nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Who would want to take risks when they can live safely? Since the Zhenxie Tribunal is the imperial court's agency for dealing with demonic calamities, they can just wait for the Zhenxie Tribunal to resolve the issue.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, leaving Linxian County would be tantamount to offending the Zhenxie Tribunal. It's best not to provoke an organization that is affiliated with the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jun's words helped Gu Qingfeng understand the current situation.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng didn't say much more and left with Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Cultivate well!" </p><p></p><p>After returning to their residence, Gu Qingfeng instructed Gu Yang and then went back to his own room, preparing to begin refining the Bloodline Pill in order to accelerate his breakthrough to the Bloodline Realm.</p><p></p><p>The arrival of the Zhenxie Tribunal had left Gu Qingfeng with a sense of unease. It wasn't that he didn't trust the Zhenxie Tribunal, but everything seemed too coincidental.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Jun had mentioned, Linxian County was a small and remote place, and news could hardly get out with the blood mist sealing the area. Yet the Zhenxie Tribunal had sent people there just a few days after the appearance of the blood mist - this was truly too coincidental.</p><p></p><p>Too coincidental! Often, such coincidences were not really coincidences.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Zhenxie Tribunal's order forbidding all the civilians from leaving Linxian County also made Gu Qingfeng feel that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>If it were just this one order, there wouldn't be much to worry about. But combined with the previous events, Gu Qingfeng understood that the situation was not as simple as Xu Jun had said.</p><p></p><p>The Zhenxie Tribunal's true intentions were rather intriguing.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng only pondered these thoughts in his heart and did not voice them out loud. Revealing one's deeper thoughts to those with only a superficial acquaintance was something to be wary of.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng had been a disciple at the Jinniu Martial Hall for years and was on casual terms with Xu Jun and the other disciples, he couldn't possibly tell them his suspicions. If the Zhenxie Tribunal indeed had ulterior motives, and someone relayed Gu Qingfeng's thoughts to them, he would be inviting trouble upon himself.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Qingfeng kept his thoughts to himself.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was certain of one thing - he could no longer stay in Linxian County.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Jinniu Martial Hall could not be relied upon. To leave Linxian County, he would have to depend on his own strength. After all, it all came down to one's cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>If he could break through to the Bloodline Realm or even higher, many problems would no longer be problems.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial thing right now was to break through the Bloodline Realm first. Although he was unsure of the Zhenxie Tribunal cultivators' exact strength, the fact that the perfected Xu Jun was so wary of them meant their power was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Gu Qingfeng cast aside his distracting thoughts and swallowed a Bloodline Pill, beginning to refine the power of the pill to forcefully advance to a higher realm.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

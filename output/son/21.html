        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng walked in from outside, respectfully bowed, and then said, "I report to the master of the house, an hour ago, the Supreme Elder of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, Cloud Changkong, descended upon White Stone City and personally went to the Qin family to demand an explanation."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this news,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression showed a hint of surprise: "Cloud Changkong... I remember he has always been in seclusion, hasn't he?"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Changkong, the Supreme Elder of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, was a high-level cultivator who had reached the Refine Blood realm. </p><p></p><p>He was the "Tide-Subduing Needle" of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, usually in seclusion to break through to the Refine Blood Perfection. This was no secret, so Gu Qingfeng was not unfamiliar with him.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had never met Cloud Changkong, he had heard of the other's reputation and deeds.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he has succeeded in his breakthrough during this time of seclusion?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng seemed to have thought of something.</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng nodded and said solemnly, "What the master has said is true. Cloud Changkong has indeed broken through to the Refine Blood Perfection. This time, he came with great momentum, even alarming the Patriarch of the Qin family.</p><p></p><p>The two sides discussed the matter in the Qin family, but the subordinate could not hear the specific details.</p><p></p><p>However, soon after Cloud Changkong entered the Qin family, a fierce battle broke out, and then Cloud Changkong left angrily, indicating that the two sides parted on bad terms."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of Cloud Changkong's visit to the Qin family was not difficult to guess - it must be related to the Scorching Sun Palm.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Qin family had ambushed the Heavenly Cloud Sect's people outside White Stone City. If Cloud Changkong had not broken through, it would have been fine, as he would have had to swallow his anger in the face of the Qin family's strength.</p><p></p><p>But now that Cloud Changkong had succeeded in his breakthrough, the situation was different.</p><p></p><p>As fellow cultivators who had reached the Refine Blood Perfection, who could say who was stronger?</p><p></p><p>Cloud Changkong came with great momentum, but it was clear that the Qin family did not give him a satisfactory answer. Now that the Heavenly Cloud Sect's Supreme Elder had left, it seemed the two sides had developed a grudge.</p><p></p><p>"After leaving the Qin family, Cloud Changkong should not have returned directly to the Heavenly Cloud Sect, right?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng asked again.</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng nodded, "The master's guess is correct. After leaving the Qin family, Cloud Changkong went directly to the Iron Bone Gang. This time, the two sides did not have any conflict, and the Iron Bone Gang even politely invited Cloud Changkong in."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled slightly, then said to Meng Peng.</p><p></p><p>"You continue to keep an eye on the movements of the Iron Bone Gang and the Qin family. As for the rest, you don't need to worry about it too much. If White Stone Road is in chaos, that is the business of White Stone Road.</p><p></p><p>With me here, the Gu family will not be in trouble."</p><p></p><p>"The master's cultivation has already reached the Transformation Realm. With you guarding us, the Gu family will certainly have no problems!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng said with admiration and awe.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's strength and his astonishing achievements were vivid in Meng Peng's mind.</p><p></p><p>In Meng Peng's eyes, Gu Qingfeng's strength was at least among the top three in White Stone Road. Even if he were to be compared to the Patriarch of the Qin family and the Patriarch of the Iron Bone Gang, he would not be inferior by much.</p><p></p><p>With such a powerful master guarding the Gu family, even if the White Stone Road was thrown into chaos, there would be no problem.</p><p></p><p>After sending Meng Peng away, Gu Qingfeng continued to cultivate the Scorching Sun Palm.</p><p></p><p>For him, nothing was more important than breaking through his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Meng Peng brought more news.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that Cloud Changkong and the Iron Bone Gang had a pleasant discussion, and the Patriarch of the Iron Bone Gang, Luo Yu, personally saw Cloud Changkong off from White Stone City.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, Gu Qingfeng was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>From the moment the Iron Bone Gang treated Cloud Changkong politely, he had already guessed their intentions.</p><p></p><p>In the past, White Stone Road was stable because there were only...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Two cultivators who had reached the peak of Blood Refining.</p><p></p><p>One was from the Iron Bone Gang.</p><p></p><p>The other was from the Qin Family.</p><p></p><p>These two powerful Blood Refining experts maintained the balance in the White Stone Dao, keeping the entire region in a delicate equilibrium. This balance prevented the White Stone Dao from descending into complete chaos, but it also prevented it from experiencing any major upheavals.</p><p></p><p>However, now a third expert who had reached the peak of Blood Refining has appeared, naturally causing the original balance of the White Stone Dao to undergo subtle changes.</p><p></p><p>This change...</p><p></p><p>Could potentially plunge the entire White Stone Dao into a bloody storm.</p><p></p><p>However, </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng paid little attention to these matters.</p><p></p><p>He had Meng Peng keep an eye on the movements of Yun Changkong and the Iron Bone Gang, just to have a grasp of the situation, but he had no intention of interfering.</p><p></p><p>For Gu Qingfeng, even if the White Stone Dao was thrown into complete turmoil, as long as it did not affect him, he could not be bothered to get involved.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>One month later.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng successfully entered the first layer of the Scorching Sun Divine Palm.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation difficulty of this mid-grade supreme martial art was even higher than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Even with Gu Qingfeng's Blood Refining cultivation, it took him a full month to reach the entry level of the first layer of the Scorching Sun Divine Palm.</p><p></p><p>"If it had been my earlier self, it would have taken at least ten or eight years to reach the entry level of the first layer of the Scorching Sun Divine Palm!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head inwardly.</p><p></p><p>His natural talent for martial arts could only be described as mediocre.</p><p></p><p>The more profound the martial art, the greater the cultivation difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, </p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the Scorching Sun Divine Palm required the accompaniment of corresponding medicinal baths, each of which cost hundreds of taels of silver. It was only because Gu Qingfeng's family was wealthy and powerful that he could afford such consumption.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary people, even if they obtained the Scorching Sun Divine Palm, it would be difficult for them to successfully cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>After entering the first layer of the Scorching Sun Divine Palm, Gu Qingfeng felt that his entire qi and blood seemed to have undergone subtle changes, as if they had acquired a faint scorching aura.</p><p></p><p>Although this scorching aura was extremely weak, almost imperceptible.</p><p></p><p>But this change was real and tangible.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was also amazed by the profundity of the top-tier mid-grade martial art.</p><p></p><p>Just the effects of entering the first layer were comparable to the small or even great accomplishments of other low-grade martial arts.</p><p></p><p>After realizing the benefits of the Scorching Sun Divine Palm, Gu Qingfeng's cultivation became increasingly frenzied.</p><p></p><p>In three months' time,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng cultivated the first layer of the Scorching Sun Divine Palm to perfection.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>He began to cultivate the second layer of the Scorching Sun Divine Palm.</p><p></p><p>As Gu Qingfeng's strength steadily increased, the White Stone Dao also underwent tremendous changes in these few months.</p><p></p><p>First,</p><p></p><p>The Iron Bone Gang took the initiative to make a move, breaking the long-standing peace of the White Stone Dao and attacking the other hegemon-level power, the Qin Family.</p><p></p><p>Over the course of several months, the two sides engaged in no less than dozens of conflicts, each of which resulted in considerable casualties, whether for the Iron Bone Gang or the Qin Family.</p><p></p><p>As the two major powers tore off their masks, the other powers that were affiliated with them were also passively dragged into this war.</p><p></p><p>In this way,</p><p></p><p>The entire White Stone Dao fell into complete chaos.</p><p></p><p>The only powers that could maintain neutrality were a few, such as the Gu Family, which had Blood Refining experts to guard them.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

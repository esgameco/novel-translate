        <h1>Chapter 88</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The murderous intent is unextinguished!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the true essence of a Grandmaster-level cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems this person is not an ordinary minor sect master, but rather an existence comparable to a Half-Step Grandmaster!"</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Lie's expression was also unusually grave.</p><p></p><p>A minor sect master and a Half-Step Grandmaster, while both involving the word "Grandmaster", the former is completely incomparable to the latter.</p><p></p><p>Half-Step Grandmaster!</p><p></p><p>Only the strongest who have truly grasped the essence of a Grandmaster can be worthy of the title of Half-Step Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>The combat prowess of such a level of expert is heaven-defying, and even if they are on par with an ordinary Grandmaster, they may not necessarily be much weaker.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ouyang Lie's words, the others also changed expression.</p><p></p><p>"Does the Sect Master mean to say that person has already mastered the true essence of a Grandmaster?"</p><p></p><p>"A Half-Step Grandmaster... Guangyang Prefecture hasn't had such a powerful expert in many years!"</p><p></p><p>"If this existence were to break through to become a Grandmaster, they might be able to instantly attain the realm of a True Essence Grandmasterâ€”"</p><p></p><p>Even Ancient Heart and Zhu Ming, the Sect Leaders of the other factions, had expressions of shock on their faces now.</p><p></p><p>Grandmaster!</p><p></p><p>There are distinctions within that title.</p><p></p><p>If a Grandmaster has not grasped the true essence, they can only be considered an ordinary Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>But even an ordinary Grandmaster can only be contended with by the top-tier Spirit Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>If a Grandmaster has grasped the true essence, they can be called a True Essence Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>A True Essence Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>They are above and beyond the ordinary Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Such an existence.</p><p></p><p>Can only be dealt with by Spirit Cultivators above the Spirit Sovereign Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, the path to grasping the true essence is arduous, and to elevate that true essence to the Grandmaster level is even more difficult.</p><p></p><p>But now that Gu Qingfeng has already grasped the Grandmaster's true essence, if he were to advance to become a true Grandmaster, he could directly attain the realm of a True Essence Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention Guangyang Prefecture, even in the entire Taishan Commandery, the number of experts who have reached the Grandmaster realm can be counted on one's fingers, let alone True Essence Grandmasters, who are as rare as phoenix feathers and qilin horns.</p><p></p><p>"This person cannot be allowed to remain, or else if he were to advance to become a True Essence Grandmaster, my Crimson Flame Sect will face great troubles!"</p><p></p><p>Ancient Heart's face was filled with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't paid much attention to the death of Wen Jiao, but now that he has learned of Gu Qingfeng's strength, Ancient Heart's heart is also filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>If they cannot eliminate him in advance.</p><p></p><p>If he were to break through to become a Grandmaster, the Crimson Flame Sect would have no chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Lie stood up, the scars on his palm had already disappeared, and his expression had also returned to its usual indifference.</p><p></p><p>"To slay a Half-Step Grandmaster, my Crimson Flame Sect must pay an enormous price, for even if I were to take action now, I do not have the full confidence to completely eliminate this person.</p><p></p><p>And if we were to band together to attack, how many of you present would have to sacrifice yourselves?"</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Lie's words made Ancient Heart's expression stiffen, and the others also unconsciously grew solemn.</p><p></p><p>Just as he said, to slay a Half-Step Grandmaster would require a tremendous price.</p><p></p><p>"The Taixuan Dynasty is already in decline, and the various powers are rising, if the Crimson Flame Sect were to suffer heavy losses at this time, we might soon face the blades of other sects and families.</p><p></p><p>So, this matter must be carefully considered!"</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Lie paused for a moment before continuing.</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, the issue of Wen Jiao will be set aside for now, as this is not the time to fight to the death with a Half-Step Grandmaster."</p><p></p><p>"As for him advancing further to become a True Essence Grandmaster, that is not something that can be accomplished in a short time, for refining the Five Impurities Realm is extremely difficult, and I'm sure you all understand that well."</p><p></p><p>"Without refining the Five Impurities Realm, how can he have the qualifications to assault the Grandmaster realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, there are so many talented martial artists in the world, all of whom have spent decades or even longer to reach their current level."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A hundred years of time would be needed to make another breakthrough on the Refining Impurity Realm. As long as this person does not become a Sect Master, he ultimately poses no great threat to my Crimson Flame Sect. "And by the time he achieves the level of a Sect Master, perhaps my Crimson Flame Sect would have already produced a top-tier Spiritual Sovereign, or even an existence beyond the Spiritual Sovereign realm!"</p><p></p><p>The words fell.</p><p></p><p>The main hall suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Everyone understood Ouyang Lie's intentions.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhu Ming took a deep breath and nodded: "The Sect Master's words are not false. In the current chaotic world, this is the time for us to rise."</p><p></p><p>"The last time the supreme power of the world changed and the previous dynasty fell, many ancient aristocratic families took advantage of the chaos to rise up and advance further."</p><p></p><p>"Now it is the end of another dynasty, the transition of the world. Our Crimson Flame Sect can also seize this opportunity to establish ourselves as an immortal ancient sect!"</p><p></p><p>The previous dynasty had ruled the world for three thousand six hundred years.</p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Dynasty has also lasted for about three thousand years.</p><p></p><p>For a dynasty, three thousand years or so is a cycle. From ancient times to the present, there are few dynasties that have lasted more than four thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, waiting for a chaotic era to arrive is not easy at all.</p><p></p><p>Even though the lifespan of cultivators is long, ordinary cultivators have not yet reached true immortality.</p><p></p><p>Three thousand years of time is enough for many cultivators to return to dust.</p><p></p><p>Even Spiritual Sovereigns only have a lifespan of about eight hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Only by breaking through the Spiritual Sovereign realm and achieving an even higher level of existence can one have a lifespan of more than a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>But for sects and aristocratic families to advance further during the transition of dynasties is not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when Zhu Ming's words fell, many people in their hearts already had ideas.</p><p></p><p>The remaining Elders of the Crimson Flame Peak, although unwilling in their hearts, were now helpless.</p><p></p><p>Outside the ancient city, the army was stationed, and between the army and the city, the ground was littered with corpses, and there were bloodstains that had not yet dried on the city walls, indicating that a fierce battle had taken place here not long ago.</p><p></p><p>In the main camp of the Divine Martial Army.</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing looked at the secret letter in his hand, his gaze slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Half-step Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>"He has hidden himself quite deeply!"</p><p></p><p>The secret letter in his hand contained intelligence about Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Pei Jing had almost forgotten about Gu Qingfeng's existence, after all, the previous Gu family was just a small family founded by a Blood Refining Warrior, not worth mentioning at all.</p><p></p><p>The previous recruitment attempt by the Black Mysterious Guard had failed, and one Centurion had fallen there. Pei Jing was somewhat angry, but didn't pay too much attention.</p><p></p><p>He just planned to wait until he conquered Guangyang Prefecture in the future, and then wipe out the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, in just a short period of time, the originally insignificant Blood Refining ant had now achieved the level of a Half-step Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng, the Tyrannical Saber! Even Pei Jing, upon learning this news, couldn't help but be surprised.</p><p></p><p>The concept of a Half-step Sect Master is something Pei Jing understands very well, because he himself is an innate Sect Master, but has not yet reached the level of comprehending the true meaning of being a Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>It is because the comprehension of the true meaning of being a Sect Master is extremely difficult, even with Pei Jing's talent, it is not easy for him to take that step.</p><p></p><p>Yet, there is now someone who has not yet reached the level of a Sect Master, but has already cultivated the true meaning of being a Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Such a person, it would be difficult not to pay attention to.</p><p></p><p>"If this person can be used by me, he will be of great help!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Passing of the Seasons</p><p></p><p>Time has flown by, and three more years have passed.</p><p></p><p>In these three years, the situation in the Baishi Dao has become increasingly chaotic and dire. Even the Gu family, where Gu Qingfeng resides, has had many of its businesses impacted.</p><p></p><p>Even some Lianxue Boundary powers have attempted to seize the opportunity to annex the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>However, a year and a half ago, Gu Qingfeng personally intervened, decisively crushing and killing a renowned Lianxue Boundary cultivator in broad daylight. This instantly shook the Baishi Dao.</p><p></p><p>Until this moment, others had only just realized the truth.</p><p></p><p>The low-key Gu family patriarch, who had never shown his hand, was actually a powerful expert at the Lianxue Boundary.</p><p></p><p>Judging from his ability to subdue a peer-level cultivator, he was at least a mid-Lianxue Boundary, and might have even reached the higher Lianxue Boundary.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the Gu family has suddenly risen to become a renowned and formidable clan in the Baishi Dao.</p><p></p><p>Many powers have since come to visit, hoping to establish connections with the Gu family. After all, with the chaotic situation in the Baishi Dao and the turmoil outside, aligning with a powerful clan is not necessarily a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng has no intention of meddling in jianghu affairs, politely declining the overtures of these many powers. </p><p></p><p>Even so, the Gu family's reputation in the Baishi Dao has become resoundingly renowned.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Gu family's rear garden, Gu Qingfeng was cultivating the Scorching Sun Divine Palm. As his palm techniques unfolded, the surging blood energy and power were like raging flames, erupting with terrifying, scorching intensity.</p><p></p><p>Midway through the technique, Gu Qingfeng's body suddenly trembled, and the previously simmering blood energy spiked dramatically, causing the temperature in the garden to rise sharply.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A palm strike landed, reducing the rocks to powder.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng halted his movements, the boiling blood energy gradually subsiding. He then glanced at his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng  Age: 35/100  Cultivation: Mid-Lianxue Boundary  Martial Arts: Gu Family Fist (Unbreakable Level 1), Iron Body Technique (Iron Body Level 1), Great Slab-Smashing Palm (Mastery), Iron Leg Technique (Mastery), Forged Iron Finger (Mastery), Scorching Sun Divine Palm (Entered 4th Layer)  Upgrade Points: 0</p><p></p><p>"I've finally entered the 4th Layer of the Scorching Sun Divine Palm!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was one of satisfaction. After three years of arduous cultivation, he had perfected the first three layers of the Scorching Sun Divine Palm. Just now, he had experienced a sudden enlightenment, allowing him to break through the limits of the 3rd Layer and enter the 4th Layer.</p><p></p><p>Although the transition from the 3rd Layer perfection to the 4th Layer entry was just a single step, Gu Qingfeng could clearly feel his strength increasing significantly with this breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a woman in a blue dress, with fair skin and a beautiful countenance, approached. Seeing the sweat on Gu Qingfeng's brow and the powdered rocks, she had a hint of a smile in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, my lord, on your cultivation breakthrough!"</p><p></p><p>"My lady has arrived," Gu Qingfeng said with a calm smile. When he noticed the slight swell of her belly, a tender look flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This woman was named Xu Yulan, the legitimate daughter of the Xu family in the Baishi Dao. A year ago, the Xu family had suffered a great calamity, and she had fled to the Gu family, with Gu Qingfeng rescuing her.</p><p></p><p>Since then, Xu Yulan had been living in the Gu family. </p><p></p><p>In less than two months, Gu Qingfeng had married her.</p><p></p><p>The reason Gu Qingfeng married Xu Yulan was not only because he felt a connection with her, but also...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He wanted to have a few more offspring to take a look. Not bad.</p><p></p><p>It's just about having offspring.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he awakened his golden finger, Gu Qingfeng only had Gu Yang as his offspring. Whenever the other party broke through, he could get corresponding benefits.</p><p></p><p>But the further the warriors go, the more difficult the breakthroughs become.</p><p></p><p>Like the current situation.</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Yang's breakthrough in the Refine Skin realm, three years have passed without him being able to break through to the Refine Skin Perfection realm.</p><p></p><p>Even the Refine Skin realm is like this.</p><p></p><p>When it comes to entering the Refine Blood realm in the future, the required time will only increase.</p><p></p><p>Even though the lifespan of Refine Blood realm cultivators is higher than ordinary people, it is still limited. Perhaps one day, Gu Qingfeng will reach the end of his lifespan and die of old age.</p><p></p><p>So, he must change his thinking.</p><p></p><p>Marry Xu Yulan.</p><p></p><p>This is a way for Gu Qingfeng to verify his golden finger.</p><p></p><p>He wants to see, after Xu Yulan's child is born, if he can pass on his martial arts cultivation to the child, and whether the child's breakthroughs can also bring him improvements.</p><p></p><p>If it really works, then Gu Qingfeng's next idea is to make some adjustments.</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Gu Qingfeng's mind, and he said to Xu Yulan, "The wind is strong today, my lady. You should rest well, lest you catch a cold and affect the child."</p><p></p><p>"I have been taking medicinal soups every day, and the child in my belly is very healthy. My lord can rest assured," Xu Yulan replied with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>In order to ensure that the child Xu Yulan was carrying would have the same talent as Gu Yang, Gu Qingfeng specifically sought out miraculous methods and then spared no expense to purchase many precious medicinal materials, which he had Xu Yulan take every day.</p><p></p><p>After a year.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the child in the belly, even Xu Yulan herself has benefited greatly. If it weren't for the child in her belly, she might have already broken through to the Refine Skin Intermediate realm.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that Xu Yulan's talent is not particularly strong. When she married Gu Qingfeng, she was already twenty years old, but she had just barely entered the Refine Skin Initial realm. Now, in less than a year, she is almost qualified to break through to the Refine Skin Intermediate realm, which shows how much effort Gu Qingfeng has put into this.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yulan's brows furrowed slightly, and a slight expression of pain appeared on her face.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Qingfeng's expression changed, and he hurriedly supported Xu Yulan. "My lady?"</p><p></p><p>"My lord, don't worry. Just now, the child in my belly kicked me, but it's nothing serious," Xu Yulan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Qingfeng finally felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he accompanied Xu Yulan back to the bedroom, let her rest well, and then summoned a doctor to examine her.</p><p></p><p>After half a day passed, Gu Qingfeng walked out of the bedroom with the doctor.</p><p></p><p>"Doctor Liu, how is the condition of my wife?"</p><p></p><p>"Master Gu can rest assured. Your wife's body is healthy, and the child in her belly is also very healthy. It is estimated that in two months, she will be able to give birth," Doctor Liu said with a chuckle.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Qingfeng was overjoyed, and then he called someone. "You will see Doctor Liu off!"</p><p></p><p>Then, Gu Qingfeng took out a silver note from his bosom and handed it to Doctor Liu as a reward for his hard work. Seeing the amount on the silver note, Doctor Liu's face immediately broke into a wide smile.</p><p></p><p>After Doctor Liu left, Gu Qingfeng looked back at the bedroom and then summoned two maids.</p><p></p><p>"You must take good care of my lady. Do not let anything go wrong, or I will hold you responsible!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" the maids replied.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 98</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng asked.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said, "The person who came is from the Exorcism Department of Guangyang Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"If more people come later, just tell them I'm in seclusion. There's no need to get involved in the affairs of the Nine Bend Path for now, let those ancestral sects and the Exorcism Department take the lead first.</p><p></p><p>The ancestral sects that have existed for a thousand years must have their own foundations.</p><p></p><p>And with the Exorcism Department's formidable strength, dealing with a demonic entity should not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Now they are inviting various forces to go to the Nine Bend Path to suppress the demonic entity, but it's probably just looking for cannon fodder..."</p><p></p><p>Given the foundations of those ancestral sects and the strength of the Exorcism Department, Gu Qingfeng did not believe they could not even handle the demonic entity at the Nine Bend Path.</p><p></p><p>Even if we look at it from another angle.</p><p></p><p>If these people really cannot deal with the demonic entity at the Nine Bend Path, then he would most likely end up as a sacrifice as well.</p><p></p><p>So, </p><p></p><p>from any perspective,</p><p></p><p>there is no need for him to get involved in the affairs at the Nine Bend Path this time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang heard this and nodded, "I understand, father!"</p><p></p><p>Subsequently,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said again, "In the next few days, I will be leaving the Gu Family Manor for a while, you will stay in the manor and preside over the affairs."</p><p></p><p>"Father is planning to go to the Nine Bend Path?" </p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled faintly, "Although the Gu Family Manor does not need to participate in this battle, it would still be good to take a look at that demonic entity."</p><p></p><p>In this battle,</p><p></p><p>he just wants to take a look at the foundations of the various ancestral sects, to see how much gap there is between the Gu Family Manor and them.</p><p></p><p>Or rather,</p><p></p><p>to gain a better understanding of the strength of that demonic entity.</p><p></p><p>If the major ancestral sects really end up in failure,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng himself also needs to be prepared.</p><p></p><p>After all -</p><p></p><p>Although the White Stone Path is somewhat distant from the Nine Bend Path, the two are still within Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>If the Nine Bend Path really falls, it would be unlikely for the White Stone Path to remain stable as well.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>knowing oneself and knowing the enemy, one can be unharmed in a hundred battles.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>On the ancient path,</p><p></p><p>there was a figure in blue robes walking leisurely.</p><p></p><p>But if there were bystanders, they would find that although the person's steps seemed slow, they would disappear from sight in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The person was none other than Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>He did not ride a swift horse, because at his level of martial arts, ordinary footsteps were far stronger than a fast horse.</p><p></p><p>Walking a thousand li in a day,</p><p></p><p>and eight hundred li at night,</p><p></p><p>were all trivial matters to him.</p><p></p><p>This was Gu Qingfeng's second time leaving the White Stone Path in many years, the first time was to destroy the Azure Yang Sect, and now the second time was to go to the Nine Bend Path.</p><p></p><p>On the way, Gu Qingfeng also witnessed the chaos in this world.</p><p></p><p>Mountain bandits were rampant.</p><p></p><p>Rogue armies were like thieves.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally he would see imperial soldiers committing acts of banditry, looting the common people, as well as robbing and killing passing civilians and merchants.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p></p><p>whenever Gu Qingfeng encountered such situations, he would casually resolve them.</p><p></p><p>He did not have the ability to directly change the decaying order of this world, but if he encountered injustice, resolving it was not a problem.</p><p></p><p>As for righteousness,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not consider himself a righteous person.</p><p></p><p>But,</p><p></p><p>as a martial artist, the principle is to act upon one's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>If he sees something he dislikes, he will take action, without much to be said.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>on the journey here,</p><p></p><p>the Demon-Slaying Saber has also tasted much blood.</p><p></p><p>The more blood this divine weapon has tasted, the more Gu Qingfeng discovered that it was undergoing subtle changes, or rather, even before the cultivation of the Saber-Taming Art began, the Demon-Slaying Saber was already slowly transforming.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Godly Sword has now drunk blood, hastening the pace of this transformation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Stepping into the Nine Curve Path.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng immediately felt a cold, invisible aura permeating the air, and the Demon-Slaying Sword on his back trembled slightly, as if sensing something.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Qingfeng's expression involuntarily turned grave.</p><p></p><p>"The evil aura here is so severe, it seems the evil in the Nine Curve Path is indeed not simple!"</p><p></p><p>Only when the evil is powerful enough, can the force inherent to the evil itself dissipate outwards, causing one to sense the presence of evil even without seeing any traces of it.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had already guessed the strength of the evil in the Nine Curve Path before.</p><p></p><p>But now, he was even more certain.</p><p></p><p>However, just as Gu Qingfeng was about to delve deeper into the Nine Curve Path, suddenly, the Demon-Slaying Sword on his back violently shook, as if emitting a sword cry, and immediately a sense of ominous crisis surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"This is not right!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression changed, and his body abruptly retreated.</p><p></p><p>In that moment he retreated, the scene in front of him suddenly changed, the trees twisting and dissipating, and an ancient city appeared in his line of sight.</p><p></p><p>Above the ancient city, a Buddha sat in the void, plucking a flower and smiling, tears of blood flowing from his eyes, his gaze meeting Gu Qingfeng's.</p><p></p><p>And around the Buddha, there were blooming lotus flowers, but upon closer inspection, the figures seated within the golden lotuses had their bodies pierced, the wounds extending from their anuses to the tops of their skulls, their skin completely flayed off, with copious amounts of blood spilling, turning the lotuses into eerie blood lotuses.</p><p></p><p>"Save... save me!!" </p><p></p><p>Someone struggled to speak, their voice hoarse and filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>Some tried to raise their hands to struggle, but their bodies were already impaled, leaving them utterly powerless to break free.</p><p></p><p>This scene caused Gu Qingfeng's pupils to constrict.</p><p></p><p>Among the many figures on the blood lotuses, he also saw a familiar face - Zhuo Feng from the Zhuo family.</p><p></p><p>But now, Zhuo Feng's entire skin had been stripped off, his muscles and veins exposed to the air, with a large amount of blood flowing from his body, his appearance utterly miserable.</p><p></p><p>If not for being able to vaguely recognize the features, Gu Qingfeng would have had difficulty identifying him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Qingfeng understood that the experts from the major sects and families had likely all been wiped out.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, someone could no longer endure the pain and let out a piercing, agonized scream, their body abruptly splitting apart, the evil they harbored also awakening at that moment.</p><p></p><p>However, just as the evil was reviving, the Buddha's massive hand in the void reached out and grabbed the evil, swallowing the body carrying the evil along with it, a large amount of blood flowing down the corners of its mouth.</p><p></p><p>Devouring the evil!</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Gu Qingfeng had witnessed an evil being destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the Buddha above the ancient city was an extremely powerful evil, and the evil harbored within the bodies of the experts from the major sects and families had now become the sustenance for this ancient city's evil.</p><p></p><p>And as each evil was consumed, Gu Qingfeng could clearly feel the aura of the ancient city's evil growing even stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Evil Buddha!"</p><p></p><p>"This is definitely a calamity-level evil!!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took a deep breath, barely managing to suppress the terror in his heart. The illusion he had just witnessed, as well as the events unfolding before him, were enough to prove that this was a calamity-level evil that had already condensed in the forbidden area.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

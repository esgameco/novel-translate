        <h1>Chapter 105</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was holding a long saber, the blade gleaming with a chilling, ruthless aura as he single-handedly fended off the attacks of several powerful rebel soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang did not pay much attention to the other Blood Refinement Perfected martial artists, as he could easily slay those at the Blood Refinement Realm with his current abilities.</p><p></p><p>What truly made Gu Yang wary was the middle-aged martial general before him, whose formidable strength had allowed him to cultivate a body with bronze-like bones, placing him at the Bone Refinement Intermediate Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Well, well, the young master of the Gu Family Manor, to have such strength at merely the Blood Refinement Realm, you might just become a formidable enemy if allowed to grow further!" </p><p></p><p>"I heard the King had sent people to the White Stone Path to recruit you from the Gu Family Manor, but unfortunately, you refused."</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, then you shall not be allowed to live!"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged martial general's expression turned ice-cold, his eyes brimming with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, since the Gu Family Manor had refused the invitation from the Martial King, they had become enemies. And now that Gu Yang had personally led his disciples to obstruct them, there was no room for retreat.</p><p></p><p>So, in that moment, the middle-aged martial general had decided that Gu Yang could not be allowed to live. As for offending the Gu Family Manor by slaying Gu Yang, he had no concerns about that.</p><p></p><p>Once this matter was done, the very existence of the Gu Family Manor would be questionable.</p><p></p><p>With this thought, the middle-aged martial general suddenly roared, "Fire the arrow!"</p><p></p><p>As the words left his mouth, a command arrow shot up into the dusky sky, its light blazing brightly.</p><p></p><p>"You're dead!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing his men release the arrow, the middle-aged martial general's face contorted with a savage expression.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang remained silent, but his heart was searching for a way to escape.</p><p></p><p>The White Stone Path belonged to the Gu Family Manor. The rebel soldiers' uprising was something Gu Yang could not tolerate.</p><p></p><p>So after learning of the rebellion, he had led his outer disciples to come, only to find that the entire Red Rock Village had already been massacred.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the two sides clashed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had initially intended to slay the rebel soldiers, but he did not expect there to be a Bone Refinement Intermediate Realm expert among them.</p><p></p><p>Now, the rebels were apparently gathering more reinforcements, and with the current situation, Gu Yang's side had little chance of victory.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Gu Yang felt the urge to retreat.</p><p></p><p>Although he considered his own strength formidable, if he were to be surrounded by the rebels, he would find it difficult to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Better to live to fight another day."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged martial general saw the hesitation in Gu Yang's heart and his expression turned savage, the murderous intent on his face unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>As the words left his mouth, the middle-aged martial artist's long saber descended, the chilling gleam and terrifying gale of its strike accompanied by the full-force attacks of the other Blood Refinement Perfected martial artists.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Gu Yang found it difficult to escape.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Gu Yang felt a powerful gust of wind approaching from behind. Instinctively, he swung his saber, only to have it strike a fist.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The saber, capable of splitting rocks, merely left a white mark on the fist, as if it had struck an impenetrable steel alloy. Yet, a terrifying force surged from the blade, causing Gu Yang's blood and qi to churn, and his body to retreat several steps involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>"Kill him!"</p><p></p><p>Seizing the opportunity, the middle-aged martial general broke through Gu Yang's blood and qi defenses, viciously slashing him with the long saber.</p><p></p><p>Squelch!</p><p></p><p>The saber sank into flesh.</p><p></p><p>Blood sprayed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's body was sent flying.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master!!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the Gu Family Village watched this scene unfold, their expressions drastically changing.</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's body was flung through the air, but just as he was about to hit the ground, he forcefully twisted his body to stabilize himself. After landing, he planted his long saber into the ground. Fierce blade wounds extended from his shoulder down across his chest, and one could even faintly see his beating heart.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately.</p><p></p><p>As a Refined Blood martial artist, his physical body was exceptionally robust. </p><p></p><p>An injury that would be fatal for a common person was merely a grievous wound for a Refined Blood martial artist.</p><p></p><p>The wound barely healed, stemming the flow of fresh blood. Gu Yang's complexion was pale from the substantial blood loss. It was at this moment that he finally saw who had struck him.</p><p></p><p>It turned out to be a burly middle-aged man, his skin cast in a bronze hue, his muscles knotted like they contained explosive power.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, for a small Refined Blood realm martial artist to block my Season Sect's punch. You can be proud of yourself!" </p><p></p><p>Season licked his lips, his gaze towards Gu Yang filled with mockery.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the name "Season", Gu Yang's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Fist Gold Demon, Season!"</p><p></p><p>The Divine Fist Gold Demon! </p><p></p><p>He was the Sect Master of the Divine Fist Sect of the Flowing Cloud Manor, a powerful jianghu expert who had reached the pinnacle of the Refine Bone realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang never expected such a formidable figure to appear here, and judging from his bearing, he had already allied himself with the Divine Martial King, Pei Jing, serving him.</p><p></p><p>Season smiled slightly: "It seems you've heard of my reputation. Unfortunately, you will die here today. A genius like you, if you don't die, your future accomplishments will be limitless. But you know, I most enjoy slaying geniuses!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, </p><p>Season slowly approached Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, Gu Yang was now just a lamb awaiting slaughter. Season was in no hurry to make his move.</p><p></p><p>Capturing his prey.</p><p>He most enjoyed feeling the fear emanating from his target.</p><p></p><p>However, </p><p>to Season's disappointment, Gu Yang's expression remained fearless from start to finish. Instead, his right hand gripped the saber hilt, as if preparing for a final, desperate struggle.</p><p></p><p>"Why bother struggling? Not only you, even if your father came, I would not fear him. That Tyrant Saber is nothing more than a coward hiding in the White Stone Path, a mere rat."</p><p></p><p>"How dare you insult my father!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's eyes burned with killing intent, his aura slowly building up. He was just waiting for Season to step into his attack range before striking.</p><p>In his current injured state, he could only unleash one more blow.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, insult him? If he dares show up here-"</p><p></p><p>Season's cold laughter was interrupted by a calm voice.</p><p></p><p>"And if I do show up here, what then?"</p><p></p><p>At these words, Season's face instantly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>A man in blue robes slowly approached, an oppressive aura permeating the air. The combatants who had been fighting earlier all involuntarily paused.</p><p>All eyes were on the newcomer.</p><p></p><p>"Father!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng glanced at his son's injuries, his gaze growing even colder.</p><p>Then, Gu Qingfeng looked back at Season, his face devoid of any emotion.</p><p></p><p>"Let me ask you again, what if I were to come here?"</p><p></p><p>"Gu...Gu Qingfeng!!"</p><p></p><p>Season's face turned deathly pale. When their eyes met, a sense of terror welled up within him.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that his casual remark would actually summon this man here.</p><p></p><p>A name can cast a long shadow.</p><p></p><p>A Half-Step Sect Master was an existence of such magnitude, and Season understood this well.</p><p></p><p>So, in an instant, </p><p>without saying another word, Season hastily retreated, then turned and fled.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 194</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The demonic evil howled, and an even more terrifying power burst forth from it, sweeping through the vast expanse of the sky like raging waves, capable of causing even the greatest martial arts masters to perish before it.</p><p></p><p>But when Gu Qingfeng faced this power, his expression remained fearless. His physical body and vital energy erupted, as the two great celestial veins were activated, and the profound cosmic forces descended upon him, instantly shattering the boundaries of his original realm.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the peak of the Extreme Dao Master realm!</p><p>Attaining the perfect mastery of the Extreme Dao Master realm!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In less than a breath, Gu Qingfeng had broken through the barrier of the Extreme Dao Master realm and ascended to an even higher level. </p><p></p><p>This level, he was not entirely sure how to name.</p><p></p><p>He unleashed a punch.</p><p></p><p>The surging, terrifying power tore through the sky.</p><p></p><p>The nine levels of the Sun and Moon Truths were pushed to their utmost limits by Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>He transformed his left hand into a fist, while his right hand became a sharp blade. The powers of the two great Truths manifested simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>On one side, the Sun and Moon swept across the heavens, annihilating mountains and rivers; on the other, the Sword Intent was fierce and unparalleled. The combined forces of these two Truths struck the demonic evil, causing it to retreat repeatedly, its flesh and blood shattering, its appearance utterly disheveled.</p><p></p><p>Suppression! </p><p>Complete suppression!</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Gu Qingfeng had exerted his full strength since breaking through the middle stage of the Extreme Dao Master realm. The powers of the two great celestial veins had propelled his cultivation to an inconceivable level.</p><p></p><p>The two great Truths reigned supreme, completely subduing the demonic evil.</p><p></p><p>The nearby Sword Dao cultivator was utterly astonished, not only by the eruption of Gu Qingfeng's vital energy and power, but also by the Truths he displayed.</p><p></p><p>He had always considered himself to be among the strongest in the world, with only a few who could match him. But in the face of Gu Qingfeng, he was still found lacking.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Rumble!!</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression remained cold and stern. As time passed, his mastery of the two Truths became more and more effortless, and they began to gradually fuse, as if a new Truth was about to be born.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, </p><p>the Sun and Moon dissipated.</p><p>The Sword Intent soared in the void.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying, blood-curdling power coalesced in the void, forming a supreme celestial sword that rent the heavens and earth, severing the stars and moons. The majestic divine might descended, and even the demonic evil's crimson eyes were filled with a sense of terror.</p><p></p><p>In the next instant,</p><p>the celestial sword descended.</p><p>The demonic evil's body exploded.</p><p></p><p>The blood mist scattered, and the white bones vanished. </p><p>All the eerie, icy aura disappeared without a trace, including the remnants of the golden coffin.</p><p></p><p>"Rumbleâ€”"</p><p>The celestial sword struck the earth.</p><p>Mountains and valleys were cleaved in two.</p><p></p><p>A natural-looking sword scar was deeply etched into the earth, like an abyss that struck fear into the heart.</p><p></p><p>And at the moment the demonic evil was vanquished, a severed finger suddenly appeared. The finger possessed a remarkable aura, and when Gu Qingfeng looked at it, his expression shifted slightly. He promptly took out a jade bottle containing medicinal pills, which could perfectly accommodate the severed finger.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng checked his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng  Age: 43/3000  Realm: Middle Stage of the Extreme Dao Master</p><p></p><p>Martial Arts:</p><p>- Heaven Thunder Sword Technique (Introductory)</p><p>- Five Viscera Classic (Fifth Layer, Five Viscera like Gods Level 5)</p><p>- Primordial Treasure Mirror (Fifth Layer, Refining Viscera like Iron Level 5)</p><p>- Scarlet Flame Divine Skill (Ninth Layer Perfected, Scarlet Flame Palm Technique Level 8)</p><p>- Prajna Sutra (Thirteenth Layer Perfected, Prajna True Body Level 12)</p><p>- Celestial Vein Classic (Second Layer)</p><p>- Longevity Technique (Perfected, Longevity Level 4)</p><p>- Pure Yang True Body (Introductory, Flesh Body Pure Yang Level 1)</p><p>- Celestial Sword (Introductory, Celestial Sword Truth Level 10)</p><p></p><p>Upgrade Points: 46</p><p></p><p>"Celestial Sword!"</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng saw the Celestial Sword appear, his gaze flickered.</p><p></p><p>This was the martial art he had formed by fusing the Tyrannical Sword Technique and the Sun and Moon Fist Classic.</p><p></p><p>Celestial Sword!</p><p>Truth Level 10!</p><p></p><p>The limit for a Martial Arts Master's Truth was Level 9, but Level 10 Truth signified the realm of a true Great Martial Arts Master.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Qingfeng were to be considered a Great Martial Arts Master, then his mastery of the Level 10 Celestial Sword Truth would make him a Great Truth Master.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Gu Qingfeng noticed that all the other Truths he had previously cultivated had disappeared, with only the Celestial Sword Truth remaining.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that those Truths had all been transformed into the nourishment for the Celestial Sword.</p><p></p><p>With the fusion of this martial art, the Celestial Sword had become Gu Qingfeng's first Great Master-level martial art.</p><p></p><p>Yes! </p><p>It was a Great Master-level martial art! The moment the Celestial Sword Truth reached Level 10, it could be considered a true Great Master-level technique.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Sword Dao cultivator emerged from his state of shock, looking at the vanished demonic evil with a changed expression.</p><p></p><p>"The demonic evil has been slain!?"</p><p></p><p>It was a widely accepted fact that the demonic evil could not be killed.</p><p></p><p>But now,</p><p>not only had the demonic evil of Blood Mountain been defeated, but it had been completely annihilated, leaving no trace behind.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, the Sword Dao cultivator looked at Gu Qingfeng with a reverent expression and cupped his hands, saying, "Sword Dao cultivator greets the Martial Saint!"</p><p></p><p>He had now realized Gu Qingfeng's true identity.</p><p>Among all the cultivators in the Nine Realms, only the Martial Saint could have reached such a terrifying level of power.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Originally, when the Sword Dao Cultivator first saw Gu Qingfeng, he had not yet thought in that direction.</p><p></p><p>But after truly seeing Gu Qingfeng's hand techniques, he already had some thoughts in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Now, his thoughts have become even more firm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the Sword Dao Cultivator with a calm expression: "The reputation of the Iron Sword Sect is something Gu has long heard of. Now that the world is in chaos, with evil cultivators causing havoc, the King of Guangyang wishes to purge the world and restore the heavens and earth. I wonder if the Iron Sword Sect would be willing to serve the King of Guangyang?"</p><p></p><p>He directly made the recruitment offer.</p><p></p><p>If it were an ordinary person, Gu Qingfeng would not have bothered to make this overture.</p><p></p><p>But, the Sword Dao Cultivator before him was somewhat different.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that the other party dared to enter the Blood Mountain Mansion alone and suppress the evil cultivator, even with the opponent's cultivation at the half-step Grand Ancestor level, as well as that sword technique that could rival true Grand Ancestor experts, were enough for Gu Qingfeng to value him.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful expert is rare in the world.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang needs to contend for the world and stabilize the Nine Provinces. He must have sufficient strength to support this.</p><p></p><p>Although the Divine Martial Sect has already submitted and joined, and many jianghu martial artists have joined their ranks, in Gu Qingfeng's view, this force is still somewhat insufficient.</p><p></p><p>If the Sword Dao Cultivator could lead the Iron Sword Sect to join Gu Yang's camp, then it would be a beneficial arrangement.</p><p></p><p>These words made the Sword Dao Cultivator also stunned.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, he did not expect Gu Qingfeng to make such a direct recruitment offer to him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Sword Dao Cultivator's silence, Gu Qingfeng spoke again: "Sir, you have reached the half-step Grand Ancestor level, but your aura is decaying, and your lifespan is likely limited. If you are willing to lead the Iron Sword Sect to join the King of Guangyang's camp, I can bestow upon you the Longevity Technique!"</p><p></p><p>"Longevity Technique!!" The Sword Dao Cultivator's expression changed, and he then said in a deep voice, "According to what old master knows, the Longevity Techniques in the world are nothing more than cultivating evil into the body. If the Longevity Technique you speak of is such a method, then please do not bother!"</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating evil into the body is only a minor path, how can it be called the complete Great Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng let out a wry smile, and then pointed out, instantly a surge of mighty true intent entered the Sword Dao Cultivator's mind, revealing the profound mysteries of the Longevity Technique.</p><p></p><p>True intent pouring in.</p><p></p><p>This was a direction that Gu Qingfeng naturally grasped after breaking through the tenth level of true intent.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>An hour later, the Sword Dao Cultivator finally emerged from that true intent, and when he looked at Gu Qingfeng again, his eyes were filled with astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"The Longevity Technique!"</p><p>"The Perfect Martial Dao!"</p><p>"I see... I see!!"</p><p></p><p>The excited expression on the Sword Dao Cultivator's face was difficult to suppress.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Longevity Technique allowed the bottleneck that had troubled him for hundreds of years to loosen a bit.</p><p></p><p>Although the Longevity Technique has only reached the Marrow-Cleansing Realm for now, the profundity of such a Perfect Martial Dao made the Sword Dao Cultivator feel as if his mind had been enlightened.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he truly understood what the Perfect Martial Dao was.</p><p></p><p>The path he had walked before was incomplete and flawed. Now that the Perfect Martial Dao had appeared, the Sword Dao Cultivator gained true enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the Sword Dao Cultivator bowed deeply to Gu Qingfeng, no longer maintaining the attitude of a senior, but completely performing the etiquette of a junior.</p><p></p><p>"I am deeply grateful to the senior for bestowing this technique, allowing me to glimpse the true Perfect Martial Dao. This fortuitous encounter is akin to being reborn, and I will never forget it.</p><p></p><p>From today onwards, I can make the decision myself, and the Iron Sword Sect will serve the King of Guangyang. Whatever the senior commands, I will obey!"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Cultivator was well aware of the importance of this level of martial art. In the current chaotic world, various sects are stingy with their knowledge, let alone something as extraordinary as the Longevity Technique.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Cultivator was certain that after a period of closed-door cultivation with the Longevity Technique, breaking through to the Grand Ancestor realm would be a done deal.</p><p></p><p>Once he reached the Grand Ancestor realm, he could extend his lifespan by three hundred years.</p><p></p><p>However, this was not the most important thing.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing was the Longevity Technique itself.</p><p></p><p>As Gu Qingfeng said, this was a Longevity Technique. From Perfect Skin Refinement to Perfect Marrow Cleansing, if he could cultivate the entire technique, he could add a thousand years to his lifespan.</p><p></p><p>With the Sword Dao Cultivator's vision, he naturally understood the immense significance of an extra thousand years of lifespan.</p><p></p><p>The reason why evil cultivators are revered in the current world is ultimately because they can live much longer.</p><p></p><p>Faced with life and death, many are willing to sacrifice everything, even if it means losing their original heart by cultivating evil.</p><p></p><p>If the Longevity Technique were to spread, it would undoubtedly shatter the existing jianghu order, and that would be the moment for the true revival of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Sword Dao Cultivator also understood why Gu Qingfeng was called the Martial Saint.</p><p></p><p>Leaving aside other aspects, the Longevity Technique alone that Gu Qingfeng created could be worthy of the title of Martial Saint.</p><p></p><p>With the Martial Ancestor of the past who pacified the world, and the Martial Saint who revived the Martial Dao, the Sword Dao Cultivator felt as if he had already seen the scene of the declining Martial Dao being revived.</p><p></p><p>"If you break through to the Grand Ancestor realm in the future, you can also come to the Gu Family Manor," Gu Qingfeng said, and then his figure disappeared from the original spot.

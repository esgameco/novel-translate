        <h1>Chapter 156</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the center of Guangyang Prefecture, the news reached Gu Yang first.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had left the manor.</p><p></p><p>The heavy stone that had been weighing on his heart dropped.</p><p></p><p>Since his father had left the manor, it meant that he was confident in dealing with the Tianyang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Gu Yang had also inquired about the strange forces that had recently emerged in Qingyun State, finding out where they came from.</p><p></p><p>The Shen Sword Sect - from Jianzhou! The Taisuzu Sect - from Lingzhou! The Ji Family - from Xianzhou! These were all powerful immortal sects and families, on par with the Tianyang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Not only had the three great immortal powers sent experts, but many other top sects and families had also sent powerful figures to Qingyun State.</p><p></p><p>Their target was obvious - it was Gu Yang, the King of Guangyang, and the great master behind him.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Yang's eyes, this battle was of utmost importance.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Qingfeng and the Tianyang Sword Sect ended up in a stalemate, the other forces might seize the opportunity to make their move.</p><p></p><p>In that case, the only outcome would be victory, and it must be a resounding one! Otherwise, it would not be enough to intimidate these immortal sects and families.</p><p></p><p>"Where is my father now?" Gu Yang asked the hidden guard before him.</p><p></p><p>The hidden guard respectfully replied, "Your Majesty, ever since your esteemed father left the Gu Family Manor, his whereabouts have been untraceable. Even our hidden guards monitoring the route could not detect any clues."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang's expression was resigned, but he did not get angry.</p><p></p><p>After all, while the hidden guards' intelligence capabilities were formidable, it was impossible for them to constantly keep an eye on a great master.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the hidden guards were cultivated by Gu Qingfeng himself. If he did not want them to find his whereabouts, it would be effortless for him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Yi entered from outside.</p><p></p><p>"I pay my respects to Your Majesty!" he said.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?" Gu Yang asked calmly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi reported, "The hidden guards have informed us that there are many strange experts in the prefecture city, likely from the other prefectures of Qingyun State, as well as forces from outside Qingyun State. Their arrival has greatly impacted the stability of the prefecture. I await Your Majesty's decision."</p><p></p><p>Hearing about the strange experts, Gu Yang's expression momentarily faltered, but he quickly regained his composure.</p><p></p><p>"These forces have come for my father and the Tianyang Sword Sect. As long as they don't cause trouble, we don't need to pay them any mind. However, in the coming period, the hidden guards must strictly monitor the situation in the prefecture city. If anyone dares to cause a disturbance, suppress them immediately."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's tone had become increasingly cold. The Guangyang Prefecture was his domain, and no other forces would be allowed to run amok.</p><p></p><p>If these outsiders behaved themselves, Gu Yang would not deliberately provoke them. But if they were foolish enough to not know their place, there would be no more words to say.</p><p></p><p>With the eleven Nascent Soul experts of the hidden guards, resolving any problems would not be too difficult. After all, any Nascent Soul expert was equivalent to a Fusion Spirit Realm cultivator, which was considered high-level even among the immortal sects.</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Yi was about to leave to carry out the orders, a figure suddenly appeared in the hall.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing this figure, Gu Yang and the others were momentarily stunned, but then their expressions turned joyful as they hurriedly bowed in reverence.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Father (We pay our respects to Your Eminence)!" </p><p></p><p>The person who had arrived was none other than Gu Qingfeng, who had just left the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the Gu Yang in front of him and said calmly, "There's no need to worry about the problems in the prefecture city, just act normally. With me here, they won't be able to overturn the situation!"</p><p></p><p>"Father is willing to guard the prefecture city, so the child is at ease!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Yang also felt a sense of relief.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of Gu Qingfeng was like a divine anchor, dispersing much of the pressure Gu Yang had previously faced.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi and the other bodyguards then withdrew as commanded.</p><p></p><p>The entire hall was left with only Gu Yang and Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"According to the intelligence from the bodyguards, the Tianyang Sword Sect will enter Guangyang Prefecture in a day. Should we first surround and weaken the Tianyang Sword Sect with a large army, and then have Father step in to resolve the Tianyang Sword Sect's problem?" </p><p></p><p>Gu Yang expressed his opinion.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng simply shook his head: "There's no need to be so troublesome. If the Tianyang Sword Sect wants to come, then let them come. They don't need any obstruction along the way.</p><p></p><p>This battle will attract many powerful experts, which is a good opportunity for them to see the strength of our Gu Family Manor."</p><p></p><p>"This battle, if you can slay the Ancient Overlord Tian, would be of great benefit to you."</p><p></p><p>"Without Ancient Overlord Tian, the Tianyang Sword Sect would not be considered a truly immortal sect. At that time, you can seize the momentum to directly take over the entire Taishan Prefecture, and then plan for Qingyun State."</p><p></p><p>"Only by occupying a state's territory can you truly have the qualifications to contend for the world."</p><p></p><p>The emergence of the Grand Master and the arrival of the Tianyang Sword Sect had already made Guangyang Prefecture the center of attention in the world.</p><p></p><p>Originally, according to Gu Qingfeng's original plan, he didn't want the Tianyang Sword Sect to enter Guangyang Prefecture, but instead take the initiative to directly slay Ancient Overlord Tian, nipping the threat in the bud.</p><p></p><p>But now,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had a different plan.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to obstruct Ancient Overlord Tian, but rather let him lead the Tianyang Sword Sect experts to directly enter Guangyang Prefecture, and then openly and righteously slay the opponent in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of doing this was naturally to establish his prestige.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p></p><p>Although the Gu Family Manor has destroyed many forces in recent years, and has a certain reputation in Taishan Prefecture and even Qingyun State, the gap between this reputation and that of an immortal sect is still immense.</p><p></p><p>But if this battle can slay Ancient Overlord Tian in front of everyone, the reputation of the Gu Family Manor will be elevated to the peak, and as the lord of the Gu Family Manor and the King of Guangyang, Gu Yang's reputation and prestige will also increase several times over.</p><p></p><p>Although the enhancement of this reputation and prestige will attract the enmity of many forces, it will also bring immense benefits.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Gu Qingfeng's words, Gu Yang's heart also pounded violently for a moment.</p><p></p><p>He was well aware that if his father could really do as he said, the benefits would be incalculable.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang still had some lingering concerns in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Father, how confident are you in slaying Ancient Overlord Tian?"</p><p></p><p>"Ten parts confident!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng uttered two words.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's heart shook again, and his expression immediately turned to great delight.</p><p></p><p>Given his understanding of Gu Qingfeng, the latter would never speak empty words.</p><p></p><p>Since his father said he had ten parts confidence, then it must be ten parts.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's remaining concerns about the upcoming battle were completely dispelled without a trace.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Outside the Whetstone Hall, a sound came. Gu Qingfeng opened his eyes, and a terrifying aura of the blade flashed and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Come in!"</p><p></p><p>His words fell.</p><p></p><p>The tightly closed doors of the Whetstone Hall were opened as if by an invisible hand, and Red Leaf walked in from the outside.</p><p></p><p>"I report to the esteemed one, this is a message from the imperial palace. Please take a look!"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she had already presented a secret letter with both hands.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng opened the secret letter and took a glance, his gaze slightly moving.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>he looked at the information panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' encountered an invading enemy and suppressed a sixth-stage Shenbian Realm cultivator by severing his finger!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' suppressed people of the Guiyuan Empire!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang'..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The Guiyuan Empire!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>When he saw that Gu Yang had suppressed a sixth-stage Shenbian Realm cultivator by severing his finger, Gu Qingfeng understood where the so-called severed finger came from.</p><p></p><p>Although that severed finger was left behind when Gu Qingfeng had just stepped into the Daogong Realm, it was incomparable to the current realm.</p><p></p><p>But even so,</p><p></p><p>that severed finger still had the divine might of the Daogong Realm.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing a sixth-stage Shenbian Realm cultivator was naturally not something worthy of shock.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng left the Whetstone Hall and headed for the imperial city.</p><p></p><p>In less than half a day,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng entered the imperial city.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang also came to see him immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Son pays respects to the father!"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that there are cultivators from outside the Nine States coming to attack. Where are they now?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng asked directly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said, "I have already imprisoned them all in the Heavenly Prison, waiting for the father to come and interrogate them!"</p><p></p><p>Regarding such powerful experts, Gu Yang was well aware that it would not be easy to make them speak the truth, so he simply invited Gu Qingfeng to come and see if he had any means to make them talk.</p><p></p><p>More importantly,</p><p></p><p>the forces behind Han An and the others involved the Guiyuan Empire, and Gu Yang did not dare to be careless.</p><p></p><p>The Guiyuan Empire! </p><p></p><p>That was a force that surpassed the dynasties.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had become the lord of a dynasty, Gu Yang naturally understood how powerful it was to wield the destiny of a dynasty.</p><p></p><p>If it was a dynasty, then it was already so powerful.</p><p></p><p>If it was an empire,</p><p></p><p>then it would be even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>In the dim Heavenly Prison, there was a damp and mossy smell.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng and Gu Yang walked into the Heavenly Prison, without any other guards following them.</p><p></p><p>"This Heavenly Prison is divided into nine layers. The first five layers are for imprisoning ordinary criminals, while the last four layers are for masters and above."</p><p></p><p>"Now those two are temporarily imprisoned on the ninth layer, which is made of mysterious iron. Even if a grand master exerts their full strength, it would be difficult for them to truly escape."</p><p></p><p>"If Shenbian Realm experts are imprisoned, as long as their cultivation is not fully recovered, they can also be suppressed!"</p><p></p><p>After entering the Heavenly Prison, Gu Yang patiently explained to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>To build this Heavenly Prison, he had spent a lot of effort.</p><p></p><p>Like the mysterious iron used on the ninth layer of the Heavenly Prison, it was a rare treasure in the Nine States. Even if ordinary people obtained a small amount and mixed it into their weapons, they could forge a divine weapon that could cut through iron like mud.</p><p></p><p>This shows the preciousness of the mysterious iron.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Yang was not the lord of the Nine States, he would not have been able to collect so much mysterious iron to build the ninth layer of the Heavenly Prison.</p><p></p><p>When the two entered the ninth layer of the Heavenly Prison, the place was as bright as day.</p><p></p><p>In the two adjacent cells, an old man and a young man were imprisoned.</p><p></p><p>The two were covered in blood, their ribs pierced by iron hooks, but their wounds did not bleed.</p><p></p><p>After hearing the sound of someone approaching, the old man, Ke Lao, leaning against the wall, opened his cloudy eyes and looked at Gu Yang with a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>"Old man advises you to be sensible and let us go. The Guiyuan Empire is not someone you can offend, even if your Shenwu Dynasty has a Daogong Realm expert as its pillar."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, we have left soul tablets in the Guiyuan Empire. If we perish, the empire will immediately sense it."</p><p></p><p>"When the imperial army of the empire arrives in the Nine States, you will regret it too late!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, Ke Lao was not panicked at all, still trying to intimidate with the might of the Guiyuan Empire.</p><p></p><p>In his view, since Gu Yang had not killed him, he must be wary of the Guiyuan Empire, so he would not dare to act rashly.</p><p></p><p>After all, even in the Eastern Domain, the Guiyuan Empire was a major force. A mere Shenwu Dynasty would be insignificant in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>faced with Ke Lao's words, Gu Yang's expression remained indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"I'll give you one more chance. Tell me the purpose of your coming and all the information about the Guiyuan Empire, and perhaps I can spare your life."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>Ke Lao snorted coldly without answering.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression suddenly turned cold, then he looked at Gu Qingfeng beside him.</p><p></p><p>"This person is a half-step Daogong Realm expert of the Guiyuan Empire. Unfortunately, his mouth is too stubborn, so I'll have to trouble the father to take care of him."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Gu Yang's words, Ke Lao finally looked at Gu Qingfeng beside him, his expression somewhat doubtful.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the Martial Saint Gu Qingfeng?"</p><p></p><p>This name,</p><p></p><p>Ke Lao was not unfamiliar with.</p><p></p><p>But in his calculations, this person should be a Shenbian Realm cultivator. If Gu Yang had not mentioned it, Ke Lao would have almost mistaken him for an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this,</p><p></p><p>Ke Lao's heart was shocked again.</p><p></p><p>Even though his cultivation was now sealed, a Shenbian Realm cultivator should not be able to hide their strength from him, but now he could not see through the other party's true power, which was somewhat intriguing.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you have heard of my existence."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stepped in front of Ke Lao, looking at him calmly.</p><p></p><p>To this,</p><p></p><p>Ke Lao remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head, "Judging from your appearance, even if I ask, you probably won't be willing to speak. Well, since you don't want to say it, then let me take a look myself!"</p><p></p><p>"You want to search my soul!"</p><p></p><p>Ke Lao seemed to have thought of something, his expression suddenly changing drastically, but then he sneered.</p><p></p><p>"You think you can search this old man's soul? Wishful thinking—"</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>before Ke Lao could finish his words, a terrifying spiritual force from Gu Qingfeng had already forcefully invaded his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>At that moment,</p><p></p><p>Ke Lao's face changed drastically, and his gaze became increasingly frightened.</p><p></p><p>"Daogong—"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he uttered these two words, his expression became dull.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's spiritual sense was rampantly searching through the other's memories, and he soon found a lot of information.</p><p></p><p>The only regret was that the person in front of him was a half-step Daogong Realm expert. Although he had not truly opened the Daogong and cultivated his primordial spirit, his spiritual sense was still quite powerful.</p><p></p><p>And with the other party having lived for thousands of years, his memories were extremely long. Even if Gu Qingfeng wanted to thoroughly examine all his memories, it would be difficult to do so.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>despite this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng still obtained the information he wanted.</p><p></p><p>"The Guiyuan Empire!"</p><p></p><p>"Imperial Worship!"</p><p></p><p>"Beast Taming Technique... Saint's Legacy!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured, his gaze towards the other party now filled with understanding.</p><p></p><p>In Ke Lao's memories, the Guiyuan Empire was established by a half-saint expert ten thousand years ago.</p><p></p><p>Since then,</p><p></p><p>the power of the Guiyuan Empire has been growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>Now,</p><p></p><p>although the Guiyuan Empire does not have a half-saint level expert as its pillar, it does have several Daogong Realm experts, and the one who controls the Guiyuan Empire, Emperor Han, is even a ninth-stage Daogong Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>As long as he does not encounter any unexpected calamity, he may very well step into the half-saint realm in the future.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also understood why Ke Lao and the others were able to find the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>They knew the Beast Taming Technique, controlling a large number of fierce beasts to roam the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, and then based on the feedback from these fierce beasts, they were able to locate the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>It has to be said that</p><p></p><p>this kind of method is quite surprising to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>It also indirectly explains the fundamental reason why the number of fierce beasts causing havoc in the Nine States has been increasing.</p><p></p><p>As for the purpose of the two, it was just as Gu Qingfeng had guessed - they came for the Saint's Legacy.</p><p></p><p>Even the Guiyuan Empire, which once had a half-saint as its pillar, highly valued the Saint's Legacy.</p><p></p><p>With the Saint's Legacy or without it, the difference in strength could be heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng's spiritual sense withdrew, Ke Lao's face was deathly pale, and his gaze towards Gu Qingfeng was filled with both terror and mockery.</p><p></p><p>"You already know the strength of my Guiyuan Empire. If you release us now, there is still room for negotiation. Otherwise, it will be a dead end—"</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Before Ke Lao could finish speaking, Gu Qingfeng flicked his finger, causing his head to explode and die on the spot.</p><p></p><p>While Shenbian Realm experts could regenerate their severed limbs, they could not regrow their heads once they were destroyed.</p><p></p><p>"Ke Lao!!"</p><p></p><p>In the adjacent cell, Han An saw the headless corpse and could no longer suppress the terror in his heart. Looking at Gu Qingfeng, his face was filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>"Don't kill me!"</p><p></p><p>"I am the Sixth Prince of the Guiyuan Empire. If you kill me, my father the emperor will not let you off!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Gu Qingfeng did not respond, but instead came directly to his cell, Han An's heart became even more terrified.</p><p></p><p>"I'll tell you!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll say anything, just don't kill me... don't..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke,</p><p></p><p>a warm flow had already leaked from Han An's crotch, the Sixth Prince of the Guiyuan Empire had been completely frightened out of his wits.</p><p></p><p>"I still believe what I saw."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head, then immediately used his methods to search Han An's mind.</p><p></p><p>Searching Han An's memories was much easier than searching Ke Lao's, after all, the gap in their realms was not small.</p><p></p><p>The former was only at the sixth stage of the Shenbian Realm, while the latter had already reached the half-step Daogong Realm.</p><p></p><p>Very soon,</p><p></p><p>Han An's memories were thoroughly searched.</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Qingfeng was about to focus on searching for the cultivation techniques of the Guiyuan Empire, suddenly, a huge spiritual sense abruptly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to pry into the legacy of my Guiyuan Empire? Seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>The spiritual sense erupted. Such a terrifying aura could crush ordinary Daogong Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Qingfeng's eyes turned cold, and he responded with his own spiritual sense in kind.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Suppression.</p><p></p><p>"Boom—"</p><p></p><p>The two forces collided, and the divine consciousness was easily crushed.</p><p></p><p>But in the moment the divine consciousness was suppressed, Han An's head also exploded, without a trace of life.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Han An's death, Gu Qingfeng shook his head with some regret.</p><p></p><p>The Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty was a top-tier force, and it had also produced a half-Saint-level expert in the past. The inheritance of this force must not be underestimated, and it might even be stronger than the inheritance of the Divine Yang Holy Land.</p><p></p><p>Han An, as the Sixth Prince of the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty, had a high chance of possessing the complete inheritance of the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>What a pity.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of his sea of consciousness, a powerful expert had laid down a prohibition. If any cultivator dared to explore and search for its inheritance memories, this power would be triggered.</p><p></p><p>This prohibition was either to kill the intruder, or if it couldn't kill them, it would erase the vessel to prevent the leakage of the imperial dynasty's inheritance.</p><p></p><p>Recalling that vast divine consciousness, there was the tyrannical aura of an emperor. Gu Qingfeng suspected that it was the Han Emperor of the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>A peak expert at the Dao Palace Realm Ninth Layer.</p><p></p><p>However, although the Han Emperor's strength was formidable, the remnant divine consciousness left on Han An was only a fraction of his power, and naturally, he would not be Gu Qingfeng's opponent.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao Palace Realm Ninth Layer doesn't seem as strong as I imagined!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes flickered, and then he quickly recovered.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at the dead Han An and couldn't help but ask, "Father, how did the soul search turn out?"</p><p></p><p>"It's almost done. Originally, I wanted to obtain the inheritance of the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty from this child, but unfortunately, his sea of consciousness had a Dao Palace prohibition. If anyone tried to search his soul, this prohibition would be triggered."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said regretfully.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang's expression became somewhat grave, and then he ordered the jailers behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Clean up these corpses!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The jailers immediately carried out the order.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>The Primal Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Domain.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>In the imperial court, a middle-aged emperor sat on the throne, his expression solemn. His deep black eyes were as profound as an abyss, and his brows exuded the tyranny of an emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm..."</p><p></p><p>The Han Emperor, who was originally listening to the reports of the ministers below, suddenly frowned, and then his eyes shot out cold killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to pry into the inheritance of my Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty!"</p><p></p><p>The words had barely left his mouth when a tyrannical and unparalleled aura suddenly erupted, causing the entire imperial court to be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>All the ministers changed expression, and under that aura of pressure, they instinctively knelt on the ground, their bodies trembling.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Han Emperor also realized his own loss of composure, and the aura on his body suddenly receded, allowing the ministers to stand up from the ground, trembling.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, an elder minister cupped his hands and asked, "May I ask why Your Majesty is so enraged?"</p><p></p><p>"The prohibition on the inheritance of the Sixth Prince has been triggered!"</p><p></p><p>The Han Emperor uttered a sentence, and upon hearing this, the ministers' expressions changed again.</p><p></p><p>They naturally understood the meaning of the inheritance prohibition the Han Emperor was referring to. When the inheritance prohibition was triggered, it meant that someone had dared to attempt a soul search.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, after the Han Emperor's anger had subsided, he was also pondering who had made the move.</p><p></p><p>After all, although Han An's strength was not strong, the other party had the protection of the imperial clan and Ke Lao, who had one foot in the Dao Palace Realm, and their strength was not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Han An also had a life-saving trump card bestowed by the imperial clan.</p><p></p><p>Normally, even if he encountered danger, he should have been able to escape without any problems.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Han An was backed by the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty, and other forces should not be unaware of this.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the Han Emperor thought of something.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a guard hurriedly came in and cupped his hands to the Han Emperor, saying, "Your Majesty, the soul token of Ke Lao and the Sixth Prince has been shattered!"</p><p></p><p>These words shocked the entire court.</p><p></p><p>The shattering of the soul token meant that the person who had left the soul token had perished.</p><p></p><p>If it was just the death of an imperial clan protector, it would have been fine, but now a prince had also died, the consequences would be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>However, the Han Emperor did not have the level of anger that was expected. When he learned that someone had attempted a soul search to seize the inheritance of the imperial dynasty, he had already anticipated Han An's fate.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the other party had completely torn off the mask with the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>"Dismiss the court!"</p><p></p><p>The Han Emperor said coldly, directly announcing the dismissal of the court.</p><p></p><p>The ministers dared not say anything more, and could only bow and withdraw, except for one person who remained standing in place.</p><p></p><p>After everyone had left, the Han Emperor looked at the person in front of him and said, "An'er, I ordered you to enter the Ancient Beast Mountain Range to search for the traces of the Saint's inheritance. Now that you and Ke Lao have perished, it is likely related to the Saint's inheritance."</p><p></p><p>"You must immediately lead the Divine Emperor Army to the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, and must bring back the Saint's inheritance. Also, find out who killed An'er."</p><p></p><p>"Any who dare to go against my Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty will only have the path of death!"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, the Han Emperor's face was filled with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>He had many descendants, and the loss of just one Sixth Prince would not have enraged him so much.</p><p></p><p>What truly angered the Han Emperor was that the other party had slapped the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty in the face, and it was likely related to the Saint's inheritance.</p><p></p><p>These two were what the Han Emperor truly valued.</p><p></p><p>The person in front of him was Jing Meng, a great general of the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty, whose cultivation had already reached the Dao Palace Realm Seventh Layer, and could be considered one of the top experts in the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty. His command of the hundred thousand Divine Emperor Army was also extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Han Emperor had ordered Jing Meng to lead the Divine Emperor Army into the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, it showed how important this matter was to him.</p><p></p><p>"I will carry out the order!"</p><p></p><p>Jing Meng cupped his hands and accepted the command.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Back in the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng informed Gu Yang of all the information he had obtained from the soul search.</p><p></p><p>"The Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty is not weak, it is a top-tier imperial dynasty in the Eastern Domain. It was founded by a half-Saint-level expert ten thousand years ago, and even after that half-Saint's demise, the strength of the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty has not fallen much.</p><p></p><p>The current emperor of the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty is a powerful expert at the Dao Palace Realm Ninth Layer."</p><p></p><p>"As that elder said, they all had soul tokens left in the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty, and now that the two of them have perished, the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty must have learned of the news."</p><p></p><p>These words made Gu Yang's expression become extremely serious.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Palace Realm was an existence that surpassed the Divine Transformation Realm, and the Dao Palace Realm Ninth Layer was almost able to step one foot into the Saint Realm.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful expert naturally made Gu Yang feel immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>"What is the purpose of the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty in coming here?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang asked the question that was on his mind.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng calmly replied, "They have come here only to obtain the Saint's inheritance."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng also mentioned the matters regarding the Divine Martial Sect and Mu Rong Xiu, and it was only at this moment that Gu Yang truly understood the purpose of the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty, as well as the challenges the Divine Martial Kingdom would face in the future.</p><p></p><p>Excluding Gu Qingfeng and the four Gu Family Elders, the Divine Martial Kingdom did not have a single expert at the Divine Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if the four Elders at the Divine Transformation Realm Ninth Layer were included, they would still be somewhat lacking in the face of the Dao Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty had a Dao Palace Realm Ninth Layer expert as its pillar.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Gu Yang couldn't help but look at Gu Qingfeng and ask, "Father, what is your current cultivation level? If the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty were to attack, how much chance would you have?"</p><p></p><p>"For now, just consider me to be at the Dao Palace Realm. As long as the Saint does not appear, the problems should not be too great."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered for a moment and revealed a bit about his own strength.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, although he was currently only at the Dao Palace Realm Fourth Layer, his foundation was far beyond what a typical Dao Palace Realm Fourth Layer expert could match.</p><p></p><p>From the prohibition in Han An's sea of consciousness, it seemed that even the Dao Palace Realm Ninth Layer was not as strong as he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, even if he were to face a Dao Palace Realm Ninth Layer expert, Gu Qingfeng would have the confidence to fight.</p><p></p><p>These words put Gu Yang's heart at ease, and his gaze towards Gu Qingfeng was filled with admiration.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Saint does not appear, there would be no major problems.</p><p></p><p>In that case, even if the Dao Palace Realm Ninth Layer expert of the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty were to come in person, there would not be much of an issue? Taking a deep breath, Gu Yang said, "With Father's words, I am reassured. Since they are here for the Saint's inheritance, then the two from the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty are just the beginning.</p><p></p><p>I will order people to thoroughly search all the states, and closely monitor the Ancient Beast Mountain Range. If any other powerful experts from the Eastern Domain were to come, the court will be the first to know."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore—"</p><p></p><p>"I think the White Stone Dao is too small, how about I find a place in the imperial capital to serve as the foundation of the Gu Family Manor?"</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Gu Qingfeng's response, Gu Yang sighed and said, "I'm not afraid of Father's ridicule, but in the current situation, the court is ultimately lacking in powerful experts to guard it. If Father could take up residence in the imperial capital, I believe it would solve many troubles.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if Father is unwilling, I will not force you."</p><p></p><p>Although he said this, the burning gaze in Gu Yang's eyes made Gu Qingfeng understand that he had no way to refuse.</p><p></p><p>But for Gu Qingfeng, whether the Gu Family Manor was in the White Stone Dao or in the imperial capital, it made no difference.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since you have spoken, I will grant your wish."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded in agreement under Gu Yang's expectant gaze.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Yang was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Good, then Father can rest here in the imperial palace first. I will immediately order people to move the Gu Family Manor here. Now, there are many places in the imperial capital, I wonder where Father would like the Gu Family Manor to be located?"</p><p></p><p>"You can arrange it as you see fit."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng waved his hand, not caring about these matters.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang did not hesitate. He first had people arrange for Gu Qingfeng to rest, and then immediately set out to find a suitable place for the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also took action on the White Stone Dao side.</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family Manor had taken root in the White Stone Dao for decades, and its foundation was also quite solid. Now that it was to be relocated, it was not a simple matter.</p><p></p><p>But with Gu Yang mobilizing the power of the court, these matters became much simpler.</p><p></p><p>In less than ten days, the massive Gu Family Manor had been completely moved to the imperial capital.</p><p></p><p>The former Guangyang Wang Fu had now been completely rebuilt by Gu Yang and served as the new Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>This news shook the imperial capital.</p><p></p><p>On the day the Gu Family Manor reopened, various officials and forces from the jianghu came to pay visits. Gu Qingfeng did not personally handle these matters, only letting Gu Peng take care of them, while he himself continued to seclude himself and continue his comprehension of the Primal Chaos Heaven Sword.

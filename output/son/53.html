        <h1>Chapter 53</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If the Patriarch is willing to lend a hand, there won't be any problems!" </p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Ye Nanqiu's expression also brightened.</p><p></p><p>If the Patriarch of the Qingyang Sect was willing to get involved, then the Gu family would have no chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>In that case, Ye Shi's grudge could be considered avenged.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Qingyang Sect let out a cold, mocking laugh: "No one who offends my Qingyang Sect can survive, not even Guan Nanhai back in the day, let alone this insignificant Gu Qingfeng. </p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that the Taixuan Dynasty is still powerful, and Baishi City is under the court's jurisdiction, I would have wanted to perform a blood sacrifice and wipe out the entire Baishi City."</p><p></p><p>"If I could perform a blood sacrifice on the entire Baishi City, I would be able to advance even further... it's just a pity!"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Qingyang Sect licked his lips, suppressing the impulse within.</p><p></p><p>Performing a blood sacrifice on Baishi City would be easy, but the consequences that would have to be borne afterwards would not be so simple.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Ye Nanqiu said, "Pei Jing has also sent people to contact our Qingyang Sect, trying to get us to cooperate with him. If we cooperate with him, and Pei Jing conquers Guangyang Prefecture, giving a Baishi City to our Qingyang Sect, I don't think there would be any major problems."</p><p></p><p>"The matter is not as simple as you think," the Patriarch of the Qingyang Sect shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Pei Jing is backed by the Tianyang Sword Sect, with the Tianyang Sword Sect involved, how can our Qingyang Sect get a share?"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the forces involved here are not just the Tianyang Sword Sect alone. As long as the two sides have not determined the victor, our Qingyang Sect does not need to rush to take a side. </p><p></p><p>After all, if we choose the wrong side, our centuries-old foundation might be destroyed in a single day."</p><p></p><p>"Wait until the situation becomes clearer, then we can make the next move."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, if I can advance even further, our Qingyang Sect will have more say in the future chaos."</p><p></p><p>In this world, it is ultimately strength that speaks.</p><p></p><p>This is something the Patriarch of the Qingyang Sect, who has lived for hundreds of years, naturally understands.</p><p></p><p>"In recent years, the court has also made major moves, with many people from the Zhenxie Supervisorate coming to Guangyang Prefecture, seemingly preparing to suppress a powerful evil entity.</p><p></p><p>But I've heard that in that battle, the Zhenxie Supervisorate and that evil entity both suffered heavy losses, and the surrounding area has become a forbidden zone."</p><p></p><p>"The rumor is that the evil entity is comparable to a calamity-level being. Such a powerful evil entity is not to be trifled with. If we have the opportunity to subdue and devour it, our Qingyang Sect may one day be on par with those ancient sects and noble families."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, you can also take this opportunity to refine the evil into your body, becoming a Sorcerer and glimpsing the path to immortality!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Nanqiu's expression also became slightly excited, but he still had some concerns.</p><p></p><p>"The Zhenxie Supervisorate couldn't even handle the evil entity, I'm afraid our Qingyang Sect won't find it so easy either."</p><p></p><p>To this, the Patriarch of the Qingyang Sect coldly laughed, "You can rest assured. If it were a calamity-level evil entity in its prime, it would indeed be difficult to deal with. But since the Zhenxie Supervisorate and that evil entity have both suffered heavy losses, as long as I, the Patriarch, break through further, suppressing that evil entity will not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>This is an opportunity for the rise of our Qingyang Sect, and we cannot miss it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, I have also gained some insight into the location of that evil entity in the past two years.</p><p></p><p>Next, I only need to break through, and I can then set about suppressing that evil entity!"</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why he needs three thousand young boys and girls.</p><p></p><p>With hundreds of years of accumulation, the Patriarch of the Qingyang Sect is only one step away from a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Now, he needs to devour more living beings' blood and flesh to take that crucial step.</p><p></p><p>Every step for a Sorcerer is of utmost importance. The breakthrough at the final hurdle can mean the difference between two completely different concepts.</p><p></p><p>Saying this, the Patriarch of the Qingyang Sect's gaze became gloomy again.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>His expression suddenly became much more ferocious.</p><p></p><p>"If the strength of our Qingyang Sect could advance further, even if we were to slaughter a White Stone City, what would that matter? </p><p></p><p>Those ancient ancestral sects have always been no strangers to the acts of wiping out cities and destroying lands, yet the imperial court has never expressed any dissatisfaction!"</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestor's words are absolutely right!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Nanqiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>The Qingyang Ancestor looked at him again and said indifferently, "As for Ye Shi's death, you don't need to worry too much about it. He was just a descendant, and once he's dead, he's dead. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div> We pursue longevity and immortality. As long as we can live, we need not worry about the continuation of our bloodline."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Nanqiu bowed his head in response again.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a disciple of the Qingyang Sect hurriedly rushed in.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the Qingyang Ancestor, the other party first obviously paused, and then said to Ye Nanqiu.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, we have a major crisis!"</p><p></p><p>"What is so alarming?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Nanqiu frowned.</p><p></p><p>The disciple said, "News has come that Gu Qingfeng, leading the powerful members of the Gu Clan, are heading towards our Qingyang Sect and will soon be entering our mountain gate!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell,</p><p></p><p>Ye Nanqiu suddenly became furious.</p><p></p><p>"The Gu Clan has such audacity!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that,</p><p></p><p>Ye Nanqiu looked towards the seat of the Qingyang Ancestor, and the angry expression on his face was greatly suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"The Gu Clan has come, obviously intending to harm our Qingyang Sect. Will the Ancestor personally take action?"</p><p></p><p>"Very well!"</p><p></p><p>The Qingyang Ancestor's expression became even more gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"The Gu Clan dares to come knocking on our door directly, and I shall see what gives them the courage to do so--"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the disciple who heard Ye Nanqiu's words was also startled.</p><p></p><p>Ancestor?</p><p></p><p>He did not know that the Qingyang Sect still had another Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, he couldn't help but look up at the Qingyang Ancestor, and just happened to meet the latter's deep green gaze, and a sense of foreboding suddenly surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after,</p><p></p><p>The shadow of the Qingyang Ancestor, from who knows when, had already extended countless black tentacles, and before the disciple could react, they pierced through his body like sharp swords.</p><p></p><p>The sudden, excruciating pain made the latter let out a shrill scream.</p><p></p><p>But in the next breath,</p><p></p><p>The disciple's skin was seen to be shriveling up at a visible speed, as if his flesh and blood had completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>After a moment,</p><p></p><p>The disciple turned into a dried corpse and fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>All the black shadows also receded like the tide.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene,</p><p></p><p>Ye Nanqiu's expression did not change, as if he was accustomed to it.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's go meet that Gu Clan patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>After devouring the flesh and blood of a person, the Qingyang Ancestor's complexion seemed to have become a little more ruddy, with his hands clasped behind his back, he walked slowly out of the main hall, and Ye Nanqiu immediately followed closely behind him.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Qingyang Sect,</p><p></p><p>Three hundred light cavalry were breaking through the ancient road.</p><p></p><p>When they arrived in front of the Qingyang Sect's mountain gate, all the light cavalry stopped.</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng came to the front of the carriage and whispered, "Reporting to the Patriarch, the Qingyang Sect has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng lifted the curtain and stepped out of the carriage. In front of him, at the gate of the Qingyang Sect, there were already many disciples standing in formation, ready for battle.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Qingyang Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the Qingyang Sect disciples in front of him, and with a glance, most of the disciples' auras were at the Refine Skin Realm, and a few were at the Refine Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Among them, some with stronger auras had even reached the level of Refine Blood Perfection.</p><p></p><p>From this, one could also see the foundation of this major sect.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

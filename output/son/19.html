        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the inner courtyard of the Gu family, Meng Peng's demeanor was extremely respectful, and his gaze towards Gu Qingfeng was filled with awe and reverence for the powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>He had witnessed the battle outside White Stone City with his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>Qin Family's Elder Qin Wei and Iron Bone Gang's Spiritual Cultivation Hall Master Si Yuanhao, two renowned experts in the White Stone Dao, were directly killed on the spot by the other party.</p><p></p><p>Relying on his own strength, he had slain six Blood Refining Realm martial artists, and the weakest among them was at the middle-stage of the Blood Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>Such strength could be considered top-tier in the entire White Stone Dao.</p><p></p><p>Up until now, Meng Peng had always thought that Gu Qingfeng was just an ordinary Blood Refining Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The reason he joined the Gu family was to see if he had a chance to learn the Gu family's mid-grade martial arts, and nothing more.</p><p></p><p>But now, Meng Peng had put aside all his small thoughts, and the slight disloyalty he had harbored had completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, with Gu Qingfeng's terrifying strength, it was not impossible for the Gu family to eventually become the hegemon of the White Stone Dao in the future.</p><p></p><p>In the current chaotic world, the court's control over the various local powers was weak.</p><p></p><p>The powerful martial artists who had established their own family sects could completely avoid the court's control.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Gu family had just started, if Meng Peng closely followed Gu Qingfeng and wholeheartedly devoted himself to serving him, when the Gu family rose to prominence, he would undoubtedly reap the benefits.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, if he were to betray the Gu family, in Meng Peng's view, he might not have a place to call home in the entire White Stone Dao.</p><p></p><p>From the fact that Gu Qingfeng did not even blink an eye before directly using thunderous methods to subdue six Blood Refining Realm cultivators, it was evident.</p><p></p><p>"How is the situation?" Gu Qingfeng asked indifferently, aware of the awe in the other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>This was the effect Gu Qingfeng wanted to see.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family did not have many usable people in the White Stone Dao, and Meng Peng had performed well in various aspects over the years, which was why Gu Qingfeng had brought him along to seize the Scorching Sun Divine Palm.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of this was to demonstrate sufficient strength and instill a sense of awe in the other party.</p><p></p><p>Loyalty often requires strength as a deterrent.</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng respectfully said, "Now, the Qin Family and the Iron Bone Gang are furious and are extensively searching for that mysterious expert, but no one is aware that the mysterious expert is the Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, on the Tian Yun Sect side, the matter of the two major powers ambushing Yun Tianxing has also been exposed, and the Tian Yun Sect is unlikely to let it go easily!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Qingfeng nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Yun Sect was, after all, a major power in the White Stone Dao, and although its strength was not as great as the Qin Family and the Iron Bone Gang, it was still not to be taken lightly.</p><p></p><p>If the two parties had not truly exposed their identities, the Tian Yun Sect might have just turned a blind eye and swallowed this bitter pill.</p><p></p><p>But now, since the identities of the Qin Family and the Iron Bone Gang's people have been exposed, the Tian Yun Sect would not let it go.</p><p></p><p>With this, the White Stone Dao was destined to become chaotic.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Qingfeng's eyes, these events only brought benefits and no harm to the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>After all, the more chaotic the White Stone Dao became, the more room the Gu family would have for development.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, this battle had given Gu Qingfeng a comprehensive understanding of his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Although he was currently only at the middle-stage of the Blood Refining Realm, if he were to go all-out, he would be able to match the peak Blood Refining Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the entire White Stone Dao, there were only a few peak Blood Refining Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>The only regret was that the Gu family's foundation was still somewhat shallow.</p><p></p><p>In the vast Gu family, Gu Qingfeng was the only one who had reached the Blood Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even if his strength was on par with the peak of Blood Refining, it would still be difficult for him to overwhelm the entire White Stone Dao.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the day,</p><p></p><p>The mighty dragon cannot suppress the local snake.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the forces in the White Stone Dao, the Gu family was only an outsider.</p><p></p><p>If they had maintained a low profile in the past, it would have been fine. But if they were to expose the fact that they had a peak Blood Refining expert as their pillar, they would inevitably become the target of other forces.</p><p></p><p>Even though Gu Qingfeng was extremely confident in his own abilities, he did not have the confidence to confront the entire White Stone Dao.</p><p></p><p>Unless...</p><p></p><p>He could break through the limits of the Blood Refining realm and advance to an even higher level.</p><p></p><p>But to achieve that breakthrough, it was easier said than done.</p><p></p><p>It took Gu Qingfeng nearly ten years to advance from the initial stage of Skin Refining to the middle stage of Blood Refining.</p><p></p><p>To advance from the middle stage of Blood Refining to an even higher level, it would undoubtedly require an even longer time.</p><p></p><p>The lifespan of a Blood Refining cultivator is a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had already lived through a third of that.</p><p></p><p>His current goal was very simple - as long as he could break through to an even higher realm before the age of fifty, then his lifespan could be extended a little further.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, Gu Qingfeng looked at Meng Peng and said in a deep voice, "You have done well in this matter. I am aware of your purpose for joining the Gu family. As long as you wholeheartedly serve the Gu family, I will give you the opportunity to break through the Blood Refining realm!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Gu Qingfeng took out a secret manual from his bosom and handed it to Meng Peng.</p><p></p><p>"This is half of the Gu family's fist technique. If you can cultivate it to perfection, I will pass on the other half to you, and then you can make the breakthrough. However, the Gu family's techniques are of great importance, and you absolutely cannot transmit them without permission, or else the consequences will be dire!"</p><p></p><p>"Your subordinate will devote himself to serving the Patriarch!" Meng Peng replied, holding the Gu family's fist technique in his hands, his expression filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Even though what was in his hands was only half of the technique, and it did not involve Blood Refining, Meng Peng still saw it as a tremendous opportunity. Compared to the ordinary low-grade martial arts he had cultivated, this was a mid-grade martial art, which was far more profound.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you may leave now," Gu Qingfeng said.</p><p></p><p>"Your subordinate takes his leave," Meng Peng replied and left.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng watched Meng Peng's retreating figure, his eyes narrowing slightly. Then, he took out a golden lacquered box from his bosom, opened it, and a thin secret manual was revealed, the cover of which was clearly marked with the words "Scorching Sun Divine Palm".</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Gu Qingfeng had obtained a top-tier mid-grade martial art, and he was somewhat excited. He immediately opened the Scorching Sun Divine Palm and began to carefully read and study it.</p><p></p><p>As he delved deeper into the Scorching Sun Divine Palm, Gu Qingfeng could understand the profundity of this martial art. Compared to his previous Gu family fist technique and the Iron Body Sutra, it was simply incomparable.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, Gu Qingfeng put down the Scorching Sun Divine Palm, his eyes filled with a sense of awe.</p><p></p><p>"The Scorching Sun Divine Palm is truly a top-tier mid-grade martial art. The depth of this supreme technique is such that even the breakthrough-level Gu family fist technique and the Iron Body Sutra cannot match it."</p><p></p><p>Generally, martial arts are divided into four stages: Initiation, Mastery, Perfection, and Completion. But the Scorching Sun Divine Palm was different.</p><p></p><p>The Scorching Sun Divine Palm was divided into nine layers, and each layer was further divided into four stages: Initiation, Mastery, Perfection, and Completion. The first four layers corresponded to the four stages of Skin Refining, while the latter four layers corresponded to the four stages of Blood Refining. As for the ninth layer, it had already reached the realm of Half-step Bone Refining.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

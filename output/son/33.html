        <h1>Chapter 33</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Many people had pale faces, the overwhelming bloody smell made them feel the urge to vomit.</p><p></p><p>When they looked at Gu Qingfeng, there was a hint of terror and fear in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Iron Bone Gang and the Chu family had already been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Now the Qin family had also been wiped out to the last person.</p><p></p><p>This Gu family patriarch, if he didn't make a move, it would be fine. But once he did, he would wipe out an entire family.</p><p></p><p>Such ruthless methods made them feel extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>After all, there are often conflicts and killings in the jianghu (martial arts world).</p><p></p><p>But to wipe out an entire family is not something commonly done.</p><p></p><p>The main reason is that it would easily tarnish one's reputation.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who is active in the jianghu values their reputation and image. If they were to cause large-scale slaughter, it would only bring them trouble.</p><p></p><p>However, these concerns seemed to not exist at all in front of Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the Gu family had been low-key, and they didn't have a clear understanding of the Gu family. But the scene unfolding before their eyes completely overturned their perception.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Gu Qingfeng was also labeled as someone not to be easily provoked.</p><p></p><p>Being able to wipe out an entire family at the drop of a hat, who could withstand this?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In less than half a day, the Qin family had no survivors left.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had Meng Peng ransack the Qin family, bringing everything back to the Gu family, and then he turned and left.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, someone finally dared to cross the many corpses in front of the Qin family's door and enter the Qin family's residence.</p><p></p><p>Only to find that the once grand Qin family had become a deathly silent place, with a pungent bloody smell permeating the air.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, many people's faces turned pale again.</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long for the news of the Qin family's destruction to spread.</p><p></p><p>This news shook the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>The Qin family, as an old aristocratic family of the Baishi Dao, had now been wiped out in a single day, which had a huge impact.</p><p></p><p>Especially when it became clear that it was Gu Qingfeng who had destroyed the Qin family, many forces secretly shuddered and regretted.</p><p></p><p>No one had expected that the Gu family would really dare to act in such a way.</p><p></p><p>In just three days, they had directly wiped out the Qin family.</p><p></p><p>The various forces that had originally wanted to laugh at the Gu family suddenly found themselves becoming the laughingstock.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, many force leaders were scared out of their wits, hurriedly going to the Gu family, afraid that the next second, the Gu family's butcher's knife would fall on their own heads.</p><p></p><p>However, there were also many forces that were furious about the Qin family's destruction, and they united together, intending to prepare to deal with the Gu family collectively.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Tianyun Sect, the news of the Qin family's destruction was immediately transmitted to Yun Tianxing.</p><p></p><p>The Tianyun Sect Master's face turned deathly pale upon hearing this news.</p><p></p><p>"The Qin family has been destroyed!" </p><p></p><p>Yun Tianxing said to the sect disciple in front of him, who nodded and revealed a fearful expression, as if he had thought of some terrible thing.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, the Qin family has been wiped out. The Qin family's patriarch was killed by Gu Qingfeng in just a few moves, the Qin family's master Qin Hongtang has perished, and now the entire Qin family has been slaughtered by the Gu family, not even a dog or chicken left!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it--"</p><p></p><p>Yun Tianxing's face changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>He had not expected that Gu Qingfeng would act so ruthlessly, completely disregarding the reactions of the various forces in the jianghu, and directly strike hard at the Qin family.</p><p></p><p>The grand Qin family legacy had been reduced to nothing in a single day. </p><p></p><p>This result made Yun Tianxing feel terrified.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Yun Tianxing went to inform Yun Changkong of this news.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>When the latter heard this news, his expression also changed, completely not expecting that the Qin family would be directly wiped out.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>Yunchangkong sneered, "Good, this is Gu family's self-isolation from the Baishi Dao. This is the opportunity for the rise of our Tianyun Sect. Now that the Iron Bone Gang and the Qin family have been destroyed, as long as we can resolve the Gu family, the Tianyun Sect will be the number one force in the Baishi Dao!"</p><p></p><p>"Gu Qingfeng is so powerful, can the Grand Elder deal with him?"</p><p></p><p>Yun Tianxing's face was filled with worry.</p><p></p><p>Yunchangkong said.</p><p></p><p>"Even though Gu Qingfeng is strong, he is only at the Refining Blood Realm. He has not broken through the Refining Bone Realm, so he is still not much of a threat. Moreover, even if he has entered the Refining Bone Realm, what of it?</p><p></p><p>Although Refining Bone Realm cultivators are powerful, they are not completely invincible.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Qin family has been destroyed, many forces in the rivers and lakes are in danger. The Tianyun Sect can use this as an excuse to directly unite with some of these forces to deal with the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>As long as we have enough people, even if we just pile on top of him, we can directly bury Gu Qingfeng to death!"</p><p></p><p>The Qin family has been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>At first, Yunchangkong was shocked, but he soon realized that this was the opportunity for the Tianyun Sect.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful a Refining Bone Realm cultivator is, as long as there are enough people, they can still be buried to death.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it is still unknown whether Gu Qingfeng has entered the Refining Bone Realm.</p><p></p><p>If the other party is only at the peak of the Refining Blood Realm or half-step Refining Bone, then it will be even easier to deal with.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Qingfeng had not destroyed the Qin family, it would not have been so easy for the Tianyun Sect to unite the various forces.</p><p></p><p>After all, before the critical moment, the rivers and lakes of the Baishi Dao were still in disarray.</p><p></p><p>But now that the Qin family has been destroyed, many forces feel threatened. At this time, as long as the Tianyun Sect takes the lead, it will be easy to unite a force.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Gu family is destroyed, the Tianyun Sect will surely rise.</p><p></p><p>Yunchangkong's words also made Yun Tianxing's eyes light up.</p><p></p><p>That's right.</p><p></p><p>This is indeed the opportunity for the rise of the Tianyun Sect.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he was shocked by the news of the destruction of the Qin family, but he didn't think of this aspect.</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master can immediately contact the various forces and then work together to deal with the Gu family!"</p><p></p><p>"Good--"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Gu family's main hall.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sat in the main seat, and the rest were Meng Peng, Gu Yang, and several other power holders of various forces.</p><p></p><p>Unlike before, now Mao Rong and the others were sitting upright and respectful, their faces full of awe when looking at the person in the main seat.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the Qin family's ancestor, and slaying the Qin family's patriarch Qin Hongtan, Gu Qingfeng had displayed an astonishingly powerful strength.</p><p></p><p>This terrifying strength was something they could not resist.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "The Qin family has been rampant in the Baishi Dao for many years, and they have numerous industries. Since the Gu family currently has limited manpower, the task of taking over the Qin family's industries will be arranged by you four families.</p><p></p><p>However, I have one requirement, that is, 50% of the future profits from all of the Qin family's industries must be handed over to the Gu family, and the remaining 50% will belong to each of you.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, 30% of the profits from your original industries must also be regularly handed over to the Gu family every year."</p><p></p><p>"No problem!"</p><p></p><p>"Everything will be as the Gu Family Master commands--"</p><p></p><p>Mao Rong and the others all had delighted expressions on their faces, hastily cupping their fists and speaking.</p><p></p><p>The Qin family had numerous industries, and even just a portion of those industries would be more than what their own forces could compare to. If they could swallow these industries, it would greatly increase their own strength.</p><p></p><p>Even though they could only take 50% of the profits, and had to hand over 30% of the profits from their original industries to the Gu family, when calculated carefully, it was still a profitable deal.</p><p></p><p>So, they had no reason to refuse.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

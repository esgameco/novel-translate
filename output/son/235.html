        <h1>Chapter 235</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qu Huadao suddenly made a move. </p><p></p><p>He directly unleashed a divine sword, manipulating the spiritual energy from hundreds of miles to converge. The once docile spiritual energy of heaven and earth had now transformed into terrifying sword qi.</p><p></p><p>"Perish!"</p><p></p><p>Qu Huadao brought down his sword, completely overturning the void for hundreds of miles, as if countless sword qi were bombarding down, intending to utterly annihilate Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng casually held his hand behind his back, his right hand reaching out, fingers grasping the air.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after.</p><p></p><p>He clenched his palm forcefully.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The sword qi exploded, and a layer of blood mist burst out from Qu Huadao's body. His originally black robe was already dyed in fresh blood, appearing disheveled and unsightly.</p><p></p><p>"Puchi!"</p><p></p><p>Qu Huadao coughed out blood, and when he looked at Gu Qingfeng again, his eyes were no longer filled with arrogance and killing intent, but only endless terror.</p><p></p><p>"A... A Half-Saint!!"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, the Nine Provinces have long declined, how could there be a Half-Saint emerge!!"</p><p></p><p>Qu Huadao felt like he was going insane.</p><p></p><p>He originally thought he could easily subdue the cultivator, but the result was that he was facing a Half-Saint. Moreover, judging from the other party's techniques, this level of power might even be at the true peak among Half-Saints.</p><p></p><p>Half-Saint!</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qu Huadao's words, all the cultivators present were stunned.</p><p></p><p>They found it hard to believe that the ordinary Shenwu Dynasty could have a Half-Saint emerge.</p><p></p><p>But seeing Qu Huadao, the peak Dao Palace, being almost suppressed by Gu Qingfeng with just a single hand, such strength could only be possessed by a Half-Saint.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Many factions extinguished the thoughts of seizing the Great Saint inheritance.</p><p></p><p>After all, facing a Half-Saint in this era when Saints were scarce, this was truly a top-tier expert. To try and snatch the inheritance from such an existence was not that simple.</p><p></p><p>Right now.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not speak, but simply punched towards Qu Huadao. At his level of cultivation, even a simple punch contained terrifying might.</p><p></p><p>The horrifying power caused the Sect Master of Feather Transformation Holy Land's Sword Peak to change expression.</p><p></p><p>"You want to kill me-"</p><p></p><p>Qu Huadao never expected Gu Qingfeng to dare to strike to kill. After all, he was a peak master of the Feather Transformation Holy Land, a revered position.</p><p></p><p>Even if the person in front of him was a Half-Saint, the Feather Transformation Holy Land was not without Half-Saints of their own.</p><p></p><p>Moreover.</p><p></p><p>The Feather Transformation Holy Land had an inheritance of tens of thousands of years, with unfathomable foundations.</p><p></p><p>So for Gu Qingfeng to dare to strike to kill, it really surprised Qu Huadao.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>He was still an old-school expert. The moment Gu Qingfeng struck, Qu Huadao erupted with his full blood qi power, his divine sword and ancient weapons pressing down on the void, with solidified sword qi rumbling out.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!!"</p><p></p><p>The two forces collided, and the sword qi shattered before Qu Huadao's astonished gaze.</p><p></p><p>The lingering force caused him to vomit blood again.</p><p></p><p>"You cannot kill me... I am the Sect Master of the Sword Peak of the Feather Transformation Holy Land, if you kill me, the Feather Transformation Holy Land will never let you off!!"</p><p></p><p>Qu Huadao was truly afraid now. After all, how many in the world were not afraid of death, let alone at his level of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression remained indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"The Feather Transformation Holy Land? It's nothing. Anyone who dares to attack my Gu family will die!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Gu Qingfeng slashed down with his hand like a blade, and Qu Huadao's expression turned ferocious as he burned his blood qi, unleashing the strongest attack he had ever used.</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Qingfeng did not give him a chance to live, Qu Huadao naturally could not just sit and wait for death.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Ancient blade qi slashed through the heavens and earth, causing all the sword qi to dissipate. Qu Huadao's hovering figure paused slightly, then exploded.</p><p></p><p>"Boom-"</p><p></p><p>Flesh and blood scattered.</p><p></p><p>A peak Dao Palace expert had directly perished on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, all the cultivators fell silent.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Qingfeng's previous killings of Blood Cloud Elder and another Dao Palace expert had only shocked some cultivators, then his current suppression and slaying of Qu Huadao had completely intimidated everyone.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qu Huadao was no ordinary cultivator, but the Sect Master of the Sword Peak of the Feather Transformation Holy Land, a pinnacle expert who had reached the ninth layer of the Dao Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng slaying such a strong opponent meant his strength had already reached the Half-Saint realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it was Ji Meng's turn to fall silent.</p><p></p><p>This time, although the Three Thousand Divine Emperor's Army had lost nearly half of its forces, the remaining cultivators had all experienced different degrees of breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, the overall strength of the Divine Emperor's Army should have increased rather than decreased.</p><p></p><p>In Ji Meng's view, now that the Divine Emperor's Army had emerged, he should lead the army to annihilate Gu Qingfeng and destroy the Shenwu Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Sword Peak of the Feather Transformation Holy Land had fallen right before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This made Ji Meng somewhat hesitant.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Emperor's Army was indeed powerful, capable of surrounding and killing peak Dao Palace experts. But against a Half-Saint, the outcome was uncertain.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Half-Saint artifact he possessed was just a weapon of the past Half-Saints, and could not truly be compared to an actual Half-Saint.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a strong cultivator from the Shangguan Clan stepped out and coldly said, "Even if he is a Half-Saint, he cannot monopolize the Great Saint inheritance alone. In my opinion, you should bring out the Great Saint inheritance and let us all participate in its comprehension!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, Elder Shangguan Hongtian's words make sense. The Shenwu Dynasty wanting to monopolize the inheritance is rather tyrannical. In my view, it's better to share the inheritance!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Yu also spoke up.</p><p></p><p>With the Shangguan Clan taking the lead, and Ziyun Holy Land echoing it, the other hesitant cultivators also had their greed rekindled, and they all spoke up, wanting to jointly comprehend the Great Saint inheritance.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this situation, Shangguan Hongtian inwardly sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>This was the effect he wanted.</p><p></p><p>As a Saint Clan, Shangguan Hongtian naturally did not fear a Half-Saint. But with the many factions present, the Shangguan Clan could not face such a strong expert alone.</p><p></p><p>So he deliberately stirred up the emotions of everyone, to put pressure on the other party.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Qingfeng agreed, it would be the best outcome, and the Shangguan Clan could obtain the Great Saint inheritance. But if he refused, the matter would become much simpler.</p><p></p><p>With the strength of the experts present, killing a Half-Saint was not a big problem.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Shangguan Hongtian looked at Gu Qingfeng with a mocking gaze, wanting to see how the other party would respond.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the coercion of the crowd, Gu Qingfeng's eyes turned cold, and he directly punched towards one of the Dao Palace cultivators, ruthlessly blasting his body to pieces.</p><p></p><p>"Boom-"</p><p></p><p>Blood splattered.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators were unable to evade in time, their bodies splattered with fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>"This is my answer!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was ferocious, his eyes filled with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"Whoever wants the inheritance of the Great Saint, just step forward. As long as you kill me, the inheritance of the Great Saint will be yours. But if your strength is insufficient and you die at my hands, you have no one to blame but yourself!"</p><p></p><p>"Now!"</p><p></p><p>"I only want to kill you all, or be killed by you!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, the scene fell silent.</p><p></p><p>No one had expected the Mighty Imperial Dynasty's half-Saint to be so unyielding, unfazed even when facing numerous powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Shangguan Hongtiﾄ］'s eyes gleamed with fury as he roared, "So what if you are a half-Saint? In the end, you are still an ant before a Saint. Today, I, Shangguan, will see if your half-Saint status can withstand the Saint Armament of the Shangguan Clan!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Shangguan Hongtiﾄ］ opened the ancient casket on his back, and an ancient mirror flew out, emanating a powerful Saint aura that seemed to suppress the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>"The Blazing Sun Mirror!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the precious treasure once wielded by the Blazing Sun Saint. I never imagined the Shangguan Clan would bring this Saint Armament here!"</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators were shocked, their eyes filled with awe as they gazed at the ancient mirror in the void.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Gu Qingfeng's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>Although the Saint aura of the Blazing Sun Mirror was not as overwhelming as the pressure exerted by the Great Saint of the Heavenly Phoenix, it was still formidable.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Qingfeng heard Fu He's voice in his ear.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Gu, the Blazing Sun Mirror is the precious treasure once wielded by the Blazing Sun Saint of the Shangguan Clan. This Saint Armament has unfathomable power. More than ten thousand years ago, an ancient half-Saint dared to attack the Shangguan Clan, but was directly killed by the Blazing Sun Mirror. This treasure is not to be underestimated. Senior, you must be careful!"</p><p></p><p>This was a secret transmission.</p><p></p><p>Such techniques were easily mastered by ordinary Sect Masters, let alone cultivators at the Divine Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Gu Yang also summoned the Divine Phoenix Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>"Father, this is the treasure of the Great Saint of the Heavenly Phoenix. I am unable to fully unleash its true power, so please take it and use it!"</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Divine Phoenix Pagoda immediately attracted the attention of many powerful experts. This was a Saint Armament, an item that only cultivators at the Saint Realm could refine.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, not every Great Saint could possess a Saint Armament. Especially since the Great Saint of the Heavenly Phoenix was a top-tier Great Saint, rumored to be one step away from becoming a Saint King. Such a treasure was naturally coveted by many.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, Shangguan Hongtiﾄ］ would not allow Gu Qingfeng to control the Divine Phoenix Pagoda. He poured all his blood energy into the Blazing Sun Mirror, causing the Saint Armament to shine with an even more dazzling light.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, terrifying flames swept across the sky, engulfing Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>This attack was powerful enough to incinerate the void. The surrounding temperature had risen to a horrifying degree in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators hastily retreated, afraid of being affected by the power of the Saint Armament. Only Gu Qingfeng remained unfazed.</p><p></p><p>"To deal with a mere Saint Armament, there is no need to use a Great Saint Armament. You can rest assured."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was calm. He then extended his hand, and the Demon-Slaying Saber appeared in his grasp. The moment he grasped the hilt, Gu Qingfeng's aura underwent a drastic change. In the next instant, the long saber was drawn, and a blood-red blade light slashed through the heavens and earth, coalescing into a mighty Heavenly Saber.</p><p></p><p>"Slay!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng uttered a single word, and the Demon-Slaying Saber descended with tremendous force. At the moment of impact, the heavens and earth seemed to collapse, and the void was extinguished, as if everything had been reduced to nothingness.</p><p></p><p>The flames capable of incinerating the void were completely shattered by this strike.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying sword qi ruthlessly surged forward, and the Blazing Sun Mirror, sensing a great threat, released an ancient figure from within, its Saint aura suddenly surging.</p><p></p><p>The figure raised a finger, suppressing the remnant sword qi and completely neutralizing the attack.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing the appearance of the figure, Shangguan Hongtiﾄ］'s expression was a mix of surprise and joy.</p><p></p><p>"The Blazing Sun Saint!"</p><p></p><p>He was delighted that the power of the Blazing Sun Saint, left behind in the Blazing Sun Mirror, had been awakened. With the Saint's intervention, everything could be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>However, he was also worried that the Saint's power was not limitless. Once it was exhausted, the Blazing Sun Mirror would revert to being an ordinary Saint Armament, no longer possessing its former divine might.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even an ordinary Saint Armament was still exceptionally powerful. The problem was that the Saint's power was far superior to that of the Saint Armament.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the Saint's phantom appearing, all the cultivators were filled with reverence and awe. Even the peak Dao Palace Realm experts dared not entertain the thought of attacking.</p><p></p><p>On the side of the Mighty Imperial Dynasty, Fu He looked at the manifestation of the Blazing Sun Saint's power with a sense of despair.</p><p></p><p>"It's over! The power left behind by the Blazing Sun Saint has been activated. With the Saint's phantom appearing and a Saint Armament in hand, even a true Saint might not be able to defeat them!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang and the others were taken aback by Fu He's words.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan couldn't help but ask, "Master, what do you mean by that?"</p><p></p><p>"Simply put, the power of the Blazing Sun Saint has been unleashed, and with a Saint Armament at their disposal, they are now equivalent to a true Saint!"</p><p></p><p>Fu He took a deep breath and stated directly.</p><p></p><p>This was the foundation of a Saint Clan. Even in an era without Saints, they could still wield power comparable to a Saint by relying on their treasured artifacts.</p><p></p><p>Such a level of power would require the utmost caution even from the ancient Holy Land of Taixu.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Fu He's gaze towards Gu Qingfeng was tinged with regret.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful individual, who had reached the half-Saint Realm in this era, was undoubtedly destined to become a Saint in the future. But now, it seemed he would meet his demise here.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression was grim. "If I hand over the Divine Phoenix Pagoda to my father, would we be able to match this Blazing Sun Saint?"</p><p></p><p>"No!" Fu He shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Saint Armaments have their own sentience. Even Great Saint Armaments are the same. Only the one recognized by the Armament can truly unleash its full power. Senior Gu is not the chosen master of the Divine Phoenix Pagoda, so he would be unable to fully activate its might.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if you forcibly sever your connection with the Divine Phoenix Pagoda, you will suffer severe backlash."</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that your current cultivation is too weak. If you could reach the Divine Transformation Realm, perhaps you would have a chance to unleash a portion of the Great Saint Armament's power and suppress the Blazing Sun Mirror!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang clenched his fists, his face filled with frustration.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, he deeply felt the weakness of his own strength.</p><p></p><p>No matter how perfect his Grand Master cultivation was, in the face of true powerhouses, he was still but an ant.

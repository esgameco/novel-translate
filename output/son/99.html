        <h1>Chapter 99</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Above the ancient city.</p><p></p><p>The evil Buddha murmured.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng suddenly felt his blood and qi boiling, and an uncontrollable urge to give up resistance arose in his heart, wanting to walk to the blood lotus and serve the evil Buddha.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>The moment this thought arose.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's will was as sharp as a knife, directly severing that foreign thought.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The scene before his eyes changed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng found that he had somehow appeared inside the ancient city, and a terrifying and eerie cold aura permeated the air.</p><p></p><p>And behind him.</p><p></p><p>Was the city gate.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng directly retreated.</p><p></p><p>But just as he turned to leave, the eerie cold aura suddenly erupted, and a Buddha's palm pressed down from the void, as if blocking the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>The sun and moon lost their light.</p><p>The blood color spread.</p><p></p><p>The Demon-Slaying Sword trembled violently, but Gu Qingfeng's expression was calmer than ever before, as his physical body and qi exploded forth, like the rising of the mighty sun, the scorching heat evaporating the entire cold aura.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after.</p><p></p><p>The long sword was unsheathed.</p><p></p><p>The essence, energy, and spirit gathered together.</p><p></p><p>"Tyrannical Sword Slash!!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng roared, unleashing a tyrannical and unparalleled sword strike that could cleave mountains and split the earth, the dazzling sword light like the first ray of dawn, crashing heavily onto the Buddha's palm.</p><p></p><p>In the next breath.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>A terrifying force came crushing down.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's entire body was sent flying like a cannonball, but before he even hit the ground, he twisted his form in mid-air and struck another sword towards the outside of the ancient city.</p><p></p><p>The biting sword light seemed to be able to slice through space, and in the blink of an eye, Gu Qingfeng had escaped.</p><p></p><p>The entire process.</p><p>Happened in the span of a lightning strike.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Qingfeng's departure, in the bleeding eyes of the Buddha, a emotion called anger appeared for the first time, and a clear sword mark appeared on the golden palm, with fresh blood dripping from the wound.</p><p></p><p>But in less than a breath, the wound disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Outside the ancient city.</p><p>Gu Qingfeng retreated ten miles.</p><p></p><p>Then he stood still, forcibly circulating his blood and qi to expel the invading cold aura.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng let out a long breath, and the ground instantly froze, with all the plants and trees withering.</p><p></p><p>"The Calamity-Level Demonic Curse is indeed extraordinary. If I were to be completely trapped in it, I'm afraid I would be done for here!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the evil Buddha in the ancient city, and the Buddha also stared at him, their eyes locked, the latter's bleeding eyes filled with cruelty and murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>This was Gu Qingfeng's first encounter with a Calamity-Level Demonic Curse.</p><p></p><p>Its power made him feel immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>If it were a direct confrontation, he would definitely not be the Buddha's match.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Second Realm of Refining Impurities.</p><p></p><p>Even if he had broken through to the Fifth Realm or even the Patriarch realm, he might still not be able to defeat this evil Buddha.</p><p></p><p>Before witnessing the power of the Calamity-Level Demonic Curse, Gu Qingfeng had already imagined how formidable such a being would be, but now he truly understood what a Calamity-Level Demonic Curse meant.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Mountain City is doomed! No! To be precise.</p><p></p><p>The entire Nine Curved Path is doomed! The cultivators of the major sects and families have fallen into the tiger's mouth, all slaughtered and suppressed by the evil Buddha, their physical bodies becoming the Buddha's sustenance.</p><p></p><p>Just now...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The evil Buddha was able to devour other evil spirits, causing its own strength to grow even more powerful. In this way, it was able to expand the forbidden area, catching Gu Qingfeng off guard and causing him to inadvertently step into the forbidden zone.</p><p></p><p>It was only because Gu Qingfeng reacted quickly that he was able to escape.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Qingfeng's fear and wariness towards the evil Buddha had risen to an unprecedented level.</p><p></p><p>With the gradual growth of this evil spirit's strength, the forbidden area would undoubtedly continue to expand. Gu Qingfeng even suspected that if the evil Buddha was allowed to grow, it might even be possible for the forbidden area to swallow the entire Nine Curved Path.</p><p></p><p>To truly and absolutely eliminate an evil spirit of this level was no easy task.</p><p></p><p>"It's not just the evil spirit problemâ€”"</p><p></p><p>"Now the thousand-year-old ancestral sects like the Zhuo family have all suffered heavy losses, and there may be even greater upheaval to come!"</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the twisted bodies on the other blood lotuses, Gu Qingfeng's eyes became cold and indifferent.</p><p></p><p>He was fortunate that he had not truly participated in this battle.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the people among the blood lotuses might have increased by one more.</p><p></p><p>After taking a deep look at the evil Buddha hovering above the ancient city, Gu Qingfeng turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Against the power of this evil Buddha, he was currently not able to contend with it.</p><p></p><p>A half-step Sect Master! In the face of a truly powerful evil spirit, he was nothing more than an ant.</p><p></p><p>If such an evil spirit were to appear in the White Stone Path, the fate of the Gu Family Manor would be easy to imagine.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Gu Qingfeng considered moving the Gu Family Manor away from the White Stone Path, but this thought was quickly suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Moving away from the White Stone Path was easy. </p><p></p><p>But the problem was that the world was now in great turmoil, with strange and bizarre evil spirits emerging everywhere. Other places might not necessarily be any safer.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in an unfamiliar place, the complex web of forces would make it difficult for the Gu Family Manor to carve out a place for itself.</p><p></p><p>Compared to that, the White Stone Path was at least relatively safe now.</p><p></p><p>The evil Buddha existed within the Nine Curved Path and might not necessarily have the potential to affect the White Stone Path.</p><p></p><p>So leaving was not a possibility.</p><p></p><p>Unless it became truly impossible to remain, the foundation of the Gu Family Manor in the White Stone Path could not be abandoned.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng returned to the Gu Family Manor, three days had already passed.</p><p></p><p>During the days he was away, the Gu Family Manor had remained peaceful.</p><p></p><p>In the current White Stone Path, the Gu Family Manor was truly the supreme power, even more so than the imperial court and government offices.</p><p></p><p>The five words "Gu Qingfeng, the Tyrannical Saber" were enough to awe all the petty scoundrels.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng returned, Gu Yang was the first to come greet him.</p><p></p><p>"Father, have you made any discoveries upon returning from the Nine Curved Path?"</p><p></p><p>His expression was somewhat curious.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's face, however, was grave and solemn as he said in a deep voice, "The powerful experts of the ancestral sects in Guangyang Prefecture are essentially finished. The evil spirit in the Nine Curved Path is a calamity-level existence.</p><p></p><p>When I entered the Nine Curved Path, I saw an evil Buddha towering in the void, suppressing an entire city, and all the powerful experts of the ancestral sects had become its sustenance."</p><p></p><p>"I believe it won't be long before this news spreads throughout Guangyang Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>"Now that the world is in turmoil and the ancestral sects of Guangyang Prefecture have suffered heavy losses, it might even trigger other consequences."</p><p></p><p>"So in the coming period, you must keep an eye on the situation in the jianghu. If there are any sudden developments, you must inform me immediately."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's words made Gu Yang's expression turn grave as well, and he hurriedly nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>From just a few words, he could understand the terrifying nature of a calamity-level evil spirit.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 189</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by a Fusion Realm cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain the Fusion Realm cultivator with the Demon-Slaying Blade!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the Whetstone Hall, Gu Qingfeng glanced at the attribute panel, and when he saw the news of the Fusion Realm cultivator's attack, his eyes cooled slightly, then quickly returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Fusion Realm cultivator from the Tianyang Sword Sect, or some other force?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators at this level of strength are much rarer than Xiantian Grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>Any Fusion Realm cultivator, regardless of their identity, holds a position of great power.</p><p></p><p>Even within the Immortal Sects, this level of existence can be considered as part of the upper echelons.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when Gu Qingfeng received the news of a Fusion Realm cultivator's attack, the first thing he thought of was the Tianyang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>After all, apart from the Tianyang Sword Sect, he really couldn't think of anyone else who would use such a powerful expert to assassinate.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng didn't ponder for long.</p><p></p><p>As a guard entered and handed him the flying messenger's letter, all of Gu Qingfeng's doubts were resolved.</p><p></p><p>"The Commander of the Demon-Suppressing Bureau in Nanyang Prefecture, Nangong Yu!"</p><p></p><p>Regarding the existence of the Demon-Suppressing Bureau, Gu Qingfeng hadn't heard much about it for some time.</p><p></p><p>The Demon-Suppressing Bureau is an institution under the Taixuan Dynasty responsible for suppressing evil forces, with branches in every state and prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The Guangyang Prefecture previously had a Demon-Suppressing Bureau branch as well.</p><p></p><p>But since Gu Yang's uprising, the Demon-Suppressing Bureau in Guangyang Prefecture had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, the Demon-Suppressing Bureau in Guangyang Prefecture neither had the ability to deal with Gu Yang, nor the intention to side with him, so they withdrew to preserve their strength.</p><p></p><p>Later on, as Gu Yang annexed the entire Taishan Prefecture, all the Demon-Suppressing Bureau branches in the region seemed to have vanished into thin air, leaving no trace behind.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, as Gu Qingfeng's strength grew, he didn't pay much attention to the Demon-Suppressing Bureau.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Demon-Suppressing Bureau was just an institution of the Taixuan Dynasty, no matter how powerful it might be.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng, with his own strength, had the right to ignore the existence of the Demon-Suppressing Bureau.</p><p></p><p>Until now, when the flying messenger from Nanyang Prefecture arrived, Gu Qingfeng was reminded of the Demon-Suppressing Bureau again.</p><p></p><p>However, with Gu Yang's Demon-Slaying Blade to protect him, a mere Fusion Realm cultivator attempting to assassinate him would be courting their own destruction.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, the Demon-Slaying Blade that now bears Gu Qingfeng's power, in his eyes, could even slay a Nascent Soul cultivator, let alone a mere Fusion Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, Gu Qingfeng turned his attention to the other contents of the letter.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Gu Qingfeng's palm trembled, and he crushed the letter into powder.</p><p></p><p>Blood sacrifice of the common people.</p><p>The evil force sealed in the Blood Mountain Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>These pieces of information appeared, all of which made Gu Qingfeng's expression turn cold.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, the Tianyang Sword Sect is making a last-ditch effort.</p><p></p><p>Their reputation no longer matters, as they are trying to preserve the lineage of the Tianyang Sword Sect, which is why they are resorting to such desperate measures.</p><p></p><p>After all, even though the Immortal Sects require the life force and blood of the common people for cultivation, they rarely commit the act of massacring entire cities.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators view the common people as livestock to be harvested periodically, ensuring a continuous supply.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, if they were to kill everyone all at once, there would be no possibility of a steady, long-term supply.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The thought descended.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the dark guard in front of him and said indifferently, "Tell Yangzi that he can proceed as usual, there's no need to worry about the affairs of Blood Mountain Manor, I will personally resolve it!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>The dark guard took his leave as commanded.</p><p></p><p>Watching the retreating figure, Gu Qingfeng's eyes grew cold.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a while since I've been active. Now is a good time to visit Nanyang Prefecture, I want to see how the evil entity of Blood Mountain Manor compares to the evil Buddha of the Nine Twists Dao."</p><p></p><p>"Sacrificing the common people to awaken the evil entity, let's see if you have the chanceâ€”"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not consider himself a saint, but as a member of the human race, he could not sit idly by and watch the people be slaughtered by the evil entity.</p><p></p><p>If he was weak, it would be understandable.</p><p></p><p>After all, with limited strength, it's already difficult to preserve oneself, let alone save others.</p><p></p><p>But in this situation, Gu Qingfeng had to step in.</p><p></p><p>Looking at it another way.</p><p></p><p>Even if it wasn't for the sake of the people of Nanyang Prefecture, he had to consider Gu Yang's future.</p><p></p><p>After all, the other party aims to contend for the world, and Nanyang Prefecture, as the foremost of the four prefectures in Qingyun State, is of crucial importance.</p><p></p><p>If Nanyang Prefecture encounters problems, it would be detrimental to future developments.</p><p></p><p>For all these reasons, </p><p>Gu Qingfeng had no choice but to intervene.</p><p></p><p>Just as a messenger pigeon was leaving the Gu family manor, Gu Qingfeng also departed.</p><p></p><p>This time, </p><p>he did not make a grand display.</p><p></p><p>However, before leaving the Gu family manor, Gu Qingfeng had Gu Peng take charge of the manor's affairs, and also had Red Leaf and the others secretly guard the manor's safety.</p><p></p><p>Excluding Xu Yulan, the Gu family manor now had several Xiantian Grandmasters, so Gu Qingfeng was not worried about any problems arising.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family manor of today was no longer comparable to the past.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While Gu Qingfeng was leaving the Gu family manor and heading to Nanyang Prefecture,</p><p>on the other side,</p><p>the messenger pigeon had already arrived first.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the letter in his hand, Gu Yang's face broke into a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Good, father is willing to personally intervene, then the problem of Blood Mountain Manor is no longer a concern. From now on, we only need to focus on dealing with the Tianyang Sword Sect and the Pei family!"</p><p></p><p>After having the dark guard inform Gu Qingfeng about the affairs in Nanyang Prefecture, Gu Yang also had the intention of requesting his father's assistance.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p>at this moment, Gu Qingfeng's willingness to step in had finally put Gu Yang's heart at ease.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Cloud and the other generals, upon hearing Gu Yang's words, also showed expressions of delight.</p><p>They were well aware of who Gu Yang was referring to as "father".</p><p>If that person was willing to intervene, not only the Blood Mountain Manor, even ten Pei families and the Tianyang Sword Sect would not be a concern.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Cloud said, "Since Master Gu is willing to intervene, the problem of the evil entity in Blood Mountain Manor is no longer a concern. Now, Your Majesty, how do you plan to proceed?"</p><p></p><p>"The Pei family and the Tianyang Sword Sect have committed the heinous act of blood sacrifice and massacring the city, such an act that defies heaven and angers the people. These two forces have no reason to exist.</p><p>First, we will eliminate the Pei family and the Tianyang Sword Sect, and afterwards, the resistance in unifying Nanyang Prefecture will be greatly reduced."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression was ice-cold, and the murderous intent was not concealed at all.</p><p>These two families must be eliminated.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Gu Yang had planned to gradually encroach and then eliminate them later, to ensure absolute success.</p><p>But now, with the news of the blood sacrifice and city massacre, and Gu Qingfeng's personal intervention, Gu Yang no longer adopted this conservative approach.</p><p></p><p>Eliminate the two families.</p><p>Then turn around and deal with the other forces in Nanyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Ancient Cloud was slightly taken aback, but then he also understood Gu Yang's intention, and subsequently nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Whatever Your Majesty commands, the Divine Martial Sect will devote itself wholeheartedly!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 199</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This was the first step that Gu Qingfeng needed to take.</p><p></p><p>This martial arts technique was the foundation of the Gu Family Manor, and for the time being, it was more than sufficient.</p><p></p><p>Now that the world was unsettled, Gu Qingfeng would not widely disseminate this martial arts technique, for if others were to obtain it, it might not necessarily be a good thing.</p><p></p><p>However, if the entire world were to fall into Gu Yang's hands, then it would be different.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the Longevity Sutra would spread far and wide, and the reputation of the Gu Family would truly reach its peak.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had long planned these matters, but anything that was rushed would be impossible. It had to be taken one step at a time.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, Gu Qingfeng glanced at his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>With the breakthroughs of Gu Xuan and the others, the upgrade points in his possession had reached 91 points.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Gu Qingfeng immediately spent 50 upgrade points to advance his Pure Yang True Body to the minor success stage.</p><p></p><p>The moment the Pure Yang True Body entered the minor success stage, a flood of memories surged forth, and the refined qi and blood that Gu Qingfeng had previously cultivated became even more terrifying. At this level, a single drop could suppress evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the breakthrough of the Pure Yang True Body did not allow Gu Qingfeng to advance to the Extreme Dao Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was at peace with this.</p><p></p><p>"The Pure Yang True Body is indeed a Grandmaster-level supreme art, but for me, such an ordinary Grandmaster art has limited use. Each step of advancement in the Extreme Dao Grandmaster realm requires a deep enough accumulation."</p><p></p><p>"However, I must urge Gu Yang to hurry up a bit!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had never forgotten the idea of wanting Gu Yang to leave behind more descendants. Now that he had entered the Extreme Dao Grandmaster realm, the probability of him leaving behind offspring was even lower, so he must push Gu Yang and the others to make more efforts.</p><p></p><p>Only by having a sufficient Gu Family bloodline could the family truly be strengthened.</p><p></p><p>At present, Gu Yang had already broken through to the Refine Bone Realm. If he were to continue advancing, reaching the Wash Marrow Realm or even the Refine Viscera Realm, the probability of him leaving behind offspring would be even lower.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Gu Qingfeng looked at Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu, and he had some ideas about suppressing their realms, not allowing them to break through too quickly.</p><p></p><p>This was also an unavoidable matter. The stronger the cultivator, the lower the probability of them leaving behind offspring.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Qingfeng's view, this was a form of implicit balance. After all, the more powerful the martial artist, the greater the innate talent of their offspring.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Whetstone Hall, Gu Qingfeng began to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was fully immersed in comprehending the Unextinguished Dao of the Saber.</p><p></p><p>As Gu Qingfeng delved deeper into the profound mysteries of the Severed Finger, he would truly understand the terrifying nature of the Unextinguished Dao of the Saber. The Heavenly Saber he had created was undoubtedly the overlord among sabers, and the Heavenly Saber Dao it had given birth to was even more supreme than all living beings.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to the Unextinguished Dao of the Saber that remained in the Severed Finger, the Heavenly Saber Dao that Gu Qingfeng had cultivated was still lacking by more than one level.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, during this period of comprehension, Gu Qingfeng had not been completely without gains.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, the Heavenly Saber Dao, which was originally at the tenth level, had now advanced one step further, reaching the eleventh level of the Heavenly Saber Dao.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, this Grand Master-level martial art had also advanced to the Grand Master-middle stage.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Qingfeng's view, the true Dao Masters who had appeared in the jianghu were most likely only able to barely touch the tenth-level true Dao, reaching the threshold of the Grand Master-level true Dao.</p><p></p><p>After all, comprehending the true Dao of the Grand Master was extremely difficult. Without the Severed Finger, even if Gu Qingfeng had spent ten times or even a hundred times more time, he might still not have been able to successfully reach the eleventh-level true Dao.</p><p></p><p>This showed how difficult it was to cultivate the true Dao of the Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were no absolute rules in anything.</p><p></p><p>It was possible that there might be some exceptionally talented individuals who could comprehend even more powerful Grand Master-level true Dao.</p><p></p><p>But regardless, the appearance of the eleventh-level true Dao had allowed Gu Qingfeng's strength to advance further.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the time at Blood Mountain Mansion, he was now much stronger.</p><p></p><p>If he were to face the evil spirits of Blood Mountain Mansion again, Gu Qingfeng might not need to waste as much effort, and could suppress them within ten moves.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p><p></p><p>During Gu Qingfeng's half-month of seclusion, the Gu Family Manor had also undergone earth-shattering changes.</p><p></p><p>This change was brought about by the Longevity Sutra.</p><p></p><p>After the Gu Family's middle-level members obtained the Longevity Sutra, everyone was able to glimpse a portion of the mysteries of longevity.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Longevity Sutra was cultivated to perfection, it would only grant a lifespan of two thousand years, still far from the so-called true immortality.</p><p></p><p>But even so, it was enough to drive many people into a frenzy.</p><p></p><p>It was simple. Previously, cultivators at the Refine Viscera Realm could only live for about two hundred years, but now, with perfect Refine Viscera Realm cultivation, they could live for two thousand years, a tenfold increase in lifespan.</p><p></p><p>Such a change could be considered earth-shattering.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, by cultivating the Longevity Sutra and refining the perfect physical body, one's strength within the same realm could also be greatly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Completely crushing all other martial artists.</p><p></p><p>So when Gu Qingfeng passed down the Longevity Sutra, the loyalty of all the middle-level members of the Gu family soared to an unprecedented peak.</p><p></p><p>As for betrayal or leaking the Longevity Sutra, such things did not happen.</p><p></p><p>What a joke.</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family Manor had a peerless martial saint guarding it, and he had also bestowed such an earth-shattering opportunity. Unless one had a screw loose, they would not dare to commit such an act of betrayal.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>The problem of betrayal simply did not exist.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng also passed on the Longevity Sutra as Gu Qingfeng's legacy, making it the foundational martial art for the Gu Family Manor's outer disciples.</p><p></p><p>The current outer disciples have now expanded several times over.</p><p></p><p>Not counting the three thousand shadow guards, the orphans the Gu Family Manor has gathered from all over are no less than six or seven thousand.</p><p></p><p>If you include other people, the total number of outer disciples has already exceeded ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>These ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>They were all carefully selected by the Gu Family Manor, and their innate loyalty was impeccable.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the group of young men and women below, Gu Peng also felt a surge of heroic spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Just give me ten more years, and the Gu Family Manor's outer disciples will definitely shake the rivers and lakes!"</p><p></p><p>With ten thousand outer disciples, and the peerless Longevity Sutra as their foundation, in just ten years, or even less, the outer disciples will be able to produce a batch of powerful experts capable of shaking the rivers and lakes.</p><p></p><p>As the head of the outer disciples, Gu Peng naturally wished to witness this scene.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>Nanyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The former prefectural governor's mansion has now become the temporary Guangyang King's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at the items brought by the shadow guards, his expression filled with delight.</p><p></p><p>"The complete Longevity Sutra!"</p><p></p><p>He was currently cultivating the Longevity Sutra himself, but the original Longevity Sutra was incomplete, only reaching the Washing Marrow Realm. But now, the Longevity Sutra sent by Gu Qingfeng involved the complete cultivation method up to the Refining Viscera Realm.</p><p></p><p>Since becoming the Guangyang King, Gu Yang had received guidance from the experts of the Divine Martial Sect, and later even received personal instruction from a Grand Master of the Iron Sword Sect, so his martial arts knowledge was far beyond what it used to be.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>Just by glancing at the complete Longevity Sutra, Gu Yang understood the significance of this cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang summoned Gu Yi and handed the cultivation method over to him.</p><p></p><p>"This is the complete Longevity Sutra, you should make a copy and pass it on for all the shadow guards to cultivate."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!" Gu Yi responded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Then.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang paused for a moment, and then said, "Also, go to the Guangyang Manor and bring Lai Er back for me."</p><p></p><p>He realized that he had not seen Zhong Lai for a long time.</p><p></p><p>This time, Gu Qingfeng not only sent the Longevity Sutra, but also had the intention of letting him have more offspring. Gu Yang carefully considered this and felt that Gu Qingfeng's words made sense.</p><p></p><p>After all, he only had one heir so far, and in the future, when he established his rule over the Nine Provinces, such a vast legacy would need someone to inherit it.</p><p></p><p>Having more offspring is not a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>Moreover.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang also understood that the higher the cultivation, the lower the probability of being able to have offspring. By the time his cultivation advanced further, he might not even be able to have children.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Yi immediately left to carry out the order.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, Gu Yang also summoned Gu Yun.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty has summoned me, is there something you need?"</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that the higher a martial artist's cultivation, the lower the probability of being able to leave behind offspring. As the top sect, the Divine Martial Sect must have some corresponding secret methods, right?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang spoke somewhat evasively, but Gu Yun could not fail to understand the implication.</p><p></p><p>He then smiled and said, "As for such secret methods, the Divine Martial Sect does indeed have some. After all, as Your Majesty mentioned, the higher the martial artist's realm, the lower the probability of being able to leave behind offspring.</p><p></p><p>So the powerful experts of our Divine Martial Sect over the generations have also researched some secret methods. However, any secret method has its limitations. These secret methods can be effective for martial artists below the Sect Master realm, but for those at the Sect Master realm and above, it is a matter of fate and cannot be forced.</p><p></p><p>However, even though the secret methods are useless for Sect Masters, in fact, Sect Masters can also leave behind offspring, it's just that the probability is much lower than ordinary people."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun's words made Gu Yang's expression relax.</p><p></p><p>Useful for below Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>In his view, that was sufficient.</p><p></p><p>At this time.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Gu Yang to speak, Gu Yun said, "I will soon send someone to the Divine Martial Sect to bring what Your Majesty needs."</p><p></p><p>"Then I thank the Sect Master." Gu Yang expressed his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>Guangyang Manor.</p><p>Inside the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was still in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>However, a message from the shadow guards arrived, forcing him to temporarily interrupt his seclusion.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, a message has come from the Central Plains, the imperial army has suffered a major defeat against the various rebel kings, with over ten million troops now besieging the capital. Many Immortal Sects and powerful families have joined forces, trying to seize this opportunity to overthrow the Empress' imperial house.</p><p></p><p>At this critical juncture, the Empress' imperial house has brought out five Grand Sect Masters, who have used thunderous might to severely wound the various powerful experts, preserving the Empress' imperial lineage."</p><p></p><p>In the main hall, a shadow guard explorer reported solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this news, the previously calm expression on Gu Qingfeng's face underwent some changes.

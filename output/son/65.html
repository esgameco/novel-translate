        <h1>Chapter 65</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that the Patriarch of the Gu Family has recently destroyed the Qingyang Sect. Although the Zhujiang Sword Forging School has a long history, the inheritance has been lacking, and the martial artists of the Zhujiang Sword Forging School have all been stuck at the Blood Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>So I, Shi, would like to request the Patriarch of the Gu Family to allow our Zhujiang Sword Forging School to catch a glimpse of the profundities of the supreme martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Saying this,</p><p></p><p>Shi Kaisheng was afraid that Gu Qingfeng would misunderstand something, so he hurriedly explained.</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch of the Gu Family can rest assured, our Zhujiang Sword Forging School is willing to pay any price for this, the Patriarch of the Gu Family can just name it, and as long as our Zhujiang Sword Forging School can do it, I, Shi, will not hesitate at all!"</p><p></p><p>Supreme martial arts are too precious.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, the Zhujiang Sword Forging School has not lacked so-called genius martial artists.</p><p></p><p>But what of it?</p><p></p><p>The upper limit of martial arts is the predetermined upper limit of the martial artists.</p><p></p><p>If one can still have a chance to obtain the middle-grade martial arts, then the supreme martial arts are extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>With the heritage of the Zhujiang Sword Forging School, over the centuries, they have not been able to obtain any supreme martial arts.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p></p><p>Given the preciousness of such martial arts, even if the Zhujiang Sword Forging School exhausts its resources, it would still be difficult to get their hands on them.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly,</p><p></p><p>Even if the Zhujiang Sword Forging School really obtained the supreme martial arts, it is not certain that they could defend them.</p><p></p><p>This,</p><p></p><p>is the tragedy of an ordinary force.</p><p></p><p>After Shi Kaisheng's words fell, Gu Qingfeng slowly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"The importance of supreme martial arts, I believe the Patriarch of the Zhujiang Sword Forging School understands it better than I do. Such martial arts, when placed among many forces, can become the supreme secret art of the sect.</p><p></p><p>The Zhujiang Sword Forging School has forged divine weapons for my Gu Family, and I should be grateful, but as for the supreme martial arts, please forgive me, I cannot agree to it."</p><p></p><p>"This is my presumptuous request!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Kaisheng's face showed a disappointed expression, but he soon recovered.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's refusal was not unexpected in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>After all, the supreme martial arts are precious, and the other party's unwillingness to hand them over is understandable.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng then summoned someone to bring Gu Yang over.</p><p></p><p>"Greet your father!"</p><p></p><p>"Take the Patriarch of the Zhujiang Sect to the warehouse and pay the Zhujiang Sword Forging School ten thousand taels of silver as a reward."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, many thanks to the Patriarch of the Gu Family!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the reward of ten thousand taels of silver, Shi Kaisheng also forced a smile on his face, and then followed Gu Yang to leave.</p><p></p><p>Unable to obtain the supreme martial arts, an extra ten thousand taels of silver is not bad.</p><p></p><p>Watching Shi Kaisheng leave, Gu Qingfeng's expression was indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme martial arts... The Zhujiang Sword Forging School really dares to dream!"</p><p></p><p>The forging of the divine weapon itself was already a pre-arranged transaction, and now giving the Zhujiang Sword Forging School an additional ten thousand taels of silver as a reward can be considered the Gu Family doing their utmost.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's gaze returned to the sword in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The divine weapon has been forged.</p><p></p><p>Enough to add several parts to his strength.</p><p></p><p>"This sword shall be named Zhu Xie (Exterminate Evil)!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng gripped the hilt of the sword, and at the moment the aura was infused into the long sword, he vaguely felt a subtle resonance between himself and the divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>This kind of resonance seemed a bit mysterious, but it also seemed to truly exist.</p><p></p><p>Immediately,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng went to the backyard, intending to practice the Seven Killing Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Killing Sword Technique has seven moves:</p><p></p><p>Azure Dragon!</p><p>White Tiger!</p><p>Vermilion Bird!</p><p>Black Tortoise!</p><p>Breaking Army!</p><p>Greedy Wolf!</p><p>Seven Kills!</p><p></p><p>... The seven killing moves are fused into one, forming the Seven Killing Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng gripped the hilt of the sword, his entire expression became solemn, his eyes cold and indifferent, as if a bloody killing intent was surging forth.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The next breath.</p><p></p><p>The long saber was drawn from its sheath.</p><p></p><p>The icy saber light reflected in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The silver snake danced wildly!</p><p></p><p>The killing intent surged! In this moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was like a peerless killing deity descended upon the world, and the long saber in his hand was like a demonic weapon that slaughtered all under heaven, with the overwhelming killing intent sweeping across the four directions like a raging flood.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Yang arrived in the courtyard, he was instantly intimidated by this earth-shaking killing intent, his entire body feeling as cold as an ice cellar.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of martial arts is this!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression was horrified.</p><p></p><p>Even though they were separated by dozens of yards, the chilling saber light and the terrifying killing intent were still clearly perceptible, and the occasional leakage of saber qi even made Gu Yang feel a stinging sensation on his own skin.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in Gu Yang's eyes, it was as if a scene of mountains of corpses and seas of blood was unfolding, causing him to stand there dumbfounded, unable to move.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sheathed his saber, and Gu Yang finally truly regained his senses.</p><p></p><p>At this time,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang realized that his back was already soaked with sweat.</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang took a deep breath, barely suppressing the trembling in his heart, and then involuntarily asked,</p><p></p><p>"May I ask what martial arts Father just practiced? I have never seen it before!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the Seven Killing Saber Technique, a secret art of the military. If you wish to cultivate it, I can pass it on to you, but this martial art uses killing to attain the Dao, and is not something an ordinary person can cultivate."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not hide it, directly revealing the origin of this saber technique.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Killing Saber Technique! Gu Yang nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Although the incident of the Black Mysterious Guard being captured by the Gu family was kept secret, he was aware of it.</p><p></p><p>Evidently,</p><p></p><p>this Seven Killing Saber Technique was obtained from the other party.</p><p></p><p>Collecting his thoughts, Gu Yang did not dwell too much on this issue, and then said, "Father, the new address of the Gu family has been found, this is the deed given by the government.</p><p></p><p>This place was originally under the control of a force called Ming Ri Manor, but unfortunately, more than sixty years ago, Ming Ri Manor offended a powerful faction, and ultimately over three hundred and sixty people in the manor were massacred.</p><p></p><p>After that, Ming Ri Manor was completely abandoned, and later people were reluctant to take over the place, believing that place to be inauspicious!"</p><p></p><p>"So when we, the Gu family, wanted this place, the government barely charged us a hundred taels of silver, and just sold us that piece of land!"</p><p></p><p>A hundred taels of silver!</p><p></p><p>This price was not expensive at all.</p><p></p><p>As for the "inauspiciousness" mentioned by Gu Yang, Gu Qingfeng did not pay much attention to it.</p><p></p><p>"So-called inauspiciousness is just superstition. As long as one's strength is sufficient, why fear the inauspicious? Since you think that place is suitable, then just move there directly!"</p><p></p><p>"I have already prepared the craftsmen, and in less than half a month, the construction will be completed."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, just leave these matters to you to handle."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded.</p><p></p><p>Now, many affairs within the Gu family, he was too lazy to interfere with too much, and let Gu Yang handle them.</p><p></p><p>For Gu Qingfeng, nothing was more important than his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also gave a reminder.</p><p></p><p>"Other things are all external, only the strength of one's own body is the foundation of everything. Do not neglect your own cultivation. Here are a hundred Refining Blood Pills, I hope you will cultivate diligently and strive to enter the Refining Bone Realm as soon as possible!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang bowed his head and said.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>the other party left to handle the matters.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also brought the prepared Refining Blood Pills and gave them to him.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, many rewarding medicinal pills were useless to him. If he could help the other party's advancement, he would give them, otherwise, keeping them would just be a waste.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

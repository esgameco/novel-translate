        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The moment the Iron Body Technique was perfected, a flood of memories from cultivating the Iron Body Technique surfaced in Gu Qingfeng's mind. Then, he felt an itching sensation on his skin, and a layer of dead skin peeled off, revealing a bronze-colored skin.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng brought a weapon and struck his skin with full force, only a slight sensation was felt, and the skin was not penetrated at all.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, Gu Qingfeng activated the Iron Body Technique again and struck with full force.</p><p></p><p>When the blade touched his skin, it let out a metallic clanging sound, and in the next moment, the long blade was shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Gu Qingfeng's expression was delighted, as he had truly verified the power of the perfected Iron Body Technique. Now, relying solely on his physical body's defense, he could completely ignore the attacks of a Refined Skin expert. Whether he could withstand the attacks of a Refined Blood expert by fully activating the Iron Body Technique remained to be seen.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, the mastery of these two martial arts had given Gu Qingfeng the capital to dominate the Refined Skin realm.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, Gu Qingfeng took out the Refined Blood Pill.</p><p></p><p>The Refined Blood Pill was entirely scarlet, like freshly congealed blood. A strange aura emanated from it, and as soon as Gu Qingfeng took a whiff, he felt his qi and blood begin to boil.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Gu Qingfeng swallowed a Refined Blood Pill.</p><p></p><p>As the medicinal power entered his abdomen, it exploded with a force ten times greater than a regular Blood Refining Pill. His surging qi and blood were like a raging river, continuously washing over his flesh and skin.</p><p></p><p>Under such overwhelming medicinal power, Gu Qingfeng's entire body turned scarlet, like a cooked shrimp, until after a long time, the medicinal power gradually subsided, and his skin finally returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!" Gu Qingfeng let out a long breath. The effects of taking the Refined Blood Pill were more useful than a year of arduous cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Now, he could faintly sense the barrier of the Refined Skin realm.</p><p></p><p>Normally, to break through to the Refined Blood realm, one would need the corresponding martial arts. However, there were always exceptions, and the Refined Blood Pill was a shortcut for Refined Skin experts to break through to the Refined Blood realm.</p><p></p><p>However, with Gu Qingfeng's current cultivation, he could only take one of these pills per day; taking too many would harm his foundation.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Gu Qingfeng went to the Golden Bull Martial Arts Hall. He found the atmosphere in the hall to be somber, and before he could figure out what had happened, a disciple came to inform him that the hall master had something to discuss with him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not think much of it and went to the main hall, where he saw Xu Jun, whom he had not seen in a long time.</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Qingfeng had joined the Golden Bull Martial Arts Hall, he had only met Xu Jun a few times, as the latter was usually in seclusion, trying to break through to the Refined Blood realm.</p><p></p><p>However, when Gu Qingfeng looked at Xu Jun this time, he found that although the latter's aura was powerful, it did not exert much pressure on him, indicating that Xu Jun had not yet succeeded in his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jun also looked at Gu Qingfeng and, with a slight change in his expression, smiled and said, "Instructor Gu, it's been a while!"</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Hall Master," Gu Qingfeng replied with a cupped-fist salute.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jun then stood up and pointed to an empty seat next to him, saying, "Instructor Gu, since you're here, please have a seat. We'll discuss the matter once the other instructors arrive."</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Gu Qingfeng responded and took the seat.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Gu Qingfeng nodded and did not refuse, simply sitting down next to Xu Jun.</p><p></p><p>The other instructors who witnessed this scene had a strange look in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Among the many senior instructors, Gu Qingfeng was not the one with the longest seniority, and when facing other senior instructors, Xu Jun was not usually so enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>This sudden change made some people have other thoughts.</p><p></p><p>However, before the others could ponder too long, they saw Xu Jun say, "I didn't expect my Jinniu Martial Arts Hall to produce another master who has perfected the art of leather refining. I wonder how long has it been since Instructor Gu breakthrough to the level of perfecting leather refining?"</p><p></p><p>"It was just a lucky breakthrough a few months ago," Gu Qingfeng replied with a slight smile, casually fabricating a time.</p><p></p><p>Although his inner qi was concealed, he could not hide it from the eyes of a master like Xu Jun, so it was normal for his true state to be seen through.</p><p></p><p>"Perfecting leather refining!" </p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Xu Jun's words, the gazes of all the instructors towards Gu Qingfeng became different.</p><p></p><p>The previous doubts and jealousy had now turned into reverence.</p><p></p><p>Yes, reverence.</p><p></p><p>The way of the martial artist has always emphasized respecting the strong.</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Qingfeng had reached the level of perfecting leather refining, becoming one of the two masters in the Jinniu Martial Arts Hall, the rest did not dare to look down on him at all.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Instructor Gu!"</p><p>"It is truly joyous that our Jinniu Martial Arts Hall has produced another master who has perfected leather refining!"</p><p></p><p>The others all spoke words of congratulations, and Gu Qingfeng responded with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"You are all too kind."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After a long while, the remaining few instructors had all arrived.</p><p></p><p>The previously noisy hall had suddenly become much quieter.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jun's expression was solemn as he looked at the people present, and said in a grave voice, "I won't beat around the bush. Today, I received news that there is a strange blood mist appearing outside Lian County, and all those who enter the blood mist have perished in a bizarre manner.</p><p></p><p>These deceased people have been disemboweled, with their internal organs completely removed, exactly the same as the previous horrific incidents.</p><p></p><p>If I'm not mistaken, it seems that Lian County has been targeted by an evil entity!"</p><p></p><p>Evil entity!</p><p></p><p>When these words fell, everyone's expressions changed drastically, as if they had heard something unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's face also changed, and he immediately asked, "Master, what exactly is this evil entity that you speak of? Why has Gu never heard of it before?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Xu Jun bitterly smiled and said, "It's normal that Instructor Gu has never heard of the evil entity, because in places where the evil entity appears, there are rarely any survivors left.</p><p></p><p>I learned about the evil entity when I was young, by chance from someone's account.</p><p></p><p>It's not easy to explain the evil entity in a few words, but you all just need to know that it is an extremely terrifying existence. Wherever the evil entity appears, it can wipe out an entire city at the lightest, and even an entire prefecture could become a land of the dead."</p><p></p><p>"Take the previous incidents in Qingjiang Prefecture and Xuanshui City, where the outside world claimed it was an epidemic that caused all the civilians to perish. In reality, it was the disaster of the evil entity that wiped out the people of an entire prefecture and city.</p><p></p><p>The court fabricated the rumor of an epidemic to cover up the truth.</p><p></p><p>Now that a similar situation has occurred in Lian County, it is highly likely that the evil entity has set its sights on this place as well!"</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Xu Jun's face was filled with regret.</p><p></p><p>If he had known about the evil entity earlier, he would not have continued to stay in Lian County, but now it might be too late to do anything.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)"</p>

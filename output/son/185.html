        <h1>Chapter 185</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Pei family also received a message from the Tianyang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Pei Sheng looked at the letter in his hand, his expression unsettled, as if he was pondering something.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>One of the Pei family elders couldn't help but ask, "Family head, what exactly is the matter with the Tianyang Sword Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"You shall see," Pei Sheng casually passed the letter down.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the elders looked at the content on it, their expressions changing involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>After a moment,</p><p></p><p>Someone spoke up, "Sacrificing the common people of each city, how can such a method be carried out? If the news spreads, won't our Pei family be condemned for eternity!"</p><p></p><p>"The Second Elder's words are mistaken."</p><p></p><p>As the other spoke, an elder shook his head and refuted.</p><p></p><p>"Our Pei family has already allied with the Tianyang Sword Sect, and Pei Jing fell at the hands of that Guangyang King. Our Pei family and Gu Yang are already in a life-and-death struggle.</p><p></p><p>Now Gu Yang is leading the Guangyang army to invade Nanyang Prefecture, a million-strong army sweeping through unstoppably, almost impossible to contend with."</p><p></p><p>"If Gu Yang truly conquers the entire Nanyang Prefecture, does the Second Elder think our Pei family would still have any chance of survival?"</p><p></p><p>The speaker was the Pei family's Grand Elder, Pei Hong.</p><p></p><p>Within the Pei family, this Grand Elder's prestige was not low.</p><p></p><p>So when Pei Hong spoke, many people immediately nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, our Pei family has already been in a life-and-death struggle with the Gu family. How could Gu Yang spare us!"</p><p></p><p>"In the end, it's all the same as death, what do we have to fear about being condemned for eternity!"</p><p></p><p>"History is written by the victors. If we can defeat Gu Yang in this battle, then the specifics of how things turn out will be up to our Pei family to decide..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the other Pei family elders' words, the Second Elder Pei Lin's expression fluctuated.</p><p></p><p>He also knew that what they said was correct.</p><p></p><p>The Pei family and that Guangyang King Gu Yang were already in a life-and-death struggle.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Pei family wanted to back down, the other side probably wouldn't agree.</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p></p><p>This kind of approach of entrusting one's life to others was not something the Pei family's upper echelons could accept.</p><p></p><p>In the end,</p><p></p><p>All eyes fell on Pei Sheng, the family head.</p><p></p><p>As the family head and the current Nanyang Prefecture governor, his decision on how to proceed would be the final one.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go with the Tianyang Sword Sect's idea. Sacrificing a batch of commoners can bring a glimmer of hope to our Pei family. At least they will have died fittingly!"</p><p></p><p>Pei Sheng's expression was ice-cold as he made the decision directly.</p><p></p><p>If it had been in the past,</p><p></p><p>Pei Sheng might have considered the impact on his reputation and not acted so rashly.</p><p></p><p>But now,</p><p></p><p>The Pei family had no other choice.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' slaughtered 887 rebel soldiers!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' sent people to exterminate the Yin family, his reputation has improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' sent people to exterminate the Yueling Sect, his reputation has improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang's' Guangyang army conquered 36 cities in 10 days, his forces have greatly increased!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' luckily obtained the inheritance of a mysterious sect master, his strength has increased slightly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' attained enlightenment through slaughter, the Tyrannical Saber formally entered the door, comprehending the sixth-level Tyrannical Saber Dao, his strength has increased significantly!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Sixth-level Tyrannical Saber Dao!"</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect Yang'er to comprehend it so quickly!"</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng saw that Gu Yang had comprehended the sixth-level Tyrannical Saber Dao, his expression also slightly changed.</p><p></p><p>The difference between the fifth-level and sixth-level Dao was like the difference between ordinary Dao and Sect Master Dao.</p><p></p><p>Once one comprehended the Sect Master Dao, their strength could increase significantly.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Yang's current bone refining realm, with the Sect Master Dao, he could easily slay even Washing Marrow Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>This was the power of a Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Terrifying True Intent.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Gu Qingfeng did not expect Gu Yang to be able to comprehend the True Intent of the Grandmaster so quickly.</p><p></p><p>However, this also shows that the other party's perceptive abilities are truly remarkable.</p><p></p><p>As for the mysterious Sect inheritance...</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the information above, this seems to be the third or fourth inheritance that Gu Yang has obtained.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Yang'er is the legendary Heavenly Mandate Son?"</p><p></p><p>This thought involuntarily emerged in Gu Qingfeng's mind.</p><p></p><p>The concept of Auspicious Fate.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng had not truly witnessed it, he had heard of it.</p><p></p><p>Like the so-called Auspicious Fate Child, they can find opportunities wherever they go.</p><p></p><p>Just like Gu Yang, the other party has obtained many inheritances, including the Heaven's Pulse True Classic, which can be considered an invincible cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng could not help but suspect that Gu Yang might indeed be the legendary Heavenly Mandate Son.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng thought about it again and felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>"If he does not have the Heavenly Mandate, he would not be able to reach that position. Since Yang'er started the uprising from Guangyang Prefecture, if he can truly sweep across the Nine Provinces and sit on the imperial throne, it would be reasonable to say that he possesses a powerful Auspicious Fate."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was delighted to see such a situation.</p><p></p><p>The more opportunities Gu Yang can obtain, the better.</p><p></p><p>At least,</p><p></p><p>if he truly possesses Auspicious Fate, it means that even if he encounters dangers, he can turn them into opportunities and live much longer than others.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng glanced at the information panel again and continued to comprehend the martial arts.</p><p></p><p>After the Washing Marrow Chapter of the Longevity Sutra was derived, Gu Qingfeng was fully focused on deriving the Refining Viscera Chapter.</p><p></p><p>The Five Viscera as Deities!</p><p></p><p>To refine the Five Viscera to perfection, the difficulty is much greater than other realm cultivations.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng is already a person who has perfected his body, and he also possesses many top-tier supreme skills. Even if the Refining Viscera Realm is complex and profound, it is not a big problem for him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Nanyang Prefecture,</p><p></p><p>the armies were engaged in fierce combat.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang charged up the city wall, and his long saber slashed down with the force of splitting Mount Hua, the terrifying saber intent surging like towering waves, overwhelming a Washing Marrow Realm cultivator who was defending the city.</p><p></p><p>"No—"</p><p></p><p>The cultivator's expression was filled with terror, wanting to resist.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>under the dreadful suppression of that tyrannical saber intent, the cultivator's blood and qi were frozen, and his body could hardly move.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye,</p><p></p><p>the saber flashed.</p><p></p><p>By the time the long saber fell, the Washing Marrow Realm cultivator was completely bisected.</p><p></p><p>This scene,</p><p></p><p>when seen by the other cultivators, caused them to involuntarily suck in a cold breath.</p><p></p><p>"Sss!"</p><p></p><p>"Grandmaster's True Intent!"</p><p></p><p>"The talent of the King of Guangyang is truly terrifying—"</p><p></p><p>They had not forgotten that this King of Guangyang, although infamous, was still in his youth.</p><p></p><p>At such an age,</p><p></p><p>even if he only comprehended an ordinary True Intent, it would be enough to shock people.</p><p></p><p>Like Gu Yang, who directly comprehended the Grandmaster's True Intent, even if one were to go back thousands of years, the so-called geniuses and prodigies in the jianghu would not be able to compare to him.</p><p></p><p>Such perceptive abilities,</p><p></p><p>can only be described as defying the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Even the Patriarch of the Number One Sect in the world, Ancient Cloud, when he saw Gu Yang effortlessly kill a Washing Marrow Realm cultivator, his pupils dilated involuntarily, as if he had witnessed something unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>There's no help for it.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Grandmaster's True Intent is too shocking, Ancient Cloud could not help but be stunned.</p>

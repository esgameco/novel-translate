        <h1>Chapter 155</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Xuankong wanted to leave.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Er did not give the other party a chance to leave.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Killing Sword Technique was originally just a mid-level martial art, but now in Gu Er's hands, it displayed an unfathomable power. The true essence of killing cultivated from countless souls was unleashed, making Zhuo Xuankong feel as if he had fallen into an icy abyss, shivering with cold.</p><p></p><p>"True essence!"</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Xuankong's expression was one of shock.</p><p></p><p>This true essence power, although not at the level of a Patriarch's true essence, was still extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Gu Er himself was an innate Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>The combination of the two made Zhuo Xuankong sense the aura of death.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the long saber descending, Zhuo Xuankong unleashed his full power, his right palm striking out with a force like a surging river.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The long saber cleaved through the waves.</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Xuankong's full-powered palm was like a mere illusion before this strike.</p><p></p><p>In the moment the long saber came into view, Zhuo Xuankong was left dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Then, a bloody mark appeared on his brow, extending downwards.</p><p></p><p>The next instant, Zhuo Xuankong's body was split in two, the mighty Zhuo Clan patriarch meeting his demise.</p><p></p><p>From Gu Er's strike to Zhuo Xuankong's death, everything happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>With Zhuo Xuankong's death, Gu Er did not bother with the reviving evil, but stepped out, heading towards the other Zhuo Clan elders to kill.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As the undercurrents surged in Guangyang Prefecture, Gu Qingfeng, who was cultivating in the Whetstone Hall, looked at the information panel, where a large amount of text was refreshing, causing his expression to change slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Zhuo Clan! The Observation Star Sect! The Soul Bone Sect! These were the millennium-old powerful sects of Guangyang Prefecture, on par with the Crimson Flame Sect.</p><p></p><p>According to Gu Qingfeng's thoughts, these sects and families of cultivators had no need to exist.</p><p></p><p>However, while exterminating these millennium-old sects was easy, the subsequent impact would not be so easily eliminated, so Gu Qingfeng had turned a blind eye, allowing these powers to exist for the time being.</p><p></p><p>But now, Gu Yang had directly taken action and annihilated these powers.</p><p></p><p>This made things rather intriguing.</p><p></p><p>"Alyang must not have acted without reason, could there be some changes?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression shifted.</p><p></p><p>From the information panel, it seemed that Gu Yang had erupted in fierce conflict with the powerful sects of Guangyang Prefecture, and even he himself had been attacked by cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that the information panel recorded that Gu Yang had only been attacked by cultivators a few times.</p><p></p><p>Given the current situation, it meant that Gu Yang had truly torn off the masks with the other sects and families.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Peng's voice came from outside.</p><p></p><p>"The subordinate requests an audience with the Old Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Come in."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng spoke slowly, and then saw Gu Peng walk in.</p><p></p><p>The other party strode in three steps at a time, approaching Gu Qingfeng and bowing respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Old Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Speak, what is the matter?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Peng...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Peng, Gu Qingfeng was suspicious of the other party's arrival, and it should be related to the situation in Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>As expected.</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Qingfeng finished speaking, Gu Peng said, "Reporting to the old Patriarch, the Patriarch has just sent someone to deliver a message that the Sect Master of the Tianyang Sword Sect, Gu Yutian, has come out of seclusion and is leading the powerful members of the Tianyang Sword Sect towards Guangyang Prefecture. It is likely that they will arrive in a few days!"</p><p></p><p>"Gu Yutian!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng heard this name, and his expression changed slightly, but it soon became calm again.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Tianyang Sect.</p><p>Gu Yutian.</p><p>A Transformation Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>After slaying Pei Jing, Gu Qingfeng had already prepared to fight Gu Yutian.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately.</p><p>Gu Yutian had not made a move all this time.</p><p></p><p>Until now.</p><p>The other party has come out of seclusion and is heading towards Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>If it was before he broke through the Extreme Dao Sect Master realm, Gu Qingfeng would only have a 50% chance of defeating Gu Yutian, but after breaking through the Extreme Dao Sect Master realm, in his opinion, Gu Yutian no longer posed a threat to him.</p><p></p><p>As for now.</p><p>He has broken through the second layer of the Heavenly Vein True Classics, and his physical body has condensed two great Heavenly Veins.</p><p></p><p>To be honest.</p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not think that Gu Yutian would be his opponent, he was only worried that Gu Yutian might not be worthy of him going all out, to test the limits of his own strength.</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Gu Qingfeng's silence was seen by Gu Peng as fear of Gu Yutian, so he couldn't help but speak up.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that Gu Yutian is a powerful figure from a thousand years ago, and his strength is unfathomable. Your subordinate thinks there is no need to confront him head-on. If necessary, it would be better to temporarily avoid the spotlight, even if it means abandoning the current undertakings, which would not be unacceptable..."</p><p></p><p>"The problem of Gu Yutian, I will solve it myself. When I'm not here, you just take care of the affairs in the manor."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng directly interrupted Gu Peng's words.</p><p></p><p>Retreat?</p><p>That's impossible.</p><p></p><p>If it really couldn't be done, Gu Qingfeng naturally wouldn't force a confrontation.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p>Gu Qingfeng only wants to fight Gu Yutian.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the astonishment on Gu Peng's face, Gu Qingfeng walked out of the Whetstone Hall.</p><p></p><p>Just as he stepped out of the Whetstone Hall, the Zhu Xie Blade that had been quietly placed in the Whetstone Hall, as if responding to some kind of sensation, immediately flew out in front of Gu Peng's astonished gaze and fell into Gu Qingfeng's hand.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Whetstone Hall.</p><p>The sun was high in the sky.</p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked up at the scorching sun, a faint smile appearing on the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"After staying in the Whetstone Hall for so long, it's time to go out and take a walk. I just hope you won't disappoint me!"</p><p></p><p>Muttering to himself, Gu Qingfeng then slowly left the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Peng walked out of the Whetstone Hall, he happened to see Gu Qingfeng's figure standing in front of the Whetstone Hall.</p><p></p><p>But before Gu Peng could say anything, he saw Gu Qingfeng's figure suddenly dissipate like a mirage.</p><p></p><p>This scene.</p><p>Once again caused Gu Peng's pupils to suddenly contract, his face full of shock.</p><p></p><p>"Afterimage!"</p><p></p><p>"The old Patriarch's strength is truly unfathomable."</p><p></p><p>Only by moving fast enough can one leave a faint afterimage behind. Gu Qingfeng's ability to leave an almost indistinguishable afterimage was enough to show how terrifying his strength was.</p><p></p><p>"Such a technique, even that Tianyang Sect Master may not be able to do it!"</p><p></p><p>"The battle between the old Patriarch and Gu Yutian will surely shake the heavens and the earth, but unfortunately I will not have the chance to witness it!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>This level of powerful expert battle was not something he could interfere with.</p><p>Moreover, Gu Qingfeng had given orders before leaving, and Gu Peng naturally obeyed.</p><p>Otherwise, if there were any problems with the Gu Family Manor, he would have to bear the consequences.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

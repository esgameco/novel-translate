        <h1>Chapter 73</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This was the true purpose of Zhuo Feng's visit.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the other party meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>"As far as Gu understands, your family has always looked down on martial artists. If the Zhuo family wants to take control of the Taishan Dao, why bother asking for Gu's opinion?"</p><p></p><p>"It's true that there were voices within the Zhuo family advocating for directly taking control of the Taishan Dao, and even suggestions to annihilate the Gu family manor. But these proposals were all rejected by me, Zhuo."</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Feng did not hide anything.</p><p></p><p>"If the Gu family manor was just an ordinary force, it would have already fallen by now. But the fact that a deputy commander of the Zhenxie Mansion came to the Gu family manor and then simply left without taking any action against it shows that the strength of the lord of the Gu manor is certainly not as simple as the rumors suggest."</p><p></p><p>"For a martial artist of unknown strength, the Zhuo family does not want to get into a direct confrontation. Although the Taishan Dao is good, with the Zhuo family's foundation, whether we have one more or one less Taishan Dao makes little difference."</p><p></p><p>"So, if the lord of the Gu manor has the intention to take control of the Taishan Dao, then the Zhuo family will step aside. But still, there are many forces eyeing the Taishan Dao. Even if the Zhuo family doesn't make a move, other sects and families may not just sit idly by."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, I, Zhuo, think that instead of the Gu manor taking control of the Taishan Dao, it would be better to let the Zhuo family have it. Even if the Zhuo family has to pay a certain price for it, it would be no problem."</p><p></p><p>The conversation had reached this point.</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Feng was now waiting for the other party's response.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall, it was silent.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered for a moment before speaking.</p><p></p><p>"What price is the Zhuo family willing to pay?"</p><p></p><p>"No matter if it's heavenly treasures, earthly wonders, or peerless martial arts, as long as the lord of the Gu manor speaks up, as long as the Zhuo family has it, there will be no problem.</p><p></p><p>Even the secret techniques of refining evil, the Zhuo family can provide the lord of the Gu manor with one!"</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Zhuo Feng's face.</p><p></p><p>Because he understood.</p><p></p><p>His words had taken effect.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise,</p><p></p><p>This person would not have easily agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Does the Zhuo family have the secret techniques of refining evil?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course we do."</p><p></p><p>"And does the Zhuo family have any grandmaster's ultimate techniques?"</p><p></p><p>"Grandmaster's ultimate techniques are rare, but the Zhuo family once obtained a true meaning diagram left behind by a grandmaster. It is rumored that the powerful expert who left this true meaning diagram was on the verge of breaking through to the realm of great grandmaster."</p><p></p><p>"This true meaning diagram contains a fragment of the essence of the martial dao, but as for the specifics, I, Zhuo, also do not know.</p><p></p><p>After all, until now, no one in the Zhuo family has been able to comprehend the so-called essence of the martial dao!"</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Feng shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Qingfeng immediately said, "The Gu family manor can let go of the Taishan Dao, but I need three secret techniques involving the fifth realm of refining evil, as well as the grandmaster's true meaning diagram you mentioned!"</p><p></p><p>"Secret techniques involving the fifth realm of refining evil are extremely rare, and I, Zhuo, can give you one such secret technique, as well as one secret technique involving the fourth realm of refining evil.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, it will be the grandmaster's true meaning diagram that the lord of the Gu manor mentioned!"</p><p></p><p>"Good—"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded.</p><p></p><p>Seeing him agree so readily, Zhuo Feng was also in a good mood and continued with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"The lord of the Gu manor is quick-witted, but I still need to remind you that the martial dao has its limits. Throughout the years, those who have been able to break through to the grandmaster realm can be counted on one's fingers, and as for the realm above, the great grandmaster, they are even rarer.</p><p></p><p>In this world, only the sorcerers are on the great dao.</p><p></p><p>If the lord of the Gu manor has any thoughts in the future, you can come to our Zhuo family to seek the secret techniques of refining evil.</p><p></p><p>At least by joining our Zhuo family, it would be much freer than joining the Zhenxie Mansion."</p><p></p><p>"We'll talk about the future when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Feng said, "Alright, then we'll talk about the future when the time comes. The things the lord of the Gu manor needs..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"To the west, someone from the Zhuo family will send it over within five days. With that, I shall take my leave first."</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>—</p><p></p><p>Leaving the Gu family manor.</p><p></p><p>The smile on Zhuo Feng's face disappeared. Beside him, another middle-aged man had appeared, seemingly out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>"Shall we make a move on the Gu family manor?"</p><p></p><p>The man asked.</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Feng shook his head slightly: "Since the Gu family is willing to cooperate, there's no need to tear off the facade. The people of the Zhenxie Sect are not as simple as you think.</p><p></p><p>From the previous conversation, we can understand that the Gu family has not joined the Zhenxie Sect. </p><p></p><p>The purpose of Jiang Qin's previous visit here must have been to rally the Gu family, but after being rejected, he did not show any anger, which shows that the Gu family is not to be taken lightly."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover—"</p><p></p><p>"I just met Gu Qingfeng, and this person has an extremely robust vital energy, which even ordinary Xunwu Realm cultivators may not possess. </p><p></p><p>I even suspect that he has already stepped into the Lianzu Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful figure, akin to a minor sect master, if we from the Zhuo family can avoid provoking him, then so be it. The so-called supreme martial arts of the jianghu are nothing extraordinary to our Zhuo family.</p><p></p><p>If he wants them, then let him have them.</p><p></p><p>Exchanging a few martial arts secrets for a legitimate opportunity to enter the Taishan Dao, it's not a bad deal at all!"</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Feng smiled calmly, as if everything was under his control.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man's expression was worried: "The fear is that even if the Gu family is willing to compromise, other forces will not allow the Zhuo family to dominate the Taishan Dao."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, if they are unwilling, then we'll just have to fight it out." </p><p></p><p>Zhuo Feng sneered disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>What he wanted was just a pretext to dominate the Taishan Dao, at least the Zhuo family could then claim the moral high ground.</p><p></p><p>Without the true strength to overwhelm everything, whether one occupies the moral high ground or not is also crucial.</p><p></p><p>And then.</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Feng had another purpose, and that was to get on good terms with Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>A figure who is suspected to be a minor sect master at such a young age, when he truly reaches the Sect Master Realm in the future, it would not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Although cultivators are considered lowly, a Sect Master-level existence is not to be underestimated in the entire jianghu.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful figure is capable of suppressing many Yuling Realm sorcerers.</p><p></p><p>If the Zhuo family can recruit such a Sect Master to join them, the benefits would be considerable. If this powerful figure were to refine demonic arts in the future, he would undoubtedly become a formidable sorcerer.</p><p></p><p>The Zhuo family, as a thousand-year-old clan, has also encountered great calamities in the past, and its ability to pass down to the present day relies on maintaining good relations with various powerful figures.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>Dominating the Taishan Dao is one goal, and getting on good terms with Gu Qingfeng is another.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>If Gu Qingfeng is just an ordinary Xunwu Realm cultivator, then it would be a different story.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the day,</p><p></p><p>This jianghu still speaks the language of strength.</p><p></p><p>—</p><p></p><p>It was said to be a five-day timeframe.</p><p></p><p>In reality, the Zhuo family had already sent the items over by the fourth day.</p><p></p><p>Two supreme demonic cultivation techniques.</p><p>A Sect Master's true intent diagram.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the Zhuo family's speed, Gu Qingfeng was quite satisfied.</p><p></p><p>To him,</p><p></p><p>The Taishan Dao was not important.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary,</p><p></p><p>High-level martial arts were the key.</p><p></p><p>As long as his strength is sufficient, even if he were to abandon one Taishan Dao, Gu Qingfeng would have the confidence to seize a second or third one.</p><p></p><p>If the strength is not enough, then it would all be just empty talk.</p><p></p><p>"These two supreme demonic cultivation techniques, at least before breaking through the Sect Master Realm, I will no longer be lacking in the martial arts aspect!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

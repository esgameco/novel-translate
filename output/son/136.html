            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Pacify the entire Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Qingfeng was about to speak, the information panel refreshed again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has defeated the 100,000-strong Divine Martial Army, achieving the feat of 'Latent Dragon Emerging from the Abyss' (can only be triggered once)!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +300 Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 100 Ascension Elixirs (Marrow Cleansing)!"  </p><p></p><p>"Reward: 10 Ascension Elixirs (Organ Refining)!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 3 Ascension Elixirs (Grandmaster)!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 3 Grandmaster-realm Vanguards!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Three hundred Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's pupils constricted slightly.</p><p></p><p>He had considered the possibility of Gu Yang defeating the Divine Martial Army and achieving a feat, but when he actually saw the feat information, Gu Qingfeng couldn't help but be inwardly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Three hundred Cultivation Points.</p><p></p><p>For Gu Qingfeng's current situation, this was the solution to his pressing needs.</p><p></p><p>He was already just a step away from perfecting his Organ Refining, and now with three hundred Cultivation Points in hand, not only would perfecting Organ Refining be no problem, even breaking through to the Grandmaster realm would be feasible.</p><p></p><p>And then after that.</p><p></p><p>There were the Ascension Elixirs.</p><p></p><p>This was the second time Gu Qingfeng had obtained Ascension Elixirs.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>The quality of these Ascension Elixirs was far superior to the previous ones.</p><p></p><p>The starting point was Marrow Cleansing realm, with the highest being the Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>In other words.</p><p></p><p>This batch of Ascension Elixirs could instantly create one hundred Marrow Cleansing realm warriors, ten Organ Refining realm warriors, and three Grandmaster realm warriors for the Gu Family Village.</p><p></p><p>An even more important point is that.</p><p></p><p>The Ascension Elixirs represent the perfect level of breakthrough to the current realm.</p><p></p><p>This being the case.</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family Village not only has three Grandmasters, but three Grandmasters who have reached the pinnacle of the Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>And â€”</p><p></p><p>Three Grandmaster-realm Vanguards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was no stranger to the existence of Vanguards, as he had used them quite skillfully in the past.</p><p></p><p>Now.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of three Grandmaster-realm Vanguards is just right.</p><p></p><p>After all.</p><p></p><p>The biggest problem facing the Gu Family Village right now is the lack of true top-tier powerhouses to anchor them.</p><p></p><p>Although they have Gu Yi, who has reached the pinnacle of the Organ Refining realm, when it comes to the war for dominance of the world, a small Grandmaster is naturally not enough.</p><p></p><p>Just like this time.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of three peak Fusion Spirit realm experts from the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Any one of them could easily slay an Organ Refining realm warrior.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng could not always be by Gu Yang's side to protect him, and as he is exposed to the sight of various forces in the world, he is bound to face layer upon layer of dangers.</p><p></p><p>Now with several Grandmasters under his command, it would be a different story.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Gu Qingfeng looked at Gu Yang and nodded, saying, "Since you have ideas, then do as you wish, your father will always be your backbone.</p><p></p><p>As for the sects of Guangyang Prefecture, as you said, as long as I am here, they cannot stir up any waves.</p><p></p><p>If these sect forces are sensible, I will let them continue their legacy.</p><p></p><p>But if they are not sensible, then we shall just destroy them!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's face was filled with murderous intent by the end.</p><p></p><p>If it had been in the past, Gu Qingfeng might not have had the confidence to say those words.</p><p></p><p>After all, destroying the sects of Guangyang Prefecture was easy, but it would inevitably make the Gu Family Village a target of many.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>After the battle at the Northern Gate Pass, Gu Qingfeng had a clear understanding of his own strength. Now, although he had not yet reached the Great Grandmaster realm, his strength was enough to rival a typical Great Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>A Great Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Would be enough to pacify many upheavals.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Gu Qingfeng had just obtained three hundred more Cultivation Points, and if he were to successfully perfect his Qi Refinement, his strength would surely soar to new heights.</p><p></p><p>At that time.</p><p></p><p>Even Transcendent Realm Magi would have to step forward,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They can be directly suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Overlooking the world, there are not many Alchemist Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Before he knew it, Gu Qingfeng realized that he now has the qualifications to truly stand at the top of the world.</p><p></p><p>So Gu Qingfeng had the confidence to say such words.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Yang's expression became greatly invigorated.</p><p></p><p>By the time Gu Yang left to handle the aftermath, Gu Qingfeng had already directly taken all the rewards.</p><p></p><p>First, there were the three Grandmaster-realm elite guards.</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Gu Qingfeng, the three elite guards appeared before him. Two men and one woman, all emanating a powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Esteemed One!" The three knelt on one knee and clasped their fists.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's gaze fell upon the three elite guards, his expression growing increasingly satisfied.</p><p></p><p>These three elite guards were all powerhouses at the peak of the Grandmaster realm. </p><p></p><p>If the three Ascension Elixirs were factored in, it would be equivalent to six peak Grandmaster realm experts.</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, you shall be named Redleaf, Soulsnatcher, and Soulhunter, and serve my Gu Clan Manor," Gu Qingfeng spoke.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the three immediately accepted the order.</p><p></p><p>"We will faithfully carry out the Esteemed One's command!"</p><p></p><p>"Your powers are not to be revealed without my permission. Go outside and stand guard, do not let anyone disturb me!"</p><p></p><p>After the three left, Gu Qingfeng turned his attention back to himself.</p><p></p><p>Three hundred Advancement Points, enough to change many things.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Gu Qingfeng immediately used some of the Advancement Points to further cultivate the Prajna Sutra.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Consuming twenty Advancement Points, the Prajna Sutra broke through to the eighth layer! Consuming another twenty Advancement Points, the Prajna Sutra broke through to the ninth layer!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Gu Qingfeng had elevated the Prajna Sutra to the ninth layer. </p><p></p><p>As the martial arts cultivation breakthrough occurred, Gu Qingfeng's body underwent a terrifying transformation. His internal organs were refined to a state of perfect completion, and his blood and qi underwent earth-shattering changes.</p><p></p><p>The blood that originally flowed through his veins was now tinged with a faint golden color, but at this moment, the golden hue had become much more pronounced.</p><p></p><p>His blood had undergone a metamorphosis, and Gu Qingfeng's entire being seemed to have been elevated.</p><p></p><p>But this was not the end.</p><p></p><p>At the moment of perfect body refinement, Gu Qingfeng's surging blood and qi broke through the constraints of the Heavenly Cycle, and a mighty, sun-like blood energy force emanated from him.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Qi Grandmaster!" </p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect this realm breakthrough to be much easier than I had anticipated!"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, it was the Blood Qi Grandmaster realm. </p><p></p><p>At the moment of perfect internal organ refinement, Gu Qingfeng's overwhelming blood and qi underwent a transformation, directly breaking through to the Blood Qi Grandmaster realm - a natural progression.</p><p></p><p>Everything unfolded so smoothly, without any obstacles or surprises.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had anticipated this, for his blood energy force was already far superior to that of a typical Blood Qi Grandmaster. With his physical body undergoing further refinement, his advancement to the Blood Qi Grandmaster realm was almost a foregone conclusion.</p><p></p><p>Now, having broken through to the Grandmaster realm, Gu Qingfeng felt his strength had grown even greater.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

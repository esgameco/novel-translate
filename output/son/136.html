        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Quell the entire Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Qingfeng was about to speak, the information panel refreshed again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has defeated the 100,000-strong Divine Martial Army, achieving the feat of 'Emerging Dragon from the Abyss' (can only be triggered once)!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 300 Promotion Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 100 Ascension Elixirs (Marrow Cleansing)!"  </p><p></p><p>"Reward: 10 Ascension Elixirs (Purification of Impurities)!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 3 Ascension Elixirs (Grandmaster)!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 3 Grandmaster-realm Vanguards!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Three hundred Promotion Points!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's pupils contracted slightly.</p><p></p><p>He had anticipated that Gu Yang might achieve a feat by defeating the Divine Martial Army, but when he actually saw the feat information, Gu Qingfeng couldn't help but be inwardly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Three hundred Promotion Points.</p><p></p><p>For Gu Qingfeng's current situation, this was the solution to his pressing needs.</p><p></p><p>He was already just a step away from perfecting the Purification of Impurities, and now with three hundred Promotion Points in hand, not only would perfecting the Purification of Impurities be no problem, even breaking through to the Grandmaster realm would be feasible.</p><p></p><p>And then after that,</p><p></p><p>would be the Ascension Elixirs.</p><p></p><p>This was the second time Gu Qingfeng had obtained Ascension Elixirs.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>the quality of these Ascension Elixirs was not just one level higher than before.</p><p></p><p>Starting from the Marrow Cleansing realm, they could even reach the Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>In other words,</p><p></p><p>this batch of Ascension Elixirs could instantly create a hundred Marrow Cleansing realm warriors, ten Purification of Impurities realm warriors, and three Grandmaster realm warriors for the Gu Family Village.</p><p></p><p>An even more important point is that,</p><p></p><p>the Ascension Elixirs represent the perfect level of breakthrough to the current realm.</p><p></p><p>In this way,</p><p></p><p>the Gu Family Village not only has three Grandmasters, but three Grandmasters who have reached the pinnacle of the Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>And -</p><p></p><p>three Grandmaster-realm Vanguards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was no stranger to the existence of Vanguards, as he had used them quite skillfully in the past when protecting the Assassin.</p><p></p><p>Now,</p><p></p><p>the appearance of three Grandmaster-realm Vanguards is just right.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p></p><p>the biggest problem facing the Gu Family Village right now is the lack of truly top-tier powerhouses to anchor them.</p><p></p><p>Although they have Gu Yi, a Purification of Impurities realm expert, following them, when it comes to the war for domination of the world, a small Grandmaster-realm master is naturally not enough.</p><p></p><p>Just like this time,</p><p></p><p>the three Peak Fusion Spirit realm experts from the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect appeared.</p><p></p><p>Any one of them could easily slay a Purification of Impurities realm warrior.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng could not always be by Gu Yang's side to protect him, and as he is exposed to the sight of various forces in the world, he is bound to face layer upon layer of dangers.</p><p></p><p>Now that he has several Grandmasters at his disposal, it will be different.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Gu Qingfeng looked at Gu Yang and nodded, saying, "Since you have ideas, then do as you wish, your father will always be your backing.</p><p></p><p>As for the sects of Guangyang Prefecture, as you said, with me here, they will not be able to stir up any waves.</p><p></p><p>If these sect forces are sensible, then I will let them continue their legacy.</p><p></p><p>But if they are not sensible, then just destroy them!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's face was filled with murderous intent as he said the last sentence.</p><p></p><p>If it had been in the past, Gu Qingfeng might not have had the confidence to say this.</p><p></p><p>After all, it's easy to destroy the sects of Guangyang Prefecture, but it would inevitably make the Gu Family Village the target of many.</p><p></p><p>But now,</p><p></p><p>after the battle at the Northern Gate Pass, Gu Qingfeng has a clear understanding of his own strength. Although he has not yet reached the Great Grandmaster realm, in terms of strength, he is already on par with ordinary Great Grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>A Great Grandmaster,</p><p></p><p>would be enough to quell many upheavals.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Gu Qingfeng has now obtained three hundred Promotion Points again. If he succeeds in perfecting his Refinement of the Body, his strength will surely soar to new heights.</p><p></p><p>At that time,</p><p></p><p>even Nascent Soul Sorcerers would not dare to make a move.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They could be directly suppressed. </p><p></p><p>Looking at the world, there were not many Alchemist Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, Gu Qingfeng discovered that he now had the true qualifications to stand at the apex of the world.</p><p></p><p>So Gu Qingfeng had the confidence to say such words.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Yang heard this, his expression was also greatly elated.</p><p></p><p>By the time Gu Yang left to handle the aftermath, Gu Qingfeng had already directly taken all the rewards.</p><p></p><p>First, there were three Patriarch Realm death guards.</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Gu Qingfeng, the three death guards appeared before him. Two men and one woman, all emanating a powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>"Pay respects to the esteemed one!" The three kneeled on one knee and cupped their fists.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's gaze fell upon the three death guards, his expression growing increasingly satisfied.</p><p></p><p>These three were all powerful experts at the peak of the Patriarch Realm. </p><p></p><p>If the three Ascension Elixirs were factored in, it would be equivalent to six peak Patriarch Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, you shall be named Redleaf, Soulsnatch, and Soulhunt, and serve my Gu Clan Manor!" Gu Qingfeng spoke.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the three immediately accepted the order.</p><p></p><p>"We shall faithfully obey the esteemed one's command!"</p><p></p><p>"Your powers are not to be revealed without my permission. Go outside and guard, do not let anyone disturb me!"</p><p></p><p>After the three left, Gu Qingfeng turned his attention back to himself.</p><p></p><p>Three hundred Advancement Points, enough to change many things.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Gu Qingfeng immediately used some of the Advancement Points to further cultivate the Prajna Sutra.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Consuming twenty Advancement Points, the Prajna Sutra broke through to the eighth layer! Consuming another twenty Advancement Points, it broke through to the ninth layer!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Gu Qingfeng had elevated the Prajna Sutra to the ninth layer. </p><p></p><p>As the martial art cultivation advanced and broke through, Gu Qingfeng's body underwent a terrifying transformation. His internal organs were refined to a state of perfect completion, and his blood and qi underwent earth-shattering changes.</p><p></p><p>The blood that originally flowed through him was only lightly tinged with a faint golden color, but now the golden hue had become much more pronounced.</p><p></p><p>His blood had undergone a metamorphosis, and Gu Qingfeng's entire being seemed to have been sublimated.</p><p></p><p>But this was not the end.</p><p></p><p>At the moment of perfect body refinement, Gu Qingfeng's surging blood and qi broke through the constraints of the Heavenly Circuits, and a majestic power comparable to the sun radiated outwards from him.</p><p></p><p>Blood and qi like the divine sun, brilliantly illuminating the void!</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Gu Qingfeng opened his eyes, his expression now utterly calm.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Qi Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect this realm breakthrough to be much easier than I had anticipated!"</p><p></p><p>Yes, he had reached the Blood Qi Patriarch Realm. </p><p></p><p>At the moment of perfect internal refinement, Gu Qingfeng's overwhelming blood and qi had directly undergone a transformation, breaking through to the Blood Qi Patriarch Realm - a natural and smooth progression.</p><p></p><p>Everything had unfolded so logically, without any twists or surprises.</p><p></p><p>This was something Gu Qingfeng had anticipated.</p><p></p><p>After all, his blood and qi power had already far surpassed that of a typical Blood Qi Patriarch. Now, with his physical body undergoing another transformation, his direct advancement to the Blood Qi Patriarch Realm was not something unexpected.</p><p></p><p>Now, having broken through to the Patriarch Realm, Gu Qingfeng felt his strength had grown even greater.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

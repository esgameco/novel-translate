        <h1>Chapter 159</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With Gu Qingfeng's decisive strike that killed Jiang Shidao, the entire city suddenly fell into a deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>In the past, other outsiders who dared to defy the might of the city guards would secretly stir up trouble.</p><p></p><p>But now, those people have all disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Cause trouble? </p><p></p><p>Don't make me laugh!</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's single sword strike that killed Jiang Shidao from a distance had effectively crushed the courage of all the others.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength,</p><p></p><p>there were now only a handful in the city who could claim to be more powerful than Jiang Shidao.</p><p></p><p>Even across the Nine Provinces, Jiang Shidao's strength could be considered formidable.</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p></p><p>as an elder of the Taisuzu Sect, Jiang Shidao was ruthlessly slain by Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>The unbreakable sects could not intimidate him, let alone the others.</p><p></p><p>As a result,</p><p></p><p>the other forces did not dare to cause any trouble.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>In the city.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression remained indifferent.</p><p></p><p>It was as if killing Jiang Shidao from a distance was a trivial matter to him.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Gu Yang was still unaware of what had just happened, until he suddenly sensed a powerful surge of true qi from Gu Qingfeng, which made him feel greatly threatened.</p><p></p><p>Under the influence of this true qi, Gu Yang felt as insignificant as an ant.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>the burst of energy came and went quickly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Qingfeng's aura subside, Gu Yang couldn't help but ask, "Father, what happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Nothing, just a minor issue that I have now resolved," Gu Qingfeng replied calmly.</p><p></p><p>Although he spoke lightly, Gu Yang knew that the matter was far from simple.</p><p>But exactly what had happened, Gu Yang did not yet know.</p><p></p><p>Soon,</p><p></p><p>a city guard came to report the incident that had occurred in the city.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing that Gu Qingfeng had killed an elder of an immortal sect from a distance, Gu Yang was stunned for a long time.</p><p></p><p>After a long while,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang gradually regained his composure.</p><p>He never imagined that Gu Qingfeng's strength would be so formidable, to be able to slay an immortal sect elder with a single strike from a distance.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang truly understood why Gu Qingfeng had said he was 100% confident in dealing with the ancient Gu Yitian.</p><p></p><p>Even the sect master of the Tianyang Sword Sect might not be able to accomplish such a feat.</p><p></p><p>Instantaneously killing an immortal sect elder! This was a completely different level from just killing an immortal sect elder.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly,</p><p></p><p>a person abruptly appeared in the hall.</p><p></p><p>Almost simultaneously,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's sleeve fluttered, and a tyrannical and unparalleled gale of true qi struck out, causing the person to change expression and hastily try to block it, while also speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Patriarch Gu, please do not attack, I mean no harm--"</p><p></p><p>Before the words could finish,</p><p></p><p>the gale of true qi had already reached him.</p><p></p><p>Although the person exerted his full strength to resist, he was still knocked back several steps, his entire body's qi and blood boiling violently, unable to calm down for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you, and why have you appeared here?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not attack again, but his gaze towards the newcomer was cold, and a terrifying true intent seemed to lock him down, as if any movement from the other party would invite a devastating strike.</p><p></p><p>"I am Ancient Cloud, the sect master of the Shenwu Sect. I greet you, Senior Gu!"</p><p></p><p>Ancient Cloud dared not speak any further, deeply feeling his own insignificance under the oppressive true intent. If he had delayed even half a word, he might have been destroyed on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This is the case.</p><p></p><p>As the ancient saying goes, there is no doubt about it.</p><p></p><p>Just now, Gu Qingfeng casually unleashed a powerful gale, which almost killed him on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the strength of this Grand Master of Guangyang Prefecture, Gu Yun is now very clear about it.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression remained unchanged: "The Shenwu Sect?"</p><p></p><p>This sect is quite unfamiliar to him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang beside him said, "The Shenwu Sect is a top-tier martial arts sect in Wuzhou. It is said that the martial arts in the Shenwu Sect are thriving, and there are many top-tier martial arts experts. It is also one of the few sects that can withstand the forces of the Immortal Sects.</p><p></p><p>There are also rumors that the Shenwu Sect is the origin of all martial arts in the world.</p><p></p><p>But the specifics are up for discussion."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng finally understood.</p><p></p><p>He rarely pays attention to matters outside of Qingyan State.</p><p></p><p>But as the King of Guangyang, Gu Yang must understand the situation in the world. A top-tier power like the Shenwu Sect is something he cannot be unfamiliar with.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the other party's words,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun revealed a smile on his face and nodded, "The King of Guangyang is correct. Our Shenwu Sect is indeed the origin of all martial arts in the world."</p><p></p><p>"In the past, our Shenwu Sect's Patriarch saw the difficulties of the common people and could not bear it, so he established the Shenwu Sect and spread martial arts throughout the world, teaching the cultivation of martial arts to all.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, our Shenwu Sect's Patriarch is also revered as the Martial Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>When mentioning the title "Martial Ancestor", a hint of pride appeared on Gu Yun's face.</p><p></p><p>As the origin of all martial arts in the world, the Martial Ancestor is also revered as the number one martial artist in the world.</p><p></p><p>As the current Sect Master of the Shenwu Sect, Gu Yun naturally has the capital to be proud.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the other party's words, Gu Qingfeng's eyes also flickered slightly.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect the Shenwu Sect to have such a historical background.</p><p></p><p>Martial Ancestor!</p><p></p><p>Not everyone can be honored with the title of "Ancestor".</p><p></p><p>If Gu Yun's words are true, then the Martial Ancestor of the Shenwu Sect must be no ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>A pioneer of martial arts!</p><p></p><p>His cultivation must be at least at the Grand Master level.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise,</p><p></p><p>the martial arts in the world would not directly point to the Grand Master realm.</p><p></p><p>As the first Grand Master of martial arts, the Martial Ancestor must have an aura of mystery around him.</p><p></p><p>On the other side,</p><p></p><p>the pride on Gu Yun's face only lasted for a few breaths before disappearing without a trace, and he then self-deprecatingly smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, since the Martial Ancestor's passing, some martial artists have researched the forbidden techniques of cultivating evil, causing the profession of Sorcerers to emerge, and the status of martial artists has plummeted."</p><p></p><p>"Originally, our Shenwu Sect should have inherited the legacy of the Martial Ancestor and shouldered the responsibility of reviving martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the later generations of the Shenwu Sect were not diligent enough. After the Martial Ancestor, our Shenwu Sect has not produced a single Grand Master of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the other Immortal Sects and powerful families fearing the existence of the Martial Ancestor, our Shenwu Sect might have already disappeared in the long river of history."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun's words revealed a lot of information.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng, upon hearing the other party's words, knitted his brows.</p><p></p><p>"What you have said does not seem to have anything to do with me, does it?"</p><p></p><p>"But it does have something to do with you!" Gu Yun shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"When the Martial Ancestor passed away, he left behind a legacy. This involves secrets above the level of a Grand Master of martial arts. Unfortunately, to unravel these secrets, one must have the cultivation of a Grand Master of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>You, Sir Gu, are the only living Grand Master of martial arts in the world right now.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, judging from the battle in the prefecture city just now, where you slew the Elder of the Taisuozong with a single sword strike from a distance, your strength should have at least reached the realm of a True Meaning Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>As long as you come with me to the Shenwu Sect, and obtain the legacy left behind by the Martial Ancestor, you can help revive martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

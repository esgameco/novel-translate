        <h1>Chapter 178</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At these words, Gu Yang's expression did not change much, but the one sitting beside him, Gu Yun, had a drastic change in his complexion.</p><p></p><p>Since ancient times, plotting rebellion and treason have been considered serious crimes. The lightest punishment would be the extermination of the offender's entire family.</p><p></p><p>But now, Gu Yang has plotted rebellion, yet the court not only did not get angry, but directly conferred upon him the title of King of Guangyang, acknowledging his status. Gu Yun was naturally shocked.</p><p></p><p>However, after the initial shock, Gu Yun quickly realized why the court would act in such a manner.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Gu Yang also received another imperial edict, and his expression towards Zhao Hai softened considerably.</p><p></p><p>"I thank His Majesty for the conferment. I shall accept this imperial edict on behalf of my father!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Yang accept the conferment, Zhao Hai also revealed a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Since the King of Guangyang understands His Majesty's intentions, I have another imperial decree from His Majesty, which is to request the National Master to travel to the Central Plains."</p><p></p><p>"My father is currently in seclusion, and I do not know when he will emerge. However, as long as my father comes out of seclusion, I will definitely bring him to you, Eunuch Zhao. Furthermore, Eunuch Zhao has traveled from afar, and must be weary from the journey. Why don't you first rest at the Wang Manor for a while before returning to the Central Plains to report back?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang did not directly agree to Zhao Hai's words, but instead let out a chuckle, and directly arranged for people to take Zhao Hai away to rest.</p><p></p><p>The latter opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but was unable to.</p><p></p><p>After Zhao Hai left, Gu Yang casually discarded the two imperial edicts he was holding to the side.</p><p></p><p>If this scene were to be witnessed by an outsider, it would be considered extremely disrespectful. But whether it was Gu Yang or Gu Yun, their expressions remained calm, as if the so-called imperial edicts were just two pieces of waste paper.</p><p></p><p>"The court has sent someone to confer the title at this time, the intention is definitely not simple. Your Majesty should be more cautious," Gu Yun spoke.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang's expression remained calm: "Originally, I was not certain how dire the situation in the Central Plains was, but now it seems that the collapse of the Great Xuan Dynasty is imminent."</p><p></p><p>"Now, the one in the Central Plains has sent someone to confer the title, wanting me to serve him with just this empty position, which is rather naive!"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Gu Yang's expression had become disdainful.</p><p></p><p>He could see through the intentions of the one in the Central Plains.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Yang's age was not considered old, his experience far exceeded that of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>The moment Zhao Hai presented the imperial edict, Gu Yang had already guessed the court's intentions.</p><p></p><p>If it were someone else, they might have been tempted by the position of the King of Guangyang. </p><p></p><p>But in Gu Yang's eyes, the Great Xuan Dynasty's approach was simply trying to get something for nothing.</p><p></p><p>That's right, it was trying to get something for nothing.</p><p></p><p>He had already taken control of the entire Taishan Prefecture, so he did not need the court's conferment. Even without the so-called imperial edict, this fact would not change.</p><p></p><p>Now, the other party wanted to use this imperial edict to make him serve them, which Gu Yang found impossible.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Yang was also aware that the court's true focus was not on this King of Guangyang position itself, but on the martial arts saint behind him.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Yang summoned Gu Yi and handed him the two imperial edicts.</p><p></p><p>"These are the imperial edicts from the Great Xuan Dynasty. Take them back to my father."</p><p></p><p>"I will obey the order."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi's expression remained unchanged as he took the two imperial edicts away.</p><p></p><p>As Gu Yi left, Gu Yun spoke again: "However, the foundation of the Taixuan Dynasty is truly extraordinary. Even to this day, they can still dispatch a True Meaning Sect Master to come here.</p><p></p><p>I suspect that the Taixuan Dynasty may even have a Grand Martial Sect Master still alive!"</p><p></p><p>"Are you saying that Zhao Hai is a True Meaning Sect Master?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression shifted slightly.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he was well aware that Zhao Hai's strength was formidable, at least beyond Gu Yang's own estimation, but to call him a True Meaning Sect Master was something Gu Yang had never imagined.</p><p></p><p>After all, True Meaning Sect Masters were extremely rare in the world, each one a powerful figure comparable to Refinement Spirit Realm cultivators. Even within the immortal sects, True Meaning Sect Masters could rank among the highest echelons.</p><p></p><p>Even someone like the present Gu Yun, the Sect Master of the Shenwu Sect, was merely a True Meaning Sect Master, yet he was already a powerful leader whose sect could rival the Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>So when Gu Yun claimed that Zhao Hai was a True Meaning Sect Master, Gu Yang was truly shocked.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Yun's subsequent words stirred even more turmoil within Gu Yang's heart.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Martial Sect Masters are rarely seen in the world. Could it be that the Taixuan Dynasty truly possesses such a figure?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun shook his head and said, "It is true that Grand Martial Sect Masters are rare, but the Taixuan Dynasty has ruled over the Nine Provinces for three thousand years, with the imperial house controlling the resources of the entire realm. It would not be surprising if they had secretly cultivated such a powerful expert."</p><p></p><p>"Although the current Imperial House of Jia is a branch lineage of the immortal Jia Clan, the hearts of men are ever-changing."</p><p></p><p>"After three thousand years of evolution, the imperial house may not be willing to simply accept their fate. With the various factions gathering in the Central Plains, the Jia Clan can only watch from the sidelines."</p><p></p><p>"The fact that they have sent a True Meaning Sect Master bearing an imperial edict here makes their intentions quite clear."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang understood that Gu Yun's words were not unfounded.</p><p></p><p>However, he had no intention of interfering in the affairs of the Central Plains. Even if the imperial house had any plans, it would not affect him.</p><p></p><p>In the four commanderies of Qingyun State, he had only managed to seize one commandery so far. </p><p></p><p>To involve himself in the affairs of the Central Plains, he would need to control at least an entire state.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Yang was also aware that his foundations were still shallow. The process of seizing the entire Taishan Commandery had been too rapid, without much time for consolidation.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, the most important thing was to settle and strengthen his own power base. Only then would he have the possibility of making further moves.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if he took steps that were too ambitious, he risked overextending himself.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the affairs of the Central Plains were not something Gu Yang could currently intervene in. On the contrary, the more chaotic the situation in the Central Plains, the greater the benefits would be for him.</p><p></p><p>With all the factions focused on the Central Plains, Gu Yang could quietly consolidate his power in Qingyun State. When the time was right, he could then make a decisive move to establish his dominance.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Gu Yang had his people treat Zhao Hai lavishly. However, whenever Zhao Hai wanted to meet with Gu Qingfeng, he was always rebuffed with the excuse that Gu Qingfeng was in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Hai understood Gu Yang's intentions, and although he was dissatisfied, he was powerless to do anything about it.</p><p></p><p>After all, with Gu Yun, the Sect Master of the Shenwu Sect, stationed here, Zhao Hai knew he had no right to cause trouble, especially with a Martial Dao Saint backing Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Zhao Hai could only leave with a resentful expression.

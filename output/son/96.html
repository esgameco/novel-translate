        <h1>Chapter 96</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Inside the city of Guangyang Prefecture, when Lu Wenxuan received the news from his subordinates, his face was filled with fury and disbelief.</p><p></p><p>They're gone!</p><p></p><p>The Deputy Commander Jiang Qin and several Exorcist Cultivators at the Spirit Realm level, all of them have disappeared.</p><p></p><p>It was not long after they entered the Nine Turns Path that they lost contact.</p><p></p><p>However, </p><p></p><p>everyone knows that.</p><p></p><p>In such a situation, losing contact means that an accident has occurred.</p><p></p><p>This result, how could it not make Lu Wenxuan furious?</p><p></p><p>Although the Exorcist Agency of Guangyang Prefecture has many sorcerers, there are only a few who have reached the Spirit Realm level.</p><p></p><p>Now, </p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin and the others have gone missing, and they have most likely perished within the Nine Turns Path.</p><p></p><p>In this way, </p><p></p><p>the strength of the Exorcist Agency has suffered a heavy blow.</p><p></p><p>To put it more seriously,</p><p></p><p>the Exorcist Agency's ability to suppress the various factions in the jianghu is now highly unlikely.</p><p></p><p>There is also one more point.</p><p></p><p>That is, what kind of evil entity was able to silently slay Jiang Qin and the others.</p><p></p><p>This,</p><p></p><p>is the truly crucial and important issue.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be the evil entity that appeared in Lianxian County before? But that's impossible, that evil entity, although a Calamity-level one, has already suffered heavy damage, and for it to recover in such a short time, it should be impossible.</p><p></p><p>With Jiang Qin's strength, even if they were not a match for such an evil entity, they should not have been unable to escape - "</p><p></p><p>"The matter of the Nine Turns Path must be investigated thoroughly!"</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Lu Wenxuan immediately ordered the people of the Exorcist Agency to go to other prefectures and spread the news of what happened in the Nine Turns Path, so that strong cultivators from other places would come to provide support.</p><p></p><p>That's right!</p><p></p><p>It's to seek aid!</p><p></p><p>Since Jiang Qin and the others have already fallen into the Nine Turns Path, Lu Wenxuan naturally could not go there alone.</p><p></p><p>His strength, although stronger than Jiang Qin's, is still limited.</p><p></p><p>The evil entity in the Nine Turns Path that made Jiang Qin and the others disappear directly shows that its power is formidable, far beyond what ordinary Spirit Realm cultivators can handle.</p><p></p><p>Being the case,</p><p></p><p>Lu Wenxuan must seek aid from various parties.</p><p></p><p>The Exorcist Agency of Guangyang Prefecture is just a subordinate organization of the entire Exorcist Agency, and the other prefectures all have corresponding Exorcist Agency branches, as well as the Taishan Prefecture and even the higher Qingyun State, all of which have Exorcist Agency branches established.</p><p></p><p>These Exorcist Agency branches at various levels come down layer by layer to suppress the evil entities in different regions.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>On the other side,</p><p></p><p>the news of the incident in the Nine Turns Path has spread like a hurricane throughout the entire Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The major families and sects have all learned of this news.</p><p></p><p>Even,</p><p></p><p>some sects and families have not hesitated to send strong cultivators to enter the Nine Turns Path, wanting to subdue that evil entity.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p></p><p>the top-tier evil entities represent not only danger, but also opportunities.</p><p></p><p>If one can subdue that evil entity and then explore the methods of refining it into one's own body, then it would be equivalent to the force to which they belong possessing an extremely powerful trump card.</p><p></p><p>The first batch of the most powerful sorcerers in the world came from this.</p><p></p><p>As long as it is an evil entity, there are ways to accommodate it, only that such methods require the sacrifice of human lives.</p><p></p><p>But in the current world, human lives are often the cheapest thing.</p><p></p><p>At this time,</p><p></p><p>even the conflicts in the Taishan Dao have been somewhat slowed down.</p><p></p><p>-- </p><p></p><p>In the Gu Family Village.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the letter in his hand for a moment, then with a palm force, he directly shattered the paper.</p><p></p><p>"Now, all parties have their eyes fixed on the Nine Turns Path, trying to subdue that evil entity, the Exorcist Agency has so far been unable to do anything about it."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What? There's still no movement at all?" </p><p></p><p>As he said this, Gu Qingfeng looked at the person in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng respectfully said, "So far, the Demon Suppression Bureau has not taken any action. Perhaps they have already moved, but the news has not been leaked out."</p><p></p><p>"With the appearance of evil spirits, the Demon Suppression Bureau could not have remained inactive. The news has been buzzing, but the Demon Suppression Bureau has still not taken any action. It seems that the evil spirit on the other side of the Nine Turns Path is indeed not simple!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>When evil spirits emerge, the Demon Suppression Bureau could not possibly have shown no reaction at all. </p><p></p><p>The current calmness of the Demon Suppression Bureau is full of eeriness.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was suspicious.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Suppression Bureau has not been inactive, but has already taken action, yet they have failed to subdue the evil spirit on the other side of the Nine Turns Path, and have even suffered losses at the hands of the other party.</p><p></p><p>Only in this way would the Demon Suppression Bureau not leak the slightest wind.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has never underestimated the strength of the Demon Suppression Bureau.</p><p></p><p>For them to be beaten, it shows how terrifying the evil spirit on the Nine Turns Path is.</p><p></p><p>Then.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng told Gu Peng to leave, and he himself continued to ponder the true meaning of the Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>For several consecutive days.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was pondering the true meaning of the Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Dimly, he had a kind of premonition that made him feel as if he had touched the thin membrane of the Seventh-Level True Meaning, but he had never been able to truly break through that layer, which made Gu Qingfeng very distressed.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>These past few days, he has been fully cultivating the Tyrannical Saber Slash, as well as pondering the profundity of the Sect Master's true meaning, determined not to give up until he breaks through that barrier.</p><p></p><p>On this day.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's body, which had been sitting in meditation for a long time, suddenly trembled, and then a surging sense of will was revived, as if the entire Gu Family Manor was covered by an extremely powerful saber intent.</p><p></p><p>Many people discovered that the long sabers in their hands were trembling involuntarily, as if being pulled by something.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang, who was cultivating, also changed his expression when he sensed this movement.</p><p></p><p>"Tyrannical Saber True Meaning!"</p><p></p><p>"Father has broken through again!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang himself was also a person who had comprehended the Tyrannical Saber True Meaning, so he was very familiar with this tyrannical saber intent.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>The Tyrannical Saber True Meaning he had comprehended was much weaker in power compared to this one.</p><p></p><p>Although they came from the same source, they were fundamentally not on the same level.</p><p></p><p>In the face of such a level of Tyrannical Saber True Meaning, Gu Yang found that he did not even have the courage to wield his saber.</p><p></p><p>This was the crushing power of true meaning.</p><p></p><p>And while Gu Yang was secretly shocked, in the study, Gu Qingfeng opened his eyes, and it seemed as if a saber beam sliced through the air, his eyes sharp and keen like a saber, making it difficult for others to look directly at him.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>This powerful saber intent finally subsided.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at his own attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng  Age: 37/200  Realm: Refining Impurities Second Realm  Martial Arts: Gu Family Fist (Unbreakable First Level), Iron Body Technique (Iron Body First Level), Great Slamming Stele Hand (Perfected), Iron Leg Skill (Perfected), Refining Iron Finger (Perfected), Scorching Sun Divine Palm (Scorching Sun Palm Strength Fourth Level), Heaven Thunder Sword Technique (Beginner), Hundred Temperings Golden Body (Indestructible Golden Body Ninth Level), Seven Killing Saber Art (Killing True Meaning Second Level), Heaven Canopy Invincible Body (Protective Qi Fourth Level), Heaven Canopy Divine Body (Indestructible Divine Body First Level), Azure Yang Technique (Fifth Layer Perfected, Pure Yang Qi and Blood Fourth Level), Five Viscera Classic (Second Layer, Five Viscera Like Gods Second Level), Primordial Treasure Mirror (Second Layer, Refining Impurities Like Iron Second Level), Tyrannical Saber Slash (Minor Success, Tyrannical Saber True Meaning Seventh Level)</p><p></p><p>Upgrade Points: 4...</p><p></p><p>This year.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng is thirty-seven years old.</p><p></p><p>His Tyrannical Saber True Meaning has broken through again, taking a step forward on the foundation of the Sect Master-level true meaning.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

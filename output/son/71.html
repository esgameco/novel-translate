        <h1>Chapter 71</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Whenever natural disasters and calamities break out, there will be the emergence of strange and ominous phenomena."</p><p></p><p>"Decades ago, there was once a strange and ominous being that wiped out an entire city and its people, causing a great stir throughout the world. In the end, it was the powerful experts of the Exorcism Bureau who stepped in and slew that ominous being."</p><p></p><p>"And after the ominous being's demise, there would be left behind this black powder."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin's words made Gu Qingfeng's expression turn enlightened.</p><p></p><p>So, the thing he had slain was an ominous being.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, that ominous being might be related to the Mingrui Manor.</p><p></p><p>After all, when the Mingrui Manor was wiped out overnight, the emergence of an ominous being was also a distinct possibility.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Jiang Qin glanced at Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"You have asked all the questions you needed to, so are you willing to join the Exorcism Bureau?"</p><p></p><p>"What do I need to pay if I join the Exorcism Bureau?"</p><p></p><p>"What you need to pay by joining the Exorcism Bureau, that's hard to explain clearly. Simply put, it's just one sentence - obey orders.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, once you join the Exorcism Bureau, aside from the benefits I mentioned earlier, your Gu Manor won't have to worry about the encroachment of other sects and families.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, after you destroyed the Qingyang Sect, it has already provoked the dissatisfaction of many forces. If you don't have the protection of our Exorcism Bureau, I'm afraid you'll be facing endless troubles afterwards!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Qingfeng's brows furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"What does my Gu Manor's destruction of the Qingyang Sect have to do with other forces!"</p><p></p><p>"If you were a cultivator, then naturally it wouldn't matter. But you happen to be a martial artist, and that's different. This world is ultimately the world of cultivators, and martial artists are just inferior beings!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin sneered.</p><p></p><p>"No matter how strong martial artists are, they can only reach the level of Grandmaster, and those who can enter the Great Grandmaster realm are rare in a century."</p><p></p><p>"Guangyang Prefecture may not be that big, but it's not small either. Nominally, the imperial court is the overlord of the world, but the various forces in the jianghu are like feudal lords, each having their own territories.</p><p></p><p>Now that you have destroyed the Qingyang Sect, you have the qualifications to take over the territory that originally belonged to the Qingyang Sect.</p><p></p><p>But your Gu Manor is ultimately a force established by martial artists. How can the other sects tolerate this? After all, this is different from a small piece of land!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Qingfeng fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>After understanding the status of cultivators, he had thought that martial artists were not highly regarded, but he didn't expect their status to be so low.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of cultivators, ordinary martial artists don't even have the qualifications to dominate a region.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Gu Manor had already destroyed the Qingyang Sect and displayed astonishing power, the result was still the same.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Gu Qingfeng suddenly smiled.</p><p></p><p>"I thank the Director for the kind offer, but I have always been carefree and unrestrained, and I have no plans to join the Exorcism Bureau for now. I'm sorry about that!"</p><p></p><p>"You'd better think it through. Although the Gu Manor seems calm on the surface, it has already been targeted by many sects and families. If you join our Exorcism Bureau, the other families and sects won't make a move.</p><p></p><p>But if you insist on this, the consequences won't be that simple!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin's brows furrowed, and his expression became cold.</p><p></p><p>He thought he had already stated all the pros and cons, and if Gu Qingfeng wasn't stupid, he shouldn't have any reason to refuse.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, the other party really refused.</p><p></p><p>"I understand the pros and cons, but I also want to see whether martial artists are truly inferior to cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Gu Qingfeng's aura slightly trembled, and his powerful blood qi burst forth with a rumbling sound.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The blood qi shook the air.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Qin's expression also changed.</p><p></p><p>"Refining the Dantian!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems everyone has underestimated you."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Refine the Impure!"</p><p></p><p>He had already greatly overestimated Gu Qingfeng's strength, but unexpectedly, he had still underestimated him.</p><p></p><p>Refine the Impure! </p><p></p><p>And this kind of blood and energy power was definitely not something that ordinary Refine the Impure martial artists could match.</p><p></p><p>No wonder.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had such confidence.</p><p></p><p>After all, Refine the Impure realm martial artists were not many in the entire Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Qingfeng's resolute attitude, Jiang Qin let out a cold snort.</p><p></p><p>"Good, since the lord of the Gu Manor is so confident, then this official will not say more. But the Refine the Impure realm is not invincible either. If any problems arise, don't blame this official for not warning you."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Jiang Qin stood up and left with a sweep of his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Qingfeng was unwilling to join the Zhenxie Mansion, then there was no need for him to stay.</p><p></p><p>Originally, according to Jiang Qin's plan, if the Gu Manor refused to join the Zhenxie Mansion, he would destroy the Gu Manor and support a new force.</p><p></p><p>But now, Jiang Qin had abandoned this idea.</p><p></p><p>It was simple.</p><p></p><p>Because Gu Qingfeng was a Refine the Impure martial artist.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was only at the first level of Refine the Impure, he was still a powerful expert who had entered the Refine the Impure realm. </p><p></p><p>Looking at the entire Guangyang Prefecture, Refine the Impure martial artists were not many, and such an expert could rival the Refine the Spirit realm cultivators. If they really came to blows, Jiang Qin might not necessarily get the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>Watching Jiang Qin's retreating figure, Gu Qingfeng's eyes narrowed slightly, and then he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Come."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my lord!" </p><p></p><p>A servant hurried over upon hearing the summons.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "You will see the Commander Jiang off."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>The servant respectfully withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the direction Jiang Qin had left, and his expression gradually became indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"The Zhenxie Mansion!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that after destroying the Qingyang Sect, there will be a lot of subsequent troubles."</p><p></p><p>"I don't want to provoke trouble, but I'm not afraid of it either. If other sects and families really come to attack, then it's not my fault!"</p><p></p><p>"A man's wrath, blood splashing five steps! Gu Qingfeng will make those people understand that even though they are martial artists, they are not the ones who can easily manipulate him."</p><p></p><p>He had reached this step not by groveling and submitting.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin's purpose in this visit was to have him join the Zhenxie Mansion, but in reality, it was to make him a dog of the Zhenxie Mansion. </p><p></p><p>To obey orders, that is, to be subordinate to the Zhenxie Mansion.</p><p></p><p>If he really joined the Zhenxie Mansion, at that time, he might not even have control over his own life.</p><p></p><p>So, from the beginning, Gu Qingfeng had no intention of joining the Zhenxie Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the just-concluded conversation, a cold light flashed in Gu Qingfeng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"In short, it all comes down to a matter of strength!"</p><p></p><p>"If I were a Patriarch, or even a Grand Patriarch, or even higher than that, no matter how they are martial artists, who would dare to look down on me?"</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng's mind regained its calm.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, he didn't need to think about too much.</p><p></p><p>Defend against the incoming soldiers, block the incoming water with earth.</p><p></p><p>For now, he still needed to focus on strengthening his own strength.</p><p></p><p>However, for the sake of caution, Gu Qingfeng summoned Gu Peng again and instructed him to lead the disciples of the outer court to patrol around the Gu Manor and be vigilant for any emergencies.</p><p></p><p>In addition, he also needed to closely monitor the movements in the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>In this way, even if there were any problems, Gu Qingfeng could respond to them in a timely manner.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

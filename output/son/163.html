        <h1>Chapter 163</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Heaven and Earth are both destroyed!</p><p></p><p>When the terrifying power like an abyss was about to engulf everything, Gu Qingfeng let out a long howl, and the dormant flesh and blood in his body finally awoke completely.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The terrifying blood qi rose into the sky like the majestic sun, surging through the heavens and the earth like a mighty river flood. A scorching and surging blood qi burst forth from the top of Gu Qingfeng's head, piercing into the nine layers of the azure sky.</p><p></p><p>Blood like the sun! Illuminating the heavens and the earth!</p><p></p><p>The most unyielding and yang power swept across the scene, and all the blood mist retreated in fear as if they had encountered a terrifying existence.</p><p></p><p>This extremely unyielding and yang blood power made the Ancient Sovereign Heaven change his expression.</p><p></p><p>However, it did not stop there.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng immediately activated the two great celestial veins, and the mighty cosmic power surged in from the heavens and the earth, as if pouring into his body.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Vein Classics!</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Gu Qingfeng truly mobilized the power of the two great celestial veins.</p><p></p><p>The cosmic power infusing his body.</p><p></p><p>Causing his strength to undergo another tremendous transformation.</p><p></p><p>One celestial vein.</p><p></p><p>Would double his strength.</p><p></p><p>Two celestial veins.</p><p></p><p>Would double his strength twice.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that Gu Qingfeng's current strength was already terrifying to the extreme. With the doubling of his strength, it could be described as shaking the heavens and making the ghosts weep.</p><p></p><p>Unprecedented power awakening.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's entire body was like molten gold.</p><p></p><p>He gripped the hilt of the sword, and the power of the nine levels of true intent was also pushed to the limit.</p><p></p><p>"Slash!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng uttered a single word, like a thunderclap on a clear day, and immediately the Demon-Slaying Sword was unsheathed, the dazzling sword light slashing through the heavens and the earth, illuminating the vast void.</p><p></p><p>All the blood mist was suddenly torn in half under this terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sovereign Heaven looked at the incoming sword strike, his whole body covered in goosebumps, as if he had been targeted by a terrifying existence, making him want to turn and run.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't run! He couldn't run at all! In the face of such horrifying power, the Ancient Sovereign Heaven experienced the emotion of fear for the first time since he had entered the Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had ever felt such a deep sense of powerlessness.</p><p></p><p>Everything seemed to happen in an instant, though it felt like an eternity.</p><p></p><p>When the sword light dissipated, a strange black aura appeared in the void, extending all the way up to the nine layers of the sky before finally disappearing.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sovereign Heaven, who was suspended in midair, stood motionless, not moving a muscle.</p><p></p><p>One breath, two breaths...</p><p></p><p>A blood line appeared on the Ancient Sovereign Heaven's brow, and then his massive body was directly split in two, blood spraying across the sky.</p><p></p><p>Silence! The entire battlefield was deathly quiet.</p><p></p><p>All eyes were fixed on the figure standing there with the sword, the terrifying blood power, and the unparalleled, indestructible sword intent - every aspect of it made their hearts tremble.</p><p></p><p>"He's dead!"</p><p></p><p>"The Ancient Sovereign Heaven is dead!"</p><p></p><p>"No, it's impossible... The Ancient Sovereign Heaven is a top expert in the Nine Provinces, who could have killed him?"</p><p></p><p>"This person is far more than just an ordinary Grand Master!"</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts of the various factions were all horrified, their gazes towards Gu Qingfeng filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>They were afraid! Or rather, no one could help but be afraid! After all, the Ancient Sovereign Heaven was a true top expert, far beyond the likes of Jiang Shidao.</p><p></p><p>As the patriarch of an Immortal Sect, his strength was among the top ten in the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>Such an expert, whenever he made a move, could shake an entire province.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Unknown numbers of living beings have fallen.</p><p></p><p>But now,</p><p></p><p>This terrifying expert has been slain by a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>It shows,</p><p></p><p>The power required to slay the existence of Ancient Heavenly Monarch must be truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Sword Sect! The Ji Clan!</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Sect and other immortal sects and families are now all speechless.</p><p></p><p>On the city walls,</p><p></p><p>Ancient Cloud's body was trembling slightly, his face filled with shock and barely suppressed excitement.</p><p></p><p>"The Way of the Martial Arts shall rise!!"</p><p></p><p>"The Way of the Martial Arts shall rise!!!"</p><p></p><p>Before Gu Qingfeng acted, Ancient Cloud thought the latter would not be a match for Ancient Heavenly Monarch, and he had even prepared to risk his life to intervene and save him.</p><p></p><p>But when Gu Qingfeng truly acted, Ancient Cloud finally understood that he had completely underestimated the other party.</p><p></p><p>That sword strike,</p><p></p><p>Completely shattered the limits of the Great Masters.</p><p></p><p>Even the so-called True Meaning Great Masters would absolutely be unable to unleash such a terrifying sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Only those above the Great Masters, reaching the rumored Martial Patriarch realm, could possibly wield such a terrifying sword strike.</p><p></p><p>All along,</p><p></p><p>Ancient Cloud had thought he had evaluated Gu Qingfeng's abilities as highly as possible, but the other party kept surpassing his own understanding.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng previously slew Jiang Shidao from a distance, Ancient Cloud thought the other's true strength was that of a True Meaning Great Master.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly,</p><p></p><p>He had still underestimated.</p><p></p><p>What True Meaning Great Master!</p><p></p><p>This was a terrifying existence who had broken through the limits of the Great Masters, stepping into another realm.</p><p></p><p>Until now,</p><p></p><p>Ancient Cloud finally understood why the other party remained so calm when hearing news of the Martial Patriarchs, and regarding the inheritance secrets above the Great Masters.</p><p></p><p>It turned out,</p><p></p><p>The other party simply did not care about the Martial Patriarch inheritance.</p><p></p><p>After all, for one who had already stepped into the realm above the Great Masters, why would they truly care about such things.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>It was soon discovered that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>For after Ancient Heavenly Monarch's demise, the evil energy within him did not revive, and the eerie, icy aura in the air was gradually dissipating.</p><p></p><p>This change left the others with doubtful and uncertain expressions.</p><p></p><p>Moments later,</p><p></p><p>Someone seemed to have realized something, their pupils suddenly widening.</p><p></p><p>"The evil energy is dead!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing these words,</p><p></p><p>All present were greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>The evil energy is dead!? When they heard this, their first reaction was that it was impossible.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was a widely accepted fact that the evil energy could not be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful the martial artists or sorcerers were, they only had the ability to suppress and seal the evil energy, not truly slay it.</p><p></p><p>This was also why the evil energy was rampaging unchecked in the current world, and why sorcerers were growing increasingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>The evil energy could not be destroyed.</p><p>It was impossible to truly eliminate it.</p><p></p><p>Many had initially cultivated the evil energy within themselves, not only to obtain its formidable power in the hopes of finding a way to destroy it, but also to use their own flesh and blood to contain the evil energy.</p><p></p><p>After all, the supply of gold was limited.</p><p>As the evil energy continued to proliferate, the day would come when the gold would be exhausted.</p><p>Using one's own body to seal the evil energy was another method.</p><p></p><p>However, as they cultivated the evil energy, sorcerers were gradually corrupted by its power, becoming a calamity akin to the evil energy itself.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how one looks at it,</p><p>The original intention behind the birth of sorcerers was a good one.</p><p></p><p>But now,</p><p>The disappearance of the evil energy within Ancient Heavenly Monarch meant that the rumor of the evil energy's indestructibility would also be completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

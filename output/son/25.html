        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The surging blood qi was like a raging torrent, and at the same time, there was an extremely scorching aura flowing within the meridians.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, </p><p>Gu Qingfeng had leaped to become a powerful cultivator who had reached the Refined Blood Perfection realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng  Age: 35/100  Realm: Refined Blood Perfection</p><p>Martial Arts: Gu Family Fist (Unbreakable Level 1), Iron Body Technique (Iron Body Level 1), Great Slab Slamming Hand (Minor Success), Iron Leg Technique (Minor Success), Refining Iron Finger (Minor Success), Scorching Sun Divine Palm (Scorching Sun Palm Strength Level 4 of the Ninth Realm)</p><p>Upgrade Points: 1...</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at his attribute panel, and just as he had expected, with the breakthrough of the Scorching Sun Divine Palm, his realm had directly advanced from the Intermediate Refined Blood to the Refined Blood Perfection.</p><p></p><p>No - </p><p>To be precise,</p><p>It should be considered as reaching the Threshold of Bone Refinement.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the Threshold of Bone Refinement is not considered a separate realm, so the attribute panel only shows the Refined Blood Perfection.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Qingfeng was very clear that the moment his Scorching Sun Divine Palm reached perfection, his cultivation had already surpassed the ordinary Refined Blood Perfection and stepped into the Threshold of Bone Refinement realm recorded in the Scorching Sun Divine Palm.</p><p></p><p>And when the Scorching Sun Divine Palm reached the Fifth Realm, this mid-grade martial art gained a new characteristic called Scorching Sun Palm Strength.</p><p></p><p>With each subsequent realm advancement, the Scorching Sun Palm Strength would also increase by one level.</p><p></p><p>Now at the Ninth Realm of Perfection,</p><p>The Scorching Sun Palm Strength had reached Level 4.</p><p></p><p>The Level 4 Scorching Sun Palm Strength, while flowing as a scorching torrent within the meridians, was also gradually permeating into his own bones, refining his bones at an extremely slow pace.</p><p></p><p>Beyond Refined Blood!</p><p>This is Bone Refinement!</p><p></p><p>Bone Refinement, </p><p>As the name suggests, is the refinement of the bones.</p><p></p><p>Now, the power of the Scorching Sun Palm Strength was slowly self-refining his bones. Gu Qingfeng had a premonition that even if he no longer cultivated in the future, and just let the Scorching Sun Palm Strength self-refine, he would be able to directly break through the Refined Blood barrier and advance to the Bone Refinement realm.</p><p></p><p>This discovery,</p><p>Also shocked Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I have underestimated the power of the Scorching Sun Divine Palm!"</p><p></p><p>All along,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng had only thought that the Scorching Sun Divine Palm was just a powerful mid-grade martial art. But now, it appears that the perfected Scorching Sun Divine Palm might already have the qualifications to stand alongside the top-grade martial arts.</p><p></p><p>At least,</p><p>This passive method of allowing cultivators to advance to the Bone Refinement realm is not something that other mid-grade martial arts can possess.</p><p></p><p>This point,</p><p>Probably even the people of the Cloud Pavilion are unaware of.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise,</p><p>The Cloud Pavilion would definitely not have casually put the Scorching Sun Divine Palm up for auction, nor would they have sold it at such a low price.</p><p></p><p>After all, Refined Blood and Bone Refinement are completely different concepts.</p><p>With the White Stone Dao as the mainstream, Refined Blood Perfection is the pinnacle, and there is no sign of any Bone Refinement realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>This shows,</p><p>The power of Bone Refinement realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p>The cultivation of the Scorching Sun Divine Palm is extremely difficult. Gu Qingfeng spent three years just barely reaching the Fourth Realm. Considering the increasing difficulty with each realm, to cultivate it to the Ninth Realm of Perfection would be virtually impossible without several decades of effort.</p><p></p><p>Even for those with exceptional talent, the time required to cultivate the Scorching Sun Divine Palm to perfection would definitely not be short.</p><p></p><p>Additionally -</p><p>This advancement has also revealed another thing to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"For low-grade martial arts, the minimum upgrade points required to break the limit is five. And for each subsequent limit break, the required upgrade points would be even more than the previous one.</p><p></p><p>But for the Scorching Sun Divine Palm, starting from the Fifth Realm which involves the Refined Blood realm, each advancement only requires a fixed two upgrade points.</p><p></p><p>From this,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It can be seen that the advancement points required for the promotion of higher-level martial arts are much less than those for ordinary martial arts - this is a shortcut to improving one's strength.</p><p></p><p>The same amount of advancement points, when applied to higher-level martial arts, often work much better than on lower-level martial arts. </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's thoughts stirred again, and he tried to break through the limit of the Scorching Sun Palm technique. However, he found that it would require around 10 advancement points to break through the limit of the Scorching Sun Palm.</p><p></p><p>As a result, he temporarily abandoned the idea of breaking through the limit of the Scorching Sun Palm.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng took out the Heavenly Thunder Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>Given his current cultivation level and perspective, comprehending the Heavenly Thunder Sword Technique was an easy task for him.</p><p></p><p>In half an hour, Gu Qingfeng had fully comprehended the Heavenly Thunder Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>His attribute panel also gained some additional text:</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Thunder Sword Technique (Novice): Unlike the Scorching Sun Palm cultivation technique, the Heavenly Thunder Sword Technique is more inclined towards attack techniques. This martial art is divided into four levels: Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Perfected, similar to the Crushing Mountain Fist.</p><p></p><p>However, when Gu Qingfeng wanted to advance the Heavenly Thunder Sword Technique, he found that the consumption required for the promotion of this martial art was the same as that of the Scorching Sun Palm from the fifth layer onwards.</p><p></p><p>It can be seen that for mid-grade martial arts, the consumption required for advancement in the blood refinement aspect is quite similar.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng only had a single advancement point left, so he had no possibility of advancing the Heavenly Thunder Sword Technique to the Novice level.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Cultivation breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not disturb anyone.</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, he was consolidating his own realm, and on the basis of taking blood refining pills to assist his cultivation, Gu Qingfeng had completely stabilized his Half-Step Bone Forging realm.</p><p></p><p>A comprehensive cultivation breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>A cold glint appeared in Gu Qingfeng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to settle all matters!"</p><p></p><p>Half-Step Bone Forging! </p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had two martial arts that had broken through their limits, as well as one top-tier mid-grade martial art that had reached the Perfected level. Gu Qingfeng was confident that his current strength, within the Half-Step Bone Forging realm, was among the top tier.</p><p></p><p>Even the self-proclaimed unrivaled Iron Bone Sect Master would not be his match.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Gu Qingfeng came to the hall and summoned Gu Yang and Meng Peng.</p><p></p><p>"Father (Family Head)!"</p><p></p><p>The two of them saluted Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>After the salute, they both clearly felt that Gu Qingfeng of today was different from the past.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Gu Yang and Meng Peng exchanged a glance, and then Gu Yang tentatively asked, "Could it be that Father has also made a breakthrough?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I've had some enlightenment these past few days and have made a breakthrough, I suppose," Gu Qingfeng nodded.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he suddenly realized that Gu Qingfeng's waiting for a month was not to let him make a breakthrough, but to give himself time to find a breakthrough opportunity.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Meng Peng was also shaken upon hearing of Gu Qingfeng's breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was not clear about Gu Qingfeng's true strength, but Meng Peng was very clear about it.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's strength had already reached the level of Blood Refining Perfected years ago, and now with another breakthrough, how terrifying would his strength be? Half-Step Bone Forging? Or even Bone Forging realm?</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng dared not imagine.</p><p></p><p>But one thing he could understand - this time, the Gu family has stabilized its position.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)"</p>

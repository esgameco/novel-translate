        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>神无道stood dumbfounded in place, and in the next breath, a bloody mark appeared on his brow, then spread down.</p><p></p><p>"Pu ci!"</p><p></p><p>His body split in two.</p><p></p><p>In the moment神无道perished, the Vajra Buddha in the black mist completely awoke, the layers of shackles shattering, and a terrifying, icy aura burst forth.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>The horrifying, ferocious roar shook the surroundings, causing Gu Peng and the others to feel an indescribable oppression, making their breathing much more difficult.</p><p></p><p>The evil entity had revived!</p><p></p><p>Like a demonic monster emerging into the world!</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was cold, and the moment the Vajra Buddha had just revived, the Demon-Slaying Blade had already sliced through the air. The latter instinctively raised his hand to block, but could not withstand the power of the blade.</p><p></p><p>"Pu ci!"</p><p></p><p>The arm was severed from the body.</p><p></p><p>A large amount of pitch-black blood gushed out.</p><p></p><p>The earth corroded,</p><p></p><p>As if it was suffering from a terrible, toxic corrosion.</p><p></p><p>The excruciating pain of the severed arm made the Vajra Buddha's expression even angrier, his scarlet eyes wanting to completely devour Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the opponent's intact left arm struck out, black mist surging, the air seemingly completely frozen by this icy aura.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was unafraid: "I've already killed神无道, a mere evil entity sealed within, how much of a storm could it possibly stir up!"</p><p></p><p>The words fell.</p><p></p><p>The blade struck.</p><p></p><p>The Demon-Slaying Blade's cold light flashed, and in the blink of an eye, it had slashed out dozens or even hundreds of times, leaving terrifying, ghastly wounds on the Vajra Buddha's body.</p><p></p><p>In the next breath,</p><p></p><p>The wounds expanded.</p><p></p><p>Then the Vajra Buddha's physical body suddenly shattered.</p><p></p><p>The head was split in two, and the massive body was divided into dozens of fragments, but the evil entity's life force, which could be considered defying the heavens, even to this extent, still had not truly perished.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the evil entity's corpse eerily writhing, about to self-heal, Gu Qingfeng's expression remained cold.</p><p></p><p>"Bring the item!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes—"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng did not dare to delay, hurriedly going into the carriage and soon bringing out a golden coffin.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng opened the coffin lid, seeing the corpse was about to fully heal and recover, so he directly threw it into the golden coffin, then closed the lid, completely sealing it.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's palm slid across the blade's edge, a large amount of fresh blood spraying out from the wound, and then this blood fell onto the surface of the golden coffin, with a terrifying blood pressure comparable to a great furnace, instantly calming the previously violently shaking coffin lid.</p><p></p><p>This was another method Gu Qingfeng had discovered to suppress the evil entity - blood suppression, but it required the assistance of gold.</p><p></p><p>The blood energy of a powerful warrior was both a great tonic for the evil entity, but also had tremendous restraining power over it.</p><p></p><p>Especially now that Gu Qingfeng had perfected his bone refinement and his cultivation had reached the fifth realm of Refining the Viscera, his blood energy had been honed to a terrifying degree.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, with the evil entity already sealed within the golden coffin, suppressing it with blood was an effortless task.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked towards the outside of the Divine Fist Sect.</p><p></p><p>There,</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura was approaching.</p><p></p><p>Soon,</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged man in white robes slowly walked over. Each of his steps seemed simple, but could directly cross dozens of feet, in just a few breaths, the man had already arrived here.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the devastated state of the Divine Fist Sect and the lingering icy aura in the air, his brow immediately furrowed, and upon seeing the golden</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When the coffin was being carried, the face finally showed a subtle change.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected that you would actually kill Shen Wudao!"</p><p></p><p>Duan Ping looked at Gu Qingfeng deeply.</p><p></p><p>Slaying Shen Wudao! The strength of the person before him left Duan Ping feeling shocked.</p><p></p><p>Originally, after learning that Gu Family Manor was going to attack the Shenquan Sect, Duan Ping had directly rushed towards the Shenquan Sect, but he didn't expect to arrive a step too late.</p><p></p><p>The Shenquan Sect was destroyed.</p><p>Shen Wudao had perished.</p><p>Judging from the appearance, the evil forces that had awakened within him were all suppressed by the person before him.</p><p></p><p>"A subordinate of Pei Jing?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was indifferent.</p><p>He could see that the aura around Duan Ping was extremely powerful, and he should also be a master-level expert.</p><p></p><p>Duan Ping said with his hands behind his back, "I am Duan Ping, an elder of the Tianyang Sword Sect. Pei Jing is a person supported by our Tianyang Sword Sect. Now that the Shenquan Sect has submitted to Pei Jing, it is essentially under the Tianyang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>You have now destroyed the Shenquan Sect and killed Shen Wudao, which means you are going against my Tianyang Sword Sect.</p><p>Have you considered the consequences of this?"</p><p></p><p>Tianyang Sword Sect!</p><p>When the others heard these words, their expressions changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng licked his lips, his expression slightly strange: "I've heard that the Tianyang Sword Sect is an immortal sect with a history of over a thousand years, and there are many powerful experts within the sect. </p><p>However, I'm curious, just how many powerful experts does the Tianyang Sword Sect have?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you don't need to test us. The Tianyang Sword Sect has a deep and solid foundation that has lasted for a millennium, and the number of master-level experts is abundant. Even sorcerers more powerful than masters exist within our sect.</p><p>Such strength is beyond your imagination."</p><p></p><p>Duan Ping's expression was arrogant.</p><p>He indeed had the right to be proud.</p><p>The Tianyang Sword Sect had a powerful foundation, and it was truly one of the top existences in the entire world.</p><p>As an elder of the Tianyang Sword Sect, Duan Ping also held a high position and authority.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that he saw Gu Qingfeng defeating Shen Wudao, Duan Ping wouldn't have bothered to talk to him so much.</p><p></p><p>"The Shenquan Sect has been destroyed, and Shen Wudao is dead. The situation is irreversible. How do you think this matter should be resolved?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Gu Qingfeng's words, Duan Ping thought the other party had surrendered, so he coldly said, "Hand over the evil forces that Shen Wudao was harboring, have the Gu Family Manor submit to my Tianyang Sword Sect, and then cooperate with Pei Jing to conquer Guangyang Prefecture. Then this crime can be forgiven.</p><p>Otherwise, when the powerful experts of my Tianyang Sword Sect arrive, I will ensure that the Gu Family Manor is completely wiped out without leaving a single chicken or dog."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, they say the immortal sects are undefeatable and the true overlords of the world, but I'm afraid I don't believe that."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head slightly, his words causing Duan Ping's expression to turn gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean by that?"</p><p></p><p>"My meaning is simple. If I kill you, I wonder if the Tianyang Sword Sect really has the strength to destroy my Gu Family Manor!"</p><p></p><p>A cold glint flashed in Gu Qingfeng's eyes, and as soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly unleashed a terrifying Hegemon Sword Dao, enveloped in a murderous aura that rushed towards Duan Ping, causing his expression to change drastically.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you attack me—"</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that after learning of his identity, Gu Qingfeng would actually say he would attack and then immediately do so.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Hegemon Sword Dao slashing towards him, Duan Ping also activated his innate spiritual energy to protect his body, forming a powerful defensive barrier within a three-zhang radius.</p><p></p><p>Just as the innate spiritual energy appeared, the Exorcism Sword had already fiercely struck.</p><p>The terrifying and domineering power collided with the defensive barrier, and to Duan Ping's horrified gaze, the thick spiritual energy barrier began to crack inch by inch, and then shattered completely.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

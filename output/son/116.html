        <h1>Chapter 116</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>神无道 (Shen Wudao) stood motionless in his place. In the next breath, a bloody mark appeared on his brow, then spread downwards.</p><p></p><p>"Pu ci!"</p><p></p><p>His body was split in two.</p><p></p><p>At the moment Shen Wudao perished, the Vajra Buddha in the black mist completely awoke, the layers of shackles shattering, and a terrifying, icy aura burst forth.</p><p></p><p>"Hou!"</p><p></p><p>The ferocious, rumbling roar shook the surroundings, causing Gu Peng and the others to feel an indescribable oppression, making their breathing much more difficult.</p><p></p><p>The evil entity had revived! </p><p>Like a demonic monster emerging into the world!</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was cold. The moment the Vajra Buddha revived, the Demon-Slaying Blade had already sliced through the air. The latter instinctively raised a hand to block, but could not withstand the power of the blade.</p><p></p><p>"Pu ci!"</p><p></p><p>The arm was severed from the body.</p><p></p><p>A large amount of pitch-black blood gushed out.</p><p>The earth was corroded, as if suffering from a terrible, toxic erosion.</p><p></p><p>The excruciating pain of the severed arm made the Vajra Buddha's expression even angrier, its scarlet eyes burning with the desire to completely devour Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the opponent's intact left arm struck out, the black mist surging, the air seemingly frozen by this icy aura.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was unafraid: "I've already killed Shen Wudao, so a mere evil entity sealed within can't stir up that much of a storm!"</p><p></p><p>The words fell.</p><p>The blade struck.</p><p></p><p>The Demon-Slaying Blade's cold light flashed, and in the blink of an eye, it had slashed out dozens or even hundreds of times, leaving terrifying, grisly wounds on the Vajra Buddha's body.</p><p></p><p>In the next breath, the wounds expanded.</p><p>Then the Vajra Buddha's physical body suddenly shattered.</p><p></p><p>The head was split in two, and the massive body was broken into dozens of fragments. But the evil entity's life force, which could be considered defying the heavens, had not truly perished, even to this extent.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the evil entity's corpse writhing in a bizarre manner, attempting to heal itself, Gu Qingfeng's expression remained cold.</p><p></p><p>"Bring the item!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng did not dare to delay, hastily going to the interior of the carriage and soon bringing out a golden coffin.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng opened the coffin lid. Seeing the entity's body about to fully heal and recover, he directly threw it into the golden coffin, then closed the lid, completely sealing it.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Gu Qingfeng's palm slid across the blade's edge, causing a large amount of fresh blood to spurt out from the wound. This blood then fell onto the surface of the golden coffin, its terrifying blood qi, akin to a great furnace, instantly calming the previously violently shaking coffin lid.</p><p></p><p>This was another method Gu Qingfeng had discovered to suppress the evil entity - the power of blood.</p><p>But it required the assistance of gold.</p><p></p><p>The blood qi of a powerful cultivator was both a great tonic for the evil entity, but also had immense suppressive power over it.</p><p>Especially now that Gu Qingfeng had perfected his Bone Refining and reached the fifth realm of Refining the Viscera, his blood qi had been tempered to a terrifying degree.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, with the evil entity already sealed within the golden coffin, suppressing it with his blood was a simple matter.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Qingfeng looked towards the outside of the Shenquan Sect.</p><p>There, a powerful aura was approaching.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a middle-aged man in white robes slowly walked over. Each of his steps seemed simple, but could directly cross dozens of feet, arriving here in just a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the devastation of the Shenquan Sect and the lingering icy aura in the air, the man's brow immediately furrowed. Upon seeing the golden coffin...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When the coffin was opened, the face finally showed a subtle change.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that you actually killed Shen Wudao!"</p><p></p><p>Duan Ping looked deeply at Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Slaying Shen Wudao! The strength of the person before him left Duan Ping feeling shocked.</p><p></p><p>Originally, after learning that Gu Manor was about to attack the Shenquan Sect, Duan Ping had rushed directly towards the Shenquan Sect, but he didn't expect to have arrived a step too late.</p><p></p><p>The Shenquan Sect was destroyed.</p><p>Shen Wudao had perished.</p><p>Judging from the appearance, the evil forces that had awakened within him were all suppressed by the person before him.</p><p></p><p>"A subordinate of Pei Jing?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was indifferent.</p><p>He could see that the aura surrounding Duan Ping was extremely powerful, and he should also be a master-level expert.</p><p></p><p>Duan Ping said with his hands behind his back, "I am Duan Ping, an elder of the Tianyang Sword Sect. Pei Jing is a person supported by our Tianyang Sword Sect. Now that the Shenquan Sect has submitted to Pei Jing, it is essentially under the jurisdiction of our Tianyang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>You have now destroyed the Shenquan Sect and killed Shen Wudao, which means you are going against our Tianyang Sword Sect.</p><p>Have you considered the consequences of this?"</p><p></p><p>Tianyang Sword Sect!</p><p>Hearing these words, the expressions of the other people changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng licked his lips, his expression slightly strange: "I've heard that the Tianyang Sword Sect is an immortal sect with a history of thousands of years, and there are many powerful experts within the sect.</p><p>However, I'm curious, just how many powerful experts does the Tianyang Sword Sect have?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you don't need to probe further. The foundation of our Tianyang Sword Sect is deeply rooted, with numerous master-level experts. Even sorcerers stronger than masters exist among us.</p><p>Such power is beyond your imagination."</p><p></p><p>Duan Ping's expression was arrogant.</p><p>He indeed had the right to be proud.</p><p>The Tianyang Sword Sect had a solid foundation, and it was truly one of the top existences in the entire world.</p><p>As an elder of the Tianyang Sword Sect, Duan Ping also held a high position and authority.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that he saw Gu Qingfeng had slain Shen Wudao, Duan Ping wouldn't have bothered to talk to him so much.</p><p></p><p>"The Shenquan Sect has been destroyed, and Shen Wudao is dead. The situation is irreversible. How do you think this matter should be resolved?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Gu Qingfeng's words, Duan Ping thought the other party had surrendered, so he coldly said, "Hand over the evil forces that Shen Wudao harbored, have Gu Manor submit to our Tianyang Sword Sect, and then cooperate with Pei Jing to conquer Guangyang Prefecture. Then this crime can be forgiven.</p><p>Otherwise, when the experts of our Tianyang Sword Sect arrive, Gu Manor will be wiped out without leaving a single chicken or dog."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, they say the immortal sects are undefeatable and the true overlords of the world, but I'm afraid I don't believe that."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head slightly, and his words made Duan Ping's expression turn gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean by that?"</p><p></p><p>"My meaning is simple. If I kill you, I wonder if the Tianyang Sword Sect really has the power to destroy my Gu Manor!"</p><p></p><p>A cold glint flashed in Gu Qingfeng's eyes, and as soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly unleashed a terrifying Hegemon Sword Dao, enveloped in an aura of murderous intent, rushing towards Duan Ping, causing his expression to change drastically.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you attack me—"</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that after learning of his identity, Gu Qingfeng would actually say he would attack and then immediately do so.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Hegemon Sword Dao rushing towards him, Duan Ping also activated his innate spiritual energy to form a protective barrier. The powerful true qi transformed into a formidable defensive barrier, creating an absolute defense within a radius of three zhang.</p><p></p><p>Just as the innate spiritual energy appeared, the Exorcism Sword had already fiercely slashed down.</p><p>The terrifying and domineering power struck the protective barrier, and to Duan Ping's horrified gaze, the sturdy spiritual energy barrier began to crack inch by inch, and then shattered completely.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 89</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Left Standing!"</p><p></p><p>"Your subordinate is here!"</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged martial artist knelt on one knee and clasped his fists, saying, "I am at your service."</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing spoke, "You will go to the Gu Family Manor and inform Gu Qingfeng that as long as he is willing to assist me, all past grievances can be forgiven. Furthermore, any requests he may have, I can fulfill. Whether it is the secret techniques of a grandmaster, or the esoteric methods of cultivating demonic arts, I can satisfy them all."</p><p></p><p>If Gu Qingfeng was just an ordinary minor sect master, Pei Jing would not have been so concerned about him.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>A half-step grandmaster is different.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful cultivator who has grasped the true essence of the Dao, once they break through the grandmaster realm, they will be among the mightiest of the grandmaster experts.</p><p></p><p>In the absence of great grandmasters, a true essence grandmaster can be considered a king.</p><p></p><p>Even if martial artists are inferior to spell cultivators, a true essence grandmaster of that level is beyond the reach of mere御灵境 spell cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The benefits of being able to recruit such a powerful ally are self-evident.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Pei Jing was willing to put aside past grievances and pay a heavy price to have someone go and persuade Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Those who aspire to great deeds do not get bogged down in petty matters.</p><p></p><p>In Pei Jing's eyes, the grudges between them were utterly insignificant.</p><p></p><p>"I will carry out your orders!" </p><p></p><p>Left Standing immediately accepted the command and withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Watching the retreating figure, Pei Jing stepped out of the command tent, his gaze falling upon the ancient city before him, with all his generals gathered behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Danshan City!"</p><p></p><p>"I order you all to capture Danshan City within three days and thoroughly breach the gates of the Liuyun Mansion!"</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Danshan City was the gateway to the Liuyun Mansion, which was an important location at the border of Taishan and Danyang Commanderies. If he could capture Danshan City, he would be able to truly mobilize forces against the entire Liuyun Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Once he controlled the Liuyun Mansion, Taishan Commandery would also be opened up.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the geographical position of Danshan City was of great significance, and it was also heavily guarded.</p><p></p><p>To breach Danshan City, Pei Jing did not hesitate to personally lead an army of 300,000, but even with this massive force, they had been unable to capture the city after two days of fierce assault.</p><p></p><p>This showed just how tenacious the resistance of Danshan City was.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how strong Danshan City's defenses were, Pei Jing was determined to capture it in the shortest time possible, for if he delayed too long, the reinforcements from Taishan Commandery would arrive, making it much harder to take the city.</p><p></p><p>Such an important strategic opportunity was not something Pei Jing could afford to miss.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Shenwu Army's principle was to strike with full force in one decisive blow.</p><p></p><p>If they were to be defeated at Danshan City, it could even jeopardize the fortune they were meant to have.</p><p></p><p>This was something Pei Jing absolutely could not accept.</p><p></p><p>As Pei Jing's words fell, all the generals nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, rest assured, we will capture Danshan City within three days!"</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>In Guangyang Prefecture, inside the Exorcism Bureau, Lu Wenxuan also had intelligence reports regarding the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Qingfeng, the 'Tyrannical Saber', is suspected to be a half-step grandmaster. He slew the Peak Master of the Crimson Flame Sect, Wen Jiao, with a single stroke, displaying astonishing power, and thus earned the title of 'Tyrannical Saber'."</p><p></p><p>"Vice Commander Jiang had previously said that Gu Qingfeng was just a minor sect master, but it seems he had hidden his true strength quite deeply."</p><p></p><p>His words caused Jiang Qin's expression to change again.</p><p></p><p>He had not expected Gu Qingfeng's strength to be so deeply concealed.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Jiang Qin said, "Gu Qingfeng has indeed hidden his power very well. I misjudged him, Senior Lu. What do you think we should do next?"</p><p></p><p>"A half-step grandmaster is no ordinary person. If he can break through to the grandmaster realm, he will become a true essence grandmaster, one of the mightiest experts below the great grandmasters. If we can recruit such a powerful ally to the Exorcism Bureau, it would be a great accomplishment.</p><p></p><p>So next, I will have to trouble Vice Commander Jiang to go to the Gu Family Manor again."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Take a trip, and you can also improve the conditions and treatment a bit. Furthermore, Gu Qingfeng is so reckless in his actions, and even if Vice Commander Jiang fails to win him over, there's no need to tear off his face!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Wenxuan looked at the other party deeply, and then spoke up to remind him.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin's face looked a bit unsightly, but he could only lower his head and reply, "Lord Lu, don't worry, this official knows how to conduct himself!"</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, it's for the best."</p><p></p><p>Lu Wenxuan waved his hand, and Jiang Qin immediately took his leave.</p><p></p><p>"A Half-Step Grandmaster!"</p><p></p><p>"This person's origins are mysterious, and perhaps there is a true Grandmaster backing him, and being able to instruct such a powerful person, he must at least be a True Meaning Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Even... he might be a Great Grandmaster!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Wenxuan murmured softly.</p><p></p><p>Although Great Grandmasters are rare in the jianghu, it doesn't mean they have disappeared completely.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Qingfeng was just an ordinary low-level Grandmaster, Lu Wenxuan would only think that he had obtained some fortuitous encounters, allowing him to reach this level.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>A Half-Step Grandmaster is different.</p><p></p><p>This is not something that can be explained away by mere fortuitous encounters.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the other party's current age, Lu Wenxuan has reason to suspect that Gu Qingfeng has a powerful backer behind him.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Gu Family Manor may just be a facade.</p><p></p><p>A suspected True Meaning Grandmaster or even a Great Grandmaster-level expert, Lu Wenxuan must treat him seriously.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>He had Jiang Qin go to the Gu Family Manor again to invite Gu Qingfeng to join the Zhenxie Agency.</p><p></p><p>Even if the other party is unwilling to join, it would be a friendly signal from the Zhenxie Agency, so as not to cause any conflicts or troubles in the future.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes.</p><p></p><p>If a Half-Step Grandmaster is not necessary to offend, it's best not to.</p><p></p><p>Even if he can't win the other party over to the Zhenxie Agency, he should at least try to get on good terms with him.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>Inside the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng still spends most of his time cultivating.</p><p></p><p>He is still mainly cultivating the Five Viscera Sutra, and then the Qingyang Technique and the Mixuan Baojian.</p><p></p><p>As for the Scarlet Flame Divine Skill he obtained earlier, Gu Qingfeng hasn't touched it for the time being.</p><p></p><p>It's very simple.</p><p></p><p>It's because a person's energy is limited.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng is currently cultivating multiple martial arts simultaneously, which is almost his limit, and if he continues to cultivate more martial arts, he will find it difficult to take care of so many.</p><p></p><p>During this time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng would occasionally guide Gu Yang in his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The latter has already broken through to the intermediate Blood Refining realm, but Gu Qingfeng is now a powerful expert in the second realm of Impurity Refining, so guiding a Blood Refining realm cultivator is an easy task for him.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has also collected many medicinal bath pill formulas required for martial arts cultivation, as well as some precious medicinal materials to assist in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>High-level medicinal bath pill formulas are rare, and they are controlled by the major sects and families, so Gu Qingfeng has only managed to collect some formulas for the Skin Refining realm and Blood Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>But even so, it's enough for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has handed over these collected pill formulas to Gu Yang, letting him handle them.</p><p></p><p>After all.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng currently has no intention of getting too involved in the affairs of the Gu Family Manor, and anything that he doesn't need to personally handle, he leaves it to Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>As for this.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang naturally won't refuse.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>"This is the Gu Family Manor!"</p><p></p><p>Li Standing looked at the manor in front of him, his gaze slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>Immediately.</p><p></p><p>He went to a guard and directly handed over his invitation letter, then waited quietly.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 123</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The following time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng devoted himself fully to cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The two supreme skills he was currently cultivating were:</p><p></p><p>Crimson Flame Divine Skill!</p><p>Prajna True Scriptures!</p><p></p><p>The former was still stuck at the fourth level of perfection, and he still needed some time to refine it before breaking through to the fifth level.</p><p></p><p>As for the latter,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng discovered that after refining his physical body to perfection, the difficulty of cultivating the three stages of refining the skin, blood, and bones had all significantly decreased.</p><p></p><p>In his view,</p><p></p><p>This was because his physical body had reached perfection, with nothing else needing refinement, so the breakthroughs in these three realms were as simple as eating and drinking.</p><p></p><p>In less than a month,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had cultivated the Prajna True Scriptures to the third level of perfection.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Although this breakthrough in the Prajna True Scriptures was very fast, it had almost no change to his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng understood the reason for this.</p><p></p><p>It was still the same.</p><p></p><p>His physical body had reached perfection.</p><p></p><p>It had reached a point where there was no further progress possible.</p><p></p><p>No matter how profound the Prajna True Scriptures were, they could not bring any changes to his perfect physical body.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Once the Prajna True Scriptures broke through to the fourth level and entered the Marrow Cleansing Realm, then it would be different.</p><p></p><p>Because -</p><p></p><p>So far, Gu Qingfeng had not yet reached the perfect Marrow Cleansing stage.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Marrow Cleansing had not reached a flawless level, each cultivation of a Marrow Cleansing technique could bring a slight increase to his own strength.</p><p></p><p>As for the extent of the increase, it would depend on how deeply the cultivated technique could refine the Marrow Cleansing realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the Whetstone Hall,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sat cross-legged, his blood qi surging, like a raging river, wave after wave crashing against his physical body, just like the Yijing Marrow Cutting.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was now indeed practicing the Yijing Marrow Cutting.</p><p></p><p>To be precise,</p><p></p><p>It should be called Marrow Cleansing.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the Prajna True Scriptures for more than half a year, Gu Qingfeng had finally reached the point of breaking through to the fourth level.</p><p></p><p>Now, his entire body was filled with powerful blood qi, constantly cleansing the marrow, removing the impurities in the marrow, and gradually approaching a perfect state.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and Gu Qingfeng's body trembled, and the thin layer of dirt on the surface of his flesh was directly shaken off.</p><p></p><p>He opened his tightly closed eyes.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng exhaled a mouthful of turbid air.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>He looked at his own attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Prajna True Scriptures (Fourth Level Entry, Prajna True Body Level 3)!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I've finally broken through!"</p><p></p><p>A rare smile appeared on Gu Qingfeng's face.</p><p></p><p>After half a year of arduous cultivation,</p><p></p><p>He had finally taken the crucial step, allowing the Prajna True Scriptures to break through the barrier of the third level and enter the fourth level.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the fourth level,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng truly experienced the power of this supreme skill.</p><p></p><p>"The creator of the Prajna True Scriptures was extraordinary. Without going into other aspects, this supreme skill is already perfect in the Marrow Cleansing realm.</p><p></p><p>In that case, I won't need too many top-tier martial arts to break through the perfect Marrow Cleansing!"</p><p></p><p>The Marrow Cleansing chapter of the Prajna True Scriptures is equivalent to the accumulation of several top-tier martial arts.</p><p></p><p>And at the moment the Prajna True Scriptures broke through the fourth level, Gu Qingfeng immediately used his Improvement Points to break through.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Ten Improvement Points!"</p><p>"Prajna True Scriptures Fourth Level Mastery!"</p><p></p><p>"Ten Improvement Points!"</p><p>"Prajna True Scriptures Fourth Level Perfection!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In almost an instant, Gu Qingfeng directly promoted the Prajna Sutra to the fourth stage of great accomplishment, reaching near the level of fourth stage perfection.</p><p></p><p>With such an advancement,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng felt that his strength had increased by at least one level.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the remaining three upgrade points, shook his head slightly, and abandoned the idea of continuing to upgrade, and then turned his attention to the information panel.</p><p></p><p>Half a year later,</p><p></p><p>The information panel was constantly refreshing with new information.</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been continuously recruiting and his forces are growing stronger!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain 186 Refining Skin Realm cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain 78 Refining Skin Realm mid-level cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain 1 Refining Blood Realm late-stage cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has breached the Liuyun Stronghold and gained a bountiful harvest!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has gained insights during battle, slightly improving his strength!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has gained some insights in cultivating the Gu Family Fist, with a slight increase in strength!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has gained some insights in cultivating the Gu Family Fist, with a slight increase in strength!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' is facing an attack from a late-stage Refining Bone Realm expert!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' is facing an attack from a mid-level Washing Marrow Realm expert!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring——"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Over the past half year, a large amount of information had been refreshed, with the vast majority of it related to Gu Yang, occasionally interspersed with information about Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>The latter two were essentially just background characters.</p><p></p><p>This was a very normal situation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu were too young, and they were basically just cultivating within the Gu Family Manor, so they naturally didn't have much experience to speak of.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Yang, over the past half year, had been through a lot of hardship and tribulation. He was either on the path of recruiting troops, or attacking various mountain strongholds and bandit nests, plundering resources from these Green Forest forces.</p><p></p><p>In common parlance,</p><p></p><p>It was a case of "black-on-black"! If it happened once or twice, it would be fine, but the more he did it, the more likely it was that he would attract attention.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng was not too worried, as he had entrusted the command of the hundred-man elite guard to Gu Yang, and the three elite guard commanders were all at the peak of the Refining Filth Realm. As long as no Patriarch-level experts intervened, there wouldn't be any major problems.</p><p></p><p>So although the information panel was refreshing frequently, and there were even occasional attacks from Washing Marrow Realm experts, Gu Yang had been navigating these challenges with ease so far.</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was not reckless in his actions.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this son of his, Gu Qingfeng had a sufficient understanding.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the Liuyun Stronghold,</p><p></p><p>The scene was now one of carnage, with bodies strewn everywhere. All the bandits had been slaughtered, and Gu Yang's clothes were stained with blood as he stood before Gu Yi, who was leading a group of elite guards.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>There was a person lying on the ground, their limbs twisted in a bizarre and unnatural way, as if they had been forcefully broken by brute strength.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at the person with an indifferent gaze and said calmly, "Tell me the purpose of your coming here, and I can make your death a quick one."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you've offended the Blood Spirit Sect, and you won't have a good end. You think you can get information out of me? Dream on!" the person spat out defiantly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression turned slightly cold.</p><p></p><p>He then looked over at Gu Yi.</p><p></p><p>"Have someone interrogate him thoroughly. I need to find out the relationship between the Blood Spirit Sect and the Liuyun Stronghold, and also who leaked our whereabouts for this operation."</p><p></p><p>"As you command!" Gu Yi responded with a fist salute, and then gestured to the elite guards, who promptly dragged the person away.</p><p></p><p>Soon,</p><p></p><p>Agonizing screams could be heard from outside, lasting for about half an hour before finally subsiding. After another half hour, the elite guard returned.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

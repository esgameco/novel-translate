        <h1>Chapter 123</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The following time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng devoted himself fully to cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The two supreme skills he was currently cultivating were:</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Divine Skill!</p><p>The Prajna Sutra!</p><p></p><p>The former was still stuck at the fourth level of perfection, and it would still take some time to break through to the fifth level.</p><p></p><p>As for the latter,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng discovered that after refining his physical body to perfection, the difficulty of cultivating the three stages of refining the skin, blood, and bones had all significantly decreased.</p><p></p><p>In his view,</p><p></p><p>This was because his physical body had reached perfection, with nothing left to refine. Therefore, the breakthroughs in these three realms were as easy as eating and drinking.</p><p></p><p>In less than a month,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had cultivated the Prajna Sutra to the third level of perfection.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Although this breakthrough in the Prajna Sutra was very fast, it had almost no impact on his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng understood the reason for this.</p><p></p><p>It was the same as before.</p><p></p><p>His physical body had reached perfection.</p><p></p><p>It had reached a point where there was no further room for improvement.</p><p></p><p>No matter how profound the Prajna Sutra was, it could not bring any changes to his perfect physical body.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Once the Prajna Sutra broke through to the fourth level and entered the Marrow Cleansing Realm, things would be different.</p><p></p><p>Because -</p><p></p><p>So far, Gu Qingfeng had not yet reached the level of perfect Marrow Cleansing.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Marrow Cleansing was not perfect and flawless, cultivating any Marrow Cleansing technique would bring a slight increase to his own strength.</p><p></p><p>As for the extent of the increase, it would depend on how deeply the cultivated technique could refine the Marrow Cleansing realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Whetstone Hall,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sat cross-legged, his blood qi surging, like a raging river, wave after wave crashing against his physical body, just like the Yijing Marrow Cutting.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was now truly practicing the Marrow Cleansing.</p><p></p><p>To be precise,</p><p></p><p>It should be called Marrow Cleansing.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the Prajna Sutra for more than half a year, Gu Qingfeng had finally reached the point of breaking through to the fourth level.</p><p></p><p>His entire body was filled with powerful blood qi, constantly cleansing the marrow, removing the impurities, and gradually approaching a state of perfection.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time had passed, Gu Qingfeng's body trembled, and the thin layer of dirt on the surface of his flesh was directly shaken off.</p><p></p><p>He opened his tightly closed eyes.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng exhaled a mouthful of turbid air.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>Subsequently,</p><p></p><p>He looked at his own attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Prajna Sutra (Fourth Level Entry, Prajna True Body Level 3)!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I've finally broken through!"</p><p></p><p>A rare smile appeared on Gu Qingfeng's face.</p><p></p><p>After half a year of arduous cultivation,</p><p></p><p>He had finally taken the crucial step, allowing the Prajna Sutra to break through the barrier of the third level and enter the fourth level.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the fourth level,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng truly experienced the power of this supreme skill.</p><p></p><p>"The creator of the Prajna Sutra was extraordinary. Without going into other aspects, this supreme skill has already reached a state of perfection in Marrow Cleansing.</p><p></p><p>In that case, I won't need too many top-tier martial arts to break through to perfect Marrow Cleansing!"</p><p></p><p>The Marrow Cleansing section of the Prajna Sutra was equivalent to the accumulation of several top-tier martial arts.</p><p></p><p>And at the moment Gu Qingfeng broke through the fourth level of the Prajna Sutra, he directly used Improvement Points to break through.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Ten Improvement Points!"</p><p>"Prajna Sutra Fourth Level Mastery!"</p><p></p><p>"Ten Improvement Points!"</p><p>"Prajna Sutra Fourth Level Perfection!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In almost an instant, Gu Qingfeng directly promoted the Prajna Sutra to the fourth level of great accomplishment, approaching the level of fourth-stage perfection.</p><p></p><p>With such an advancement,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng felt that his strength had increased by at least one level.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the remaining three upgrade points, shook his head slightly, and gave up the idea of continuing to upgrade, and then turned his attention to the information panel.</p><p></p><p>Half a year later,</p><p></p><p>The information panel was constantly refreshing with new information.</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been continuously recruiting and his forces are growing increasingly powerful!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain 186 Refining Skin Realm cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain 78 Refining Skin Realm mid-level cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain 1 Refining Blood Realm late-stage cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has breached the Liuyun Stronghold and reaped a bountiful harvest!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has gained insights during battles, slightly improving his strength!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has gained some insights in cultivating the Gu Family Fist, with a slight increase in strength!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has gained some insights in cultivating the Gu Family Fist, with a slight increase in strength!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' is facing an attack from a late-stage Refining Bone Realm expert!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' is facing an attack from a mid-level Washing Marrow Realm expert!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring——"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Over the past half year, a large amount of information had been refreshed, with the vast majority of it related to Gu Yang, occasionally interspersed with information about Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>The latter two were essentially just background characters.</p><p></p><p>This was a very normal situation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu were too young, and they were basically just cultivating within the Gu Family Manor, so they naturally didn't have much experience to speak of.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Yang, over the past half year, had been through a lot of hardships and tribulations. He was either on the path of recruiting troops, or attacking various strongholds and bandit nests, plundering resources from these Green Forest forces.</p><p></p><p>In common parlance,</p><p></p><p>It was a case of "black-on-black"! If it happened once or twice, it would be fine, but the more he did it, the more likely it was that he would attract attention.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng was not too worried about it, as he had entrusted the command of the hundred-man elite guard to Gu Yang, and the three elite guard commanders were all Refining Filth Realm experts. As long as no Patriarch-level experts interfered, there wouldn't be any major problems.</p><p></p><p>So although the information panel was refreshing frequently, and there were even occasional attacks from Washing Marrow Realm experts, Gu Yang had been navigating these challenges with ease so far.</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was not reckless in his actions.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this son of his, Gu Qingfeng had a sufficient understanding.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the Liuyun Stronghold,</p><p></p><p>The scene was now one of carnage, with bodies strewn everywhere. All the bandits had been slaughtered, and Gu Yang's clothes were stained with blood as he stood before Gu Yi, who was leading a group of elite guards.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>There was a person lying on the ground, their limbs twisted in a bizarre and unnatural way, as if they had been forcibly broken by brute strength.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at the person with an indifferent gaze and said calmly, "Tell me the purpose of your coming here, and I can make your death a quick one."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you've offended the Blood Spirit Sect, and you won't have a good end. You think you can get information out of me? Dream on!" the person spat out defiantly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression turned slightly cold.</p><p></p><p>He then looked over at Gu Yi.</p><p></p><p>"Have someone interrogate him thoroughly. I need to find out the relationship between the Blood Spirit Sect and the Liuyun Stronghold, and also who leaked our movements this time."</p><p></p><p>"As you command!" Gu Yi responded with a fist salute, and then gestured to the elite guards, who promptly dragged the person away.</p><p></p><p>Soon,</p><p></p><p>Agonizing screams could be heard from outside, lasting for half an incense stick's worth of time before finally subsiding. After another half incense stick's worth of time, the elite guard returned.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

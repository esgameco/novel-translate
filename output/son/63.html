        <h1>Chapter 63</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Suspected to be a Xiu Shu Boundary martial artist!"</p><p></p><p>"His origins are unclear. He established the Gu Family in Bai Shi City a decade ago, and has always maintained a low profile. But a few months ago, he successively annihilated the Qin Family Iron Bone Gang and other forces, unifying the entire Bai Shi Dao."</p><p></p><p>"And not long ago, he went to the Qing Yang Sect and slew the Qing Yang Patriarch—"</p><p></p><p>The intelligence regarding the Gu Family and Gu Qingfeng is now in Lu Wenxuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>Lu Wenxuan clenched his five fingers tightly, causing the paper to crumble into powder and dissipate.</p><p></p><p>At this time.</p><p></p><p>There was another person present in the study of the Zhen Xie司.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Guang Yang Prefecture hasn't seen a Xiu Shu Boundary martial artist for a long time. And according to the information, the Gu Family's patriarch is not that old, not even having reached the age of confusion, yet he has already stepped into the Xiu Shu Boundary.</p><p></p><p>With his natural talents, if he has the corresponding inheritance, he may have the possibility of stepping into the Lian Zang Boundary in the future.</p><p></p><p>Although the possibility of achieving Sect Master status is not great, as long as he can enter the Lian Zang Boundary, it would still be a significant boost."</p><p></p><p>The speaker was named Jiang Qin, a deputy commander of the Zhen Xie司 in Guang Yang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Lu Wenxuan's expression was indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"Trying to subdue this person is not easy. From the collected intelligence, we can see that this person has a lofty and arrogant character, and his methods are ruthless. He does not seem to be the type who would easily bow his head.</p><p></p><p>To make him serve our Zhen Xie司, it may not be that simple."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, no matter how strong he is, he is just a small Xiu Shu Boundary cultivator. Does he really think that by destroying the Qing Yang Sect, he can become invincible in this world?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin sneered, his face full of disdain.</p><p></p><p>"We have encountered martial artists with such proud spirits before. Whether it's through coercion or temptation, in the end, they still kneel down and become our dogs in the Zhen Xie司."</p><p></p><p>"The major sects and ancient families in the rivers and lakes are strict in their control of the pinnacle martial arts. If the Zhen Xie司has Lian Zang-level secret techniques, I don't believe he won't be tempted.</p><p></p><p>Even if this person is not moved by martial arts, the methods of Lian Xie Ru Ti, I believe no one can refuse."</p><p></p><p>At this point.</p><p></p><p>A cold light flashed in Jiang Qin's eyes, and a murderous aura appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"If the Gu Family is truly unwilling, then we'll just destroy them. This world ultimately belongs to the Shu Shi."</p><p></p><p>"He, a non-Shu Shi martial artist, has slain the Qing Yang Patriarch and destroyed the Qing Yang Sect. It seems that he has also incurred the dissatisfaction of many forces."</p><p></p><p>"Even if the Zhen Xie司directly takes action to eliminate the Gu Family, I don't believe anyone will say anything. If the Gu Family is destroyed, the territory previously under the Qing Yang Sect's control can also fall into the hands of our Zhen Xie司."</p><p></p><p>The Qing Yang Sect has stood in Guang Yang Prefecture for hundreds of years, and its influence is deeply rooted. If a force can be supported to take over the Qing Yang Sect's territory, that would be a good thing.</p><p></p><p>If the Qing Yang Sect was still in existence, the Zhen Xie司would not rashly take action.</p><p></p><p>After all, destroying the Qing Yang Sect is easy, but the troubles that come after its destruction are not small.</p><p></p><p>The Zhen Xie司is nominally under the control of the court, but in the current world, there is not just the voice of the court.</p><p></p><p>Many ancient families and sects, even the court, have to be wary of them.</p><p></p><p>The Qing Yang Sect is a Shu Shi sect. Touching one thread would mean moving the whole body.</p><p></p><p>With the Zhen Xie司's current status, they cannot act against the Qing Yang Sect without any reason.</p><p></p><p>But the Gu Family is different.</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family is a martial artist family, without any Shu Shi at its core.</p><p></p><p>In the current world, the Shu Shi are the true existences at the pinnacle. The so-called martial artists are just high and mighty in the eyes of ordinary people. In the face of true Shu Shi, martial artists are just a small matter.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>The Zhen Xie司cannot deal with the Gu Family without reason.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yángzōng, but dealing with a Gù family wouldn't be much of a problem.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lù Wénxuān pondered for a moment and then nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll leave this matter for you to handle. Moreover, the evil entity that disappeared in the vicinity of Lín County ten years ago also seems to be stirring. If we can find its whereabouts and subdue it, the Zhènxié司 (Bureau of Demon Suppression) can gain another powerful ally!"</p><p></p><p>"Has that evil entity's strength not fully recovered after all these years?"</p><p></p><p>Jiāng Qín's expression also became quite grave at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the Zhènxié司 had mobilized many powerful experts to deal with that evil entity, even resorting to sacrificing the lives of the residents of several counties to refine forbidden artifacts. Yet, the Zhènxié司 still suffered heavy losses.</p><p></p><p>It was a mutual destruction.</p><p></p><p>That was just the publicly circulated version.</p><p></p><p>In reality, almost all the powerful experts sent by the Zhènxié司 to subdue the evil entity had perished there. Only one commander at the Yùlíng (Commanding Spirits) realm was severely injured and managed to return to the Zhènxié司 with a forbidden artifact.</p><p></p><p>But not long after, that commander also perished, and the evil entity within him revived. Fortunately, he was suppressed by the experts of the Zhènxié司, preventing any further unrest.</p><p></p><p>Since then, the whereabouts of that evil entity had been lost.</p><p></p><p>The Zhènxié司 had searched extensively but found no results.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lù Wénxuān mentioned the evil entity's movements, Jiāng Qín was naturally shocked.</p><p></p><p>In its prime, that evil entity was a calamity-level existence, beyond the ability of Yùlíng-realm cultivators to contend with.</p><p></p><p>Lù Wénxuān said, "Although that evil entity was not sealed by the Zhènxié司 back then, it had suffered severe injuries. In recent years, it has been acting discreetly and there have been no reports of it engaging in large-scale slaughter.</p><p></p><p>Without the nourishment of human flesh and blood, the evil entity's recovery would be extremely limited.</p><p></p><p>If we can subdue it, it would be a great accomplishment!"</p><p></p><p>"According to the information we've received, that evil entity seems to be active in the vicinity of Qīngyáng Zōng. Since you're heading that way, you can try to investigate and gather some clues.</p><p></p><p>If you can find any information, that would be the best. If not, then so be it."</p><p></p><p>Lù Wénxuān's words faded.</p><p></p><p>Jiāng Qín nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>If he could recruit the Gù family to help search for the evil entity's whereabouts, that would be the best outcome. But if that's not possible, he could simply eliminate the Gù family and support another force to serve the Zhènxié司.</p><p></p><p>With Qīngyáng Zōng destroyed, the various factions have not yet intervened. As long as the Zhènxié司 acts quickly, they can seize control of Qīngyáng Zōng's territory.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, as the Zhènxié司 was making its move, many factions in Guǎngyáng Prefecture had their sights set on the Báishí Dào region.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the jianghu was in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>As for these matters, Gù Qīngfēng paid little attention.</p><p></p><p>He was currently focused on cultivating diligently, silently improving his own strength.</p><p></p><p>After the destruction of Qīngyáng Zōng, Gù Qīngfēng had gained many powerful martial arts, especially some extraordinary techniques for tempering the body. If he could fully master them, even if his cultivation couldn't break through, his strength would still advance significantly.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had broken through the Liàn Zāng (Refining Impurities) realm, Gù Qīngfēng's martial arts cultivation was no longer comparable to the past. Many profound martial arts that were once difficult for him to learn were now not much of a challenge.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to his obsessive nature, Gù Qīngfēng first spent several days fully cultivating the few low-grade martial arts he possessed, and then proceeded to practice the other advanced martial arts.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

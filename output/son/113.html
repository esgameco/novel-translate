        <h1>Chapter 113</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A single punch shattered the skull of one of the bandits, causing the remaining bandits to flee in terror, scattering like birds and beasts.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Peng did not completely pursue and eliminate them, allowing them to escape.</p><p></p><p>"In these chaotic times, ordinary people can barely survive!" </p><p></p><p>The Outer Hall Master sighed.</p><p></p><p>He had thought the situation in Guangyang Prefecture was already chaotic enough, but when he truly left Guangyang Prefecture, he realized that in comparison to the outside world, Guangyang Prefecture was already considered relatively stable.</p><p></p><p>Although there were still natural and man-made disasters, at least most people could still eat and were not caught up in the war.</p><p></p><p>However—</p><p></p><p>All of this was only temporary.</p><p></p><p>Once the rebel armies arrived, Guangyang Prefecture would inevitably end up the same as those other places.</p><p></p><p>In the carriage, Gu Qingfeng's expression was indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"The suffering of the common people, whether they thrive or perish, this world's order has already collapsed. If the root of the problem is not solved, no matter who rules the world, it will be the same!"</p><p></p><p>"Could the root that the Elder Master speaks of be referring to the Sorcerers?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng's expression changed, as if he had thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, but not entirely!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng first nodded, then shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"The existence of Sorcerers is indeed a major problem, but this world has already fallen ill, and the illness has penetrated deep. Only by scraping the bone and purging the poison is there a chance of a complete cure!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not continue.</p><p></p><p>No matter how much he said now, it would be useless.</p><p></p><p>To change this world, one must have sufficient strength.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the day,</p><p></p><p>This world still belongs to the strong.</p><p></p><p>The strong make the rules.</p><p></p><p>The weak can only survive.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, this world reveres the Sorcerers, and in the strict sense, those who have refined evil into their bodies can no longer be called human.</p><p></p><p>Such beings view ordinary people as livestock.</p><p></p><p>This,</p><p></p><p>Is the biggest problem.</p><p></p><p>—</p><p></p><p>The procession continued to advance.</p><p></p><p>In front of Gu Qingfeng was a report regarding the Shen Quan Sect.</p><p></p><p>He had already read this information dozens of times.</p><p></p><p>The Shen Quan Sect has a long historical foundation, tracing back to three thousand years ago, and there had even been True Meaning Sect Master-level experts emerge.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Three thousand years ago,</p><p></p><p>The world was also in turmoil, just like now.</p><p></p><p>That Sect Master of the Shen Quan Sect entered the chaotic world, wanting to use killing to attain the Dao, to explore the profound Sect Master realm.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately,</p><p></p><p>The other party ultimately failed, perishing in the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>Since then,</p><p></p><p>The Shen Quan Sect has declined.</p><p></p><p>Over the past thousands of years,</p><p></p><p>The Shen Quan Sect has become weaker and weaker. In the first one or two thousand years, the Shen Quan Sect still had Refine Impurity experts emerge, and there were even geniuses who rose up to become Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>But even though Sect Masters emerged, allowing the Shen Quan Sect to briefly revive, after that Sect Master's passing, the Shen Quan Sect declined once again.</p><p></p><p>Until now,</p><p></p><p>The Shen Quan Sect only has a few Refine Bone experts openly guarding it.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Shen Quan Golden Vajra, Xia Zong, is the top expert openly representing the Shen Quan Sect.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>In Gu Qingfeng's view, the foundation of the Shen Quan Sect is definitely not as simple as that.</p><p></p><p>"With three thousand years of sect heritage, even if it has declined, it shouldn't have declined to this extent!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng curiously asked, "Does the Elder Master think the Shen Quan Sect has other hidden experts?"</p><p></p><p>"As for that True Meaning Sect Master from three thousand years ago, I won't mention him for now, but the Sect Master who passed away a few hundred years ago is rather intriguing."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Sect Master experts, even if they are innate Sect Masters, can live for five hundred years.</p><p></p><p>If they are Qi and Blood Sect Masters, they can even live for eight hundred years.</p><p></p><p>More importantly,</p><p></p><p>Sect Masters!</p><p></p><p>At this level of strength, they are basically the top experts in the jianghu.</div></p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In this era where sorcerers are revered, it is simple for a master to extend their lifespan.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was suspicious.</p><p></p><p>The Shenquan Sect very likely had a sorcerer.</p><p></p><p>And the predecessor was a sorcerer who had achieved mastery.</p><p></p><p>A sorcerer of this level would undoubtedly be far more powerful than an ordinary sorcerer.</p><p></p><p>Additionally,</p><p></p><p>This possibility was not at all small.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Shenquan Sect has fallen into decline, but as a sect that once produced true master-level martial artists, it must be in possession of numerous top-tier martial arts.</p><p></p><p>If the Shenquan Sect was in its prime, it would be understandable. But now that the Shenquan Sect has declined, yet it still retains such profound foundations without other powers coveting it, this alone reveals many problems.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Peng's expression also became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, then the Shenquan Sect does have issues!"</p><p></p><p>Based on Gu Qingfeng's analysis, the Shenquan Sect's foundations are indeed not as simple as they appear on the surface.</p><p></p><p>A suspected master-level sorcerer.</p><p></p><p>Even if the other party is only at the Spirit Summoning realm, they would still be an extremely formidable existence.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p></p><p>A master is still a master.</p><p></p><p>This is undeniable.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the peak of the Purification of the Impurities Realm, Gu Peng understood the terrifying nature of masters even more.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Looking at the calm Gu Qingfeng before him, Gu Peng suppressed the slight trepidation in his heart.</p><p></p><p>So what if they are masters?</p><p></p><p>The one in front of him may not necessarily be someone he cannot deal with.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng waved his sleeve, and the scroll containing information about the Shenquan Sect instantly turned to ash and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes to meditate, preparing for the upcoming battle.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng did not dare to disturb him and quietly left the carriage.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two days later,</p><p></p><p>The advancing group stopped.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's tightly closed eyes opened, and a cold light seemed to flash, but it quickly subsided.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Elder Patriarch, the Shenquan Sect has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>Outside the carriage, Gu Peng respectfully said.</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the curtain was lifted, and Gu Qingfeng stepped out from the carriage.</p><p></p><p>In front of the carriage,</p><p></p><p>stood the mountain gate of the Shenquan Sect.</p><p></p><p>Now, the powerful experts of the vast Shenquan Sect had all gathered here, looking at the carriage with grave expressions.</p><p></p><p>On this trip, Gu Qingfeng did not deliberately hide his whereabouts, and the Shenquan Sect would have difficulty not noticing him.</p><p></p><p>The leader was none other than the current deputy sect master of the Shenquan Sect, Zhong Yang.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing Gu Qingfeng step out of the carriage, Zhong Yang's pupils slightly contracted, and then he spoke in a loud voice.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Shenquan Sect. Patriarch Gu, what is the purpose of your visit today?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not respond, but instead looked at the many Shenquan Sect warriors before him, finally shifting his gaze to Zhong Yang.</p><p></p><p>"The Shenquan Sect's sect master,季宗, killed the current patriarch of the Gu Clan. The Shenquan Sect must give an account of this matter."</p><p></p><p>His words,</p><p></p><p>caused Zhong Yang's expression to turn slightly unsightly: "Our Shenquan Sect's sect master has already perished at the hands of Patriarch Gu. This matter of enmity has now been resolved. What else does Patriarch Gu want the Shenquan Sect to account for?"</p><p></p><p>"That mere 季宗 is not even worthy of being mentioned alongside my son. He deserved to die for daring to act against us. But the Shenquan Sect must also pay the price!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sneered disdainfully, and although his words were calm, they carried a mocking tone that reached Zhong Yang and the others.</p><p></p><p>Instantly,</p><p></p><p>Zhong Yang was enraged.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch Gu, your actions are a bit too tyrannical, don't you think!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you truly believe the Shenquan Sect has no one to defend it?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Gu Qingfeng suddenly laughed.</p><p></p><p>"So what if I'm tyrannical? Since you refuse to give an account, then the Shenquan Sect no longer has a reason to exist."</p><p></p><p>Saying this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression turned icy cold, and he waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

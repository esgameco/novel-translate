        <h1>Chapter 113</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A single punch shattered the skull of one of the bandits, causing the remaining bandits to panic and flee in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Peng did not completely pursue and eliminate them, allowing them to escape.</p><p></p><p>"In these turbulent times, ordinary people can barely survive!" </p><p></p><p>The Outer Hall Master sighed.</p><p></p><p>He had thought the situation in Guangyang Prefecture was chaotic enough, but when he truly left Guangyang Prefecture, he realized that in comparison to the outside world, Guangyang Prefecture was already considered relatively stable.</p><p></p><p>Although there were still natural and man-made disasters, at least most people could still eat and were not embroiled in the war.</p><p></p><p>However—</p><p></p><p>All of this was only temporary.</p><p></p><p>Once the rebel armies arrived, Guangyang Prefecture would inevitably end up like those other places.</p><p></p><p>In the carriage, Gu Qingfeng's expression was indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"The suffering of the common people, whether they thrive or perish, this world's order has already collapsed. If the root of the problem is not solved, no matter who rules the world, it will be the same!"</p><p></p><p>"Could the root that the Elder Master speaks of be referring to the Sorcerers?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng's expression changed, as if he had thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, but not entirely!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng first nodded, then shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"The existence of Sorcerers is indeed a major problem, but this world has already fallen ill, and the disease has penetrated deep. Only by scraping the bone and purging the poison is there a chance of a complete cure!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not continue.</p><p></p><p>No matter how much he said now, it would be useless.</p><p></p><p>To change this world, one must have sufficient strength.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the day,</p><p></p><p>this world still belongs to the strong.</p><p></p><p>The strong make the rules.</p><p></p><p>The weak can only survive.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, this world reveres the Sorcerers, and in the strict sense, those who have integrated evil into their bodies can no longer be called human.</p><p></p><p>Such beings view ordinary people as livestock.</p><p></p><p>This,</p><p></p><p>is the biggest problem.</p><p></p><p>—</p><p></p><p>The procession continued to advance.</p><p></p><p>In front of Gu Qingfeng was a report on the Divine Fist Sect.</p><p></p><p>He had already read this information dozens of times.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Fist Sect has a long historical foundation, even traceable back three thousand years, and there were once True Meaning Sect Master-level experts.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>three thousand years ago,</p><p></p><p>the world was also in turmoil, just like now.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Divine Fist Sect entered the chaotic world, wanting to use killing to attain the Dao, to explore the profound realm of the Great Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately,</p><p></p><p>the other party ultimately failed, perishing in the great calamity.</p><p></p><p>Since then,</p><p></p><p>the Divine Fist Sect has declined.</p><p></p><p>Over the past thousands of years,</p><p></p><p>the Divine Fist Sect has become weaker and weaker. In the first one or two thousand years, the Divine Fist Sect still had Refining Impurity experts emerge, and there were even geniuses who rose up to become Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>But even though Sect Masters emerged, briefly reviving the Divine Fist Sect, after that Sect Master's passing, the Divine Fist Sect once again fell into decline.</p><p></p><p>Until now,</p><p></p><p>the Divine Fist Sect only has a few Refining Bone experts openly guarding it.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Divine Fist Vajra, Siji, is the top expert openly representing the Divine Fist Sect.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>in Gu Qingfeng's view, the foundation of the Divine Fist Sect is definitely not as simple as that.</p><p></p><p>"With three thousand years of sect heritage, even if it has declined, it shouldn't have declined to this extent!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng curiously asked, "Does the Elder Master think the Divine Fist Sect has other powerful experts hidden?"</p><p></p><p>"As for the True Meaning Sect Master from three thousand years ago, let's not talk about that for now, but the Sect Master who passed away a few hundred years ago is rather intriguing."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Sect Master experts, even if they are Innate Sect Masters, can live for five hundred years.</p><p></p><p>If they are Qi and Blood Sect Masters, they can even live for eight hundred years.</p><p></p><p>More importantly,</p><p></p><p>Sect Masters!</p><p></p><p>This level of expert is basically the top martial artists in the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In this era where sorcerers are revered, it is simple for a master to extend their lifespan.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was suspicious.</p><p></p><p>The Shenquan Sect very likely had a sorcerer.</p><p></p><p>And this sorcerer was once a master.</p><p></p><p>A sorcerer of this level would undoubtedly be much more powerful than an ordinary sorcerer.</p><p></p><p>Additionally,</p><p></p><p>This possibility was not small at all.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Shenquan Sect has fallen, but as a sect that once produced true masters, it must have mastered many top-tier martial arts.</p><p></p><p>If the Shenquan Sect was in its prime, it would be understandable. But now that the Shenquan Sect has declined, yet it still retains such profound knowledge without other powers coveting it, this alone can explain many issues.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Peng's expression also became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, the Shenquan Sect does have problems!"</p><p></p><p>Based on Gu Qingfeng's analysis, the foundation of the Shenquan Sect is indeed not as simple as it appears on the surface.</p><p></p><p>A suspected master-level sorcerer.</p><p></p><p>Even if the other party is only at the Spirit Controlling realm, they are an extremely formidable existence.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p></p><p>A master is a master.</p><p></p><p>This is undeniable.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the Purified Essence Realm, Gu Peng understood the terrifying nature of masters even more.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Looking at the calm Gu Qingfeng in front of him, Gu Peng suppressed the slight trepidation in his heart.</p><p></p><p>So what if they are masters?</p><p></p><p>The person in front of him may not necessarily be someone he cannot deal with.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng waved his sleeve, and the scroll containing information about the Shenquan Sect instantly turned to ash.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes to cultivate, preparing for the upcoming battle.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng did not dare to disturb him and quietly left the carriage.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two days later,</p><p></p><p>The advancing team stopped.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's tightly closed eyes opened, and a cold light seemed to flash, but it quickly subsided.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Elder Patriarch, the Shenquan Sect has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>Outside the carriage, Gu Peng respectfully said.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, the curtain was lifted, and Gu Qingfeng came out from inside.</p><p></p><p>In front of the carriage,</p><p></p><p>stood the mountain gate of the Shenquan Sect.</p><p></p><p>Now, the powerful figures of the vast Shenquan Sect all appeared here, looking at the carriage with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>This time, Gu Qingfeng did not deliberately hide his whereabouts, and the Shenquan Sect would have difficulty not noticing him.</p><p></p><p>The leader was none other than the current deputy sect master of the Shenquan Sect, Zhong Yang.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing Gu Qingfeng come out of the carriage, Zhong Yang's pupils slightly contracted, and then he spoke in a loud voice.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Shenquan Sect. Patriarch Gu, what is the purpose of your visit today?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not respond, but instead looked at the many Shenquan Sect warriors in front of him, and finally focused his gaze on Zhong Yang.</p><p></p><p>"The Shenquan Sect's sect master,季 Zong, killed the current patriarch of the Gu family. The Shenquan Sect must give an account of this matter."</p><p></p><p>His words,</p><p></p><p>made Zhong Yang's expression slightly unsightly: "Our Shenquan Sect's sect master has already perished at the hands of Patriarch Gu. This enmity has now been resolved. What else does Patriarch Gu want our Shenquan Sect to account for?"</p><p></p><p>"That 季 Zong is not even worthy to be mentioned alongside my son. He deserved to die for daring to act against us. But the Shenquan Sect must also pay the price!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sneered contemptuously, and his words, though calm, were filled with a mocking tone in the ears of Zhong Yang and the others.</p><p></p><p>Immediately,</p><p></p><p>Zhong Yang was enraged.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch Gu, your actions are a bit too overbearing, aren't they!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you really think the Shenquan Sect has no one to defend it?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Gu Qingfeng suddenly laughed.</p><p></p><p>"So what if I'm overbearing? Since you refuse to give an account, then the Shenquan Sect no longer needs to exist."</p><p></p><p>Saying this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression turned icy cold, and he waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 128</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The reason for doing this is because there are two more profound changes in the viscera that require a breakthrough in the Prajna Sutra, but the latter breakthrough is as difficult as ascending to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>So, rather than wasting energy on cultivation, it is better to turn back and thoroughly integrate what one has learned, and see if one can combine it with one's own to create a perfect martial art.</p><p></p><p>Even if one cannot create a truly complete and perfect martial art, having a prototype would still be not bad.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, when it comes to the Scarlet Flame Divine Skill, Gu Qingfeng also has no need to cultivate it further.</p><p></p><p>Having reached the ninth level of perfection, the true qi generates itself naturally. Now, he only needs to wait for enough time, and the Scarlet Flame Divine Skill will naturally breakthrough to the tenth level, allowing him to attain the status of a Transcendent Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts created by the ancients were either based on observing the natural world, or on learning from the martial arts of predecessors, and then integrating one's own unique insights. Only in this way can one create a martial art of one's own!"</p><p></p><p>"I have now cultivated various martial arts, and I do have the foundation to create my own martial art!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's mind gradually calmed down, and he began to systematically organize what he had learned, and then verify the perfect physical body he had cultivated, and set about exploring the so-called perfect martial art.</p><p></p><p>The idea was beautiful, but the reality was cruel.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng actually started to explore the creation of a completely new martial art, he realized just how difficult it was.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng had enough time, as a lifespan of 1,200 years was already considered immortality in the eyes of many.</p><p></p><p>Since he had enough time, he could ponder and research it slowly until he succeeded.</p><p></p><p>While Gu Qingfeng was secluded in his cultivation to create a new martial art, the situation in the world was also changing unpredictably.</p><p></p><p>First, the Martial King Pei Jing led his troops to openly attack Guangyang Prefecture. Although the Guangyang Prefecture immediately responded with imperial forces, Pei Jing's forces were too powerful, and with the help of experts from the Celestial Yang Sword Sect, the Guangyang Prefecture forces were forced to retreat.</p><p></p><p>As the imperial troops were defeated, the Martial Army advanced directly, and the vast Guangyang Prefecture fell into complete chaos.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was the first to know of these changes.</p><p></p><p>In the government office of White Stone City, Gu Yang sat in the main seat, with the prefect of the city, Mu Qing, and other officials of the White Stone Dao below him.</p><p></p><p>"Master Gu, three days ago the imperial troops were defeated, and now the Martial Army is coming in force. I've heard that Pei Jing is leading an army of 100,000 troops towards the White Stone Dao. Their intention is obvious.</p><p></p><p>If we don't respond to this, the consequences will be unimaginable!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Qing spoke very tactfully. The rest of the people actually understood that after the Martial Army had crushed the imperial troops, they would immediately send troops to the White Stone Dao, because of the Gu family manor.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the White Stone Dao was insignificant within Guangyang Prefecture, and Pei Jing would not have targeted it first.</p><p></p><p>But these words, although they could be thought, could not be spoken out loud.</p><p></p><p>It was simple. The White Stone Dao now belonged to the Gu family, and they all took orders from the Gu family manor.</p><p></p><p>Although the Martial Army seemed unstoppable, the Gu family manor was not without its own foundations. If it really came to a battle, the outcome would be uncertain.</p><p></p><p>This was also why these people had not directly defected to the Martial Army or abandoned the White Stone Dao.</p><p></p><p>If there was truly no hope, they would have fled faster than anyone else.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>These people were well aware of this, and Gu Yang was also fully aware of it.</p><p></p><p>He had not expected these court officials to be so loyal to him, and it could be said that every single one of the court officials present here was someone who valued their own lives and was greedy for benefits.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they would not have been willing to submit and obey.</p><p></p><p>"The issue with the Divine Martial Army need not be worried about, my Gu Family Manor is not entirely without foundation. A mere hundred thousand troops wanting to take down the White Stone Path is simply a pipe dream."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, I will report this matter to my father. Even if our troops are truly no match for them, as long as my father is willing to step in, I believe resolving the problem would not be difficult."</p><p></p><p>When Gu Yang said this, he immediately changed the tone of his words.</p><p></p><p>His words caused everyone present to be stunned, and an expression of awe involuntarily appeared on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's father was the Tyrant Saber Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>The rumors in the jianghu were that this person's strength was already comparable to that of a top-tier True Meaning Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>The reason they were willing to obey Gu Yang was that the one standing behind him was a top-tier powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>In this era where great masters rarely emerged, a top-tier True Meaning Sect Master could be considered an invincible powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>Even if the world revered sorcerers, the sorcerer experts who could truly contend with a top-tier True Meaning Sect Master were few and far between.</p><p></p><p>If it were someone who had just been exposed to the true nature of this world, any sorcerer would be completely undefeatable in the eyes of martial artists, who would be mere insects.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, as court officials, they had a more thorough understanding of sorcerers.</p><p></p><p>It is true that sorcerers are powerful.</p><p></p><p>But it is relative.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary martial artists, sorcerers are undefeatable existences, even the weakest sorcerer can be on par with Blood Refining Realm martial artists.</p><p></p><p>However, the so-called ordinary martial artists naturally do not include the top-tier True Meaning Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, someone said, "If Senior Tyrant Saber is willing to lend a hand, the problem would not be too great."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you all continue to keep an eye on the Divine Martial Army's movements, and report any news to me immediately!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Gu Yang stood up and left with a few bodyguards.</p><p></p><p>After he left, the people in the government office had a subtle change in their expressions.</p><p></p><p>One of them looked at Mu Qing and said in a deep voice, "Master Mu, now that the Divine Martial Army is approaching so aggressively, do we really have to stand on the same boat as the Gu Family Manor?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the expressions of the others became even more uncertain.</p><p></p><p>Mu Qing said indifferently, "If we don't stand with the Gu Family Manor, do we have any other choices?"</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention the current chaotic situation, just the fact that the Tyrant Saber stands behind the Gu Family Manor is something we cannot offend."</p><p></p><p>"The terribleness of a top-tier True Meaning Sect Master is beyond your imagination. As long as that person is alive, the Gu Family Manor will not truly perish."</p><p></p><p>"And even if Pei Jing can truly take down the White Stone Path, what of it? Without the absolute certainty of being able to kill Gu Qingfeng, he would never dare to do anything to the Gu Family Manor."</p><p></p><p>"The mighty Divine Martial King cannot be offended, so how can you think that we can offend him?"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Mu Qing's expression carried a mocking tone.</p><p></p><p>Whether the Divine Martial Army lives or dies is still uncertain, but if they offend a True Meaning Sect Master, that would be a sure path to death.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Tyrant Saber is willing, killing them would be as easy as turning over one's hand, and they would have no chance of survival in heaven or on earth.</p><p></p><p>Mu Qing's words caused those who had harbored other ideas to turn pale, directly abandoning the thoughts that had briefly emerged in their minds.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

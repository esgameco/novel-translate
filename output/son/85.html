        <h1>Chapter 85</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It is almost the pinnacle existence of a calamity-level evil entity.</p><p></p><p>The most powerful calamity-level evil entity is one that can contend with a grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>But the evil entities that can be on par with the Refiner of Filth are also extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>As for going further up.</p><p></p><p>The disaster-level evil entities.</p><p></p><p>Those are already the existence that can condense the forbidden area.</p><p></p><p>As Jiang Qin said, only the legendary great grandmasters can deal with the disaster-level evil entities.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Since ancient times, great grandmaster powerhouses have been rare, appearing only once in a century.</p><p></p><p>From this, we can see again that the upper limit of the martial dao in this world is indeed not high.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the top experts in the open are barely able to deal with the powerful calamity-level evil entities, the disaster-level ones are almost impossible to contend with.</p><p></p><p>Only the Warlocks.</p><p></p><p>Can truly master such powerful forces.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's martial dao heart is still firm.</p><p></p><p>And then.</p><p></p><p>There is the Scarlet Flame Divine Technique.</p><p></p><p>After carefully pondering this martial art for a long time, a pensive expression appeared in Gu Qingfeng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Scarlet Flame Divine Technique!"</p><p></p><p>"The one who created this technique must be extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>This is an unparalleled technique that directly points to the perfection of the Refiner of Filth realm.</p><p></p><p>But unlike the Five Viscera Classic, the Scarlet Flame Divine Technique is not just a cultivation method at the Refiner of Filth level, but has a complete system from refining the skin, to later refining the blood, bones, marrow, and Refiner of Filth.</p><p></p><p>This unparalleled technique is divided into nine layers.</p><p></p><p>The first four layers.</p><p></p><p>Correspond to the four realms of refining the skin and marrow cleansing.</p><p></p><p>The last five layers.</p><p></p><p>Correspond to the five realms of refining the Filth.</p><p></p><p>When the nine layers are perfected.</p><p></p><p>The divine technique will be fully mastered.</p><p></p><p>And in the last records of the Scarlet Flame Divine Technique, there is theoretically a tenth layer, which is the perfection of the divine technique where the true qi self-generates.</p><p></p><p>At that time.</p><p></p><p>The martial artist can directly achieve the realm of the Innate Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately.</p><p></p><p>The powerful cultivator who created this Scarlet Flame Divine Technique only gained this enlightenment when he was about to pass away, so although he perfected the nine layers, he did not live to see the true qi self-generation.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking.</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Flame Divine Technique is not a transcendent martial art, but a top-tier martial art that directly points to the Innate Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>"Grandmaster martial art!"</p><p></p><p>"This is a great surprise for me!"</p><p></p><p>An unstoppable smile appeared on Gu Qingfeng's face.</p><p></p><p>If all goes well.</p><p></p><p>Once he perfects the nine layers, he will have the opportunity to break through to the tenth layer of the Scarlet Flame Divine Technique, directly stepping into the Innate Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng believes that such an unparalleled technique that points directly to the Grandmaster realm is invaluable no matter where it is.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Even with such an inheritance, Wen Jiao still chose to refine the evil entities into his body.</p><p></p><p>This also indirectly shows that the cultivation of the Scarlet Flame Divine Technique is arduous, and to truly perfect the nine layers, have the true qi self-generate, and step into the tenth layer to attain the Innate Grandmaster, is not a simple task.</p><p></p><p>But these are not big problems for Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>What he currently lacks is a truly complete martial dao system.</p><p></p><p>After all, without a complete martial dao system, the consumption will increase exponentially when trying to break through the limits.</p><p></p><p>With the Scarlet Flame Divine Technique at hand, this problem can be temporarily ignored before stepping into the Innate Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng didn't even expect that Wen Jiao could bring him such a surprise.</p><p></p><p>Relying on this.</p><p></p><p>Wen Jiao's death is not undeserved.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>On the White Stone City.</p><p></p><p>Wen Jiao's body was hung up, immediately attracting many onlookers, even the officials were alerted.</p><p></p><p>But upon learning that this was the doing of the Gu Family Village, the officials simply turned a blind eye.</p><p></p><p>At the government office.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Inside.</p><p></p><p>Prefect Mu Qing listened to the report from his subordinates, his face also showing signs of shock.</p><p></p><p>"Are you certain that the body at the city gate is that of a high-level expert from the Crimson Flame Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"That's correct. Based on the appearance, the person seems to be Wen Jiao, the Peak Master of the Crimson Flame Peak of the Crimson Flame Sect. He was a small sect master at the Refining Impurity Realm hundreds of years ago. </p><p></p><p>Since he has become an Adept, his strength is likely even more unfathomable!"</p><p></p><p>The secretary nodded, and as he spoke, an expression of awe and lament appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that I never expected such a powerful expert to have fallen at the hands of that person from the Gu Family Manor. That person's strength is likely even more terrifying than the rumors!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Mu Qing's expression fluctuated.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the change in his expression, the secretary carefully asked, "Your Excellency, should we take the body down? Otherwise, leaving the body hanging there, the Crimson Flame Sect may not let this go easily!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, why should we take it down? The one who killed him is from the Gu Family Manor, what does it have to do with our government office? Even if the Crimson Flame Sect wants to vent their anger on us, the court is not to be trifled with.</p><p></p><p>Although the Crimson Flame Sect is powerful, they have not yet reached the point of being able to openly defy the court!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Qing sneered.</p><p></p><p>Although the current world is in chaos, and the court's prestige has greatly diminished, it is not something that any sect can easily offend.</p><p></p><p>Even though, many times, the forces of the jianghu seem to completely ignore the existence of the government offices, treating them as mere ornaments.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>Being an ornament is one thing.</p><p>Daring to take action is another.</p><p></p><p>A dying camel is still bigger than a horse.</p><p>If they really want to tear off the facade, the court suppressing a Crimson Flame Sect would be a simple matter.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p>Mu Qing was not at all afraid of the Crimson Flame Sect blaming him.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover—"</p><p></p><p>"The Gu Family Manor has been suppressing various disturbances in this period, allowing White Stone City to finally regain stability. If we take down Wen Jiao's body, wouldn't that offend the Gu Family Manor?</p><p></p><p>So the matters of the jianghu should be left for the jianghu people to resolve.</p><p>As for us, there is no need to get involved in so much."</p><p></p><p>Mu Qing picked up the teacup and took a sip, saying leisurely.</p><p></p><p>He has now completely laid back. As long as there is no major upheaval, that's fine.</p><p></p><p>Other Adept sects and powerful families are often brutal, frequently massacring the common people, causing widespread resentment. In contrast, forces like the Gu Family Manor, which are purely martial, have relatively fewer problems.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Mu Qing has also seen the actions of the Gu Family Manor in this period.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the disturbances!</p><p>This is the difference between having a powerful jianghu force stationed and not having one.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Mu Qing had seen the potential in Gu Qingfeng, and had opened many conveniences for the Gu family's actions, including now being very courteous to the Gu Family Manor in various aspects.</p><p></p><p>Fundamentally,</p><p>the reason lies here.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Mu Qing's words, the others also nodded in deep agreement.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>While the government office was indifferently watching from the sidelines, the news of Wen Jiao's death had, in just a few days, spread throughout the entire Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p>Even beyond Guangyang Prefecture, many forces had also heard of it.</p><p></p><p>Whenever they learned of this news, many powerful experts were greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Slaying Wen Jiao!</p><p>That is a completely different concept from instantly killing Wen Jiao with a single sword strike!</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p>in a short time,</p><p>the name of the Gu Family Manor, as well as the three words "Gu Qingfeng", had spread far and wide, the latter especially having the momentum of becoming a renowned figure in the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>Because of this,</p><p>some even gave Gu Qingfeng a nickname.</p><p>That is—the Overlord Saber!</p><p>Overlord Saber Gu Qingfeng! And as Gu Qingfeng's reputation spread,</p><p>within the Crimson Flame Sect,</p><p>the atmosphere was oppressive.</p><p>The expressions of many powerful sect members were constantly changing, showing both shock and barely concealed fury.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

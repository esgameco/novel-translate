        <h1>Chapter 46</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Is this true!?"</p><p></p><p>"I, your father, never speak false words!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng slowly walked to the center of the courtyard, looking at Gu Yang in front of him, and said calmly:</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead, you only have three chances to strike!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, then I shall offend you—"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang also wanted to verify his own strength after breaking through the Refine Blood Realm, and how much of a gap there was between him and Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Qingfeng standing still, Gu Yang took a deep breath, mobilizing the power of his blood and qi, as if a blood mist was spreading, already showing the initial form of a blood and qi conflagration.</p><p></p><p>"Father, be careful!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Gu Yang stepped forward, his entire body twisting together, and he struck out with a punch like a collapsing mountain, the fierce momentum of which made Gu Qingfeng nod slightly.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's cultivation time in the Gu Family Fist was not too long, yet he had already grasped the essence of this martial art.</p><p></p><p>This punch.</p><p></p><p>Clearly showed that he had already comprehended the divine rhythm of the martial art itself.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's blood and qi transformed into a powerful qi, and when Gu Yang's punch landed on the qi, it was like hitting an extremely solid steel plate, the powerful recoil force making him involuntarily retreat several steps, his blood and qi surging unabated.</p><p></p><p>This scene.</p><p></p><p>Shocked Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>He was well aware of the huge gap between himself and Gu Qingfeng, but he didn't expect the gap to be so great.</p><p></p><p>Even though he didn't use his full strength in that punch, he still couldn't break through Gu Qingfeng's blood and qi defense.</p><p></p><p>"The first move!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stood with his hands behind his back, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang took a deep breath and immediately struck again.</p><p></p><p>This time.</p><p></p><p>He held nothing back.</p><p></p><p>An even stronger punch came crashing in, but it still failed to break through the defense of the blood and qi, and instead was injured by the powerful force.</p><p></p><p>At that moment.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang suppressed the surging blood and qi, and struck out with a palm again, the powerful force causing the air to suddenly explode, as if a scorching aura accompanied it, the fierce and domineering palm heavily landing on the blood and qi.</p><p></p><p>In the next breath.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's body trembled, and the blood and qi exploded, the terrifying impact force instantly sending Gu Yang flying.</p><p></p><p>In midair, Gu Yang barely stabilized his body, and after landing, he still couldn't stop his body, having to retreat several steps before finally coming to a stop.</p><p></p><p>"How was it?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had a faint smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's face alternated between pale and red, and he finally lowered his head and said, "Father's cultivation is profound, and I am not worthy."</p><p></p><p>"My strength in the jianghu is not considered top-tier, and if you can't even break through my blood and qi, how can you have the qualifications to disregard everyone in the world?</p><p></p><p>The White Stone Dao may be small, but how do you know that the seemingly ordinary people are not hidden masters?</p><p></p><p>If you are always arrogant and conceited, you will only reap the consequences of your own actions.</p><p></p><p>Recognize your own strength, only then can you walk a long path!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng admonished sternly.</p><p></p><p>"When I first came to the White Stone Dao, if I had acted like you, how could the Gu Family have reached today's status?</p><p></p><p>So before your strength is sufficient, you must learn to be low-key and hibernate, and only when your strength is strong enough can you truly disregard everything!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Gu Qingfeng's voice softened a bit.</p><p></p><p>"But your talent to enter the Refine Blood Realm at your age is indeed excellent. Cultivate well, and one day when you break through the Refine Bone Realm or even higher, you may not be completely without a chance."</p><p></p><p>"When I'm gone, the Gu Family will still need you to preside over the situation!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng gave Gu Yang both a stick and a carrot, making his dejected face look much better.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, Father!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, you understand that's best. Well, there are some Refine Blood Pills here, just right for you to consolidate the foundation you just broke through. Go on and cultivate!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng casually handed over eighty Refine Blood Pills.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Anyway, Gu Yang no longer needed this kind of elixir. Although the effect was greatly reduced when Gu Yang broke through the Blood Refining Realm, it was still not bad. Regarding this, Gu Yang felt increasingly moved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng then began to continue his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Although his cultivation had broken through the Marrow Cleansing Realm, there were always people above him, so Gu Qingfeng naturally would not be arrogant and complacent.</p><p></p><p>That Saintly Martial King Pei Jing was at least an expert at the Refining Impurity Realm level, and might have even stepped into the Patriarch realm.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, Pei Jing also had many powerful subordinates under him.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Yang Sword Sect was renowned, and it had countless powerful experts within.</p><p></p><p>Facing such a force, the mere Marrow Cleansing Realm was still a little lacking.</p><p></p><p>In the Guangyang Prefecture, in the rear mountain of the Qingyang Sect, a certain cave dwelling, there came the piercing cries and wails, as if many people had seen something terrifying.</p><p></p><p>This kind of agonizing cry only lasted for a moment before abruptly stopping.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, there was only the slow chewing sound echoing in the dark cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Outside the cave dwelling, the Sect Master of the Qingyang Sect, Ye Nanqiu, had a calm expression, as if he was accustomed to all of this.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the chewing sound stopped.</p><p></p><p>A vigorous voice then came from inside the cave dwelling, "Come in!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Nanqiu walked into the cave dwelling. The previously dim cave dwelling had now become much brighter. On the cave walls, there were large amounts of fresh blood splattered, and on the ground were more than a dozen blood-stained fresh skeletons.</p><p></p><p>If one looked closely, they would find that these skeletons were all very young.</p><p></p><p>At the deepest part of the cave dwelling, there was a Taoist priest in blue robes sitting there. His face was aged, with remnants of fresh blood at the corners of his mouth. Suddenly, he extended his scarlet tongue and licked the blood at the corners of his mouth, revealing a sinister smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple pays respects to the Venerable Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, I am about to break through. Now I need three thousand young boys and girls. You must immediately arrange for the Qin family's people to handle this matter!"</p><p></p><p>When mentioning the three thousand young boys and girls, a faint green glow flickered in the Qingyang Ancestor's eyes, appearing particularly sinister in this cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nanqiu said, "Reporting to the Venerable Ancestor, there has been news that a mysterious expert named Gu Qingfeng has appeared in the Baishi Dao, who single-handedly destroyed the Qin family, the Iron Bone Gang, and the Tian Yun Sect, becoming the overlord of the Baishi Dao jianghu."</p><p></p><p>"The Qin family has been destroyed?" The Qingyang Ancestor's eyes turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of strength does this Gu family have, do you know?"</p><p></p><p>"It is said that Gu Qingfeng's cultivation has already reached the Half-step Refining Bone Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Half-step Refining Bone—" The Qingyang Ancestor nodded slightly. If his cultivation was at that level, he indeed had the potential to unify the entire Baishi Dao.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the Qingyang Ancestor coldly chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"The Qin family was also a bunch of useless people. They have been supported by my Qingyang Sect for so many years, but they still couldn't unify the entire Baishi Dao. Such a waste of a family clan being destroyed is no big deal.</p><p></p><p>But no matter who is in charge of the Baishi Dao now, they must still listen to my Qingyang Sect.</p><p></p><p>Since the Gu family is now in control of the Baishi Dao, you send people over there and tell the Gu family to prepare three thousand young boys and girls within a month. If there is even the slightest mistake, they will have to provide people from the Gu family to make up for it.</p><p></p><p>I believe that the flavor of a Half-step Refining Bone Realm cultivator will be much better than ordinary young boys and girls!"</p>

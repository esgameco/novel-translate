        <h1>Chapter 216</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The most ancient immortal body in the heavens and earth!</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng took out all the ancient immortal bodies from his item storage, this was the only information that appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"The most ancient immortal body in the heavens and earth?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the drop of blood in front of him, containing the ancient aura of countless years, completely different from the blood he had obtained by slaying the evil Buddha before.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Gu Qingfeng directly swallowed this drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>The blood entered his abdomen, and in an instant, it stirred up towering waves within his physical body.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng only felt an extremely powerful force cleansing his physique.</p><p></p><p>Blood! Bones! Meridians! Everything was undergoing a terrifying transformation.</p><p></p><p>At some unknown time, there had suddenly appeared a terrifying celestial anomaly in the heavens and earth, as if a majestic figure had stood upright in the nine heavens, causing the mountains and rivers to tremble, the void to shatter, and the sun and moon to dim.</p><p></p><p>Various great Dao essences intertwined, forming ancient totems, and the mighty celestial power descended, causing everyone to change their expressions.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Gu Yang had established the Divine Martial Dynasty, triggering a celestial anomaly, and now another mysterious anomaly had appeared, and its momentum was even more astonishing than the one during the founding of the dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Among all the people, only Gu Yang could maintain his composure.</p><p></p><p>He held the destiny of an entire dynasty.</p><p></p><p>He could discern that the source of this anomaly was from within the royal palace.</p><p></p><p>And in the entire royal palace, there was only one person who could trigger such a celestial anomaly.</p><p></p><p>"Father!" Gu Yang's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>Such a terrifying celestial anomaly, if it had been triggered by anyone else, he would not have been able to remain so calm.</p><p></p><p>However, this celestial anomaly came and went quickly.</p><p></p><p>In less than half an hour, the celestial anomaly dissipated, but the terrifying aura still lingered, causing everyone to feel a sense of dread.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the royal palace, Gu Qingfeng finally regained consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the appearance of such a celestial anomaly, he was also somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect the appearance of the ancient immortal body to trigger such a powerful celestial anomaly, but this also indirectly proves that the ancient immortal body is truly extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>Although his cultivation level had not made any breakthrough, Gu Qingfeng could truly feel that his strength was more than doubled compared to before he obtained the ancient immortal body.</p><p></p><p>His physical body and constitution had reached a terrifying level.</p><p></p><p>With a simple punch, the space in front of him instantly cracked like a spider web.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the shattered space gradually healed, and in less than a moment, it had completely recovered.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss!" Seeing this, Gu Qingfeng couldn't help but take a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Breaking the void, he could certainly do it with his full strength. But that punch just now was done casually, without exerting much power.</p><p></p><p>Yet, it was still able to shatter the void.</p><p></p><p>This showed the extraordinary nature of the ancient immortal body.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Gu Qingfeng directly secluded himself in the royal palace, while Gu Yang was handling the subsequent matters of establishing the dynasty.</p><p></p><p>After all, the founding of the dynasty was just the beginning. There were still many things that needed to be dealt with, such as enfeoffing the officials and stabilizing the situation in the Nine Provinces, as the Divine Martial Dynasty had just been established, and everything was in a state of disrepair and needed to be gradually addressed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Phew!" In the secret chamber, Gu Qingfeng let out a long sigh, his eyes shining with brilliance.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the ancient immortal body, he found that his innate talent and constitution had undergone tremendous changes. What had previously been arduous cultivation had now become completely different.</p><p></p><p>In just a few days, Gu Qingfeng felt that his cultivation of the Eighteen-Zhang Golden Body had become much easier, and it would not take long for him to break through to the seventh layer on his own.</p><p></p><p>This was a situation he had never experienced before.</p><p></p><p>He had always been aware of his dull innate talent, but now, with the appearance of the ancient immortal body, his talent had transformed into an extremely powerful one.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were no cultivation points, Gu Qingfeng could still rely on the ancient immortal body to ascend to higher realms.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the combination of the ancient immortal body and the cultivation points, Gu Qingfeng could hardly imagine how far he could go.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that the achievement of Gu Yang in establishing the dynasty would bring the greatest benefit in the form of cultivation points, but now it seemed that the greatest benefit was not the cultivation points or the medicinal pills, but the ancient immortal body in the end.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng looked at his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng  Age: 51/3000  Realm: Perfected Dao Master</p><p></p><p>Martial Arts: Heaven Thunder Sword Technique (Beginner), Prajna Sutra (13th Layer Perfected, 12th Level Prajna True Body), Heavenly Vein Classic (2nd Layer), Longevity Technique (Perfected, 5th Level Longevity), Pure Yang True Body (Perfected, 4th Level Flesh Body Purity), Heavenly Saber (Perfected, 1st Level Heavenly Saber Realm), Blood Refining Classic (Perfected, 8th Level Divine Blood), Divine Movement Hundred Changes (Perfected, 4th Level Divine Speed), Eighteen-Zhang Golden Body (6th Layer, 6th Level Golden Body)</p><p></p><p>Cultivation Points: 5,302...</p><p></p><p>"Five thousand three hundred and two!" When Gu Qingfeng truly saw so many cultivation points, his pupils couldn't help but constrict.</p><p></p><p>Five thousand three hundred cultivation points. If he were to fully convert them into his own strength, Gu Qingfeng couldn't even imagine how far he could ascend.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Gu Qingfeng immediately used three hundred cultivation points to directly advance his Eighteen-Zhang Golden Body to the Perfected stage.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a stream of memories appeared in Gu Qingfeng's mind, and a mighty surge of blood energy erupted, causing his flesh body to emanate golden divine light. Behind him, the illusory figure of a Buddha in the Eighteen-Zhang Golden Body suddenly appeared, and the vast secret chamber seemed to be filled with the chanting of Buddhist sutras.</p><p></p><p>Perfected Eighteen-Zhang Golden Body! Buddha Anomaly!</p><p></p><p>If there were any Buddhists present, they would undoubtedly prostrate themselves in reverence. However, this anomaly was small compared to the anomaly of the ancient immortal body, and it soon dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng opened his eyes, a glint of brilliance flashing in them.</p><p></p><p>"The Eighteen-Zhang Golden Body has reached perfection!" He could clearly feel that with the perfection of the Eighteen-Zhang Golden Body, his flesh body had undergone further transformation.</p><p></p><p>According to the records of the Eighteen-Zhang Golden Body, the perfected Eighteen-Zhang Golden Body could reach the level of being impervious to fire and water. Moreover, the eighth layer of the Eighteen-Zhang Golden Body was equivalent to the peak of the Great Dao Master realm, and the ninth layer had the potential to break through the Great Dao Master bottleneck and ascend to an even higher level.</p><p></p><p>However, this had not been truly achieved yet.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Gu Qingfeng's realm was still at the Perfected Dao Master level, unable to advance further.</p><p></p><p>"The perfected Eighteen-Zhang Golden Body is not enough to break through the limit of the Perfected Dao Master, I must obtain more and stronger martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I must pay a visit to the Divine Martial Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng possessed some Great Dao Master martial arts and could rely on his abundant cultivation points to break through the Perfected Dao Master realm, he suspected that the Martial Patriarch, who seemed to be above the Great Dao Master level, might have left behind martial arts even stronger than the Great Dao Master level.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng suppressed his thoughts and looked at the other rewards this time.</p><p></p><p>The Great Dao Master Promotion Pill, which could instantly achieve the Perfected Great Dao Master realm, was something he did not need to elaborate on.</p><p></p><p>As for the Nine-Level Dao Essence Promotion Pill, it could allow one to enter a state of enlightenment and comprehend the Nine-Level Dao Essence.</p><p></p><p>The Nine-Level Dao Essence was the pinnacle of the Dao Master realm, and to master it was no less difficult than breaking through to the Great Dao Master realm.</p><p></p><p>If a Great Dao Master could also comprehend the Nine-Level Dao Essence, their strength would undergo a qualitative transformation, and they could even be on par with the Nascent Soul realm experts.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the Sword Dao Patriarch had almost reached this level, but it was only after closing himself off for hundreds of years that he was able to barely take the final step and attain the Great Dao Master realm.</p><p></p><p>But even after that breakthrough, the Sword Dao Patriarch had still been stuck at the initial stage of the Great Dao Master realm, unable to advance further.</p><p></p><p>This showed how difficult it was to break through the Great Dao Master realm.</p><p></p><p>But now, Gu Qingfeng had ten Great Dao Master Promotion Pills and ten Nine-Level Dao Essence Promotion Pills, which could instantly create ten Perfected Great Dao Masters and allow them to comprehend the Nine-Level Dao Essence.</p><p></p><p>With such power, any force that possessed it would be able to sweep across the world, and even many immortal sects and ancient families might not be able to withstand the might of ten Great Dao Masters.</p><p></p><p>After that, there were also the other rewards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng carefully examined them, his mind racing with various thoughts and plans for the future development of the Divine Martial Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Brand New Elixirs.</p><p></p><p>One is the Golden Body Elixir.</p><p>The other is the True Meaning Elixir.</p><p></p><p>The former is for cultivators at the Patriarch realm, which can refine the true body of a Patriarch and strengthen the foundation of the cultivator. It can even be used by cultivators at the Void Realm, who may have the chance to break through to the Qi and Blood Patriarch realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng tried taking a Golden Body Elixir, and found that his physical body seemed to have become a bit stronger, but the change was very minor, almost negligible.</p><p></p><p>"It's effective!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Even if the effect of the Golden Body Elixir was weak, it was still effective. </p><p></p><p>At his current level, every bit of growth was not easy to come by.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, the changes brought by the Golden Body Elixir were not changes in realm, but the process of accumulating one's own foundation.</p><p></p><p>If he took the Golden Body Elixir and allowed his foundation at the Extreme Dao Patriarch realm to become even more solid, then the subsequent breakthroughs would bring even greater transformations.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng took the True Meaning Elixir.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Body Elixir was to enhance the Patriarch's physical body, while the True Meaning Elixir could help the cultivator to comprehend the Dao and then grasp the power of the True Meaning.</p><p></p><p>However, the effect of this True Meaning Elixir was completely different from the Nine-Level True Meaning Elixir.</p><p></p><p>After all, the latter could directly allow one to grasp the Nine-Level True Meaning, while the former, although it could also help one to comprehend the Dao, whether one could truly grasp the True Meaning and break through, still depended on one's own enlightenment and opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, although the True Meaning Elixir was not bad, Gu Qingfeng did not feel any effect after taking it.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng understood the reason immediately.</p><p></p><p>He had already broken through the shackles of the True Meaning and entered the Realm level, so the True Meaning Elixir, no matter how good it was, could no longer affect him.</p><p></p><p>"However, although the True Meaning Elixir is useless to me, it can help others accelerate their comprehension of the True Meaning. For example, the Sword Dao cultivator's True Meaning is already not weak. If he can obtain the True Meaning Elixir, he may even have the chance to advance to the True Meaning Grand Patriarch realm!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, Gu Qingfeng summoned an attendant and asked him to bring two Grand Patriarch Promotion Elixirs and two Nine-Level True Meaning Promotion Elixirs back to the Gu Family Manor, and give them to Xu Yulan and Gu Peng respectively.</p><p></p><p>After all, the two of them were already Patriarch Realm Perfected, but their aptitude was too poor. Without any other opportunities, they might never break through to the Grand Patriarch realm.</p><p></p><p>Now that they had the elixirs, Gu Qingfeng naturally wanted to enhance the strength of the people around him.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng summoned another person.</p><p></p><p>"These are two elixirs. One can let you directly break through to the peak of the Grand Patriarch realm, and the other can let you grasp the Nine-Level True Meaning. Go ahead and take them!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" </p><p></p><p>Red Leaf's cold expression showed a hint of emotion, but quickly returned to normal. Without any hesitation or delay, she directly took the two elixirs.</p><p></p><p>As a death knight, she had absolute loyalty to Gu Qingfeng and would not refuse any of his orders.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Red Leaf take the two elixirs, Gu Qingfeng did not say anything further.</p><p></p><p>The reason he let Red Leaf take the elixirs was because Gu Yideng had already been entrusted to Gu Yang's management, and Red Leaf often followed him. Gu Qingfeng had instructed her to do many things.</p><p></p><p>In this way, with Red Leaf's strength enhanced, it would be much easier for her to handle matters.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the elixirs entered her body, Red Leaf's aura suddenly erupted.</p><p></p><p>In less than a moment, she had directly broken through from the Patriarch Realm Peak to the Grand Patriarch Realm Peak.</p><p></p><p>This breakthrough of a whole realm was completed very quickly, without any abruptness.</p><p></p><p>However, this was not the end.</p><p></p><p>After the realm breakthrough, Red Leaf's eyes were tightly closed, and she entered a state of Dao comprehension. A terrifying sword intent arose from her body, and then strange phenomena appeared, as if a cyan lotus phantom emerged.</p><p></p><p>The Cyan Lotus Sword Sutra! This was the martial art that Red Leaf cultivated.</p><p></p><p>It was an extremely profound Grand Patriarch realm supreme skill. Even with Red Leaf's cultivation realm, it was still very difficult for her to comprehend too much.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the help of the Nine-Level True Meaning Promotion Elixir, Red Leaf's understanding of the Cyan Lotus Sword Sutra had greatly increased, and an extremely powerful Cyan Lotus Sword Intent had condensed within her.</p><p></p><p>This sword intent, although it appeared weak in front of Gu Qingfeng, was already terrifying to others at the Nine-Level True Meaning realm.</p><p></p><p>The moment the sword intent appeared, many powerful experts in the city seemed to have a sense of it, and they all looked towards the direction of the Wang Mansion with uncertain expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful sword intent!"</p><p></p><p>"This sword intent is probably only one step away from the True Meaning of a Grand Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Wang Mansion is hiding other powerful experts?"</p><p></p><p>Many people were shocked.</p><p></p><p>The former imperial capital, now the capital of the Shenwu Dynasty, had gathered many powerful experts from all over. Many old-school Patriarchs were hidden here.</p><p></p><p>These Patriarch experts, many of them had comprehended the True Meaning, and some were even on the verge of stepping into the True Meaning Patriarch realm, or had already become True Meaning Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, they were naturally not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>But in the face of the sword intent emanating from the Wang Mansion now, these old-school experts were all feeling a sense of shock.</p><p></p><p>As fellow True Meaning cultivators, the sword intent from the Wang Mansion was undoubtedly much stronger.</p><p></p><p>However, the one truly stunned was the Sword Dao cultivator who had already entered the Grand Patriarch realm.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards the Wang Mansion with an indescribable shock in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Since when has the Wang Mansion hidden such a high-level Sword Dao expert?"</p><p></p><p>If it was a Dao Intent other than the Sword Dao, the Sword Dao cultivator would not be so shocked, after all, it was well known that the Martial Saint was a Sword Dao Saint, and his comprehension of the Sword Dao True Meaning had reached an unfathomable level.</p><p></p><p>But this True Meaning was precisely the Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>For a person to be able to grasp such powerful Sword Intent, the Sword Dao cultivator absolutely did not believe that it was Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>The more powerful a cultivator was, the more pure they would be.</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Qingfeng had reached such a godly level in the Dao of the Blade, it was impossible for him to also be proficient in the Sword Dao.</p><p></p><p>This was precisely why the Sword Dao cultivator felt so incredulous.</p><p></p><p>After all, since Gu Yang ascended the throne, the people in the Wang Mansion had mostly moved into the Imperial City, and only a few remained in the former Wang Mansion.</p><p></p><p>However, although the Sword Dao cultivator was curious, he suppressed the urge to go to the Wang Mansion.</p><p></p><p>After all, even though there were not many people left in the Wang Mansion, Gu Qingfeng was still there. If he were to rashly go there, it would not be good if he offended the other party.</p><p></p><p>The powerful Sword Intent came and went quickly, and when it dissipated, everything returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>But now, many powerful experts were aware that the Wang Mansion was hiding a formidable Sword Dao expert, making them even more wary of the former Wang Mansion.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the Wang Mansion, Gu Qingfeng looked at the completely changed Red Leaf and nodded slightly: "It seems you have succeeded in your breakthrough, well done!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master, for bestowing this opportunity. Your subordinate will give her life for you without hesitation!" </p><p></p><p>Red Leaf knelt down on one knee, and a rare grateful expression appeared on her usually cold and calm face.</p><p></p><p>The two elixirs not only allowed her to break through to the peak of the Grand Patriarch realm, but also allowed her to grasp the Nine-Level True Meaning. Red Leaf was extremely grateful for this.</p><p></p><p>As a death knight, Red Leaf's memories had been implanted with information, making her believe that she had been following Gu Qingfeng for many years, so she did not know much about his hidden trump cards.</p><p></p><p>"You may leave now."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng waved his hand, and Red Leaf's expression returned to its usual coldness as she turned and left.</p><p></p><p>After Red Leaf left, Gu Qingfeng looked towards the direction of the Imperial City and finally walked out of the Wang Mansion, where he had stayed for a long time.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Imperial City, in the Imperial Garden, the emperor Gu Yang, dressed in imperial robes, respectfully greeted Gu Qingfeng: "Son pays respects to Father!"</p><p></p><p>Since ascending the throne, Gu Yang's aura of an emperor had become even more overwhelming, but in front of Gu Qingfeng, his attitude was as it had always been.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, it was only now that Gu Yang had reached the Patriarch Realm Peak that he truly felt the unfathomable depths of his father's power.</p><p></p><p>With such strength, even Patriarch Realm Perfected experts were like insignificant ants before him.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Yang had cultivated the Longevity Sutra as the foundation, and was different from other Patriarchs in the jianghu. Although he was at the Patriarch Realm Peak, ordinary Grand Patriarchs could be directly suppressed by him.</p><p></p><p>"You have now established the Shenwu Dynasty using the method of Forging the Immortal Courtyard. What kind of techniques do you possess?" Gu Qingfeng asked.</p><p></p><p>He had already witnessed the method of Forging the Immortal Courtyard, and naturally understood that once the dynasty was established and the world's spiritual energy was gathered, various mysterious techniques could be deployed.</p><p></p><p>But as for the specific techniques, Gu Qingfeng had not delved deeply into cultivating this secret method, so he did not have much understanding of it.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang said, "As the ruler of the Shenwu Dynasty, as long as it is within the dynasty's borders, I can manipulate the national aura to suppress powerful enemies."</p><p></p><p>"If it's just using the national aura to suppress a certain area, even Transcendent Realm cultivators would find it difficult to stir up any waves."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, within the realm of the dynasty, if there are any natural disasters, I can use the national aura to suppress the disasters, change the celestial phenomena, and allow the common people to live in peace without being troubled by calamities!"</p><p></p><p>"However, such techniques will consume the national aura. If used too frequently, the national aura will be depleted. Once the national aura is exhausted, natural disasters and human disasters will arise one after another, and at that time, the Shenwu Dynasty will not be far from disintegration!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's words made Gu Qingfeng nod slightly.</p><p></p><p>Although the consequences seemed severe, the mysteries of the national aura were indeed profound.</p><p></p><p>If the Great Xuan Dynasty had had such a method back then, would those unruly major sects and families have dared to rebel? As long as they did not submit, they would all be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>This power that could suppress Transcendent Realm experts was something that other forces could not contend with.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore," Gu Yang continued, "as the ruler of the dynasty, I can receive the blessing of the national aura, and my cultivation progress will be much faster than before. Even the various officials and bureaucrats of the dynasty, as long as they hold official positions, can receive the corresponding national aura blessing and obtain certain benefits!"</p><p></p><p>While Gu Qingfeng was pondering, Gu Yang had already continued speaking.</p><p></p><p>By establishing the Shenwu Dynasty and relying on the surging national aura, Gu Yang had directly stepped into the Patriarch Realm Peak.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, in the past few days of cultivation, Gu Yang not only stabilized his Patriarch Realm Peak cultivation, but also vaguely seemed to have the intention to advance further.</p><p></p><p>Even Gu Yang's talent in the past was not bad, but he had not reached this level.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that under the blessing of the national aura, his cultivation talent had grown to an astonishing degree.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the past, the current Gu Yang had completely surpassed several realms.

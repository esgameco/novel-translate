        <h1>Chapter 219</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Inheritance of the Sage!</p><p></p><p>From the information in the jade slip, Gu Qingfeng finally understood the origins of the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>The other party was named Murong Xiu, a true disciple of a force called the Divine Yang Sacred Land.</p><p></p><p>As for the Divine Yang Sacred Land, it originated from the Primal Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Primal Chaos Realm, is in fact the Nine Prefectures beneath our feet.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, a corner of the Primal Chaos Realm is the Nine Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Qingfeng had previously guessed, there is an even more vast world beyond the Nine Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Prefectures and other places are collectively known as the Primal Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Yang Sacred Land is a major force in the Primal Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Gu Qingfeng also understood the realms beyond the Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>Divine Transformation! Dao Palace! Sage!</p><p></p><p>These are the three realms above the Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Transformation Realm is divided into nine layers. Upon entering this realm, one's blood can undergo another transformation, possessing all kinds of divine abilities, such as the regeneration of severed limbs.</p><p></p><p>In his peak period, Murong Xiu was a powerful expert at the pinnacle of the ninth layer of the Divine Transformation Realm, just one step away from the rumored Dao Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Murong Xiu accidentally obtained the inheritance of a Sage in an ancient secret realm, and this news later leaked out, causing the entire Divine Yang Sacred Land to be affected.</p><p></p><p>Although the Divine Yang Sacred Land was not weak, it had an expert at the Dao Palace Realm at its peak. </p><p></p><p>However, the Divine Yang Sacred Land had long since declined. The strongest expert in the vast Sacred Land was only at the half-step Dao Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the Divine Yang Sacred Land was destroyed. Murong Xiu himself was also severely injured.</p><p></p><p>However, he managed to break out of the battle using his trump cards, and finally crossed the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, entering the Nine Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the Nine Prefectures, Murong Xiu discovered that the martial dao here was backward, so he temporarily settled down, hoping to recover from his injuries, comprehend the Sage's inheritance, and then return to take revenge for the Divine Yang Sacred Land.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Murong Xiu underestimated the severity of his injuries. This injury not only made it difficult for him to heal, but also greatly reduced his lifespan.</p><p></p><p>For this reason, Murong Xiu established the Divine Martial Sect, and then, seeing that the martial dao in this world was weak, he casually passed down some cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>However, these cultivation methods were only some ordinary techniques that Murong Xiu had obtained in the past, and were not the true inheritance of the Divine Yang Sacred Land.</p><p></p><p>The inheritance left in this jade slip was the true inheritance of the Divine Yang Sacred Land.</p><p></p><p>The reason he did this was because Murong Xiu had his own considerations. After all, the Divine Yang Sacred Land was destroyed, and he was also being hunted down. If he rashly passed down the inheritance of the Divine Yang Sacred Land, it might also expose his whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Murong Xiu placed the inheritance of the Divine Yang Sacred Land and his own obtained Sage's inheritance in the jade slip, waiting for the day when the Divine Martial Sect would produce a true powerful expert, who could then break the restrictions of the jade slip and inherit his will.</p><p></p><p>The reason he set the restrictions at the level of the True Meaning Grand Master was because the spiritual energy in the Nine Prefectures was relatively weak, and it was already difficult for ordinary cultivators to reach the Grand Master realm.</p><p></p><p>If they could break through to the True Meaning Grand Master in this place, then it would be a sure thing for them to enter the Divine Transformation Realm when they left the Nine Prefectures, and it would not be impossible for them to even attain the Dao Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, if the inheritance fell into the hands of ordinary cultivators, it would truly be a waste.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, cultivators!</p><p></p><p>In the Primal Chaos Realm, warriors have a unified title, and that is "cultivators".</p><p></p><p>Now, in Gu Qingfeng's mind, there are two inheritances.</p><p></p><p>One is called the Divine Yang Sutra, and the other is called the Primal Chaos Heaven Sword.</p><p></p><p>The former is the inheritance of the Divine Yang Sacred Land, while the latter is the Sage's inheritance obtained by Murong Xiu.</p><p></p><p>As the inheritance of the Divine Yang Sacred Land, the Divine Yang Sutra is a supreme technique that directly points to the nine layers of the Dao Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the Primal Chaos Heaven Sword, it is a supreme technique involving the six layers of the Sage Realm.</p><p></p><p>Divine Transformation Realm, Dao Palace Realm, Sage Realm - each of these three realms is divided into nine layers.</p><p></p><p>Although the Divine Yang Sutra is not as powerful as the Primal Chaos Heaven Sword, as a supreme technique that directly points to the nine layers of the Dao Palace Realm, it is naturally extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"The nine layers of the Divine Transformation Realm, I wonder which layer my current true strength belongs to?"</p><p></p><p>"The world is indeed vast, not just the simple Nine Prefectures!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng truly felt the vastness of the world, far beyond just the Nine Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, from the Divine Yang Sutra and the information left by Murong Xiu, Gu Qingfeng also indirectly understood one thing.</p><p></p><p>That is, the martial dao in the Nine Prefectures is not actually a deficient martial dao.</p><p></p><p>It is because the level of this martial dao is not high.</p><p></p><p>In the Primal Chaos Realm, there are ordinary inheritances, just like the current inheritances in the Nine Prefectures, and there are also powerful inheritances that can establish a perfect foundation.</p><p></p><p>The perfection of the foundation affects not only the depth of one's strength, but also one's lifespan.</p><p></p><p>As for the former, we won't discuss it for now.</p><p></p><p>In terms of lifespan, as long as one can enter the Divine Transformation Realm, the gap can be made up.</p><p></p><p>No matter what kind of foundation a cultivator has, as long as they can break through the Divine Transformation Realm, they can obtain five thousand years of lifespan.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, even if one cultivates an ordinary inheritance and can only live for eight hundred years at the Grand Master realm, as long as they can break through the Divine Transformation Realm, they can immediately enjoy five thousand years of lifespan.</p><p></p><p>It's just that - in the current Nine Prefectures, it is already extremely difficult to break through to the Grand Master realm, let alone break through to the Divine Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>So over the millennia, there has not been a single cultivator in the Nine Prefectures who has broken through the Divine Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>This is not only due to the lack of inheritance, but also the difficulty in breaking through the Divine Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if the Nine Prefectures truly had the cultivation methods of the Divine Transformation Realm passed down, perhaps there would be some powerful experts who could enter this realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, over the years, the Nine Prefectures have also produced some extraordinary talents who have reached the peak of the Grand Master realm.</p><p></p><p>But without guidance, they were unable to truly break through.</p><p></p><p>Those who can rely on their own strength to open up a new path are ultimately very few.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng turned his attention back to the Divine Yang Sutra in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Yang Sutra is divided into five chapters:</p><p>Refining the Body, Sect Master, Grand Master, Divine Transformation, and Dao Palace. Each chapter corresponds to a realm.</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Qingfeng had previously thought, the five stages from refining the skin to refining the organs can be considered a single realm, collectively referred to as the Refining the Body Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Yang Sutra, it is indeed like this.</p><p></p><p>The Refining the Body chapter is divided into five layers, corresponding to five realms.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master and Grand Master chapters are divided into four layers, corresponding to four realms.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the Divine Transformation and Dao Palace chapters are divided into nine layers, directly pointing to the nine layers of the Divine Transformation Realm and the Dao Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>It is worth mentioning that the Refining the Body chapter of the Divine Yang Sutra involves the perfection of body refinement, discussing the profound levels, completely not inferior to the Longevity Sutra that Gu Qingfeng had previously created.</p><p></p><p>"If I had obtained the Divine Yang Sutra earlier, I would not have wasted so much time creating the Longevity Sutra!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He had spent a lot of effort creating the Longevity Sutra.</p><p></p><p>But now, he found that the Divine Yang Sutra had methods for perfecting body refinement.</p><p></p><p>This also indirectly shows the power of the Divine Yang Sutra.</p><p></p><p>Among cultivators at the same Refining the Body Realm, those who cultivate the supreme techniques of the Divine Yang Sutra will naturally be much stronger than those who cultivate ordinary techniques.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, even in the Sect Master and Grand Master chapters, the cultivation methods recorded in the Divine Yang Sutra are far superior to the sect master and grand master supreme skills currently circulating in the Nine Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>Then there is the Primal Chaos Heaven Sword.</p><p></p><p>This inheritance involving the Sage Realm is difficult for Gu Qingfeng to comprehend much of, even with his current realm.</p><p></p><p>It can be seen that the inheritance of the Sage Realm is truly profound and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Desolation Fist Classic and the Divine Yang Sutra are both inheritances of the Divine Yang Sacred Land, while the Primal Chaos Heaven Sword is the inheritance of the Sage. Although the latter is not a cultivation technique, if I can cultivate this supreme skill successfully, my strength can be terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>"From the information left by Murong Xiu, it can be seen that Sages are rare in the Primal Chaos Realm. Those who can enter the Divine Transformation Realm are already qualified to dominate a region, and those who can enter the Dao Palace Realm already have the qualifications to establish a major sect.</p><p></p><p>If one can reach the pinnacle of the nine layers of the Dao Palace Realm and step into the so-called half-Sage realm, they may even be able to establish a Sacred Land."</p><p></p><p>"Normally, only Sages can establish Sacred Lands, but with the scarcity of Sages, those who are half-Sages can also be considered qualified to establish a Sacred Land, albeit with difficulty."</p><p></p><p>Many pieces of information left by Murong Xiu flashed through Gu Qingfeng's mind, involving many things about the Primal Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, Murong Xiu was well aware that the cultivators in the Nine Prefectures would not have much understanding of the Primal Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>If he were to leave the Nine Prefectures while possessing the inheritance of the Divine Yang Sacred Land, and his identity was exposed, he might be killed on the spot.</p><p></p><p>By leaving behind the inheritance, Murong Xiu naturally hoped that someone would be able to revive the Divine Yang Sacred Land.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he left behind all the information he was clear about in the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>It's just that, Murong Xiu himself probably didn't expect that the Divine Martial Sect he established would be so disappointing.</p><p></p><p>Over the millennia, not a single True Meaning Grand Master had appeared.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Gu Qingfeng's appearance, the Divine Martial Sect would probably have been destroyed by other forces after another thousand years of transmission.</p><p></p><p>In that case, the inheritance left behind by Murong Xiu might have fallen into the hands of who knows who.</p><p></p><p>"I cannot revive the Divine Yang Sacred Land, but I will not let its inheritance be extinguished. If the Divine Martial Sect can produce someone who can cultivate it successfully in the future, perhaps they can fulfill your wish!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, he had obtained Murong Xiu's inheritance, and he owed the other party a favor.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng possessed the Divine Yang Sutra, and he had no intention of hoarding this technique. In the vast Divine Martial Sect, the only one qualified to cultivate the Divine Yang Sutra is the Elder Gu at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Elder Gu has already broken through to the Grand Master realm. Passing the Divine Yang Sutra to him, perhaps he might have the possibility of reviving the Divine Yang Sacred Land in the future.</p><p></p><p>Even if the probability is small, it still exists.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng's gaze fell on the Divine Yang Sutra, and with a thought, he began to cultivate this supreme technique.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Consumed one point of Advancement.</p><p>The Divine Yang Sutra broke through the first layer of the Refining the Body chapter.</p><p>Consumed two points of Advancement.</p><p>The Divine Yang Sutra broke through...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Refining the Body, Second Layer.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Consumed 20 Upgrade Points.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Yang Sutra broke through to the Fifth Layer of the Refining the Body chapter.</p><p></p><p>Consumed 50 Upgrade Points. </p><p></p><p>The Divine Yang Sutra broke through to the First Layer of the Grandmaster chapter.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng consumed a large number of Upgrade Points, and the Divine Yang Sutra, which had not yet been mastered, was rapidly improving at a visible speed.</p><p></p><p>As the Divine Yang Sutra improved,</p><p></p><p>a large amount of information also surged in Gu Qingfeng's mind.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>the aura around him became increasingly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The Grandmaster chapter! The Great Grandmaster chapter!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In less than a moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had cultivated the Great Grandmaster chapter of the Divine Yang Sutra to perfection.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p></p><p>he did not hesitate at all, and directly continued to upgrade.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>When the Divine Yang Sutra stepped into the Divine Transformation chapter, a terrifying aura suddenly erupted from Gu Qingfeng's body, as if suppressing the ancient void, causing the entire courtyard to be covered by this terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>The jujube tree next to him trembled slightly, as if cheering joyfully, or as if fearing something.</p><p></p><p>The waiting Ancient Cloud outside the courtyard, upon sensing this terrifying aura, was greatly alarmed on his face, and his own Great Grandmaster cultivation realm now seemed as insignificant as an ant.</p><p></p><p>His blood and qi trembled.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Cloud's expression was shocked, and he had an indescribable trepidation in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Has Master Gu broken through again?"</p><p></p><p>"Such a terrifying aura, I wonder what realm Master Gu has reached!"</p><p></p><p>Ancient Cloud was shocked.</p><p></p><p>But he did not dare to intrude.</p><p></p><p>Not only because the courtyard was now covered by this terrifying power, and anyone who dared to enter would be instantly killed.</p><p></p><p>But also because Ancient Cloud was afraid of disturbing the other's breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Divine Transformation First Layer! Divine Transformation Second Layer!</p><p></p><p>Divine Transformation Third Layer!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's aura kept rising, and his advancement was almost unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>In an instant,</p><p></p><p>the Divine Transformation chapter of the Divine Yang Sutra had been completely cultivated.</p><p></p><p>Immediately,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng upgraded again.</p><p></p><p>In a flash,</p><p></p><p>he only felt a terrifying blood and qi power converging in his dantian, as if something was gestating there, and at the same time, a mysterious power emanated from Gu Qingfeng's body, quickly bursting out of the courtyard and covering the entire Divine Martial Sect.</p><p></p><p>After a long time,</p><p></p><p>these changes dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng opened his eyes, exhaled a turbid breath, and then looked at his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng  Age: 51/6000  Realm: Dao Palace Realm First Layer</p><p></p><p>Martial Arts: Heaven Vein True Sutra (Second Layer), Heaven Blade (Perfected), Great Desolation Fist Sutra (Perfected), Divine Yang Sutra (Dao Palace Realm First Layer), Desolate Ancient Heaven Blade (Not Mastered)</p><p></p><p>Upgrade Points: 1294...</p><p></p><p>The attribute panel had changed greatly, and many of the previous martial arts and techniques had disappeared, only a few being retained.</p><p></p><p>Then,</p><p></p><p>the subsequent traits also disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The vast panel</p><p></p><p>had become much neater.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Qingfeng understood.</p><p></p><p>The disappearance of the traits was only a literal disappearance, and his strength had not diminished at all.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that now when I cultivate lower-level martial arts, they will no longer be displayed on the attribute panel, and only martial arts that have at least reached the Divine Transformation realm can be displayed on the panel."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng mused.</p><p></p><p>This actually doesn't affect him much.</p><p></p><p>Whether the attribute panel displays it or not, it doesn't affect the fact that he has already mastered these supreme techniques.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng began to observe the changes in himself.</p><p></p><p>After the continuous upgrades, his cultivation had completely broken through the original limits, even surpassing the limits of the previous Martial Ancestor, and stepped into the rumored Dao Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing the metamorphosis of the nine layers of Divine Transformation, and then the breakthrough to the Dao Palace Realm, Gu Qingfeng's blood and qi power had reached an unimaginable level.</p><p></p><p>If he were to face his former self,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng felt that he could easily kill his previous self with just a finger.</p><p></p><p>This is</p><p></p><p>the power of the Dao Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>after breaking through to the Dao Palace Realm,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also opened the Dao Palace in his dantian and cultivated his Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>The previous existence</p><p></p><p>involved power on the spiritual level.</p><p></p><p>Before breaking through to the Dao Palace Realm, cultivators could not truly master the power of the Primordial Spirit, and could only rely on the comprehension of the Profound Truths to enhance their spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>If one's spiritual power was not strong enough, one would not be able to match a Dao Palace Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Normally,</p><p></p><p>for a Dao Palace Realm cultivator to suppress a Divine Transformation Realm cultivator would be an easy task.</p><p></p><p>The difference at this level</p><p></p><p>is much greater than the difference between so-called Grandmaster and Great Grandmaster, or even from Great Grandmaster to Divine Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>"According to the records of the Divine Yang Sutra, the Primordial Spirit formed by a newly promoted Dao Palace Realm First Layer cultivator should only be one inch in size, but my Primordial Spirit is a full five inches, making it several times stronger than a typical newly promoted Dao Palace Realm First Layer cultivator."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked inward, and saw that in his dantian, a Dao Palace had been opened, and within the Dao Palace, a five-inch Primordial Spirit was sitting in a cross-legged position.</p><p></p><p>If one looked closely, one would find that this five-inch Primordial Spirit was identical in appearance to Gu Qingfeng himself.</p><p></p><p>This five-inch Primordial Spirit,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng suspected that the reason he was able to condense such a Primordial Spirit was largely due to his comprehension of many Profound Truths.</p><p></p><p>After all, the comprehension of Profound Truths is essentially a way to enhance one's spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>The condensation of the Primordial Spirit</p><p></p><p>is also a manifestation of spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng, upon breaking through to the Dao Palace Realm, was able to condense a five-inch Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Next,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng broke off his right little finger, and saw fresh blood spill out, but in less than a few breaths, the wound stopped bleeding, and flesh began to grow back, and in just a moment, a brand new finger appeared.</p><p></p><p>During the regeneration of the finger, Gu Qingfeng also felt a slight sense of weakness.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng did not pay much attention to this weakness, and there was an undisguised smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Limb regeneration!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems the rumors are not false--"</p><p></p><p>Cultivators at the Divine Transformation Realm can indeed regenerate their limbs, but for ordinary Divine Transformation Realm cultivators, being able to casually regenerate a finger is not something they can do.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Qingfeng had already broken through the barriers of the Divine Transformation Realm and reached the Dao Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>although limb regeneration has its benefits, the consumption is also not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Just breaking off a finger is already like this, if it was an entire arm, or even more serious injuries, then even if he wanted to regenerate the limb, it might not be that simple.</p><p></p><p>These things,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not try to further test.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that he could regenerate limbs was enough, there was no need to continue verifying it.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the severed finger in front of him, which still had a surging life force and was filled with a powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>This severed finger alone would be enough to suppress ordinary Divine Transformation Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>This also indirectly shows the power of Dao Palace Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>A severed finger</p><p></p><p>can suppress Divine Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>This made Gu Qingfeng think of the severed finger he had obtained from the evil spirit of the Blood Mountain Mansion.</p><p></p><p>But even with Gu Qingfeng's current perspective, that severed finger was still unfathomable, and although this severed finger of his also had formidable power,</p><p></p><p>if there was no secret technique to preserve its characteristics, the power within the finger would eventually be exhausted over time.</p><p></p><p>Immediately,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took out a jade bottle and placed the severed finger inside, wondering if it could be of some use in the future.</p><p></p><p>Then,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the jujube tree beside him.</p><p></p><p>These past few days, he had cultivated under the jujube tree, and in one breath broke through the nine layers of Divine Transformation and entered the Dao Palace Realm, which had also caused the tree to be infused with more mysterious aura.</p><p></p><p>And with the addition of the slight blood from Gu Qingfeng's wound just now, which was silently absorbed by the jujube tree, the spirituality of the tree had greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>In this way,</p><p></p><p>the jujube tree will probably nurture spiritual wisdom in not too long a time.</p><p></p><p>"This has allowed you to find a bit of opportunity, but it's fine, I obtained the Great Desolation Fist Sutra from you, and now you have also gained some opportunity from me, so the karmic relationship is settled!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled calmly, and at his words, the branches and leaves of the jujube tree swayed, as if expressing gratitude, or as if telling him something.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not pay much attention, and redirected his focus back to his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining,</p><p></p><p>he had over 1,200 Upgrade Points left.</p><p></p><p>Each advancement in the Dao Palace Realm requires 500 Upgrade Points.</p><p></p><p>If he were to use all of them to upgrade the Divine Yang Sutra, he could break through to the Dao Palace Realm Third Layer.</p><p></p><p>But--</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the Desolate Ancient Heaven Blade.</p><p></p><p>This Saint-Emperor inheritance is also what he desires in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"According to the records of the Divine Yang Sutra, the Dao Palace Realm also emphasizes the cultivation of a solid foundation, and the strength of the Primordial Spirit is related to whether one can eventually break through to the Saint-Emperor Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Only by refining the Primordial Spirit to the limit can I then proceed to upgrade my cultivation realm."</p><p></p><p>"Now that my Primordial Spirit is five inches, much stronger than other Dao Palace Realm First Layer cultivators, but it has not yet reached the true limit."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I don't need to hurry to break through to the Dao Palace Realm Second Layer, I'll first refine my Primordial Spirit to the limit of my current realm, and then break through later!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had a plan in mind.</p><p></p><p>The simplest way to refine the Primordial Spirit is to comprehend powerful Profound Truths.</p><p></p><p>Like the supreme techniques of the Saint-Emperor Realm, once mastered, the Profound Truths contained within would definitely be extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>It's just that when Gu Qingfeng's thoughts fell on the Desolate Ancient Heaven Blade, he shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Two thousand Upgrade Points!"</p><p></p><p>"To upgrade the Desolate Ancient Heaven Blade, I can only wait until later!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was clear about the power of Saint-Emperor Realm inheritances, and he expected that upgrading such martial arts would require a high number of Upgrade Points.</p><p></p><p>But to just enter it requires two thousand Upgrade Points, which made Gu Qingfeng hesitant.</p><p></p><p>Right now he only had less than 1,300 Upgrade Points, and to upgrade the Desolate Ancient Heaven Blade, he still needed to accumulate more.</p><p></p><p>Even so,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was already extremely satisfied with this trip to the Divine Martial Sect.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation had broken through, directly shattering several major realm barriers and stepping into a realm higher than the Martial Ancestor, his strength greatly increased, and his lifespan had even broken through six thousand years.</p><p></p><p>If he had not come to the Divine Martial Sect, even if Gu Qingfeng had thousands of Upgrade Points, he would not have been able to maximize the benefits of those Upgrade Points.</p><p></p><p>Immediately,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's spiritual sense moved, and the power that had covered the courtyard also suddenly dissipated without a trace.

        <h1>Chapter 72</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Exorcism Bureau.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin returned.</p><p></p><p>Lu Wenxuan asked, "How did it go?"</p><p></p><p>"He didn't agree."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin shook his head slightly, and a cold glint immediately flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"However, the rumors in the jianghu are not true, this person is not at the Xisui realm, but has already stepped into the realm of a minor sect master of the Lianzang (Refining Impurity) cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"So I didn't attack him. A minor sect master of the Lianzang realm, and moreover a pure martial artist, perhaps he can be used as a nail to be inserted into the Taishan Dao."</p><p></p><p>"The various sects and aristocratic families will not tolerate the Gu Family Manor dominating the Taishan Dao, but if the lord of the Gu Family Manor is a minor sect master, then it's a different story.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful expert, even those at the Yuling (Commanding Spirits) realm may not necessarily be his match. Looking at the entire Guangyang Prefecture, how many Yuling realm cultivators can there be!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin ended with a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>Lu Wenxuan's eyes narrowed slightly: "A minor sect master of the Lianzang realm!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that either.</p><p></p><p>In a small place like Baishi Dao, there could actually emerge a minor sect master of the Lianzang realm.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention Baishi Dao. Even in the flourishing martial arts of the Taishan Dao, with the numerous sects and forces in the jianghu, they have not seen the emergence of such a powerful expert at the minor sect master level.</p><p></p><p>Yet, a small place like Baishi Dao has actually produced a minor sect master, which is truly unexpected.</p><p></p><p>Among the seventy-two paths of the Guangyang Prefecture, the strength of the Taishan Dao can be ranked among the top ten.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the Taishan Dao was under the control of the Qingyang Sect, but now that the Qingyang Sect has been destroyed, the Taishan Dao has nominally fallen into the hands of the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>In this case, the various sects in the jianghu will certainly not turn a blind eye.</p><p></p><p>Just as Jiang Qin said, the people of the Guangyang Prefecture have all underestimated that person.</p><p></p><p>If he was only at the Xisui realm, it would have been fine, but a person who has already stepped into the Lianzang realm and can be called a minor sect master, the matter is not that simple.</p><p></p><p>"You did the right thing."</p><p></p><p>"A minor sect master is already not weak, at least in the Guangyang Prefecture, he can be considered one of the top experts."</p><p></p><p>"Since it is so, let them fight among themselves. We, the Exorcism Bureau, will sit firmly on the Diaoyu Terrace and have no need to intervene. The most urgent task at hand is to find the whereabouts of that evil spirit."</p><p></p><p>"As long as we can subdue that evil spirit, all other problems will not be problems."</p><p></p><p>Lu Wenxuan waved his hand, also agreeing with Jiang Qin's words, temporarily leaving the affairs in the jianghu unattended.</p><p></p><p>When two tigers fight, one is bound to be injured.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of who wins or loses, for the Exorcism Bureau, there is only benefit and no harm.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>A few days after Jiang Qin's departure, another guest arrived.</p><p></p><p>"I am Zhuo Feng, greetings to the lord of the Gu Family Manor!"</p><p></p><p>In the main hall of the Gu Family Manor, a young man in white robes floated out, with a faint smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's calm gaze fell on Zhuo Feng, and information about the Zhuo family instantly appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The Zhuo family! </p><p></p><p>A thousand-year-old aristocratic family in the Guangyang Prefecture. In terms of heritage, it is much stronger than the Qingyang Sect.</p><p></p><p>Although Zhuo Feng appears young, and his aura is hidden, with Gu Qingfeng's current eyesight, he can clearly feel the ageless, solemn aura and the faint evil essence emanating from the other party.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator! </p><p></p><p>This is a cultivator no weaker than the old patriarch of the Qingyang Sect. In an instant, Gu Qingfeng put all his thoughts in order and then said calmly, "May I ask what position you hold in the Zhuo family?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid the lord of the Gu Family Manor will find it amusing, but I am currently an elder of the Zhuo family."</p><p></p><p>"So you are Elder Zhuo!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded his head, then directly asked the question.</p><p></p><p>"The Gu Family Manor has no connection with the Zhuo Family, so I wonder what brings Elder Zhuo here today?"</p><p></p><p>Regarding Gu Qingfeng's directness, Zhuo Feng also remained calm, with a faint smile on his face throughout.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that the Lord of the Gu Manor has destroyed the Qingyang Sect, and his reputation has spread throughout the entire Guangyang Prefecture. I, Zhuo, have long admired him, and now that I've finally met him, I find the rumors to be true."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Zhuo Feng then changed the topic, his expression becoming more serious.</p><p></p><p>"I've come here for two reasons - one is to congratulate the Lord of the Gu Manor on his fame in the jianghu, and the other is to ask the Lord of the Gu Manor about his views on the current state of the Taishan Dao."</p><p></p><p>"I'm not very clear on Elder Zhuo's meaning," Gu Qingfeng said calmly as he picked up his teacup and narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhuo Feng spoke frankly, "Since that's the case, then I won't beat around the bush. I've come to ask the Lord of the Gu Manor if he has any intentions of taking control of the Taishan Dao."</p><p></p><p>"What if I do, and what if I don't?" Gu Qingfeng responded.</p><p></p><p>"If the Lord of the Gu Manor truly has the intention of taking control of the Taishan Dao, the Zhuo Family will certainly offer our blessings. However, the Taishan Dao is treacherous, and the forces eyeing it are numerous. Although the Lord of the Gu Manor has the ability to control the Taishan Dao, there is one problem - the Lord of the Gu Manor is a martial artist, not a practitioner of the occult arts!"</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Feng looked at Gu Qingfeng's expression as he said this, and seeing that the other party remained calm, he continued.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that the people from the Zhenxie司 have recently visited the Gu Family Manor, so I believe the Lord of the Gu Manor understands the difference between martial artists and practitioners of the occult arts.</p><p></p><p>My Zhuo Family is also a martial arts family, and we have no contempt for martial artists."</p><p></p><p>"However, the current situation in the world is such that practitioners of the occult arts are revered, while martial artists are somewhat inferior. The Taishan Dao is different from the Baishi Dao; among the seventy-two sects in the Guangyang Prefecture, the former ranks among the top ten."</p><p></p><p>"If the Lord of the Gu Manor wishes to take control of the Taishan Dao and replace the position of the former Qingyang Sect, he must be prepared to deal with the various sects and families. Unlike the Qingyang Sect, which was only a few hundred years old, the long-standing sects and families in the Guangyang Prefecture have much deeper roots, some even dating back a thousand years."</p><p></p><p>"These sects and families not only have one Yuling Boundary expert guarding them, but the Lord of the Gu Manor's strength may not necessarily be enough to prevail against these thousand-year-old sects and families."</p><p></p><p>As Zhuo Feng laid out the pros and cons, Gu Qingfeng's expression remained unchanged. Some of these words had already been said by Jiang Qin, so the other party was merely repeating them.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, as soon as Zhuo Feng finished speaking, Gu Qingfeng spoke directly.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to say so many platitudes. The Zhuo Family is also a thousand-year-old family, so I'm sure you have your own ideas about the Taishan Dao."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, Elder Zhuo's visit here today is not just to say a few words, is it? What is your true purpose? You might as well lay it out directly."</p><p></p><p>At these words, Zhuo Feng's expression faltered momentarily, but he soon smiled again.</p><p></p><p>"You're right, my Zhuo Family does have ambitions regarding the Taishan Dao, after all, it is one of the top ten sects in the Guangyang Prefecture, containing resources of extraordinary value."</p><p></p><p>"As for the purpose of my visit, it is to gauge the Lord of the Gu Manor's views on the Taishan Dao."</p><p></p><p>"If the Lord of the Gu Manor has no intention of vying for control of the Taishan Dao, then my Zhuo Family will dispatch our experts to enter the Taishan Dao and strive for its mastery."</p><p></p><p>"However, since the Qingyang Sect was ultimately destroyed by the Lord of the Gu Manor, my Zhuo Family is also willing to offer some compensation."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

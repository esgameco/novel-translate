        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A month ago, </p><p></p><p>People in Linxian County had been dying in various tragic and mysterious ways.</p><p></p><p>However, since Linxian County is a county-level city, not too big or too small, and Gu Qingfeng had always been confined to the martial arts school, with little knowledge of the outside world, he had not heard about it.</p><p></p><p>In the following days,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng delved deeper into the situation in Linxian County.</p><p></p><p>He discovered that the frequency of deaths in Linxian County was increasing, becoming more and more concentrated.</p><p></p><p>In the beginning, there was only one household dying every three to five days, but now it was almost one household per day, and sometimes even two or three households per day.</p><p></p><p>As the number of deaths increased, the rumors of unclean forces appearing in Linxian County also became more and more rampant. Many civilians were in a state of panic, and some even had the idea of moving out of Linxian County.</p><p></p><p>Because of this,</p><p></p><p>The government issued an announcement, stating that a murderer had been roaming Linxian County, committing these murder cases, but the authorities had already grasped the perpetrator's whereabouts and would soon apprehend him, reassuring all the civilians.</p><p></p><p>With this news,</p><p></p><p>The unrest among the civilians was suppressed to the minimum.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>When this news reached Gu Qingfeng's ears, it made him furrow his brows.</p><p></p><p>"A fugitive murderer... I'm afraid it's not that simple."</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>These were just Gu Qingfeng's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>As for the specifics, he had not yet figured them out.</p><p></p><p>Back in the courtyard,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng saw Gu Yang practicing the Collapse Mountain Fist. He frowned slightly, "Aren't you supposed to go to the private school today?"</p><p></p><p>"The teacher said the county has been unstable lately, so he has given us a few days off, and will notify us when the classes resume."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly, glanced at his attribute panel, and his worries suddenly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Why bother thinking so much?</p><p></p><p>Whether it's something sinister or a fugitive murderer, as long as his own strength is strong enough, all problems will not be problems.</p><p></p><p>The priority now is to quickly improve his strength, and for that, he needs Gu Yang to break through first.</p><p></p><p>If his son breaks through,</p><p></p><p>Then he, as the father, can break through as well.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng quietly took out a Blood Qi Pill and handed it to Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>"This is a Blood Qi Pill, specifically to assist your cultivation of the Collapse Mountain Fist. Since the private school is not in session, you can stay at home and cultivate diligently. Take one pill per day, but be careful not to take too many.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it could damage your meridians, or even lead to death!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng spoke the last part with great seriousness.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Qi Pill is not something that can kill people, but taking too much is not a good thing, so he intentionally exaggerated the consequences to prevent this child from taking his words lightly.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough,</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing that taking too much could lead to death, Gu Yang's face turned pale, and he hurriedly said, "Father, don't worry, I won't take too many."</p><p></p><p>"Good, that's best!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng then pointed out a few details regarding Gu Yang's cultivation of the Collapse Mountain Fist, and then went to the other side to cultivate the Iron Body Technique.</p><p></p><p>Since he obtained the Iron Body Technique a month ago,</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because he had already broken through the Refine Skin realm, Gu Qingfeng's speed in cultivating the Iron Body Technique was much faster than when he cultivated the Collapse Mountain Fist.</p><p></p><p>He only took a month to successfully enter the initial stage of the Iron Body Technique.</p><p></p><p>As the Iron Body Technique reached the initial stage, Gu Qingfeng could feel his skin becoming even more resilient, although the changes were...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's not particularly obvious, but it's a real and tangible increase in strength.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>On the attribute panel, the realm hasn't changed much.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng doesn't mind either.</p><p></p><p>The attribute panel not changing doesn't mean he hasn't become stronger.</p><p></p><p>In the current environment, he must strive to improve his own strength as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passes.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, another three months have gone by.</p><p></p><p>During these three months, Linxian County has become much more peaceful, and there are no more unexpected deaths of civilians, as if everything has returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng no longer pays much attention to these matters.</p><p></p><p>With the Qi Blood Elixir used up, he used his own savings to purchase some tempering body washes and pills from the Golden Bull Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>These things.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng mostly gave to Gu Yang to cultivate, and only used a small portion himself.</p><p></p><p>But even so.</p><p></p><p>In three months.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has successfully cultivated the Iron Body Technique to the minor success stage.</p><p></p><p>The minor success of the Iron Body Technique.</p><p></p><p>Makes Gu Qingfeng feel that his body has become noticeably different.</p><p></p><p>He brought a weapon and slashed at his own arm, but the sharp weapon couldn't even leave a white mark on his skin.</p><p></p><p>Then he clenched his hand tightly, and the tempered weapon became a pile of scrap iron.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>When he previously perfected the Skin Refining, although he could achieve a certain degree of invulnerability to blades and swords, he could never reach this level.</p><p></p><p>It's clear.</p><p></p><p>This is the wonder brought about by the breakthrough of the Iron Body Technique.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>The information panel, which had been silent for a long time, was refreshed with a new message.</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has broken through to the middle stage of Skin Refining!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 2 Upgrade Points!"</p><p>"Reward: 30 Qi Blood Elixirs!"</p><p>"Reward: 10 Blood Refining Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>This reward does not include any martial arts, but there are two upgrade points, as well as a brand new type of elixir.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Refining Elixir! When Gu Qingfeng's thoughts fell on this elixir, the corresponding information also appeared.</p><p></p><p>This is an elixir used by Blood Refining realm cultivators, which can refine the cultivator's qi and blood power, accelerating the breakthrough to the Blood Refining realm. Even Skin Refining perfected cultivators can take it to enter the Blood Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>"Can these two upgrade points allow the Collapse Mountain Fist to break through to an even higher level?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the Collapse Mountain Fist, and a thought flashed through his mind, and an information prompt appeared.</p><p></p><p>Break through the Collapse Mountain Fist's limit! Requires 5 Upgrade Points!</p><p></p><p>It can indeed be doneâ€”</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was delighted. The perfection of the Collapse Mountain Fist has already allowed him to break through to Skin Refining perfection. If he can break through to an even higher level, then perhaps he can directly become a Blood Refining cultivator relying on the Collapse Mountain Fist.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>After seeing that it requires 5 upgrade points to break through the limit, Gu Qingfeng furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>The upgrade points required to break through the limit are not few.</p><p></p><p>Up to now, all the upgrade points he has obtained add up to only four points.</p><p></p><p>To truly accumulate five points, it will not be a matter of a year or two.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the Iron Body Technique.</p><p></p><p>"Since I can't upgrade the Collapse Mountain Fist, then I'll focus on upgrading the Iron Body Technique first. As for the future, I'll deal with it later. For now, the main thing is to improve my own strength as much as possible!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

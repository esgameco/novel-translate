        <h1>Chapter 51</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at him, his expression neither sorrowful nor joyful.</p><p></p><p>"It's simple, ordinary people are like livestock in your eyes, and you are no different than livestock in my eyes."</p><p></p><p>"How could I, Gu, cooperate with livestock?"</p><p></p><p>"But you can rest assured, after you die, I will quickly send the other people of the Qingyang Sect down to accompany you!"</p><p></p><p>As Gu Qingfeng's words fell, his right hand directly snapped the other's neck.</p><p></p><p>Until death.</p><p></p><p>Xue Wang's face was filled with unwillingness.</p><p></p><p>"Come here!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng spoke without expression.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>Two guards walked in from outside.</p><p></p><p>"What are the master's orders!"</p><p></p><p>"Drag the body out, chop it up and feed it to the dogs."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng waved his hand, directly letting the people drag Xue Wang's body out, and the two guards dared not ask more, only following the instructions.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>In the dungeon, only Gu Qingfeng remained.</p><p></p><p>After a long time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng suddenly smiled, but the smile was slightly ferocious.</p><p></p><p>"All the people under heaven are like livestock, this world is more twisted than I imagined. Without the corresponding strength, one may become the food of various sects, families, and even the court at any time!"</p><p></p><p>The world is in great chaos.</p><p></p><p>Natural disasters are rampant.</p><p></p><p>Bandits and rebels are rampant.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had thought he had already estimated the chaos of this world to the best of his ability, but now it seems that he had underestimated it, and seriously underestimated it.</p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Dynasty!</p><p></p><p>No—</p><p></p><p>It should be said that the order of this world has already completely decayed.</p><p></p><p>The major sects and families have stood for hundreds or even thousands of years, poisoning the common people.</p><p></p><p>The decay of this world seems to have no meaning of salvation.</p><p></p><p>Overthrowing everything and re-establishing order may be the fundamental solution.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>These things are temporarily not related to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention whether he has the idea of overthrowing this decaying world, even if he does, he is powerless.</p><p></p><p>Because.</p><p></p><p>He is too weak.</p><p></p><p>The Xisui Realm seems very strong, but it depends on where. Trying to be an enemy of the whole world, not to mention the Xisui Realm, even a Xiantong Master would not be enough.</p><p></p><p>"I can't overthrow the world, and I can't destroy this decaying world, but solving the Qingyang Sect is not a problem.</p><p></p><p>As long as Xue Wang's words are not false, my strength should be enough to suppress and kill the Qingyang Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>"As long as the Qingyang Ancestor is eliminated, the rest of the Qingyang Sect will be negligible!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes turned cold.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>The matter of destroying the Qingyang Sect must be planned and then acted upon.</p><p></p><p>At least.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also used his own people to investigate some intelligence about the Qingyang Sect, and compared it with what Xue Wang said, to confirm that there was no problem.</p><p></p><p>At the same time—</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also needs to prepare two hands.</p><p></p><p>That is, if the Gu family's attack on the Qingyang Sect fails, they must prepare a retreat.</p><p></p><p>After all, if the strength of the Qingyang Ancestor is so powerful that even he cannot deal with it, then the Gu family cannot continue to stay in the Baishi Road.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would be easy for the Qingyang Sect to deal with the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>As for reconciliation, that is even more impossible.</p><p></p><p>From the moment Ye Shi died, the Gu family has been at irreconcilable enmity with the Qingyang Sect.</p><p></p><p>Moreover.</p><p></p><p>If the Gu family wants to bow to the Qingyang Sect, they have to collect three thousand boys and girls for the Qingyang Sect, and Gu Qingfeng admits that he is ruthless, but he still cannot do this.</p><p></p><p>"According to Xue Wang's account, in the past it was the Qin family who did these things for the Qingyang Sect.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It can be seen that the Qin family had considerable reputation and prestige on the surface of the White Stone Road, but behind the scenes, they were extremely dirty.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that when we originally exterminated the Qin family, not a single one was killed by mistake!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's heart turned cold.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had destroyed the Qin family because they had torn off the facade, and he wanted to directly root them out.</p><p></p><p>But now, looking at it...</p><p></p><p>The extermination of the Qin family was indeed not at all unjust.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>Two days later.</p><p></p><p>In the Gu family's main hall.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said in a deep voice, "According to my father's request, I have mobilized all our people to investigate the situation of the Qingyang Sect these past two days. These are the collected materials, please take a look, Father!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Gu Yang handed a stack of papers to Gu Qingfeng, who took them and began to read them carefully.</p><p></p><p>The content on the papers was more or less the same as what Xue Wang had said.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said, "Ten years ago, a swordsman from Nanyang named Guan Nanhai went to the Qingyang Sect and killed one person with a single sword strike, causing quite a stir. But at least after that, Guan Nanhai disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Some people rumored that Guan Nanhai was killed inside the Qingyang Sect, but the specific details are not yet known."</p><p></p><p>Pausing here, Gu Yang's expression suddenly became grave.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the Nanyang swordsman back then had extremely powerful abilities, suspected to have reached the Xiu Shou realm, and had defeated many strong experts, earning a fearsome reputation throughout the entire Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Guan Nanhai's subsequent disappearance also caused quite a commotion, but over time, it was forgotten.</p><p></p><p>It's just a pity that I couldn't find out the true strength of Guan Nanhai."</p><p></p><p>"No need to investigate further, Guan Nanhai did indeed reach the Xiu Shou realm, and he was indeed killed inside the Qingyang Sect!" Gu Qingfeng smiled slightly, forcefully shattering the papers in his hand with a gust of wind.</p><p></p><p>The content recorded here was more or less the same as what Xue Wang had said, or even less detailed. For example, the existence of the Qingyang Patriarch was only briefly mentioned, with just a simple sentence saying that he had founded the Qingyang Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Guan Nanhai was truly at the Xiu Shou realm!" Gu Yang's expression changed, and his face then turned grim.</p><p></p><p>"If what Father says is true, then the foundation of the Qingyang Sect is likely not as simple as it appears on the surface. If we are to tear off the facade with the Qingyang Sect, does Father have any plans?"</p><p></p><p>"The foundation of the Qingyang Sect is indeed not simple, but I don't think it will be a major problem. The one who slew Guan Nanhai was none other than the Qingyang Patriarch, who established the Qingyang Sect hundreds of years ago."</p><p></p><p>"That's impossible, the Qingyang Patriarch was a figure from hundreds of years ago, how could an ordinary cultivator live that long?" Gu Yang's expression was filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he didn't believe Gu Qingfeng's words, but what he said had shattered Gu Yang's own understanding.</p><p></p><p>It was true that cultivators could prolong their lifespan, but not to the extent of living for hundreds of years.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "Ordinary cultivators cannot live for hundreds of years, but if they are Sect Masters, then living for hundreds of years is not a problem."</p><p></p><p>"However, the one from the Qingyang Sect is not a Sect Master, but rather a demonic being who has integrated evil into his body, neither human nor ghost. His strength, although stronger than Guan Nanhai's, is likely limited."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression changed repeatedly upon hearing Gu Qingfeng's words.</p><p></p><p>Sect Master! Integrated evil into his body!</p><p></p><p>He suddenly realized that he had been like a frog at the bottom of a well, lacking understanding of many things.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng glanced at him.</p><p></p><p>"There are some things that I will tell you in the future. You only need to understand one thing: integrating evil into one's body is not the righteous path, and the Gu family will never allow anyone to do so. Whoever dares to integrate evil into their body, I will be the first to kill them!"</p><p></p><p>"I understand, son!" Gu Yang's heart trembled as he felt the killing intent emanating from Gu Qingfeng, and he hurriedly bowed his head in response.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

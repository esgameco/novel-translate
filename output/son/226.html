        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Outside the Whetstone Hall, a sound came. Gu Qingfeng opened his eyes, and a terrifying aura of the blade flashed and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Come in!"</p><p></p><p>He spoke.</p><p></p><p>The tightly closed doors of the Whetstone Hall were opened as if by an invisible hand, and Red Leaf walked in from the outside.</p><p></p><p>"I have a message from the imperial palace, please take a look, Your Highness!"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she presented a secret letter with both hands.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng opened the secret letter and glanced at it, his gaze slightly shifting.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, </p><p></p><p>he looked at the information panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' encountered an invading enemy and suppressed a sixth-stage Shenbian Realm cultivator by severing his finger!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' suppressed someone from the Guiyuan Empire!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang'..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The Guiyuan Empire!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>When he saw that Gu Yang had suppressed a sixth-stage Shenbian Realm cultivator by severing his finger, Gu Qingfeng understood where that severed finger came from.</p><p></p><p>Although that severed finger was left behind when he had just entered the Daogong Realm, it was incomparable to his current cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But even so,</p><p></p><p>that severed finger still possessed the divine might of the Daogong Realm.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing a sixth-stage Shenbian Realm cultivator was naturally nothing shocking.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng left the Whetstone Hall and headed to the imperial city.</p><p></p><p>In less than half a day,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng entered the imperial city.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang also came to see him immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Son pays respects to Father!"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that cultivators from outside the Nine Realms have invaded. Where are they now?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng asked directly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said, "I have already imprisoned them all in the Celestial Prison, waiting for Father to come and interrogate them!"</p><p></p><p>Regarding such powerful experts, Gu Yang knew it would not be easy to make them speak the truth, so he simply invited Gu Qingfeng to come and see if he had any means to make them talk.</p><p></p><p>More importantly,</p><p></p><p>the forces behind Han An and the others involved the Guiyuan Empire, and Gu Yang did not dare to be careless.</p><p></p><p>The Guiyuan Empire! </p><p></p><p>That was a power that surpassed the dynasties.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had become the ruler of a dynasty, Gu Yang naturally understood how powerful it was to control the destiny of a dynasty.</p><p></p><p>If it was just a dynasty, it was already so powerful.</p><p></p><p>If it was an empire,</p><p></p><p>then it would be even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>In the dim and damp Celestial Prison, the air was filled with the smell of moisture and moss.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng and Gu Yang walked into the Celestial Prison, without any other guards following them.</p><p></p><p>"This Celestial Prison is divided into nine layers, the first five layers are for holding ordinary criminals, and the last four layers are for housing masters and above-level experts."</p><p></p><p>"Now, those two people are temporarily being held in the ninth layer of the Celestial Prison, which is entirely made of mysterious iron. Even if a grand master exerts their full strength, it would be difficult for them to truly escape."</p><p></p><p>"If Shenbian Realm experts are imprisoned, as long as their cultivation is not fully recovered, they can also be suppressed!"</p><p></p><p>After entering the Celestial Prison, Gu Yang patiently explained to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>To build this Celestial Prison, he had spent a lot of effort.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious iron used for the ninth layer of the Celestial Prison was a rare treasure in the Nine Realms. Even if ordinary people obtained a small amount and mixed it into their weapons, they could forge divine weapons that could cut through iron like mud.</p><p></p><p>This shows how precious the mysterious iron was.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Yang was not the ruler of the Nine Realms, he would not have been able to gather so much mysterious iron to build the ninth layer of the Celestial Prison.</p><p></p><p>When the two entered the ninth layer of the Celestial Prison, the place was as bright as daylight.</p><p></p><p>In the two adjacent cells, an old man and a young man were imprisoned.</p><p></p><p>The two were covered in blood, their ribs pierced by iron hooks, but their wounds did not bleed.</p><p></p><p>After hearing the sound of someone approaching, the old man, Ke Lao, leaning against the wall, opened his cloudy eyes and coldly smiled at Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>"Old man advises you to be sensible and let us go. The Guiyuan Empire is not someone you can offend, even if you have Daogong Realm experts guarding your Divine Martial Kingdom. </p><p></p><p>The Guiyuan Empire has countless experts, and the number of Daogong Realm experts alone is not small.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, we have left soul tokens in the Guiyuan Empire. If we perish, the imperial court will immediately sense it."</p><p></p><p>"When the imperial army of the Guiyuan Empire arrives at the Nine Realms, you will regret it too late!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, Ke Lao was not very panicked, still trying to intimidate with the power of the Guiyuan Empire.</p><p></p><p>In his view, since Gu Yang had not killed him, he must be wary of the Guiyuan Empire, and would not dare to act rashly. After all, even in the Eastern Domain, the Guiyuan Empire was a powerful force, and the Divine Martial Kingdom was nothing in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>faced with Ke Lao's words, Gu Yang's expression remained indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"I'll give you one more chance. Tell me the purpose of your coming and all the information about the Guiyuan Empire, and perhaps I'll spare your life."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>Ke Lao snorted coldly without answering.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression suddenly turned cold, then he looked at Gu Qingfeng beside him.</p><p></p><p>"This person is a half-step Daogong Realm expert from the Guiyuan Empire. Unfortunately, his mouth is too stubborn, so I'll have Father take care of him."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Gu Yang's words, Ke Lao finally looked at Gu Qingfeng beside him, his expression somewhat doubtful and uncertain.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the Martial Saint Gu Qingfeng?"</p><p></p><p>This name,</p><p></p><p>Ke Lao was not unfamiliar with.</p><p></p><p>But in his calculations, this person should be at the Shenbian Realm, so if Gu Yang hadn't mentioned it, Ke Lao would have almost mistaken him for an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this,</p><p></p><p>Ke Lao's heart was shocked again.</p><p></p><p>Even though his cultivation was sealed, a Shenbian Realm cultivator should not be able to hide their strength from him, but now he could not see through the other party's true power, which was quite intriguing.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you've heard of my existence."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stepped in front of Ke Lao, looking at him calmly.</p><p></p><p>To this,</p><p></p><p>Ke Lao remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head, "Judging from your attitude, even if I ask, you won't be willing to speak. Well, since you don't want to talk, let me take a look myself!"</p><p></p><p>"You want to search my soul!"</p><p></p><p>Ke Lao seemed to have thought of something, his expression suddenly changing drastically, but then he sneered contemptuously.</p><p></p><p>"You think you can search this old man's soul? Dream on—"</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>before Ke Lao could finish speaking, a terrifying spiritual force from Gu Qingfeng had already forcefully invaded his spiritual sea.</p><p></p><p>At that moment,</p><p></p><p>Ke Lao's face changed drastically, and his gaze became filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>"Daogong—"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he uttered these two words, his expression became dull.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's spiritual sense rampaged through the other's memories, quickly finding a lot of information.</p><p></p><p>The only regret was that the person in front of him was a half-step Daogong Realm expert. Although he had not truly opened the Daogong Realm and cultivated his primordial spirit, his spiritual sense was still quite powerful.</p><p></p><p>And with the other party having lived for thousands of years, his memories were extremely long. Even though Gu Qingfeng now wanted to thoroughly examine all his memories, it was still difficult to do so.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>despite this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng still obtained the information he wanted.</p><p></p><p>"The Guiyuan Empire!"</p><p></p><p>"Imperial worship!"</p><p></p><p>"Beast control technique... Saint's inheritance!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured, his gaze towards the other party now filled with understanding.</p><p></p><p>In Ke Lao's memories, the Guiyuan Empire was established by a half-Saint expert ten thousand years ago.</p><p></p><p>Since then,</p><p></p><p>the power of the Guiyuan Empire has been growing stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>By now,</p><p></p><p>although the Guiyuan Empire no longer has a half-Saint-level expert at its core, it does have several Daogong Realm experts, and the one who controls the Guiyuan Empire, Emperor Han, is even a ninth-stage Daogong Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>As long as he does not encounter any unexpected calamity, he has a high chance of stepping into the half-Saint realm in the future.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also understood why Ke Lao and the others were able to find the Nine Realms.</p><p></p><p>They knew the beast control technique, using a large number of fierce beasts to roam the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, and then based on the feedback from these fierce beasts, they were able to locate the Nine Realms.</p><p></p><p>It has to be said,</p><p></p><p>this kind of method is quite surprising to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>It also indirectly explains the root cause of why the fierce beasts have been causing more and more trouble in the Nine Realms recently.</p><p></p><p>As for the purpose of the two, it was just as Gu Qingfeng had guessed - they came for the Saint's inheritance.</p><p></p><p>Even for the Guiyuan Empire, which once had a half-Saint expert at its core, the Saint's inheritance was extremely valuable.</p><p></p><p>The difference in strength between having the Saint's inheritance and not having it was heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng's spiritual sense withdrew, Ke Lao's face was deathly pale, and his gaze towards Gu Qingfeng was filled with both terror and mockery.</p><p></p><p>"You already know the strength of my Guiyuan Empire. If you release us now, there is still room for negotiation, otherwise it will be a dead end—"</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Before Ke Lao could finish speaking, Gu Qingfeng flicked his finger, causing his head to explode and him to die on the spot.</p><p></p><p>While Shenbian Realm experts could regenerate their severed limbs, they could not regrow their heads once they were destroyed.</p><p></p><p>"Ke Lao!!"</p><p></p><p>In the adjacent cell, Han An, seeing the headless corpse, could no longer suppress the terror in his heart, and when he looked at Gu Qingfeng, his face was filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>"Don't kill me!"</p><p></p><p>"I am the Sixth Prince of the Guiyuan Empire. If you kill me, my father the Emperor will not let you off!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Gu Qingfeng did not respond, but instead came directly to his cell, Han An's heart became even more terrified.</p><p></p><p>"I'll talk!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll say anything, just don't kill me... don't..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke,</p><p></p><p>a warm flow had already leaked from Han An's crotch, the Sixth Prince of the Guiyuan Empire had been completely frightened out of his wits.</p><p></p><p>"I still believe what I've seen."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head, then immediately used his methods to search Han An's mind.</p><p></p><p>Searching Han An's memories was much easier than searching Ke Lao's, after all, the gap in their cultivation was not small. The former was only at the sixth stage of the Shenbian Realm, while the latter had already reached the half-step Daogong Realm.</p><p></p><p>Soon,</p><p></p><p>Han An's memories were thoroughly searched.</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Qingfeng was about to focus on searching for the cultivation techniques of the Guiyuan Empire, suddenly, a huge spiritual sense abruptly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to pry into the inheritance of my Guiyuan Empire? Seek death!"</p><p></p><p>The spiritual sense erupted. Such a terrifying aura could crush ordinary Daogong Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Qingfeng's eyes turned cold, and he responded with his own spiritual sense in kind.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Suppression.</p><p></p><p>"Boom—"</p><p></p><p>The two forces collided, and the divine sense was easily crushed.</p><p></p><p>But in the moment the divine sense was suppressed, Han An's head also exploded, without a trace of life.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Han An's death, Gu Qingfeng shook his head with some regret.</p><p></p><p>The Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty was a top-tier force, and it had also produced half-saints in the past. The inheritance of this force must not be underestimated, and it might even be stronger than the inheritance of the Divine Yang Holy Land.</p><p></p><p>Han An, as the Sixth Prince of the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty, had a high chance of possessing the complete inheritance of the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>What a pity.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of his sea of consciousness, a powerful cultivator had laid down a prohibition. If any cultivator dared to explore and search for its inheritance memories, this power would be triggered.</p><p></p><p>This prohibition was either to kill the intruder, or if it couldn't be killed, it would erase the vessel to prevent the leakage of the imperial dynasty's inheritance.</p><p></p><p>Recalling that vast divine sense, there was the overbearing aura of an emperor. Gu Qingfeng suspected that it was the Yuanxuan Emperor, Han.</p><p></p><p>A peak expert at the Dao Palace Realm, ninth layer.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Although Han's strength was formidable, the remnant divine sense he left in Han An was only a fraction, and naturally, it could not be Gu Qingfeng's opponent.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao Palace Realm, ninth layer, doesn't seem as strong as I imagined!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes flickered slightly, then quickly recovered.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at the deceased Han An and couldn't help but ask, "Father, how did the soul search turn out?"</p><p></p><p>"It's almost done. Originally, I wanted to obtain the inheritance of the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty from this child, but unfortunately, his sea of consciousness had a Dao Palace prohibition. When someone tried to search his soul, this prohibition would be triggered."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said regretfully.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang's expression became somewhat grave, and then he instructed the jailers behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Clean up these corpses!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The jailers immediately carried out the order.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>The Primal Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Domain.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>In the imperial court, a middle-aged emperor sat on the throne, his expression solemn. His deep black eyes were as profound as an abyss, and his brows exuded the overbearing aura of an emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm..."</p><p></p><p>The Yuanxuan Emperor, who was originally listening to the reports of the ministers below, suddenly frowned, and then his eyes shot out a cold and murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to pry into the inheritance of my Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty!"</p><p></p><p>Before the words had even faded, a tyrannical and unparalleled aura suddenly erupted, causing the vast imperial court to be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>All the ministers changed expression, and under that oppressive aura, they instinctively knelt on the ground, their bodies trembling.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Yuanxuan Emperor also realized his outburst, and the aura around him quickly receded, allowing the ministers to slowly stand up, still trembling.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, an elder minister cupped his hands and asked, "May I ask why Your Majesty is so enraged?"</p><p></p><p>"The prohibition on the Sixth Prince's inheritance has been triggered!"</p><p></p><p>The Yuanxuan Emperor uttered a sentence, and upon hearing this, the ministers' expressions changed again.</p><p></p><p>They naturally understood the meaning of the inheritance prohibition the Yuanxuan Emperor mentioned. When the inheritance prohibition was triggered, it meant that someone had dared to attempt a soul search.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, after the Yuanxuan Emperor's anger had subsided, he was also pondering who the culprit might be.</p><p></p><p>After all, although Han An's strength was not strong, the other party had the protection of the imperial clan and Ke Lao, who had one foot in the Dao Palace Realm. Their strength was not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Han An also had a life-saving trump card bestowed by the imperial clan.</p><p></p><p>Normally, even if he encountered danger, he should have been able to escape without much trouble.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Han An was backed by the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty, and other forces should have known this.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the Yuanxuan Emperor thought of something.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a guard hurriedly entered and cupped his hands to the Yuanxuan Emperor, saying, "Your Majesty, the soul tokens of Ke Lao and the Sixth Prince have been shattered!"</p><p></p><p>These words shocked the entire court.</p><p></p><p>The shattering of the soul tokens meant that the ones who had left the soul tokens behind had perished.</p><p></p><p>If it was just the death of an imperial clan protector, it would have been fine, but now a prince had also died, the consequences were far-reaching.</p><p></p><p>However, the Yuanxuan Emperor did not seem as furious as expected. When he learned that someone had attempted a soul search to seize the imperial dynasty's inheritance, he had already anticipated Han An's fate.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the other party had completely torn off the mask with the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>"Dismiss the court!"</p><p></p><p>The Yuanxuan Emperor said coldly, directly announcing the dismissal of the court.</p><p></p><p>The ministers dared not say anything more and could only bow and withdraw, except for one person who remained standing.</p><p></p><p>After everyone had left, the Yuanxuan Emperor looked at the person in front of him and said, "An'er, I ordered you to enter the Ancient Beast Mountain Range to search for the traces of the Saint's inheritance. Now that you and Ke Lao have perished, it is likely related to the Saint's inheritance."</p><p></p><p>"You must immediately lead the Divine Emperor Army to the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, and you must bring back the Saint's inheritance. Also, find out who killed An'er."</p><p></p><p>"Any who dare to oppose my Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty will only have the path of death!"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, the Yuanxuan Emperor's face was filled with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>He had many descendants, and the loss of just one Sixth Prince would not have enraged him so much.</p><p></p><p>What truly angered the Yuanxuan Emperor was that the other party had slapped the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty in the face, and it was likely related to the Saint's inheritance.</p><p></p><p>These two were what the Yuanxuan Emperor truly valued.</p><p></p><p>The person in front of him was Jing Meng, a great general of the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty, whose cultivation had already reached the Dao Palace Realm, seventh layer. He could be considered one of the top experts in the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty, and his Divine Emperor Army of a hundred thousand was also extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Yuanxuan Emperor had ordered Jing Meng to lead the Divine Emperor Army into the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, it showed how important this matter was to him.</p><p></p><p>"I will carry out the order!"</p><p></p><p>Jing Meng cupped his hands and accepted the command.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Back in the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng informed Gu Yang of all the information he had obtained from the soul search.</p><p></p><p>"The Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty is not weak, it is a top-tier imperial dynasty in the Eastern Domain, created by a half-saint expert ten thousand years ago. After that half-saint perished, the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty's strength did not decline much.</p><p></p><p>As the old man said, they all had soul tokens left in the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty, and now that the two have perished, the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty must have learned of the news."</p><p></p><p>These words made Gu Yang's expression become extremely serious.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Palace Realm was an existence that surpassed the Divine Change Realm. The Dao Palace Realm, ninth layer, was almost able to step one foot into the Saint Realm.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful expert naturally made Gu Yang feel immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>"What is the purpose of the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty in coming here?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang asked the question on his mind.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng calmly replied, "They have come here only to obtain the Saint's inheritance."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng also mentioned the matters regarding the Divine Martial Sect and Mu Rong Xiu, and at this point, Gu Yang finally truly understood the purpose of the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty, as well as the challenges the Divine Martial Kingdom would face in the future.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Qingfeng and the four Gu Family Elders were not counted, the Divine Martial Kingdom could be said to not have a single Divine Change Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Even if the four Divine Change Realm, ninth layer Elders were included, they would still be somewhat lacking in the face of the Dao Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty had a Dao Palace Realm, ninth layer expert as its pillar.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Gu Yang couldn't help but look at Gu Qingfeng and asked, "Father, what is your current cultivation level? If the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty were to attack, how much chance would you have?"</p><p></p><p>"For now, just consider me to be at the Dao Palace Realm. As long as the Saint does not appear, the problems should not be too great."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered for a moment and revealed a bit about his own strength.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, although he was currently only at the Dao Palace Realm, fourth layer, his foundation was far beyond what the Dao Palace Realm, fourth layer could match.</p><p></p><p>From the prohibition in Han An's sea of consciousness, it seemed that even the Dao Palace Realm, ninth layer was not as strong as he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, even if he were to face a Dao Palace Realm, ninth layer expert, Gu Qingfeng would have the confidence to fight.</p><p></p><p>These words gave Gu Yang a great sense of security, and his gaze towards Gu Qingfeng was filled with admiration.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Saint does not appear, there would be no major problems.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't that mean that even if the Dao Palace Realm, ninth layer expert from the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty were to come in person, there would still be no significant issues? Taking a deep breath, Gu Yang said, "With Father's words, I am now at ease. Since they are here for the Saint's inheritance, then the two from the Yuanxuan Imperial Dynasty are just the beginning.</p><p></p><p>I will order people to thoroughly search all the states, and closely monitor the Ancient Beast Mountain Range. If any other powerful experts from the Eastern Domain were to come, the court will be the first to know."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore—"</p><p></p><p>"I think the White Stone Dao is too small, how about I find a place in the imperial capital to serve as the foundation of the Gu Family Manor?"</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Gu Qingfeng's response, Gu Yang smiled bitterly and continued.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not afraid of Father's ridicule, but in the current situation, the court ultimately lacks powerful experts to guard it. If Father were to take up residence in the imperial capital, I believe it would solve many troubles.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if Father is unwilling, I will not force you."</p><p></p><p>Although he said this, the burning gaze in Gu Yang's eyes made Gu Qingfeng understand that he had no way to refuse.</p><p></p><p>But for Gu Qingfeng, whether the Gu Family Manor was in the White Stone Dao or in the imperial capital, it made no difference.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since you have brought it up, your father will grant your wish."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded in agreement, in the expectant gaze of the other.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Good, then Father can rest here in the imperial palace first. I will immediately order people to move the Gu Family Manor here. Now, in the imperial capital, which place does Father want to use as the residence of the Gu Family Manor?"</p><p></p><p>"You can arrange it as you see fit."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng waved his hand, not caring about these matters.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang did not hesitate. He first had people arrange for Gu Qingfeng to rest, then immediately set out to find a suitable place in the imperial capital to serve as the new Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also took action on the White Stone Dao side.</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family Manor had taken root in the White Stone Dao for decades, and its foundation was also quite solid. Now that it was to be relocated, it was not a simple task.</p><p></p><p>But with Gu Yang mobilizing the power of the court, these matters became much simpler.</p><p></p><p>In less than ten days, the massive Gu Family Manor had been completely moved to the imperial capital.</p><p></p><p>The former Guangyang Wang Fu had now been completely rebuilt by Gu Yang and became the new Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>This news shook the imperial capital.</p><p></p><p>On the day the Gu Family Manor reopened, various officials and powerful forces in the jianghu all came to pay visits. Gu Qingfeng did not personally deal with them, only letting Gu Peng handle the matters, while he himself continued to cultivate and comprehend the Primal Chaos Heaven Sword. (End of the chapter)</p>

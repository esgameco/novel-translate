        <h1>Chapter 106</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The next breath.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red blade light sliced through the air.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the horrified and desperate gazes of the crowd, the one known as the Divine Fist Vajra, Jizong, was cleaved in half in mid-air. The long sword was then sheathed, and the blood-red blade light dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Silence! A deathly silence!</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the rebel army or the Gu family's side, all eyes were on Gu Qingfeng, each face filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Qingfeng's half-step Sect Master level strength, slaying a Refining Bone Perfected martial artist was naturally not a shocking feat.</p><p></p><p>But the problem was...</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not truly take action, yet his sword behind him acted on its own and slew a Refining Bone Perfected martial artist - this was an entirely different concept!</p><p></p><p>An immortal? </p><p></p><p>Commanding a sword to slay enemies from thousands of miles away? No.</p><p></p><p>It should be said that he commanded a blade to slay enemies.</p><p></p><p>Although not as exaggerated as thousands of miles, being able to slay a Refining Bone Perfected martial artist from ten paces away still made one's neck feel a chill.</p><p></p><p>Even Gu Yang, at this moment, had a shocked expression, not expecting his father's strength to be so terrifying.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Gu Qingfeng slowly walked up to the middle-aged military commander.</p><p></p><p>"Why have you and your subordinates under Fei Jingwei come here to wantonly slaughter?" he asked.</p><p></p><p>These words, falling upon the middle-aged military commander's ears, made the latter's body tremble, and he forced out an ugly smile.</p><p></p><p>"If I tell you, will the lord of the Gu Residence spare my life?"</p><p></p><p>"You do not have the right to negotiate conditions. Telling the truth will be the best course of action for you. If I have to act, even death may be a luxury."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was indifferent, but his words made the middle-aged military commander's heart freeze with fear.</p><p></p><p>He understood.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was not just bluffing.</p><p></p><p>The methods of a cultivator at such a level would not be so simple.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the middle-aged military commander did not even have the thought of fleeing.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, Gu Qingfeng's strike had not only slain Jizong, but also severed the middle-aged military commander's will to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Lord of the Gu Residence, please feel free to ask, I will truthfully answer everything I know. I only hope that you will grant me a quick death."</p><p></p><p>"Then I shall ask, what is the purpose of you and your men entering Guangyang Prefecture, and why are you slaughtering the common people now?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng asked.</p><p></p><p>If it were just random plundering, the possibility would be low.</p><p></p><p>And the people of Red Rock Village had died in such a tragic manner, far from a simple slaughter.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged military commander said, "The King has ordered us to enter Guangyang Prefecture to collect the fresh blood and viscera of the common people, to be sacrificed to the evil Buddha in the Nine Twists Dao."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Qingfeng's eyes instantly turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"So you're saying that Fei Jing intends to nourish that evil Buddha, and then let it emerge from the Nine Twists Dao to disrupt the situation in Guangyang Prefecture?"</p><p></p><p>He did not expect Fei Jing's methods to be so ruthless.</p><p></p><p>If the evil Buddha were to emerge from the Nine Twists Dao, Guangyang Prefecture would undoubtedly be thrown into chaos.</p><p></p><p>At that time, how many more lives would be lost, it was impossible to know.</p><p></p><p>But the evil Buddha's emergence would have already decimated half of the Nine Twists Dao, with countless casualties among the common people, turning the vast Nine Twists Dao into a forbidden and desolate area.</p><p></p><p>If the evil Buddha truly emerged, Gu Qingfeng could hardly imagine the scale of the disaster it would bring.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the Gu Family Residence would not be spared either.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Gu Qingfeng coldly asked, "If the evil Buddha emerges and brings calamity to the world, even if Fei Jing conquers Guangyang Prefecture, how can they hope to subdue the evil Buddha?"</p><p></p><p>"This, I am not sure about. But the King was born in the Tianya Sword Sect, which is a truly immortal sect."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the Tianyang Sword Sect can deal with the evil Buddha!" </p><p></p><p>The middle-aged military commander shook his head, not daring to hide anything, and told everything he knew.</p><p></p><p>From the other party's words, Gu Qingfeng could know that the rebels who had entered Guangyang Prefecture were not just the one in front of them.</p><p></p><p>These rebels were acting in small groups, and even if the court wanted to completely block them, it would be impossible.</p><p></p><p>Their purpose was to slaughter the common people in various places and offer their flesh and blood as sacrifices to the evil Buddha of the Nine-Curve Dao, so that the evil Buddha could emerge from the Nine-Curve Dao and thoroughly disrupt the situation in Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>As long as the evil Buddha emerged, Guangyang Prefecture would inevitably fall into chaos. </p><p></p><p>At that time, the great army of the Shenwu King could take advantage of the chaos and directly conquer the entire Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>In addition, to be on the safe side, these rebels would not assault the towns, but only kill some villages with weak defenses along the way.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that the other party had explained everything clearly, Gu Qingfeng released a gust of wind from his fingertips, causing the head of the middle-aged military commander to explode, and the headless corpse immediately fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>With the death of the middle-aged military commander, Gu Qingfeng drew his sword and immediately charged towards the other rebels.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Yang shouted angrily. </p><p></p><p>The other surviving disciples of the Gu family also rose up and charged towards the remaining rebels.</p><p></p><p>After the deaths of Seasonal Sect Master and the middle-aged military commander, the previously intimidated rebels were now driven by a strong desire to survive and scattered in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, although these rebels were numerous, they were nothing in the face of Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>With his fierce sword intent and powerful palm strikes, Gu Qingfeng slaughtered most of them in an instant, not even allowing them to leave the Red Rock Village.</p><p></p><p>The remaining few rebels were then completely eliminated by Gu Yang and his men.</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang, his clothes stained with blood, came before Gu Qingfeng and bowed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at his disheveled appearance, furrowed his brows, and then tossed him a bottle of golden ointment.</p><p></p><p>"Treat your injuries, and then burn all the corpses clean. We'll discuss the rest when we return."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang did not dare to say more. He simply applied the golden ointment to his wounds, and the powder's contact with the wound caused him to frown slightly from the intense pain, but that was all.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a great fire was lit in Red Rock Village, and all the bodies of the rebels and villagers were reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>However, as Gu Qingfeng watched the raging fire, he felt a lingering cold aura that he could not shake off.</p><p></p><p>"The world is in chaos!"</p><p>"The people cannot live in peace!"</p><p>"It seems that something ominous is about to emerge in Red Rock Village..."</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng had not witnessed the birth of the ominous entity, he had a premonition that with so many people dying such brutal deaths, their resentment could very well give rise to an ominous entity.</p><p></p><p>But when exactly this ominous entity would emerge, Gu Qingfeng did not know.</p><p></p><p>"Go back and inform the others that an ominous entity is about to appear in Red Rock Village. There is no need for anyone to come here!"</p><p></p><p>This was what Gu Qingfeng said to Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>The latter nodded in acknowledgment.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Receiving praise.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's face grew increasingly joyful.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the other party and said, "Since you have advanced to the Refining Skin stage, today I shall pass on the complete Collapse Mountain Fist to you!"</p><p></p><p>"The complete Collapse Mountain Fist?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>He had been cultivating the Collapse Mountain Fist for several years, and naturally understood that this martial art was not considered a profound and esoteric skill, but rather a low-level one.</p><p></p><p>For a martial artist of this level, being able to reach the Refining Skin stage was already the limit.</p><p></p><p>As a martial artist, Gu Yang naturally knew that the Collapse Mountain Fist he had cultivated was not incomplete.</p><p></p><p>So when he heard Gu Qingfeng's words, he was a bit dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "The Collapse Mountain Fist is not as simple as you think. Your father used this martial art to enter the Refining Blood realm, and with your talent, it is certain that you will one day break through the Refining Blood realm.</p><p></p><p>Since you have broken through today, I might as well teach you the complete Collapse Mountain Fist, hoping that you will cultivate it well!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not waste any more words, but began to demonstrate the brand-new Collapse Mountain Fist right in front of Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the limit, this martial art had become different, with corresponding adjustments in various aspects of breath regulation and blood qi mobilization methods.</p><p></p><p>These slight changes were like the finishing touches on a painting, making Gu Yang's gaze gradually brighten.</p><p></p><p>And when the last punch was struck, Gu Qingfeng's blood qi turned into billowing smoke, and his powerful fist seemed capable of shattering mountains and crumbling ridges.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>A punch was thrown.</p><p></p><p>Thunderous roar suddenly arose.</p><p></p><p>Surging gales ravaged the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The artificial mountain dozens of feet away was shattered at that moment, turning into countless flying debris.</p><p></p><p>This scene,</p><p></p><p>left Gu Yang completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>In the face of this punch, he felt his own insignificance, and the joy and pride he had just experienced from breaking through the Refining Skin stage vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Without witnessing the strike of a Refining Blood realm martial artist, one could never truly experience the strength of this level.</p><p></p><p>After the set of fist techniques was completed, Gu Qingfeng calmed his turbulent blood qi and looked at the dumbfounded Gu Yang with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>"This is the complete Collapse Mountain Fist. This martial art was originally a low-level skill, but later your father gained some insights and broke through its limits, making it comparable to mid-level martial arts.</p><p></p><p>As long as you cultivate it to perfection, you can directly enter the Refining Blood realm."</p><p></p><p>At this point,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang finally snapped out of his dazed state, and couldn't help but say, "In that case, the Collapse Mountain Fist can be considered your own creation."</p><p></p><p>"Not exactly a creation, but rather some minor innovations and breakthroughs based on the foundations of previous practitioners," Gu Qingfeng said modestly, but Gu Yang was well aware of how difficult it was to break through the limits of a martial art.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>when he looked at Gu Qingfeng again, his gaze was filled with admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Since this martial art is your own breakthrough and innovation, if we continue to call it the Collapse Mountain Fist, I feel it may not be quite appropriate.</p><p></p><p>In my opinion, we should call it the Gu Family Fist instead!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Family Fist! Hearing this name, Gu Qingfeng was slightly taken aback, but then he nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Then let it be called the Gu Family Fist."</p><p></p><p>Perfectly.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family also needed a martial art to uphold its reputation.</p><p></p><p>The Collapse Mountain Fist may not be a widely practiced technique, but it is still known to many martial artists. Using it as the Gu family's signature style would not be very impressive.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Collapse Mountain Fist has been broken through and refined, it has become a different fist technique, so calling it the Gu Family Fist is also reasonable.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Gu Qingfeng's words fell, he saw the attribute panel suddenly appear, and the original "Collapse Mountain Fist" was directly changed to "Gu Family Fist".</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng understood.</p><p></p><p>The name of a martial art is not set in stone, and he had just made the change himself.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>To change, it's just a matter of a single thought.</p><p></p><p>Just by saying it.</p><p></p><p>A name is ultimately just a name, changing a name won't make the martial arts any more powerful.</p><p></p><p>In the time that followed,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng silently cultivated, taking Blood Refining Elixirs to advance his cultivation, while occasionally guiding Gu Yang and some of the Gu family guards in their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After all, these martial artists joined the Gu family not only because they were attracted to the resources the Gu family provided, but also because they wanted to learn some advanced martial arts techniques from the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was not at all stingy.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>When it came to the more profound martial arts like the Breakthrough Martial Arts, which involved the Blood Refining Realm, Gu Qingfeng would not rashly pass them on.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts related to breaking through the Blood Refining Realm would certainly be passed down, but not now. Gu Qingfeng would only consider passing them down when his own strength had advanced further.</p><p></p><p>This way,</p><p></p><p>Even if there were any problems, he could directly suppress them with his own power.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Refining Elixir is truly the elixir that Blood Refining Realm martial artists take, a single elixir can save me months of arduous cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng refined another Blood Refining Elixir, feeling the surging power of his blood and qi, his smile becoming more and more apparent.</p><p></p><p>With the Blood Refining Elixir,</p><p></p><p>His breakthrough to the mid-stage of the Blood Refining Realm would be much easier.</p><p></p><p>It's just a pity that this kind of elixir, trying to obtain it through ordinary means, is simply impossible.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, Gu Qingfeng had also purchased some elixirs used by Blood Refining Realm martial artists from the outside, but unfortunately, the effects of those elixirs were not even one percent of the Blood Refining Elixir.</p><p></p><p>More importantly,</p><p></p><p>Those elixirs came with elixir toxins, and taking too many would affect one's foundation.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng only took them once and never took those elixirs again.</p><p></p><p>Until this time when Gu Yang broke through, and there were Blood Refining Elixirs as a reward, did Gu Qingfeng start using elixirs to assist his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye,</p><p></p><p>A month had passed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng consumed all the Blood Refining Elixirs, and his cultivation naturally broke through to the mid-stage of the Blood Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>With the boundary breakthrough,</p><p></p><p>His strength had risen to a new level.</p><p></p><p>The only regret was that upon breaking through to the mid-stage of the Blood Refining Realm, there was no significant increase in his lifespan.</p><p></p><p>From this, it can be seen that only when breaking through to a higher realm would the martial artist's corresponding lifespan increase.</p><p></p><p>On this day,</p><p></p><p>A Gu family guard arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Your subordinate pays respects to the family lord!"</p><p></p><p>"You're here, has something happened?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the person in front of him and said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was a guard captain of the Gu family, named Meng Peng, who was a martial artist at the peak of the Skin Refining Realm. Before joining the Gu family, he was also a rather famous wanderer in the White Stone Dao world.</p><p></p><p>Later, when the Gu family was established, he joined the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>And because of his decent strength, Gu Qingfeng had promoted him to be the guard captain, to command the other guards.</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng respectfully said, "Your subordinate has received news that the Cloud Tower will hold an auction in three days, and it is said that there may be a mid-grade martial art appearing there!"</p><p></p><p>"A mid-grade martial art!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He had always had the Gu family guards investigate the whereabouts of mid-grade martial arts, and unexpectedly, there was a result now.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have any clear information about the origin of this martial art?"</p><p></p><p>"The Cloud Tower is very secretive about these matters, and the information about the mid-grade martial art they have deliberately spread is all they are willing to disclose, the rest of the details are unknown."</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Qingfeng fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 152</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>These were ten Grandmaster Ascension Elixirs.</p><p></p><p>Among them:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng gave two Grandmaster Ascension Elixirs to Gu Peng and Xu Yulan.</p><p></p><p>For the former, it was to enhance his own strength, as his power needed to be elevated.</p><p></p><p>After all, as Gu Qingfeng's strength continued to grow, the realms he could involve himself in became higher. Merely refining the Dao Perfection realm would no longer be enough.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Yulan, there's no need to say more.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng had been secluded in the Whetstone Hall these past few years, his feelings for her were quite complex.</p><p></p><p>Allowing her to advance to the Grandmaster realm, not only would it increase her lifespan, but also grant her a boost in strength.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Peng saw the Grandmaster Ascension Elixirs, he was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He had previously consumed the Breakthrough Elixir and Ascension Elixir, experiencing their profound mysteries.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, Gu Peng had never imagined that there would be an even more extraordinary elixir in the world.</p><p></p><p>A single elixir could allow one to directly break through the Grandmaster Perfection realm.</p><p></p><p>This was something Gu Peng had never conceived of before.</p><p></p><p>After all, Grandmasters were rare in the world, and the powerful experts who could enter this realm were as scarce as phoenix feathers and qilin horns.</p><p></p><p>But now, a single elixir could directly propel one into the Grandmaster realm, revealing the terrifying nature of such an elixir.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the Grandmaster realm, Gu Peng's reverence for Gu Qingfeng only grew.</p><p></p><p>In the secret chamber of the Tianyang Sword Sect, an extremely sinister force was emanating, causing the blood-colored aura to surge in the sky, instilling a sense of unease in all the sect members.</p><p></p><p>This eerie power seemed to linger for a long time before gradually dissipating.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, the door to the secret chamber opened, and the Sect Master of Tianyang emerged.</p><p></p><p>However, the Sect Master now wore a blood-colored robe, and an uncanny, icy aura permeated his brow, his eyes alternating between blood-red and normal.</p><p></p><p>The disciple standing guard outside the chamber had not even had a chance to speak when the blood-colored long hair pierced through his body, turning him into a dried corpse in just a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>When the sect elders arrived upon hearing the news, they were taken aback by this sight.</p><p></p><p>"Greet the Sect Master!" Gong Lei bowed his head as he faced the Sect Master's blood-red eyes, feeling a chill run down his spine.</p><p></p><p>Gong Lei could clearly see that the Sect Master's current state was vastly different from before his seclusion, as if he had become a completely different person.</p><p></p><p>Was it the awakening of an evil spirit? Or had his power spiraled out of control? Gong Lei did not know.</p><p></p><p>But one thing was certain: if he were to anger the Sect Master, he might very well meet his end here.</p><p></p><p>As for escaping, Gong Lei did not have the courage to even consider it.</p><p></p><p>Although he was a Fusion Realm cultivator, he was no different from an ant before the Sect Master's immense power.</p><p></p><p>After a long pause, Gong Lei finally felt the oppressive gaze disappear, replaced by the Sect Master's icy voice.</p><p></p><p>"Speak, what has happened during my seclusion?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gong Lei hastily replied, "Your Excellency, a few months ago, the Divine Warrior King Pei Jing died, and Elders Jiang Ning, Zuoqiu, and Cui Mingfeng all perished as well."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Sect Master's eyes turned ice-cold, and the sinister, evil aura surrounding him intensified.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The aura of evil seemed to have erupted, causing Gong Lei to feel immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>"Who did this?"</p><p></p><p>"Gu Qingfeng--"</p><p></p><p>Gong Lei suppressed the fear in his heart and spoke with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Sect Master of the Tianyang Sect's eyes flashed with a bloody light that vanished quickly: "Gu Qingfeng, this seat remembers that he was at most a Half-Step Grand Master, yet the three Fusion Spirit Realm Elders, along with Pei Jing who is also a Xiantian Sect Master, and numerous troops under his command, how could he have succeeded?"</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, you do not know, Gu Qingfeng is not a Half-Step Grand Master, but a true Grand Master!"</p><p></p><p>"In the battle of Guangyang Prefecture, Pei Jing led an army of 100,000 to advance towards the Baishi Road, but Gu Qingfeng suddenly appeared and with thunderous might slew the three Elders, then also killed Pei Jing among the myriad troops, before departing leisurely."</p><p></p><p>"Now that Pei Jing is dead, the Gu Family Manor has suppressed the entire Guangyang Prefecture, and the Patriarch of the Gu Family Manor, Gu Yang, commands an army of hundreds of thousands, claiming the title of the King of Guangyang!"</p><p></p><p>Gong Lei did not dare to hesitate, and immediately told everything he knew.</p><p></p><p>This was done out of fear that if he spoke even a moment slower, he would be directly slain on the spot by the enraged Sect Master of the Tianyang Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Master!"</p><p>"King of Guangyang!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that during the time this seat was in seclusion, quite a few events have occurred in the world. But this is good, as this seat originally thought he would need at least a century to break through to Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he has achieved this breakthrough so quickly."</p><p></p><p>"As for Jiang Ning and the others, their deaths are of no consequence. As for Pei Jing, this Tianyang Sword Sect had cultivated him for so many years, but he died in Guangyang Prefecture, which only proves that he was not a true dragon."</p><p></p><p>"Now that a Grand Master has emerged, it is the opportunity for this seat to break through. Once this news spreads, I fear that not a few in the Nine Provinces will have their eyes on Gu Qingfeng."</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Tianyang Sect's eyes turned blood-red, and a sinister, cold smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that things would coincide so perfectly.</p><p></p><p>During this seclusion.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Tianyang Sect discovered that the resurgence of the evil omen was much more severe than he had anticipated, and despite his full efforts to suppress it, he was unable to completely subdue it.</p><p></p><p>At present.</p><p></p><p>The evil omen within the Sect Master of the Tianyang Sect was in a semi-resurgent state, and if he could not make a breakthrough to let the evil omen return to slumber, his own self would be completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>But to achieve a breakthrough, it was easier said than done.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Tianyang Sect had emerged from seclusion this time, intending to gather a large number of living beings to cultivate himself and then break through to the realms above the Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>Hearing that Gu Qingfeng had broken through to Grand Master, he had a different idea.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people could not be compared to a Grand Master, even if there were millions of them, they would not be as useful as devouring a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>At such a level of strength, their flesh and blood have already undergone a complete transformation, and their very life has been elevated.</p><p></p><p>If he could devour one.</p><p></p><p>It would surely pave the way for his own breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Once he broke through the Transformation Realm barrier, he could step into the Divinity Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This seat originally intended to devour a Grand Master after breaking through to the Divinity Realm to consolidate the foundation of his cultivation, but now it seems unnecessary to go through that trouble.</p><p></p><p>As long as he devours Gu Qingfeng, he can directly break into the Divinity Realm.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he will be the sole supreme ruler under heaven and earth!"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Tianyang Sect's gaze turned icy cold, and then his eyes fell back on Gong Lei.</p><p></p><p>"Notify the other disciples of the sect, this seat will personally go to Guangyang Prefecture. A Grand Master is nothing, this seat will let the world know that the Tianyang Sword Sect cannot be provoked by anyone, not even a Grand Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gong Lei's expression brightened, and he immediately took his leave to carry out the order.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 111</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"When did Father cultivate the secret guards, and why did I not receive any news about it beforehand?"</p><p></p><p>"The matter of the secret guards will be told to you when the timing is appropriate."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng casually brushed it off.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang, despite having countless doubts in his heart, could only suppress them.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the Whetstone Hall.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang shook off the gloominess he just had, and his chest was filled with great heroic spirit.</p><p></p><p>A hundred secret guards.</p><p></p><p>Although the number does not seem large, each one of them, when taken out, is a powerful expert capable of establishing their own sect.</p><p></p><p>Having such a force at his disposal, Gu Yang would have a lot of room for maneuvering.</p><p></p><p>â€”</p><p></p><p>In the inner hall.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang summoned all the secret guards.</p><p></p><p>Seeing over a hundred black-clad figures standing there, each with a cold and indifferent expression, making the vast inner hall seem silent and tranquil.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Yang's perception of the secret guards was refreshed once again.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention anything else.</p><p></p><p>Just the level of discipline alone was already evident.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Father also has the ambition to contend for the world?" </p><p></p><p>Gu Yang pondered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could one explain the existence of these secret guards?</p><p></p><p>At first, Gu Yang thought the secret guards were some talented individuals secretly cultivated by Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>But now, it seems that the secret guards cannot be simply described as ordinary talented martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Although there are only a hundred of them, they give Gu Yang a sense of cold and ruthless killing, as if he is facing the elite troops of the military.</p><p></p><p>It is clear that the secret guards are not simple.</p><p></p><p>"What martial arts do the secret guards cultivate?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at Gu Yi and asked.</p><p></p><p>The latter, upon hearing the question, cupped his fists and said, "All the secret guards cultivate the Crimson Flame Divine Skill and the Seven Killing Blade Technique passed down by the Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>"In that case, Father has indeed placed great importance on you all!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang nodded.</p><p></p><p>He was naturally familiar with the Seven Killing Blade Technique, and he had also heard of the Crimson Flame Divine Skill, which was an unparalleled supreme skill with the potential to reach the Xiantian Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>As the Patriarch of the Gu Clan Manor, Gu Yang himself also had the qualification to cultivate the Crimson Flame Divine Skill.</p><p></p><p>However, he was currently practicing the Blood Realm, so he had no intention of cultivating the Crimson Flame Divine Skill.</p><p></p><p>After all, in terms of the Blood Realm, the Scorching Sun Divine Palm could be considered superior, as long as it is cultivated to the ninth level of perfection, it can allow one to break through the Bone Refining Realm on their own.</p><p></p><p>This is something that the Crimson Flame Divine Skill cannot match.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the two have different upper limits.</p><p></p><p>The Scorching Sun Divine Palm's upper limit is in the initial stage of the Bone Refining Realm, while the Crimson Flame Divine Skill's upper limit is in the Xiantian Grandmaster Realm.</p><p></p><p>If we talk about importance, the former is nothing compared to the latter.</p><p></p><p>But for Gu Yang at the moment, the most important thing is to first break through the Bone Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>The post-Blood Realm may not seem weak, but it is only a small patch of land in the White Stone Dao, if it is in other places, the post-Blood Realm would not be enough.</p><p></p><p>The battle with the rebel army has made Gu Yang clearly understand his own shortcomings in strength.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for Gu Qingfeng's timely arrival, he would have already died at the hands of the rebel army.</p><p></p><p>After looking at the secret guards for a moment, Gu Yang temporarily assigned them to the inner hall, then waved his hand to dismiss the crowd, leaving only Gu Yi behind.</p><p></p><p>"Commander Gu, there is something I would like to ask."</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, please go ahead!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at him and said in a deep voice, "When did Father start building the secret guards?"</p><p></p><p>"This is something the Patriarch should ask the Patriarch directly, I dare not speculate!" Gu Yi shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>He shook his head, not answering Gu Yang's question.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang frowned: "My father has ordered you to obey me, so if I ask you something, are you unwilling to answer?"</p><p></p><p>"This matter was first commanded by the lord, it is not that I am unwilling to answer, if the lord truly wants to blame me, I am willing to bear the punishment!"</p><p></p><p>As Gu Yi said this, he knelt down on one knee, bowing his head and speaking.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the other party for a while, Gu Yang sighed helplessly: "Alright, since you are unwilling to say it, I won't force you. Get up and speak."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi got up as instructed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said: "I have a matter that requires your bodyguards to do."</p><p></p><p>"The lord, please speak!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi repeated his previous words.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said: "I need your bodyguards to investigate thoroughly, how is the imperial court's strength in Guangyang Prefecture, and also secretly collect useful people, waiting for the right time!"</p><p></p><p>"I will carry out the order!"</p><p></p><p>"Go then--"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang waved his hand, and finally added a sentence.</p><p></p><p>"The security issue of the Gu Family Manor will also be temporarily taken care of by your bodyguards."</p><p></p><p>"Yes--"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi accepted the order and withdrew.</p><p></p><p>In the originally spacious inner hall, only Gu Yang was left.</p><p></p><p>"The available manpower is still a bit lacking!"</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Gu Yang sighed helplessly.</p><p></p><p>The bodyguards are powerful and can be used by him, but unfortunately, a hundred bodyguards are ultimately too few.</p><p></p><p>After all, if the manpower needs to be dispersed, a hundred people are absolutely not enough.</p><p></p><p>But there's no other way.</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family Manor has only been established for a few years, and it takes time to cultivate a new generation of powerful figures.</p><p></p><p>Any force, without decades or even hundreds of years of accumulation, can't have any impressive foundation.</p><p></p><p>But precisely because of this.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang is still full of doubts about Gu Qingfeng's ability to secretly cultivate the bodyguards.</p><p></p><p>After all, the strength of the bodyguards is not simple.</p><p></p><p>The weakest are at the Refine Bone Perfection realm, and the strongest are at the Refine Organ Perfection realm, such a force is not something that can be cultivated in just a few years.</p><p></p><p>Back then in Linxian, Gu Qingfeng was only a suspected Blood Refining realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>In the battle with the Exorcism Sect's Taoist priest, Gu Yang also saw it with his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>From this, it can be seen that Gu Qingfeng also has secrets.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could he have such unfathomable strength now, and how could he have cultivated such a force of bodyguards.</p><p></p><p>However, even though Gu Yang is clear that Gu Qingfeng has secrets, he will not really try to get to the bottom of it.</p><p></p><p>In his view, if the timing is right, Gu Qingfeng will tell him, otherwise, even if he asks, the other party will not say it.</p><p></p><p>Rather than thinking too much, it's better to make good use of the bodyguards' strength to develop and strengthen his own power.</p><p></p><p>When the day comes that the entire world collapses into chaos, the Gu Family Manor can also carve out a place for itself in this chaotic world.</p><p></p><p>"The Taixuan Emperor is seriously ill, and he is unlikely to last much longer. Once that monarch passes away, the stability of the Taixuan Dynasty will completely dissipate.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the world will be even more chaotic than it is now!"</p><p></p><p>"With the current strength of my Gu Family Manor, the task of dominating the world is still arduous and long!"</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention conquering the world, but at least we must have the strength to resolve the problem of the Evil Buddha on the Nine Turns Path, the Evil Buddha issue unresolved is like a sword hanging over our heads, ready to take our lives at any time!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's gaze was profound, and the more severe the problems facing the Gu Family Manor, the calmer he became in his heart.</p><p></p><p>As long as they proceed step by step.</p><p></p><p>All things are possible.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 111</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"When did Father cultivate the secret guards, and why did I not receive any news about it beforehand?"</p><p></p><p>"The matter of the secret guards will be told to you when the timing is right."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng casually brushed it off.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang, despite having countless doubts in his heart, could only suppress them.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the Whetstone Hall.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's gloominess from earlier was swept away, and his chest was filled with heroic spirit.</p><p></p><p>A hundred secret guards.</p><p></p><p>Although the number may not seem large, each one of them was a powerful expert capable of establishing their own sect.</p><p></p><p>Having such a force at his disposal would give him a great deal of room for maneuvering.</p><p></p><p>-</p><p></p><p>In the inner hall.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang summoned all the secret guards.</p><p></p><p>Seeing over a hundred black-clad figures standing there, each with an indifferent expression, the vast inner hall felt deathly silent.</p><p></p><p>Witnessing this, Gu Yang's perception of the secret guards was refreshed once again.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention anything else.</p><p></p><p>Just the level of discipline they displayed was already quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Father also has ambitions to contend for the world?" </p><p></p><p>Gu Yang pondered.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could one explain the existence of these secret guards?</p><p></p><p>At first, Gu Yang thought the secret guards were some talented individuals secretly cultivated by Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>But now, it seems that the secret guards cannot be described as ordinary talented martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Although there are only a hundred of them, they gave Gu Yang a sense of cold and ruthless killing intent, as if he was facing the elite forces of the military.</p><p></p><p>It is clear that the secret guards are no simple matter.</p><p></p><p>"What martial arts do the secret guards cultivate?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang turned to Gu Yi and asked.</p><p></p><p>The latter, upon hearing the question, cupped his fists and said, "All the secret guards cultivate the Crimson Flame Divine Skill and the Seven Killing Blade Art passed down by the Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>"In that case, Father has indeed placed great importance on you all!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang nodded.</p><p></p><p>He was naturally familiar with the Seven Killing Blade Art, and had also heard of the Crimson Flame Divine Skill, which was an unparalleled supreme skill with the potential to reach the Xiantian Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>As the Patriarch of the Gu Family Manor, Gu Yang himself also had the qualification to cultivate the Crimson Flame Divine Skill.</p><p></p><p>However, he was currently focused on cultivating the Blood Realm, so he had no intention of cultivating the Crimson Flame Divine Skill.</p><p></p><p>After all, in terms of the Blood Realm, the Scorching Sun Divine Palm could be considered superior, as reaching its Ninth Layer of Perfection would allow one to break through to the Bone Refining Realm on their own.</p><p></p><p>This was something the Crimson Flame Divine Skill could not match.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the two skills had different upper limits.</p><p></p><p>The Scorching Sun Divine Palm's upper limit was in the initial stage of the Bone Refining Realm, while the Crimson Flame Divine Skill's upper limit was in the Xiantian Grandmaster Realm.</p><p></p><p>In terms of importance, the former was indeed insignificant compared to the latter.</p><p></p><p>But for now, the most important thing for Gu Yang was to first break through the Bone Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>The post-Blood Realm might not seem weak, but it was only a small plot in the vast White Stone Dao. If he were to be in other places, the post-Blood Realm would not be enough.</p><p></p><p>The battle with the rebel army had made Gu Yang clearly aware of the shortcomings in his strength. If Gu Qingfeng had not arrived in time, he would have been killed by the rebel army.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of observing the secret guards, Gu Yang temporarily assigned them to the inner hall, then waved his hand to dismiss the crowd, leaving only Gu Yi behind.</p><p></p><p>"Commander Gu, there is something I would like to ask."</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, please go ahead!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at him and said in a solemn tone, "When did Father start establishing the secret guards?"</p><p></p><p>"This is a matter that the Patriarch should directly ask the Patriarch about. I dare not speculate on it!" Gu Yi shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He shook his head, not answering Gu Yang's question.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang frowned: "My father has ordered you to obey me, so if I ask you something, are you unwilling to answer?"</p><p></p><p>"This matter was first commanded by the master, it is not that I am unwilling to answer, if the lord really wants to blame me, I am also willing to bear the punishment!"</p><p></p><p>As Gu Yi said this, he knelt down on one knee on the ground and said with his head bowed.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the other party for a while, Gu Yang sighed helplessly: "Alright, since you are unwilling to say it, I won't force you, get up and speak!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi got up as instructed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said: "I have something I need your bodyguards to do."</p><p></p><p>"The lord, please speak!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi repeated the previous words.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said: "I need the bodyguards to investigate thoroughly, how is the strength of the court in Guangyang Prefecture, and also secretly collect useful people, waiting for the right time!"</p><p></p><p>"I will carry out the order!"</p><p></p><p>"Go--"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang waved his hand, and finally added a sentence.</p><p></p><p>"The security issue of the Gu Family Manor will also be temporarily taken care of by your bodyguards."</p><p></p><p>"Yes--"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi accepted the order and withdrew.</p><p></p><p>In the originally spacious inner hall, only Gu Yang was left.</p><p></p><p>"The available manpower is still a bit lacking!"</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Gu Yang sighed helplessly.</p><p></p><p>The bodyguards are powerful and can be used by him, but unfortunately, a hundred bodyguards are ultimately too few.</p><p></p><p>After all, if the manpower is to be dispersed, a hundred people are absolutely not enough.</p><p></p><p>But there's no help for it.</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family Manor has only been established for a few years, and it takes a certain amount of time to cultivate the new generation of powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Any force, without decades or even hundreds of years of accumulation, can't have any impressive foundation.</p><p></p><p>But precisely because of this.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang is still full of doubts about Gu Qingfeng's ability to secretly cultivate the bodyguards.</p><p></p><p>After all.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the bodyguards is not simple. The weakest are at the Refine Bone Perfection, and the strongest are at the Refine Viscera Perfection, such a force is not something that can be cultivated in just a few years.</p><p></p><p>Back then in Linxian, Gu Qingfeng was only a suspected Blood Refining Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>In the battle with the Exorcism Sect Sorcerer, Gu Yang also saw it with his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>From this, it can be seen.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also has secrets.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise.</p><p></p><p>How could he have such unfathomable strength now, and how could he have cultivated such a force of bodyguards.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Even though Gu Yang is clear that Gu Qingfeng has secrets, he will not really try to get to the bottom of it.</p><p></p><p>In his view.</p><p></p><p>If the timing is right, Gu Qingfeng will tell him, otherwise, even if he asks, the other party will not say it.</p><p></p><p>Rather than thinking so much, it's better to make good use of the strength of the bodyguards to develop and strengthen his own power.</p><p></p><p>When the day comes when the world completely collapses into chaos, the Gu Family Manor can also carve out a place for itself in this chaotic world.</p><p></p><p>"The Taixuan Emperor is seriously ill, and he probably won't last much longer, and once that person passes away, the stability of the Taixuan Dynasty will be completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the world will be even more chaotic than it is now!"</p><p></p><p>"With the current strength of my Gu Family Manor, to dominate the world is still a long and arduous task!"</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention vying for the world, but at least we must have the strength to resolve the problem of the Evil Buddha on the Nine Turns Path, the Evil Buddha problem unresolved, is like a sword hanging over our heads, ready to take our lives at any time!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's gaze was deep, and the more severe the problems facing the Gu Family Manor, the calmer he became in his heart.</p><p></p><p>As long as they proceed step by step.</p><p></p><p>Everything is possible.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

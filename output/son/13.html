        <h1>Chapter 13</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It had been two years.</p><p></p><p>Over the past two years, Gu Qingfeng had been quietly managing the Gu family, while also mobilizing the Gu family's strength to collect other martial arts.</p><p></p><p>After all, the breakthroughs in the Collapse Mountain Fist and the Iron Body Technique had made Gu Qingfeng realize that even if he did not make any breakthroughs in his cultivation, as long as he practiced enough martial arts, he could passively enhance his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Each martial art has the effect of tempering different parts of the body.</p><p></p><p>Take the Collapse Mountain Fist, for example. This martial art truly strengthens the fists, while the effects on the skin and flesh are just secondary.</p><p></p><p>As for the Iron Body Technique, it is an overall defensive martial art that can temper the skin, making it as hard as iron.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the more martial arts one collects, the greater the benefits.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary people, with limited innate talent and cultivation, it would be impossible for them to practice multiple martial arts.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng was different. He had the Upgrade Points.</p><p></p><p>As long as he had enough Upgrade Points, he could cultivate all the martial arts to perfection without any problems.</p><p></p><p>However, even among the low-grade martial arts, there were still differences in strength.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not pay attention to the generally weak and inferior low-grade martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Over the past two years, Gu Qingfeng had found three relatively powerful low-grade martial arts:</p><p>The Great Slab Smashing Palm, the Iron Leg Technique, and the Tempered Iron Finger...</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng's martial arts aptitude was not high, since he was a Blood Refining Realm cultivator, he could cultivate the low-grade martial arts much faster than ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>In two years, Gu Qingfeng had cultivated these three martial arts to the initial mastery stage.</p><p></p><p>From the outside, there was nothing special to be seen, but only Gu Qingfeng himself knew that his strength had improved significantly compared to two years ago.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the information panel that had been dormant for a long time suddenly refreshed with a new message:</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has broken through to the post-Skin Refining Realm!"</p><p>"Reward: 5 Upgrade Points!"</p><p>"Reward: 30 Blood Refining Pills!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the information on the panel, Gu Qingfeng's expression immediately brightened.</p><p></p><p>"Good, I didn't expect Yang'er to break through to the post-Skin Refining Realm so quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was only seven years old when he started cultivating martial arts, and in just three years, he had already reached the post-Skin Refining Realm, which was an astonishingly talented aptitude.</p><p></p><p>At least in the White Stone Dao, Gu Qingfeng had never heard of anyone who could reach the post-Skin Refining Realm at this age.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Gu Yang's breakthrough was also due to the fact that Gu Qingfeng had often given him Blood Refining Pills.</p><p></p><p>Regardless, Gu Yang's talent in the martial arts was already considered quite outstanding.</p><p></p><p>Now that Gu Yang had broken through, the 5 Upgrade Points were the first thing Gu Qingfeng wanted to use to continue upgrading the Collapse Mountain Fist.</p><p></p><p>After all, among all the martial arts, the Collapse Mountain Fist had the highest grade.</p><p></p><p>However, when Gu Qingfeng's gaze fell on the Collapse Mountain Fist, he found that the Upgrade Points required for its upgrade had increased from 5 points to 10 points.</p><p></p><p>This change made Gu Qingfeng furrow his brows.</p><p></p><p>"Last time, the Collapse Mountain Fist only required 5 Upgrade Points to upgrade, but now it requires 10 points. It seems that after breaking the limit, the Upgrade Points required for martial arts upgrades have increased significantly!"</p><p></p><p>10 Upgrade Points, which Gu Qingfeng did not have. He had only accumulated 5 Upgrade Points over the past two years.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Gu Qingfeng gave up on upgrading the Collapse Mountain Fist and instead chose to upgrade the Iron Body Technique.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Iron Body Technique...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Resolute Technique was also quite important.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for cultivating the Resolute Technique to perfection, allowing his own defense to be much stronger than ordinary warriors, who knows, he might have already died at the hands of Shangguan Jiang.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Collapse Mountain Fist could not be further upgraded, Gu Qingfeng naturally had to improve the Resolute Technique.</p><p></p><p>As for the other low-grade martial arts, Gu Qingfeng had no intention of wasting his upgrade points on them for the time being.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple.</p><p></p><p>Low-grade martial arts only require time to cultivate, and reaching perfection is not a problem, but if one wants to break through the limits, it's not that simple.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was clear that the reason the Collapse Mountain Fist could break through the limit was that he relied on the Blood Refining Elixir and a fortuitous coincidence.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the Collapse Mountain Fist breaking through the limit would have been basically impossible.</p><p></p><p>This point could be directly seen from the fact that there were many White Stone Dao cultivators who had reached the Refined Skin realm, but the number of Refined Blood realm warriors had dropped sharply.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through the limits of martial arts was not something everyone could achieve.</p><p></p><p>Now, even if he had the Blood Refining Elixir, Gu Qingfeng had no confidence in letting the Resolute Technique break through the limit, so he simply used five upgrade points to break through the limit of the Resolute Technique.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the thought arose, the five upgrade points disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng suddenly felt a surge of memories emerge, in which he had cultivated the Resolute Technique for decades, training in the bitter cold of winter and the scorching heat of summer, relying on the pounding of warriors' fists and the tempering of his body in waterfalls, only after such a long accumulation was he able to successfully break through the limit of the Resolute Technique.</p><p></p><p>And at the moment the Resolute Technique broke through the limit, Gu Qingfeng's entire skin turned a bronze-like color, and his muscles seemed to contain an explosive power.</p><p></p><p>Surging blood qi diffused.</p><p></p><p>It rose into the sky like a blood mist.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, the boiling blood qi calmed down, and Gu Qingfeng looked at his attribute panel again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng Age: 32/100 Realm: Refined Blood Martial Arts: Collapse Mountain Fist (Unbreakable Level 1), Resolute Technique (Iron Body Level 1), Great Slamming Gravestone Hand (Proficient), Iron Leg Technique (Proficient), Refining Iron Finger (Proficient) Upgrade Points: 0...</p><p></p><p>"Iron Body!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the characteristics of the Resolute Technique, clenched his right hand tightly, and grabbed towards his left arm. The power that could easily shatter stones and break gold could not even break through the skin's defense, only leaving a few white marks on it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Gu Qingfeng's expression brightened.</p><p></p><p>After the Resolute Technique broke through the limit, his defensive capability had evolved to a terrifying degree.</p><p></p><p>Since the Collapse Mountain Fist had broken through the limit, and he had subsequently cultivated the Great Slamming Gravestone Hand and Refining Iron Finger, Gu Qingfeng's fingers were comparable to ordinary divine weapons, but even so, they could not break through his own defense.</p><p></p><p>From this, it could be seen that his current physical defense strength was such that ordinary Refined Blood realm warriors probably had no chance of breaking through it.</p><p></p><p>Only Refined Blood mid-realm warriors would be able to pose some threat to him.</p><p></p><p>As for his overall combat power, Gu Qingfeng did not yet know what level he had reached.</p><p></p><p>After all, combat power was something that needed to be tested in real battles.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Yang had walked in from outside.</p><p></p><p>"Son greets father!"</p><p></p><p>Compared to two years ago, Gu Yang's figure was now even more upright, indistinguishable from a teenager, and due to his long-term martial arts practice, he also had a strong, vigorous aura.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled slightly, "Yang'er has come."</p><p></p><p>"Father, I just broke through to the post-Refined Skin realm!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's face was full of joy, and he couldn't wait to come and report the good news after his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded approvingly, "Excellent, to be able to break through to the post-Refined Skin realm at such a young age, your future accomplishments will surely surpass your father's, and the future of the Gu family will depend on you to support it!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

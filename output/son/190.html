        <h1>Chapter 190</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang took a glance at Gu Yun, then turned to look at Gu Yi beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Commander Gu, immediately lead the elite guards to the Pei family residence. Remember, our order is to exterminate the entire Pei family, not leaving a single one alive!"</p><p></p><p>"I will obey the order, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi cupped his fist and accepted the command.</p><p></p><p>As for whether the elite guards could eliminate the Pei family, Gu Yang was not too worried.</p><p></p><p>After all, the strength of the elite guards was not weak, with eleven Xiantian Sect Masters, which was sufficient to deal with most troubles.</p><p></p><p>It is true that the Pei family had deep foundations, but with the demise of Pei Jing, the Pei family's strength had been greatly diminished, and how many powerful experts could they still produce within the clan? In Gu Yang's view, the current Pei family could at most field three to five Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, with the strength of the elite guards, eliminating the Pei family would be more than enough.</p><p></p><p>As for the Shenwu Sect, that was the main force Gu Yang intended to use against the Tianyang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the Pei family, the Tianyang Sword Sect was the one with truly formidable foundations.</p><p></p><p>As an immortal sect, no one knew how many powerful experts they had guarding them, and even if the elite guards managed to obtain intelligence about the Tianyang Sword Sect, in Gu Yang's view, it was impossible for the information to be complete.</p><p></p><p>After all, the intelligence of an immortal sect was not something easily obtained.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Yang looked at the other commanders.</p><p></p><p>"What you all need to do is to promptly dispatch troops to provide support when the Pei family and the Tianyang Sword Sect are destroyed. In this battle, I will lead a small force to personally eliminate these two families. Once the news leaks out, other powers might also make a move. Prevent the situation of being surrounded by a large army. You all need to be fully prepared. Once the news arrives, act immediately!"</p><p></p><p>"We understand, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>The group of commanders all had solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Yang waved his hand, letting these people leave to make preparations.</p><p></p><p>When the others had left, Gu Yang looked at Gu Yun and spoke, "Half a day ago, the elite guards also received news that there were abnormal phenomena occurring in the Tianyang Sword Sect, with evil apparitions obscuring the sky. Sect Master Gu, do you know the reason for this?"</p><p></p><p>"Evil apparitions?" Gu Yun's expression changed upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"Evil apparitions, the birth of all things, this is a celestial phenomenon that only occurs when a powerful expert has reached the Hua Sheng realm. If what you say is true, it seems the Tianyang Sword Sect now has an expert who has reached the Hua Sheng realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, if there is truly a Hua Sheng realm expert, this battle will be quite difficult. Even with the strength of our Shenwu Sect, it would be hard to deal with a Hua Sheng realm expert!"</p><p></p><p>This was not Gu Yun's self-deprecation, but simply the reality of the situation.</p><p></p><p>If it were on the Shenwu Sect's home turf, then with the sect's resources, Gu Yun would still have a chance of dealing with a Hua Sheng realm expert.</p><p></p><p>But now, to go to the Tianyang Sword Sect's domain and face a Hua Sheng realm expert, that would be as difficult as ascending to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The Hua Sheng realm experts were equivalent to great sect masters in the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Such existences were far beyond the reach of ordinary sect masters. Even true meaning sect masters would be nothing more than tiny ants before them, easily crushed if they so wished.</p><p></p><p>"If we are to deal with such a powerful expert, we must request the assistance of Master Gu!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun expressed his opinion. Currently, only Gu Qingfeng would be able to handle a Hua Sheng realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang shook his head, "Father is occupied with dealing with the evil apparitions in Blood Mountain, how can he spare the time to handle the Tianyang Sword Sect? While Hua Sheng realm experts are indeed formidable, I have the Zhu Xie Dao in my possession, so I may not necessarily be unable to deal with them."</p><p></p><p>"The Zhu Xie Dao..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yun couldn't help but glance at the long sword Gu Yang always carried on his back.</p><p></p><p>As for whether the Zhu Xie Dao could...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The ancients were not completely certain about the strength of those who had reached the Hua Sheng realm. </p><p></p><p>Before witnessing the awe-inspiring power of the Zhu Xie Dao (Purge Evil Sword), he would have absolutely refused to believe that a divine weapon could possess the ability to contend with those at the Hua Sheng realm.</p><p></p><p>But... when he saw Nangong Yu being slain on the spot by the Zhu Xie Dao, Gu Yun no longer underestimated the might of this divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Yun could not refute Gu Yang's words. </p><p></p><p>Such an unparalleled divine weapon cannot be judged by ordinary standards.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>As Gu Yang and the others set out, Gu Qingfeng had already entered the Nanyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>At his current realm, he had gradually transcended the mundane and reached a state beyond the mortal. </p><p></p><p>For an ordinary person to leave Taishan Prefecture and enter Nanyang Prefecture, even riding the fastest horse, it would take them ten days to half a month to accomplish.</p><p></p><p>But for Gu Qingfeng, it only took him less than two days to enter Nanyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered Nanyang Prefecture, Gu Qingfeng sensed a chilling and eerie aura of evil permeating the air.</p><p></p><p>This aura was so subtle that even Grandmasters would find it difficult to detect. </p><p></p><p>But to Gu Qingfeng's eyes, this aura was unmistakable.</p><p></p><p>"Could this be the evil entity from Blood Mountain Prefecture?" Gu Qingfeng pondered.</p><p></p><p>If it was indeed the evil entity from Blood Mountain Prefecture, then its strength was no simple matter. </p><p></p><p>After all, this was not within the borders of Blood Mountain Prefecture, yet the evil aura from that entity had spread this far, indicating its power was truly formidable.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that this was an existence on par with an Evil Buddha.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Gu Qingfeng could determine that this evil entity was not far from breaking its seal and emerging into the world.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the evil aura would not be so potent, able to be sensed even across different prefectures.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Gu Qingfeng headed towards Blood Mountain Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>With each step, he left afterimages in his wake, causing those who witnessed it to rub their eyes, thinking they were hallucinating.</p><p></p><p>"A divine... a divine being!" </p><p></p><p>"I have seen a divine being!!"</p><p></p><p>Some commoners knelt on the ground, kowtowing towards the direction Gu Qingfeng had departed, while others stood rooted to the spot, trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Not only the common folk, even some martial artists were left dumbfounded, as if they had truly encountered a divine being.</p><p></p><p>After all, among all the martial artists in the world, even the most exceptional in lightness skill could not achieve such a feat - leaving afterimages, appearing as if a true immortal.</p><p></p><p>This was an astounding technique that left them in awe, believing they had witnessed a divine manifestation.</p><p></p><p>As for these matters, Gu Qingfeng merely smiled without much concern.</p><p></p><p>Whether they were divine beings or spiritual entities, in his eyes, they were merely individuals who had mastered greater powers. </p><p></p><p>While he might hold them in awe for their formidable abilities, he would never seek their blessings or worship them.</p><p></p><p>His "awe" was solely directed towards their powerful cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After some time, Gu Qingfeng entered Blood Mountain Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The moment he stepped into Blood Mountain Prefecture, the evil aura that had been lingering in the air suddenly surged, multiplying several times, causing the temperature to plummet dramatically.

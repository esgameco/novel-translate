        <h1>Chapter 174</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His massive body.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it dissipated into flying ashes.</p><p></p><p>With the demise of the Evil Buddha, the eerie and icy aura that had been circling the Nine Curves Path now seemed to be dispersing like rootless duckweed.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng paid no attention to these things.</p><p></p><p>His gaze.</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, it was fixed on the direction where the Evil Buddha had perished.</p><p></p><p>Only to see, at the place where the Evil Buddha had once been, a drop of golden, turbid blood suddenly appeared there.</p><p></p><p>"Blood!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>One must know that when an evil entity is slain, it would only leave behind black ashes, just like a mysterious death.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>This time, the demise of the Evil Buddha left behind a drop of blood, causing Gu Qingfeng to instinctively feel that this blood was no ordinary thing.</p><p></p><p>Immediately.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng approached the drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>The golden, turbid blood was filled with a sinister and evil aura. When Gu Qingfeng's thoughts fell upon the blood, a terrifying pressure suddenly engulfed him.</p><p></p><p>In the Nine Heavens above.</p><p>The Buddha plucked a flower.</p><p>But the Buddha's body was mutilated, its eyes gouged out, with only tears of blood flowing.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng's eyes met those of the Buddha, a towering divine might swept across the heavens and earth, and an indescribable great terror surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In the next breath.</p><p>The scene shattered.</p><p>The so-called Buddha of the Nine Heavens was like a dream, a mere illusion.</p><p>Only the blood before him emanated a strange fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>"This is the origin of the Evil Buddha!"</p><p>"A single drop of blood gave rise to a supremely powerful evil entity!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's heart trembled.</p><p>He had always been curious about how evil entities came into being.</p><p>Just as the appearance of the mysterious was due to the accumulated resentment of living beings from years of natural disasters.</p><p>But regarding evil entities, Gu Qingfeng had not had much clue.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>Gu Qingfeng saw this drop of blood, and he understood the origin of the Evil Buddha of the Nine Curves Path.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p>When slaying other evil entities, Gu Qingfeng had never seen such blood appear.</p><p>Pondering this, Gu Qingfeng's gaze returned to the blood, his eyes filled with trepidation.</p><p>A single drop of blood could give rise to an evil entity more terrifying than the Patriarch of an immortal sect.</p><p>If this drop of blood truly belonged to its master, how powerful must that existence be?</p><p>That kind of being.</p><p>Might be able to effortlessly destroy him with just a finger.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the towering divine might of the Buddha in the Nine Heavens, Gu Qingfeng's heart grew increasingly grave.</p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked up at the sky, as if there was a Buddha seated in the Nine Heavens, gazing down upon him.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting!"</p><p>"This world is indeed not as simple as it seems!"</p><p>"The Evil Buddha of the Nine Curves Path... the master of this drop of blood... but no matter what secrets this world holds, they are of no importance to me. Before absolute strength, any obstacle is but an illusion!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured to himself.</p><p>Although the Buddha in the Nine Heavens gave him a powerful impression, far beyond his current ability to resist, even if he used the two great celestial veins, he would still be no match for that Buddha.</p><p>But.</p><p>He is not that Buddha's match now.</p><p>However, if given time to grow stronger, that may no longer be the case.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore -</p><p>Gu Qingfeng was also curious about what kind of existence could have severed that Buddha's arm and gouged out its eyes.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A haze of confusion descended upon Gu Qingfeng's mind, but it did not shake his resolve much.</p><p></p><p>It didn't matter what the reasons were.</p><p></p><p>As long as his own strength was sufficient, all problems would not be problems.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the blood before him, Gu Qingfeng took out a jade bottle containing medicinal pills from his item storage and poured the blood into it.</p><p></p><p>The entire process was as smooth and effortless as water flowing into a channel.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had thought the process of collecting the blood would encounter some major obstacles, but now it seemed he had overcomplicated things in his own mind.</p><p></p><p>The jade bottle absorbed the blood, and Gu Qingfeng temporarily stored it on his person instead of putting it back into his item storage.</p><p></p><p>There was no other choice.</p><p></p><p>Non-reward items could not be stored in the item storage.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, this drop of blood no longer fell within the scope of the item storage.</p><p></p><p>As for why Gu Qingfeng took this drop of blood, he had his own considerations.</p><p></p><p>This blood had an extraordinary origin, and if he could study it slowly, he might be able to discover something.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, since this drop of blood was able to give rise to the existence of the Evil Buddha, if it were to be left here, it might one day give birth to another evil entity.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Qingfeng naturally would not leave behind this hidden danger.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had slain the Evil Buddha, he could not deny the latter's immense power. After devouring the entire Nine Bend Path, the Evil Buddha's strength had already surpassed that of the ancient Gu Yetian, and it was likely not much weaker than the legendary Penetrate Divinity Realm.</p><p></p><p>If the Evil Buddha were to break out of the Nine Bend Path and continue to devour other living beings, completing its final transformation, even with Gu Qingfeng's possession of two great celestial veins, his current strength might not be enough to subdue it.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Qingfeng had never underestimated the Evil Buddha.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng stepped out of the ancient city, Gu Peng was already waiting outside.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Patriarch!" Gu Peng looked at the person before him with great reverence.</p><p></p><p>He had witnessed the awe-inspiring and terrifying power Gu Qingfeng had displayed in his battle with the Evil Buddha. Even the slightest leakage of such power was enough to overwhelm him.</p><p></p><p>In the face of such a powerful expert, Gu Peng, a Primal Master, was no different from an ant.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng had already heard the rumors that Gu Qingfeng had slain the Sect Master of the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect, Gu Yetian, with a single stroke, but witnessing it with his own eyes was far more impactful than mere hearsay.</p><p></p><p>For Gu Peng, being able to witness this battle in his lifetime was the greatest honor.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go. The problem with the Evil Buddha has been resolved, but the lingering evil energy in this place will take some time to completely dissipate, even though the Evil Buddha itself has been slain," Gu Qingfeng said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The Evil Buddha had been killed, and the remaining evil energy in this place was like rootless duckweed, a matter of time before it dispersed.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if Gu Qingfeng wished, he could expend his own power to accelerate the dispersion of this evil energy.</p><p></p><p>But there was no need.</p><p></p><p>It would dissipate eventually, whether sooner or later, and it made no significant difference.</p><p></p><p>Once the evil aura in this place had completely dissipated, some of the displaced residents could be relocated here, and the Nine Bend Path could then regain its former prosperity.</p><p></p><p>But these matters were not for Gu Qingfeng to handle. Restoring order in the Nine Bend Path was Gu Yang's responsibility; Gu Qingfeng's task was simply to eliminate the lingering evil here.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, when the commotion in the Nine Bend Path had subsided, someone finally mustered the courage to enter the area.</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long before the news of the Evil Buddha's demise spread like a raging hurricane.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

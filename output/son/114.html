        <h1>Chapter 114</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At Gu Qingfeng's command, Gu Peng and the others immediately rushed towards the Divine Fist Sect.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng's aura was surging, his presence as terrifying as an abyss. When he struck out with a punch, it directly caused the body of a Refining Blood Realm cultivator from the Divine Fist Sect to explode.</p><p></p><p>"Audacious!" </p><p></p><p>Zhong Yang stepped forward, his right fist falling with the force to shatter the heavens towards Gu Peng.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, this Gu Peng was not worth mentioning at all. The true strong one in the Gu Family Manor was only Gu Qingfeng. The rest were not renowned in the jianghu and their strength was not that formidable.</p><p></p><p>Since the demise of Sect Master Qi, the Divine Fist Sect had been fully focused on gathering intelligence about the Gu Family Manor. So they believed they understood the strength of the Gu Family Manor quite well.</p><p></p><p>From the information they had gathered, Gu Peng was just a minor outer hall master of the Gu Family, a small Refining Blood Realm cultivator. Even though Gu Peng had just destroyed a Refining Blood Realm cultivator with a single punch, his strength did not seem as simple as the rumors, but Zhong Yang still did not take him seriously.</p><p></p><p>The punch struck out, shocking the heavens and earth! </p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhong Yang's incoming destructive punch, a ferocious smile appeared on Gu Peng's face as he also struck out with his right fist.</p><p></p><p>The two fists collided.</p><p></p><p>The smile that had just appeared on Zhong Yang's face instantly turned to horror.</p><p></p><p>"No—"</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, his arm suddenly exploded, flesh and bone scattered. The lingering force flung his body away like withered grass.</p><p></p><p>After falling to the ground, Zhong Yang coughed up mouthfuls of blood, his eyes filled with terror as he looked at Gu Peng.</p><p></p><p>"No... impossible, your strength... strength..."</p><p></p><p>Unable to finish his words, Zhong Yang's pupils dilated as he died, his face full of unwillingness.</p><p></p><p>This scene left the Divine Fist Sect members utterly horrified. Zhong Yang, the deputy sect master, was the strongest on the surface of the Divine Fist Sect after the death of Sect Master Qi. Yet he was killed by Gu Peng with a single punch. How could they not be shocked?</p><p></p><p>After all, the renowned "Overlord Saber" Gu Qingfeng had not even truly acted yet, and just his subordinate had the strength to instantly kill Zhong Yang. The impact of this scene was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"The Manor Master has ordered, not a single one of the Divine Fist Sect shall be spared!" Gu Peng roared, his face filled with a murderous intent and the excitement of his power's transformation.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Peng had struck down many bandits and thieves on the way from Guangyang Prefecture, the problem was that they were insignificant. Not to mention Refining Bone Realm, even Refining Blood Realm cultivators were few and far between.</p><p></p><p>So this battle with the Divine Fist Sect was the first time Gu Peng truly revealed his perfected Refining Filth Fifth Realm strength. </p><p></p><p>Destroying the Refining Bone Realm's Zhong Yang with a single punch filled Gu Peng's heart with excitement. This was the power he had yearned for! Those formidable figures he had previously found difficult to face could now be directly slain by him.</p><p></p><p>As the words left his mouth, Gu Peng charged into the Divine Fist Sect members like a fierce tiger descending the mountain, the power of the Refining Filth Fifth Realm fully erupting. Every punch he struck took a life.</p><p></p><p>The fist techniques he used were precisely the Gu Family Fist. But now, supported by Gu Peng's powerful cultivation, the seemingly ordinary Gu Family Fist had reached the point of transforming the rotten into the divine.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Divine Fist Sect disciples were terrified by the slaughter.</p><p></p><p>Many outer hall disciples could not help but look at their sect master massacring everything with reverence in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the scene of the Divine Fist Sect's collapse, Gu Qingfeng's expression remained calm. With Gu Peng's strength, suppressing the entire Divine Fist Sect was...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Easily subduing the various sects of Divine Fist was nothing difficult for him.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, </p><p></p><p>he had no intention of taking action.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the ordinary disciples of these Divine Fist sects were not even qualified to make him act.</p><p></p><p>Even the deceased Zhong Yang was the same.</p><p></p><p>Refining Bone Realm! Mere insects—</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng then looked towards the mountain gate of the Divine Fist Sect, his gaze becoming profound.</p><p></p><p>"Come, let me see the true essence of the Divine Fist Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Let me see if the Sect Masters of the past have truly attained enlightenment!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the possibility of the Divine Fist Sect having a Sect Master, Gu Qingfeng's heart was filled with battle intent, as clashing with a strong opponent was a kind of enjoyment for him.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>in recent years,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had few opportunities to take action.</p><p></p><p>Like slaying the weak, he had no interest in that, and the Demonic Buddha of the Nine Twists Path was too powerful, so finding a worthy opponent was not that easy.</p><p></p><p>Now,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng hoped that the Divine Fist Sect truly had a Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>This way,</p><p></p><p>he could truly witness the true power of a so-called Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>As time passed,</p><p></p><p>the Divine Fist Sect had completely collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Many Sect Elders were killed by Gu Peng, and there were even those who directly gave up on resistance and wanted to surrender, but Gu Peng showed no mercy, whether they resisted or surrendered, he slaughtered them all.</p><p></p><p>The reason he did this was because Gu Qingfeng did not speak up.</p><p></p><p>If the other party did not speak up,</p><p></p><p>then the meaning was very clear.</p><p></p><p>Not a single survivor from the Divine Fist Sect!</p><p></p><p>Having followed Gu Qingfeng for many years, Gu Peng naturally understood his personality well, which was that if he did not act, then so be it, but once he acted, he would eradicate the root, leaving no hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng did not show any mercy.</p><p></p><p>From the moment Jie Zong attacked and killed Gu Yang, the fate of the Divine Fist Sect was already sealed.</p><p></p><p>Exterminate the Divine Fist Sect! Not a single one left!—</p><p></p><p>Soon,</p><p></p><p>the vast Divine Fist Sect became a river of blood.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet at the mountain gate was dyed with fresh blood, and severed limbs and dismembered arms could be seen everywhere, the scene was utterly horrific.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>the Demon-Slaying Saber on Gu Qingfeng's back trembled slightly, his expression changed, and a hint of battle intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"He's here!"</p><p></p><p>As if to confirm Gu Qingfeng's words.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a terrifying aura swept through the air, causing many outer disciples to turn pale with fear, their bodies trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Even Gu Peng's face could not help but show a look of shock.</p><p></p><p>Under this aura, he felt as if he was being targeted by a terrifying existence, having the illusion that he could perish at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Retreat back!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng spoke slowly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng and the others did not hesitate, directly retreating to stand beside Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>At this time,</p><p></p><p>within the Divine Fist Sect,</p><p></p><p>a middle-aged warrior slowly descended from the mountain, bald and barefoot, his expression serene, like an enlightened monk, but in Gu Qingfeng's eyes, the seemingly peaceful countenance of the man concealed a demonic presence.</p><p></p><p>With the man's appearance, even under the bright daylight, an indescribable chill could be felt.</p><p></p><p>"You must be the Sect Master of the Divine Fist Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stepped forward, his gaze towards the middle-aged monk filled with battle intent.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>the man stopped.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, a hint of blood-red seemed to surge, and a gentle yet eerie smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"I am the Godless Dao!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

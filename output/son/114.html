            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At Gu Qingfeng's command, </p><p></p><p>Gu Peng and the others immediately rushed towards the Divine Fist Sect.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng's aura was surging, his presence as terrifying as an abyss. When he struck out with a punch, it directly blasted a Divine Fist Sect's Refining Blood Realm cultivator's body into pieces.</p><p></p><p>"Audacious!" </p><p></p><p>Zhong Yang erupted in fury, stepping out with his right fist striking down with the force to shatter the heavens, intending to suppress Gu Peng.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, </p><p></p><p>this Gu Peng was utterly insignificant. </p><p></p><p>The true powerhouse of the Gu Clan Manor was only Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>The rest had little reputation in the jianghu and their strength was not that formidable.</p><p></p><p>Since the demise of Seasonal Sect, </p><p></p><p>the Divine Fist Sect had been fully focused on gathering intelligence about the Gu Clan Manor.</p><p></p><p>So, </p><p></p><p>they believed they had a good understanding of the Gu Clan Manor's strength.</p><p></p><p>From the information gathered, Gu Peng was merely the outer hall master of the Gu Clan, just a minor Refining Blood Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Even though Gu Peng had just destroyed a Refining Blood Realm cultivator with a single punch, suggesting his strength was not as simple as the rumors, Zhong Yang still did not take him seriously.</p><p></p><p>He struck out with a thunderous punch!</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhong Yang's incoming destructive punch, Gu Peng's face twisted into a ferocious smile as he also struck out with his right fist.</p><p></p><p>The two fists collided.</p><p></p><p>The smile on Zhong Yang's face instantly turned to horror.</p><p></p><p>"No—"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't even finish his words before his arm suddenly exploded, flesh and bones flying everywhere. The residual force flung his body away like withered grass.</p><p></p><p>Upon landing, </p><p></p><p>Zhong Yang coughed up mouthfuls of blood, his eyes filled with dread as he looked at Gu Peng.</p><p></p><p>"No... impossible, your strength... strength..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, Zhong Yang's pupils dilated, and he died with an expression of utter resentment.</p><p></p><p>This scene </p><p></p><p>left the Divine Fist Sect members utterly terrified.</p><p></p><p>Since the fall of Seasonal Sect, Zhong Yang, the deputy sect master, was the strongest of the Divine Fist Sect.</p><p></p><p>Yet, </p><p></p><p>this top expert was killed by Gu Peng with a single punch, how could they not be shocked?</p><p></p><p>After all, </p><p></p><p>the renowned "Overlord Saber" Gu Qingfeng had not even truly intervened, and just his subordinate had the power to instantly slay Zhong Yang - the implications of this were staggering.</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch has ordered, not a single one of the Divine Fist Sect shall be spared!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Peng roared, his face filled with the excitement of slaughter and the thrill of his surging power.</p><p></p><p>Although on the way from Guangyang Prefecture, Gu Peng had already killed many bandits and thieves, the problem was that they were insignificant.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention Refining Bone Realm, </p><p></p><p>even Refining Blood Realm cultivators were few and far between.</p><p></p><p>So, </p><p></p><p>this battle with the Divine Fist Sect was the first time Gu Peng truly unleashed his perfected Refining Filth Fifth Realm strength.</p><p></p><p>One-punching the Refining Bone Realm expert Zhong Yang filled Gu Peng's heart with excitement. </p><p></p><p>This was the power he had yearned for! Those formidable figures he could barely look at before, he could now directly slay.</p><p></p><p>The moment the words left his mouth, Gu Peng charged into the Divine Fist Sect's group like a ferocious tiger, the power of the Refining Filth Fifth Realm erupting perfectly, each punch he struck taking a life.</p><p></p><p>The fist techniques he used were the Gu Clan's own.</p><p></p><p>But, </p><p></p><p>the seemingly ordinary Gu Clan fists, now supported by Gu Peng's mighty cultivation, had reached the point of transforming the rotten into the divine.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, </p><p></p><p>the Divine Fist Sect disciples were terrified by the slaughter.</p><p></p><p>Many outer sect disciples watching their own hall master wreaking havoc could not help but look at him with reverence.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the collapse of the Divine Fist Sect before him, Gu Qingfeng's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Peng's strength, suppressing the entire</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Easily conquering the Divine Fist Sect was nothing difficult for him.</p><p></p><p>So, </p><p></p><p>he had no intention of taking action.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the ordinary disciples of the Divine Fist Sect were not worthy of him taking action.</p><p></p><p>Even the deceased Zhong Yang was the same.</p><p></p><p>Refining Bone Realm! Mere insects—</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng then looked towards the gate of the Divine Fist Sect, his gaze becoming profound.</p><p></p><p>"Come, let me see the true essence of the Divine Fist Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Let me see if the Sect Master of the past has truly attained enlightenment!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the possibility of the Divine Fist Sect having a Sect Master, Gu Qingfeng's heart was filled with a fighting spirit, as clashing with a strong opponent was a kind of enjoyment for him.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>in these past years,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not have many opportunities to take action.</p><p></p><p>Like slaying the weak, he had no interest in that, and the Demonic Buddha of the Nine Twists Path was too powerful, so finding a worthy opponent was not that easy.</p><p></p><p>Now,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng hoped that the Divine Fist Sect truly had a Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>This way,</p><p></p><p>he could truly witness the true power of a Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>As time passed,</p><p></p><p>the Divine Fist Sect had completely collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Many Sect Elders were killed by Gu Peng, and there were even those who directly gave up on resistance and wanted to surrender, but Gu Peng showed no mercy, whether they resisted or surrendered, he slaughtered them all.</p><p></p><p>The reason he did this was because Gu Qingfeng did not give the order.</p><p></p><p>If the opponent did not speak up,</p><p></p><p>then the meaning was very clear.</p><p></p><p>Not a single survivor from the Divine Fist Sect!</p><p></p><p>Having followed Gu Qingfeng for many years, Gu Peng naturally understood his personality well - if he did not take action, then so be it, but once he did, he would eradicate the root of the problem without leaving any hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng did not show any mercy.</p><p></p><p>From the moment Jie Zong attacked and killed Gu Yang, the fate of the Divine Fist Sect was already sealed.</p><p></p><p>Exterminate the Divine Fist Sect! Not a single one left!—</p><p></p><p>Soon,</p><p></p><p>the vast Divine Fist Sect became a river of blood.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet at the gate was dyed with fresh blood, and severed limbs and dismembered bodies could be seen everywhere, the scene was utterly horrific.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>the Demon-Slaying Saber on Gu Qingfeng's back trembled slightly, his expression changed, and a fighting spirit seemed to flare up in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"He's here!"</p><p></p><p>As if to confirm Gu Qingfeng's words.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a terrifying aura swept through the air, causing the many outer disciples to turn deathly pale, their bodies trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Even Gu Peng's face could not help but reveal a look of shock.</p><p></p><p>Under this aura, he felt as if he was being targeted by a terrifying existence, having the illusion that he could be killed at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Retreat back!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng spoke slowly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng and the others did not hesitate, directly retreating to stand behind Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>At this time,</p><p></p><p>within the Divine Fist Sect,</p><p></p><p>a middle-aged warrior slowly descended from the mountain, bald and barefoot, his expression serene, like an enlightened monk, but in Gu Qingfeng's eyes, the seemingly peaceful countenance of the man concealed a demonic presence.</p><p></p><p>With the man's appearance, even under the bright daylight, an indescribable chill could be felt.</p><p></p><p>"You must be the Sect Master of the Divine Fist Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stepped forward, his gaze towards the middle-aged monk filled with fighting intent.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>the man stopped.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, a hint of blood-red seemed to surge, and a gentle yet eerie smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"I am the Saintly Void Dao!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 82</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps—"</p><p></p><p>"I should refine the martial arts of various schools and create my own truly perfect martial art!"</p><p></p><p>A divine light suddenly flashed in Gu Qingfeng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Throughout history, no martial art has appeared out of thin air - they were all created by previous generations.</p><p></p><p>Since the ancients could create them,</p><p></p><p>why can't he do the same?</p><p></p><p>"In this world, the martial way is in decline, and mages are revered. Therefore, the martial arts in this realm are all somewhat lacking, unable to reach true perfection.</p><p></p><p>Even as powerful as the Five Viscera Sutra, it is not truly perfect.</p><p></p><p>If the Five Viscera Sutra were flawless, then the cultivation of the Primordial Precious Mirror would not bring about any changes!"</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>The main reason,</p><p></p><p>is that the martial way in this realm is deficient.</p><p></p><p>For common people to reach the level of a sect master is already the limit, and it is difficult for a great sect master to emerge even in a century.</p><p></p><p>If he were to one day reach the level of a sect master or great sect master, he would have to blaze his own trail.</p><p></p><p>If he were to simply break through the limits by improving, the cost would be too great. If he could create his own martial art, he could save a lot of that expenditure.</p><p></p><p>However—</p><p></p><p>There is another reason.</p><p></p><p>It is that Gu Qingfeng also has the idea of reviving the martial way in this realm.</p><p></p><p>"They all say that martial warriors are inferior to mages!"</p><p></p><p>"But I, Gu Qingfeng, simply do not believe that..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression became resolute.</p><p></p><p>But to create such a martial art, he must truly refine the martial arts of various schools.</p><p></p><p>Only by being flawless within himself,</p><p></p><p>can he create a truly flawless martial art.</p><p></p><p>But for now,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has not yet reached that level of perfection.</p><p></p><p>—</p><p></p><p>Night fell.</p><p></p><p>The ancient city had lost some of the liveliness of the day.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, suddenly a towering flame burst forth, a blazing light slicing through the night sky, accompanied by fierce battle cries, completely shattering the tranquility of the ancient city.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Ying Sect, Zhu Que Sect, how dare you invade my Shen Sha Gate, seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>From within the Shen Sha Gate, the enraged expression of the Sect Master Luo Yiwei was filled with fury, and with each swing of his massive hand, it struck out like a fan, instantly reducing a Tian Ying Sect cultivator at the Blood Refining Realm to a pulp, killing him on the spot.</p><p></p><p>At that moment,</p><p></p><p>two powerful gusts of wind assailed him, causing Luo Yi's expression to turn grave as he struck out with lightning speed with both hands, colliding fiercely with the attacks.</p><p></p><p>The three forces collided.</p><p></p><p>Luo Yi's body shook, and he retreated three steps, each step leaving a clear footprint on the stone floor.</p><p></p><p>"Yan Xiong!"</p><p></p><p>"Du Gu Jin!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Yi's gaze turned icy.</p><p></p><p>In his line of sight, there had appeared an elderly man in black robes, as well as a woman in a red long dress.</p><p></p><p>Tian Ying Sect Leader Yan Xiong! Zhu Que Sect Leader Du Gu Jin!</p><p></p><p>Both were high-level cultivators at the Bone Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>Luo Yi hadn't expected that this time the two major sects would join forces to ambush his Shen Sha Gate.</p><p></p><p>"You two dare to attack my Shen Sha Gate, are you not afraid of the wrath of the Zhuo Clan!?"</p><p></p><p>His voice was cold.</p><p></p><p>At the mention of the Zhuo Clan, a trace of trepidation flashed in the eyes of the two.</p><p></p><p>Then,</p><p></p><p>Yan Xiong's expression turned grim: "Luo Yi, don't think the people of the Zhuo Clan can come to your rescue. The Upper Guan Family and the Crimson Flame Sect have already joined forces, and the powerful experts of the Zhuo Clan are likely already entangled and unable to break free.</p><p></p><p>This time, you can blame your Shen Sha Gate for siding with the wrong faction. After today, the Taishan Dao will no longer have the Shen Sha Gate!"</p><p></p><p>As if to confirm Yan Xiong's words,</p><p></p><p>at the moment his words fell, terrifying auras erupted from outside the ancient city, accompanied by the furious roars of experts from the Zhuo Clan.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>Luo Yi's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the Azure Yang Sect was destroyed, the major powers of Guangyang Prefecture all wanted to seize control of the Taishan Dao, and so they had chosen to support one of the local powers of the Taishan Dao.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Behind the Shensha Gate stood the Zhuo family.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Luo Yi was how quickly the Shangguan family and the Chihuo Sect had reached an agreement.</p><p></p><p>The two joined forces to entangle the Zhuo family's powerhouses, but they had the Tian'e Gang and the Zhuque Gang come to destroy his own Shensha Gate.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Luo Yi was well aware that the Shensha Gate had no retreat.</p><p></p><p>This battle, if he could not suppress the two major gangs, then the Taishan Road would no longer have the existence of the Shensha Gate the next day.</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Luo Yi's qi and blood surged into the sky, shining like a bright lamp in the dark night, and the mighty blood energy burst out, with a fierce tiger's gaze.</p><p></p><p>"The Shensha Gate has stood on the Taishan Road for hundreds of years, relying on its formidable strength!"</p><p></p><p>"Even if you all join forces, who will live or die is still unknown. Come, let me see who will die!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Luo Yi immediately charged towards Yan Xiong and Dugu Jin.</p><p></p><p>The full power of his Refine Bone Middle Stage erupted, causing the two to feel considerable pressure.</p><p></p><p>If it were one-on-one, neither Yan Xiong nor Dugu Jin would have the confidence to defeat Luo Yi.</p><p></p><p>As fellow Refine Bone Middle Stage cultivators, there were differences in strength.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the two joining forces, it was a different story.</p><p></p><p>"Kill! Kill Luo Yi first, then destroy the Shensha Gate!"</p><p></p><p>The two exchanged a glance and then attacked Luo Yi from left and right.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Gu Peng came.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the lord, there is news from the Taishan Road!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng swallowed a wisp of great sun qi, then looked at Gu Peng, who respectfully handed over a letter with the Gu family manor's seal.</p><p></p><p>Originally, all of Gu family's guards had been incorporated into the outer court, becoming disciples of the Gu family manor.</p><p></p><p>Then, Gu Qingfeng had Gu Peng select some of the more loyal ones for focused cultivation and placed them in various locations in Guangyang Prefecture to gather intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Opening the seal, Gu Qingfeng took out the letter inside, the yellowed paper clearly recording news from the Taishan Road.</p><p></p><p>"The Shensha Gate's master..."</p><p></p><p>"This person is indeed not simple!"</p><p></p><p>From the letter, three days ago, the Tian'e Gang and the Zhuque Gang had joined forces to attack the Shensha Gate, but were ultimately defeated by the Shensha Gate's master, who severely injured them and killed the two gang leaders, completely suppressing the situation.</p><p></p><p>The Shensha Gate's master, Luo Yi, was at the Refine Bone Middle Stage.</p><p></p><p>The other two gang leaders were also at the Refine Bone Middle Stage.</p><p></p><p>Yet, they were no match for Luo Yi.</p><p></p><p>This shows that the foundation and inner strength of this Shensha Gate master are indeed profound.</p><p></p><p>"Now that the Tian'e Gang and the Zhuque Gang have been destroyed, according to the rules, the Shangguan family and the Chihuo Sect should also withdraw, right?"</p><p></p><p>As Gu Qingfeng spoke, the blood qi in his palm erupted, instantly shattering the paper.</p><p></p><p>Since not long ago, the major ancient families and sects had been directly confronting each other, with both sides suffering the loss of many powerhouses. They had then established rules, each supporting one faction to compete for dominance over the Taishan Road.</p><p></p><p>The winner would be able to control the Taishan Road.</p><p></p><p>This was done to reduce their own losses.</p><p></p><p>After all, if they were to fight to the death for the Taishan Road, it would be a lose-lose situation for both sides.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng said, "Currently, the Shensha Gate supported by the Zhuo family seems to have a good chance, but I'm afraid the other factions may join forces, and the Zhuo family may not be able to withstand them."</p><p></p><p>"Whether they can withstand it or not, we'll just observe the situation calmly," Gu Qingfeng said with a faint smile, hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>"And the other defeated sects and families may not necessarily follow the rules. If someone decides to overturn the table, that would be interesting..."</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

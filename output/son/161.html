        <h1>Chapter 161</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled calmly, and as his words fell, a strong sense of self-confidence emanated from him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun slightly shook his head, not knowing how to persuade him.</p><p></p><p>Until now,</p><p></p><p>he suddenly realized that</p><p></p><p>for a powerful expert like Gu Qingfeng, retreating without a fight did not align with his inner beliefs.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun sighed, "Since Brother Gu is so determined, I won't say much more. I will stay in Guangyang Prefecture for the next period of time. </p><p></p><p>If Brother Gu truly needs anything, Gu will not refuse!"</p><p></p><p>He did not want Gu Qingfeng to fight against Gu Yuting, after all, the variables were too great.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Qingfeng was so resolute, Gu Yun had no way to stop him.</p><p></p><p>If he forcefully tried to obstruct him,</p><p></p><p>it might even worsen the relationship between the two.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun naturally would not be impolite.</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Gu Yun did not linger in the manor, and immediately took his leave.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang then had someone escort Gu Yun out.</p><p></p><p>After the other party left, Gu Yang asked, "Father, what do you think about the words spoken by the Sect Master of the Divine Martial Sect? How much of it is true and how much is false?"</p><p></p><p>"The truth or falsehood is not important. In the face of absolute strength, any schemes or tricks are useless. However, you can focus on investigating the matters of the Divine Martial Sect, especially that Martial Ancestor. If what Gu Yun said is true, then that Martial Ancestor must be a powerful expert who has broken through the limits of the Grand Martial Masters, and he must have great secrets!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said.</p><p></p><p>For thousands of years, there had been no one in the world who could break through the limits of the Grand Martial Masters. </p><p></p><p>This shows that</p><p></p><p>to break through the barrier of the Grand Martial Masters is no easier than ascending to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>That Martial Ancestor was able to break through, it would be impossible for him to have no secrets.</p><p></p><p>"I'll have someone investigate it right away!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Yang nodded.</p><p></p><p>With the forces he currently commands, investigating some matters would be relatively easy.</p><p></p><p>"The Heaven Yang Sword Sect is likely to arrive soon, you should also be prepared. Once Gu Yuting falls, it will be the time for them to dispatch troops to other prefectures and occupy Taishan Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the person in front of him and reminded him.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang naturally nodded.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the entire world, Guangyang Prefecture has always been too small.</p><p></p><p>In the current situation, Gu Yang cannot proceed step-by-step.</p><p></p><p>Normally,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang should take Guangyang Prefecture as the foundation, quietly accumulate some strength, and then gradually scheme to control Taishan Prefecture, and then the entire Qingyun State.</p><p></p><p>But the problem is that</p><p></p><p>now the heroes are all contending in the Central State.</p><p></p><p>No one can guarantee when the war in the Central State will end.</p><p></p><p>Once the war ends,</p><p></p><p>it means a new emperor will emerge, and a new dynasty will replace the Taixuan Dynasty as the ruler of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>At that time,</p><p></p><p>if Gu Yang only has the strength of one prefecture, trying to contend with such forces would be like hitting a rock with an egg.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang must seize Taishan Prefecture, or even the entire Qingyun State, in the shortest possible time, so that he will have the qualifications to compete with other forces.</p><p></p><p>Even in the worst-case scenario, he will not be completely powerless.</p><p></p><p>While Gu Yang was making preparations, Gu Qingfeng was also in seclusion, gradually adjusting his own condition.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng looked down on the Heaven Yang Sword Sect and did not believe that Gu Yuting...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Heaven could be his own opponent, but this battle was especially important, so he had to be absolutely prepared.</p><p></p><p>â€”</p><p></p><p>"Kill Jiang Shidao!"</p><p></p><p>"This person's strength is truly not simple!"</p><p></p><p>Among the entourage of the Tian Yang Sword Sect, Gu Yetian sat, listening to the reports from his subordinates, his eerie expression cold and emotionless.</p><p></p><p>Gong Lei said softly, "Sect Master, it is said that Jiang Shidao is only half a step away from the Transformation Realm, yet Gu Qingfeng was able to kill him with a single stroke from afar, his strength clearly not simple.</p><p></p><p>If we were to engage him directly, we would need to be more cautious."</p><p></p><p>"Being only half a step away from the Transformation Realm is still just half a step, he has not truly taken that crucial step, and is still vastly inferior to the Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's ability to kill him with a single stroke may seem impressive, but in my eyes it is nothing.</p><p></p><p>However, this kind of great master has given me a pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>Originally, I would have only had a 30% chance of breaking through by consuming him, but now, I should have at least a 50% chance!"</p><p></p><p>As Gu Yetian said this, a bloodthirsty gleam appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, </p><p>he closed his eyes and fell silent, his aura becoming increasingly bizarre, causing Gong Lei to not dare speak further.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half a day later.</p><p>The Tian Yang Sword Sect's entourage had entered Guangyang Prefecture, the vast prefecture city visible in the distance.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p>the powerful experts within the prefecture city all seemed to sense something, turning their gazes towards the area outside the city, their expressions somewhat shocked.</p><p></p><p>"This aura... Could it be that he has arrived?"</p><p></p><p>"Gu Yetian!!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately,</p><p>these powerful experts could not sit still, one after another leaving their residences and heading towards the area outside the city.</p><p></p><p>In a certain side room, Gu Yun also sensed something, and when he came to the city wall, he saw a figure seated in the Tian Yang Sword Sect's entourage. </p><p></p><p>The latter also seemed to sense something, opening his blood-red eyes and meeting Gu Yun's gaze.</p><p></p><p>"So it's you!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yetian's mouth curled into a sinister smile, the bloodthirsty intent flowing from his blood-red eyes, like a hunter who had spotted a tantalizing prey.</p><p></p><p>Sect Master Gu Yun of the Shen Wu Sect! Gu Yetian was naturally no stranger to him.</p><p></p><p>It just surprised him that this person would appear here.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p>Gu Yetian saw this as a good thing.</p><p>After all, Gu Yun's strength was also not weak, and if Gu Qingfeng failed to allow him to break through, then consuming Gu Yun could further increase his chances of a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>On the other side,</p><p>when Gu Yun met Gu Yetian's blood-red eyes, his mind was also in turmoil, a strong sense of danger welling up in his heart, making him have an urge to turn and flee.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Yetian... This person's strength is truly unfathomable!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun was filled with trepidation.</p><p>Even without them engaging in battle, he understood that his strength was completely no match for Gu Yetian's.</p><p>Especially after seeing those blood-colored eyes, Gu Yun finally realized why Gu Yetian was so eager to act.</p><p>It was because the evil entity within him was about to awaken.</p><p></p><p>"The evil entity is about to revive, this battle will either be Gu Yetian's breakthrough, or the complete revival of the terrifying calamity-level evil entity within him. If this evil entity cannot be suppressed, it will be a great trouble!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun's expression fluctuated, but the revival of the evil entity was already a matter for the future, for now it was just a question of whether Gu Qingfeng could truly defeat Gu Yun.</p><p>If he could win, that would be the best.</p><p>But if he were to be defeated, then everything would be in vain."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

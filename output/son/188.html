        <h1>Chapter 188</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Sun Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>The ancient divine cultivator was soaking in a pool of blood-red water, emitting a pungent and foul odor.</p><p></p><p>Surrounding the pool, numerous corpses could be seen, all drained of their lifeblood.</p><p></p><p>Each person's face was frozen in an expression of either terror or rage.</p><p></p><p>"Thump!"</p><p></p><p>"Thump! Thump!"</p><p></p><p>The sound of a heartbeat suddenly appeared, growing louder, eerily out of place in this grisly scene.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the ancient divine cultivator's skin, something seemed to be stirring, as if crawling insects. From behind him, a strange and monstrous figure was emerging, its chilling and sinister aura spreading throughout the Heavenly Sun Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>All the sect's cultivators felt a chill, as if being watched by a terrifying presence.</p><p></p><p>The sky suddenly darkened.</p><p></p><p>When everyone looked up, they saw a bizarre phantom hovering above the Heavenly Sun Sword Sect, blotting out the sun.</p><p></p><p>Some of the sect elders, rather than being fearful, had expressions of barely contained delight on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic phantom!"</p><p>"The transformation of all things!"</p><p></p><p>This was the symbol of breaking through to the Transformation of All Things realm, a higher level of cultivation where one sheds their mortal body and ascends.</p><p></p><p>In the mouths of all practitioners, the Transformation of All Things realm was spoken of as a stepping stone to immortality. Those who reached this level were said to have one foot already in the realm of the divine.</p><p></p><p>This ominous phenomenon signified that the Heavenly Sun Sword Sect was about to produce another cultivator who had reached the Transformation of All Things realm.</p><p></p><p>The continued legacy of an immortal sect depended on whether it could maintain cultivators at this exalted level.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the previous sect leader's demise, the Heavenly Sun Sword Sect had technically lost its status as an immortal sect. It had only been spared so far due to the current turmoil, with other powers too occupied to target it.</p><p></p><p>But once the larger situation stabilized, or if other sects found the opportunity, the Heavenly Sun Sword Sect would be in grave danger, for the resources of an immortal sect were always coveted.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Heavenly Sun Sword Sect had to produce a Transformation of All Things cultivator to secure its legacy.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the celestial anomalies vanished.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the blood-robed ancient divine cultivator appeared in the sect's main hall, his aura now even colder and exuding a powerful, oppressive presence that made all the elders feel a sense of dread.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Sect Master, on breaking through to the Transformation of All Things realm!" someone hastily said, with the others quickly following suit with respectful bows.</p><p></p><p>The ancient divine cultivator smiled, though his expression seemed sinister and unsettling.</p><p></p><p>"This breakthrough to the Transformation of All Things realm was only possible thanks to the sacrifices of the people of three cities. Without the offering of tens of thousands of lives, I would not have been able to achieve this so easily."</p><p></p><p>Three cities. Hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p></p><p>Such news, if it were to spread, would undoubtedly cause a great upheaval. Yet the Heavenly Sun Sword Sect's upper echelons remained unfazed, as if the lives of tens of thousands were no more significant than that of ants.</p><p></p><p>"As long as the Sect Master has broken through, everything we have done is worthwhile."</p><p></p><p>"Be it three cities or three hundred cities, if their people can serve as nourishment for the Sect Master's advancement, it is the greatest honor they could ever hope for!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the ancient divine cultivator's smile grew even wider.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The smile on his face receded a bit. "Although I have already broken through the Hua Sheng realm, that Guangyang King is not easy to deal with. Relying solely on myself to deal with the Guangyang King still has some shortcomings."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Divine Penetration spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the Hua Sheng realm, he naturally understood the power of this realm.</p><p></p><p>Even just entering the Hua Sheng realm, one would be several times stronger than when they were at the half-step Hua Sheng realm.</p><p></p><p>But precisely because he understood the power of the Hua Sheng realm, the Ancient Divine Penetration was clear about how great the gap was between himself and Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>A Guangyang King, the Ancient Divine Penetration was not afraid of.</p><p></p><p>But the Hegemon Blade Sacred Warrior behind the Guangyang King was the existence that the Ancient Divine Penetration truly dreaded.</p><p></p><p>He himself had only just entered the Hua Sheng realm, while the Ancient Heavenly Emperor had already reached the peak of the Hua Sheng realm, and even had one foot in the Tong Shen realm.</p><p></p><p>But even so, he was still slain by Gu Qingfeng with a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Divine Penetration was deeply wary of Gu Qingfeng's strength.</p><p></p><p>To contend with such a powerful expert, he would need to be at least at the Tong Shen realm level of strength.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, the Ancient Divine Penetration said, "Inform the Pei family to accelerate the speed of the blood sacrifice. If necessary, the entire Blood Mountain Prefecture can be completely sacrificed. As long as we awaken that evil spirit, there may be a real chance to deal with that Sacred Warrior.</p><p></p><p>That evil spirit, if not for the injuries on its body, our Tian Yang Sword Sect would not have found it so easy to suppress it back then.</p><p></p><p>If we can truly awaken it and restore its strength to the fullest, even Tong Shen realm experts may not necessarily be able to subdue it!"</p><p></p><p>This was the foundation of the Ancient Divine Penetration's confidence in dealing with Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Yang wanted to occupy the Southern Yang Prefecture, then he would release the evil spirit of the Blood Mountain Prefecture, letting the two sides fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>Even if Gu Yang were to withdraw from the Southern Yang Prefecture at a critical moment, it would be useless.</p><p></p><p>It's simple.</p><p></p><p>The evil spirit is greedy.</p><p></p><p>Especially the qi and blood of cultivators, which have a great allure to the evil spirit.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Southern Yang Prefecture is connected to the Tai Mountain Prefecture. Once the evil spirit of the Blood Mountain Prefecture is unleashed, it will slaughter the entire Southern Yang Prefecture. The next target will definitely be the Tai Mountain Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the two sides will still have a battle.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, in the Ancient Divine Penetration's view, Gu Qingfeng would not be able to stand idly by if the evil spirit of the Blood Mountain Prefecture emerged.</p><p></p><p>After all, if the evil spirit were to devour a large number of civilian lives and grow in strength again, the difficulty in dealing with it would only increase.</p><p></p><p>This can be called a cunning plan.</p><p></p><p>The evil spirit will emerge, and the Guangyang King will be the first to be affected.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Tian Yang Sword Sect will also be affected.</p><p></p><p>But the Ancient Divine Penetration has already prepared to lead the entire Tian Yang Sword Sect to withdraw from the Southern Yang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>As long as they abandon the sect's foundation, even if the Southern Yang Prefecture is thrown into chaos by the evil spirit, it will have nothing to do with them.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Tian Yang Sword Sect has no other choice.</p><p></p><p>The remaining elders exchanged glances, and they all saw determination and ruthlessness in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master has given the order, and we must obey. But I'm afraid the Pei family may not be willing to go this far."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, the Pei family has no retreat left. Either they release the evil spirit of the Blood Mountain Prefecture and fight to the death, or they wait to be destroyed by the Guangyang King. Pei Sheng is a smart person, he will know how to act!"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Divine Penetration sneered coldly, not at all worried that the Pei family would refuse.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, the Pei family had already lost any chance of retreat.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

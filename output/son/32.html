        <h1>Chapter 32</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The members of the Qin family were immediately enraged.</p><p></p><p>The patriarch of the Qin family also had a gloomy expression, his voice full of malice.</p><p></p><p>"The head of the Gu family is still young, so he shouldn't be too arrogant. The waters of the jianghu (martial arts world) are not as simple as you think.</p><p></p><p>The Qin family has stood tall in the jianghu for many years, and we are not without our own foundations.</p><p></p><p>You and I should still value the principle of 'harmony brings wealth'. If we really tear off the masks, it may not necessarily be to our advantage!"</p><p></p><p>"It's not that I, Gu Qingfeng, am young, but that you are old. In the jianghu, there is no such thing as 'harmony brings wealth', only who has the bigger fist!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng let out a loud laugh, then stepped forward, his qi and blood surging like rolling wolf smoke towards the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Fist is power!"</p><p></p><p>"Now that my fist is powerful enough, it is I who will set the rules of this jianghu!"</p><p></p><p>"I have already given your Qin family a chance. Since you don't cherish it, then the Qin family has no reason to exist anymore--"</p><p></p><p>The words fell.</p><p></p><p>The fist struck.</p><p></p><p>The fierce and tyrannical force shattered the air, and a terrifying pressure erupted with a thunderous roar, causing the Qin family patriarch's face to change drastically.</p><p></p><p>"You insolent boy, how dare you!"</p><p></p><p>The old man of the Qin family was enraged, and the seemingly frail and withered body suddenly surged with powerful qi and blood. The sunken, shriveled skin was now plump and full.</p><p></p><p>His two fingers came together, swift as a meteor, fast as lightning. The countless finger shadows dazzled the eyes, each containing the mighty force to split mountains and rocks.</p><p></p><p>This was the Qin family's supreme clan technique - the Meteor Piercing the Clouds Fingers! However.</p><p></p><p>As Gu Qingfeng's fist struck out, there was a cracking sound, and the countless finger shadows dissipated. The Qin family patriarch's face contorted in pain, and his right hand's two fingers had been twisted and broken.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, Gu Qingfeng's fist only had a few white marks, showing no signs of being breached.</p><p></p><p>Then.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng surged forward again, striking out with the Dual Palm Primal Strike. The fierce and unparalleled palm force contained a mighty and scorching aura, causing the Qin family patriarch to feel the scorching waves rushing towards him.</p><p></p><p>Under such an attack, the Qin family patriarch was overwhelmed by a rare sense of fear.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to beg for mercy, but it was too late.</p><p></p><p>So, facing Gu Qingfeng's fierce and powerful palm strike, the Qin family patriarch could only muster all his foundations to try and resist.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>The palms came down.</p><p></p><p>The Qin family patriarch's body was instantly sent flying, and several Qin family disciples were knocked down, their bones broken by the tremendous force. They didn't even have a chance to scream before they died on the spot.</p><p></p><p>When the Qin family patriarch landed, he coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood and then fell silent.</p><p></p><p>All of this happened in the blink of an eye, from Gu Qingfeng's strike to the Qin family patriarch's demise, in just a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>When the others finally reacted, the Qin family patriarch had already perished on the spot.</p><p></p><p>This scene caused everyone to change their expressions.</p><p></p><p>The Qin family patriarch! </p><p></p><p>He was a renowned expert in the jianghu for many years.</p><p></p><p>Although he had not personally taken action for a long time, his reputation had not diminished at all.</p><p></p><p>However, </p><p></p><p>this powerful expert was directly slain by Gu Qingfeng in just a few rounds.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's strength shocked everyone.</p><p></p><p>Especially the people from the Four Seas Gang who had followed behind, they felt immense relief after witnessing Gu Qingfeng's terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately!</p><p></p><p>They had already submitted to the Gu family in advance.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, </p><p></p><p>offending such a powerful expert would have had unimaginable consequences.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>The members of the Qin family all had sorrowful expressions, and many were filled with fear. The Qin family's only cultivator who had reached the Blood Refining realm had perished, and the strength of the Gu family was clearly beyond their ability to contend with.</p><p></p><p>Just as Qin Hongtang was about to open his mouth to plead, Gu Qingfeng waved his hand dismissively and issued a cold order.</p><p></p><p>"Kill, not a single member of the Qin family shall be spared today!"</p><p></p><p>With that said, </p><p></p><p>Meng Peng immediately led the Gu family guards to charge towards the Qin family.</p><p></p><p>Maoronghiu and the other forces subservient to the Gu family also did not dare to be negligent, hastily following behind the Gu family to join the attack.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Qin Hongtang's eyes were about to burst: "Gu Qingfeng, do you really intend to exterminate the entire Qin family?"</p><p></p><p>"I have already given you a chance. I, Gu Qingfeng, do not go back on my word. Today, I will annihilate your Qin family completely!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression remained indifferent as he stepped forward, appearing within a dozen feet of Qin Hongtang, and suddenly struck out with a palm, causing the Qin family patriarch's complexion to change drastically.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Although Qin Hongtang fought with all his might, he was only at the Blood Refining realm, and his strength was vastly inferior to Gu Qingfeng's. With a single strike, his chest was crushed inward, and he did not even have the chance to let out a scream before being completely slain.</p><p></p><p>Having killed Qin Hongtang,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's movements did not stop, and he continued to charge towards the remaining Qin family warriors.</p><p></p><p>Against his cultivation at the half-step Bone Forging realm, the Qin family warriors were like paper, unable to withstand even a single strike of his Scorching Sun Divine Palm, all perishing on the spot.</p><p></p><p>In less than an hour,</p><p></p><p>All the Blood Refining realm warriors of the Qin family had been completely slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>The remaining Skin Refining realm warriors were also massacred to the last by Meng Peng and the forces of the Four Seas Gang.</p><p></p><p>After all, although the Four Seas Gang was not as strong as the Qin family, their own foundation was still not weak. At least at the Skin Refining realm, they had many experts stationed to guard their interests.</p><p></p><p>With Meng Peng, a newly promoted Blood Refining realm cultivator, leading them, dealing with the Qin family warriors was no problem at all.</p><p></p><p>When the last warrior fell, Meng Peng came before Gu Qingfeng and clasped his fists, reporting, "My lord, all the Qin family warriors have been slain."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Qingfeng gave him a sidelong glance, his voice indifferent and devoid of any emotional fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>"I intend to exterminate the entire Qin family. If you stop now, are you trying to make me break my word to the people?"</p><p></p><p>These words struck Meng Peng's heart with a chill.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng's tone was indifferent, Meng Peng could sense the icy killing intent within. It was clear that he was displeased with Meng Peng's attempt to halt the massacre.</p><p></p><p>Immediately,</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng did not dare to hesitate, raising his butcher's knife towards the remaining members of the Qin family, his expression ruthless.</p><p></p><p>"The lord has commanded, not a single member of the Qin family shall be spared, kill them all!"</p><p></p><p>With this order given,</p><p></p><p>The slaughter resumed.</p><p></p><p>The Qin family members let out agonizing screams, and some even cursed before their deaths.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Qingfeng, may you meet with an ill fate!"</p><p></p><p>"Your actions are cruel, and even as ghosts, we will not let you off!"</p><p></p><p>Listening to the curses of the Qin family members as they faced their deaths, Gu Qingfeng's expression remained indifferent, his face showing no change whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>Eradicating the roots!</p><p></p><p>This was something that must be done when navigating the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>If he had not torn down the facade with the Qin family, it would have been fine. But since he had fallen out with them, he must see this through to the end.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not wish for his current merciful heart to bring him unnecessary trouble in the future.</p><p></p><p>As for the so-called curses, Gu Qingfeng paid them no mind.</p><p></p><p>In this jianghu,</p><p></p><p>Strength and power were the only things that truly mattered!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The purpose of the other party's visit was to discuss the immortal clan families and the forging of the Immortal Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had obtained the answer he wanted, he naturally did not stay long.</p><p></p><p>After all, the world was not yet settled.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang, the King of Guangyang, naturally did not have much free time.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Yang left, Gu Qingfeng also looked back at his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>However, the attribute panel showed no changes.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Immortal Pavilion is not a cultivation technique or martial art, but rather something akin to a secret technique!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered.</p><p></p><p>Many secret techniques are not recorded in the attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was not too surprised by this change.</p><p></p><p>However, what really caught his attention was the appearance of the Immortal Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>This mysterious secret technique was beyond the creation of today's martial artists.</p><p></p><p>In the distant past, before the Martial Ancestor's conquest of the world, the martial arts of the Nine Provinces were still in a nascent state.</p><p></p><p>Although some had awakened to their own potential and mastered extraordinary powers, they were at most a match for ten or even a hundred people.</p><p></p><p>It was not until the Martial Ancestor appeared and conquered the world that the martial arts of this world truly flourished.</p><p></p><p>"So, where did the Martial Ancestor come from?"</p><p></p><p>"Since the Immortal Pavilion has appeared, it means that in the ancient past, this world had once experienced unimaginable glory!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, many of Gu Qingfeng's doubts were dispelled.</p><p></p><p>Things he had previously only vaguely suspected became much clearer.</p><p></p><p>He could be certain that this world was not as simple as it appeared.</p><p></p><p>Beyond the Nine Provinces, there might exist an even vaster realm.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Gu Qingfeng's gaze turned to another direction - the Ancient Beast Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>This mountain range, spanning several provinces, was like a natural barrier, protecting the Nine Provinces within.</p><p></p><p>Some had speculated that beyond the Nine Provinces lay the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, and at the end of the mountain range might be another realm even vaster than the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>However, these rumors were often dismissed as mere fiction, and few paid them any real attention.</p><p></p><p>After all, the mountain range was filled with countless dangers, and even Grandmasters would have difficulty surviving within.</p><p></p><p>But in Gu Qingfeng's eyes, these fictional tales might actually be true.</p><p></p><p>Beyond the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, there might indeed exist an even vaster realm.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng had no immediate plans to explore it, as the unknown often represented great peril.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could steadily develop the Gu Clan, he would have a constant source of cultivation resources to improve his own strength.</p><p></p><p>But this did not mean others would be content to simply stay put.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had no intention of interfering with or guiding the actions of others.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he should visit the Martial State at some point, as that was where the Martial Ancestor had attained enlightenment. There might be some information about the Martial Ancestor to be found there.</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Gu Qingfeng turned his attention back to the Immortal Pavilion, determined to study this mysterious technique in-depth.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Continuing upwards.</p><p></p><p>They can now impact the Refining Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also noticed the changes in the two of them.</p><p></p><p>So when he saw the news of their breakthroughs on the information panel, Gu Qingfeng was not too surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Sheng Xing and Sheng An's natural talents are not bad, but they are still a bit inferior to Sheng Nan!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking.</p><p></p><p>The two of them are the descendants left behind by the profound Gu Yang, so their natural talents should be stronger than Gu Shengnan's.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, it is not the case.</p><p></p><p>Gu Shengnan's natural talent is significantly stronger than the two of them.</p><p></p><p>From this, it can be seen that not all martial cultivators with profound attainments will necessarily have powerful descendants, just as ordinary people's descendants are not necessarily mediocre in talent.</p><p></p><p>These things are simply a matter of probability.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>There is one more point.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Shengxing and Gu Sheng'an's talents are not as good as Gu Shengnan's, they can still be considered geniuses in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at his own attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng  Age: 50/3000  Realm: Extreme Dao Grandmaster Late Stage</p><p></p><p>Martial Arts: Heaven Thunder Sword Technique (Initiate), Prajna Sutra (13th Layer Perfected, 12th Level Prajna True Body), Heavenly Vein Sutra (2nd Layer), Longevity Technique (Perfected, 5th Level Longevity), Pure Yang True Body (Perfected, 4th Level Flesh Body Purification), Heaven Saber (Perfected, 1st Level Heaven Saber Realm), Refining Blood Sutra (7th Layer, 7th Level Divine Blood), Divine Movement Hundred Transformations (Perfected, 4th Level Divine Speed)  Upgrade Points: 342...</p><p></p><p>"Fifty years old!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sighed a little.</p><p></p><p>At fifty, one knows the Mandate of Heaven! For ordinary people, this age is already halfway through their life.</p><p></p><p>But for him, fifty years old has little impact.</p><p></p><p>His qi and blood are abundant.</p><p></p><p>His physical body is robust.</p><p></p><p>Apart from making Gu Qingfeng more mature, the passage of time has left no other traces on him.</p><p></p><p>But this is normal.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary people who do not live to a hundred years old, fifty years is already half a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>But for Gu Qingfeng's current lifespan of three thousand years, fifty years is nothing.</p><p></p><p>Even if it were five hundred years old,</p><p></p><p>it would not make him feel old.</p><p></p><p>This extremely long lifespan naturally has tremendous benefits.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng put aside his inner thoughts and looked at the Refining Blood Sutra, directly using the upgrade points to break through it to perfection.</p><p></p><p>He had originally wanted to cultivate the Refining Blood Sutra himself, but unfortunately, the idea was good, but reality often differed greatly from the idea.</p><p></p><p>During this period.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has been cultivating the Refining Blood Sutra all along.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately.</p><p></p><p>He has never been able to cultivate this technique to perfection.</p><p></p><p>Now that he has enough upgrade points, Gu Qingfeng is too lazy to waste time.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the corresponding upgrade points disappeared, and the Refining Blood Sutra directly advanced from the 7th Layer to the 8th Layer of perfection.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The Refining Blood Sutra reached perfection.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng only felt a terrifying and majestic qi and blood power surge out from his physical body, and the qi and blood surged, as if undergoing a powerful transformation.</p><p></p><p>The surging qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>Like a rushing river.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng could clearly feel that his strength was gradually increasing, advancing towards a higher level.</p><p></p><p>But this feeling did not last long and gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Finally.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng opened his eyes and let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Refining Blood Sutra (Perfected, 8th Level Divine Blood)!...</p><p></p><p>"The Refining Blood Sutra has finally reached perfection, but unfortunately, it still couldn't make me break through to the Perfected Realm of the Extreme Dao Grandmaster!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was a little regretful.</p><p></p><p>He could clearly feel that his qi and blood were already powerful, and he was just a step away from the breakthrough, as if he only needed to accumulate a little more power to take that step.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>Just a little short.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also understood that his perception was just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Although it seemed like he was just a step away from the breakthrough, in reality, the difficulty of actually taking that step was not as simple as it felt.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Even though his cultivation did not break through.</p><p></p><p>The perfection of the Refining Blood Sutra has still increased Gu Qingfeng's own strength.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not have the idea of breaking the limit of the Refining Blood Sutra, after all, it is already a top-tier Grand Master's supreme technique, and breaking through it would require stepping into an even higher realm.</p><p></p><p>That level requires two thousand upgrade points.</p><p></p><p>So Gu Qingfeng chose to cultivate other martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Now that Gu Yang possesses nearly half of the Nine Provinces, the martial arts he has collected are numerous, even the rare Grand Master's supreme techniques are collected in large numbers.</p><p></p><p>These martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Are now placed in the Whetstone Hall.</p><p></p><p>These martial arts include sword techniques, fist techniques, and techniques that focus on cultivating true qi or refining the physical body and blood.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng finally set his sights on a martial art.</p><p></p><p>The Eighteen-Zhang Golden Body!</p><p></p><p>This is a supreme technique of the Buddhist sect! Thousands of years ago, a great Grand Master of the Buddhist sect sat in meditation for three hundred years under the Bodhi tree and attained this top-tier martial art.</p><p></p><p>If one can cultivate this technique to great accomplishment, one can forge the Buddha's Golden Body, where blades and spears cannot harm, and even if the body perishes and turns to ash, it can remain incorruptible for a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>It can be said.</p><p></p><p>The Eighteen-Zhang Golden Body is a top-tier martial art no weaker than the Refining Blood Sutra.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the existence of the Buddhist sect.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has also heard about it.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of years ago.</p><p></p><p>The Buddhist sect was prosperous, being the national religion of the previous dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Later, with the fall of the previous dynasty and the rise of the Taixuan Dynasty, the Buddhist and Taoist sects were eradicated, and most of the monks in the world perished.</p><p></p><p>Until now.</p><p></p><p>Although there are still traces of the Buddhist sect in the world, they have become the dregs of the jianghu, unable to ascend to the heights of the past.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how it is said.</p><p></p><p>The Buddhist sect was once glorious.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of its time, there were many top-tier experts in existence.</p><p></p><p>This Eighteen-Zhang Golden Body technique was accidentally obtained by Gu Yang from an old Buddhist site, and then ordered to be sent to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>As for why a top-tier martial art from thousands of years ago fell into Gu Yang's hands, Gu Qingfeng could only attribute it to Gu Yang's powerful fortune.</p><p></p><p>The concept of fortune.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng firmly believes in it.</p><p></p><p>Especially after witnessing the existence of the Forged Immortal Pavilion, Gu Qingfeng understood the true nature of fortune even more.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's ability to obtain the inheritances of many mysterious experts and find the method of the Forged Immortal Pavilion is due to his great fortune.</p><p></p><p>After a long time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng finally committed all the details about the Eighteen-Zhang Golden Body to memory.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after.</p><p></p><p>On the attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>There was also a record of the Eighteen-Zhang Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>This martial art, like the Refining Blood Sutra, starts at the Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>The difference is.</p><p></p><p>The Eighteen-Zhang Golden Body has nine layers, and its eighth layer already reaches the peak of the Grand Master realm, and the ninth layer, although it does not break the limit of the Grand Master, also faintly touches upon an even more profound realm.</p><p></p><p>Before carefully studying the Eighteen-Zhang Golden Body, Gu Qingfeng thought this martial art was on par with the Refining Blood Sutra.</p><p></p><p>But now, a look at it.</p><p></p><p>This martial art is even stronger than the Refining Blood Sutra.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 115</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shen Wudao! Upon hearing the other party's name, Gu Qingfeng immediately understood that this was the grand master of the Shen Quan Sect from hundreds of years ago.</p><p></p><p>Shen Quan Wudao!</p><p></p><p>The top expert of the Liuyun Manor! In the present day.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng realized that this person had already achieved the cultivation of demonic arts, becoming a sorcerer.</p><p></p><p>How powerful a sorcerer cultivated from a martial arts grandmaster could be, Gu Qingfeng did not know, but the overwhelming aura emanating from the other party ignited his fighting spirit even more.</p><p></p><p>"Sorcerer Grandmaster!"</p><p></p><p>"The Shen Quan Sect is indeed not that simple!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Gu Qingfeng's words,</p><p></p><p>Shen Wudao smiled slightly. He didn't even glance at the corpse on the ground, his gaze fixed on Gu Qingfeng the entire time.</p><p></p><p>"You give me a very good impression, and you are also very strong. If I were to devour you, I might be able to break through the limits of the Refined Spirit Realm and step into the Fusion Spirit Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"But I'm curious, what realm are you in? Not a Qi and Blood Grandmaster, nor a Innate Grandmaster... Interesting, truly interesting—"</p><p></p><p>Shen Wudao seemed to be questioning Gu Qingfeng, but also talking to himself.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Shen Wudao looked at the corpse on the ground and shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, these trash of the Shen Quan Sect, after so many years, there are only a few who can step into the Demonic Refinement Realm. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been stuck here for so long.</p><p></p><p>These trash, whether they live or die, it's a waste of food."</p><p></p><p>Saying this,</p><p></p><p>Shen Wudao looked at Gu Qingfeng again, licking his lips, his expression becoming increasingly cold and sinister.</p><p></p><p>"I will devour you!"</p><p></p><p>"That will be enough!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell,</p><p></p><p>Shen Wudao's body suddenly disappeared from the spot like a ghost, and in the next instant, a fierce and terrifying fist came rushing towards Gu Qingfeng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The latter's expression remained unchanged, as if he had anticipated it. He also suddenly struck out with a powerful fist.</p><p></p><p>This punch,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not hold back at all.</p><p></p><p>Facing a sorcerer who had achieved the status of a grandmaster hundreds of years ago, he could not afford to be careless in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>as soon as he struck,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng put forth his full strength.</p><p></p><p>Under the terrifying revival of his qi and blood, the two fists collided, and a deafening explosion rang out, with surging shockwaves sweeping in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wudao's ghostly figure was directly sent flying backwards.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>this ancient grandmaster of the Shen Quan Sect finally revealed a look of shock on his face.</p><p></p><p>"How can your qi and blood be so powerful!!"</p><p></p><p>After landing, Shen Wudao exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that suppressing Gu Qingfeng would be an easy task, but he never expected the other party's qi and blood to be so powerful.</p><p></p><p>For a moment,</p><p></p><p>Shen Wudao almost thought he was facing a Qi and Blood Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>No—</p><p></p><p>Even an ordinary Qi and Blood Grandmaster would not have such overwhelming qi and blood power.</p><p></p><p>Before Shen Wudao could be shocked any further, he saw Gu Qingfeng stepping forward, his terrifying qi and blood power erupting in full, like the sun shining in the sky. The Demon-Slaying Sword suddenly unsheathed, its majestic and unparalleled sword light seemed capable of cleaving the heavens and earth, causing Shen Wudao's expression to change drastically again.</p><p></p><p>"Grandmaster's True Essence!!"</p><p></p><p>"You have actually mastered the Grandmaster's True Essence—"</p><p></p><p>Shen Wudao's expression was one of shock.</p><p>Seeing the long sword slashing towards him, that terrifying qi and blood power, as well as the power of the True Essence, made him finally sense the presence of death.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Suddenly,</p><p></p><p>A powerful and terrifying aura of cold energy surged up from Shen Wudao's body, and a towering black mist appeared behind him, transforming into a wrathful Vajra Buddha.</p><p></p><p>This Buddha seemed similar to the evil Buddha of the Nine Turns Dao, but its aura was completely different.</p><p></p><p>Wrathful Vajra!</p><p>Subduing demons and monsters!</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Shen Wudao seemed to be the greatest demon in the world, and within the towering black mist, not only was there the Vajra Buddha, but it also seemed that countless tormented souls were wailing and screaming.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The two terrifying forces collided, unleashing an astonishingly powerful shockwave.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's blood surged like an abyss, and the Demon-Slaying Saber shone with icy brilliance. His domineering and unparalleled saber techniques cut through the layers of black mist, the momentum of which was truly astounding.</p><p></p><p>On the other side,</p><p></p><p>Shen Wudao also transformed into a demonic Buddha, just like the wrathful Vajra, with a fist strike that shook the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Now, both of them were giving it their all, and each strike could be considered capable of shattering mountains and splitting the earth. Occasionally, when the fierce winds scattered, the impact would cause the mountains to tremble and the boulders to turn to dust.</p><p></p><p>Shocking! All the onlookers had fearful expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Whether they were the remaining disciples of the Divine Fist Sect or Gu Peng and the others, when they looked at the scene, their faces were filled with astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"This is the true power of the old Patriarch. It is truly unfathomable!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng, feeling the terrifying aura, had a slight twitch on his face, and his eyes were filled with awe and excitement.</p><p></p><p>Such power.</p><p></p><p>This is what martial artists strive for their entire lives.</p><p></p><p>Even though Gu Peng had already reached the fifth realm of Refining the Impure, he still understood that if he were to face either of the two, he would not be able to withstand them even for a moment.</p><p></p><p>As for Shen Wudao, not to mention him.</p><p></p><p>This person was a grandmaster from hundreds of years ago, with terrifying strength, and now that he had refined the demonic energy, he had reached an even higher level.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>"Boom! Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The saber energy surged, and Gu Qingfeng unleashed the full power of the Domineering Saber, and even with Shen Wudao's strength, he was still unable to gain the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>As time passed,</p><p></p><p>Shen Wudao's injuries became increasingly severe. A large amount of fresh blood flowed from his wounds, making his expression even more ferocious.</p><p></p><p>"I have been treading the path of the martial arts for hundreds of years, already reaching the grandmaster realm, and now I have even refined the demonic energy, which can be considered as transcending the mortal and entering the divine. How could I be inferior to you, a mere mortal martial artist!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Wudao let out a deep, angry roar, and the aura of cold energy around him grew even stronger. The Vajra Buddha in the black mist also became more bizarre, twisting and turning frantically, as if it was about to break free from the black mist at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Kill!</p><p>Kill! Kill!! Shen Wudao's eyes turned blood-red, like a demon crawling out of hell, and the only thought in his mind was to devour the person in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Creatures like you, neither human nor ghost, are not worthy of being called transcendent."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression turned icy cold, his internal organs shaking, and his surging blood like raging rivers and seas, causing the blood light of the Demon-Slaying Saber to grow even more intense.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the many insights he had gained into the Domineering Saber Slash, they all surged into his mind at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Instantly,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng felt as if he had opened a door in his mind, and his understanding of the Domineering Saber Slash underwent a tremendous transformation. This grandmaster-level secret technique, after reaching the initial stage and then being refined through four years of cultivation and this life-and-death battle, had finally reached the advanced stage.</p><p></p><p>Domineering Saber Slash, Advanced Stage! Domineering Saber True Intent, Level Eight!</p><p></p><p>Martial arts breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng poured all his power into the Demon-Slaying Saber and unleashed the most peak strike he had ever performed.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored saber light that pierced the heavens and the earth entered Shen Wudao's vision, and the fear of death briefly restored his clear consciousness, and the emotion of terror appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"No—"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

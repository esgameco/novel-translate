        <h1>Chapter 115</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shen Wudao! Upon hearing the other party's name, Gu Qingfeng already understood that this was the grand master of the Shen Quan Sect from hundreds of years ago.</p><p></p><p>Shen Quan Wudao! </p><p></p><p>The top expert of the Liuyun Manor! In the present day.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng realized that this person had already achieved the cultivation of demonic arts, becoming a sorcerer.</p><p></p><p>How powerful a sorcerer cultivated from a grand master martial artist, Gu Qingfeng could not know, but the overwhelming aura emanating from the other made his fighting spirit burn even hotter.</p><p></p><p>"Sorcerer grand master!"</p><p></p><p>"The Shen Quan Sect is indeed not that simple!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Gu Qingfeng's words,</p><p></p><p>Shen Wudao smiled slightly. He didn't even glance at the corpse on the ground, his gaze fixed solely on Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"You give me a very good impression, and you are also very strong. If I were to devour you, I might be able to break through the limits of the Refined Spirit Realm and step into the Merged Spirit Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"But I'm curious, what realm are you at? Not a Qi and Blood Grand Master, nor a Primal Grand Master... Interesting, truly interesting—"</p><p></p><p>Shen Wudao seemed to be questioning Gu Qingfeng, yet also talking to himself.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Shen Wudao looked at the corpse on the ground and shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, these trash of the Shen Quan Sect, after all these years they still haven't had a single one reach the Refined Impurity Realm, otherwise I wouldn't have been stuck here for so long.</p><p></p><p>These waste have died, and it's a waste of food to keep them."</p><p></p><p>Saying this,</p><p></p><p>Shen Wudao looked at Gu Qingfeng again, licking his lips, his expression becoming increasingly cold and sinister.</p><p></p><p>"I will devour you!"</p><p></p><p>"That will be enough!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell,</p><p></p><p>Shen Wudao's body suddenly vanished from the spot like a ghost, and in the next instant, a fierce and terrifying fist came rushing towards Gu Qingfeng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The latter's expression remained unchanged, as if he had anticipated it, and a powerful fist also struck out.</p><p></p><p>This punch,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng held nothing back.</p><p></p><p>Facing a sorcerer who had achieved the realm of a grand master from hundreds of years ago, he could not afford to be careless in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>the moment he struck,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng put forth his full strength.</p><p></p><p>Under the terrifying resurgence of his qi and blood, the two fists collided, and a deafening explosion rang out, sending shockwaves sweeping in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wudao's ghostly figure was directly sent flying backwards.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>this ancient grand master of the Shen Quan Sect finally revealed a look of shock on his face.</p><p></p><p>"How can your qi and blood be so powerful!!"</p><p></p><p>After landing, Shen Wudao exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that suppressing Gu Qingfeng would be an easy task, but he never expected the other's qi and blood to be so formidable.</p><p></p><p>For a moment,</p><p></p><p>Shen Wudao almost thought he was facing a Qi and Blood Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>No—</p><p></p><p>Even an ordinary Qi and Blood Grand Master would not necessarily have qi and blood power as strong as the other.</p><p></p><p>Before Shen Wudao could be shocked any further, he saw Gu Qingfeng stride forward, his terrifying qi and blood power erupting in full, like the sun blazing in the sky, and the Demon-Slaying Saber suddenly unsheathed, its majestic and unparalleled sword light seemed capable of cleaving the heavens and earth, causing Shen Wudao's expression to change drastically once again.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Master's True Essence!!"</p><p></p><p>"You have actually comprehended the Grand Master's True Essence—"</p><p></p><p>Shen Wudao's expression was one of shock.</p><p>Seeing the long saber slashing towards him, that terrifying qi and blood power, as well as the power of the True Essence, finally made him sense the scent of death.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Suddenly,</p><p></p><p>A powerful and terrifying aura of cold energy surged from Shen Wudao's body, and a towering black mist appeared behind him, transforming into a wrathful Vajra Buddha.</p><p></p><p>This Buddha seemed similar to the evil Buddha of the Nine Turns Dao, but its aura was completely different.</p><p></p><p>Wrathful Vajra!</p><p>Subduing demons and monsters!</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Shen Wudao seemed to be the greatest demon in the world, and within the towering black mist, not only was there the Vajra Buddha, but also countless tormented souls wailing in agony.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The two terrifying forces collided, unleashing an astonishingly powerful shockwave.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's blood surged like an abyss, and the Demon-Slaying Saber shone with icy brilliance. His tyrannical and unparalleled saber techniques cut through the layers of black mist, creating a shocking scene.</p><p></p><p>On the other side,</p><p></p><p>Shen Wudao also transformed into a demonic Buddha, with wrathful Vajra-like eyes and a fist strike that shook the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Now, both of them were giving it their all, and each strike could be considered capable of shattering mountains and splitting the earth. Occasionally, when the powerful winds dissipated, the surrounding mountains would tremble, and the massive rocks would turn to dust.</p><p></p><p>Shocking! Everyone watched this scene with terrified eyes.</p><p></p><p>Whether they were the remaining disciples of the Divine Fist Sect or Gu Peng and the others, their faces were filled with astonishment when they looked at the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"This is the true power of the old Patriarch. It is truly unfathomable!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng, feeling the terrifying aura, had a slight twitch on his face, and his eyes were filled with awe and excitement.</p><p></p><p>This level of power.</p><p>This is what martial artists strive for their entire lives.</p><p></p><p>Even though Gu Peng had already reached the fifth realm of Refining the Impure, he still understood that if he were to face either of the two, he would not be able to withstand them even for a moment.</p><p></p><p>As for Shen Wudao,</p><p></p><p>He was a master from hundreds of years ago, with terrifying strength, and now that he had refined the demonic energy, he had reached an even higher level.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>"Boom! Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The saber energy swept across the battlefield, and Gu Qingfeng unleashed the full power of the Tyrannical Saber, making it difficult for Shen Wudao to gain the upper hand, despite his formidable abilities.</p><p></p><p>As time passed,</p><p></p><p>Shen Wudao's injuries became increasingly severe. A large amount of fresh blood flowed from his wounds, making his expression even more ferocious.</p><p></p><p>"I have been cultivating the martial dao for hundreds of years and have already reached the level of a sect master. Now, with the demonic energy refined within me, I can be considered to have transcended the mortal realm. How could I possibly lose to a mere ordinary martial artist like you!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Wudao let out a deep, angry roar, and the aura of cold energy around him grew even stronger. The Vajra Buddha within the black mist also became more bizarre, twisting and turning, as if it was about to break free from the darkness at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Kill!</p><p>Kill! Kill!!</p><p>Shen Wudao's eyes turned blood-red, like a demon that had crawled out of the depths of hell. The only thought in his mind was to devour the person in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Creatures like you, who are neither human nor ghost, are not worthy of being called transcendent."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was cold and resolute. His internal organs were shaking, and his surging blood was like a raging river, causing the blood light of the Demon-Slaying Saber to grow even more intense.</p><p></p><p>The many insights he had gained into the Tyrannical Saber Slash were now flooding his mind.</p><p></p><p>In an instant,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng felt as if he had opened a door in his mind, and his understanding of the Tyrannical Saber Slash underwent a tremendous transformation. This sect master's ultimate technique, which had previously reached the initial stage, had now, after four years of cultivation and the current life-and-death battle, finally reached the advanced stage.</p><p></p><p>Tyrannical Saber Slash, Advanced Stage! Tyrannical Saber True Meaning, Level Eight!</p><p></p><p>Martial arts breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng poured all his power into the Demon-Slaying Saber and unleashed the most powerful strike he had ever executed.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored saber light that pierced the heavens and the earth entered Shen Wudao's vision, and the fear of death briefly restored his clarity. The emotion of terror appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"No—"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

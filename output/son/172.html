        <h1>Chapter 172</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Longevity Technique was passed down.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had his own considerations.</p><p></p><p>Although the Longevity Technique was of great significance, there was no problem in passing it down to his own people.</p><p></p><p>If the Blood Refinement Chapter could be cultivated, it could also add hundreds of years to one's lifespan. </p><p></p><p>For Gu Qingfeng, the more his descendants could live longer, the greater the benefit to him. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, Gu Xuan and the others were his own sons, so Gu Qingfeng would certainly not be stingy.</p><p></p><p>When the Longevity Technique was truly completed, Gu Qingfeng would consider passing down this cultivation method as the foundation of the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On this day, Gu Qingfeng was in seclusion in the Whetstone Hall.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Gu Peng's voice came from outside.</p><p></p><p>"Your subordinate pays respects to the Elder Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Come in."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng opened his eyes, his voice calm.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he spoke, he waved his sleeve, and the previously tightly closed hall doors opened, and Gu Peng walked in from outside.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>As Gu Qingfeng spoke, he also glanced at the information panel, but everything was normal and there was no special situation.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Peng would not come for no reason. Since he had come, there must be something that had happened.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Peng's expression was solemn: "The Nine Bend Path has unusual activity, and the Buddhist chanting has become more and more obvious in recent days. Many of the commoners outside the Nine Bend Path have been affected and died in a strange way. Your subordinate suspects that the evil Buddha at the end of the Nine Bend Path may be about to come out of there!"</p><p></p><p>The Nine Bend Path! The evil Buddha!</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this name, Gu Qingfeng's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>If there was anything in the entire Guangyang Prefecture that he was wary of, it would be the evil Buddha of the Nine Bend Path.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Qingfeng's view, the power of the evil Buddha in the Nine Bend Path was unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>At first, Gu Qingfeng had regarded it as an existence at the Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>But now, after reaching his current realm, when he looked back, the power of that evil Buddha was probably even more terrifying than the Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Gu Qingfeng wanted to make a breakthrough in his own cultivation first, and then deal with that evil Buddha when he had absolute confidence.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the unusual activity in the Nine Bend Path, Gu Qingfeng could no longer wait.</p><p></p><p>It was simple. The evil spirit strengthened its power by slaughtering living beings. If he allowed the evil Buddha to wreak havoc, it might end up slaughtering the entire Guangyang Prefecture. At that time, the power of the evil Buddha would be even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"The evil Buddha is active, has Yangzi taken any action on that side?"</p><p></p><p>"The Master is currently campaigning in various prefectures, but he has also instructed the surrounding commoners to evacuate, and the news of the unusual activity in the Nine Bend Path has also been transmitted by the Master!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The unusual activity in the Nine Bend Path. Gu Yang had transmitted the news, obviously wanting Gu Qingfeng to take action against the evil Buddha of the Nine Bend Path.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the only one in the vast Guangyang Prefecture who could possibly deal with the evil Buddha was Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>The battle in the Guangyang Prefecture capital had already established his status as the number one in the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the emergence of the evil Buddha, its terrifying might, such an existence was certainly not something that ordinary people could deal with.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The evil Buddha had emerged, and Gu Qingfeng naturally could not sit idly by.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he led Gu Peng to the Nine Bend Path.</p><p></p><p>With their Patriarch Realm cultivation, it took less than half a day to arrive directly at the Nine Bend Path.</p><p></p><p>The moment they stepped into the Nine Bend Path, a strange and icy cold aura came rushing towards them. At the same time...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The tyrannical and evil spiritual force directly assaulted Gu Qingfeng's mind. In his eyes, the scene before him transformed into a golden Buddhist stupa, with the Tathagata Buddha seated in the nine heavens, head bowed and expression serene.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next instant, a tyrannical blade intent force from Gu Qingfeng slashed through the heavens, and the golden Buddhist stupa as well as the Tathagata Buddha were reduced to ashes under this single stroke.</p><p></p><p>The scene shattered into pieces, revealing the black and red earth.</p><p></p><p>Deathly silence! The entire Nine Curved Path was now shrouded in deathly silence. Only in the void, a blood-soaked Buddha's phantom sat in meditation, its eyes bleeding, its expression bizarre - a smile yet a twisted agony.</p><p></p><p>The moment their eyes met, a terrifying pressure suddenly bore down upon them.</p><p></p><p>If this had been before his breakthrough to the Extreme Dao Patriarch realm, without cultivating the Nine Levels of True Intent, Gu Qingfeng would have had to temporarily evade this oppressive force.</p><p></p><p>But now, as the evil Buddha's terrifying pressure swept over him, Gu Qingfeng stood tall, his gaze like lightning. The mighty Tyrannical Blade True Intent abruptly slashed out, and the two invisible forces collided in the air, unleashing a dreadful fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>"Awaken!" Gu Qingfeng shouted in a low voice, and the Gu Peng who had fallen into the illusion immediately regained consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the true scene of the Nine Curved Path, the Outer Hall Master's expression also turned grim.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Patriarch... This evil specter's strength has grown even stronger than before!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was grave as he looked towards the ancient city, where the evil Buddha resided. Its bizarre aura shone like a beacon in the darkness of the Nine Curved Path.</p><p></p><p>"Stay close behind me, and do not part with the Demon-Slaying Blade. If necessary, this blade can protect you!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Gu Qingfeng headed towards the ancient city.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Gu Peng replied, immediately following.</p><p></p><p>Delving deeper into the Nine Curved Path, they saw corpses strewn everywhere. This place was like a Asura hell, devoid of any sign of life.</p><p></p><p>This scene made Gu Peng's expression increasingly unsightly, and an indescribable emotion welled up in his heart - panic, fear. For even the bravest of men would find it difficult not to feel afraid upon witnessing such a sight.</p><p></p><p>However, when he saw Gu Qingfeng's back and the Demon-Slaying Blade in his hand, Gu Peng's fear gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, Gu Qingfeng's expression remained calm, as if the scene before him was mere illusion.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they arrived at the gates of the ancient city. In their eyes, the desolate Nine Curved Path had now transformed into a bustling, prosperous city, with people surging like a tide.</p><p></p><p>"Still the same tricks!" Gu Qingfeng shook his head slightly, his expression tinged with disdain. He then unleashed an Eight-Level Sun-Moon True Intent punch towards the ancient city, shattering the air with its force.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The city trembled, and the dust flew. The previous prosperous scene abruptly vanished, revealing the dilapidated city in its true form.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, an angry roar echoed from above the ancient city. The evil Buddha, its eyes filled with wrath, slammed its right palm down towards Gu Qingfeng, its terrifying power distorting and cracking the space, a world-annihilating pressure that struck fear into the heart.</p><p></p><p>"Evil Buddha!" Standing behind Gu Qingfeng, Gu Peng gazed at the descending strike, his entire body trembling under the immense force, his shoulders weighed down as if by a mountain. Escape, let alone resistance, seemed impossible.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

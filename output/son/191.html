        <h1>Chapter 191</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As Gu Qingfeng stepped into the Blood Mountain Manor, the sky and earth before him were still the same, but in his vision, he could see a strange and terrifying ghostly figure standing tall in the heavens.</p><p></p><p>An eerie and cold aura permeated the area, with streams of blood connecting to the ghostly figure - it was truly horrifying.</p><p></p><p>"A formation? A sacrifice?"</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing this sight, Gu Qingfeng's expression remained unchanged, but his eyes grew slightly deeper.</p><p></p><p>The changes in the Blood Mountain Manor were much more severe than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>The strange and terrifying ghostly figure was not the true essence of the evil entity, but merely a manifestation of its power.</p><p></p><p>However, if this evil entity were to awaken...</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng suspected that it would be a being on par with, or even surpassing, the Demonic Buddha of the Nine Turns Dao.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it might be even more powerful than the Demonic Buddha.</p><p></p><p>"According to the information provided by the Divine Martial Sect, the evil entity in the Blood Mountain Manor should be on par with or even weaker than the Demonic Buddha. But now, it seems that the intelligence from the Divine Martial Sect was not entirely accurate.</p><p></p><p>However, this is not a major problem, as the evil entity has not truly awakened yet."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng slowly walked towards the direction of the ghostly figure.</p><p></p><p>As he delved deeper into the Blood Mountain Manor, Gu Qingfeng witnessed the prosperous state of the manor, as if the disasters and calamities in the outside world had no impact on it at all.</p><p></p><p>However, the more he saw this, the colder his expression became.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the realm of the Ultimate Dao Master and breaking through the ninth level of two great Truths, Gu Qingfeng could see through the illusions with his naked eye. The prosperous scene before him might appear normal to others, but in Gu Qingfeng's eyes, he could see piles of white bones and corpses everywhere, turning the entire Blood Mountain Manor into a true hell on earth.</p><p></p><p>A blood sacrifice of an entire manor! Gu Qingfeng suspected that this was either the doing of the Pei family and the Heaven Yang Sword Sect, or the method of the sealed evil entity.</p><p></p><p>However, he soon resolved his doubts.</p><p></p><p>He saw the bodies of more than a dozen people, all wearing the attire of the Heaven Yang Sword Sect. It was clear that these people had come from the Heaven Yang Sword Sect, but their blood had been completely drained, and they had been dead for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Heaven Yang Sword Sect has messed up!"</p><p>"The power of the evil entity in the Blood Mountain Manor is far beyond their expectations."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes grew colder.</p><p></p><p>No wonder there had been no news from the Blood Mountain Manor until now. It appears that this evil entity had been silently slaughtering all the residents of the manor, while also creating an illusion to lure any intruders to become its sustenance.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng entered the Blood Mountain Manor, he had already sensed a force trying to extract his own spiritual essence.</p><p></p><p>However, for him, such a force was completely negligible.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, just from this aspect alone, the evil entity in the Blood Mountain Manor was not an ordinary one.</p><p></p><p>After all, even the Demonic Buddha of the Nine Turns Dao could not achieve the feat of wiping out an entire manor's population and creating an illusion covering the entire manor.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the evil entity in the Blood Mountain Manor was truly formidable.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a sound of breaking the air was heard, and a blood-stained person rushed towards Gu Qingfeng, his face filled with terror, as if something terrifying was chasing him.</p><p></p><p>"Save me, please save me!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Pei Hong's face was filled with terror. When he saw Gu Qingfeng, he hurriedly cried out for help without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>There was an abnormal change in Blood Mountain Manor.</p><p></p><p>He had originally led the Pei family members to enter this place, intending to use their power to integrate the commoners of various cities and perform a blood sacrifice to awaken the evil entity that had been sealed.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, shortly after entering Blood Mountain Manor, Pei Hong discovered that something was amiss. When he truly investigated, he found that all the Pei family warriors who had followed him into Blood Mountain Manor had perished at some unknown time.</p><p></p><p>Countless undead corpses were following him day and night, causing Pei Hong to shudder in horror.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, Pei Hong further discovered that everything visible on the surface of Blood Mountain Manor was an illusion. This great terror made him no longer dare to stay in Blood Mountain Manor.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, once he entered Blood Mountain Manor, even with Pei Hong's innate Zongshi-level strength, it was difficult for him to escape.</p><p></p><p>The moment he unveiled the true nature of Blood Mountain Manor, the many undead corpses revived and surged towards him.</p><p></p><p>And the moment he was injured, Pei Hong felt a mysterious power in the darkness devouring his vital energy. If this continued, it would undoubtedly lead to his death.</p><p></p><p>So, Pei Hong ran.</p><p></p><p>But Blood Mountain Manor was so vast, where could he run to?</p><p></p><p>Just as Pei Hong thought he was going to die here, he saw Gu Qingfeng's figure. Although he was curious as to why there would be someone else in this place given Blood Mountain Manor's current situation, Pei Hong was now desperate and had no choice but to try to seek Gu Qingfeng's help.</p><p></p><p>However, when Pei Hong arrived, Gu Qingfeng asked, "Are you from the Pei family?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Pei Hong paused slightly, then nodded and said, "I am the elder Pei Hong of the Pei family. If you can save me..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, Gu Qingfeng pointed a finger, and Pei Hong's head suddenly exploded into a mist of blood. His headless body collapsed to the ground and quickly turned into a dried corpse.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not hesitate to kill Pei Hong.</p><p></p><p>In fact, as soon as Gu Qingfeng saw the clothes Pei Hong was wearing, he had already more or less confirmed the other party's identity as a member of the Pei family. Asking that question was just to verify it.</p><p></p><p>Pei Hong probably never understood why Gu Qingfeng had to strike him down.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng glanced at Pei Hong's corpse, then looked towards the illusory evil entity in the void. As he made his move, that evil entity's scarlet eyes seemed to be affected as well, projecting a strange whispering voice.</p><p></p><p>"Kneel!"</p><p>"Submit!"</p><p>"I can grant you eternal life..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng disdained these words and looked at the evil entity's illusory form with a cold gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Enough noise!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Gu Qingfeng unleashed a punch, the mighty blood qi energy shattering the heavens and earth. The evil entity let out a furious roar, and then a terrifying power gathered, forming a blood hand that came crashing down.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The two forces collided, and the blood hand suddenly disintegrated. The Great Sun Fist Qi landed on the evil entity, like hot oil meeting cold water, instantly causing it to violently boil. Immediately after, the illusion dissipated like bubbles.</p><p></p><p>The moment the illusion vanished, all the blood lines were severed, and a strange, subtle power spread out, sweeping through the entire Blood Mountain Manor.</p><p></p><p>The previous abnormal scenes had now disappeared, revealing the true reality within.

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Five Viscera Classic (Not yet mastered)!</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Precious Mirror (Not yet mastered)!...</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took a glance at his attribute panel and was surprised to find that two martial arts had been added.</p><p></p><p>These two martial arts were the extraordinary martial arts sent by the Zhuo family.</p><p></p><p>The so-called extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>It is because when ordinary people reach the stage of refining the five viscera, they have already reached the limit of the human body and are stepping towards the extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts involving the refinement of the viscera are also known as extraordinary martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore.</p><p></p><p>Among the two martial arts, Gu Qingfeng also understood that cultivators at the viscera refinement realm are also known as minor grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>The two martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The Five Viscera Classic is a supreme skill that directly targets the refinement of the five viscera.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Precious Mirror, on the other hand, is slightly superior, only targeting the refinement of the four viscera.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>This so-called superiority is relative.</p><p></p><p>In the current situation where high-level martial arts are mostly controlled by sects and aristocratic families, not to mention extraordinary martial arts, even common top-grade martial arts are extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>At least.</p><p></p><p>For many jianghu forces like the Baishi Sect, so far, they only possess mid-grade martial arts that target blood refinement.</p><p></p><p>Obtaining top-grade martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Is no easy task.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for Gu Qingfeng's own advantages, the Gu Family Manor would probably be no different from other small forces, having little opportunity to take the first step.</p><p></p><p>From this, it can be seen.</p><p></p><p>Those ancient aristocratic sects are also secretly suppressing the growth of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>These matters are currently unrelated to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>The two extraordinary martial arts involving viscera refinement can at least serve as the inheritance of the Gu Family Manor, and they don't need to worry about the lack of cultivation methods before reaching the grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng spent several days observing the profundity of the extraordinary supreme skills.</p><p></p><p>Until this moment.</p><p></p><p>He finally truly understood how extraordinary the complete extraordinary martial arts are, and how arduous the refinement of the five viscera can be.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder there are few cultivators in the jianghu who have stepped into the minor grandmaster realm, refining the five viscera is like climbing a steep mountain, a single misstep can lead to death.</p><p></p><p>The path to the extraordinary is indeed not so easy to break through!"</p><p></p><p>Using his advancement points to break through the limit of the Heavenly Gale Divine Body, Gu Qingfeng had successfully entered the first realm of viscera refinement, but he had not yet felt the perilousness of the viscera refinement realm.</p><p></p><p>But now, after obtaining the viscera refinement martial arts and observing their cultivation methods, Gu Qingfeng realized that if there were no guidance from the martial arts of previous generations, the price that later generations would have to pay to create them from scratch would be incalculable.</p><p></p><p>It can be seen from this.</p><p></p><p>The emergence of every martial art is necessarily accompanied by a large number of sacrifices.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise.</p><p></p><p>Such martial arts would not be able to truly emerge.</p><p></p><p>And then.</p><p></p><p>There is the true intention of the grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>In the study.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the grandmaster's true intention painting hanging in the central position, and saw that it was a landscape ink painting, with only a solitary mountain divided into two parts appearing in the picture.</p><p></p><p>Apart from this.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing else.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the grandmaster's true intention painting, Gu Qingfeng understood that this painting was not simple at all.</p><p></p><p>The painting seemed to contain an extremely profound aura.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately.</p><p></p><p>The profundity of this painting.</p><p></p><p>Even though Gu Qingfeng observed it, he did not gain much harvest for the time being.</p><p></p><p>"According to Zhuo Feng's words, this contains the true intention of a grandmaster who is about to break through to the great grandmaster realm. The people of the Zhuo family have had this grandmaster's true intention painting for many years, but they have not been able to comprehend its profundity.</p><p></p><p>This shows that to unravel the profundity of the grandmaster's true intention painting is by no means a simple matter."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>He was not discouraged.</p><p></p><p>Just because he could not comprehend it now does not mean he cannot comprehend it in the future.</p><p></p><p>As long as he continues to ponder it, Gu Qingfeng believes that he will eventually be able to unravel its profundity.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The day came when one could fathom the profound mysteries hidden within the Grand Master's true intent.</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has slightly improved in his innate talent!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has slightly improved in his innate talent!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has gained some understanding of the Grand Master's true intent!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the time that followed, Gu Qingfeng silently cultivated the Qingyang Technique and the Five Viscera Classic. The former could refine his pure yang qi and blood, while the latter could help him break through the Refining Viscera realm.</p><p></p><p>Since the Zhuo family's departure, the Gu family manor had regained its former tranquility.</p><p></p><p>During his free time after cultivation, Gu Qingfeng would occasionally check the changes on the information panel.</p><p></p><p>There would be some information refreshed every now and then, but the changes were not significant.</p><p></p><p>However, </p><p></p><p>on this particular day,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression changed slightly when he saw the refreshed information.</p><p></p><p>"Yang'er has gained some understanding of the Grand Master's true intent?"</p><p></p><p>Since the Grand Master's true intent had been hung in the study, Gu Yang had also come to know that it was a precious treasure left behind by the Grand Master, containing a fragment of the Grand Master's true intent.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not hinder Gu Yang from observing the Grand Master's true intent.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Qingfeng himself had possessed the Grand Master's true intent for some time, but had never been able to comprehend it. If Gu Yang wanted to ponder it, then let him do so.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Qingfeng's view,</p><p></p><p>if he himself could not fathom it, then Gu Yang most likely would not have any results either.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had gained some harvest so quickly.</p><p></p><p>For this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was delighted in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although he himself had not grasped the profundity of the Grand Master's true intent, if Gu Yang could comprehend it, that would also be good.</p><p></p><p>In the days that followed,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not disturb Gu Yang's contemplation, nor did he inquire about anything related to the Grand Master's true intent.</p><p></p><p>Matters of true intent required personal enlightenment and could not be expressed in words.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has gained some understanding of the Grand Master's true intent!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has deepened his understanding of the Grand Master's true intent!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has deepened his understanding of the Grand Master's true intent!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has comprehended the Grand Master's supreme technique 'Tyrannical Blade Slash' from the Grand Master's true intent!"</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>"Tyrannical Blade Slash!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>From the time Gu Yang began to ponder the Grand Master's true intent until now, about a month had passed, and the information panel had refreshed every now and then, informing him of Gu Yang's progress.</p><p></p><p>Now,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had finally grasped a supreme technique of the Grand Master from the Grand Master's true intent.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>a powerful aura of the Dao of the Blade erupted from the study, a domineering and unparalleled presence sweeping across the area, causing Gu Qingfeng's expression to become involuntarily grave.</p><p></p><p>Under the cover of this Blade Dao, all the people in the Gu family manor felt a mysterious chill, as if they had been targeted by a terrifying existence.</p><p></p><p>But this Blade Dao came and went quickly.</p><p></p><p>When the sensation faded, everyone was left somewhat bewildered.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>In the main hall,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sat in the main seat.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang walked in from outside.</p><p></p><p>Compared to before, there seemed to be a different aura about him now, and there was a domineering and fierce presence in his brows and eyes.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Yang concealed it well, he could not escape Gu Qingfeng's observation.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Gu family's prodigy before him, Gu Qingfeng said, "You have comprehended that Grand Master's true intent, haven't you?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

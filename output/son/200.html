            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He was well aware that the imperial house of the Ji family had accumulated profound heritage over thousands of years, but he didn't expect them to have such profound resources.</p><p></p><p>Five grand patriarchs! This was an incredible concept.</p><p></p><p>Over the millennia, the true grand patriarchs who had appeared openly in the Nine Provinces were not many.</p><p></p><p>Now, the imperial house of the Ji family possessed five grand patriarchs, which showed the terrifying depth of their resources.</p><p></p><p>But upon further reflection, Gu Qingfeng felt that this was normal.</p><p></p><p>After all, the imperial house of the Ji family controlled the Nine Provinces. Even if there were immortal ancient families eyeing them hungrily, it was not entirely impossible for them to divert some resources to cultivate a few grand patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>"However, relying solely on these five grand patriarchs, it won't be that simple to change the current situation!" Gu Qingfeng mused.</p><p></p><p>The five grand patriarchs were indeed formidable, but now many immortal sects and ancient families were all eyeing the Nine Provinces. The possibility of this force, relying on the five grand patriarchs, successfully reversing the declining trend was not high.</p><p></p><p>However, the situation had reached this point.</p><p></p><p>The imperial house of the Ji family had no retreat.</p><p></p><p>If they did not expose their final trump card, the Ji family might be completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, regardless of the facts, these five grand patriarchs could not be hidden.</p><p></p><p>"Continue to keep an eye on the affairs in the Central Plains, and report any changes to me immediately!" Gu Qingfeng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The hidden guard immediately acknowledged the order and withdrew.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the five grand patriarchs would inevitably push the situation in the Central Plains to a climax.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Qingfeng's view, the chaotic battle in the Central Plains would not take long to be completely resolved.</p><p></p><p>The only question was who would be the final winner.</p><p></p><p>But regardless, the imperial house of the Ji family was most likely not going to be that winner.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, the five grand patriarchs were indeed not weak.</p><p></p><p>But which of these immortal sects did not have profound resources?</p><p></p><p>Relying on the five grand patriarchs to block these ancient families was nothing but a joke.</p><p></p><p>Unless...</p><p></p><p>The imperial house of the Ji family had even more powerful resources, then it would be a different story.</p><p></p><p>However, in Gu Qingfeng's view, the current situation in the Central Plains also had some benefits.</p><p></p><p>After all, the imperial house of the Ji family had exposed such a trump card, which would inevitably attract the attention of all parties again, making Gu Yang's actions much easier.</p><p></p><p>Until they controlled the Qingyun State, they would have the qualifications to truly compete for the world.</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Gu Qingfeng continued his closed-door cultivation.</p><p></p><p>For him, there was nothing more important than improving his own strength at the moment.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>"The five grand patriarchs of the imperial house of the Ji family, no wonder the Taixuan Dynasty was able to dominate the world for three thousand years, this kind of depth is probably beyond even the Ji family's own expectations!" </p><p></p><p>In the Southern Yang Commandery, when Ancient Cloud learned of this news, his expression was also filled with deep sighs.</p><p></p><p>As the top sect left behind by the Martial Ancestor, the Shenwu Sect currently did not have a single grand patriarch in existence.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the imperial house of the Ji family, they could produce five grand patriarchs at once.</p><p></p><p>From this, it was clear that the Shenwu Sect had indeed fallen into serious decline.</p><p></p><p>But this was an unavoidable situation.</p><p></p><p>Nominally the hegemon of the Wuzhou, but in the current world where Taoists were revered, the Shenwu Sect actually had little say in Wuzhou.</p><p></p><p>So the foundation of the Shenwu Sect could not be compared to the imperial house of the Ji family.</p><p></p><p>However, upon truly learning that the imperial house of the Ji family could produce five grand patriarchs, Ancient Cloud's heart could not help but be shaken.</p><p></p><p>As a swordsman who had already broken through to the grand patriarch realm, he was also slightly moved at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Five grand patriarchs, if I could fight them, it would be a wonderful thing!"</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the grand patriarch realm, the swordsman also wanted to have a battle with other grand patriarchs to test his own strength.</p><p></p><p>However, the swordsman was also aware that if he really went to the Central Plains, he might be suppressed by other immortal sects and ancient families before he even had the chance to fight the grand patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>So, this was just a thought for the swordsman.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Cloud smiled and said, "Senior Swordsman's cultivation is profound, having already reached the grand patriarch realm, you should be ranked among the top experts in the world, not inferior to the grand patriarchs of the Ji family.</p><p></p><p>And now the King wishes to compete for the world, in the future there will surely be many strong figures to obstruct him, so Senior need not worry about lacking opponents!"</p><p></p><p>Regarding this veteran expert, the swordsman, Ancient Cloud addressed him as a junior.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that the swordsman was already a grand patriarch, while Ancient Cloud himself was only a half-step grand patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Just in terms of age alone, the swordsman was much older than Ancient Cloud, so the latter had to show him proper respect.</p><p></p><p>"Ancient Sect Master's foundation is deep, in my opinion, you should be able to break through to the grand patriarch realm in not too long." </p><p></p><p>Hearing Ancient Cloud's words, the swordsman looked at him and smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Cloud shook his head: "To break through to the grand patriarch realm, how easy is that!"</p><p></p><p>Although he was already a half-step grand patriarch, with only half a step left to the true grand patriarch realm, this half-step could still block him for the rest of his life if he was unlucky.</p><p></p><p>Throughout history, many brilliant experts had been stuck at the half-step grand patriarch realm, never able to take that final step and attain the grand patriarch realm.</p><p></p><p>This was also one of the reasons why many experts in their later years chose to cultivate demonic arts.</p><p></p><p>Martial Dao</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hopeless.</p><p></p><p>There was no choice but to settle for second best.</p><p></p><p>Like the swordsman, those who truly have a heart for the martial way are few and far between. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the words of the few below, as well as understanding the current situation in the Central Plains, Gu Yang immediately spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"The five grand masters of the Imperial House of Ji have emerged, and the eyes of the world will surely converge on the Central Plains. At present, my Guangyang army has already conquered the Taishan and Nanyang prefectures. I believe that we should seize this opportunity to also take the Chiang and Danyang prefectures, completely controlling the Qingyun State."</p><p></p><p>Among the Nine States of the world, </p><p>the Guangyang army must at least control one state to have the qualifications to contend for the Heavenly Throne.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary people to control a state is not that simple.</p><p></p><p>But in Gu Yang's view, taking over the Qingyun State would not be too difficult.</p><p></p><p>First, the Divine Martial Sect has defected to his side.</p><p>Later, the Iron Sword Sect has also submitted.</p><p></p><p>In terms of reputation and foundation, the Iron Sword Sect cannot be compared to the Divine Martial Sect, but the fact that the Iron Sword Sect has produced a grand martial master like the Swordsman means it cannot be judged by ordinary standards.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the submission of the Nanyang prefecture and the defection of the Iron Sword Sect, the open declaration of a grand martial master joining Gu Yang's banner has also caused an uproar in the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>At this time, </p><p>many jianghu warriors have flocked to join him.</p><p></p><p>In this way, </p><p>Gu Yang's forces have become even more formidable.</p><p></p><p>With such strength, taking over the Qingyun State would be easy.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Zhen, you will be the commander-in-chief this time. I will give you 800,000 troops and five pre-celestial realm masters to attack the Danyang prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>"Your subordinate will not disappoint Your Majesty's high expectations!" </p><p></p><p>Shi Zhen's expression brightened, and he immediately clasped his fists and accepted the order.</p><p></p><p>As the commander-in-chief leading an army, attacking the Danyang prefecture, he naturally understood the magnitude of this opportunity. </p><p></p><p>If he could conquer the Danyang prefecture, it would undoubtedly be a great achievement.</p><p></p><p>Although the Danyang prefecture is not weak, Shi Zhen is also quite confident about it.</p><p></p><p>With 800,000 troops, </p><p>and him having broken through the limits of refinement to reach the realm of a master, </p><p>plus the assistance of five pre-celestial realm masters, conquering the Danyang prefecture would naturally not be a big problem.</p><p></p><p>After all, the foundation of the Danyang prefecture is different from that of the Nanyang prefecture. </p><p></p><p>The latter has the immortal Tianyang Sword Sect as its pillar, while the former's foundation is not that strong.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, </p><p>with the Guangyang army having conquered two prefectures and built a fearsome reputation, even if the Danyang prefecture has some foundation, they may not dare to confront the Guangyang army head-on.</p><p></p><p>The other commanders looked at Shi Zhen with envious eyes. </p><p>This great achievement was something they all coveted.</p><p></p><p>Noticing the gazes of the others, Gu Yang paused for a moment, his gaze falling on Jiang Mo.</p><p></p><p>"For the attack on the Chiang prefecture, Jiang Mo, you will be the commander-in-chief, and Xue Cheng will be the deputy commander. I will also give you 800,000 troops and five masters to lead the expedition."</p><p></p><p>"The only requirement I have for this battle is to conquer the Chiang prefecture as quickly as possible and with the lowest casualties!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Both Jiang Mo and Xue Cheng clasped their fists and saluted, their expressions filled with excitement. </p><p></p><p>Especially Xue Cheng. </p><p>Although he was the deputy commander, the fact that he, a former imperial defector, was given such an important role was already more than enough in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>After appointing the two army commanders, Gu Yang issued other orders. His only goal was to conquer the two prefectures and completely control the Qingyun State.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>In the Central Plains, </p><p>outside the capital city, </p><p>the armies were besieging the city. </p><p>The flames of war spread in all directions, and countless soldiers perished.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The fierce blade qi, as if able to cleave the heavens and the earth, fell down, and hundreds or even thousands of soldiers' bodies burst open, turning into a bloody mist without even a single scream before dying on the spot.</p><p></p><p>This scene </p><p>caused the others to change their expressions drastically.</p><p></p><p>On the city wall, </p><p>a young man in white robes floated there, like a peerless killing god descended into the world, his brows and eyes filled with an indifferent coldness, a disregard for life.</p><p></p><p>"Whoever dares to approach the capital even half a step, this will be their fate!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, </p><p>the enemy's assault on the city did not slow down in the least.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, </p><p>the young man in white robes coldened his expression, and his long sword swung out, instantly unleashing hundreds of blade lights that slaughtered countless enemy soldiers on the spot, with blood and severed limbs flying everywhere, a horrifying scene.</p><p></p><p>Just then, </p><p>an angry voice resounded.</p><p></p><p>"Ji Shen Dao, as a grand master of the true meaning, what is there to be proud of in attacking ordinary people? Let me come and meet you!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, </p><p>the void trembled. </p><p>A terrifying, icy aura erupted, shaking the heavens and the earth, and a hand formed from spiritual power suddenly pressed down towards the young man in white robes.</p><p></p><p>"Huang Zhou Li Family!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shen Dao's eyes turned cold, and a torrential true qi surged into his long sword, followed by a shocking blade intent that tore through the heavens, fiercely slashing down at that hand.</p><p></p><p>This strike, </p><p>cleaved the heavens and the earth, </p><p>as if able to divide rivers and streams.</p><p></p><p>The hand formed from spiritual power was completely shattered under this strike, and at the same time, a middle-aged man was pushed back from the void, his gaze towards Ji Shen Dao filled with solemnity.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder you are the most outstanding genius of the Ji Family Imperial House from six hundred years ago, your strength is truly extraordinary!"(Chapter end)</p>

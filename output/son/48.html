        <h1>Chapter 48</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Shi looked at the Gu family mansion in front of him, a trace of disdain flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he planned to directly barge in.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a Gu family guard stretched out his hand to block him.</p><p></p><p>"Stop right there, this is the Gu family, you are not allowed to intrude—"</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, the guard had already been flung out, crashing heavily through the main gate, with a large mouthful of blood almost spurting out, and it seemed he was taking in more air than he was exhaling.</p><p></p><p>The sudden change of events had shaken the entire Gu family.</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng led a group of guards to come forward, and when he saw the corpse on the ground and the broken gate, a cold light flashed in his eyes, and he glanced at Ye Shi, finally fixing his gaze on the elegantly dressed elder.</p><p></p><p>"You have intruded into our Gu family without reason, and even killed our Gu family guard, can you give an explanation for this!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng said coldly.</p><p></p><p>He did not rashly make a move.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Gu family was now famous, and in such a situation, someone still dared to cause trouble at the Gu family, their identity and background must not be simple.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in Meng Peng's eyes, the elegantly dressed elder in front of him was just like an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>In this case, there could only be two possibilities:</p><p></p><p>The first was that he was truly an ordinary person, and the second was that his cultivation was unfathomable, far beyond Meng Peng's comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Between the two, Meng Peng was inclined to the latter.</p><p></p><p>After all, those two young men and women were already at the Blood Refining Realm, and the leader, the elegantly dressed elder, must have strength that was not simple.</p><p></p><p>As Meng Peng's words fell, the elegantly dressed elder did not speak, but Ye Shi took the lead, saying arrogantly:</p><p></p><p>"This is our Qingyang Sect's Elder Xue Wang, I am a direct disciple of the Qingyang Sect. Not only did we kill one of your Gu family guards, even if we were to wipe out your entire Gu family, who would dare to say a word against it?"</p><p></p><p>These words caused the Gu family guards and Meng Peng to change their expressions.</p><p></p><p>Qingyang Sect! These three words were like thunderous echoes in Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>It was not that the White Stone Dao did not have many experts, but in the face of the Qingyang Sect, they were simply insignificant.</p><p></p><p>Before Meng Peng could speak, a cold and proud voice was heard:</p><p></p><p>"Such a big mouth, this young master wants to see who dares to spout such nonsense in my Gu family!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Gu Yang slowly walked over, and seeing the dead guard on the ground, his face grew even colder.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Yang appeared, the silent Yin Lu's eyes brightened, and the handsome features of the former involuntarily stirred some ripples in her heart.</p><p></p><p>This scene was seen by Ye Shi, and his heart was immediately filled with jealousy, his face becoming ferocious.</p><p></p><p>"Little Gu family young master, you dare to be disrespectful to our Qingyang Sect, you are simply courting death—"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, Ye Shi instantly struck, his fierce force breaking through the air and rushing towards Gu Yang, his attack swift as lightning, the murderous intent on his face clear, obviously intending to take Gu Yang's life.</p><p></p><p>The latter was unafraid, his flesh and blood vibrating, and the Gu family's fist technique that had reached the Transformation Realm was unleashed, the surging power converging, and with each punch, the force was as mighty as a collapsing mountain.</p><p></p><p>The two of them exchanged dozens of blows in less than a breath.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Shi's previous arrogance had disappeared, and he was filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that the little Gu family young master's strength would be no match for his own, and that if he struck, he could instantly crush the other. But when they truly clashed, he was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The clash made Ye Shi realize how naive he had been.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's strength was not only powerful, but terrifyingly so.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they faced off,</p><p></p><p>Ye Shi was already at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>Just as Ye Shi was about to retreat, Gu Yang's fierce offensive made him unable to defend, a punch shaking off his arms, and a palm strike directly hitting his vital point.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Xue, save me--"</p><p></p><p>Ye Shi's soul was greatly alarmed, no longer caring about face or no face, desperately calling for help in terror.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the previously motionless Xue Wang, with eyes like a hawk, flashed a cold glint, his right hand striking out like lightning, the five fingers like eagle claws descending towards Gu Yang's forehead.</p><p></p><p>This strike,</p><p></p><p>made Gu Yang feel a tremendous threat, forcing him to defend.</p><p></p><p>However--</p><p></p><p>Before the strike could truly land, Xue Wang's palm stopped in mid-air, and Gu Qingfeng, who knew not when he appeared, had grasped Gu Yang's wrist with his right hand, preventing it from falling.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng expelled force from his palm, causing Xue Wang's body to tremble and retreat several steps before finally stopping.</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang lowered his head, his expression somewhat ashamed.</p><p></p><p>Just now, if it weren't for Gu Qingfeng's intervention, he might have perished at Xue Wang's hands.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng waved his hand, his expression calm: "You may withdraw first, I will handle the matters here."</p><p></p><p>On the other side,</p><p></p><p>Ye Shi and Song Lan's expressions also changed, their gazes towards Gu Qingfeng filled with a sense of awe.</p><p></p><p>Xue Wang was an elder of the Qingyang Sect, his strength rivaling that of the Refining Blood Realm, but the person before them, able to repel Xue Wang, clearly had extraordinary abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Refining Bone Realm - I never expected the esteemed Gu Family Master to be a Refining Bone Realm expert, no wonder he was able to unify the entire Baishi Dao, no wonder he dares to not take our Qingyang Sect seriously!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Wang's expression turned slightly gloomy, his eyes filled with coldness.</p><p></p><p>"However, if the Gu Family Master thinks that with just the strength of the Refining Bone Realm, he can ignore our Qingyang Sect, then he has underestimated our Qingyang Sect far too much!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled gently, politely cupping his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Gu has never dared to look down on the Qingyang Sect, the earlier action was only due to urgency, I have not yet asked for your honored name, what position do you hold in the Qingyang Sect, and what matter has brought you here today?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Qingfeng's courteous words, Xue Wang's expression finally eased somewhat, then he snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I am Xue Wang, the current elder of the Qingyang Sect. Today, I have come because the Qingyang Sect has a matter that requires the Gu Family to handle. As long as it is done well, the Qingyang Sect will have a reward. If it is not done well, the consequences may be more than the Gu Family can bear."</p><p></p><p>Xue Wang stood with his hands behind his back, his gaze towards Gu Qingfeng full of superiority.</p><p></p><p>Hearing his words, Gu Yang's expression became furious, but Gu Qingfeng's expression remained calm, his smile still lingering.</p><p></p><p>"It is an honor for the Gu Family to be of service to the Qingyang Sect. The reputation of the Qingyang Sect has long been known to Gu, but I wonder if the Qingyang Sect currently has any Washing Marrow Realm experts in its ranks?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, do you know what the Washing Marrow Realm is? Looking at the entire Taishan Prefecture, the experts who can enter the Washing Marrow Realm are not many."</p><p></p><p>Xue Wang sneered, his expression mocking, then his expression became haughty again.</p><p></p><p>"Although our Qingyang Sect does not have a Washing Marrow Realm expert, our Sect Master reached the Gold Bone Realm Perfection some years ago, breaking through to the Washing Marrow Realm is only a matter of time."</p><p></p><p>"I see!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly, but his smile suddenly disappeared, and in the next moment, he appeared in front of Xue Wang, his five fingers grasping the other's forehead, slamming him down towards the ground.</p><p></p><p>"You don't even have the Washing Marrow Realm, and you're still putting on airs?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

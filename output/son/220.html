        <h1>Chapter 220</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The ancient saying goes that one should act with reverence and respect. The gaze directed towards Gu Qingfeng was filled with awe and trepidation.</p><p></p><p>If just a few days ago, Gu Qingfeng had only given Gu Yun a strong sense of oppression, then the current Gu Qingfeng was unfathomable, like an unfathomable abyss.</p><p></p><p>Even though the other party was just standing there, Gu Yun felt an impulse to kneel and submit.</p><p></p><p>As for this...</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun's inner heart grew increasingly in awe.</p><p></p><p>In front of others, he was the lofty grand master of the martial dao, but in front of Gu Qingfeng, he was just a junior disciple.</p><p></p><p>"The inheritance left behind by the Martial Ancestor, I have already obtained it. However, that inheritance involves a lot of cause and effect. If your cultivation is not sufficient, you should not rashly expose it for the time being," Gu Qingfeng said.</p><p></p><p>After speaking, his divine sense moved, and a mighty stream of information directly surged into Gu Yun's mind.</p><p></p><p>Open the Dao Palace. Condense the Primordial Spirit. Gu Qingfeng's transmission of the cultivation method was also relatively simple.</p><p></p><p>With just a thought, he completely imparted all the knowledge related to the Divine Yang Classic to Gu Yun.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Gu Qingfeng also passed on some information related to the Divine Yang Sacred Land and other matters to Gu Yun, but he did not transmit the Saint's inheritance to the other party.</p><p></p><p>The influx of vast information, and this time Gu Yun took longer to digest it compared to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Gu Yun opened his eyes, and a sense of being in a different world surged from his heart, but it soon recovered.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Yang Sacred Land!"</p><p>"The Divine Yang Classic!"</p><p>"The Saint's inheritance--"</p><p></p><p>The vast amount of information made Gu Yun's heart tremble for a long time.</p><p></p><p>It was only now that he truly understood how vast the heavens and earth were.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that the Nine Provinces were already vast, but now he realized that the Nine Provinces were just a corner of the Primordial Realm.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the profundity of the Divine Yang Classic made Gu Yun feel that his horizons had been greatly expanded. Compared to the Divine Yang Classic, the inheritance of the Divine Martial Sect that he had cultivated before was like the difference between a firefly and the bright moon.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "The Saint's inheritance is of great importance. Even if you have now obtained such an inheritance, it would not be of much benefit to you. </p><p></p><p>When the day comes that you can enter the Dao Palace Realm, you can then come seek me, and I will then pass on the Saint's inheritance left behind by Murong Xiu!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yun hurriedly said, "Master Gu, the fact that you can pass down the Divine Yang Classic is already extremely satisfactory to me. I would never dare to hope for the Saint's inheritance!"</p><p></p><p>This was not Gu Yun pretending to be humble.</p><p></p><p>It was because the vast Divine Yang Sacred Land was destroyed due to the Saint's inheritance, and the mighty Martial Ancestor had to come to the Nine Provinces to hide, and even suffered heavy injuries. An existence that originally had the hope of stepping into the Dao Palace Realm eventually died in gloom.</p><p></p><p>This showed that while the Saint's inheritance was good, one must have sufficient strength to master it. Without the matching strength, to rashly seek such an inheritance would only bring disaster upon oneself.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun was able to understand this clearly.</p><p></p><p>There was also another point, which was that Gu Qingfeng had obtained the Divine Yang Classic and could have chosen not to pass it on to him, or even directly erase the existence of the Saint's inheritance, but he truthfully informed Gu Yun, for which Gu Yun was extremely grateful.</p><p></p><p>Now that he could obtain the Divine Yang Classic, he was already very satisfied, and he had no further expectations.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Martial Sect was originally established by Murong Xiu, which can be considered a continuation of the Divine Yang Sacred Land. The Divine Yang Classic should have been the inheritance of your Divine Martial Sect. I am passing it on to you as it is appropriate.</p><p></p><p>The Saint's inheritance also belongs to Murong Xiu's legacy, and is also part of the inheritance of the Divine Martial Sect. However, such an inheritance is not something ordinary cultivators can master. Passing it on to you now would only harm you."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, the Divine Yang Sacred Land is of great importance. Regarding the Divine Yang Classic, if your cultivation is not enough, I suggest you do not rashly reveal it.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Nine Provinces belong to the Primordial Realm, and who can guarantee that there are no other powerful figures from the Primordial Realm here?</p><p></p><p>This matter involves the Saint's inheritance. If it is leaked out, it may bring a catastrophe upon the Divine Martial Sect!"</p><p></p><p>In the end, Gu Qingfeng warned again.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun solemnly nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I understand what Master Gu has said!"</p><p></p><p>"In that case, it's good."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stayed in the Divine Martial Sect for another day, and then left.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun wanted to persuade him to stay, but was rejected by Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, he did not force the matter further.</p><p></p><p>This time, with Gu Qingfeng's guidance, Gu Yun successfully stepped into the realm of the Grand Martial Master, and was also granted the Great Desolation Fist Classic and the Divine Yang Classic. Gu Yun needed time to digest these things.</p><p></p><p>But one thing was clear to Gu Yun.</p><p></p><p>That was, the Divine Martial Sect was about to usher in a prosperous era.</p><p></p><p>The Great Desolation Fist Classic was an unparalleled supreme technique at the Divine Transformation Realm, and the Divine Yang Classic was the pinnacle inheritance of the Dao Palace Realm! These two treasures, as long as there were no accidents, would be enough to make the Divine Martial Sect the top third force in the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>The first would naturally be the Gu Family Manor where Gu Qingfeng resided, and the second would be the current Divine Martial Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>This was already enough.</p><p></p><p>Ten years ago, the Divine Martial Sect only had the name of the number one sect in the world, but it was on the verge of collapse at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Ten years later, the Divine Martial Sect now had a solid foundation.</p><p></p><p>Even now, if they were to face other immortal sects and families, Gu Yun would not be the least bit afraid.</p><p></p><p>The so-called evil spirits do not die, it was just because the martial dao in the Nine Provinces was too weak before.</p><p></p><p>With the Divine Yang Classic, one could cultivate the truly supreme inheritance, and even the evil spirits could be subdued.</p><p></p><p>In less than two days, Gu Qingfeng had returned to the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>When a cultivator stepped into the Divine Transformation Realm, they would be able to truly fly freely. And when they entered the Dao Palace Realm, their speed would be even more astonishing.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Manor Lord!" </p><p></p><p>As soon as Gu Qingfeng returned to the Gu Family Manor, Gu Peng immediately came to pay his respects.</p><p></p><p>The current Gu Peng had already taken the Grand Master Promotion Pill, and his cultivation had broken through to the peak of the Grand Master realm, with the hope of breaking through to the Divine Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, in the current situation where the martial dao inheritances in the Nine Provinces were incomplete, the probability of truly breaking through to the Divine Transformation Realm was extremely low.</p><p></p><p>The most likely outcome was that he would be stuck at the peak of the Grand Master realm until the end of his lifespan.</p><p></p><p>"Has anything happened during this period?" Gu Qingfeng asked.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng shook his head, "Everything is fine now."</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm," Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly, looking at Gu Peng for a while. His divine sense then moved again, and a surging divine sense power gushed into Gu Peng's mind, causing the latter to be dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Gu Peng finally truly regained his senses.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Yang Classic..."</p><p></p><p>His expression was filled with shock, disbelief, and amazement.</p><p></p><p>The information in his mind was about a supreme martial art called the Divine Yang Classic. This martial art was profoundly mysterious and directly targeted the realm beyond the Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>It was only now that Gu Peng realized that beyond the Grand Master realm was a realm known as the Divine Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "I have passed the Divine Yang Classic to you. You can cultivate this technique. Perhaps one day you will be able to break through the limit of the Grand Master and enter the Divine Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>But there is one thing you must remember - the matter of the Divine Yang Classic must not be leaked out. Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>At these words, Gu Peng's body trembled, and he immediately became fully alert. Hearing Gu Qingfeng's words, he hurriedly bowed down.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, even if I die, I will not reveal a single word of this!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, you may withdraw now," Gu Qingfeng waved his hand, letting Gu Peng leave.</p><p></p><p>The fundamental reason why Gu Qingfeng passed on the Divine Yang Classic to him was because Gu Peng had already reached the peak of the Grand Master realm, and he hoped that the other party could advance even further.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Gu Qingfeng did not pass on the complete Divine Yang Classic to him, but only the cultivation method up to the first layer of the Divine Transformation Realm and before.</p><p></p><p>As for the later parts, Gu Qingfeng did not transmit them for the time being.</p><p></p><p>After all, whether Gu Peng could break through the Divine Transformation Realm was still a question, and as for the later parts, that was too distant.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Gu Family Manor, Gu Qingfeng looked at the information panel, his expression slightly changing.</p><p></p><p>When he saw that Gu Yang had obtained the inheritance of a Divine Transformation Realm expert, he also had some fluctuations in his heart.</p><p></p><p>When he learned that the Nine Provinces was a part of the Primordial Realm, Gu Qingfeng had already thought that there might be Divine Transformation Realm experts who had set foot in the Nine Provinces, and the extraordinary nature of the Forged Immortal Pavilion could also explain many things.</p><p></p><p>It was just speculation before, but now that he actually saw Gu Yang obtaining the inheritance of a Divine Transformation Realm expert, he couldn't help but feel somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>The inheritance of the Divine Transformation Realm! If Gu Qingfeng had not gone to the Divine Martial Sect this time, he might not have had the chance to obtain this level of opportunity.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Yang could obtain opportunities from time to time, which showed that his auspicious fate was extremely strong.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Gu Qingfeng wanted to find an opportunity to pass the Divine Yang Classic to Gu Yang, but now it seems that the other party also had his own opportunities.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>When he saw the information regarding Gu Xuan, Gu Qingfeng's expression became completely gloomy.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he could determine that Gu Xuan must have entered the Ancient Beast Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, there would not be such frequent attacks by fierce beasts.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the Ancient Beast Mountain Range was so dangerous was because...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fang was not only connected to the Nine States, but also connected to other places in the Primordial Realm.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Beast Mountain Range is actually a barrier for the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely because of the existence of the Ancient Beast Mountain Range that it can indirectly isolate other places in the Primordial Realm from the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>This information.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng naturally learned it from Mu Rongxiu.</p><p></p><p>The reason why he crossed the Ancient Beast Mountain Range was, after all, to rely on the perilousness of the Ancient Beast Mountain Range to block those who were chasing after him.</p><p></p><p>In other words.</p><p></p><p>The danger within the Ancient Beast Mountain Range is such that even experts at the Divine Transformation Realm or even the Dao Palace Realm may have the possibility of perishing within it.</p><p></p><p>"Based on the information left behind by Mu Rongxiu, the Ancient Beast Mountain Range is one of the oldest mountain ranges in the Primordial Realm, and is also one of the many dangerous places in the Primordial Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, there may even exist ferocious beasts that are comparable to the Divine Transformation Realm and the Dao Palace Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng recalled the information Mu Rongxiu had left behind about the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, and it was precisely because he understood the danger of the Ancient Beast Mountain Range that he knew how great the risk of entering it would be.</p><p></p><p>However, when he saw that the mysterious expert had taken Gu Xuan as his disciple, Gu Qingfeng's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>A mysterious expert? A mysterious expert who appeared in the Ancient Beast Mountain Range? "Could it be a cultivator from outside the Nine States?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered.</p><p></p><p>After all, if it were a cultivator from the Nine States, it would basically be impossible for them to set foot in the Ancient Beast Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>The long-unseen Red Leaf arrived gracefully.</p><p></p><p>Seeing her arrival, Gu Qingfeng frowned: "You're injured?"</p><p></p><p>The Red Leaf in front of him did not appear to have any visible injuries, but her aura was slightly chaotic, and there was a faint scent of blood.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Qingfeng's current cultivation, he could not hide the fact that she was injured from his observation.</p><p></p><p>"Your subordinate has failed in the important task entrusted by the master!"</p><p></p><p>Red Leaf was filled with shame, and a faint pallor could be seen on her beautiful, cold face.</p><p></p><p>"With your current Grand Master's strength, the only place in the Nine States that can injure you is the Ancient Beast Mountain Range. You've entered the Ancient Beast Mountain Range?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng quickly understood many things with just a brief thought.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Red Leaf bitterly smiled: "The master ordered me to contact Duopo and search for the whereabouts of the Second Young Master, but according to the news from the secret guards, the Second Young Master was chasing after a cultivator who practiced evil techniques and had entered the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, and Duopo also followed him in."</p><p></p><p>"Upon receiving this news, I naturally entered the Ancient Beast Mountain Range to search for their whereabouts."</p><p></p><p>"Later, I found Duopo's hidden mark in the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, and finally found the severely injured and unconscious Duopo in a cave, but I did not see any trace of the Second Young Master.</p><p></p><p>I wanted to take Duopo out of the Ancient Beast Mountain Range first, but was attacked by a ferocious beast when leaving, and I was unable to defeat it, so I was injured!"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Red Leaf's brows were tightly knitted, and there was deep dread in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>With her status as a top-tier Grand Master who had comprehended the Ninth-Level True Meaning, she was still defeated by a ferocious beast and almost couldn't make it out of the Ancient Beast Mountain Range alive.</p><p></p><p>This level of ferocious beast was something Red Leaf had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>She had already heard about the dangers of the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, but it was only now that she truly experienced it.</p><p></p><p>"How is Duopo's injury? "</p><p></p><p>"The secret guards are treating him, and for now there is no major problem, but he is still unconscious."</p><p></p><p>"Treat him with full effort, and also have the secret guards hand over all the information related to when Xuan entered the Ancient Beast Mountain Range to me!"</p><p></p><p>As Gu Qingfeng said this, he glanced at the dejected Red Leaf.</p><p></p><p>"You should also go and rest."</p><p></p><p>"I will take my leave."</p><p></p><p>Red Leaf bowed and left.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A day later.</p><p></p><p>All the information regarding Gu Xuan had appeared in Gu Qingfeng's hands, and Duopo had also woken up and revealed all the information he knew.</p><p></p><p>The story was simple.</p><p></p><p>It was nothing more than Gu Xuan chasing after a cultivator who practiced evil techniques into the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, and Duopo closely followed him in, only to see Gu Xuan being attacked by a ferocious beast, so he stepped in to block it and create an opportunity for the former to escape.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Duopo was defeated by the ferocious beast and severely injured and fell unconscious.</p><p></p><p>As for Gu Xuan, he was obviously trapped in the Ancient Beast Mountain Range and then a series of events occurred.</p><p></p><p>After clarifying the ins and outs.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not hesitate and directly headed to the Ancient Beast Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stepped into this dangerous place that made the cultivators of the Nine States shudder.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered the Ancient Beast Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>He saw towering trees.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had entered a primeval forest, completely isolated from the world, and the spiritual energy of heaven and earth was also much more concentrated, completely incomparable to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Ancient Beast Mountain Range can nurture many powerful ferocious beasts, with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth here, it is not surprising that some powerful beings can be born!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression remained calm, and his divine sense also spread out, covering an area of tens of miles.</p><p></p><p>Within his divine sense, there were ferocious beasts fighting, breaking countless trees, and the ground was stained with a large amount of fresh blood, accompanied by roars and growls.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took a step forward, and his figure disappeared from the original spot.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>He appeared in another place.</p><p></p><p>There, two ferocious beasts were crouching on the ground, one of which resembled a giant ape, standing several dozen feet tall, with muscular and powerful arms, a blue face and sharp fangs, and an extremely fierce aura.</p><p></p><p>The other ferocious beast was quadrupedal, with a scaled body, resembling a giant crocodile-dragon.</p><p></p><p>The auras emanating from these two ferocious beasts were quite powerful, comparable to the existence of a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>The two ferocious beasts were crouching on the ground, their bodies trembling, and in their originally bloodthirsty eyes, there was an instinctive fear.</p><p></p><p>The powerful aura at the Dao Palace Realm level from Gu Qingfeng was so overwhelming to these ferocious beasts that their instinct was to avoid harm, preventing them from daring to make any move.</p><p></p><p>Approaching the ape-like ferocious beast, Gu Qingfeng placed his palm on its head, and a powerful divine sense force surged into it, forcibly searching its soul.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>The ferocious beast's body trembled, but Gu Qingfeng's palm was like an immovable mountain, preventing it from struggling.</p><p></p><p>A large amount of information flooded into Gu Qingfeng's mind.</p><p></p><p>All the memories of this ferocious beast were revealed to him.</p><p></p><p>This ape was originally an ordinary ape, but later it accidentally swallowed a rare and precious fruit, and then learned to inhale and exhale the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, stepping onto the path of becoming a ferocious beast.</p><p></p><p>Then.</p><p></p><p>The ape relied on its powerful strength to slay and devour other ferocious beasts, gradually strengthening itself, until it became an existence comparable to a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>Most of the ape beast's memories were about slaughter, and the remaining memories were of little use to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity—"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head slightly, and then flicked his finger, causing the body of the ape-like ferocious beast to suddenly explode into a mist of blood.</p><p></p><p>Seeing its companion perish, the crocodile-like ferocious beast became even more terrified.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng followed the same procedure, searching its memories, but after going through all the memories, he found no information related to Gu Xuan, so he gave up on continuing the soul search.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng struck out with a palm, giving the ferocious beast in front of him a merciful end.</p><p></p><p>After slaying the two ferocious beasts.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng continued to search for the traces of other ferocious beasts.</p><p></p><p>His purpose was simple, which was to search through the memories of other ferocious beasts to see if he could obtain some useful information.</p><p></p><p>The powerful ferocious beasts that other cultivators shuddered at the mention of were now as weak as ants before Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the ferocious beasts were forcibly soul-searched and then slain on the spot.</p><p></p><p>These ferocious beasts.</p><p></p><p>The weakest ones were comparable to the Refining Impurity Realm, and there were also many that were on par with Sect Masters and Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>Even—</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also encountered a ferocious beast that was comparable to the Divine Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>If a ferocious beast of this level were to appear in the Nine States, it would be capable of massacring the entire Nine States.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Even a ferocious beast at the Divine Transformation Realm was not Gu Qingfeng's opponent.</p><p></p><p>The latter suppressed it with just one hand and then forcibly searched its soul.</p><p></p><p>This time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng obtained some different information.</p><p></p><p>In the memories of this Divine Transformation Realm ferocious beast, he saw the figures of many cultivators, whose strengths varied, including Sect Masters, Grand Masters, and even those at the Divine Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, most of these cultivators, when they encountered this Divine Transformation Realm ferocious beast, became its prey.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the face of a ferocious beast of this level, the so-called Sect Masters and Grand Masters were nothing but ants.</p><p></p><p>Even—</p><p></p><p>There was a powerful expert who had already reached the Divine Transformation Realm and could regenerate severed limbs, but he was still cruelly killed and became the food in the beast's belly.</p><p></p><p>"These should be the cultivators from outside the Nine States!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng understood.</p><p></p><p>Divine Transformation Realm cultivators, this was a level of strength that had not appeared in the Nine States for countless years, and combined with their attire being somewhat different from the Nine States, it was easy to determine their origin.</p><p></p><p>Clearly.</p><p></p><p>Although the Ancient Beast Mountain Range is dangerous, there are still many cultivators from the Primordial Realm who have entered this place.</p><p></p><p>After all, ferocious beasts are often accompanied by opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Like the top-tier heavenly treasures and earthly treasures, if one can consume them, they may be able to directly reach the realm of Grand Master, or even break through to the Divine Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>Such opportunities.</p><p></p><p>It's no wonder that people are eager to pursue them.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely because of the numerous ferocious beasts in the Ancient Beast Mountain Range that they have blocked the path of these cultivators from the Primordial Realm. Otherwise, the Nine States might have been exposed to the eyes of the powerful experts from the Primordial Realm long ago.</p><p></p><p>This Divine Transformation Realm ferocious beast had lived for thousands of years, so its memories were particularly long.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression slightly changed.</p><p></p><p>In the memories of the ferocious beast in front of him, he discovered the figure of a middle-aged cultivator in purple robes, who was flying through the air with an extremely powerful aura, instilling fear in this Divine Transformation Realm ferocious beast.</p><p></p><p>And beside the cultivator in purple robes, Gu Qingfeng saw a familiar figure.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan!</p><p></p><p>He could confirm that.</p><p></p><p>The memory he saw was not wrong.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the cultivator in purple robes and Gu Xuan, Gu Qingfeng only had a fleeting glimpse, as the Divine Transformation Realm ferocious beast did not dare to show itself in front of the powerful cultivator.</p><p></p><p>After finding the information he wanted, Gu Qingfeng looked at the Divine Transformation Realm ferocious beast in front of him and directly shattered its physical body with a palm strike, and then a blood-colored spherical object appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>A Beast Elixir!</p><p></p><p>This is a treasure that can only be condensed in the physical body of a ferocious beast that has reached the Divine Transformation Realm.

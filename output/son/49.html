        <h1>Chapter 49</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Boom—"</p><p></p><p>The stone floor cracked and shattered.</p><p></p><p>King Xue only felt a splitting headache, followed by a warm liquid flowing down from the top of his head. His head was dizzy and he still hadn't reacted to what had happened.</p><p></p><p>Next.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng grabbed King Xue's head again and slammed it against the ground several times, until the other's face was a bloody mess, almost on the verge of death, before he finally released his grip on the other's face.</p><p></p><p>Straightening up.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the unconscious King Xue lying on the ground, then spat out a mouthful of saliva, and then looked at Ye Shiya and Song Lan, who were frozen in place, with an extremely cold expression.</p><p></p><p>"The little Qingyang Sect, really thinks they are something, daring to come to my Gu family and kill people!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Ye Shiya barely reacted, his gaze towards Gu Qingfeng filled with terror, his voice trembling as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"My, my father is the, the Sect Master of Qingyang Sect, you can't kill me—"</p><p></p><p>Ye Shiya no longer cared about face, directly bringing up Ye Nanqiu's name, trying to intimidate Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately.</p><p></p><p>Before Ye Shiya could finish speaking, Gu Qingfeng had already kicked him away with a foot, the former's chest caved in, and he had already died before even hitting the ground.</p><p></p><p>The remaining Song Lan was frightened out of her wits, a warm liquid seeping out from between her legs, soaking her skirt without her even noticing.</p><p></p><p>Before she could beg for mercy, Gu Qingfeng pressed down with a palm, sinking her head into her chest, a large splash of blood bursting open, and her lifeless body immediately collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Drag them away and bury them!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said indifferently, and the many guards behind him finally snapped out of their daze, not daring to hesitate for a moment, directly dragging the two corpses away.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng then said to Meng Peng.</p><p></p><p>"Imprison this person in the dungeon, I want to interrogate him personally!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes—"</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng immediately led people to take the half-dead King Xue and imprison him in the dungeon.</p><p></p><p>The so-called dungeon.</p><p></p><p>Was a place that Gu Qingfeng had built recently.</p><p></p><p>From the matter of Sitian, Gu Qingfeng understood one thing, that is, if he were to capture the enemy alive, he would need a place to interrogate them, and so he had built a dungeon.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly.</p><p></p><p>The dungeon had just been built for a few days, and it already had a guest staying.</p><p></p><p>As Meng Peng took the person away, Gu Qingfeng turned to look at Gu Yang, and unusually praised him.</p><p></p><p>"This time you did well, that Ye Shiya has already entered the Blood Refining intermediate stage, and you were able to easily crush him, showing your solid foundation. I have a task for you to do next."</p><p></p><p>"Father, please instruct me!"</p><p></p><p>"I want you to thoroughly investigate the background forces of the Qingyang Sect."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said.</p><p></p><p>Since he had offended the Qingyang Sect, he needed to truly understand the other party's background in order to make the appropriate preparations.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I will obey your command!"</p><p></p><p>At this point.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang carefully asked.</p><p></p><p>"I have a question, Father, what is your current cultivation level?"</p><p></p><p>King Xue was obviously a Bone Refining expert, yet he was pressed to the ground and rubbed by Gu Qingfeng without any resistance, showing the latter's terrifying strength.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled calmly: "As long as the Qingyang Sect does not have any Washing Soul Realm or higher experts, I can handle it."</p><p></p><p>This simple sentence shook Gu Yang's heart.</p><p></p><p>He had already estimated Gu Qingfeng's strength to the maximum.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The walls of the dungeon were lit by numerous oil lamps, illuminating the entire prison cell as bright as daylight.</p><p></p><p>In the dungeon, Xue Wang was disheveled and filthy, tightly bound in a spread-eagle position on a wooden frame. His ribs had been pierced by iron hooks, and fresh blood was flowing from the wounds.</p><p></p><p>Through the broken flesh and blood, one could see bones that were a mixture of bronze and silver, indicating that Xue Wang was a cultivator who had achieved the Copper Bone Perfection and had even attained some Silver Bone.</p><p></p><p>Because cultivators at the Bone Refining Realm possess extraordinary vitality, Xue Wang had not yet perished from such grievous injuries, which would have already been fatal for an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng entered the dungeon, the man on the wooden frame, as if sensing something, slowly raised his blood-stained and dirty face.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you..." Xue Wang's voice was hoarse, his eyes filled with shock and resentment. He never imagined that he, a venerable Elder of the Qingyang Sect, would end up in such a predicament.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Xue Wang even more was Gu Qingfeng's terrifying strength, which had completely overwhelmed him without any chance to retaliate. This power made Xue Wang feel utterly helpless.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the person before him was no ordinary individual, and his strength was at least at the level of Gold Bone Perfection.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stood with his hands behind his back, his gaze indifferent as he looked at Xue Wang.</p><p></p><p>"I am Gu Qingfeng, the current Head of the Gu Clan. With your level of strength, you should have had a renowned reputation, but you chose to come into conflict with my Qingyang Sect. The Qingyang Sect has stood in Guangyang Prefecture for centuries and has a profound foundation that you cannot even begin to imagine. If you release me, we can pretend that none of this ever happened, and the Qingyang Sect and the Gu Clan can coexist peacefully."</p><p></p><p>Xue Wang pleaded, but Gu Qingfeng shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"It's too late for that. I've already killed the one who claimed to be the Qingyang Sect's Sect Master's son. Our two factions are now destined to be at odds."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Xue Wang's face changed drastically. He hurriedly tried to persuade Gu Qingfeng, but was interrupted.</p><p></p><p>"It's not a matter of whether the Qingyang Sect wants to fight the Gu Clan or not, but whether the Gu Clan is willing to spare the Qingyang Sect. Tell me everything you know about the Qingyang Sect and the purpose of your mission here, and perhaps I'll grant you a quick death."</p><p></p><p>These words caused Xue Wang's expression to shift.</p><p></p><p>"You truly intend to make the Qingyang Sect your enemy—Ahhh!"</p><p></p><p>Before Xue Wang could finish speaking, Gu Qingfeng suddenly grabbed his hand and crushed the bones, causing excruciating pain that no ordinary person could endure. Gu Qingfeng continued to grind the half-bronze, half-silver bones until the entire hand was completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>Xue Wang's agonized screams echoed through the dungeon, but Gu Qingfeng's expression remained impassive. </p><p></p><p>"I'll give you one more chance. I don't want to hear any more nonsense from you. If you refuse, the consequences will be clear to you."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

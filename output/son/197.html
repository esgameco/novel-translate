        <h1>Chapter 197</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Tianyang Sword Sect is an immortal sect, passed down for countless generations, and it also occupies a strategic and crucial location.</p><p></p><p>Although the forces Gu Yang brought to attack the Tianyang Sword Sect are not numerous, they are all top-tier experts. Now entrenched on the mountain, even if tens of thousands of troops attack day and night, they can still hold out for a while.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p></p><p>any Sect Master</p><p></p><p>can be considered an enemy of the masses.</p><p></p><p>As long as they do not exhaust their strength,</p><p></p><p>ordinary people trying to eliminate a Sect Master would find the difficulty unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"Without my order, no one is allowed to take the initiative to attack. Each entrance of the Tianyang Sword Sect must be guarded by at least two Sect Masters. If one is exhausted, another shall replace them.</p><p></p><p>Remember, in this battle, we are not aiming to crush the besieging army, we only need to delay time!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at the cries of battle below the mountain, his expression calm and composed.</p><p></p><p>He has no less than ten Sect Masters under his command, as well as a group of warriors following him, who, although not at the Sect Master realm, are at least at the Refining Impurity stage.</p><p></p><p>This force</p><p></p><p>is sufficient to defend for a considerable period of time.</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p></p><p>the Tianyang Sword Sect is not lacking in food and water sources, so there is no problem at all.</p><p></p><p>The site selection of any sect is done with great care. If there were problems with food and water sources, the Tianyang Sword Sect's ancestors would not have chosen this place.</p><p></p><p>"We will obey the order!" </p><p></p><p>The group, including Gu Yu, immediately saluted and withdrew to lead the other warriors to guard the various mountain passes.</p><p></p><p>Soon, only Gu Yang was left in the main hall.</p><p></p><p>"This battle will depend on whether your besieging forces are faster, or my reinforcements arrive sooner!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>However, despite these words, he had a confident expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>Before he led the troops to the Tianyang Sword Sect, he had already made the necessary preparations. As long as there are no unexpected events, the Guangyang Army should arrive soon.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the Guangyang Army arrives,</p><p></p><p>all problems will no longer be problems.</p><p></p><p>"After this battle, the South Yang Prefecture will have no more resistance forces, and I will control the two prefectures. The four prefectures of Qingyun State south of the South Yang Prefecture have the strongest power in South Yang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>With me controlling the two prefectures, the remaining two prefectures will be of no concern!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression was calm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Within the Iron Sword Sect, a powerful aura suddenly erupted, shaking the heavens with its mighty true qi. Terrifying spiritual energy gathered and converged into a divine sword that pierced the azure sky.</p><p></p><p>All the people in the Iron Sword Sect looked up at that divine spiritual sword, their faces filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master, Lu Ying, was now beaming with delight.</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Elder has broken through!"</p><p></p><p>"With this, our Iron Sword Sect will definitely rise, possessing a prosperity greater than ever before!!"</p><p></p><p>When the Sword Dao Cultivator went to the Blood Mountain Prefecture, Lu Ying had thought the person would not return.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly,</p><p></p><p>the Sword Dao Cultivator returned soon, and upon returning, immediately went into seclusion.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p></p><p>Lu Ying naturally understood the purpose of the seclusion.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the Sword Dao Cultivator had previously been in seclusion for two hundred years without being able to truly break through to the Great Sect Master realm. This time, the chances of a successful breakthrough were not high.</p><p></p><p>But now,</p><p></p><p>that aura surpassing the Sect Master realm made Lu Ying realize that the Sword Dao Cultivator had finally succeeded in taking that step.</p><p></p><p>Taking that one step</p><p></p><p>meant becoming a Great Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Since ancient times,</p><p></p><p>the truly powerful capable of contending for the title of Great Sect Master have been extremely rare in the world.</p><p></p><p>Now,</p><p></p><p>the Iron Sword Sect has also produced a Great Sect Master, how could this not excite Lu Ying.</p><p></p><p>After all, with a Great Sect Master guarding the sect, the Iron Sword Sect can become the number one sect in South Yang Prefecture, and even among the Nine States, the Iron Sword Sect can rank among the top.</p><p></p><p>More importantly,</p><p></p><p>the lifespan of a Great Sect Master is three hundred years longer than an ordinary Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>That is to say,</p><p></p><p>for the next three hundred years, the Iron Sword Sect will have a Great Sect Master in existence.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Great Sect Master eventually passes away, they can leave behind appropriate inheritance.</p><p></p><p>For all these reasons,</p><p></p><p>the appearance of a Great Sect Master at least ensures the prosperity of the Iron Sword Sect for a millennium.</p><p></p><p>This</p><p></p><p>is the real reason why Lu Ying is so excited.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>the celestial anomalies that had appeared did not last long and soon dissipated.</p><p></p><p>When the Sword Dao Cultivator appeared in the sect's main hall again, the aura of decline had completely disappeared, replaced by a vibrant vitality.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Supreme Elder, for attaining the realm of Great Sect Master, extending your lifespan by three hundred years!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Ying immediately cupped his hands in salute, his face filled with joy.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Cultivator smiled slightly: "After two hundred years of seclusion, this old man still could not find the key. If I had not gone to the Blood Mountain Prefecture this time, the breakthrough would not have been so easy."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, the Sword Dao Cultivator sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The common people all thought he had only broken through to the Great Sect Master realm and extended his lifespan by three hundred years.</p><p></p><p>But only the Sword Dao Cultivator himself knew that when he broke through to the Great Sect Master realm, he had also successfully cultivated the Blood Refining Scriptures.</p><p></p><p>Perfect skin refinement!</p><p>Perfect blood refinement!</p><p>Succeeding in both, his lifespan was further extended by another three hundred years.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>the Sword Dao Cultivator's lifespan was not just extended by three hundred years, but a full six hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A century is equivalent to living another lifetime.</p><p></p><p>After all, even a martial arts grandmaster can only live for about five hundred years at most.</p><p></p><p>But now, with a sudden breakthrough, one's lifespan can be extended by six hundred years, which is no different from living another lifetime.</p><p></p><p>However, the swordsman did not reveal these matters.</p><p></p><p>He was well aware of how significant the secret of longevity was, and if Gu Qingfeng was allowed to pass on the longevity technique, the swordsman would not divulge it without the other's permission.</p><p></p><p>This was not just a matter of integrity, but also to protect the entire Iron Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if they offended that individual, the Iron Sword Sect would be reduced to ashes in an instant.</p><p></p><p>This, the swordsman had no doubt about.</p><p></p><p>The battle at Blood Mountain allowed him to truly witness the terrifying power of that martial saint. Even though the swordsman had already broken through to the Great Grandmaster realm, in his eyes, he would not be able to match Gu Qingfeng as an opponent.</p><p></p><p>The higher the cultivation, the more one can sense the unfathomable depths of the other party.</p><p></p><p>Especially that ultimate strike that slew the evil spirit, just thinking about it still made the swordsman shudder.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that Gu Qingfeng's strength had reached an unimaginable level.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, even though the swordsman had broken through to the Great Grandmaster realm, he had no intention of becoming Gu Qingfeng's enemy.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, the swordsman changed the topic and asked, "I've heard that the Guangyang King has already led his troops into the Nanyang Prefecture. I wonder how the situation is now?"</p><p></p><p>"To let the Supreme Elder know, not long ago, the Guangyang King sent people to exterminate the Pei family, and at the same time, he also led powerful experts to besiege the Tianyang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>The latest news is that the Tianyang Sword Sect has been destroyed, but the imperial army and the various rebel forces in the Nanyang Prefecture have all dispatched large armies to surround and try to completely eliminate that individual within the Tianyang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Now, the entire Nanyang Prefecture is in turmoil, and all the factions are affected. Fortunately, the Supreme Elder has now reached the Great Grandmaster realm and can protect our Iron Sword Sect's stability..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Ying did not hesitate to tell everything.</p><p></p><p>But when he finished speaking, he noticed that the swordsman's expression had turned gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"You said the Guangyang King is being besieged at the Tianyang Sword Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>Lu Ying nodded instinctively.</p><p></p><p>But before he could finish his words, the swordsman spoke in a deep voice, "Immediately summon all the disciples of the Iron Sword Sect and go to the Tianyang Sword Sect to rescue the Guangyang King!"</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Elder, what do you mean by this?" Lu Ying's expression changed, and there was undisguised confusion in his eyes. He did not understand why the Iron Sword Sect would get involved in this turbulent situation.</p><p></p><p>After all, the current Tianyang Sword Sect was the center of the storm in the Nanyang Prefecture, and there was a possibility of the Iron Sword Sect being affected if they were not careful. Even though the Iron Sword Sect now had a Great Grandmaster, they should not have participated in this.</p><p></p><p>"The reason I was able to break through to the Great Grandmaster realm is closely related to that martial saint. I once promised that the Iron Sword Sect would obey the Guangyang King. Now that the Guangyang King is under attack, how can our Iron Sword Sect stand by and do nothing?"</p><p></p><p>The swordsman's words made Lu Ying's expression change repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the changes in the other's expression, the swordsman continued, "You have not truly witnessed the power of that martial saint, and you cannot comprehend the strength of such an existence.</p><p></p><p>Even though I have now broken through to the Great Grandmaster realm, I am like an ant before that individual."</p><p></p><p>"With such a powerful figure backing him, the Guangyang King has a high probability of sitting on that throne in the future. Nowadays, sorcerers are rampant, and martial artists are weak. The appearance of that martial saint will surely bring a resurgence of the martial dao."</p><p></p><p>"If our Iron Sword Sect can establish a relationship with that individual first, it will be all benefit and no harm."</p><p></p><p>The swordsman's words made Lu Ying fall silent.</p><p></p><p>He did not expect that this Supreme Elder, who had already broken through to the Great Grandmaster realm, would say such things.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng's achievements were indeed remarkable, they were not as shocking as when spoken by a martial arts Great Grandmaster himself.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I will go to the Tianyang Sword Sect first, and you will lead the disciples of the Iron Sword Sect to follow!"</p><p></p><p>The swordsman did not waste any time and gave the order directly before departing.</p><p></p><p>He had just broken through to the Great Grandmaster realm and heard such news, so the swordsman could not sit still.</p><p></p><p>If the Guangyang King were to perish at the Tianyang Sword Sect, and that martial saint became enraged, it would be a catastrophic situation.</p><p></p><p>The evil spirit from Blood Mountain, if it were to emerge, would have the qualifications to turn the entire Nanyang Prefecture into ruins.</p><p></p><p>And Gu Qingfeng's strength was even more terrifying than the evil spirit from Blood Mountain. If something were to happen to the Guangyang King, who was the other party's direct descendant, the scope of the impact would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, both emotionally and rationally, the swordsman had to take action.</p><p></p><p>He did not even dare to hesitate for a moment, fearing that he might arrive too late.</p><p></p><p>As the swordsman left, Lu Ying's expression also fluctuated, but in the end, he gritted his teeth and decided to follow the swordsman's orders.</p><p></p><p>After all, the swordsman was the Supreme Elder of the Iron Sword Sect, and the only Great Grandmaster at the moment. Even as the sect leader, Lu Ying could not disobey the other's words.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the things the swordsman said also made some sense to Lu Ying.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Lu Ying issued an order to gather all the disciples of the Iron Sword Sect. Except for the necessary forces to guard the sect, the rest would be sent to reinforce the besieged Tianyang Sword Sect.</p>

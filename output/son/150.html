        <h1>Chapter 150</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has seen an increase in his reputation!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by 3 Refining Impurity Realm martial artists!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang'..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"It seems he has succeeded!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng glanced at the information panel, and when he saw that Gu Yang had already occupied Guangyang Prefecture, he understood that the other party had taken a critical step.</p><p></p><p>To contend for the world, one needs to at least be able to use a prefecture as a foundation.</p><p></p><p>If one cannot even control a single prefecture, how can one contend for the world?</p><p></p><p>The only thing that made Gu Qingfeng feel a bit regretful was that when Gu Yang occupied Guangyang Prefecture, he did not achieve any accomplishments.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, although Gu Qingfeng was a little disappointed, he also quickly let it go.</p><p></p><p>Accomplishments are not easy to trigger.</p><p></p><p>Since there was no accomplishment when occupying Guangyang Prefecture, it means the effort was not enough.</p><p></p><p>Then when he later occupies Taishan Commandery, or Qingyun State, or even the entire world, there will surely be accomplishments triggered.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if it is truly an accomplishment of conquering the world, Gu Qingfeng believes the reward will be extremely generous.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Gu Qingfeng refocused his thoughts and looked at the attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng  Age: 42/3000  Realm: Early Supreme Grandmaster</p><p>Martial Arts:</p><p>Gu Family Fist (Unbreakable Level 1), Heaven Thunder Sword Technique (Beginner), Hundred Tempering Golden Body (Golden Body Unbreakable Level 9), Seven Killing Blade Art (Killing Intent Level 3), Heaven Dipper Invincible Body (Protective Qi Level 4), Heaven Dipper Divine Body (Indestructible Divine Body Level 1), Qingyang Technique (Ninth Layer Perfected, Pure Yang Qi and Blood Level 8), Five Viscera Classic (Fifth Layer, Five Viscera as Divine Level 5), Chaos Precious Mirror (Fifth Layer, Refine Impurity as Iron Level 5), Tyrannical Blade Slash (Perfected, Tyrannical Blade Intent Level 9), Scarlet Flame Divine Skill (Ninth Layer Perfected, Scarlet Flame Palm Strength Level 8), Mysterious Heart Saint Body (Third Layer Perfected, Flesh as Jade Level 2), Great Golden Immortal Body (Third Layer Perfected, Flesh as Diamond Level 2), Prajna Sutra (Thirteenth Layer Perfected, Prajna True Body Level 12), Sun Moon Fist Classic (Not Learned), Wind Thunder Blade Art (Perfected, Wind Thunder Blade Intent Level 3), Heavenly Vein True Classic (First Layer), Longevity Technique (Perfected, Longevity Level 1)</p><p>Upgrade Points: 13</p><p></p><p>This is Gu Qingfeng's current attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>On the panel, many previous low-grade martial arts have disappeared, replaced by a martial art called the Longevity Technique.</p><p></p><p>This martial art was created by Gu Qingfeng by refining and integrating all the martial arts of the world, forming the true perfect martial dao.</p><p></p><p>However, the Longevity Technique has just reached the first layer, which involves refining the skin layer.</p><p></p><p>To go further, Gu Qingfeng still needs to continue to refine and perfect it.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, compared to other low-grade martial arts, even as a low-grade martial art, the Longevity Technique can trigger a special ability when perfected.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that normally, a martial art needs to be at least mid-grade to trigger a special ability.</p><p></p><p>But the Longevity Technique created by Gu Qingfeng is different - it can trigger a special ability even as a low-grade martial art, and this special ability is longevity.</p><p></p><p>Perfectly refining the skin layer can increase lifespan by 100 years, so the longevity special ability of the Longevity Technique is also normal.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, the beginning of all things is difficult.</p><p></p><p>Now that Gu Qingfeng has taken the first step in creating the Longevity Technique, the difficulty in further advancing it will actually decrease significantly.</p><p></p><p>At least, pushing the Longevity Technique to the level of refining the impurity realm will not be too difficult.</p><p></p><p>This is because Gu Qingfeng himself is already at the Supreme Grandmaster realm, so he does not need to blindly grope when creating the Longevity Technique, but can draw on his own experience.</p><p></p><p>Compared to that, if he were to create something from scratch or in a realm he has never touched before, the difficulty would be much greater.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It increased tenfold out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>The reason this martial art was named the "Longevity Sutra" was because the perfect martial dao had the prospect of directly pointing to longevity.</p><p></p><p>Longevity! This was also Gu Qingfeng's own pursuit.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng continued to ponder and develop the martial art.</p><p></p><p>The first layer of the Longevity Sutra was just the first step. To bring the perfect martial dao into the world, he had to create a cultivation method that could directly point to the Refining Impurity Five Realms at the very least.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the state of the perfect martial dao, if one could complete the Refining Impurity Five Realms, the level of one's life could also be transformed, and one's combat power would be enough to rival the so-called sect master experts.</p><p></p><p>Even.</p><p></p><p>It would be no problem to say that it could rival the top-tier sect masters.</p><p></p><p>Initially, even before Gu Qingfeng had perfectly refined the impurities, he was able to instantly kill Fusion Spirit Realm cultivators, which was largely due to the tyrannical sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Powerful foundation.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with sufficiently powerful sect master intent.</p><p></p><p>The two combined.</p><p></p><p>Slaying Fusion Spirit Realm and ordinary sect masters was as simple as eating and drinking.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary people, if they could cultivate the Longevity Sutra to the Refining Impurity Five Realms level, not to mention comparing to Gu Qingfeng's stage, but they would still be able to suppress many powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>As Gu Yang occupied Guangyang Prefecture, the news spread quickly, and the entire Qingyun State was shaken.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang returned to the Gu family manor.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Father!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the present Gu Yang, Gu Qingfeng's expression slightly changed. Compared to a few months ago, the other party's changes were indeed considerable. The slight youthfulness on his face had completely disappeared, and a strong aura of iron and blood permeated him, with a faint aura of domination between his brows.</p><p></p><p>That was the bearing of a superior.</p><p></p><p>Evidently.</p><p></p><p>Commanding a large army and suppressing a prefecture had also brought about tremendous changes in Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>From the current situation, Gu Yang still held the same respect for his father as before.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that you're back. I heard you have now taken control of Guangyang Prefecture. What are your plans for the future?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang spoke in a deep voice, "Now that natural disasters are rampant, the court has lost its virtue, and cultivators are causing havoc, I must purge the world and strive to secure a glimmer of hope for the common people."</p><p></p><p>"Are you planning to declare yourself king?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang nodded, his expression extremely serious.</p><p></p><p>"Now that I have taken control of a prefecture, I should raise a banner and declare myself king. This way, I can also rally the righteous heroes of the world to work towards a great cause!"</p><p></p><p>If we turned the clock back twenty years, Gu Yang would not have had the idea of declaring himself king.</p><p></p><p>At that time.</p><p></p><p>Qingyun State was not yet in chaos.</p><p></p><p>Although the Taixuan Dynasty was already in decline, it still maintained a certain degree of control over the world.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>If he had openly rebelled and declared himself king back then, he would have surely incurred the thunderous wrath of the court.</p><p></p><p>But now it's different.</p><p></p><p>Now, righteous armies have risen up all over the world, and the situation in the Central Plains is in utter chaos. In Qingyun State, with Pei Jing raising the banner of rebellion, coupled with the successive natural disasters and his eventual demise, the waters have been thoroughly muddied.</p><p></p><p>At this time, if Gu Yang were to declare himself king, in his view, the benefits would outweigh the drawbacks.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered for a moment, then nodded, "If you have this intention, then go ahead and do it. Even if the heavens were to collapse, your father will be there to support you!"</p><p></p><p>"With Father's words, I shall be at ease!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's face was filled with gratitude, and at the same time, boundless confidence welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 75</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng had already clearly understood the course of events from the information panel, he still wanted to inquire about it.</p><p></p><p>As the words fell.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's face also revealed a smile, and then he nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Your son was fortunate enough to comprehend a martial art from the Master's true intent, and this martial art is called the Tyrannical Saber Slash!"</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was satisfied.</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch's true intent map has been in the possession of the Zhu family for many years, but they have never been able to comprehend anything from it. Unexpectedly, you were able to gain insight into a supreme martial art of the Patriarch in just one month.</p><p></p><p>Impressive, truly impressive!"</p><p></p><p>A supreme martial art of the Patriarch!</p><p></p><p>In the entire jianghu, such arts were certainly not many.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Yang could comprehend the Tyrannical Saber Slash, even if his cultivation was only at the Refining Blood realm, his overall strength would likely make a rapid and fierce advancement.</p><p></p><p>Immediately.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took Gu Yang to the backyard and engaged in sparring with him, so as to witness the supreme martial art.</p><p></p><p>"Please instruct me, Father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang did not hesitate, and as soon as he spoke, the moment his right hand grasped the hilt of the saber, his aura suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>In the next breath.</p><p></p><p>The long saber was drawn from its sheath.</p><p></p><p>The brilliant saber qi, as if containing the might of the heavens, had not even arrived in the attack, but the overwhelming saber intent was already able to assault one's mind and spirit, making the blood seem to be completely frozen.</p><p></p><p>Powerful as thunderbolts.</p><p>Tyrannical and unparalleled!</p><p></p><p>Facing this saber strike, Gu Qingfeng's eyes revealed a hint of admiration, and then he extended two fingers, easily shattering the saber qi, and finally pinched the saber tip, keeping it steadily three inches from his own brow.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng turned his two fingers and flicked with his finger, and Gu Yang suddenly felt a great force transmitted through the saber, causing the saber hilt to almost slip from his hand, and his entire body was involuntarily forced to retreat several steps.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad!"</p><p></p><p>"This saber truly deserves to be called a supreme martial art of the Patriarch. That saber intent just now, if it were an ordinary Refining Bone realm cultivator, they might not even be able to withstand it."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng gave a fair evaluation.</p><p></p><p>The saber techniques of the Tyrannical Saber Slash were not particularly exquisite, but with that extra touch of tyrannical saber intent, it had completely risen to a higher level, and its power was incomparable.</p><p></p><p>After witnessing the so-called supreme martial art, Gu Qingfeng's heart had gained further enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Supreme martial art!</p><p></p><p>At this level of supreme art, it was no longer confined to simple technique variations, but rather emphasized the so-called realm of intent.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng couldn't help but think of his own Seven Kill Saber Technique.</p><p></p><p>This saber technique.</p><p></p><p>He had also comprehended the true meaning of slaughter.</p><p></p><p>In other words.</p><p></p><p>At this level of the Seven Kill Saber Technique, even if it could not be considered a supreme martial art of the Patriarch, it was likely already touching the threshold of the Patriarch's realm.</p><p></p><p>At leastâ€”</p><p></p><p>Both involved the existence of true intent.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also seemed to understand how to have the opportunity to comprehend the Patriarch's true intent.</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang also sighed with emotion: "Father's accomplishments are extraordinary, and even though I have comprehended the Tyrannical Saber Slash, I am no match for you at all!"</p><p></p><p>"The Tyrannical Saber Slash is undoubtedly powerful, you are just a little lacking in cultivation. But even so, with your Refining Blood realm cultivation combined with the Tyrannical Saber Slash, you have the potential to match a Refining Bone realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>When you one day reach the Washing Marrow or even Refining Vitals realm, I may not even be your opponent."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, you have just recently comprehended the Tyrannical Saber Slash, and have not yet truly grasped much of its profound mysteries. If you delve deeper into it, your strength can rise even further."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's encouraging words restored Gu Yang's confidence.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>For Gu Yang, there was nothing more useful than Gu Qingfeng's affirmation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Yang said, "Over the past month, the Zhuo family has already sent people to take control of the Taishan Road, and many aristocratic families in Guangyang Prefecture are dissatisfied. They have dispatched powerful cultivators to enter the Taishan Road. </p><p></p><p>Now, the Taishan Road has become a gathering place for various forces, constantly engaged in fierce struggles.</p><p></p><p>Father, how do you think the Gu family manor should act?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had been closely monitoring the situation on the Taishan Road. After all, the White Stone Sect had once been under the jurisdiction of the Taishan Road, and the Qingyang Sect was destroyed by the Gu family manor. How could Gu Yang not be concerned?</p><p></p><p>Given the chaotic situation on the Taishan Road, it was understandable that Gu Yang felt worried.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng's expression remained calm: "There's no need to get too involved in the affairs of the Taishan Road. Let them fight it out if they want to. I only promised to allow the Zhuo family to take control of the Taishan Road. As for whether they truly have the strength to dominate the Taishan Road, that depends on the Zhuo family's own abilities."</p><p></p><p>"So let them fight, as long as it doesn't affect us. But if they dare to interfere with the White Stone Sect, then it will be time for me to take action, and there will be no need to hold back!"</p><p></p><p>"Even a thousand-year-old aristocratic sect may not necessarily be undefeatable."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes gleamed with a cold, murderous intent, emanating a chilling aura that made Gu Yang's heart tremble. Gu Yang immediately lowered his head.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, I will not allow the White Stone Sect to be disturbed!"</p><p></p><p>"Good. If you encounter any problems you can't solve, feel free to come to me. And your cultivation is still too weak, so strive to break through as soon as possible. In these turbulent times, strength is the foundation of everything!"</p><p></p><p>After Gu Qingfeng's reminder, Gu Yang took his leave. Watching the retreating figure, Gu Qingfeng soon turned his gaze away.</p><p></p><p>The chaos on the Taishan Road was within Gu Qingfeng's expectations. </p><p></p><p>Resources, be they abundant or scarce, were always coveted by various forces. The Taishan Road was among the top ten in Guangyang Prefecture, so it was natural that these powers would not miss the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>When the Qingyang Sect was still guarding the Taishan Road, other forces, though envious, did not dare to make a move easily. It was simply too risky to provoke a powerful sect.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the Qingyang Sect destroyed, the Taishan Road had become a leaderless domain. This led to a free-for-all among the various sects and aristocratic families.</p><p></p><p>As for this infighting among the sects and families, Gu Qingfeng had no intention of interfering. Occupying the entire White Stone Sect and the abundant resources it provided were already sufficient for the development of the Gu family manor.</p><p></p><p>In the short term, even if the Gu family manor were to seize control of the Taishan Road, it would not significantly enhance their strength. On the contrary, such an action would make the Gu family manor a target for all the other powers.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng understood that there was a fundamental difference between the martial prowess of the Gu family and the occult arts of the Zhuo and Jianqin families.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when Zhuo Feng came knocking, Gu Qingfeng readily ceded the Taishan Road in exchange for a certain price. This arrangement was entirely beneficial to the Gu family manor, with no downsides.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if these forces dared to interfere with the White Stone Sect, Gu Qingfeng would not hesitate to act.</p><p></p><p>"If they dare to meddle with the White Stone Sect, I will make them realize how sharp my blade is!" Gu Qingfeng murmured, emanating a chilling, murderous aura.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 109</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Appearance of the Bodyguard</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not make a big fuss about it, but only kept the bodyguard as a trump card for the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Intimate Moments</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng handed a medicinal pill to Xu Yulan and said, "This pill is called the Refining Viscera Pill. If you take it, you can directly become a powerful cultivator at the peak of the Refining Viscera Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Your martial arts talent is average, and the Refining Bone Realm is likely your limit without any accidents."</p><p></p><p>"Now with this pill, you can break through the Refining Viscera Realm. Not to mention reaching the Patriarch Realm in the future, but even living for two hundred years would not be a problem!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Gu Qingfeng's words, Xu Yulan's bright eyes were filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>Although she did not care much about the affairs of the jianghu, she was well aware of how difficult it was to cultivate the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>For a single pill to be able to break through the peak of the Refining Viscera Realm was simply unheard of.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yulan had no doubt about the efficacy of the Refining Viscera Pill.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Yang has just taken over the Gu Family Manor, and his cultivation is still weak. Husband, why don't you give this pill to Young Master Yang?"</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Yang has his own path to walk, and even Young Master Xuan and Young Master Xiu are the same. With their talents, the Refining Viscera Realm will not be their limit, and even breaking through to the Patriarch Realm would be easy for them.</p><p></p><p>So, you don't need to worry too much about their affairs. You just need to focus on improving your own strength."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Breakthrough pills and direct ascension pills are the same - the descendants who take them will not receive any improvement points.</p><p></p><p>Moreover...</p><p></p><p>As Gu Qingfeng said, whether it was Young Master Yang's talent or Young Master Xuan and Young Master Xiu's talent, breaking through the Refining Viscera Realm would not be a problem for them, even reaching the Patriarch Realm would not be too difficult in Gu Qingfeng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Even if they reached a point where it was difficult to break through, they could still have them take the breakthrough pills or direct ascension pills.</p><p></p><p>Since the information panel can provide breakthrough pills and direct ascension pills, it means that there will be opportunities to obtain them in the future.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the direct ascension pill for the Refining Viscera Realm. Gu Qingfeng even suspects that the direct ascension pill for the Patriarch Realm may also appear.</p><p></p><p>"Husband's kindness, this concubine has no way to repay it!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yulan's eyes were filled with charm, and her words were as fragrant as orchids, fully displaying her alluring demeanor.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the past, Xu Yulan's appearance after giving birth had not diminished at all, but rather added a different flavor. Even Gu Qingfeng was tempted in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>With a flip.</p><p></p><p>The two of them engaged in friendly exchanges once again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng walked out of the room.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the rising sun in the east, his expression was slightly pensive.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder they say that beauty is like a sharp knife that scrapes the bone. Now I can see that the ancients were not deceiving me."</p><p></p><p>Even with his current cultivation level, he still felt a bit fatigued after a night of exertion.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the main hall.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng came forward.</p><p></p><p>"This subordinate pays respects to the Old Manor Master!"</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Yang was the new Manor Master, Gu Qingfeng had been promoted to the position of Old Manor Master.</p><p></p><p>After two years.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng had also barely broken through to the initial stage of the Refining Bone Realm.</p><p></p><p>"You've been by my side for quite a while, haven't you?"</p><p></p><p>"This subordinate has been following the Old Manor Master for more than twelve years!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng's expression was also filled with nostalgia.</p><p></p><p>Twelve years seemed long, but when he looked back, it was as if it had passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>When he joined the Gu Family Manor, he was already over thirty years old, but he was still just an ordinary Refining Skin Realm martial artist.</p><p></p><p>Now, after twelve years...</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng was forty-eight years old.</p><p></p><p>For a Refining Skin Realm martial artist, the age of forty-eight was already past their prime.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The peak period, the vital energy and blood began to decline, gradually heading downhill.</p><p></p><p>That is, Gu Peng's current breakthrough to the Refine Bone Realm has increased his lifespan considerably, so he can slow down the aging process. Even if he is approaching fifty years old, he is still at a peak level.</p><p></p><p>"Twelve years..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded.</p><p></p><p>"With your talent, without the Breakthrough Pill, the possibility of breaking through to the Refine Bone Realm is not high. Now, even if you use the Breakthrough Pill to reach this step, it is probably the limit."</p><p></p><p>"This subordinate is clear about his own quality. If it were not for the Elder Master's willingness to grant this subordinate an opportunity, this subordinate would never have the chance to touch the Refine Bone Realm in his entire life.</p><p></p><p>So being able to reach this step, this subordinate is already very satisfied!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng was full of gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Many people are stuck at the Refine Skin and Refine Blood Realms, and he can enter the Refine Bone Realm. What else could he be dissatisfied with?</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng glanced at him and said indifferently, "If you are truly satisfied with the Refine Bone Realm, then you can go back."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Peng's expression showed a slight shock, and then he seemed to have realized something, hurriedly kneeling on one knee, clasping his fists and saying, "This subordinate's talent is limited, and it is difficult to break through, but this subordinate's heart still wants to go further, in order to relieve the Elder Master's worries!"</p><p></p><p>"Get up and speak."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng stood up as instructed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng casually threw a porcelain bottle over, which Gu Peng instinctively caught.</p><p></p><p>"Inside is a Refine Impurity Pill. This pill has no extra function, but after taking it, you can directly achieve the perfect Refine Impurity Fifth Realm, so I grant it to you."</p><p></p><p>Refine Impurity Pill! Can achieve the perfect Refine Impurity Fifth Realm!!</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's words made Gu Peng's breathing become rapid, and the hand holding the porcelain bottle was trembling uncontrollably. The excitement in his heart was indescribable.</p><p></p><p>"Elder... Elder Master... This subordinate... This subordinate..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng was a little incoherent.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng waved his hand, "You don't need to say any more courtesies. Go down and take the pill to cultivate. In addition, this is the Scarlet Flame Divine Skill, a supreme art that directly points to the perfect Refine Impurity Fifth Realm, with the hope of breaking through the Innate Grandmaster. I will also grant this to you today.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow, you will follow me to visit the Liuyun Manor!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng took a deep breath, caught the secret manual recording the Scarlet Flame Divine Skill, and then respectfully bowed and retreated three steps before turning and leaving.</p><p></p><p>Watching Gu Peng's retreating figure, Gu Qingfeng's expression was calm.</p><p></p><p>The reason he left a Refine Impurity direct promotion pill for Gu Peng was because the latter had been by his side for many years and was proficient in handling matters.</p><p></p><p>However, the Refine Bone Realm is still a bit lacking.</p><p></p><p>Especially now that the Gu Family Manor can access higher levels, the Refine Bone Realm, while not weak, cannot handle many things.</p><p></p><p>But if he can break through to the Refine Impurity Fifth Realm, it would be different.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, of the five Refine Impurity direct promotion pills, not counting the three given to the bodyguards and the one given to Xu Yulan, the remaining one was best suited for Gu Peng.</p><p></p><p>Back in the outer hall residence, Gu Peng adjusted his mind and immediately took the direct promotion pill. An unprecedented mighty power erupted, completely beyond his own control, and it automatically refined his physical body.</p><p></p><p>Copper Bone Perfected!</p><p>Silver Bone Perfected!</p><p>Golden Bone Perfected!</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, Gu Peng directly completed the refinement of the five viscera and entered the perfect Refine Impurity Fifth Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This is the power of the Refine Impurity Perfected!"</p><p></p><p>Feeling the river-like vital energy and blood power within his body, Gu Peng's expression was excited, and his gratitude towards Gu Qingfeng had reached a peak.</p><p></p><p>As the other had said, there was no need for any more courtesies.</p><p></p><p>But in Gu Peng's heart, he was already willing to devote himself to serving Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

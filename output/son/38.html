        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sound of a baby's cry.</p><p></p><p>And the information panel refreshing its display.</p><p></p><p>This completely put Gu Qingfeng's heart, which had been hanging in suspense, at ease.</p><p></p><p>"Your second offspring has been born!"</p><p></p><p>"Your third offspring has been born!"</p><p></p><p>Two pieces of information.</p><p></p><p>Conveying many things.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>The tightly closed door opened, and the experienced midwife said, "Congratulations, Lord Gu, your lady has given birth to twins, and both mother and children are safe!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, all those responsible for the delivery shall be rewarded with a hundred taels of silver. You shall follow Meng Peng to collect the reward."</p><p></p><p>With a wave of Gu Qingfeng's hand, the midwife and the other people in the room, upon hearing this, all had joyous expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Lord Gu!"</p><p></p><p>A hundred taels of silver.</p><p></p><p>Even if they didn't eat or drink for ten years, they might not be able to earn that much.</p><p></p><p>Now that Gu Qingfeng was so generous with his reward, it naturally made everyone overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>As for this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng didn't mind at all.</p><p></p><p>With the Gu family's current business, casually rewarding a few thousand taels of silver is just a small matter.</p><p></p><p>As the others went to collect the reward, Gu Qingfeng also walked into the room, only to see Xu Yulan lying weakly on the bed, with the two newborn children beside her.</p><p></p><p>"My lady has endured much!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took three steps in two, looking at the pale-faced beauty with a sympathetic expression.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Xu Yulan's colorless face revealed a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>"This is what I should do. Now that the two children have been born, has my lord decided on their names?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I have decided."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the two children in front of him, pondered for a moment, and then said,</p><p></p><p>"The elder shall be named Gu Xuan!"</p><p></p><p>"The younger shall be named Gu Xiu!"</p><p></p><p>As Gu Qingfeng's words fell, the information panel once again displayed text.</p><p></p><p>"Your second offspring has been named 'Gu Xuan'!"</p><p></p><p>"Your third offspring has been named 'Gu Xiu'!"</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the weakened Xu Yulan and immediately had people prepare nourishing dishes to help her regain her strength.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>The news of the Gu family's master adding two more offspring spread quickly.</p><p></p><p>In an instant,</p><p></p><p>the stream of people coming to offer their congratulations was endless.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family was now the sky of the White Stone Dao, and many forces were naturally rushing to curry favor.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was also in a good mood and personally received all the visitors.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye,</p><p></p><p>a month had passed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had also specially set up a full-moon banquet, inviting various parties to attend.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>the information panel refreshed with new text.</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has reached his full moon!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has reached his full moon!"</p><p></p><p>Since the birth of the two children, Gu Qingfeng had noticed that the information panel seemed to have changed in a few ways.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the information panel would only display text when he received a reward.</p><p></p><p>For example, when Gu Yang was born, or when Gu Yang broke through a cultivation realm, and so on.</p><p></p><p>But now,</p><p></p><p>the information panel frequently displayed text.</p><p></p><p>These texts were not related to rewards, but rather recorded the growth of his own offspring.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had some thoughts in his mind.</p><p></p><p>However, these were secondary matters.</p><p></p><p>What he wanted to see was whether, if the two children one day stepped onto the path of martial cultivation, they could also bring him certain benefits.</p><p></p><p>The full-moon banquet ended.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family then returned to its usual calm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang continued to handle the Gu family's affairs, while Gu Qingfeng spent most of his time in closed-door cultivation. Although the Scorching Sun Divine Palm was willing, but...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He currently has a fair number of mid-grade martial arts techniques.</p><p></p><p>Before breaking through the Refine Bone Realm, Gu Qingfeng had to cultivate as many mid-grade martial arts techniques as possible to enhance his foundation.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also took the time to guide Gu Yang's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's natural talent is very strong, and with the Blood Refining Elixir as a cultivation aid, it wouldn't take him too long to break through the Blood Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>Once Gu Yang breaks through the Blood Refining Realm, the rewards Gu Qingfeng would receive would certainly be extremely generous.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has also collected many precious medicinal materials to help Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu undergo the Marrow Cleansing, starting from when they were young to gradually build a solid foundation.</p><p></p><p>Each time the Marrow Cleansing was completed,</p><p></p><p>The information panel would display text:</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has completed a Marrow Cleansing, his innate talent has slightly improved!"</p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has completed a Marrow Cleansing, his innate talent has slightly improved!"</p><p>...</p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has completed a Marrow Cleansing, his innate talent has significantly improved!"</p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has completed a Marrow Cleansing, his innate talent has significantly improved!"</p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has gained enlightenment in the Gu Family Fist, his strength has slightly advanced!"</p><p></p><p>Over the past few months,</p><p>The information panel occasionally had new text updates, which Gu Qingfeng had become accustomed to.</p><p></p><p>But this time,</p><p>Gu Yang's changes also appeared on the information panel, causing Gu Qingfeng's expression to change slightly.</p><p></p><p>"As expected -"</p><p>"Since Xuan'er and Xiu'er were born, the information panel has indeed undergone changes different from before, and these changes seem to be more flexible than before!"</p><p></p><p>In the past, the information panel only simply recorded the rewards, without much other use.</p><p>But now, the information panel can update the changes of his offspring in real-time, allowing him to stay informed about the situations of Gu Yang and the others, which certainly makes Gu Qingfeng feel satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p>Meng Peng walked in from outside.</p><p>"Your subordinate pays respects to the Patriarch."</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>"The Crimson Sword Gate has sent a message, the Patriarch's sought-after Thousand-Year Ginseng has been found, and now the Crimson Sword Gate's Sect Master Shangguan Rong is waiting outside!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng's words made Gu Qingfeng's eyes light up.</p><p>"Let him in."</p><p>"Yes, sir."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long for Meng Peng to return, leading a person here.</p><p>Shangguan Rong immediately bowed deeply upon seeing Gu Qingfeng.</p><p>"Shangguan Rong pays respects to the Gu Patriarch!"</p><p>"The Sect Master need not be so courteous. I heard the Crimson Sword Gate has found the Thousand-Year Ginseng, is this true?"</p><p>"Indeed, a few days ago, one of our disciples unexpectedly found the Thousand-Year Ginseng, and after learning of this news, I immediately brought the Ginseng to present to the Gu Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>As Shangguan Rong spoke, he untied the bundle on his back, and a sandalwood lacquered box appeared before the three.</p><p>Gu Qingfeng took the sandalwood box and opened it, revealing a ginseng root lying peacefully inside. This ginseng was much larger than ordinary ginseng, and a refreshing fragrance permeated the air, just a simple whiff making one feel their mind and spirit soothed.</p><p>"Good, this is indeed the Thousand-Year Ginseng!" Gu Qingfeng's expression was overjoyed.</p><p>This Thousand-Year Ginseng was exactly the same as the one recorded in the Bone Refining Decoction, clearly the very thing he had been searching for.</p><p>With the Thousand-Year Ginseng in hand, the last precious ingredient for the Bone Refining Decoction has now been collected.</p><p>In that case,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng can now begin refining the Bone Refining Decoction and formally advance towards the Refine Bone Realm.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

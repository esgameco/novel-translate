        <h1>Chapter 107</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It had been two or three years.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stepped into this place once again.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the past, the evil aura in the Nine Turns Path was now even more dense, as if this was truly a realm of the dead, with an atmosphere of desolation permeating everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked towards the empty space ahead, where a phantom of the Buddha was seated in meditation, as if countless living beings were kneeling and worshipping at his feet. This scene, which should have been supremely sacred, was instead permeated with an eerie aura.</p><p></p><p>It was because the Buddha was bleeding, his entire body devoid of any divine grandeur, only showing signs of decay and rot. The once golden body of the Buddha had now become putrid and decaying.</p><p></p><p>The countless faithful followers kneeling beneath him were also like walking corpses.</p><p></p><p>In the moment of looking at the evil Buddha, their hollow, bleeding eyes also met his gaze.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, </p><p></p><p>a terrifyingly powerful spiritual force came crushing down, once again stirring in Gu Qingfeng the urge to kneel and submit, his entire being surging with blood and qi.</p><p></p><p>The next breath,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's will was like a blade.</p><p></p><p>He completely severed that spiritual force, and at the same time withdrew from the Nine Turns Path, his gaze towards the evil Buddha now tinged with more trepidation.</p><p></p><p>"This evil entity's strength has grown even more formidable than before!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had thought that with his cultivation reaching the pinnacle of the Fifth Realm of Purification, he was only a step away from becoming a Patriarch, his strength already able to narrow the gap with the evil Buddha.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly,</p><p></p><p>the evil Buddha's power had grown even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was unsure whether this was due to Pei Jing's blood sacrifice, or the evil Buddha's own astounding growth.</p><p></p><p>But he could see,</p><p></p><p>that the evil Buddha was now in a stage of transformation.</p><p></p><p>Once the transformation was complete, the evil Buddha would surely emerge from the Nine Turns Path.</p><p></p><p>At that time,</p><p></p><p>Guangyang Prefecture would likely be reduced to a land of devastation.</p><p></p><p>After taking a deep look at the evil Buddha, Gu Qingfeng turned and left without the slightest hesitation.</p><p></p><p>The evil Buddha's strength was not something he could currently contend with. Not only the evil Buddha currently undergoing transformation, even the previous evil Buddha was beyond his ability to handle.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng left without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>At the Gu Family Village,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng found Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>The latter's injuries had already recovered significantly. Although that strike had gravely wounded him, as a martial artist with a robust foundation, and with the aid of other healing medicines, the consequences were not too severe.</p><p></p><p>"Father, what is the situation like in the Nine Turns Path now?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang asked.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head: "The evil Buddha is undergoing transformation, and its strength is now even greater than before. If the evil Buddha truly emerges from the Nine Turns Path, Guangyang Prefecture will likely be completely devastated."</p><p></p><p>"From now on, you must also be prepared."</p><p></p><p>"If the evil Buddha appears, we may have to abandon this base and directly leave Guangyang Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>This was the worst-case scenario.</p><p>But they had to make preparations in advance.</p><p></p><p>After witnessing the evil Buddha's unfathomable power once again, Gu Qingfeng had already realized that if the evil Buddha emerged, the White Stone Sect would not be spared either.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression turned grim: "Pei Jing performed a blood sacrifice to the evil Buddha, but the court hasn't taken any action?"</p><p></p><p>"In the current chaotic state of the world, the court may not have the extra resources to deal with the evil Buddha problem. Moreover, the so-called court is really no more than a large sect or family clan."</p><p></p><p>"In their eyes, ordinary people are no different from livestock."</p><p></p><p>"No matter how many people die in Guangyang Prefecture, as long as it doesn't affect the foundation of the dynasty, as long as this world still bears the surname of the imperial house, the court will have no reason to intervene!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sneered.</p><p></p><p>Does the court not have the power to deal with the evil Buddha?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In Gu Qingfeng's view, this was absolutely impossible.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>Up until now.</p><p></p><p>The imperial court had not come to resolve the problem of the evil Buddha.</p><p></p><p>This shows that the imperial court did not want to waste too much of its power in Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The nine states of the world.</p><p></p><p>The Central State is the most esteemed.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, the imperial court's main forces are stationed in the Central State, in order to ensure the continuation of the imperial house and the stability of the dynasty.</p><p></p><p>After all, as long as the Central State does not have any problems, then the Taixuan Dynasty will always be the Taixuan Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>If not.</p><p></p><p>With the imperial court's strength.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the problem of the evil Buddha, just relying on a Pei Jing, he would not have the audacity to be so arrogant until now.</p><p></p><p>After all, compared to the strength of the Taixuan Dynasty, a Pei Jing is nothing, even if he has the backing of an immortal sect.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression changed, and the anger in his eyes was particularly obvious.</p><p></p><p>"The imperial court acts in this way, what qualifies them to let the world revere them!?"</p><p></p><p>"How will you proceed?" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said in a deep voice, "The world is corrupt, the heavens and earth are turbid, there must be someone who steps forward to purify the universe. Now the various rebel armies may seem powerful, but they are actually like that Pei Jing.</p><p></p><p>If these people obtain the world, this world will not change at all."</p><p></p><p>At this point.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang seemed to have made a decision, and he bowed deeply to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Your son dares to compete with the heroes of the world!"</p><p></p><p>"You want to rebel?" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng raised his eyebrows, then shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Not only you, even the entire Gu Family Manor now does not have the qualifications to compete for the world.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, if such an action fails, the consequences will be disastrous. You must remember this!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang's expression did not change: "This world must have someone stand up, even if it is full of danger, I want to try my best.</p><p></p><p>And the concerns in your words, I also understand, so I don't plan to act immediately, but first secretly accumulate and cultivate some strength, and only act when the time is ripe!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Yang's resolute expression, Gu Qingfeng looked at him deeply for a long time, then nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"As you said, the order of the world has already decayed, even if the dynasty is changed, it will be the same. But you must be clear that the root of this problem is not in the imperial court, but in the sorcerers and evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>As long as the sorcerers in the world are not eliminated, and the evil spirits are not destroyed, then the world will still be the same world."</p><p></p><p>"If you want to stand up and be the one to re-establish the rules and order, then you are destined to be the enemy of all the sorcerers in the world."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression remained firm, and he said solemnly, "This path is dangerous, but I still want to try!"</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded.</p><p></p><p>"From today on, you will be the lord of the Gu Family Manor, and all the resources within the manor are at your disposal. But I need to tell you, the immortal sects are not as simple as you imagine.</p><p></p><p>The top Enlightened Realm sorcerers are already able to rival Grandmaster-level experts.</p><p></p><p>And among these immortal sects, there must be existences above the Enlightened Realm.</p><p></p><p>If you want to compete for the world, you need to have sufficient powerful strength in your hands. This strength cannot be satisfied by just a few Grandmasters!"</p><p></p><p>"I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Qingfeng said, "Coincidentally, I will be leading people to go to Liuyun Prefecture these two days. You stay here and formally take over the affairs of the manor!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

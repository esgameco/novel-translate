        <h1>Chapter 208</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Central Plains.</p><p></p><p>The void trembled.</p><p></p><p>A towering figure suddenly appeared in the sky, overlooking the city below. The people in the city immediately noticed the abnormality and looked up in shock.</p><p></p><p>"He's flying in the air!?"</p><p></p><p>"This is the capital of the Central Plains, how dare someone act so boldly!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the Sword King's Mansion, come down at once—"</p><p></p><p>Powerful martial artists with imposing auras looked up at the figure in the sky, their expressions a mix of shock and anger.</p><p></p><p>Flying in the air.</p><p></p><p>While this was an extraordinary feat, it did not shock them too much.</p><p></p><p>After all, masters at the Transcendent realm and above could achieve brief flight if they wished.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this was the capital of the Central Plains. </p><p></p><p>Ever since the fall of the Taixuan Dynasty, it had fallen under the control of the Sword King, and the former imperial palace had become the Sword King's Mansion. </p><p></p><p>Currently, the capital not only had tens of thousands of elite soldiers, but also numerous powerful experts gathered here.</p><p></p><p>Even a grand martial dao master would find it difficult to escape.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword King's Mansion—"</p><p></p><p>Fu Zhao's expression was indifferent as he looked down at the city below, a flash of bloodlust in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"With so many martial artists, their vital energies are truly abundant. If I can refine them all, I can completely stabilize the realm I just broke through, and perhaps even advance further!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the many martial artists gathering below, Fu Zhao suddenly slammed down a palm, terrifying spiritual power coalescing into a massive palm strike that descended like a collapsing mountain, causing many martial artists to change expression in alarm.</p><p></p><p>"Danger!"</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p></p><p>Martial artists roared and unleashed their primal true qi and terrifying vital energies, trying to block Fu Zhao's attack.</p><p></p><p>But alas, their struggles were futile against a Transcendent realm expert.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying power pressed down, causing the so-called master-level bodies to suddenly explode, dissipating into a mist of blood.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, countless streams of vital energy surged towards the Fu Zhao in the sky.</p><p></p><p>A palm strike descended, shaking the city.</p><p></p><p>A horrifying palm print was deeply carved into the earth, countless martial artists and common civilians reduced to a bloody pulp by this single strike.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an elder of the Divine Sword Sect appeared, looking up at Fu Zhao in the sky and coldly saying, "The Nascent Soul realm experts of the major sects are not allowed to personally take action. Are you trying to fight to the death with our Divine Sword Sect?"</p><p></p><p>He did not recognize Fu Zhao's identity, but from the latter's casual annihilation of many masters, he could tell the other was at least a Nascent Soul realm expert.</p><p></p><p>However, even facing a Nascent Soul expert, this Divine Sword Sect elder was unafraid.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Divine Sword Sect was a supreme immortal sect, its foundations far beyond what a mere Nascent Soul cultivator could contend with.</p><p></p><p>Yet, as soon as he finished speaking, Fu Zhao's expression turned disdainful, and with a casual flick of his finger, the Divine Sword Sect elder had no time to react before his physical body exploded, the evil energy within him also awakening.</p><p></p><p>"Mere Harmonious Soul realm insects daring to act recklessly before me!"</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, with a thought, Fu Zhao unleashed a terrifying power that enveloped the entire city, and behind him in the void, a bizarre and ominous figure stood tall in the sky, like a demonic god from the underworld descending.</p><p></p><p>In the next instant, the strange figure extended its right hand and grabbed the awakened evil energy, then stuffed it into its own mouth to chew.</p><p></p><p>This sight left everyone else ice-cold.</p><p></p><p>"Forbidden... Forbidden Area!!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the presence of a supreme being that has condensed the Forbidden Area!"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, even at the peak of the Nascent Soul realm, one cannot condense a true Forbidden Area. Could you be a Transcendent realm expert—"</p><p></p><p>The moment they sensed the Forbidden Area, everyone could smell the scent of death.</p><p></p><p>The Forbidden Area! This was something only calamitous evil entities could condense.</p><p></p><p>But if a cultivator could condense the Forbidden Area, they would have to be at least at the Transcendent realm.</p><p></p><p>Now that Fu Zhao was displaying Forbidden Area techniques, it made these people feel a chill down their spines.</p><p></p><p>If he was truly a Transcendent realm expert, they were likely facing certain death.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Sword King had no choice but to step forward.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the figure in the sky and humbly said, "I do not know how I have offended you, sir. If you tell me, I will gladly apologize!"</p><p></p><p>Although the Sword King was a regional lord commanding millions of troops, a single order from him could decide the life and death of countless civilians, but in the face of such absolute power, he could only bow his head.</p><p></p><p>"It's not about offending me, the fault lies in you contending for the imperial throne with my Taixuan Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Zhao shook his head slightly, his words causing the Sword King's expression to turn shocked.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the Sword King had not expected the other to be from the Taixuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>But before the Sword King could speak again, Fu Zhao pointed a finger, and the Sword King's body exploded, killed on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Eliminating the Sword King.</p><p></p><p>For Fu Zhao, it was as simple as crushing an ant.</p><p></p><p>In this world where the strong prevailed, so-called authority was just a trivial matter. In the face of absolute power, everything else was insignificant.</p><p></p><p>"Today, all of you shall die!"</p><p></p><p>Murderous intent flashed in Fu Zhao's eyes, and then a terrifying aura burst forth from him, causing many in the city to be directly shattered by the pressure, their bodies turning into a mist of blood.</p><p></p><p>The remaining masters and Harmonious Soul realm experts could barely withstand this pressure.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, flee!"</p><p></p><p>An elder-level master, his expression horrified, wanted to escape the Forbidden Area.</p><p></p><p>As for confronting Fu Zhao, he did not have the courage. After all, at this level, eliminating masters was as simple as crushing ants, and any resistance would only lead to their own destruction.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the others also suddenly came to their senses and rushed towards the city gates.</p><p></p><p>In the void, Fu Zhao looked at the fleeing crowd with a disdainful expression.</p><p></p><p>Then he slammed down a palm, instantly killing many more martial artists and cultivators. He then extended his right hand, condensing terrifying spiritual power into a giant palm to grab a Harmonious Soul realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>In the latter's terrified gaze, Fu Zhao clenched his fist, causing the cultivator to explode into a mist of blood.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>The bizarre shadow behind him trembled, and Fu Zhao unleashed his true power with a palm strike, causing the centuries-old capital to crumble, annihilating all the martial artists and civilians within.</p><p></p><p>Millions of lives were extinguished, and the vast amount of vital energy surged into Fu Zhao, significantly strengthening his aura.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, a smile appeared on Fu Zhao's face.</p><p></p><p>"The vital energies of the masters are indeed remarkable. This has saved me a century of arduous cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had just entered the Transcendent realm, and his cultivation was not truly stable. But now, after massacring an entire city and refining the vital energies of its inhabitants, his unstable realm had been firmly consolidated.</p><p></p><p>Saving a century of arduous cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This was no exaggeration.</p><p></p><p>Then, Fu Zhao looked at the ruins of the capital, withdrew the Forbidden Area, and departed, flying away.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, in the ruins of the capital, some bloodstained figures emerged, looking at the direction Fu Zhao had left with terror-stricken expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Transcendent realm... this is the power of the Transcendent realm!"</p><p></p><p>"I must hurry back and report this to the sect leader!"</p><p></p><p>The master-level expert was completely terrified, not daring to linger in the ruins, and immediately fled in the opposite direction from where Fu Zhao had gone.</p><p></p><p>—</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the esteemed lord!"</p><p></p><p>"An undercover agent has brought urgent news from the Central Plains, please take a look!"</p><p></p><p>In the Gu Family Manor, an undercover agent hurriedly arrived, hastily handing a secret letter to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng waved the agent away, then opened the letter.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing the contents, his pupils slightly constricted.</p><p></p><p>"Annihilation of the capital!"</p><p></p><p>"All regional lords dead!"</p><p></p><p>"The Taixuan Sect has really turned the table over?"</p><p></p><p>The letter's contents stated that the Taixuan Sect's Grand Elder, Fu Zhao, had gone to the Central Plains and unleashed a massacre, completely annihilating the capital and slaughtering all the experts of the Divine Sword Sect, including the Sword King.</p><p></p><p>This was not all.</p><p></p><p>The capital's civilians and elite troops were all massacred by Fu Zhao.</p><p></p><p>One man annihilating an entire city! Fu Zhao's ruthless methods were evident.</p><p></p><p>However, this was not the full extent of Fu Zhao's actions.</p><p></p><p>After killing the Sword King, he directly attacked other regional lords, with the vast powers of the Central Plains nearly all being eliminated by him.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Central Plains had been reduced to a sea of blood and heads by Fu Zhao.</p><p></p><p>According to the undercover agent's report, Fu Zhao had slaughtered no less than tens of millions of people, truly incurring the wrath of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Gu Qingfeng took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"The law of the jungle!"</p><p></p><p>"When one possesses power that others cannot resist, the so-called rules and order become insignificant!"</p><p></p><p>Clearly, this was the case with Fu Zhao.</p><p></p><p>As the sole Transcendent realm expert in the world, he no longer cared about such things as order.</p><p></p><p>In the past, immortal sects that massacred the masses would at least find a reason, or be more discreet, and at least maintain a reputation.</p><p></p><p>But Fu Zhao's actions now showed complete disregard for these things.</p><p></p><p>Indiscriminate slaughter.</p><p></p><p>Even if it incurred the wrath of heaven and earth, he was utterly fearless.</p><p></p><p>The reason for this was simple - Fu Zhao was the only Transcendent realm expert in the world.</p><p></p><p>This alone was enough.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Gu Qingfeng also realized something else.</p><p></p><p>Fu Zhao's absolute power crushing the regional lords was clearly to allow the Taixuan Sect to dominate the world. After this massacre, the previous chaos in the Central Plains would be completely settled.</p><p></p><p>After all, with millions of heads rolling and the Transcendent realm pressure looming, the other immortal sects and great families would not dare to utter a single word of dissent.</p><p></p><p>Unless...</p><p></p><p>These immortal sects and great families also had Transcendent realm experts.</p><p></p><p>But—</p><p></p><p>After learning of Fu Zhao's actions, Gu Qingfeng was certain that the remaining immortal sects and great families did not have any Transcendent realm experts.</p><p></p><p>If such experts existed, the entire world would have already been turned upside down by the Transcendent realm, not waiting for Fu Zhao to make a move.</p><p></p><p>"The situation in the Central Plains is settled, the next target of the Taixuan Sect must be the Qingyun State!"</p><p></p><p>"Then let me see, whether this so-called Transcendent realm can withstand my sword!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes turned cold, and the previously calm Zhenxie Sword began to tremble slightly, a mighty aura of the sword emanating from it.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Wanting to eliminate all the evils under the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the movement of the Demon-Slaying Saber, Gu Qingfeng's expression became calm again.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, your time to be unsheathed will come soon!"</p><p></p><p>With these words spoken,</p><p></p><p>The Demon-Slaying Saber immediately quieted down. Thereafter,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng continued to seclude himself and wait for news from the secret guards.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' unexpectedly obtained the inheritance of a grandmaster, slightly increasing his foundation!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' was guided by a great grandmaster, his strength has improved slightly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' obtained the legacy of an ancient powerful expert, his cultivation has increased significantly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Shengnan' has made some breakthroughs in cultivating the Longevity Sutra, breaking through to the initial stage of the Refine Bone Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +30 Upgrade Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has gained some insights into the true meaning of the Heavenly Saber, his strength has increased greatly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has gained some insights in cultivating the Scripture of the Sun and Moon Fist, his strength has improved slightly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has gained some preliminary understanding of the true meaning of the Sun and Moon after studying the grandmaster's notes!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has gained some insights into the true meaning of the Heavenly Saber, gaining a preliminary understanding of the true meaning of the Heavenly Saber!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has obtained intelligence about the Central Plains, planning to lead a large army to battle the Taisuzu Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While Gu Qingfeng was in seclusion, the information panel kept refreshing.</p><p></p><p>When he saw Gu Shengnan's breakthrough, he was not too surprised.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Shengnan had reached the Refine Blood Realm for some time, and for an ordinary person, it would be impossible to break through to the Refine Bone Realm in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Gu Shengnan was different.</p><p></p><p>His talent was the strongest Gu Qingfeng had seen so far, and with the abundant resources of the Gu Family Manor, Gu Shengnan's breakthrough was quite normal.</p><p></p><p>"Xuan and Xiu's entry into the true meaning is not bad, but to truly master the grandmaster's true meaning, there is still a long way to go!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng mused.</p><p></p><p>Entry into the true meaning.</p><p></p><p>And the grandmaster's true meaning.</p><p></p><p>These were two completely different concepts.</p><p></p><p>Entry into the true meaning only requires the comprehension of the first level of true meaning, while the grandmaster's true meaning requires the comprehension of the sixth level of true meaning.</p><p></p><p>It is difficult to comprehend the true meaning, and to raise the true meaning to the sixth level, the difficulty is even higher.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>Even so,</p><p></p><p>For cultivators at the Refine Bone Realm like the two of them, being able to comprehend the first level of true meaning is already quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>Among cultivators of the same realm,</p><p></p><p>Very few can control the true meaning at this stage.</p><p></p><p>Even,</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators at the Refine Qi Realm may not be able to comprehend the power of the true meaning.</p><p></p><p>As for Gu Yang's current integration of a large army to confront the Taisuzu Sect, Gu Qingfeng was not surprised either.</p><p></p><p>The affairs of the Central Plains were no longer a secret.</p><p></p><p>The Taisuzu Sect might attack Qingyun State at any time.</p><p></p><p>As for this,</p><p></p><p>How could Gu Yang not have any preparations?</p><p></p><p>-</p><p></p><p>One day,</p><p></p><p>When a secret letter from Gu Yang arrived, Gu Qingfeng walked out of the Grinding Saber Hall, carrying the Demon-Slaying Saber, and headed towards the capital.</p><p></p><p>The Grandmaster-level神行百变 (Divine Movement), allowed Gu Qingfeng to cross hundreds of feet in an instant, which would be an extraordinary feat in the eyes of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>Even if a normal grandmaster cultivated the Divine Movement to perfection, they would not be able to reach Gu Qingfeng's level.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Guangyang Royal Palace,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang gathered many subordinate generals, including the Sect Master of the Shenwu Sect, Ancient Cloud, and the Supreme Elder of the Tiejian Sect, all of whom were present.</p><p></p><p>"The Transcendent Realm cultivator of the Taisuzu Sect has already massacred half of the Central Plains, and the Ling King is using this opportunity to integrate the remaining forces.</p><p></p><p>Now, according to the report of the secret guards, that Ling King has integrated a large army and intends to attack our Qingyun State."</p><p></p><p>"The primary target is our Taishan Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at the crowd, saying solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Of the four prefectures of Qingyun State, Taishan Prefecture and Danyang Prefecture border the Central Plains.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Ling King's army is targeting Taishan Prefecture, the purpose is obvious.</p><p></p><p>The other party wants to directly crush Taishan Prefecture with absolute power, suppress the Guangyang Army, and then control the entire Qingyun State.</p><p></p><p>After speaking,</p><p></p><p>Shizhen immediately said, "Your Majesty can rest assured, if the Ling King's army dares to come, your subordinate will ensure they have no return!"</p><p></p><p>The Three Thousand Six Hundred Heavenly Soldiers, this is Shizhen's greatest trump card.</p><p></p><p>The other generals also cupped their fists in response.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, our Qingyun State is not something a mere Ling King can easily manipulate!"</p><p></p><p>"The Taisuzu Sect has been massacring indiscriminately in the Central Plains, treating the common people like livestock and insects, and the people are outraged by such actions. If a war breaks out this time, the people's hearts will definitely be on Your Majesty's side, so why fear fighting them!"</p><p></p><p>"Qingyun State cannot be invaded, your subordinates will fight to the death!"</p><p></p><p>Over the years, Gu Yang has been recuperating in Qingyun State and implementing various policies beneficial to the people, which they have all witnessed.</p><p></p><p>Combined with Fuzhao's large-scale massacres in the Central Plains, if Qingyun State were to fall, the fate of others would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>Upon learning that the Ling King's army intends to attack Taishan Prefecture, none of the people present showed any intention of retreating.</p><p></p><p>The difference is,</p><p></p><p>Ancient Cloud and the Sword Dao Cultivator, among a few others, had a more solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"A mere Ling King is not a concern, but the biggest problem now is that Taisuzu Sect Supreme Elder, a Transcendent Realm cultivator who can further manipulate the demonic energy and condense a forbidden area.</p><p></p><p>In the forbidden area, even a million-strong army would be hard-pressed to contend!"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Cultivator said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Against such a powerful expert, to be honest, even he did not have the confidence to fight.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that the Sword Dao Cultivator had only broken through to the Grandmaster Realm a few years ago, even if he were a top True Meaning Grandmaster, he would still be completely outmatched.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Sword Dao Cultivator had not actually fought against such a powerful expert, from the previous records about the Transcendent Realm, he understood the terrifying power of such experts.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the words "Transcendent Realm",</p><p></p><p>The expressions of everyone present became solemn.</p><p></p><p>That's right.</p><p></p><p>They are not afraid of the Ling King's army.</p><p></p><p>Even if the other party controls two states, so what?</p><p></p><p>The Qingyun State has been recuperating for years, and they have an army of three million, with not a few elite troops.</p><p></p><p>Even if they are not as strong as the Heavenly Soldiers commanded by Shizhen, their combat power is still not weak.</p><p></p><p>But,</p><p></p><p>If they were to face a Transcendent Realm expert, that would be a different story.</p><p></p><p>After all, the news from the Central Plains made them aware of the power of the Transcendent Realm.</p><p></p><p>One person can destroy a city.</p><p></p><p>Casually massacring millions.</p><p></p><p>Grandmasters and so-called Fusion Realm cultivators are just slightly larger insects in the face of such an existence.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said, "Don't worry about Fuzhao, I have already sent a message back, and my father will personally take care of that Taisuzu Sect Elder in this battle."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the crowd eased up a bit.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Cloud said, "If it's Senior Gu taking action, then Fuzhao is definitely not a problem."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Gu's cultivation is unparalleled, and the incident of him slaying the demonic energy in Blood Mountain is still fresh in my memory. With Senior Gu taking action in this battle, I believe that Transcendent Realm cultivator won't be able to stir up too much trouble!"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Cultivator also nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>For them, the three words "Gu Qingfeng" were the greatest reassurance.</p><p></p><p>With him present,</p><p></p><p>Even if that Transcendent Realm cultivator is incredibly powerful, it is unlikely that they would pose a threat to Qingyun State.</p><p></p><p>As for the possibility of Gu Qingfeng being defeated, the two of them had not even considered it.</p><p></p><p>Only by truly witnessing the other party's strength could they understand the unfathomable power.</p><p></p><p>Although the Transcendent Realm is equally terrifying, it is not necessarily a match for him.</p><p></p><p>As for the others,</p><p></p><p>Even if they had some doubts in their hearts,</p><p></p><p>In this occasion, they did not dare to say much, lest they disturb the morale.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>A guard came in from outside.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the Lord of the Manor has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>"Quickly invite my father in!"</p><p></p><p>When Gu Yang heard these words, his expression immediately brightened.</p><p></p><p>Soon,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stepped into the hall.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang hurriedly stood up: "Your son pays respects to Father, please take the main seat!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>He directly gave up his own position, wanting Gu Qingfeng to take the main seat.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head: "You are the Guangyang King, you should sit in the main seat, I'll just find a random seat."</p><p></p><p>"Greet Senior Gu, why don't you take the seat of my disciple?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ancient Cloud also stood up, with a respectful demeanor, directly giving up his own seat.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded, and without any refusal, he sat down in the vacant seat, and Ancient Cloud stood behind him, with a reverent expression.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>The others also paid their respects to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Greet Senior Gu!"</p><p>"Greet the Martial Saint Senior!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng responded to them one by one with a nod.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>He looked at Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>"I heard the Taisuzu Sect is preparing to attack Qingyun State, how is the situation now?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Gu Yang also became serious, and said, "The Ling King's army has already integrated, and now they are preparing to march towards our Taishan Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>"This time, the Ling King's army is hundreds of thousands strong, obviously intending to use this battle to firmly establish their hegemony over the Nine States!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "The Ling King's army is coming with overwhelming force, does the Guangyang Army have the ability to deal with them?"</p><p></p><p>"Father, don't worry, the Guangyang Army has been recuperating for years, and we have several million troops under my command. If we really fight, we will not be inferior to anyone.</p><p></p><p>The biggest problem now is that Taisuzu Sect Supreme Elder, a Transcendent Realm cultivator, who is basically impossible for other armies to contend with."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>After speaking,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression did not change: "I will personally take care of the matter with Fuzhao."</p><p></p><p>"With Father's words, your son is at ease."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang finally had a smile on his face, even though he had already said that Gu Qingfeng would personally take action, but having the other party actually show up in person was much more reassuring.</p><p></p><p>In the following days,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stayed and resided in the royal palace.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang continued to integrate the army, preparing for the battle with the Ling King.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

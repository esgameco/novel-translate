        <h1>Chapter 206</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Martial Arts: Heaven Thunder Sword Technique (Introductory), Prajna Sutra (13th Realm of Perfection, 12 Levels of Prajna True Body), Heavenly Vein Sutra (2nd Realm), Longevity Technique (Perfected, 5 Levels of Longevity), Pure Yang True Body (Perfected, 4 Levels of Flesh Body Purification), Heavenly Saber (Perfected, 1st Level of Heavenly Saber Realm), Blood Refining Sutra (4th Realm, 4 Levels of Divine Blood), Divine Movement Hundred Transformations (Perfected, 4 Levels of Divine Speed) Upgrade Points: 128...</p><p></p><p>"One hundred and twenty-eight upgrade points!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems I can further upgrade the Blood Refining Sutra once more!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng mused.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p>He also wanted to try breaking through the limits of the Heavenly Saber technique after surpassing the Grand Master realm.</p><p></p><p>However, after seeing the upgrade points required to break through the limit, Gu Qingfeng temporarily gave up on the idea of upgrading the Heavenly Saber.</p><p></p><p>It was very simple.</p><p></p><p>To break through the Heavenly Saber limit,</p><p>Two thousand upgrade points were required.</p><p></p><p>Compared to breaking through the limits of Grand Master martial arts, it required twice as many upgrade points.</p><p></p><p>If the Heavenly Vein Sutra was included, the upgrade cost for the Heavenly Saber technique would rank second.</p><p></p><p>As for the Heavenly Vein Sutra, it would undisputedly rank first.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p>The third realm of the Heavenly Vein Sutra required ten thousand upgrade points.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng could hardly imagine how many upgrade points would be needed to condense the nine great Heavenly Veins.</p><p>It was probably an astronomical number.</p><p></p><p>Up until now,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng was still unclear about the true level of the Heavenly Vein Sutra.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng immediately spent one hundred upgrade points to directly upgrade the Blood Refining Sutra from the fourth realm to the fifth realm.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Surging blood qi erupted like a raging river, a terrifying aura emanating from Gu Qingfeng's body, the powerful blood energy enveloping the entire Whetstone Hall.</p><p></p><p>After a long while,</p><p>The blood qi gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>Moments later,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng opened his eyes and let out a long breath.</p><p></p><p>"The post-Grand Master realm, I have finally attained it!"</p><p></p><p>With the Blood Refining Sutra breaking through to the fifth realm, entering the ranks of Grand Master martial arts, his cultivation had also advanced, reaching the post-Grand Master realm.</p><p></p><p>This seemingly small breakthrough in realm, for Gu Qingfeng, represented a tremendous change in his strength.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng could now see the terrifying blood energy within him, even a single drop of ordinary blood was as heavy as a thousand catties.</p><p></p><p>Crushing mountains and splitting peaks</p><p>Were now trivial matters for Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity!"</p><p></p><p>"There are no truly powerful experts in the Nine Provinces worthy of my full strength, otherwise I could see the true limits of my current abilities."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression shifted slightly.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter,</p><p>He continued to ponder the Blood Refining Sutra.</p><p></p><p>This martial art was extraordinary.</p><p>Gu Qingfeng had only reached the fifth realm of the eight-realm Blood Refining Sutra so far.</p><p></p><p>If he could cultivate the Blood Refining Sutra using his own abilities, he could save a lot of upgrade points.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's cultivation breakthrough did not cause any commotion.</p><p>Advancing from the mid-post-Grand Master realm to the late-post-Grand Master realm, Gu Qingfeng did not show much outward change, and he would not openly boast about the growth of his own strength.</p><p></p><p>In the following days,</p><p>Everything returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>In addition to closed-door cultivation of the Blood Refining Sutra, Gu Qingfeng also guided Gu Shengnan, as well as Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps aware that his young niece had broken through to the Blood Realm Perfection before the age of eight, Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu, although still young, also felt a sense of urgency, so they were very diligent in their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p>Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu were a generation older than Gu Shengnan, with Gu Xuan being thirteen years old and Gu Xiu just over seven, the gap was quite significant.</p><p></p><p>Young people were always concerned about their reputation.</p><p>Moreover,</p><p>Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu had a reputation as geniuses since childhood in the Gu Family Manor, if they were surpassed by Gu Shengnan, it would undoubtedly be embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p>The two of them became much more diligent in their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As a result,</p><p>In just half a year, the two of them had successively broken through the Blood Realm Perfection and entered the Bone Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has broken through to the initial Bone Refining Realm!"</p><p>"Reward: 30 upgrade points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has broken through to the initial Bone Refining Realm!"</p><p>"Reward: 30 upgrade points!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"They broke through so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the information panel, his expression slightly surprised, then he shook his head and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I was too lenient in the past. Now that Shengnan is about to break through the Bone Refining Realm, it has put some pressure on them. But this is good, with pressure comes motivation.</p><p>Otherwise, with such abundant resources, it would be a complete waste!"</p><p></p><p>To be honest,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not expect that Gu Shengnan's displayed talent would put so much pressure on Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu. However, this was a good thing, as the two of them now had some pressure, at least they would not be as lazy as before.</p><p></p><p>The next day,</p><p>In the Gu Family Manor's main hall,</p><p>Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu came forward.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Father!"</p><p></p><p>"Speak, what is it?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng glanced at the two of them. Now that they were at the age of scholarly pursuits, their physiques were much more robust than their peers.</p><p></p><p>The two of them had three parts resemblance to Gu Qingfeng and seven parts resemblance to Xu Yulian in their appearance. Their looks were not bad at all.</p><p></p><p>The difference was that Gu Xuan wore white robes, giving him the aura of a graceful young gentleman, while Gu Xiu was burly and robust, and even as a youth, one could sense a trace of fierce energy about him.</p><p></p><p>"Father, we two have recently broken through to the Bone Refining Realm, so we have come to ask Father to teach us some new martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>The two of them exchanged a glance, and it was Gu Xuan who spoke.</p><p></p><p>"New martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng raised his brow.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want to learn?"</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that Father was once known as the Tyrant Saber in the jianghu, and your saber techniques have reached the realm of mastery, so I hope Father can pass on the Heavenly Saber technique to me."</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan unhesitatingly expressed his wish.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan was not unfamiliar with Gu Qingfeng's reputation in the jianghu. And since he was particularly fond of saber techniques, he naturally hoped to receive Gu Qingfeng's personal instruction.</p><p></p><p>As for this,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not answer, but instead looked at Gu Xiu.</p><p></p><p>"What about you? What do you want to learn?"</p><p></p><p>"I want to learn the fist technique!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiu said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly: "As for the fist technique, I have a Grand Master martial art passed down from the Divine Fist Sect, the legendary Suzerain Technique of the Sun and Moon Fist.</p><p>If you can cultivate this fist technique to perfection, you can also refine the ultimate essence of the true meaning, and at the same time temper your own physical constitution and blood qi, it is truly profound and extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Gu Qingfeng raised his hand and pointed, a surge of mighty true essence directly entered Gu Xiu's mind.</p><p></p><p>In an instant,</p><p>Gu Xiu felt the scene before him change, and suddenly the sun and moon appeared in the sky, the majestic celestial might pressing down, and he saw a figure of unparalleled prowess punching the mountains and rivers, truly worthy of being called the best under the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after,</p><p>Before Gu Xiu could react, a flood of memories surged forth, all related to the cultivation methods of the Sun and Moon Fist Technique.</p><p></p><p>After a long time,</p><p>Gu Xiu finally emerged from this torrent of memories, his eyes filled with awe.</p><p></p><p>"The Sun and Moon Fist Technique!"</p><p></p><p>He was both shocked by Gu Qingfeng's unimaginable methods, and amazed by the power of the Sun and Moon Fist Technique.</p><p></p><p>Although the information about the Sun and Moon Fist Technique had disappeared from the attribute panel, it did not mean that Gu Qingfeng had forgotten it.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng's mastery of the Sun and Moon True Essence and various other supreme martial arts had never been lost, it just no longer appeared on the attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>The Sun and Moon True Essence was fused and forged into the creation of the Heavenly Saber technique, but the Sun and Moon True Essence was still under Gu Qingfeng's control.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng displayed the fully perfected Sun and Moon True Essence before Gu Xiu.</p><p></p><p>This peerless fist technique left the other party deeply immersed in it.</p><p></p><p>"I have passed on the Sun and Moon Fist Technique to you, but whether you can truly master this martial art depends on your own natural talent."</p><p></p><p>With that, Gu Qingfeng casually handed Gu Xiu a master's manual obtained from the Divine Fist Sect.</p><p></p><p>"This is a manual left behind by a master of the Divine Fist Sect, with a trace of master-level true essence remaining, which can be of some benefit to the cultivation of the Sun and Moon Fist Technique.</p><p>When the true essence in this master's manual is exhausted, or when you formally enter the Sun and Moon Fist Technique and cultivate the true master's essence, then come find me again."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiu firmly grasped the master's manual, his expression filled with excitement.</p><p>The power of the Sun and Moon Fist Technique was the ultimate fist technique he had always dreamed of.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Xiu knew that Gu Qingfeng was renowned for his saber techniques, in the way of martial arts, it was not a matter of just cultivating the strongest technique, but whether it truly suited oneself.</p><p>Like the saber technique, Gu Xiu did not particularly like it, even if he were to obtain Gu Qingfeng's true saber technique transmission, his future accomplishments would be limited.</p><p></p><p>During his years in the Gu Family Manor, Gu Xiu had often received guidance from masters and discussed martial arts with others, and he already had his own unique perspective on the Dao of Martial Arts.</p><p>This level of martial arts insight was beyond the reach of ordinary jianghu cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivate well, and do not neglect your own cultivation, for the foundation of a martial artist lies in their cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng added a reminder.</p><p></p><p>To this,</p><p>Gu Xiu nodded in acknowledgement.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng turned his gaze to Gu Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"You want to cultivate the saber technique, and I do have a few saber techniques, but among the Grand Master and above saber techniques, there are only two - the Tyrant Saber and the Heavenly Saber. Which one do you wish to cultivate?"</p><p></p><p>"May I ask Father, which of the two saber techniques is the strongest?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan asked seriously.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled faintly: "The Tyrant Saber Slash was a supreme Grand Master saber technique created by past jianghu masters. If cultivated to perfection, it can also reach the pinnacle of the Dao, like the Sun and Moon Fist Technique.</p><p>As for the Heavenly Saber, that is a truly supreme saber technique that I created based on various martial arts.</p><p>If you ask which saber technique is the strongest, then the Heavenly Saber would be the most powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p>Gu Xuan unhesitatingly said: "I hope Father can pass on the Heavenly Saber technique to me!"</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not hesitate, directly pointing out, and a terrifying Heavenly Saber true essence burst forth, instantly surging into Gu Xuan's mind.</p><p>This true essence power was at least ten times stronger than the Sun and Moon True Essence.</p><p></p><p>It took a full hour before Gu Xuan finally emerged from this torrent of true essence.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, he found that although he had obtained the Heavenly Saber technique, there was a strange and mysterious feeling that was difficult to describe, which made Gu Xuan feel somewhat uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng noticed the other's confusion and immediately said, "All martial arts in the world have traceable techniques, but the Heavenly Saber has already transcended the realm of ordinary martial arts. Such martial arts no longer adhere to common techniques, but rather emphasize the comprehension of the Dao of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>I have already planted the seeds of the true meaning of the Heavenly Saber in you. As long as you contemplate and ponder it day and night, you will have the hope of truly grasping the power of the Heavenly Saber."</p><p></p><p>This is the profundity of martial arts at the level of grand masters. Other martial arts, even those of grand master level, all have traceable techniques.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, when various martial arts reach the level of grand masters, they will gradually show signs of breaking free from the constraints of common techniques, but they ultimately fail to take that final step.</p><p></p><p>Only martial arts like the Heavenly Saber, which transcend the grand master level, can truly break through the mundane boundaries. It can be said that such martial arts can no longer be fully expressed in ordinary words, and are more often passed down through the rhythms of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Xuan took a deep breath and bowed respectfully to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Father, for imparting the technique."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, there's no need for too many courtesies. I have already passed on the martial arts that I intended to teach you. As for how much you can master, it depends on your own opportunities and fate."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng waved his hand, allowing the two to leave.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan and Gu Xu left with joyful hearts, one having obtained the true transmission of the Heavenly Saber, and the other having obtained the manual of the Sun and Moon Fist.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been secretly training his troops, and his forces have greatly increased!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has obtained the inheritance of a mysterious grand master, and his strength has improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been guided by a grand master, and his cultivation has improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain a Blood Soul-level Bizarre!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain a Demon Soul-level Bizarre!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Sheng'an' has tempered his physique with innate true qi, and his cultivation has passively broken through to the post-Refine Skin stage!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +5 Improvement Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Sheng'xing' has tempered his physique with innate true qi, and his cultivation has passively broken through to the post-Refine Skin stage!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +5 Improvement Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has broken through to the middle stage of the Wash Marrow Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +150 Improvement Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 200 Wash Marrow Pills!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 100 Refine Viscera Pills!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has gained some understanding of the true meaning of the Heavenly Saber, and his strength has slightly improved."</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xu' has contemplated the grand master's manual, and his strength has slightly improved."</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Yang'er has broken through!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's brow slightly raised.</p><p></p><p>A year has passed since he imparted the supreme techniques to Gu Xuan and Gu Xu, and Gu Yang has now broken through from the initial stage to the middle stage of the Wash Marrow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was naturally satisfied with Gu Yang's breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Over this past year, Gu Qingfeng has been closely monitoring the changes on the information panel and the constant reports from his secret agents.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Qingfeng is also well aware of the changes in Qingyun State.</p><p></p><p>Over the past five to six years, Gu Yang has been fully developing Qingyun State, and after a period of recuperation, the state has regained much of its vitality.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the name "King Guangyang" has truly taken root in the hearts of the people. Not only in Qingyun State, but even in the other eight states, many have heard of the virtuous reputation of King Guangyang and have come to Qingyun State to seek refuge.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Gu Yang's forces have been steadily increasing over these years. The greater the forces, the more resources he can control.</p><p></p><p>Combined with Gu Yang's excellent natural talents, his breakthrough to the middle stage of the Wash Marrow Realm is quite normal.</p><p></p><p>It was only when Gu Qingfeng saw Gu Yang slaying the Bizarres that his expression changed slightly, but he quickly recovered.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Soul-level Bizarre is equivalent to a Wash Marrow Realm cultivator, while the Demon Soul-level Bizarre is comparable to a Refine Viscera Realm cultivator. If this had happened a few years ago when Qingyun State was still in turmoil, these Bizarres would have posed a considerable threat.</p><p></p><p>After all, the more living beings the Bizarres slaughter, the stronger they become.</p><p></p><p>But now, the situation is different. Qingyun State is now internally stable, and these Bizarres pose no significant threat.</p><p></p><p>It is worth mentioning that the number of secret agents has now increased from the original less than a hundred to more than three thousand.</p><p></p><p>The reason for this is that the original three thousand secret agents have received full cultivation support from the Gu Family Manor, and now the weakest among them have broken through to the Refine Bone Realm, while the stronger ones have directly broken through to the Wash Marrow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Qingfeng has already deployed these people far and wide, not only in Qingyun State, but also in the other eight states, providing him with a constant stream of intelligence.</p><p></p><p>In this way, even without leaving his residence, Gu Qingfeng can still grasp the situation throughout the world.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, more news came from the secret agents.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the message in his hand, memorizing the content in a single glance, and then the message turned to dust and scattered.</p><p></p><p>"The situation in the Central State is also about to become clear. The warlord supported by the Divine Sword Sect is indeed formidable, and has managed to occupy such an advantageous position. If nothing unexpected happens, the Central State will likely fall into the hands of that Sword King!"</p><p></p><p>The Sword King is the warlord supported by the Divine Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the various warlords vying for control of the Central State, that Sword King has suppressed the others with his own power, showing signs of dominating the Central State.</p><p></p><p>Once the Central State falls into the Sword King's hands, he will effectively control two states, and the remaining warlords will have no chance of resisting him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the battle for the Central State, all parties have exhausted their full strength. If the Central State is defeated, they will be far from the supreme position.</p><p></p><p>Whoever can occupy the Central State is equivalent to winning half the battle. As long as they can consolidate their forces and conquer the remaining states, they can become the lord of the world.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Gu Qingfeng can be certain that once the Sword King has secured the Central State, his next target will be Qingyun State.</p><p></p><p>The reason is simple. In these past few years, the various states have been in turmoil, with the warlords wasting a large amount of their forces in the Central State. Only Qingyun State, under Gu Yang's leadership, has been recuperating and quietly accumulating strength.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Qingfeng were the Sword King, he would not allow Qingyun State to continue developing either.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, who knows when Gu Yang might just pluck the ripe fruit.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, once the Central State is pacified, the Sword King's target will inevitably be Qingyun State.</p><p></p><p>With this thought in mind, Gu Qingfeng turned his attention back to his own attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>After Gu Yang's breakthrough, the number of his Improvement Points had increased to two hundred and fifty-two, enough to further upgrade the Refine Blood Scripture by two levels.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Gu Qingfeng consumed the two hundred Improvement Points, advancing the Refine Blood Scripture from the fifth level to the seventh level.</p><p></p><p>This time, an overwhelming flood of memories from his cultivation of the Refine Blood Scripture surfaced in Gu Qingfeng's mind, equivalent to hundreds of years of experience.</p><p></p><p>It is clear that for Gu Qingfeng's talent, normally it would have taken him hundreds of years to advance the Refine Blood Scripture from the fifth level to the seventh level.</p><p></p><p>This vast amount of memories flashed through his mind like a panoramic view.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, his physical qi and blood surged and boiled.</p><p></p><p>Advancing two cultivation realms in one go brought about tremendous changes.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying aura of pressure emanated from Gu Qingfeng, covering the vast Whetstone Hall, causing all the divine weapons to tremble slightly, as if submitting to an unparalleled expert.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying qi and blood continued to surge and transform.</p><p></p><p>After a short while, the changes gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng then opened his eyes and exhaled a breath like a fierce gale.</p><p></p><p>"Refine Blood Scripture, seventh level!"</p><p></p><p>"This breakthrough of two cultivation realms in one go has brought about significant changes!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's mind delved into his own body, feeling the changes within. A faint smile appeared on his face, but it soon returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>Although the Refine Blood Scripture had advanced, unfortunately, he still had not reached the pinnacle of the Grand Master Realm.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the two-level advancement of the Refine Blood Scripture was not enough to propel Gu Qingfeng's cultivation to a higher realm.</p><p></p><p>In his view, even if the Refine Blood Scripture reached the eighth level, whether it could truly break through his cultivation remains a question.</p><p></p><p>However, although there was no breakthrough in his cultivation, the growth in his strength was very real.</p><p></p><p>This change satisfied Gu Qingfeng greatly.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 164</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stood holding a sword and shouted in a loud voice, "From this day on, the evil spirits are forbidden to act within the borders of Guangyang Prefecture. Any cultivators within the Guangyang Prefecture are not allowed to harm another person. If anyone disobeys, their entire family will be exterminated!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Gu Qingfeng suddenly swung his sword forward, and a blood-red sword qi slashed across the heavens. The hills crumbled, and a ten-mile-long sword mark was directly carved into the earth, as if it were a natural formation.</p><p></p><p>"Those who are not cultivators of Guangyang Prefecture and dare to trespass this domain, die!" </p><p></p><p>After striking that blow, Gu Qingfeng turned and looked towards the prefecture capital.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the people from various factions changed involuntarily, and an emotion of fear surged in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"I give you all one day to leave Guangyang Prefecture, or else you will end up like the Ancient Revered Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>With these words spoken, the hearts of the crowd sank even further.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that with this move, Gu Qingfeng had completely torn off the mask with the cultivators of the world.</p><p></p><p>Some people had wanted to angrily curse his arrogance, but after seeing the blow that slew the Ancient Revered Heaven and the ten-mile-long sword mark, they forcibly suppressed that impulse.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Ancient Revered Heaven had been killed. Along with him, the evil spirits within his body were also reduced to ashes under that single strike.</p><p></p><p>The rumor that evil spirits could not be destroyed had now been completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>To be able to slay the Ancient Revered Heaven with a single sword strike, Gu Qingfeng's strength in the eyes of these people was absolutely not as simple as that of a Martial Dao Grand Master. Even a True Meaning Grand Master would be incapable of achieving this.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that he was a powerful expert who had broken through the limits of Martial Dao Grand Masters. A supreme expert who could be compared to the Martial Ancestors of the past.</p><p></p><p>In the face of such a powerful figure, the prestige of the immortal sects and noble families seemed to become insignificant.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the foundations of these sects and families, even among the cultivators who had come to Guangyang Prefecture, there was not a single one who could be compared to the Ancient Revered Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Revered Heaven was dead. With Gu Qingfeng's strength, it would be easy for him to drive them all out and kill them.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Gu Qingfeng laid down his stern warning, the cultivators from various factions who had come upon hearing the news dared not linger in Guangyang Prefecture for even a moment.</p><p></p><p>No one believed that Gu Qingfeng was joking.</p><p></p><p>In three days, if they did not leave, they would most likely be completely eliminated here.</p><p></p><p>So these people did not dare to stay.</p><p></p><p>When someone came to the place where the sword mark was, seeing the ten-mile-long ravine before them, with a terrifying sword intent still lingering, they could not help but feel a sense of awe.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Qingfeng the Tyrannical Sword! This person must be the number one martial artist in the world today!"</p><p></p><p>Someone said with a reverent expression.</p><p></p><p>The strike that had slain the Ancient Revered Heaven was now deeply imprinted in their mind. That level of supreme power was completely beyond their ability to match.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the martial dao had fallen into decline, and it was difficult for it to rise again.</p><p></p><p>But now, with Gu Qingfeng emerging from Guangyang Prefecture, everything had changed.</p><p></p><p>A supreme expert who seemed to rival the Martial Ancestors, capable of leading the resurgence of the martial dao, and moreover, he had shattered the legend that evil spirits could not be destroyed. This news, once spread, would shake the entire world.</p><p></p><p>Soon, as the various factions fled Guangyang Prefecture in panic, the events that had occurred here spread like a hurricane throughout the world.</p><p></p><p>In Taishan Commandery, Qingyun State, and even the Nine Provinces of the world, any force that learned of this news was greatly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the world loudly condemned Gu Qingfeng, directly accusing him of being arrogant and defying the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>However, the many martial artists held different views on this matter.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The views of the lower-level martial artists are understandable. The existence of sorcerers and evil spirits seems rather remote to them.</p><p></p><p>However, for those martial artists who have attained a certain level of strength, the existence of sorcerers and evil spirits is no great secret.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao is in decline. This is a universally acknowledged fact. </p><p></p><p>In the past, when the Martial Ancestor spread the martial dao throughout the world, it reached an unprecedented peak. But after the Martial Ancestor's passing, the rise of sorcerers led to the gradual decline of the martial dao. </p><p></p><p>Nowadays, the martial dao in the Nine Provinces has fallen into the sunset, not even a fraction of its former glory.</p><p></p><p>But now, things are different.</p><p></p><p>A supreme expert has emerged from Guangyang Prefecture, one who can stand shoulder to shoulder with the Martial Ancestor. This person openly beheaded the Sect Master of the Celestial Yang Sword Sect, the Ancient Lord Tian, and annihilated all the powerful experts of the Celestial Yang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this person has also shattered the legend of the immortality of evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, all the martial artists in the world regard Gu Qingfeng as the number one figure in the martial dao today. Perhaps the declining martial dao can regain its former brilliance under his guidance.</p><p></p><p>After hearing this news, many martial artists cannot help but set out to make a pilgrimage to Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Yes, a pilgrimage! </p><p></p><p>In their eyes, Gu Qingfeng is the only supreme martial expert since the Martial Ancestor. Calling him a martial dao saint would not be an exaggeration at all.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that Senior Hegemon Blade has attained the divine realm in the martial dao, with a cultivation surpassing the extraordinary. He beheaded the immortal sect master with a single stroke, upholding the might of the martial dao. If I could receive his guidance, it would be an unparalleled opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>"Heh, not just receiving guidance, even just catching a glimpse of such an existence would be the utmost honor!"</p><p></p><p>"That person once struck a blow in front of the Guangyang Prefecture city, and it is said that the unextinguishable blade intent still lingers there. Now, many are heading to Guangyang Prefecture, hoping to comprehend that supreme blade intent!"</p><p></p><p>"What? There is such an opportunity?"</p><p></p><p>"Then what are we waiting for? Let's go together!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, let's go together..."</p><p></p><p>Throughout the Nine Provinces, the topic of discussion is none other than Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>As the majority of martial artists in the world head towards Guangyang Prefecture, the various immortal sects in the Nine Provinces are also deeply angered by this.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Qi Clan.</p><p></p><p>The venerable ancestor of the Qi Clan, who had been in seclusion for a long time, emerged and listened to the report from his subordinates, his expression gloomy like water.</p><p></p><p>"Ancient Lord Tian's strength was not weak, yet the one from Guangyang Prefecture was able to slay him. It seems the martial dao has indeed reached the divine realm. For now, we have no need to engage in direct confrontation with him."</p><p></p><p>"No matter how strong the martial artists are, they can never attain immortality in the end."</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor's martial dao cultivation reached the peak of the great masters, but the result was still just a mere two thousand years before his complete demise."</p><p></p><p>"When this person also meets his demise, the world will still belong to us sorcerers!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the words of the Qi Clan's venerable ancestor, the other Qi Clan members fell silent.</p><p></p><p>This statement.</p><p></p><p>While it may seem that the Qi Clan is not afraid of the Hegemon Blade, in reality, anyone can hear that the Qi Clan's venerable ancestor does not have the confidence to deal with such a powerful expert, and thus plans to wait for him to die out.</p><p></p><p>This news.</p><p></p><p>For the Qi Clan, it is also a considerable blow.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>The facts are as they are.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Clan's foundations are deep and not inferior to the Celestial Yang Sword Sect, but so what? The Celestial Yang Sword Sect was still no match for Gu Qingfeng, and the Qi Clan would be no different.</p><p></p><p>Temporarily avoiding the limelight.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this is the best course of action for now.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

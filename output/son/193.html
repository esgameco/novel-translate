        <h1>Chapter 193</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Swordsman was heading towards the Blood Mountain Manor.</p><p></p><p>With each step he took, his aura became increasingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>The moment the Swordsman stepped into the Blood Mountain Manor, his aura reached its peak.</p><p></p><p>A True Meaning Master!</p><p></p><p>His qi and blood were as mighty as the blazing sun. The Swordsman's gaze towards the depths of the Blood Mountain Manor was resolute, and the dormant battle intent within him had now been fully awakened.</p><p></p><p>Even the iron sword on his back could feel this intense battle intent, and it trembled incessantly.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the sight of countless corpses strewn across the Blood Mountain Manor, the Swordsman's expression turned ice-cold.</p><p></p><p>"The evil entity has harmed my human race, it deserves to be killed!"</p><p></p><p>However, the Swordsman also understood.</p><p></p><p>The evil entity in the Blood Mountain Manor was capable of massacring an entire manor of civilians, so its strength must have reached a terrifying level, far beyond what he could currently handle.</p><p></p><p>After two hundred years of seclusion, the Swordsman had not truly reached the realm of a Grand Master, he was only at the half-step of a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>Being a half-step Grand Master, he was considered a top-tier expert in the martial world. Many evil entities could be directly suppressed by him.</p><p></p><p>But when it came to subduing the evil entity of the Blood Mountain Manor, the Swordsman still lacked the confidence.</p><p></p><p>Because he was well aware of how powerful the evil entity was.</p><p></p><p>Five hundred years ago, the Swordsman had not participated in the previous battle, as he had not yet been born at that time. But his master, the founding patriarch of the Iron Sword Sect, had once taken part in that battle.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Iron Sword Sect's patriarch had returned severely injured, and after teaching the Swordsman for some time, he passed away due to the unhealing wounds.</p><p></p><p>Precisely because the Swordsman understood the strength of the Blood Mountain Manor's evil entity, he had no intention of suppressing it with his own power.</p><p></p><p>His only goal was to delay it for some time.</p><p></p><p>As he delved deeper into the Blood Mountain Manor, the aura of the evil entity grew increasingly dense.</p><p></p><p>The Swordsman's expression became increasingly grave.</p><p></p><p>When he arrived before a certain mountain range, he saw that all the trees had withered, the ground had cracked, and a sinister and chilling aura permeated the air.</p><p></p><p>When the Swordsman looked at the gaping crevices in the earth, the endless darkness within them seemed like a devouring abyss that instilled fear, and the scattered corpses were arranged in a bizarre manner, their blood and essence completely drained.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the Swordsman's expression turned furious.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Sacrifice!"</p><p></p><p>"Someone has used the blood of the civilians to perform a blood sacrifice, which has led to the awakening of this evil entity!"</p><p></p><p>Before entering the Blood Mountain Manor, the Swordsman had thought that the evil entity had simply awakened due to the prolonged sealing, but now he realized that its resurgence was deliberately orchestrated.</p><p></p><p>And when he saw the attire worn by some of the corpses, the Swordsman's gaze turned cold once more.</p><p></p><p>"The Heaven Yang Sword Sect... the Fei family, they have the audacity to act in such a manner!"</p><p></p><p>Although he was not clear about the full details, seeing the bodies of the two sects among the many civilian corpses, the Swordsman could easily deduce the connection.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, the two sects had intended to use a blood sacrifice to awaken the evil entity here.</p><p></p><p>But it seemed they had miscalculated.</p><p></p><p>The evil entity had awakened and slaughtered the members of both sects.</p><p></p><p>And now it was poised to sweep across the entire Blood Mountain Manor, massacring all the civilians.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Swordsman noticed a figure in blue robes, and he couldn't help but be taken aback. He then spoke, "The evil entity has awakened in this place, sir, you should not linger here.</p><p></p><p>Given the strength of this evil entity, even Grand Masters would find it difficult to withstand. It is best for you to leave now, while there is still a chance to survive!"</p><p></p><p>In the Swordsman's view, the person in blue robes had likely sensed the disturbance in the Blood Mountain Manor and come to investigate. Although the Swordsman could not discern the depth of the other's abilities, he reckoned that even a powerful cultivator would not be a match for the evil entity.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Swordsman's words, Gu Qingfeng turned his head and looked at him with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>"If you know the evil entity is so formidable, why have you come here?"</p><p></p><p>"The Iron Sword Sect's principle is to eradicate evil entities. Now that an evil entity has awakened in the Blood Mountain Manor, how could I, as an elder of the sect, not come? I see that you, though young, have a remarkable aura. It would be a pity for you to perish here. It is better for you to leave while you still can."</p><p></p><p>The Swordsman had lived for centuries, and although he could not discern the full extent of Gu Qingfeng's abilities, he could tell that the young man was not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Swordsman, Gu Qingfeng was still a junior.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the Swordsman's words, Gu Qingfeng's expression shifted slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Iron Sword Sect! He had heard of this sect before.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the current world, truly pure martial arts sects were few and far between. The Iron Sword Sect was a prominent sect in the Southern Yang Prefecture, with a Xian-tier Patriarch at its helm, so Gu Qingfeng was not unfamiliar with it.</p><p></p><p>However, it seemed that the Iron Sword Sect's foundations were stronger than the rumors suggested.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, the cultivator before him was no weak individual.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Qingfeng's eyes, the Swordsman's aura was powerful, comparable to that of the Sect Master of the Divine Might Sect.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the man was a half-step Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>And furthermore, he was a half-step Grand Master who had attained the True Meaning, not just a regular half-step Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Regarding the strongest ones, </p><p></p><p>It is the combination of true qi and blood essence that has achieved the realm of a half-step grand master.</p><p></p><p>It is clear.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Cultivator belongs to the third category.</p><p></p><p>Just as the two were conversing, the earth trembled, and suddenly a blood-red light shot up into the sky. A terrifying aura rose from the depths of the earth, and a blood-stained golden coffin appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>The blood-stained coffin was violently shaking, with golden chains forged to seal it, but now most of these chains had been shattered, and the evil entity sealed within was about to emerge.</p><p></p><p>"The evil entity of the Blood Mountain Mansion!"</p><p></p><p>"Even gold can barely seal it completelyâ€”"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Cultivator's face was filled with horror.</p><p></p><p>Now, even without anyone breaking the seal, it would be difficult to completely restrain this evil entity.</p><p></p><p>Breaking the seal and emerging.</p><p></p><p>It is only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>It is known that gold can suppress evil entities, a fact recognized since ancient times. No matter how powerful the evil entity, it would be difficult to truly break through such sealing power.</p><p></p><p>But now, </p><p></p><p>The evil entity of the Blood Mountain Mansion has the ability to shatter the golden seal, indicating that this evil entity is quite special, either its strength has reached a terrifying level that even gold cannot restrain, or some other possibility.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the reason, the current situation has plunged the Sword Dao Cultivator's heart and mind into the abyss.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression, on the other hand, remained relatively calm as he looked at the evil entity before them.</p><p></p><p>"Boom! Boom!!"</p><p></p><p>The thunderous sounds came from the golden coffin, and under their influence, the Sword Dao Cultivator felt his heart losing control, and his entire qi and blood were about to reverse flow, causing his complexion to change again.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, </p><p></p><p>The remaining chains broke.</p><p></p><p>The massive golden coffin began to crack, and a chilling, eerie aura seeped out. In the next breath, the coffin lid shattered, and a towering force surged into the sky, shaking the heavens and changing their color.</p><p></p><p>Then, a skeletal being crawled out of the coffin, and a vast, blood-red power rushed and converged into the skeleton.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after,</p><p></p><p>Flesh and blood began to regenerate.</p><p></p><p>The meridians and physical body reappeared.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, the skeletal being had reconstituted its flesh and blood form. Its eyes were blood-red, and when it looked at the Sword Dao Cultivator and Gu Qingfeng, a sinister and ferocious expression appeared on its monstrous face.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The evil entity spoke in a hoarse and unpleasant voice. When its massive hand descended towards the Sword Dao Cultivator, the terrifying might caused a turbulent blood aura mixed with a chilling essence to permeate the heavens and earth, making the Sword Dao Cultivator feel as if his qi and blood had completely stagnated.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, you should leave first. I will hold it back!"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Cultivator's face was filled with horror, but his robust physique and surging blood qi forcefully dispersed the incoming cold aura. Suddenly, the iron sword on his back was unsheathed.</p><p></p><p>The moment he gripped the sword hilt, the Sword Dao Cultivator's aura changed.</p><p></p><p>"Myriad Sword Technique!"</p><p></p><p>A torrential blood qi surged into the iron sword, and an extremely powerful sword intent slashed through the sky and the earth. As the Sword Dao Cultivator unleashed his strike, countless sword qi bombarded outwards like a thunderous assault.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike,</p><p></p><p>Was the Sword Dao Cultivator's most pinnacle technique after two hundred years of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Even the space itself was covered in dense cracks under the power of this strike.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad," Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>While the Sword Dao Cultivator was only a half-step grand master, the power of this sword strike could rival that of a true martial dao grand master.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>To deal with this evil entity, it was still a bit lacking.</p><p></p><p>As expected,</p><p></p><p>When the power of the Myriad Sword Technique collided with the evil entity's power, the former was annihilated like sweeping away withered branches and leaves. The surging might sent the Sword Dao Cultivator's body flying.</p><p></p><p>If not for his robust foundation, he would have perished on the spot from just that one strike.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the Sword Dao Cultivator was severely injured, coughing up blood, and his eyes were filled with horror when looking at the evil entity.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after,</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Cultivator's expression became resolute, as if he had made a decision.</p><p></p><p>"Even if I die today, I will make you pay the price!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke,</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Cultivator was about to unleash a secret technique, making a final desperate attempt.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Just as the Sword Dao Cultivator was about to act, the previously inactive Gu Qingfeng slowly spoke, "It is not yet time to risk your life. Why the hurry, sir?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Cultivator was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>But before he could ask, he saw Gu Qingfeng unleash a punch. The seemingly simple strike caused the heavens and earth to seemingly collapse, with a terrifying power that seemed capable of shattering the void. The robust and brilliant blood qi was like a divine sun.</p><p></p><p>All the eerie, cold aura in the air was now dissipating, and the evil entity let out a furious roar, with a blood sea phantom emerging from behind it, rushing to engulf and suppress Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment,</p><p></p><p>The blood sea was torn apart.</p><p></p><p>The ferocious punch heavily struck the evil entity, blasting its physical body away, causing its flesh to explode and revealing the stark white bones within.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Cultivator was dumbfounded, his face filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Such blood qi... truly unimaginable!!"</p><p></p><p>He considered himself a qi and blood master, with a robust blood qi, but now, compared to Gu Qingfeng's blood qi, it was like the difference between a firefly and the bright moon.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Cultivator was greatly shaken.</p>

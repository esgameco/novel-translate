        <h1>Chapter 212</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When Shi Zhen received this news, his expression was somewhat stunned.</p><p></p><p>He had just received Gu Yang's order and was preparing to lead troops to eliminate the Wanshun Sect, but before he could act, the Wanshun Sect had already been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The scout respectfully said, "Reporting to the general, there is news that on that day, the Heavenly Sword Dao descended from the azure sky, not only wiping out the Wanshun Sect, but also completely shattering the mountain gate where it was located."</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Sword Dao..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the words of his subordinate, Shi Zhen's expression slightly changed.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have thought of something.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the swordsman said, "This description sounds like the work of Senior Gu. In the world, only Senior Gu would have the power to instantly destroy a top-tier sect."</p><p></p><p>"The swordsman is right!" </p><p></p><p>Shi Zhen nodded, agreeing with the swordsman's analysis.</p><p></p><p>From the current situation, it was indeed likely that this was the work of Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>However, to confirm this matter, Shi Zhen still decided to personally go to the Wanshun Sect.</p><p></p><p>He saw that the Wanshun Sect had now become a ruin, with the mountains and valleys collapsed, and terrifying sword marks engraved on the earth, emanating a chilling sword intent.</p><p></p><p>"The aura remaining here is indeed very similar to Senior Gu's."</p><p></p><p>The swordsman, upon seeing the sword marks, immediately determined that Gu Qingfeng was the one who had destroyed the Wanshun Sect.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, the swordsman also felt that this was reasonable.</p><p></p><p>The prince of the royal household had been assassinated, undoubtedly touching this person's taboo, so Gu Qingfeng personally acted to destroy the Wanshun Sect, which could also be justified.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, this also indirectly showed that Gu Qingfeng valued the prince greatly.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Gu Qingfeng would not have personally taken action against the Wanshun Sect.</p><p></p><p>After all, according to the swordsman's understanding, Gu Qingfeng mostly stayed in the Gu family manor and rarely interfered in the affairs of the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>Each time he acted, it was related to the future of the Gu family and the Prince of Guangyang.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Shi Zhen reported this news back.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning that Gu Qingfeng had personally destroyed the Wanshun Sect, Gu Yang also felt relieved and then smiled.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Father values Xing'er and the others quite a lot!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Zhong Li also smiled cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Qingfeng was willing to value her children, Zhong Li was naturally happy.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Qingfeng's heirs were not just Gu Yang alone.</p><p></p><p>As the queen consort, Zhong Li increasingly understood Gu Qingfeng's current status and position.</p><p></p><p>Although he appeared to be only the manor master of the Gu family manor, he was actually the strongest expert in the world. If one could gain his favor, the benefits would be considerable.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Gu Yang said, "In a year or two, when Xing'er and the others are a little older and reach the age of martial arts training, I plan to send them back to the Gu family manor, so that Father can personally guide and teach them."</p><p></p><p>"If Father is willing, that would be the best." Zhong Li nodded, naturally having no intention to refuse.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang smiled and said, "Don't worry, Father will not refuse."</p><p></p><p>Gu Shengnan had been cultivating by Gu Qingfeng's side for these years, and Gu Yang had also seen this.</p><p></p><p>His own daughter was young in age, but her cultivation was already comparable to many renowned figures in the jianghu. Even Gu Yang had to admit that at her age, his own cultivation was far inferior to hers.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had no doubt that if Gu Shengnan was given more time, her cultivation could surpass his own.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Yang's view, this was not only due to Gu Shengnan's talent, but also inevitably due to Gu Qingfeng's guidance.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>More forces bowed their heads.</p><p></p><p>In less than a month.</p><p></p><p>The entire Lingzhou had completely fallen under Gu Yang's control.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>The situation in the Central State was also progressing at a similar pace.</p><p></p><p>It can be said.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's current status is that he now controls three states, with an army of not less than ten million under his command.</p><p></p><p>Swallowing the world like a tiger!</p><p></p><p>Anyone with clear eyes can see that this world will surely become the world of the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>Even though so far, there are still six states that have not fallen into Gu Yang's hands, but this is only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>After all, with three states under his control and an army of millions, there is no one in the six states who can contend with Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>Since the various immortal sects and powerful families that supported the regional lords have been destroyed, the so-called regional lords in the various states are now just taking advantage of the chaos to rebel and declare themselves kings, not worthy of much attention.</p><p></p><p>These regional lords, even if they have an army of over 100,000, are still very few in number.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>The powerful figures from the various immortal sects and powerful families, led by the Xian State's Ji family, all went to Guangyang Prefecture to meet Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't long before.</p><p></p><p>The powerful figures of the various forces left with unhappy expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>What was discussed between the two parties, no one knows.</p><p></p><p>But after these powerful figures returned, in less than a few days, they publicly announced their recognition of Gu Yang's position.</p><p></p><p>This result.</p><p></p><p>Has made Gu Yang's prestige even greater.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang also personally went to the Gu family manor to meet Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Son pays respects to his father!"</p><p></p><p>In the main hall of the Gu family manor, Gu Yang, dressed in brocade robes, had a noble and imposing aura, but in front of Gu Qingfeng, he still had a humble demeanor, completely suppressing his kingly aura.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the person in front of him, his expression slightly emotional.</p><p></p><p>When he had brought the other back in the past, it felt like it was just yesterday.</p><p></p><p>The little brat who used to follow behind him has now truly grown up, and in the future will become the hegemon of the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic thoughts dissipated, and Gu Qingfeng said, "Sit down and let's talk."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang cupped his hands and then sat down in the lower seat.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "I heard you have made a covenant with those immortal sects and powerful families?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang frankly admitted.</p><p></p><p>"Recently, the various major powers led by the Xian State's Ji family all came to the royal manor. Their original intention was to hope to maintain a peaceful coexistence with my Guangyang Royal Manor.</p><p></p><p>They supported me in ascending the throne, but they also need to be given special privileges for these sect and family powers, maintaining their lofty status from the previous dynasty, without being arbitrarily suppressed."</p><p></p><p>"How did you respond to their demands?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly, and then asked again.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the demands of these sect families, Gu Qingfeng was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the past dynasties, it was these sect families that controlled things behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>The so-called hegemon of the dynasty was just a tool they supported.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>All along.</p><p></p><p>These immortal sects and powerful families have been transcendent, above the imperial power.</p><p></p><p>But the problem is, Gu Yang does not have the backing of these immortal sects and powerful families. If he ascends the throne, whether he can maintain their previous status is debatable.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>They came to him with such demands, which was naturally reasonable.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang snorted and said, "Since when did the world of the Gu family allow them to interfere? Moreover, the sorcerers have brought calamity to the world, and I have not completely uprooted all these sect families, which is already the limit of my benevolence.</p><p></p><p>So I did not agree to the demands of these sect families."</p><p></p><p>"The main content of the covenant I made with them is that in the future when the Gu family rules the world, the foundations and inheritances of these sect families can be preserved.</p><p></p><p>But as a condition, they are also not allowed to wantonly slaughter the common people and attempt to cultivate evil arts with the blood and flesh of living beings!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Qingfeng looked at the person in front of him and calmly said, "With such demands, as long as I am alive, I believe they will not dare to refuse.</p><p></p><p>But if one day I am no longer here, these sect families may become a great hidden danger."</p><p></p><p>"This is something I am well aware of, but if I can truly sit on that position one day, why would I fear these sect families?</p><p></p><p>And Father has perfected the martial dao, the problem of the short lifespan of martial artists is no longer an issue.</p><p></p><p>As long as I am given time, the path of sorcery will surely decline.</p><p></p><p>It may not take a hundred years, and the martial dao will flourish, while sorcery will be completely extinguished!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said confidently.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>This approach also has its own hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>Martial artists violating the law.</p><p></p><p>If the martial dao becomes too powerful, it may not necessarily be a good thing in the future.</p><p></p><p>But this is a matter for another time.</p><p></p><p>Now, in order to contend against the path of sorcery, the only way is to strengthen the martial dao. The root cause of the calamity in this world lies in the evil spirits and sorcerers.</p><p></p><p>As long as these problems are solved, the subsequent problems will be much simpler.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore.</p><p></p><p>Governing the world is like cooking a small fish, it cannot be rushed.</p><p></p><p>These thoughts, Gu Yang did not hide from Gu Qingfeng, but directly expressed them in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Now as the King of Guangyang, many of Gu Yang's thoughts are deeply buried in his heart. Even his closest confidants or even his bedmate cannot hear them without reservation.</p><p></p><p>Only in front of Gu Qingfeng can Gu Yang truly let go of all the shackles and constraints on his heart and speak freely.</p><p></p><p>"To have such thoughts, Father is very pleased!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's gaze was filled with approval. The year he loosened his control over Gu Yang and allowed him to grow on his own, it seems he did not make a mistake.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if he had kept Gu Yang confined within the Gu family manor, it would have been difficult for him to achieve today's accomplishments.</p><p></p><p>Later.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also said, "Those sect families agreed to your conditions, perhaps also because of the short lifespan of martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Although martial artists cannot live forever, as long as Father is alive, I will not allow them to cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>If anyone dares to violate the rules, then they will be destroyed."</p><p></p><p>These words.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said lightly.</p><p></p><p>As if destroying an immortal sect family was a simple and easy task for him.</p><p></p><p>In fact.</p><p></p><p>This is indeed the case.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng, the number one in this world, is truly a peerless number one.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that currently there are no transcendent experts from these sect families, even if there were, Gu Qingfeng could suppress them with his bare hands, naturally not allowing these forces to stir up any trouble.</p><p></p><p>The reason he has not directly taken action is because these sect families are deeply rooted, and recklessly taking action may cause some chaos.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Yang has the intention of slowly boiling the frog, Gu Qingfeng naturally will not take direct action.</p><p></p><p>"There is another matter that I would like to consult Father about!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Yang suddenly spoke, and then took out a jade slip, handing it to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"This jade slip is something I unexpectedly obtained in Lingzhou. It records some incredible things, and I am unable to determine the authenticity at the moment."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took the jade slip, his expression slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>With his eyesight, he could see that the jade slip in front of him was not simple, as it had a faint and mysterious aura flowing through it.</p><p></p><p>After observing the jade slip for a moment, Gu Qingfeng tried to infuse it with his true qi and blood energy, but they all seemed to sink into the void without any reaction.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Gu Yang said, "This jade slip needs to be pressed against the forehead to obtain the information within."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Qingfeng followed the instructions and did so.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he pressed the jade slip against his forehead, a surge of information came rushing out.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had completely digested all the information.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Forging the Immortal Court!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>This information was a cultivation method, or more accurately, a secret technique.</p><p></p><p>Forging the Immortal Court.</p><p></p><p>This is the name of this secret technique.</p><p></p><p>According to the records, the dynasties of the world are divided into three, six, and nine grades, with the royal dynasty being the lowest, and above it are the imperial dynasty, the divine dynasty, the immortal dynasty, and the highest, the Immortal Court.</p><p></p><p>This secret technique records the methods of forging the Immortal Court.</p><p></p><p>Even with Gu Qingfeng's vision, when he saw such a secret technique, his expression was slightly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said, "Based on the inheritance recorded in the jade slip, this method is truly profound. I have never seen it before, and as for the method of forging the Immortal Court recorded above, I believe its authenticity is at least 70%."</p><p></p><p>"If what is recorded here is true, then where does this secret technique of forging the Immortal Court come from?"</p><p></p><p>"Taking a step back, did an ancient Immortal Court exist in the Nine States in the distant past?"</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, if the Immortal Court truly exists, then with the current situation in the Nine States, it would be difficult to support the existence of an Immortal Court. </p><p></p><p>In that case, does it mean that there is an even broader world beyond the Nine States?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang expressed the doubts that he had long kept hidden in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Some things.</p><p></p><p>He already had some guesses.</p><p></p><p>But guesses are still guesses, and Gu Yang was not sure about the actual facts.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, regarding these matters, Gu Yang had not mentioned them to anyone else.</p><p></p><p>There's no way.</p><p></p><p>The matter of forging the Immortal Court is too important.</p><p></p><p>Once it is leaked out, no one knows what kind of chaos it will cause.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang came to see Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>This time, his purpose was not only related to the various immortal sects and powerful families, but also to clarify the authenticity of forging the Immortal Court.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Qingfeng pondered for a moment, then slowly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"If Father is not mistaken, forging the Immortal Court should be real, and this world is not as simple as what we see now.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, there are heavens beyond heavens, and there may be a much broader world beyond the Nine States."</p><p></p><p>"But Father believes that these matters are not what you should be considering for now. Even if there is a broader world beyond the Nine States, that is a matter for the future.</p><p></p><p>What you need to do now is first unify the Nine States."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, according to the method of forging the Immortal Court, condensing the aura of a dynasty will greatly benefit the ruler. When you eventually establish your dominance over the Nine States, you can follow this method."</p><p></p><p>"Some things, when your strength has reached a high enough level, all problems will be easily solved."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's words made Gu Yang's heart feel relieved. The doubts and troubles that had been suppressed in his heart for a long time have now dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Qingfeng said it's fine, then it must be correct.</p><p></p><p>In that case.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang does not need to worry about so much.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 187</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"According to the intelligence of the secret guards, Nangong Yu has become extremely close to the Pei family."</p><p></p><p>"When Pei Jing initially established himself as the king and suppressed the three commanderies, he also received the support of Nangong Yu."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi's words did not come as a surprise to Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>After all, when Pei Jing was in his prime, with a large army under his command, the court forces were nearly wiped out. The people of the Zhenxie Mansion had no choice but to cooperate with Pei Jing in order to remain in Nanyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>It was only after Pei Jing's demise that the Taixuan Dynasty seized the opportunity to regain control over Nanyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>However, even then, the court was unable to fully control the entire Nanyang Prefecture, but only managed to hold sway over half of it.</p><p></p><p>As the ancient saying goes, "If that is the case, then Nangong Yu's assassination of the king may be related to the Pei family."</p><p></p><p>"This is only natural," Gu Yang scoffed.</p><p></p><p>"With Pei Jing's death, my royal self has long been at odds with the Pei family. If the Pei family had not made any moves, that would have been the unusual thing."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was not at all surprised that the Pei family might have been the ones who instigated Nangong Yu to take action.</p><p></p><p>After all, if this was indeed the Pei family's doing, then everything would make sense.</p><p></p><p>The Pei family controlled Nanyang Prefecture. Even if the incident with Pei Jing had not occurred, with the Guangyang Army invading Nanyang Prefecture, the Pei family could not have simply ignored it.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, Gu Yang said, "The Tianyang Sword Sect is now a problem. The secret guards should keep a close eye on them. As an immortal sect, the Tianyang Sword Sect certainly cannot just sit idly by!"</p><p></p><p>Since his arrival in Nanyang Prefecture, the Tianyang Sword Sect had only dispatched one sect master to assassinate him, and then there had been no further activity.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Yang's view, this was unreasonable. The Tianyang Sword Sect hated him to the core, so how could their actions be so feeble?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as an immortal sect, the Tianyang Sword Sect's resources could not be as simple as just one sect master.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the more silent the Tianyang Sword Sect remained, the more uneasy Gu Yang felt.</p><p></p><p>"My subordinates have already stationed people to keep an eye on the Tianyang Sword Sect. I believe that any movement by the Tianyang Sword Sect will not escape the notice of the secret guards!" Gu Yi said, cupping his fist.</p><p></p><p>But before long, a secret guard scout hurriedly reported, "Your Majesty, a secret guard has brought a letter from the Tianyang Sword Sect. Please take a look."</p><p></p><p>The scout handed the confidential letter to Gu Yang, who opened it and frowned deeply after reading it.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang then passed the letter down, saying in a cold voice, "You all should take a look as well."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Yang's gloomy expression, many of the generals exchanged glances, a sense of gravity visible in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>As the letter was passed around, someone suddenly burst out angrily, "The Tianyang Sword Sect is so ruthless!"</p><p></p><p>"These immortal sects are truly the parasites of the world!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the curses, Gu Yun also looked at the letter that had reached him, his expression darkening as well.</p><p></p><p>"Exterminate the city!" he exclaimed. "The Tianyang Sword Sect's actions cannot be tolerated!"</p><p></p><p>The letter revealed that the Tianyang Sword Sect had colluded with the Pei family to jointly massacre the civilians as a sacrifice.</p><p></p><p>Although these events were carried out in secret, there is no truly impenetrable wall in this world. When someone managed to escape, the news naturally leaked out. Even if the Tianyang Sword Sect later silenced those who knew, the secret guards had already obtained the information and reported it back.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It is said that five hundred years ago, a calamitous evil entity emerged in the Blood Mountain Prefecture, ravaging the entire region and causing the deaths of countless lives, including many prominent clans and sects."</p><p></p><p>"Until later, the powerful cultivators of the Tianyang Sword Sect joined forces with the Exorcism Bureau to pay a great price and barely manage to seal that evil entity within the Blood Mountain Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>"Now, the Tianyang Sword Sect is sacrificing the common people of various cities, likely with the intention of a scorched-earth policy!"</p><p></p><p>After his outburst, Gu Zhen's expression calmed down as he revealed some secrets from five hundred years ago.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary people, five hundred years is already several lifetimes, so there are not many who truly understand the events of that ancient era.</p><p></p><p>But the Shenwu Sect is different.</p><p></p><p>As an ancient martial dao sect, the Shenwu Sect has records of all the major events that have occurred across the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the incident in the Blood Mountain Prefecture was a huge commotion, with the emergence of a calamitous evil entity.</p><p></p><p>After all, even the weakest calamitous evil entities are comparable to the existence of True Meaning Sect Masters, and the powerful ones can be on par with great Dao Masters or even Transcendent Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The truly top-tier calamitous evil entities may even be superior to Transcendent Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Just like the evil Buddha from the Nine Turns Path in Guangyang Prefecture back then.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Zhen's opinion, that evil Buddha was at least comparable to the pinnacle of Transcendent Cultivators, or even stronger.</p><p></p><p>Now, the evil entity in the Blood Mountain Prefecture, even if not as powerful as the evil Buddha, is likely not far behind. If this evil entity were to awaken, it would undoubtedly be a great calamity.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression turned icy cold: "It seems the Tianyang Sword Sect intends to scorch the earth!"</p><p></p><p>"But unfortunately, I am not the type to compromise. The Tianyang Sword Sect and the Pei family's massacre of the cities, I will definitely not let them off lightly."</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful the evil entity in the Blood Mountain Prefecture might be, Gu Yang was not afraid, for he had the backing of Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>The Demon-Slaying Sword he carried was Gu Yang's greatest trump card.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the two sides were already locked in a life-and-death struggle.</p><p></p><p>Even if Gu Yang felt apprehensive, he could only muster all his strength to annihilate the Tianyang Sword Sect and the Pei family.</p><p></p><p>"Immediately issue orders to the other armies to quicken their pace, but for now, avoid the Pei family, the Tianyang Sword Sect, and the Blood Mountain Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>In the end, Gu Yang gave another order.</p><p></p><p>The Tianyang Sword Sect, the Pei family, and the Blood Mountain Prefecture were not opponents that the other armies could handle.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the hundred-thousand-strong army divided into multiple routes, dealing with the other rebel forces would not be a problem, but facing these three powers would still be insufficient.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Yang's view, he would have to personally lead the army to confront them.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, you all shall immediately prepare, and await my command to directly attack the Tianyang Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said in a stern voice, and the many generals saluted and left.</p><p></p><p>After the others had departed, Gu Yang only kept Gu Yi behind.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Yi, you must immediately send a messenger pigeon to inform my father of the current situation in Nanyang Prefecture. Any news, have the hidden guards there transmit it back immediately!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's calm demeanor from earlier had now become much more serious.</p><p></p><p>The news of the massacre, the sealed evil entity in the Blood Mountain Prefecture - all of this indicated that the Tianyang Sword Sect was intent on a scorched-earth policy.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of caution, Gu Yang had to relay this information back, so that Gu Qingfeng would be aware of the situation.</p>

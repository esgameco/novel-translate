        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In front of a certain palace, there were two monks facing off.</p><p></p><p>"Young one, hand over the elixir in your possession, and this lord will spare your life. Otherwise, even if you have an ancient weapon to protect you, you will still meet your demise!"</p><p></p><p>Qu Peng looked at the Gu Xuan before him, his expression a mix of greed, disdain, and a hint of wariness towards the Zhu Xie Dao (Dao of Extermination Blade).</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, a cultivator at the fifth layer of the Refining Impurity Realm was merely an insignificant ant.</p><p></p><p>But surprisingly, this ant had obtained an elixir from the palace before him, which had piqued Qu Peng's intense interest.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was a secret realm left behind by the Great Saint of Tian Feng, and the elixir within the palace must have been left by the Great Saint himself.</p><p></p><p>One must know that after tens of thousands of years of evolution, many elixirs have turned to dust, and the ones that have been preserved are extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>If it were an ordinary Refining Impurity Realm cultivator, Qu Peng would not have wasted time talking and would have already seized the elixir.</p><p></p><p>But—</p><p></p><p>Qu Peng's gaze fell upon the Zhu Xie Dao on Gu Xuan's back, and there was obvious wariness in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He had witnessed with his own eyes a Realm of Divine Transformation Ninth Layer expert being slain directly by this divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>Qu Peng was deeply wary of the power of this divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Xuan's expression remained cold: "The treasures of the secret realm are obtained through one's own fortune. For you to expect me to hand over the elixir is simply impossible.</p><p></p><p>I do not wish to fight with you, sir. If you retreat now, we can part ways peacefully. Otherwise, the blade in my hand may not be as merciful!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Qu Peng's expression fluctuated.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, his greed completely overwhelmed his wariness, and he stepped forward, summoning an ancient pagoda that swiftly descended upon Gu Xuan, intent on crushing him.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you have an ancient weapon, what of it? Do you truly think this lord has no means to deal with you!"</p><p></p><p>"Since you refuse to be spared, then prepare to die—"</p><p></p><p>Qu Peng's expression was ferocious, as if he had already seen the sight of Gu Xuan being crushed by him.</p><p></p><p>As the ancient pagoda descended, its terrifying pressure caused Gu Xuan's blood to stagnate. But at that moment, a powerful and majestic aura of the Dao suddenly erupted from behind him.</p><p></p><p>In the next instant, the divine blade was unsheathed.</p><p></p><p>The bone-chilling Dao Qi slashed through the void, shattering the ancient pagoda. The lingering force swept towards Qu Peng, causing his expression to change drastically.</p><p></p><p>"This is not an ancient weapon... but... but the will of a Demigod..."</p><p></p><p>Qu Peng tried to flee, but the Dao Qi had already covered him, and he could only watch helplessly as the divine blade descended.</p><p></p><p>At the last moment, Qu Peng calmed down, his gaze towards Gu Xuan filled with resentment.</p><p></p><p>"Young one, even if I die, you will have to pay the price—"</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, Qu Peng was ruthlessly cleaved in half by the Zhu Xie Dao.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Xuan's expression did not show any joy, for he noticed that Qu Peng had seemingly cast a secret technique before his death, and a mysterious pattern had appeared on the back of his hand, like a parasitic worm that could not be removed.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I have been targeted by the forces behind Qu Peng!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan's brow furrowed, but then he relaxed. At this point, there was no need to worry further. Given the situation just now, even if he had handed over the elixir, Qu Peng would not have spared him.</p><p></p><p>So, only one of them could survive.</p><p></p><p>As for what would happen after slaying Qu Peng, he would deal with it later.</p><p></p><p>"For now, I should leave this place."</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan immediately turned and departed.</p><p></p><p>Soon, other cultivators arrived, drawn by the commotion. Upon seeing the horrific scene and Qu Peng's bisected corpse, they were shocked.</p><p></p><p>"This is a true disciple of the Feather Transformation Holy Land!"</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, he died here."</p><p></p><p>"I heard this one was the scion of a Peak Lord of the Dao Palace Realm in the Feather Transformation Holy Land. With his death here, there will surely be a great stir..."</p><p></p><p>Many recognized Qu Peng's identity, for as a true disciple of the Feather Transformation Holy Land, he had reached the Realm of Divine Transformation Ninth Layer at a young age, and his future ascension to the Dao Palace Realm was a foregone conclusion.</p><p></p><p>In the great age of strife, he would have been a promising seedling on the path to Sainthood.</p><p></p><p>Yet, he had met his demise here.</p><p></p><p>The death of a Dao Palace Realm scion at this location would undoubtedly cause a significant upheaval once the news spread.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Feather Transformation Holy Land, within a certain palace, an elderly man in black robes was in a meditative state. Suddenly, he opened his sharp, eagle-like eyes, and a trace of coldness appeared on his gaunt face.</p><p></p><p>"What has happened? Why do I have this ominous premonition?"</p><p></p><p>Qu Hua Dao's brow furrowed, his expression slightly unsettled.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a disciple from the Sword Peak rushed in, his face filled with panic.</p><p></p><p>"Peak Lord, a grave matter has occurred..."</p><p></p><p>"What is it that you are so anxious about!" Qu Hua Dao's aura turned cold, causing the disciple to calm down slightly.</p><p></p><p>The disciple swallowed hard and stammered, "Qu... Qu Peng's soul token... it has been shattered!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, a terrifying power erupted, and Qu Hua Dao instantly appeared before the disciple, grabbing his neck with fury.</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?"</p><p></p><p>"Qu... Qu Peng..."</p><p></p><p>The disciple's face turned red, his eyes filled with fear, struggling to speak.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, he felt the grip on his neck loosen, and when he looked around, Qu Hua Dao had vanished.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, a terrifying aura burst forth from the Sword Peak, shaking the entire Feather Transformation Holy Land. The Peak Lords and Elders from the various peaks were all drawn by this aura, gazing towards the Sword Peak.</p><p></p><p>"What is that old fool Qu Hua Dao raging about again?"</p><p></p><p>"Whew, such a powerful sword intent. It seems his cultivation has progressed significantly, and it won't be long before he reaches the Demigod Realm."</p><p></p><p>Some were frowning, while others were amazed by the display of Qu Hua Dao's strength.</p><p></p><p>In the Feather Transformation Holy Land, the Sword Peak was renowned for its prowess.</p><p></p><p>As the Peak Lord of the Sword Peak, Qu Hua Dao's cultivation was truly formidable.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the hall where the soul tokens were stored, Qu Peng's token had been completely shattered, and Qu Hua Dao's expression was twisted with cold-blooded murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"Who, who is the one that killed my son!"</p><p></p><p>"If I find out, I will ensure you meet a fate worse than death!"</p><p></p><p>Qu Hua Dao's expression turned savage. At his level of cultivation, leaving behind a successor was no easy feat. Even though there were ancient methods to conceive offspring, they were of limited use for cultivators of his caliber.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ever since Qu Peng was born, Qu Huadao has always held him in the palm of his hand, afraid of him getting hurt or bumped into. For this biological heir, he would do anything to help.</p><p></p><p>Qu Peng was able to reach the ninth level of the Divine Transformation Realm at a young age, and had a reputation as a genius in the Eastern Domain. This was not only due to his own innate talent, but also because Qu Huadao spared no effort in cultivating him.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>Qu Peng is dead.</p><p></p><p>This has turned all of Qu Huadao's years of persistence into ashes.</p><p></p><p>Such a strong sense of disappointment, how could it not enrage the Peak Master of the Sword Peak?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a figure suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>When Qu Huadao saw the newcomer, his ferocious expression eased up slightly as he cupped his hands and said, "Greetings, Holy Master!"</p><p></p><p>"News has come that a great holy secret realm has appeared in the Nine Provinces, so you shall go to the Nine Provinces in place of the Holy Land."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Master of Feather Transformation spoke indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Qu Huadao nodded: "No problem."</p><p></p><p>As the Holy Master's figure disappeared, Qu Huadao's expression turned ferocious again.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Provinces... My son, you can rest assured, your father will definitely not let any of the murderers off, and I will even root out the forces behind them!"</p><p></p><p>Qu Huadao was well aware of Qu Peng going to the Nine Provinces, so to facilitate his actions, he even handed over an ancient weapon he had refined for years.</p><p></p><p>Normally, with Qu Peng's Divine Transformation Realm ninth level cultivation and an ancient weapon to protect him, even Dao Palace Realm experts would be unable to defeat him, at most he could retreat unharmed.</p><p></p><p>But Qu Huadao no longer cared about such details.</p><p></p><p>He then left the Feather Transformation Holy Land and headed towards the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>As Qu Huadao left, the Holy Master of Feather Transformation stood with his hands behind his back, watching the departing figure with an indifferent expression, seemingly without any emotional changes.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, an elder spoke up, "Holy Master, aren't you worried that Sword Peak Master Qu might obtain the great saint's inheritance?"</p><p></p><p>"Sword Peak's ambition is already obvious. If Qu Huadao were to obtain the great saint's inheritance, it would definitely endanger the orthodox status of the Feather Peak."</p><p></p><p>The elder's concerns were not unreasonable. Among the nine peaks of the Feather Transformation Holy Land, the Feather Peak was the leader. But the nine peaks were not entirely harmonious, with hidden struggles. In recent years, Qu Huadao had reached the ninth level of the Dao Palace Realm, greatly enhancing Sword Peak's influence, causing some other thoughts to arise.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Master of Feather Transformation spoke indifferently, "The Nine Provinces are not that simple. The supreme forces of ancient times emerged from the Nine Provinces, and although that force has disappeared, over the ages, many powerful cultivators have entered the Nine Provinces, seeking its traces."</p><p></p><p>"However, among all those who have entered the Nine Provinces, how many have truly walked out of it?"</p><p></p><p>"For in the Nine Provinces, there are great terrors!"</p><p></p><p>"Now that the inheritance of the Heavenly Phoenix Great Saint has appeared, whether Sword Peak can obtain it is also a question. Moreover, according to the news, the Nine Provinces, which has been in decline for many years, also has a top expert emerging now."</p><p></p><p>"So let's just wait and see how it unfolds."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Master of Feather Transformation had his own plans. From his position, he could understand that the Nine Provinces were not as simple as they seemed. In the past, there were no shortage of saints and great saints who entered the Nine Provinces, but even at that level, a moment of carelessness could lead to their demise there.</p><p></p><p>So those who were truly aware of the history of the Nine Provinces were extremely cautious about this opportunity.</p>

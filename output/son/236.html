        <h1>Chapter 236</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the figure in the void, and the majestic holy aura permeated, making his entire body's qi and blood boil.</p><p></p><p>There was no fear in his eyes, only a strong fighting intent.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also wanted to witness the strength of the Saint from the Primal Chaos Realm, to see how powerful such an existence could be.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Hongtiān bowed respectfully to the Empyrean Saint, saying with a reverent expression: "A powerful expert has come to attack us, please, Saint, take action and slay this villain!"</p><p></p><p>"Allowed!"</p><p></p><p>The Empyrean Saint uttered a single word, devoid of any emotion.</p><p></p><p>Immediately.</p><p></p><p>The opponent grabbed the Empyrean Mirror and directly unleashed a world-destroying divine light, which in an instant pierced through the layers of void and pressed down towards Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Today, let this seat witness the true strength of the so-called Saint!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng laughed loudly, the icy brilliance of the Slaying Evil Knife fully displayed, his terrifying qi and blood power surging towards the heavens, like a dazzling great sun, and in the moment the divine light descended, he swung out a fierce slash.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The terrifying blade qi shattered the void, directly cleaving that world-destroying divine light.</p><p></p><p>The remaining momentum of the blade light surged towards the Empyrean Saint, who punched out, the two forces canceling each other out.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>In the moment the blade light dissipated, Gu Qingfeng took a step forward, his overwhelming blade intent bursting through the clouds, colossal power converging on his body, transforming into the Primal Chaos Heaven Sword and once again striking towards the Empyrean Saint.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>A trace of emotion finally appeared on the Empyrean Saint's expressionless face.</p><p></p><p>Immediately.</p><p></p><p>He summoned the Empyrean Mirror, and towering raging flames swept across the heavens and earth, as if the great sun and golden crow had been born, and in the moment they spread their wings and took flight, endless true flames unfurled.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Golden Crow of the Great Sun!"</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the Empyrean Mirror was forged by the Empyrean Saint based on the legendary Golden Crow Divine Mirror, and now it seems the rumors are true!"</p><p></p><p>"Such divine might, it should be able to subdue even ordinary Saints!"</p><p></p><p>"Gu Qingfeng is also no ordinary person, even with the power of the Empyrean Saint manifested, he has not been directly suppressed, truly formidable—"</p><p></p><p>Watching the two figures clashing in the void, all the powerful experts were shocked.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Empyrean Saint was not unexpected to them.</p><p></p><p>After all, although he had already perished, the power he left behind in the Saint Treasure was comparable to a true Saint.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>The power Gu Qingfeng displayed was truly astonishing to the various experts.</p><p></p><p>They had originally thought Gu Qingfeng was only a Half-Saint, but now it seems his strength was far beyond that.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise.</p><p></p><p>How could he contend with a Saint wielding the Empyrean Mirror?</p><p></p><p>One must know that.</p><p></p><p>A Saint possessing a Saint Treasure is the pinnacle of Saints.</p><p></p><p>As long as the power the Empyrean Saint left in the Empyrean Mirror was not exhausted, he would always be equivalent to a true Saint.</p><p></p><p>In this era where Saints do not emerge, such an existence is capable of sweeping away everything.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's ability to fight the Empyrean Saint was truly unbelievable to them.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Boom! Rumble!!</p><p></p><p>In the void, the Empyrean Saint wielded the Empyrean Mirror, unleashing dazzling solar divine lights, seemingly setting the entire space ablaze, the terrifying flames within capable of reducing any cultivator below the Saint Realm to ashes.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Facing such attacks, Gu Qingfeng was not at all at a disadvantage, his towering qi and blood like a vast ocean, his unparalleled blade intent annihilating everything.</p><p></p><p>No matter how terrifying the Empyrean Saint's attacks were, they could not harm him in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression became somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the power of a Saint, it seems I have overestimated the so-called Saints!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Gu Qingfeng's figure suddenly stopped, and at this moment, the Empyrean Saint also raised the Empyrean Mirror, a terrifying Golden Crow of raging flames converging and charging towards him.</p><p></p><p>The scorching waves were already surging towards him before the Golden Crow arrived.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression remained indifferent as he looked at the approaching Golden Crow.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to end this!"</p><p></p><p>Before the words had fully left his mouth, he took a step forward, channeling all his qi and blood into the Slaying Evil Knife, and the boundless Heavenly Sword Dao Phantom coalesced in the sky, finally merging with Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>A single sword strike descended.</p><p></p><p>All was annihilated!</p><p></p><p>The Golden Crow was the first to be struck, its body instantly torn apart by the blade qi and dissipating into the sky as divine flames.</p><p></p><p>But after slaying the Golden Crow, the sword strike did not stop, continuing towards the Empyrean Saint.</p><p></p><p>The latter's expression changed slightly, having no choice but to summon the Empyrean Mirror to block.</p><p></p><p>In the next breath.</p><p></p><p>The long sword had ruthlessly struck the Empyrean Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>A crisp sound rang out.</p><p></p><p>Countless cracks appeared on the Saint Treasure, and in just a few breaths, it shattered completely.</p><p></p><p>The Saint Treasure was destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The Empyrean Saint's phantom dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The unstopped sword strike pierced deep into the void, as if cleaving the entire Ferocious Beast Mountain Range, causing the earth to crumble, the mountains to collapse, and countless fierce beasts to be buried.</p><p></p><p>"No... it's impossible, how could the Empyrean Saint be defeated!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Empyrean Mirror shattered and the Empyrean Saint's phantom vanish, Shangguan Hongtiān's face turned deathly pale, his eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>What had he witnessed? The Empyrean Saint had been defeated!</p><p></p><p>And the Empyrean Mirror had been destroyed as well!</p><p></p><p>One must know that.</p><p></p><p>The reason the Shangguan Clan was able to stand as a Saint Clan and remain unshaken for so long was precisely because they had a Saint Treasure guarding them.</p><p></p><p>If there was no Saint Treasure, the Shangguan Clan might have been destroyed long ago.</p><p></p><p>After all.</p><p></p><p>When the Empyrean Saint was still alive, the Shangguan Clan had offended many forces, and it was only after the Saint's passing, leaving the Saint Treasure to guard the clan, that they were able to intimidate the various powers.</p><p></p><p>If they lost the Saint Treasure, the Shangguan Clan would no longer be worthy of being called a Saint Clan.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>Many of the Shangguan Clan's past enemies, most likely, would seize the opportunity to strike.</p><p></p><p>Such a situation was definitely not what Shangguan Hongtiān wanted to see.</p><p></p><p>If he had foreseen today's events, Shangguan Hongtiān would never have used the Saint Treasure.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Before Shangguan Hongtiān could lament for long, a frigid killing intent descended upon him, making his entire body instinctively tremble, and when he followed the source of that killing intent, he met Gu Qingfeng's cold gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, you can't kill me..."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Hongtiān's heart trembled, the fear of death instantly overwhelming all other thoughts, but before he could finish speaking, Gu Qingfeng had already brought down the sword.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>This Shangguan Clan Elder who had reached the Dao Palace Realm's ninth layer was directly drenched in blood.</p><p></p><p>After slaying the Shangguan Clan, Gu Qingfeng's movements did not stop, a single sword strike transforming into countless blade qi, covering all the Shangguan Clan cultivators.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a divine light suddenly surged from Shangguan Yushen, and a phantom emerged from him.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, this is my Shangguan Clan..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>But before the illusory figure could finish speaking, it was instantly killed by the sword qi.</p><p></p><p>Those who were killed together included:</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Yu and other cultivators from the Shangguan clan.</p><p></p><p>A single sword strike fell.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators from the Shangguan clan were killed on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the broken and battered bodies of the Shangguan clan cultivators, the other cultivators all had the same thought in their minds.</p><p></p><p>The Shangguan clan is finished!</p><p></p><p>In this battle, not only did the Shangguan clan lose a Dao Palace Realm Ninth Layer expert, even their clan's sacred weapon was shattered.</p><p></p><p>The foundation of this so-called saintly clan has now been reduced to almost nothing.</p><p></p><p>The consequences of a saintly clan with so little saintly foundation are self-evident.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Shangguan clan still had powerful experts, they had offended many formidable forces. In the past, their sacred weapon could still deter others, but now that it was destroyed, the situation was uncertain.</p><p></p><p>"A Saint!"</p><p>"This person is not a Demigod, but a true Saint!!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Yu was shocked, but also secretly relieved. Fortunately, he had not acted in time, or else he might have perished as well.</p><p></p><p>Just as Shi Yu was thinking this, a cold voice suddenly reached his ears.</p><p></p><p>"You also want to covet my Gu family's Saint inheritance?"</p><p></p><p>"No... I didn't..." </p><p></p><p>Shi Yu trembled under Gu Qingfeng's icy gaze, hastily trying to explain himself, but Gu Qingfeng did not give him any chance.</p><p></p><p>A punch was unleashed, and the Dao Palace Realm Sixth Layer Shi Yu was instantly pulverized.</p><p></p><p>After slaying Shi Yu, Gu Qingfeng stepped forward, and a terrifying aura of sword intent spread out, slashing countless sword qi towards the other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, dozens of cultivators were drenched in blood on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"We did not attack the Gu family, please spare us, senior!!"</p><p></p><p>A Dao Palace Realm expert cried out in terror, no longer caring about his dignity as he begged for mercy.</p><p></p><p>However, the only response he received was a fist.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>His Dao Palace Realm body exploded, leaving no trace behind.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng slowly retracted his fist and said coldly, "I said that either I would kill you all, or you would kill me!"</p><p></p><p>"But now, it seems that I am the one still alive!"</p><p></p><p>"As for you all..."</p><p></p><p>"You no longer have any need to live!"</p><p></p><p>As Gu Qingfeng's words fell, the terrifying sword qi instantly swept across everything. Whether they were Dao Palace Realm cultivators or Shen Bian Realm cultivators, they had no chance of survival under such an attack.</p><p></p><p>Bodies exploded, the land stained with blood.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the remaining cultivators were horrified, no longer caring about the Saint inheritance, and fled towards the Ancient Beast Mountain Range without looking back.</p><p></p><p>Seeing some cultivators escaping his sword intent domain, Gu Qingfeng flicked his finger, and a gale tore through the void, directly blasting the head of a Dao Palace Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The headless body then fell from the sky.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Slaughter! Indiscriminate slaughter! Gu Qingfeng did not spare any cultivator who had spoken up, wanting to share the Saint inheritance, killing them all on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, he also completely annihilated the other cultivators who came with them, to eliminate any future troubles.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the area in front of Jing'an County had become a true battlefield of carnage.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Fu He looked at the bloody scene before him, his face also revealing a look of terror.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that Gu Qingfeng's strength would be so terrifying, directly shattering the sacred weapon of the Shangguan clan.</p><p></p><p>After all, only a Saint could destroy a sacred weapon.</p><p></p><p>It meant that Gu Qingfeng was undoubtedly a Saint.</p><p></p><p>Even if he had not reached the Saint Realm in terms of cultivation, his strength was at least at the Saint level.</p><p></p><p>In this era, such an existence could be considered invincible.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the slaughter continued.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng slowly approached the camp of the Guiyuan Imperial Dynasty, looking at Ji Meng and the hundred thousand Divine Emperor's Army before him. Without a word, he simply unleashed endless sword qi to attack the Divine Emperor's Army.</p><p></p><p>"Form up the formation!" Ji Meng roared, his aura surging as he connected with the Divine Emperor's Army, instantly reaching a level comparable to the Dao Palace Realm Ninth Layer.</p><p></p><p>Facing the incoming sword qi, Ji Meng wielded his long spear, deflecting all the attacks.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Qingfeng gripped his long sword and struck down, the terrifying power tearing the space apart, forcing Ji Meng to raise his spear to block.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the spear shattered.</p><p></p><p>A bloody line appeared on Ji Meng's brow, quickly spreading across his entire body. In the next breath, his body was split in two, his innards spilling onto the ground.</p><p></p><p>After slaying Ji Meng, Gu Qingfeng's expression remained unchanged as he struck out with his palm, causing numerous Divine Emperor's Army soldiers to explode.</p><p></p><p>A few breaths later, the killing stopped.</p><p></p><p>The ground was completely dyed red with blood, countless broken bodies lying everywhere, with severed limbs and scattered remains visible. In just a short moment, tens of thousands had perished.</p><p></p><p>Amidst this sea of blood and corpses, only a figure in blue robes stood calmly, untainted by the carnage around him.</p><p></p><p>However, not all the cultivators had been slaughtered to the last. There were still a few who had barely survived, their faces filled with terror as they looked at Gu Qingfeng's back, some even trembling so much that their pants were stained with yellow liquid.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng's gaze fell upon them, they immediately turned deathly pale, some even shaking uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"Saint... please spare us!!"</p><p></p><p>A Dao Palace Realm cultivator immediately knelt down, and the others quickly followed suit, their pride and dignity now meaningless in the face of life and death.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng spoke indifferently, "You all need not worry. I am not a bloodthirsty person. As long as you are not my enemy, I will not strike you down.</p><p></p><p>Although you have come from the Five Domains, the Nine Provinces are also a part of the Primordial Realm. Since you have come here, I welcome you.</p><p></p><p>However, I do not wish to see any chaos being stirred up in the Nine Provinces. If that happens, this will be the fate that awaits you."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, the Saint's words are absolutely right!"</p><p>"We have no ill intentions towards the Nine Provinces!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing that Gu Qingfeng was willing to spare them, the cultivators immediately felt a great sense of relief, as if they had narrowly escaped death.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, some cultivators stood up and cupped their hands towards Gu Qingfeng, saying, "I shall take my leave now."</p><p></p><p>With that, they turned and fled towards the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, their haste almost resembling a rout.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Gu Qingfeng truly did not attack them, the other cultivators also hastily imitated the previous ones, fleeing in panic, as if there was a ferocious beast in the Nine Provinces chasing after them. Not a single one dared to linger.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

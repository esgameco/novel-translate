        <h1>Chapter 57</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"By refining evil into my body, I have become a powerful sorcerer. There is a powerful evil entity sealed within me, and if I were to die, that evil entity would surely revive."</p><p></p><p>"This evil entity is indestructible. If it were to revive, not only would the people of the Qingyang Sect perish, but you too would be unable to escape its wrath."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, if this evil entity were to wreak havoc, and the imperial court were to investigate, your family would also be unable to avoid punishment."</p><p></p><p>"Release me, and I can guarantee that I will no longer be an enemy to your family in the future."</p><p></p><p>The Elder of the Qingyang Sect hurriedly spoke, his words containing a veiled threat, but also a tone of submission.</p><p></p><p>The situation was stronger than the person.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's strength had caught the Qingyang Elder off guard.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, submission was the only path he could take.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, the Qingyang Elder was not afraid that Gu Qingfeng would refuse.</p><p></p><p>After all, allowing the evil entity to wreak havoc was no small matter. If the imperial court were to investigate, the small Gu family would be instantly reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, once you're dead, the evil entity within you will no longer be able to run amok!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Peng!"</p><p></p><p>"At your service!"</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, bring out the item I had you prepare!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, due to the Qingyang Elder's defeat, the fighting in the area had abruptly ceased. Hearing the order, Meng Peng immediately rushed towards the carriage.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a golden coffin burst out from the carriage curtain. Gu Qingfeng raised his hand and caught the golden coffin, then slammed it heavily onto the ground.</p><p></p><p>"A golden coffin!!"</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing the golden coffin before him, the Qingyang Elder's face suddenly changed drastically. In this moment, the Elder was truly afraid.</p><p></p><p>He had never imagined that Gu Qingfeng would have gold, and that he had even used it to forge a coffin.</p><p></p><p>"The evil entity is indestructible, but that doesn't mean it cannot be suppressed."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was cold. As the golden coffin was opened, the Qingyang Elder's terror became increasingly evident.</p><p></p><p>"Noâ€”"</p><p></p><p>"Spare my life, and I will give you the method for refining evil into the body to become a sorcerer!"</p><p></p><p>"A martial artist's lifespan is limited. Even upon reaching the Patriarch realm, it is merely a few hundred years. Only by refining evil into the body to become a sorcerer can one step into the rumored realm of eternal life."</p><p></p><p>"But the method for refining evil into the body is highly guarded by the major sects and families. Ordinary members have no chance of obtaining it."</p><p></p><p>"Release me, and I will tell you my method for refining evil into the body. Once you have become a sorcerer by refining the evil, you too can one day reach the pinnacle of longevity!"</p><p></p><p>If earlier the Qingyang Elder had relied on the evil entity sealed within him, not fearing that Gu Qingfeng would kill him, as the matter would become complicated if the evil entity were to wreak havoc.</p><p></p><p>However, the appearance of the golden coffin had made the Qingyang Elder realize that he had miscalculated.</p><p></p><p>Reaching this point, he could only plead for mercy.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was better to live than to die.</p><p></p><p>The Qingyang Elder had worked hard to reach this step, and he was unwilling to perish here.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, no matter how the Qingyang Elder pleaded, Gu Qingfeng had no intention of sparing him. Gu Qingfeng unleashed a series of powerful punches, all landing on the Qingyang Elder's head.</p><p></p><p>The Qingyang Elder had once been a martial artist with perfected bone refinement, his bones transformed into golden bones. But in the face of Gu Qingfeng's mountain-shattering strength, they were as fragile as paper.</p><p></p><p>A few punches landed, and the Elder's head burst open like a watermelon.</p><p></p><p>The Qingyang Sect's Elder had perished on the spot.</p><p></p><p>With the Qingyang Elder's death, the ominous and eerie aura from his body grew increasingly severe, and the shadow beneath him began to twist and turn frantically, as if it was about to revive at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Qingfeng did not hesitate.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The body of the Elder Qingyang was directly thrown into the golden coffin, and then the coffin lid was closed.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>The golden coffin violently shook, as if something was being born and forcefully breaking out.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the coffin lid was about to be flung open, Gu Qingfeng's body leaped up and heavily stepped on the coffin lid, causing the previously violently shaking coffin lid to become completely calm. Although the interior of the golden coffin was still violently shaking, the problem was no longer serious.</p><p></p><p>"Give me the other things!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pressed down on the coffin lid and then looked at Meng Peng and said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Meng Peng immediately took out the iron chains that had been prepared earlier and handed them to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>After receiving the iron chains, Gu Qingfeng bound the entire golden coffin, the thick iron chains being specially forged by him for this moment.</p><p></p><p>After the golden coffin was completely bound, Gu Qingfeng finally left the coffin lid.</p><p></p><p>As expected.</p><p></p><p>This time, although the golden coffin was still violently shaking, it temporarily could not break through the iron chains and lift the coffin lid.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Qingfeng found that the information panel had refreshed with new text again.</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' witnessed you subdue the Elder Qingyang with his own eyes, and his admiration for you has reached its peak, achieving the 'Admiring You More and More' (can only be triggered once) achievement!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +100 Upgrade Points!"</p><p>"Reward: +100 Blood Qi Elixirs!"</p><p>"Reward: +100 Blood Refining Elixirs!"</p><p>"Reward: +100 Bone Refining Elixirs!"</p><p>"Reward: +10 Breakthrough Elixirs (Blood Refining)!"</p><p>"Reward: Perfected-Grade Excellent Martial Art 'Divine Celestial Body'!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Exploded! A huge explosion!</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng never expected that subduing the Elder Qingyang could bring such benefits.</p><p></p><p>Such a generous reward made even Gu Qingfeng involuntarily take a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>One hundred upgrade points! And the other various elixirs are also one hundred each.</p><p>And the first appearance of the Breakthrough Elixir.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, these things are extremely precious.</p><p></p><p>However, what really caught Gu Qingfeng's attention was the final reward of the perfected-grade excellent martial art.</p><p></p><p>The Perfected-Grade 'Divine Celestial Body'!</p><p></p><p>After previously obtaining the perfected-grade 'Divine Overlord Body', Gu Qingfeng understood how powerful a perfected-grade martial art could be.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Gu Qingfeng did not immediately extract these rewards, but instead had Meng Peng carry the golden coffin back onto the carriage, and then turned to look at the group of Qingyang Sect disciples before him.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Gu Qingfeng spoke a few words.</p><p></p><p>"Kill, not leaving a single one!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The massacre erupted in the Qingyang Sect.</p><p></p><p>Without the Elder Qingyang to lead them, the remaining Qingyang Sect disciples were no match for the Gu Family. Gu Qingfeng took the initiative to deal with some of the stronger Blood Refining realm cultivators, and then left the rest of the Qingyang Sect disciples to be handled by Gu Yang and the others.</p><p></p><p>In less than half a day, the vast Qingyang Sect had been completely wiped out.</p><p></p><p>As for the annihilation of the Qingyang Sect, Gu Qingfeng had no emotional fluctuations in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Elder Qingyang had cultivated evil techniques and consumed ordinary human flesh and blood, and these Qingyang Sect disciples were his accomplices, their hands stained with the blood of countless innocent lives. Killing them was just killing them.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were innocent people in the Qingyang Sect, it didn't matter.</p><p>The Gu Family had already torn off their facade with the Qingyang Sect, naturally there was no possibility of holding back.</p><p></p><p>As for whether they killed the wrong people or not, Gu Qingfeng didn't care at all.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was not a good person.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

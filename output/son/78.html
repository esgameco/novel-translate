        <h1>Chapter 78</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In the main hall, Gu Yang knelt down on one knee and bowed with his head lowered.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression remained unchanged: "Why would I blame you, my son?"</p><p></p><p>"I have slain the true inheritor of the Crimson Sun Sect, which may bring trouble to the Gu Family Manor, so I have specially requested for you to punish me!"</p><p></p><p>"As far as I know, the destruction of the True Sun Sect was actually done by that Crimson Flame Sect's true inheritor. By killing him, you were defending the prestige of our Gu Family Manor, so this act has merit rather than fault!"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the kneeling Gu Yang, Gu Qingfeng smiled calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you may rise now."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang then stood up.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "I've told you before, you can go ahead and take action against any force that dares to interfere with the White Stone Dao."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Crimson Flame Sect is quite powerful, they may not necessarily be able to run amok in the White Stone Dao."</p><p></p><p>"As for just a true inheritor, killing him is no big deal. However, your strength still needs to be further improved. While the Tyrannical Saber Slash has assisted you in the Blood Refining realm, if you were to encounter a true powerful expert, you might still have difficulty being their true match!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng gave a few more reminders.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang could only lower his head and obey.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng waved his hand, dismissing the other person, and then summoned Gu Peng, instructing him to lead the outer court disciples to pay close attention to the movements of the Crimson Flame Sect.</p><p></p><p>Although in front of Gu Yang, Gu Qingfeng expressed that he was not at all concerned about the Crimson Flame Sect, the Crimson Flame Sect was still a sect force stronger than the Azure Yang Sect.</p><p></p><p>Even if they were on par with the Zhuo Family, a thousand-year-old ancient clan, the Crimson Flame Sect might not necessarily be much inferior.</p><p></p><p>For such a sect,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng naturally could not truly ignore them.</p><p></p><p>Given the Crimson Flame Sect's foundation, there must be Spirit Realm cultivators within the sect, and at least some Blood Refining realm martial artists, though it remains unknown for now.</p><p></p><p>"The top-tier Spirit Realm cultivators can contend with true sect masters, but the Crimson Flame Sect may not necessarily have such high-level Spirit Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the entire Taishan Prefecture, the truly powerful experts who have reached the sect master realm are probably only a handful.</p><p></p><p>And with my current strength, as long as no sect masters emerge, I will have the ability to fight them!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes grew slightly cold, and an aura of overwhelming sword intent seemed to emanate from him, a tyrannical and boundless killing intent.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>He had initially grasped the existence of the True Meaning.</p><p></p><p>Later,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng continued to ponder the True Meaning of the sect masters and cultivate his own martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Now, </p><p></p><p>He only wanted to enhance his own power as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>And during Gu Qingfeng's seclusion, he would also frequently check the changes in the information panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain a Blood Refining mid-realm martial artist!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain a Blood Refining late-realm martial artist!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain 10 Skin Refining mid-realm martial artists!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain 30 Skin Refining late-realm martial artists!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has deepened his understanding of the Tyrannical Saber Slash, and his strength has steadily improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain 2 Blood Refining Perfected realm martial artists!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain a Bone Refining initial-realm martial artist!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang'..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The densely packed information panel data continuously refreshed, showing that Gu Yang had completely gone on a killing spree in the White Stone Dao.</p><p></p><p>The foundation built by the Blood Refining Elixir, along with the cultivation of the top-tier martial arts of the Blood Refining realm and the mastery of the sect master's supreme techniques, were sufficient to allow Gu Yang to leap across a major realm and slay his enemies.</p><p></p><p>From the Blood Refining initial realm,</p><p></p><p>He could directly slay those in the Bone Refining initial realm!</p><p></p><p>This also showed that the chaos in the Taishan Dao had already had a significant impact.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang would not have been able to go on such a rampage.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>With Gu Yang's current strength,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The resolution of these problems was not particularly troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng opened his mouth and swallowed a wisp of the great sun's yang energy, causing his entire body's qi and blood to surge, with the pure yang energy within the qi and blood increasing by a few more parts. The Qingyang Technique silently broke through from the second layer of entry to the second layer of minor accomplishment.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately.</p><p></p><p>The Qingyang Technique was ultimately only a top-grade martial art.</p><p></p><p>The improvement in his strength brought about by such a level of breakthrough was extremely limited.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng continued to ponder the true intent of the sect master.</p><p></p><p>Each time he used the killing true intent to stimulate the sect master's true intent, Gu Qingfeng's understanding of the sect master's true intent deepened further.</p><p></p><p>In this way.</p><p></p><p>The distance to his true comprehension of the Overlord Saber Slash was getting closer and closer.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Crimson Flame Sect.</p><p></p><p>There was a red-haired old man with a furious expression, emanating a scorching and icy aura from his body, terrifying like the coexistence of fire and ice.</p><p></p><p>"The Gu Family Village actually dared to kill my Crimson Flame Peak's true disciple, which is truly despicable. I, the old man, have not taken action for these years, but have allowed the scoundrel to run rampant!"</p><p></p><p>His gaze was filled with icy killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Ning Fu was the one he had greatly favored, with a high chance of breaking through the Refining Impurity realm to become a minor sect master in the future.</p><p></p><p>Refining Impurity cultivators.</p><p></p><p>No matter where they were, they were extremely precious.</p><p></p><p>If one were to refine evil into their body,</p><p></p><p>They would surely become a powerful sorcerer.</p><p></p><p>However——</p><p></p><p>What truly angered Weng Jiao was not the demise of Ning Fu, which would leave the Crimson Flame Peak with one less top expert in the future.</p><p></p><p>It was that Ning Fu's death had wasted the efforts he had cultivated for many years, and even affected his subsequent cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Weng Jiao could no longer sit still.</p><p></p><p>He had to take action.</p><p></p><p>To bloodily purge the Gu Family Master.</p><p></p><p>Since Ning Fu was gone, Weng Jiao would make the people of the Gu Family Village pay with their lives.</p><p></p><p>Immediately.</p><p></p><p>Weng Jiao left the Crimson Flame Peak and headed towards the direction of the White Stone Path.</p><p></p><p>The moment he left the sect, the news was also transmitted to the other powerful figures of the Crimson Flame Sect.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p></p><p>These people all shook their heads slightly, with a hint of pity on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"This time, the Gu Family Village is likely to be doomed!"</p><p></p><p>"Given Weng Peak Master's temperament, this time not only the Gu Family Village will suffer, but the other forces of the White Stone Path are likely to be in trouble as well."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, mere insects, they can just die."</p><p></p><p>"Although that's the case, there might be some trouble from the imperial court——"</p><p></p><p>"The imperial court is now preoccupied with its own affairs, and as long as we, the sects, do not collude with the rebels, we have already shown favor to the Great Xuan Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Now, with just the death of some insects, I reckon the imperial court would not dare to say a word.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if we sects ally with the rebels, the fall of Guangyang Prefecture would be a matter of moments."</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the other powerful figures of the Crimson Flame Sect, with Weng Jiao personally taking action, the White Stone Path was destined to be drenched in blood.</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family Village would be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Other forces would also be implicated.</p><p></p><p>But the life and death of mere insects, they would not care about.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Crimson Flame Sect's gaze was more focused on the Taishan Path.</p><p></p><p>In the face of the Taishan Path, the insignificant White Stone Path was not worth mentioning at all. If they could subdue the Taishan Path, that would be the true great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Now, the major forces of the Taishan Path were gathered, and it was not an easy task for the Crimson Flame Sect to suppress the other forces and seize the dominance of the Taishan Path.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Crimson Flame Sect did not pay much attention to Weng Jiao's actions.</p>

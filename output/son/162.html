        <h1>Chapter 162</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Tian Yang Sect!</p><p></p><p>Gu Yu Tian! The top expert of the Nine Realms.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "a person's name is like the shadow of a tree," the appearance of Gu Yu Tian immediately instilled a tremendous sense of pressure in everyone.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang also led a group of powerful bodyguards to arrive.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Patriarch of the Tian Yang Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the figure on the carriage, Gu Yang felt a deep sense of dread within.</p><p></p><p>Especially when he met Gu Yu Tian's gaze, the terrifying oppressive aura washed over him, making his breathing somewhat labored.</p><p></p><p>A powerful expert! An incredibly terrifying expert! If this person wanted to kill him, Gu Yang suspected that a single finger would be enough.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Gu Yang had absolute confidence in Gu Qing Feng's ability to defeat Gu Yu Tian.</p><p></p><p>But now,</p><p></p><p>after witnessing Gu Yu Tian's formidable presence, that confidence began to waver.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>Could his father really handle him? Thinking about this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang asked the nearby Gu Yi, "If this person attacks, what are the chances of you surviving?"</p><p></p><p>He did not ask about the chances of resisting, but the probability of surviving.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p></p><p>no matter how strong Gu Yi was as a Xian Tong Master, he would not have the qualifications to withstand a peak Hua Sheng Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi was silent for a moment, then slowly said, "If this person attacks, I have no chance of surviving at all!"</p><p></p><p>This statement was cruel, but it was the truth.</p><p></p><p>Faced with Gu Yu Tian's terrifying aura, Gu Yi felt that he not only lacked the ability to survive, but even the ability to fight back.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang also fell silent.</p><p></p><p>In this moment,</p><p></p><p>he understood the terrifying power of a top-tier expert.</p><p></p><p>Even though he commanded a vast army of hundreds of thousands under Guang Yang Prefecture, experts like Gu Yu Tian could easily overwhelm them.</p><p></p><p>If given enough time, this person could even wipe out the entire Guang Yang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yu Tian's calm voice echoed across the area.</p><p></p><p>"I have arrived. Why hasn't Gu Qing Feng come out to meet his death?"</p><p></p><p>These simple and calm words contained absolute domination.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>as soon as the words left his mouth, a figure slowly emerged from the city.</p><p></p><p>"Since you're so eager to die, Gu will oblige you!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qing Feng stopped about ten zhang (approximately 33 meters) in front of the carriage, his gaze fixed on the figure inside. As for the other members of the Tian Yang Sword Sect, he had completely ignored them.</p><p></p><p>"So you are Gu Qing Feng!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yu Tian's blood-red eyes fell upon Gu Qing Feng, and the surging spiritual power within Gu Qing Feng's body ignited a desire within him to devour it.</p><p></p><p>Intuitively,</p><p></p><p>a voice told him that if he could consume Gu Qing Feng, he would be able to break through the limits of the Hua Sheng Realm and ascend to an even higher level.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect you to have the courage to appear before me!"</p><p></p><p>"I originally wanted to kill you first, and then wipe out the entire Gu Family Manor, but now I've changed my mind. If you commit suicide here, I can promise to spare the Gu Family Manor!"</p><p></p><p>As Gu Yu Tian spoke, he couldn't help but lick his lips, and his eerie expression became even more sinister.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qing Feng smiled faintly, "Actually, Gu has a third choice."</p><p></p><p>"What choice?"</p><p></p><p>"Kill you, destroy your Tian Yang Sword Sect, and all problems will be solved!"</p><p></p><p>As Gu Qing Feng said this, a sharp light flashed in his eyes, and a powerful sword intent erupted from his body, as if an invisible sword was about to strike the carriage.</p><p></p><p>Boom—</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The shattered carriage was swept away.</p><p></p><p>No one knew how many people from the Yanjian Sect had been affected, directly slain on the spot by this overwhelming force.</p><p></p><p>A sudden, unexpected turn of events.</p><p></p><p>It shocked all the onlookers around.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the broken carriage, the figure of Gu Yuetian rose into the air, emanating an extremely chilling aura that radiated outwards in all directions from him.</p><p></p><p>The aura was like an abyss!</p><p>Freezing the heavens and the earth!</p><p></p><p>A towering blood mist emanated from Gu Yuetian's body, as if a terrifying, ominous phantom was gestating within it. This shadowy figure seemed to rival the mountains and stars, exuding a dreadful, abysmal pressure that caused many of the observing experts to change expression after expression.</p><p></p><p>Many could not even withstand this oppressive aura, their whole bodies shaking as if struck, and they ended up vomiting blood uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"Pu chi!"</p><p></p><p>A mouthful of fresh blood was spat out.</p><p></p><p>All eyes were filled with terror as they looked at Gu Yuetian.</p><p></p><p>"This is the power of a top expert in the Nine Provinces!"</p><p></p><p>"Terrifying beyond measure—"</p><p></p><p>Not just the others, even the powerful cultivators from the Shenjian Sect and the Ji Clan, ancient and venerable sects, had expressions of sheer dread when they gazed upon Gu Yuetian.</p><p></p><p>Experts of such a high level would rarely go all-out, and even if they did, they seldom used their full strength.</p><p></p><p>But now, the overwhelming aura Gu Yuetian was unleashing made these onlookers deeply feel the terrifying might of a supreme existence.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, </p><p>their gazes towards Gu Qingfeng were like looking at a dead man.</p><p></p><p>Undeniably, Gu Qingfeng's feat of slaying Jiang Shidao from afar with a single sword strike was astonishingly powerful, even reaching the level of a True Meaning Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>However, </p><p>it all depended on who the opponent was.</p><p></p><p>Against someone like Gu Yuetian, in the eyes of the onlookers, Gu Qingfeng would undoubtedly be no match.</p><p></p><p>After all, a Transformation Realm expert could already rival a Grand Master. </p><p>The top Transformation Realm experts had already broken through the shackles of the Grand Master realm, stepping into an even higher plane.</p><p></p><p>"I originally wanted to give you a chance, but it's a pity you didn't cherish it. Today, not only will I make you die, but I will also make the entire Guangyang Prefecture perish!"</p><p></p><p>"But to become the nourishment for my breakthrough to the Divine Realm, that shall be your honor!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yuetian had now fallen into the abyss of demonic evil. His long black hair had transformed into a blood-red color, his eyes glowing scarlet, his entire being exuding an aura of utmost wickedness.</p><p></p><p>This overwhelming pressure sweeping towards him caused Gu Qingfeng's Zhu Xie Dao to tremble slightly, as if sensing a threat.</p><p></p><p>However—</p><p>Gu Qingfeng's heart was not filled with any fear, but only excitement.</p><p></p><p>Yes, excitement.</p><p>The excitement of facing a supreme expert.</p><p></p><p>Since his breakthrough to the Extreme Dao Master realm, many experts had failed to pique his interest, even elders from immortal sects or Half-step Transformation Realm cultivators, who were mere cannon fodder that he could slay with a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>But the current Gu Yuetian was different. The terrifying aura he was unleashing made Gu Qingfeng feel a threat he had never experienced before, and his dormant vital energy was suddenly roused.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yuetian had now taken action directly. </p><p>As his figure soared through the air, his palm descended towards Gu Qingfeng, a force capable of destroying the heavens and the earth. The space around them became distorted and chaotic, as if it would shatter in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

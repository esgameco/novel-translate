        <h1>Chapter 69</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>But it is not absolute.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng couldn't help but suspect that the reason why the evil spirit could not be killed was because the power of the martial artists and sorcerers was still not strong enough, so they could not truly kill the evil spirit.</p><p></p><p>If the strength was strong enough, the so-called legend of immortality would be completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Then—"</p><p></p><p>"What level of power is needed to truly kill the evil spirit!?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but unlock the iron chains in the golden coffin.</p><p></p><p>Without the restraint of the iron chains, the vibration of the golden coffin became more and more violent, the coffin lid hummed, and the originally tightly sealed coffin suddenly appeared with some cracks, and a strange and cold aura began to spread.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Qingfeng's vision, there were dim shadows that flowed out of the golden coffin like a tide.</p><p></p><p>"Hum—"</p><p></p><p>The Demon-Slaying Sword behind him trembled.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes were cold, and the long sword behind him suddenly drew out, with a stroke of blood energy power cutting the shadow, and the shadow was immediately severed. The remaining shadow retreated back into the golden coffin as if in pain.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng leaped onto the coffin lid and forcefully suppressed the coffin, so that the shadow could no longer break through the restraint of the coffin.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the shadow remnant on the ground, about the size of a thumb, which was emitting a strange and cold aura, and the shadow remnant seemed to be gradually growing stronger, without any sign of disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Qingfeng used the tip of the sword to pick up the shadow remnant and put it in his palm. In an instant, a terrifying icy cold power swept over him, as if it wanted to completely freeze his blood.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression did not change, and the surging blood energy power in his body was fully mobilized, gathering like the proud sun in his palm.</p><p></p><p>"Sizzle—"</p><p></p><p>The two forces collided, making a harsh sound like water falling into hot oil.</p><p></p><p>The icy cold power was terrifying, and no matter how strong Gu Qingfeng's blood energy was, it was difficult to completely consume it.</p><p></p><p>As time passed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's blood energy power was almost exhausted, his face became somewhat pale, and when he observed the shadow remnant in his palm, it seemed that there was no change.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Qingfeng had been carefully observing the changes in the shadow remnant from the beginning to the end.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, the shadow remnant seemed unchanged, but if observed carefully, the aura of the shadow remnant was about 1% weaker than before.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng came down from the coffin lid, opened a small gap, and directly threw the shadow remnant into it, then quickly covered the coffin lid again and re-sealed it with the iron chains.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Gu Qingfeng finally let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>At this time, his face was slightly pale, which was caused by the excessive consumption of blood energy.</p><p></p><p>After recovering a little, his face regained a reddish glow.</p><p></p><p>Then.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's face broke into a smile.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out... the immortality of the evil spirit is false. The reason why the evil spirit cannot be killed is that the power of the martial artists is not enough, so they cannot truly destroy the evil spirit!"</p><p></p><p>The so-called level.</p><p></p><p>It does not refer to the strength or weakness of each other, but the difference in the level of life.</p><p></p><p>Clearly.</p><p></p><p>The life level of the evil spirit is higher.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had almost consumed half of his blood energy just to wear down the shadow remnant by about 1%. To truly consume the remnant to the end, even if his own strength increased tenfold, he still wouldn't be able to do it.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>This is only the remnant of the shadow, the size of a thumb.</p><p></p><p>If he wants to refine the true shadow, not</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Even if the power is ten times, or even a hundred or a thousand times stronger, it would still be impossible to achieve.</p><p></p><p>"Even if the martial arts masters have powerful strength, they cannot be much stronger than the practitioners who cultivate evil arts. So the evil spirits will not die, but this is not just an empty talk!"</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts in this world seem to be flourishing, but it appears that they are likely to be limited to the realm of martial arts masters. As for whether there are higher realms beyond the martial arts masters, it is still debatable."</p><p></p><p>"The powerful ones who initially cultivated evil arts might have wanted to find a way to resolve the evil spirits, but unfortunately, as history has evolved, the meaning of the existence of the sorcerers has changed."</p><p></p><p>"The power of the evil spirits causes people to fall, and the so-called sorcerers are now no different from the evil spirits in their actions. 'At most, the sorcerers just kill more people than the evil spirits, but they kill fewer people than the evil spirits.'"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head slightly. </p><p></p><p>It's still the same story.</p><p></p><p>This world is already hopelessly corrupted.</p><p></p><p>The havoc caused by the evil spirits and the emergence of the sorcerers are all making the order decay and morality decline.</p><p></p><p>After all, the evil spirits will not die.</p><p></p><p>To suppress the evil spirits, one must either seal them or cultivate the evil arts within oneself. </p><p></p><p>This seems to be a vicious cycle.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng does not have the ability to change this world, but if he has the opportunity to eliminate the evil spirits, it would be his heart's desire.</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts in this world seem to revere the martial arts masters as the highest."</p><p></p><p>"But I have an attribute panel, so the martial arts masters may not be the ultimate limit."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I have enough points for advancement, my strength can continue to rise until I break through the gap in the realm of life."</p><p></p><p>"When that time comes, perhaps I will be able to truly eliminate the evil spirits—"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng already had an idea in his mind.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, he does not have the possibility of eliminating the evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>Since he cannot eliminate them,</p><p></p><p>Then he will continue to improve his strength.</p><p></p><p>If he cannot eliminate the evil arts practitioners, then he will become a martial arts master. If the martial arts masters are not enough, then he will break through beyond the martial arts masters.</p><p></p><p>One day,</p><p></p><p>He will be able to grow to the point where he can eliminate the evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>—</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Demon-Subduing Prison,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's life seemed to have returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>It took him several days to consume various tonics to completely restore the depleted qi and blood power consumed by the Yin Spectre's residual damage.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing this incident, Gu Qingfeng temporarily had no intention to continue consuming the Yin Spectre.</p><p></p><p>Given the strength of the evil spirits, his martial arts cultivation at the first realm, even if he spent a thousand years, it would be difficult to completely exhaust a single evil spirit.</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p></p><p>The Yin Spectre's strength is not the strongest among the evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>Even if he really used up all his time to eliminate a Yin Spectre, it would be meaningless.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>In Gu Qingfeng's view, nothing is more useful than breaking through his own strength.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>The great sun's yang energy entered his body.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng only felt his blood and qi boiling, and the pure yang energy in his physical body suddenly increased significantly. The Azure Yang Technique also unknowingly broke through to the second level of the Initiation Realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Azure Yang Technique (Second Level of the Initiation Realm, Pure Yang Blood and Qi at the First Level)...</p><p></p><p>"Pure Yang Blood and Qi!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at his attribute panel, and when the Azure Yang Technique broke through to the second level, his blood and qi underwent subtle changes.</p><p></p><p>This change made his blood and qi become even more unyielding and yang.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng understood.</p><p></p><p>This must be the so-called Pure Yang Blood and Qi.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng felt a sense of awareness, looking outside the Gu family manor, his eyes narrowing slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Someone is coming!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

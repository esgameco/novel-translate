        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Martial Arts: Collapse Mountain Fist (Perfected), Iron Body Technique (Not Yet Learned)</p><p></p><p>Improvement Point: 1--</p><p></p><p>In the bedroom, Gu Qingfeng glanced at his attribute panel and saw that the Martial Arts section now included the Iron Body Technique.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, </p><p>the item inventory had a thin secret manual, which was the Iron Body Technique.</p><p></p><p>This is another function of the item inventory.</p><p></p><p>As long as it is a reward item, it can be extracted from the item inventory and also put back into it, but non-reward items cannot be placed in the item inventory.</p><p></p><p>But even so,</p><p>it still saves a lot of convenience.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the additional improvement point and had an idea.</p><p></p><p>"I don't need to worry about the Iron Body Technique for now, let me first perfect the Collapse Mountain Fist!"</p><p></p><p>The Collapse Mountain Fist is perfected! His own cultivation can now break through to the Refined Skin Perfection.</p><p></p><p>In the current one-mu-three-fen land of Linxian, Refined Skin Perfection is already quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>It can be said to be top-tier,</p><p>and not much different.</p><p></p><p>Immediately,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng used the additional improvement point directly on the Collapse Mountain Fist.</p><p></p><p>In an instant,</p><p>a large amount of memories about the Collapse Mountain Fist surged into Gu Qingfeng's mind, as if he had painstakingly practiced it for decades, and his hands became much rougher and thicker.</p><p></p><p>The skin is tough,</p><p>ordinary knives and swords are hard to injure.</p><p></p><p>"Refined Skin Perfection, achieved!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng let out a long breath, his eyes shining with brilliance.</p><p></p><p>With his talent, to normally cultivate and reach Refined Skin Perfection would have taken at least decades.</p><p></p><p>But now,</p><p>he has broken through to Refined Skin Perfection in just over ten years.</p><p></p><p>Now,</p><p>after reaching Refined Skin Perfection, Gu Qingfeng feels his current strength is completely different from before.</p><p></p><p>Refined Skin martial artists mainly temper their physique to the point where ordinary knives and swords are hard to injure them.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p>ordinary Refined Skin martial artists, although their skin is much tougher than ordinary people, are not to the point where knives and swords are hard to injure them. Only those who have reached Refined Skin Perfection can enter this level.</p><p></p><p>"Refined Skin Perfection, next is to break through to the Refined Blood realm!"</p><p></p><p>"But to break through this realm, if there is no corresponding martial art, the improvement may not be so simple. Whether the Jinniu Martial Hall has an intermediate martial art for breaking through Refined Blood, is currently unknown.</p><p></p><p>However, even if the Jinniu Martial Hall has such a martial art, it is unlikely they would let outsiders cultivate it!"</p><p></p><p>Martial arts are the foundation of a force, don't think that just by paying some silver you can learn martial arts. In fact, any martial hall has its own hidden supreme techniques.</p><p></p><p>Such supreme techniques cannot be easily obtained just by paying some silver.</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p>whether the Jinniu Martial Hall has an intermediate martial art that can break through the Refined Blood realm is an unknown.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p>the Jinniu Martial Hall has not seen the appearance of any Refined Blood martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Jinniu Martial Hall,</p><p>even in the entire Linxian, Gu Qingfeng has not heard of the existence of Refined Blood martial artists.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng left home and headed towards the Jinniu Martial Hall, but on the way he found many civilians gathered in a certain place, whispering to each other with fear on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, this family died so miserably!"</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if they offended some enemy?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't be ridiculous, what kind of enemy can do this? I think they must have been involved in something dirty."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Listening to the discussions of the other commoners, Gu Qingfeng saw several constables come out with their batons, driving away the crowd of onlookers.</p><p></p><p>"Go, go, go, all of you leave, don't stand around here!" </p><p></p><p>Seeing the constables driving them away, the other commoners dared not defy the officials, and hastily dispersed.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>Several more constables were seen carrying a stretcher, covered with a white cloth. Suddenly, a cold breeze blew by, and the white cloth on one of the stretchers was blown open, revealing the face of a middle-aged man's corpse, his complexion ashen, his pupils dilated, his expression rigid.</p><p></p><p>His chest had been ripped open, his internal organs completely scooped out, the corpse emanating a foul, rotting stench that made one want to retch instinctively.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing this corpse, Gu Qingfeng's pupils also shrank abruptly. </p><p></p><p>Especially when his eyes met the dead man's unseeing gaze, a strange, ominous chill rose from the depths of his heart, causing Gu Qingfeng to quicken his pace and leave.</p><p></p><p>Yet even so, the dead man's countenance and the murmurs of the surrounding commoners continued to echo in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Unclean thing..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head, took a deep breath, and banished all the stray thoughts from his mind.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the Jinniu Martial Arts Hall.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng began his daily instruction of the disciples. In his leisure time, he also listened to some of the disciples' conversations during their breaks.</p><p></p><p>Most of these conversations were just casual chatter, but among them were a few special keywords that involuntarily caught Gu Qingfeng's attention.</p><p></p><p>"Unclean!"</p><p>"Eerie!"</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the speaker, a youth around sixteen or seventeen years old, whose name he remembered was Li Niu - a rather ordinary name for an ordinary disciple who, after over a year in the martial arts hall, had still not been able to enter the ranks of the Refined Skin Warriors.</p><p></p><p>"Li Niu, come here for a moment."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's voice rang out, causing the few people in conversation to pause, and the one named Li Niu to walk up to him, bowing respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Master Gu, did you have something you needed me for?"</p><p></p><p>Li Niu asked cautiously, his heart secretly excited, wondering if the master had taken a liking to him. After all, in novels and stories, it was common for a poor youth to be noticed by a hidden master and then be taught martial arts, rising to greatness.</p><p></p><p>In Li Niu's eyes, Gu Qingfeng, as a senior instructor at the Jinniu Martial Arts Hall, was no different from such a hidden master.</p><p></p><p>"I just heard you talking about things being 'unclean' and 'eerie', so I wanted to ask if you knew something about that?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Gu Qingfeng's question, a look of disappointment flashed across Li Niu's face, but he quickly regained his composure and enthusiastically said, "Master Gu, you don't know, but these past few days, there have been several households in the county that have died in strange ways, all of them having been disemboweled and had their internal organs removed. We all suspect that this was not done by human hands, but by some unclean thing."</p><p></p><p>"So many people have died, and the officials haven't found the culprit?"</p><p></p><p>"Heh, how could they find anything? My father says that this is not something humans can do, so no matter how much the officials investigate, it will be in vain!"</p><p></p><p>Listening to Li Niu's words, Gu Qingfeng's expression changed slightly. </p><p></p><p>As a martial artist, his keen senses made him instinctively feel that there was something not quite right about this.</p><p></p><p>After all, although Linxian was not a large county, it still had officials stationed here. If there was a madman ruthlessly taking lives, the officials should not be unable to find any clues at all.</p><p></p><p>In that case, </p><p></p><p>the situation seemed to have become more serious.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

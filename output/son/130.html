        <h1>Chapter 130</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Master has lived for 800 years!"</p><p></p><p>"But the Fusion Spiritual Realm cultivators only have 1,500 years of lifespan."</p><p></p><p>"I have not yet perfected the refinement of my five viscera, but my lifespan has already reached 1,400 years, which is not much different from the Fusion Spiritual Realm cultivators. Once I complete the refinement of the five viscera, my lifespan will be able to crush the Fusion Spiritual Realm cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"As for my strength, I should not be weaker than the average Transformation Realm cultivator at this point!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered.</p><p></p><p>When he was able to slay the Godly Unorthodox in the past, his strength should have been at the peak of the Fusion Spiritual Realm, equivalent to a top-tier True Meaning Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>But at that time, Gu Qingfeng had not yet perfected his marrow cleansing, nor had he refined his viscera.</p><p></p><p>Each perfect refinement would allow him to transcend the ordinary, elevating his life realm to a higher level, while also transforming his strength.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Qingfeng was confident that his current strength was sufficient to rival the Transformation Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Taiyang Sword Sect only had one Transformation Realm cultivator as the Sect Master openly. Even if there were other powerful ones in hiding, the number of Transformation Realm cultivators would not be too many.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Transformation Realm cultivators did not emerge, Gu Qingfeng was confident in dealing with any situation.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Transformation Realm cultivators were to make a move, he might not necessarily be at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, there is no absolute certainty in anything, so being cautious is just about right.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's actions sought stability, but not to the extent of being cowardly.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng began to re-comprehend and refine the martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Most of his time was now spent in the Grinding Hall, trying to create a truly perfect martial art.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Gu Qingfeng had gained some insights, although he had not yet taken the first step, but at least he had found a direction to move forward.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>In the dense forest valley, a military camp had been established.</p><p></p><p>This was a place that Gu Yang had secretly found and used for training the soldiers.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there were 100,000 troops in this military camp.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang stood on the command platform, looking at the 100,000 troops below, the silent and deadly aura permeating the area, igniting a heroic spirit within him.</p><p></p><p>This was Gu Yang's foundation.</p><p></p><p>And the capital for his future conquest of the world.</p><p></p><p>All the soldiers who had entered the military camp were carefully selected by Gu Yang. They had some talent in the martial dao, and the weakest among them had reached the Refining Skin Realm.</p><p></p><p>Some of the stronger ones had even stepped into the Refining Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention anything else, just the 100,000 Refining Skin Realm martial artists alone would be a terrifying force.</p><p></p><p>After all, many soldiers only had some martial prowess without truly entering the martial dao realm. 100,000 troops who had entered the martial dao, this kind of power would be considered elite no matter where they were placed.</p><p></p><p>"My fellow soldiers, the 100,000 Divine Martial Army is now marching towards the White Stone Path. As the saying goes, 'Cultivate an army for a thousand days and use it in a single moment.' Now is the time to test the fruits of our efforts!"</p><p></p><p>"For each enemy head you slay, you will be rewarded with 10 taels of silver. Slay 10 enemies, and you will be promoted to a Centurion and rewarded with 100 taels of silver, as well as a high-grade martial art. Slay 100 enemies, and you will be promoted to a Chiliarch and rewarded with 1,000 taels of silver, as well as an exceptional martial art."</p><p></p><p>"If you can slay 200 enemies, you will be promoted to a Myriad Commander, rewarded with 30,000 taels of silver, and granted a supreme martial art!"</p><p></p><p>As Gu Yang's words fell, the 100,000 soldiers all had a burning desire in their eyes, the longing for the rewards clearly visible on their faces.</p><p></p><p>10 taels of silver for one enemy head! 100 taels of silver for 10 enemy heads!</p><p>1,000 taels of silver for 100 enemy heads!</p><p></p><p>Many could already see the shimmering silver in front of them, not to mention the additional rewards of promotions and top-tier martial arts.</p><p></p><p>In these chaotic times...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The key was to achieve great accomplishments and establish a career.</p><p></p><p>Now that Gu Yang had made such a promise, it had greatly boosted the morale of the troops.</p><p></p><p>"Fight!"</p><p></p><p>"Fight!!"</p><p></p><p>"Fight!! Fight!!"</p><p></p><p>Someone let out a loud and angry shout, and immediately the vast military camp was filled with thunderous cries, the morale soaring high.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene before him, Gu Yang was inwardly satisfied.</p><p></p><p>The foundation of strength was there.</p><p></p><p>The will to fight and the high morale were also there.</p><p></p><p>Even if they had not been baptized in the blood of battle, these were truly soldiers ready for war.</p><p></p><p>As long as they survived this coming battle, the ones left standing would be the true elite.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>A secret guard came forward and respectfully reported, "Master, the Divine Might Army is now less than a hundred li from the Northern Gate Pass, and I believe they will arrive in less than half a day!"</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang nodded, and with a sweep of his hand, the hundred thousand-strong army set out towards the Northern Gate Pass.</p><p></p><p>As the main force moved out,</p><p></p><p>The vast White Stone Road trembled.</p><p></p><p>In these past years, although Gu Yang had been making moves, he had been operating in the shadows, training the army in secret, so that others were completely unaware of the formidable force he had cultivated.</p><p></p><p>Until now.</p><p></p><p>When the hundred thousand troops marched out of the camp towards the Northern Gate Pass, the various powers finally realized that the Gu Family Manor had been secretly amassing such a terrifying force all along.</p><p></p><p>In these chaotic times, the purpose of training such a large army was self-evident.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"A hundred thousand troops, the Gu Family Manor must be harboring thoughts of rebellion!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, what rebellion? The Great Xuan Dynasty is already on the verge of collapse, where is there still talk of rebellion?"</p><p></p><p>"That's true, I had thought the Gu Family Manor, as an esteemed clan, would remain aloof from the turmoil, but it seems they too have ambitions of vying for the throne."</p><p></p><p>"Vying for the throne is easier said than done, one misstep and it could lead to utter ruin. A hundred thousand troops may seem formidable, but they are still just that."</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that this time the Divine Might Army is coming with overwhelming force, not only is Pei Jing personally leading the troops, but there are also experts from the Tian Yang Sword Sect accompanying them. Whether the Gu Family Manor can withstand this remains to be seen."</p><p></p><p>The various powers and warriors on the White Stone Road were all discussing animatedly, and the majority of them were not very optimistic about Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>It was simple.</p><p></p><p>Prince Pei Jing of the Divine Might Kingdom commanded territories spanning several prefectures, and his army was invincible. Even the hundred thousand elite troops Gu Yang had mustered would be hard-pressed to match them.</p><p></p><p>So, as news of the Divine Might Army's approach spread, many of the jianghu factions were secretly waiting, ready to immediately pledge allegiance to the Divine Might Army as soon as the Gu Family Manor was defeated, to avoid being implicated.</p><p></p><p>As for the rumors circulating outside, Gu Yang paid them no heed.</p><p></p><p>As long as they emerged victorious from this battle, any gossip and slander would be self-refuting.</p><p></p><p>But if they were to be defeated,</p><p></p><p>Then the rumors would no longer matter.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that this battle would determine the future and survival of the entire Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>They had to win! They could not afford to lose! Even though Gu Yang had great confidence in his heart, he couldn't help but feel a bit anxious at this critical juncture.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>When he felt the Zhu Xie Dao at his back, his sense of anxiety dissipated considerably.</p><p></p><p>With his father by his side,</p><p></p><p>The sky would not fall.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

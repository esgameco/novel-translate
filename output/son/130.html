        <h1>Chapter 130</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Master has lived for 800 years!"</p><p></p><p>"But the Fusion Spiritual Realm cultivators only have 1,500 years of lifespan."</p><p></p><p>"I have not yet perfected the refinement of my five viscera, but my lifespan has already reached 1,400 years, not much less than the Fusion Spiritual Realm cultivators. Once I complete the refinement of the five viscera, my lifespan will be able to crush the Fusion Spiritual Realm cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"As for my strength, I should not be weaker than the average Transformation Realm cultivator now!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered.</p><p></p><p>When he was able to slay the Godly Immortal Dao in the past, his strength should have been at the peak of the Fusion Spiritual Realm, equivalent to a top-tier True Meaning Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>But at that time,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had not yet perfected the marrow cleansing, nor had he refined his viscera.</p><p></p><p>Each perfect refinement would allow him to transcend the mundane, elevating his life realm to a higher level, while also transforming his strength.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was confident that his current strength could match the Transformation Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p></p><p>the Taiyang Sword Sect only had one Transformation Realm cultivator as the Sect Master on the surface. Even if there were other powerful ones hidden, the number of Transformation Realm cultivators would not be too many.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Transformation Realm cultivators do not emerge,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng is confident in dealing with any situation.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Transformation Realm cultivators make a move, he may not necessarily be at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>Additionally,</p><p></p><p>there is no absolute certainty in anything, and it's just about being reasonably prepared.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng seeks stability in his actions, he is not to the point of being overly cautious.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng began to ponder and explore the martial arts again.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, he spends most of his time in the Whetstone Hall, trying to create a truly perfect martial art.</p><p></p><p>At this point,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has gained some insights, although he has not yet taken the first step, but at least he has found a direction to move forward.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>In the dense forest valley, a military camp has been established.</p><p></p><p>This is a place that Gu Yang secretly found and used for training the soldiers.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>there are 100,000 troops in this military camp.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang stood on the command platform, looking at the 100,000 troops below, the silent and deadly aura permeating the area, igniting a heroic spirit within him.</p><p></p><p>This is Gu Yang's foundation.</p><p></p><p>And the capital for his future conquest of the world.</p><p></p><p>All the soldiers who have entered this military camp have been carefully selected by Gu Yang. They possess some talent in the martial dao, and the weakest among them have already reached the Refining Skin Realm.</p><p></p><p>Some of the stronger ones have even stepped into the Refining Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention anything else,</p><p></p><p>just the 100,000 Refining Skin Realm martial artists alone would be a terrifying force. </p><p></p><p>After all, many soldiers only have some martial prowess, without truly entering the martial dao realm. Let alone 100,000 troops who have all stepped into the martial dao, such a force would be considered elite no matter where they are placed.</p><p></p><p>"My fellow soldiers, the 100,000 Divine Martial Army is now marching towards the Baishi Road. As the saying goes, 'Cultivate an army for a thousand days, and use it in a single moment.' Now is the time to test the fruits of our efforts!"</p><p></p><p>"For this battle, anyone who beheads one person will be rewarded with 10 taels of silver. Beheading 10 people will be rewarded with 100 taels of silver and the title of Centurion, along with a high-grade martial art. Beheading 100 people will be rewarded with 1,000 taels of silver and the title of Chiliarch, along with an exceptional martial art."</p><p></p><p>"If anyone can behead 200 people, they will be rewarded with 30,000 taels of silver and the title of Myriad Troop Commander, as well as a supreme martial art!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's voice resounded, and in an instant, the 100,000 soldiers all had a burning desire in their eyes, the longing for the rewards clearly visible on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Beheading one person for 10 taels of silver! Beheading 10 people for 100 taels of silver!</p><p></p><p>Beheading 100 people for 1,000 taels of silver!</p><p></p><p>Many of them could already see the gleaming silver in front of them, not to mention the additional rewards of promotions and top-tier martial arts.</p><p></p><p>In these chaotic times...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The key was to accomplish great deeds and establish a legacy. </p><p></p><p>Now that Gu Yang had made such a promise, it had greatly boosted the morale of the troops.</p><p></p><p>"Fight!"</p><p>"Fight!!"</p><p>"Fight!! Fight!!"</p><p></p><p>Someone let out a loud and angry shout, and immediately the vast military camp was filled with thunderous cries, the soldiers' morale soaring high.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene before him, Gu Yang was inwardly satisfied.</p><p></p><p>The foundation of strength was there.</p><p>The will to fight was there as well.</p><p></p><p>Even if they had not been baptized in the blood of battle, these were truly troops ready for war.</p><p></p><p>As long as they survived this coming battle, the ones left standing would be the true elite.</p><p></p><p>Just then, </p><p>a secret guard came forward and respectfully reported, "Master, the Divine Might Army is less than a hundred li from the North Gate Pass, and I believe they will arrive in less than half a day!"</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang nodded, and with a sweep of his hand, the hundred thousand-strong army set out towards the North Gate Pass.</p><p></p><p>As the main force moved out,</p><p>the vast White Stone Road trembled.</p><p></p><p>In these past years, although Gu Yang had been discreet in his actions, training the large army in secret, the others were completely unaware that he had cultivated such a formidable force.</p><p></p><p>Until now.</p><p></p><p>When the hundred thousand troops marched out of the camp towards the North Gate Pass, the various powers finally realized that the Gu Family Manor had been secretly amassing such a terrifying strength all along.</p><p></p><p>In these chaotic times, the purpose of training such a large army was self-evident.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"A hundred thousand troops, the Gu Family Manor must be harboring thoughts of rebellion!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, what rebellion? The Great Xuan Dynasty is already on the verge of collapse, where is there still room for rebellion?"</p><p></p><p>"That's true, I had thought the Gu Family Manor, as an eminent clan, would remain aloof from the turmoil, but it seems they too have ambitions of vying for the realm."</p><p></p><p>"Vying for the realm is easier said than done, for a single misstep could lead to utter ruin. While the hundred thousand troops appear mighty, they are still just that - a single army."</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that this time the Divine Might Army is coming with great force, not only is Pei Jing personally leading the troops, but there are also experts from the Tian Yang Sword Sect accompanying them. Whether the Gu Family Manor can withstand this remains to be seen."</p><p></p><p>The various powers and martial artists on the White Stone Road were all discussing animatedly, and the majority of them were not very optimistic about Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>It was simple.</p><p>Pei Jing, the Divine Might King, commanded territories spanning several commanderies, and his army was invincible. Even the hundred thousand elite troops Gu Yang had mustered would be hard-pressed to match them.</p><p></p><p>As the news of the Divine Might Army's approach spread, many of the jianghu factions were quietly waiting, ready to immediately pledge allegiance to the Divine Might Army the moment the Gu Family Manor fell, to avoid being implicated.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang paid no heed to the outside rumors.</p><p>As long as they emerged victorious from this battle, any and all slander would be rendered meaningless.</p><p></p><p>But if they were to be defeated...</p><p>Then the rumors would no longer matter.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that this battle would determine the very future and survival of the entire Gu Family Manor.</p><p>They had to win, they could not afford to lose. Even though Gu Yang was confident, he couldn't help but feel a sense of nervousness.</p><p></p><p>However, </p><p>when he felt the Zhu Xie Dao at his back, that anxious feeling dissipated greatly.</p><p></p><p>With his father by his side,</p><p>the sky would not fall.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 100</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was increasingly driven to improve his own strength.</p><p></p><p>He didn't care at all about the changes in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Qingfeng had anticipated, many prominent families and sects in Guangyang Prefecture suffered heavy losses, with numerous powerful experts falling at the hands of the evil Buddha.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the martial arts forces in the Guangyang Prefecture had suddenly declined significantly.</p><p></p><p>In these chaotic times, territory and resources were of utmost importance. </p><p></p><p>When the strength of Guangyang Prefecture declined, other martial arts forces outside of Guangyang began to covet this place, secretly dispatching people to infiltrate and gradually encroach upon it.</p><p></p><p>The thousand-year-old family sects under Guangyang Prefecture would not agree to this.</p><p></p><p>After all, these sects had taken root here for many years, and if they allowed other external forces to encroach, it would be undermining their own foundations.</p><p></p><p>They could not tolerate this situation.</p><p></p><p>Conflict was inevitable! Although Guangyang Prefecture had suffered heavy losses in martial arts strength, its deep heritage of a thousand years could still barely stabilize the situation for the time being.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, there were also other forces wanting to intervene in the White Stone Path.</p><p></p><p>However, after Gu Qingfeng personally stepped in with thunderous might, slaying several powerful experts, the reputation of the Tyrannical Saber once again spread, causing the various martial arts forces wanting to encroach on the White Stone Path to once again meet with failure.</p><p></p><p>The awe-inspiring reputation of a Half-Saint Master was truly not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the White Stone Path's ranking within Guangyang Prefecture was not very high, and its control over resources was extremely limited. It was not worthwhile for them to fight to the death with a Half-Saint Master just for the White Stone Path.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, two years had passed.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the Gu Family Manor was brightly decorated, with guests coming and going endlessly.</p><p></p><p>This was the day of the young master of the Gu Family's wedding.</p><p></p><p>At the banquet, many renowned martial arts forces of Guangyang Prefecture had come.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the one marrying the young master of the Gu Family this time is an ordinary and common woman!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, I heard that many forces wanted to marry into the Gu Family, but the young master didn't take a liking to any of them. That woman being able to marry into the Gu Family is probably truly flying up to become a phoenix!"</p><p></p><p>"In recent years, the reputation of the Gu Family has become increasingly renowned, and everyone knows the name of the Tyrannical Saber, Gu Qingfeng. Just look at the chaotic situation in Guangyang Prefecture, yet the White Stone Path remains stable as ever!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I wonder what kind of celestial being was able to be taken in by the young master..."</p><p></p><p>At the banquet, many people were whispering and discussing, mostly expressing envy towards the woman who had married into the Gu Family.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Gu Family was now an undisputed top force.</p><p></p><p>At least in the small realm of Guangyang Prefecture, the Gu Family's reputation was resounding, not inferior to those thousand-year-old family sects.</p><p></p><p>A Half-Saint Master was no joke.</p><p></p><p>Many forces wanted to marry into the Gu Family to strengthen their foundations, but they never had the chance.</p><p></p><p>Unlike other forces, with the Gu Family's current status, they could choose to either marry into other forces to expand their foundations, or seek stable development on their own.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Tyrannical Saber did not die, who would dare to harm the Gu Family?</p><p></p><p>"The newlyweds have arrived!"</p><p></p><p>When this voice sounded, all the discussions fell silent as everyone turned their gaze towards a certain direction. There, a pair of newlyweds were slowly walking in.</p><p></p><p>The man had an upright bearing, with sharp brows and bright eyes, exuding an aura of heroism.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Everyone secretly admired him, saying, "What a fine young master!" However, they all knew that although this young master of the Gu family appeared handsome and amiable, his methods were extremely ruthless, and many martial artists in the jianghu had met their demise at his hands despite their young fame.</p><p></p><p>As for the other person, their face was temporarily obscured by the red veil, so it was not yet clear what they looked like. But occasionally, when the breeze blew, the veil would lift slightly, revealing a rather delicate and pretty face. When people saw this face, many were visibly disappointed.</p><p></p><p>It was not that the woman was ugly. In terms of appearance, she was quite decent. But compared to the young master of the Gu family, she seemed a bit unworthy.</p><p></p><p>"First, pay respects to heaven and earth! Second, pay respects to the elders! Third, the bride and groom bow to each other! The ceremony is complete!"</p><p></p><p>The entire wedding process went smoothly without any unexpected incidents. Gu Qingfeng, sitting in the main seat, looked at the couple before him with a hint of contentment. To be frank, Gu Yang was someone he had personally raised. Now, seeing his son start a family, as the father, he could not help but feel a sense of gratification.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Xu Yulan also had a smile on her face, her beauty having blossomed even more over the past few years.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has established his own family (can only be triggered once)!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +30 Attribute Points!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression changed slightly as he saw the message appear on the information panel. He was somewhat surprised, but mostly felt at ease. Indeed, the establishment of the next generation's family was a significant event, and the reward of 30 Attribute Points was quite generous. With this, he would be able to accomplish many things.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The banquet lasted for a full seven days before the guests finally dispersed, and the once lively Gu family manor returned to its usual tranquility. Gu Qingfeng sat alone in the Grinding Hall, his gaze fixed on his own attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng</p><p>Age: 39/200</p><p>Cultivation: Refining the Viscera Second Realm</p><p>Martial Arts: Gu Family Fist (Unbreakable Level 1), Iron Body Technique (Iron Body Level 1), Great Slamming Boulder Hand (Perfected), Iron Leg Technique (Perfected), Refining Iron Finger (Perfected), Scorching Sun Divine Palm (Scorching Palm Qi Level 4), Heaven Thunder Sword Technique (Beginner), Hundred Temperings Golden Body (Unbreakable Body Level 9), Seven Killing Blade Art (Killing Intent Level 2), Heaven Canopy Invincible Body (Protective Qi Level 4), Heaven Canopy Divine Body (Indestructible Divine Body Level 1), Pure Yang Technique (Ninth Layer Perfected, Pure Yang Qi and Blood Level 8), Five Viscera Classic (Second Layer, Five Viscera Like Gods Level 2), Primordial Treasure Mirror (Second Layer, Refining Viscera Like Iron, Level 2), Tyrant Blade Slash (Minor Success, Tyrant Blade Intent Level 7)</p><p></p><p>Attribute Points: 34</p><p></p><p>In the past two years, Gu Qingfeng's overall changes were not too significant. Neither the Five Viscera Classic nor the Primordial Treasure Mirror had seen much breakthrough, as refining the viscera was a step-by-step process that required meticulous cultivation without any accidents, lest it lead to severe injuries or even death. And since Gu Qingfeng's natural talent was not exceptional, his progress in this area was limited.</p><p></p><p>However, in the aspect of the Pure Yang Technique, Gu Qingfeng had managed to cultivate it to the Perfected stage over the past two years.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 81</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng could sense that Gu Yang's murderous intent had become much more intense.</p><p></p><p>"Fight fire with fire!"</p><p></p><p>"What you say is not wrong."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had a strong killing nature, but he was not inherently bloodthirsty. In the current chaotic world, pure benevolence could be the most fatal.</p><p></p><p>If one harbored murderous intent, it was not necessarily a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>So, Gu Qingfeng did not continue persuading him, but instead let Gu Yang go cultivate well, and keep an eye on the happenings in the jianghu. If there were any problems he couldn't resolve, he could come inform Gu Qingfeng immediately.</p><p></p><p>To this, Gu Yang readily agreed, and then bowed and took his leave.</p><p></p><p>Not long after Gu Yang left, Xu Yulan gracefully and elegantly walked over. Her already beautiful countenance seemed to have gained even more charm as her cultivation progressed.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Yangzi's murderous intent has become a bit too strong!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yulan said softly as she approached Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng glanced at her and then shook his head with a faint smile. "It doesn't matter if his murderous intent is strong. In this chaotic world, not the prosperous era, as Yangzi said, the only way is to fight fire with fire!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Yulan also nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"What my husband says is also correct. However, Yangzi's cultivation is still weak. If he encounters some powerful experts, it may cause trouble. As my husband's identity is important, he cannot easily take action. Should I step forward and lend a hand?"</p><p></p><p>She had now tempered her iron bones to the point of being at the half-step Refining Bones realm, though she had not yet fully entered the Refining Bones realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "Although you have reached the half-step Refining Bones realm, you may still not be Yangzi's match. He recently slew an expert at the true Refining Bones realm."</p><p></p><p>"Slew an expert at the Refining Bones realm!" Xu Yulan's expression changed, surprised.</p><p></p><p>She had not expected Gu Yang's strength to be so formidable.</p><p></p><p>These days, Xu Yulan had only learned that the White Stone Dao was in some chaos, and Gu Yang was leading the disciples of the Gu Family Manor to suppress the unrest outside. That's why she had come, wanting to also contribute her share.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the help of the Breakthrough Pill, Xu Yulan felt her strength was not weak.</p><p></p><p>But now that Gu Yang could slay an expert at the Refining Bones realm, she, at the half-step Refining Bones realm, seemed a bit inadequate.</p><p></p><p>"The affairs of the jianghu can be handled by us. You should just stay and focus on tempering your iron bones to perfection, and enter the Refining Bones realm."</p><p></p><p>"As my husband says."</p><p></p><p>"How are Xuan'er and Xiu'er doing now?"</p><p></p><p>"They are both sleeping. The children are young and tend to sleep more, but with my husband's guidance in cultivating their physical foundation, they are more robust than ordinary children."</p><p></p><p>When mentioning Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu, a maternal tenderness could be seen in Xu Yulan's bright eyes.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "The children are still young. When they are a few years older, we can start them on martial arts cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, Yangzi is not young either. In a few more years, it will be time for him to take a wife. Now that Yangzi has killed so much, if he can find a virtuous wife, it may help resolve some of the killing intent in his heart."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yulan suddenly changed the topic.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression also became serious. "What you say, I have also thought about, but I haven't found a suitable match yet."</p><p></p><p>"If my husband trusts me, I can take care of this matter."</p><p></p><p>"If the Mistress is willing to take charge of this, that would be best."</p><p></p><p>Hearing that Xu Yulan was willing to handle this, Gu Qingfeng naturally had no objections. After all, these trivial matters were a bit of a headache for Gu Qingfeng to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yulan's ability to come forward was different.</p><p></p><p>Women.</p><p></p><p>They are often more meticulous.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>In the following few days, Gu Qingfeng continued to ponder the Hegemon Saber Slash, as well as cultivate the Azure Yang Technique and the Five Viscera Classic.</p><p></p><p>Then after that, he used the Nurturing Saber Art to cultivate the Slaying Evil Saber.</p><p></p><p>The ten Marrow Cleansing Elixirs that Gu Yang had broken through and obtained, Gu Qingfeng had already consumed them all. The Marrow Cleansing Elixir was indeed one level higher than the Refining Bone Elixir.</p><p></p><p>Even with Gu Qingfeng's current cultivation level, consuming the Marrow Cleansing Elixir could still enhance his own strength.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, in terms of foundation alone, Gu Qingfeng suspected that he could even be on par with Refining Viscera Third Realm, or even Refining Viscera Fourth Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>If he went all out, he might even have the ability to contend with Refining Viscera Fifth Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for whether he could match a Patriarch, Gu Qingfeng did not know for sure at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Because, the Patriarch experts, Gu Qingfeng had only heard of them, but had not truly seen them.</p><p></p><p>With the breakthrough to Refining Viscera Second Realm, Gu Qingfeng found that his cultivation of the Azure Yang Technique also seemed to have become much faster. The Azure Yang Technique, which had previously reached the Fifth Layer of Initial Success, broke through to the Great Success in less than a few days.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, it would not take long for him to step into the Sixth Layer.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, in terms of cultivating the Five Viscera Classic, Gu Qingfeng still had not made much progress.</p><p></p><p>Reaching Refining Viscera Third Realm, he still had no clue whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>For this reason, Gu Qingfeng did not hesitate to ponder the Primordial Precious Mirror, hoping to find a way to break through the Refining Viscera Third Realm from it.</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Qingfeng was originally at the Refining Viscera Second Realm, the cultivation of the Primordial Precious Mirror was also much easier for him.</p><p></p><p>In less than a few days, the first layer of the Primordial Precious Mirror was successfully cultivated.</p><p></p><p>From this point, Gu Qingfeng also discovered another problem.</p><p></p><p>That is, although the Refining Viscera Profound Arts are difficult to enter, once one has entered, the difficulty of cultivating the same level of martial arts on the path one has walked before will directly drop to the freezing point.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the previous Five Viscera Classic or the current Primordial Precious Mirror, they were all like this.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Primordial Precious Mirror, to a certain extent, is quite similar to the Five Viscera Classic. Even after successfully cultivating the first two layers, it did not bring much change to his own strength.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Five Viscera Classic is indeed a top-tier Refining Viscera Profound Art. The tempering of the viscera by such a martial art has already reached a near-perfect degree."</p><p></p><p>"It is precisely because the viscera are perfected that the cultivation of the Primordial Precious Mirror has not brought much enhancement."</p><p></p><p>"In the past, the cultivation of other martial arts could bring enhancements to the qi and blood, and changes to the physical body, because these martial arts were not truly perfect and flawless, and the human body had not been fully developed to the extreme."</p><p></p><p>"If the cultivator's physical body is truly developed to the extreme, with each step perfectly tempered, then even the accumulation of lower-level martial arts would be useless!"</p><p></p><p>From the Primordial Precious Mirror, Gu Qingfeng gained some new insights into the Dao of Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, his physical body has not yet reached true perfection.</p><p></p><p>Only by refining various martial arts and continuously consolidating his foundation can he truly become perfect and flawless.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Gu Qingfeng believed that his strength would undergo a qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost there!"</p><p></p><p>"At my current speed, I believe it won't take long for my physical body to reach perfection!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

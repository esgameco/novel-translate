        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>For the past half a month, intelligence from the Central Plains has been constantly reaching Gu Qingfeng's hands. </p><p></p><p>Regarding the fact that Ji Chunqiu had reached the half-step Transcendent Realm, Gu Qingfeng was also somewhat surprised, but he soon became at ease with it.</p><p></p><p>During this period, the information panel has also been constantly refreshing with new text.</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has received guidance from a Grand Master, and his cultivation has made some progress!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has broken through to the Refine Bone Realm and reached perfection!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 100 Promotion Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 100 Refine Bone Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 100 Marrow Cleansing Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 10 Refine Viscera Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has led the Guangyang Army to conquer cities and plunder, greatly increasing his reputation!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by 6 Transcendent Realm cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has received guidance from a Grand Master, and his cultivation has improved slightly."</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When he saw that Gu Yang had broken through to the perfect Refine Bone Realm, Gu Qingfeng's expression did not change much. </p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Yang now has a large amount of resources at his disposal, and he has also received guidance from a Dao Grand Master, so his breakthrough in cultivation is only natural.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, if Gu Yang had not made any progress in his cultivation, that would have been truly surprising.</p><p></p><p>Now that Gu Yang has broken through, Gu Qingfeng directly poured the extra 100 Promotion Points into the Pure Yang True Body.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, this Grand Master technique was upgraded from the initial stage to the perfect level by Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"The Pure Yang True Body has reached perfection!"</p><p>"The Flesh Body has reached the 4th level of Purity Yang!"</p><p>"This technique is indeed extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>After the Pure Yang True Body reached perfection, Gu Qingfeng felt the terrifying pure yang qi and blood within him, and his expression showed some surprise.</p><p></p><p>If this pure yang qi and blood power were cultivated by others, even if it could not trigger a breakthrough in their life realm, it could still make the cultivator's qi and blood far stronger than ordinary Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>This shows that the expert who created the Pure Yang True Body had extraordinary vision and strength.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Pure Yang True Body could only be considered an ordinary Grand Master technique, as it could not trigger a breakthrough in the cultivator's life realm.</p><p></p><p>At most, it is just a powerful Grand Master technique, but has not reached a higher level of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, the perfection of the Pure Yang True Body has made Gu Qingfeng's qi and blood much more refined, although it has not reached the level of breaking through the Extreme Dao Grandmaster realm, it is still stronger than before.</p><p></p><p>"To break through the Extreme Dao Grandmaster realm, I still need some accumulation!"</p><p></p><p>"But as long as I have enough Grand Master techniques, the difficulty of improving my cultivation in the Extreme Dao Grandmaster realm is not too great!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Normally, to take a martial art from the initial stage to perfection only requires 200 Promotion Points.</p><p></p><p>200 Promotion Points, while not a small amount, is also not too much. At the current rate of progress, it should take about one or two years to accumulate enough.</p><p></p><p>The biggest problem is that higher-level martial arts are difficult to obtain, and can only be improved through the method of breaking limits.</p><p></p><p>Martial art limit breaking, the consumption required is beyond normal comprehension.</p><p></p><p>For example, for a Grand Master martial art, the normal promotion only requires 50 Promotion Points, but if it is to be broken through the limit, the requirement is ten times that.</p><p></p><p>Such consumption is self-evident.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng's gaze fell on the various martial arts in the Whetstone Hall.</p><p></p><p>Since the extermination of the Tian Yang Sword Sect and the conquest of the various prefectures of Qingyan State by the Guangyang Army, Gu Yang has been constantly confiscating martial arts from all over the world and sending them here.</p><p></p><p>But because Gu Qingfeng currently has requirements, he does not want any martial arts below the Grand Master level, so the martial arts sent by Gu Yang are mostly Grand Master martial arts.</p><p></p><p>These Grand Master martial arts include sword techniques, fist techniques, as well as other internal cultivation methods and body refining techniques.</p><p></p><p>However, most of these techniques are not worthy of Gu Qingfeng's attention, and if he were to cultivate them, they would basically be placed at the end.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Gu Qingfeng's gaze fell on a martial art.</p><p></p><p>The Refine Blood True Classic! A Grand Master martial art! This was obtained by Gu Yang after the extermination of the Tian Yang Sword Sect, a truly top-tier martial art.</p><p></p><p>This technique is similar to the Pure Yang True Body, both focusing on refining the cultivator's qi and blood, and the "Refine Blood" in the Refine Blood True Classic refers to refining the cultivator's blood to possess terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>According to the records in the Refine Blood True Classic, if a cultivator can refine their blood to a sufficiently terrifying level, they may even be able to achieve the feat of "Dripping Blood Resurrection".</p><p></p><p>However, the so-called "Dripping Blood Resurrection" is merely a conjecture of the creator of this technique.</p><p></p><p>After all, even a Grand Master martial art, no matter how it is cultivated to the highest level of perfection, cannot truly achieve the feat of "Dripping Blood Resurrection".</p><p></p><p>"Dripping Blood Resurrection, the imagination of the creator of this technique is not bad, but relying on a Grand Master martial art to achieve this is a bit far-fetched.</p><p></p><p>However, if a Grand Master cannot do it, perhaps those above the Grand Master realm may be able to, as there is no absolute impossibility in such matters."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng thought of the drop of blood that gave birth to the Jiuqu Dao Demonic Buddha.</p><p></p><p>A single drop of blood had such divine power, perhaps those extraordinary experts could truly master the method of "Dripping Blood Resurrection" as the creator of the Refine Blood True Classic had imagined.</p><p></p><p>But these matters are too distant for Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After all, when it truly comes to the point of a blood-curdling rebirth, it is likely that one's own self has already transcended the mortal realm, reaching the supreme realm on par with immortal deities.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng carefully studied the Refining Blood Classics, thoroughly memorizing the profound mysteries of this martial art.</p><p></p><p>In a moment.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took another look at the attribute panel, only to find that the Refining Blood Classics had been successfully recorded.</p><p></p><p>The Refining Blood Classics is divided into eight layers.</p><p></p><p>The first four layers correspond to the four stages from the initial to the perfect realm of a Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>The latter four layers correspond to the four stages from the initial to the perfect realm of a Great Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the Refining Blood Classics is a truly top-tier Great Grandmaster martial art.</p><p></p><p>After all, among Great Grandmaster martial arts, some can only allow the practitioner to break through to the initial Great Grandmaster realm, while the Refining Blood Classics can directly allow the martial artist to break through to the perfect Great Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, the higher the ceiling of a martial art, the more precious it is.</p><p></p><p>"The Tian Yang Sword Sect being able to obtain such a top-tier martial art, it is estimated that the Great Grandmaster who created the Refining Blood Classics must have fallen at the hands of the Tian Yang Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Even the top Martial Dao Great Grandmasters are ultimately no match for the profound foundations of these immortal sects!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took a deep breath, and his heart also calmed down.</p><p></p><p>One step short.</p><p></p><p>Step by step short.</p><p></p><p>This world's Martial Dao has deficiencies, and this has destined that martial artists are not as capable as mages.</p><p></p><p>The innate deficiencies, trying to make up for them later on can be extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>The Five Realms of Body Refinement.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Qingfeng's view, this is the most important step in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Only by building a perfect and complete foundation in these five realms can a martial artist go further.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, the foundational basis also represents the combat power of martial artists at the same realm.</p><p></p><p>Like two Martial Dao Great Grandmasters, one who has completed the Five Realms of Body Refinement in a perfect state, and the other who has deficiencies in the Five Realms, the latter would naturally be no match for the former.</p><p></p><p>Even.</p><p></p><p>The former can easily crush the latter.</p><p></p><p>This is the fundamental difference between a solid foundation and a weak one.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Gu Qingfeng's attention returned to the severed finger.</p><p></p><p>As he continued to ponder the Inextinguishable Blade Intent on the finger, Gu Qingfeng gained new insights into the Heaven Blade Dao he had created, and the Twelve Levels of Heaven Blade True Intent had also become much stronger than before.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng believed that as long as he gave himself more time, breaking through the Heaven Blade True Intent to the Thirteenth Level should not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>If the Heaven Blade True Intent could break through to the Thirteenth Level, then Gu Qingfeng would have truly created a top-tier Great Grandmaster blade art.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng's thoughts delved into that Inextinguishable Blade Intent, a powerful and domineering blade intent began to emanate from him.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the entire Whetstone Hall was enveloped by this terrifying blade intent.</p><p></p><p>The Demon-Slaying Blade that had been returned by Gu Yang, under the cover of this powerful blade intent, trembled slightly, as if a strong aura was being released, intimidating all other divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>In the Central Plains.</p><p></p><p>The capital city had been completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>It had become a vast ruin.</p><p></p><p>Countless bodies were piled up here, both from the imperial troops and the rebel soldiers.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>In the imperial palace, a terrifying fluctuation erupted.</p><p></p><p>After a long while.</p><p></p><p>This fluctuation subsided.</p><p></p><p>Only to see Emperor Jie Chunqiu's imperial robe stained with blood, his majestic eyes filled with cold-blooded killing intent, and before him, the powerful experts from the immortal sects and noble families had gathered.</p><p></p><p>Taixuan Master tightly grasped the head of an Imperial Clan Great Grandmaster, his expression ice-cold as he looked at Jie Chunqiu.</p><p></p><p>"Jie Chunqiu, you have been defeated. Now, if you are willing to surrender and await your fate, I can leave a bloodline for the Imperial Clan. If you insist on fighting to the end, the Imperial Clan will be completely wiped out from this day forward."</p><p></p><p>"Why waste so many words? Even though I have been defeated, I will make you all pay the price!"</p><p></p><p>Jie Chunqiu's expression was cold, completely unfazed by Taixuan Master's words.</p><p></p><p>Surrender and await his fate.</p><p></p><p>That was absolutely impossible.</p><p></p><p>Even if a bloodline of the Imperial Clan could be preserved, it would only mean that the Imperial Clan would become the captive of others from this day on.</p><p></p><p>If preserving the bloodline required such a fate, it would be better to let the bloodline of the Imperial Clan be completely severed.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Taixuan Master's expression turned cold, and his five fingers suddenly tightened, causing the Great Grandmaster's head to instantly explode, and the headless body collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Kill him!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the killing intent in Jie Chunqiu's eyes erupted, and the terrifying power of the evil omen shook the nine heavens, with the eerie and cold spiritual energy ravaging everything. The originally powerful flesh and blood now appeared to be cracking, as if it would shatter at any moment.</p><p></p><p>This change was a sign of the imminent revival of the evil omen.</p><p></p><p>To this, Jie Chunqiu was unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>In this battle, he had never intended to survive.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, even if the evil omen revived, Jie Chunqiu now had only one thought - to slay all who dared to attack, and let the bloodline of the Imperial Clan perish with him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Jie Chunqiu's attack, the powerful aura made these experts all have grave expressions.</p><p></p><p>Taixuan Master roared, "What are you all hesitating for? Kill him, so that the Taixuan Dynasty will never exist again!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Taixuan Master was the first to strike, engaging in battle with Jie Chunqiu.</p><p></p><p>The other sect and noble family experts exchanged glances and also attacked simultaneously.

        <h1>Chapter 108</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His purpose in establishing the Gu Family Manor was to have a power base to gather cultivation resources, and also to cultivate his descendants.</p><p></p><p>Now, Gu Yang is doing well in all aspects, and the other party also has corresponding ambitions, so Gu Qingfeng naturally hands over this position to the other party.</p><p></p><p>It's just right.</p><p></p><p>Now, Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu are not too old, so Gu Yang directly becomes the new manor lord, which can also save a lot of disputes and troubles.</p><p></p><p>The next day, the news of the change of manor lord spread, causing some shock in the Gu Family Manor, but it did not cause too much of a stir.</p><p></p><p>After all, in recent years, most of the affairs in the manor have been handled by Gu Yang. In the eyes of many people, this young manor lord has already been designated as the next manor lord.</p><p></p><p>The news that has now been released is just formalizing this matter.</p><p></p><p>The only problem, perhaps, is that Gu Qingfeng's age is not too old. For cultivators, this age belongs to the prime of life. At this time, he steps down and lets others take over, which is somewhat unexpected.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng is not paying attention to these things now, but is looking at the information panel of his own.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has become the new manor lord of the Gu Family Manor, and he wishes to contend for the world, to achieve the feat of 'The Dragon Lies in the Abyss' (can only be triggered once)!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 100 Promotion Points!"</p><p>"Reward: 100 Bone Refining Elixirs!"</p><p>"Reward: 10 Marrow Cleansing Elixirs!"</p><p>"Reward: 5 Organ Refining Elixirs!"</p><p>"Reward: 100 Bloodline Realm Experts!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming rewards dazzle Gu Qingfeng's eyes. Under such generous rewards, even 100 Promotion Points seem to have become somewhat insignificant.</p><p></p><p>"Elixirs! Experts!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression changes slightly as he sees these two new things that have never appeared before.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, when he looks at the item list, he sees various elixirs stored there. As soon as the thought crosses his mind, corresponding information appears.</p><p></p><p>"Bone Refining Elixir: Consuming it can directly break through to the peak of the Bone Refining Realm."</p><p>"Marrow Cleansing Elixir: Consuming it can directly break through to the peak of the Marrow Cleansing Realm."</p><p>"Organ Refining Elixir: Consuming it can directly break through to the peak of the Organ Refining Realm."</p><p></p><p>In other words, these so-called Elixirs are the upgraded versions of Realm Breakthrough Pills.</p><p></p><p>Realm Breakthrough Pills can only allow one to break through a small realm with one use, but these Elixirs are even more extraordinary - consuming one can directly break through to the upper limit of the corresponding realm.</p><p></p><p>That is to say, this amount of Elixirs can instantly produce one hundred peak Bone Refining Realm cultivators, ten peak Marrow Cleansing Realm cultivators, and five peak Organ Refining Realm cultivators in the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Qingfeng has discovered his correct way of doing things.</p><p></p><p>Increasing the number of offspring is one aspect, but it is not just about treating them as tools to be raised. Rather, it is about giving them the freedom to grow on their own.</p><p></p><p>This extremely generous reward is enough to explain many things.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Gu Qingfeng's gaze falls on a token in the item list.</p><p></p><p>As he focuses his thoughts, the token appears in his palm.</p><p></p><p>"Death Warrior Token!"</p><p>"Crush it to instantly obtain one hundred absolutely loyal Death Warriors!"</p><p></p><p>Feeling the information appearing in his mind, Gu Qingfeng goes to the backyard, dismisses all the servants, and then forcefully crushes the token made of some unknown material.</p><p></p><p>As the token shatters, a black light surges forth.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A hundred elite assassins suddenly appeared out of nowhere, the entire process taking only a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, all the assassins knelt on one knee, fist-clenched and said in unison, "Your subordinates pay respects to the esteemed lord!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Qingfeng took a closer look at the assembled assassins.</p><p></p><p>All one hundred assassins were dressed in black clothes, their expressions cold and devoid of any extra emotion. They exuded an aura of icy coldness and murderous intent, like grim reapers harvesting lives in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>These one hundred assassins were all in the prime of their lives, and what's more, they were all at the Refining Blood Realm, a significant cultivation level. Most importantly, Gu Qingfeng felt a connection to these assassins, as if he could erase them with just a thought.</p><p></p><p>Absolute loyalty! </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Qingfeng finally understood the meaning of absolute loyalty.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, he looked towards the lead assassin.</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, you shall be known as Gu One, the commander of the assassins!"</p><p></p><p>"I will obey your command!" Gu One solemnly fist-clenched and said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng then bestowed names upon the other assassins, from Gu Two to Gu One Hundred, using numbers as their code names.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Two and Gu Three shall be the deputy commanders!" Gu Qingfeng announced.</p><p></p><p>Since the cultivation levels of the hundred assassins were roughly the same, it didn't matter much who became the commander. </p><p></p><p>To promote the three as commanders, Gu Qingfeng rewarded them with three Refining Impurity Realm promotion pills.</p><p></p><p>Then, Gu Qingfeng distributed ten Marrow Cleansing Realm promotion pills to the remaining ninety-seven assassins, as well as eighty-seven Refining Bone Realm promotion pills.</p><p></p><p>As the assassins consumed the pills, their auras suddenly surged. In just a few breaths, all the assassins had completed their breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>Three had reached the peak of the Refining Impurity Realm, ten had reached the Marrow Cleansing Realm, and eighty-seven had reached the Refining Bone Realm. This was a terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>At least within the Guangyang Prefecture, this force would be considered formidable.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng understood that these assassins only possessed the corresponding cultivation levels, but did not have any martial arts or techniques.</p><p></p><p>Compared to their peers, the assassins' actual strength would be at the lower end.</p><p></p><p>But this was not a major problem. </p><p></p><p>Now that they had the cultivation levels, mastering martial arts and techniques would be much easier.</p><p></p><p>And because the assassins were absolutely loyal, Gu Qingfeng did not hold back in imparting the Crimson Flame Divine Technique, the Gu Family's most supreme martial art, as the foundation for the assassins.</p><p></p><p>According to the advantages of the Crimson Flame Divine Technique, as long as they cultivated it to the ninth level of perfection, they would be able to naturally step into the tenth level and become Xiantian Grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>If all the assassins could cultivate the Crimson Flame Divine Technique to perfection, it would be equivalent to having one hundred Xiantian Grandmaster experts.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was the most ideal estimation.</p><p></p><p>In reality, Gu Qingfeng did not know the talents of these assassins, so how many of them could actually cultivate the Crimson Flame Divine Technique to perfection was unpredictable.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the Crimson Flame Divine Technique, Gu Qingfeng also passed down the Seven Killing Blade Technique.</p><p></p><p>This martial art was originally of the superior grade, but Gu Qingfeng had broken through its limits, making it comparable to the supreme grade.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Gu Qingfeng gave these assassins an official organizational name:</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guards!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

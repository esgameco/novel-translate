        <h1>Chapter 232</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators were rushing towards the entrance of the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>A powerful cultivator from the Daogong Realm was unwilling to give up, planning to forcefully enter the secret realm. But in the moment he was about to step into the secret realm, a terrifying aura of a Great Saint suddenly descended.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The Daogong Realm cultivator didn't even have time to react before being directly crushed by this power.</p><p></p><p>This scene made the other cultivators who were planning to forcefully enter the secret realm turn pale.</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint's secret realm! </p><p></p><p>It was indeed something they could not shake.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Great Saint of the Tienfeng had perished long ago, the power he left behind was still enough to slay all Daogong Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>So, although many Daogong Realm cultivators were unwilling, they could only suppress the urge in their hearts now.</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint's inheritance was good, but one had to be alive to obtain it.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Gu, I shall go first!" </p><p></p><p>Fu He cupped his hands and said.</p><p></p><p>Since only cultivators below the Daogong Realm could enter the Great Saint's secret realm, Fu He understood that his opportunity had arrived.</p><p></p><p>His Shenbian Realm ninth layer cultivation, while not considered top-tier among the cultivators present, would be different once inside the Great Saint's secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Great Saint's secret realm had opened in the Nine States, even if the news spread, it would still take time for the powerful experts from various forces to arrive.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, no one knew how long the entrance to the Great Saint's secret realm would remain open.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Fu He would not miss this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly: "Then I wish you the best of luck, Fellow Daoist Fu!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the kind words!" </p><p></p><p>Fu He laughed aloud and then stepped into the Great Saint's secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng looked at Gu Yang and Gu Xiu beside him and said, "This Great Saint's secret realm only allows Daogong Realm cultivators to enter, which is also an opportunity. You two can consider whether to enter."</p><p></p><p>"If you enter, I will provide you with protective measures."</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Gu Qingfeng himself was somewhat tempted by the inheritance left behind by a top-tier Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not want to directly confront the prohibitive power left behind by the Great Saint of the Tienfeng. </p><p></p><p>From the scene of the Daogong Realm expert being crushed just now, it was clear that the prohibitive power left behind by the Great Saint of the Tienfeng was extremely powerful. Even a true Saint might not be able to forcefully break through it.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Qingfeng naturally would not take the risk.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang pondered for a moment, then said, "I plan to enter the Great Saint's secret realm!"</p><p></p><p>The reason he made this decision was that Gu Yang had his own considerations.</p><p></p><p>The existence of the Nine States was no longer a secret, and after today, the Divine Martial Empire was destined to come into the sight of the Five Domains of the Desolate Ancient Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although the Nine States had the Ancient Beast Mountain Range as a barrier, it could not stop the powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>Just look at how the Guiyuan Empire's million-strong army had broken through the entire Ancient Beast Mountain Range, the danger was there, but it was nothing in the eyes of the top experts.</p><p></p><p>After witnessing the power of the external experts, Gu Yang was eager to improve his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>At the initial Grand Ancestor Realm, excluding the Gu Family Manor, this level of cultivation was already considered top-tier in the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>But for the entire Desolate Ancient Realm, the Grand Ancestor Realm was completely inadequate.</p><p></p><p>After all, even the weakest among the ten million Divine Emperor Army were Grand Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>"Take out the item I gave you before," Gu Qingfeng said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang naturally knew what he was referring to, and immediately took out the jade box.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng opened the jade box, and inside was his own severed finger, but the power within it had weakened considerably.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Gu Qingfeng squeezed out a drop of his spiritual blood and infused it into the severed finger. In an instant, the finger became plump and full of vitality, and a terrifying aura began to emanate from it.</p><p></p><p>"With a drop of my spiritual blood infused into it, below the Daogong Realm, as long as they don't have a supreme treasure to protect themselves, I believe it can slay them all. Take it with you, and if things become impossible... well, you know better than I do how to make that choice."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng originally wanted to give Gu Yang a few more words of caution, but suddenly realized that his eldest son had already become a monarch, and perhaps there was nothing worth cautioning him about.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Gu Xuan hesitated for a moment, then also cupped his hands and said, "I would also like to try entering..."</p><p></p><p>When he said these words, Gu Xuan actually didn't have much confidence.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was only at the middle Xiwu Realm, and hadn't even fully cultivated the Wudu Realm. Compared to these experts who were casually Grand Ancestors or Shenbian Realm, he was no different from an ant.</p><p></p><p>However, the opportunity of the Great Saint was right in front of him, and if he didn't enter, he would be filled with regret.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Gu Xuan finished speaking, Gu Qingfeng suddenly stretched out his hand, and a beam of light instantly shot out from the manor, arriving in his hand in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"Take the Zhu Xie Sword with you into the secret realm, if you encounter danger, this sword can protect you."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng handed the Zhu Xie Sword to Gu Xuan, who was overjoyed upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan understood the power of the Zhu Xie Sword. More importantly, by staying with Fu He, Gu Xuan had learned about some cultivation-related issues. The aura that long-term cultivators could contain around themselves was extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Since his father's strength was on par with the top Daogong Realm experts, the divine sword he had been refining day and night was certainly no ordinary weapon.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the two of them entered the Great Saint's secret realm.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Gu Qingfeng also ordered Gu Wu and the others to enter the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>This time, Gu Yang only brought Gu Wu and Gu Dao, while the other two remained to guard the capital, in case of any other unexpected events.</p><p></p><p>As for the other people of the Divine Martial Empire, such as Shi Zhen and the Tiangao Army under his command, they had no intention of entering the Great Saint's secret realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, Shi Zhen was clear about his own situation.</p><p></p><p>Although Shi Zhen had succeeded in reaching the peak of the Grand Ancestor Realm by taking medicinal pills, among the experts entering the Great Saint's secret realm, the Grand Ancestor Realm was nothing more than an ant.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he did not have the protective treasure that Gu Qingfeng had given to Gu Yang and the others. If he rashly entered, he might not even have a chance to walk out alive.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"You all lead three hundred thousand troops to enter!" </p><p></p><p>On the other side, Ji Meng looked at the several Shenbian Realm peak deputy generals beside him and said.</p><p></p><p>With the Great Saint's secret realm opening, the Guiyuan Empire naturally could not miss this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>However, since there was the prohibition left behind by the Great Saint of the Tienfeng, Ji Meng naturally could not enter himself, so he could only send the Divine Emperor Army to enter and seek opportunities.</p><p></p><p>But to prevent all the Divine Emperor Army from entering and causing problems on his side, Ji Meng only allowed three hundred thousand Divine Emperor Army to enter, while the remaining seven hundred thousand remained on standby.</p><p></p><p>In this way, even if there were top Daogong Realm experts taking action, with these seven hundred thousand troops, Ji Meng would still have the ability to fight.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had brought a semi-Saint artifact from the Guiyuan Empire on this trip. If he really exerted his full strength, he would even have the chance to slay the peak Daogong Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Ji Meng looked towards the direction of the Divine Martial Empire, and just happened to make eye contact with Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the latter's indifferent expression...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this, Jie Meng's gaze turned cold again.</p><p></p><p>This was not the time to erupt into conflict. After the affairs of the Great Saint's Secret Realm are concluded, there will still be time to settle accounts with the other party.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has entered the Great Saint's Secret Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has entered the Great Saint's Secret Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by ferocious beasts *136!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain a神変 (Divine Transformation) Realm third-grade ferocious beast!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain a神変 Realm eighth-grade ferocious beast!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain a神変 Realm second-grade ferocious beast!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has obtained heavenly materials and earthly treasures, slightly improving his aptitude after consuming them!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has been attacked by ferocious beasts *356!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has slain a神変 Realm sixth-grade ferocious beast!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has been attacked by a神変 Realm eighth-grade cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has slain a神変 Realm eighth-grade cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has consumed a mysterious medicinal pill, breaking through to the post-Xiwu (Cleanse Marrow) Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +50 Improvement Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As other cultivators gradually entered the Great Saint's Secret Realm, Gu Qingfeng also skillfully opened the information panel, looking at the text on it.</p><p></p><p>The moment the two entered, the information panel was instantly flooded with numerous updates, causing a slight change in Gu Qingfeng's expression.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, there were many ferocious beasts in the Great Saint's Secret Realm, otherwise Gu Yang and Gu Xuan would not have encountered so many attacks immediately after entering.</p><p></p><p>However, seeing that the two had slain神変 Realm ferocious beasts, Gu Qingfeng felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>With the methods he had left behind to protect them, they should not face any major problems.</p><p></p><p>Of course, every secret realm has its dangers.</p><p></p><p>How it will turn out depends on their individual fortunes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Gu Xuan had broken through to the post-Xiwu Realm so quickly, Gu Qingfeng was also somewhat satisfied.</p><p></p><p>The secret realm is full of dangers, but there are also many opportunities.</p><p></p><p>From now on, let's see how far the two of them can go.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the Great Saint's Secret Realm, Gu Xuan sat cross-legged, his aura surging and boiling. Around him, many ferocious beasts and cultivators' corpses had fallen, their wounds clean and precise, as if they had been sliced in half by a sharp divine blade. The lingering murderous intent remained on them.</p><p></p><p>The Zhu Xie Dao (Eradicating Evil Sword) stood upright beside him, emanating endless sword qi, as if guarding him.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Gu Xuan opened his eyes and let out a long breath.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I've finally reached the post-Xiwu Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he looked at the many corpses on the ground, his expression not changing much.</p><p></p><p>Death is just death. Gu Xuan had seen it many times before. In the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, he couldn't even remember how many ferocious beasts he had slain, and before entering the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, Gu Xuan's hands were already stained with blood.</p><p></p><p>So when it comes to killing, Gu Xuan doesn't have much psychological burden.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these cultivators he had slain were coveting the power of the Zhu Xie Dao and trying to seize the precious treasure, only to be directly counterattacked and killed by the sword.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered the Great Saint's Secret Realm, Gu Xuan found that he and Gu Yang had been completely separated. Before he could even get a clear understanding of the situation around him, many ferocious beasts had attacked.</p><p></p><p>Reluctantly, Gu Xuan could only use the power of the Zhu Xie Dao. This divine sword did not disappoint him. Even powerful神変 Realm ferocious beasts were unable to withstand the sharpness of the divine sword and were directly slain on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>However, this also attracted the attention of some cultivators who had also entered the secret realm, who coveted this precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>The rest, of course, does not need to be said.</p><p></p><p>After counterattacking and killing these cultivators, Gu Xuan habitually searched their bodies, rummaging through their storage bags and finding many things, including a medicinal pill that could help him cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Having been by Fu He's side for a long time, Gu Xuan was clear about these medicinal pills. Of course, if it was a medicinal pill he didn't understand, he wouldn't rashly consume it.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Xuan looked around the situation and immediately took out the remaining medicinal pills to start breaking through.</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint's Secret Realm is dangerous. His current Xiwu Realm cultivation is not enough.</p><p></p><p>With so many ferocious beasts and cultivators falling here, although the bloody aura may attract even more powerful ferocious beasts, the remaining aura can also intimidate ordinary beasts.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Xuan must seize this opportunity to break through.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has consumed a mysterious medicinal pill, breaking through to the Xiwu Realm Perfection!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +50 Improvement Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has consumed a mysterious medicinal pill, breaking through to the first layer of the Lian Zang (Refine Viscera) Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +80 Improvement Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has consumed a mysterious medicinal pill, breaking through to the second layer of the Lian Zang Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +80 Improvement Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has consumed a mysterious medicinal pill, breaking through to the third layer of the Lian Zang Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +80 Improvement Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has consumed a mysterious medicinal pill, breaking through to the fourth layer of the Lian Zang Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +80 Improvement Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has consumed a mysterious medicinal pill, breaking through to the fifth layer of the Lian Zang Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +80 Improvement Points!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In a short period of time, Gu Qingfeng watched as Gu Xuan's cultivation rapidly soared, breaking through from the post-Xiwu Realm to the fifth layer of the Lian Zang Realm, causing his expression to change slightly.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that Gu Xuan, shortly after entering the Great Saint's Secret Realm, would break through so much.</p><p></p><p>Adding up the previous breakthrough, Gu Xuan had provided a total of 500 Improvement Points.</p><p></p><p>The breakthrough of the five Lian Zang Realms alone had provided 400 Improvement Points, not to mention the previous ones.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Gu Qingfeng also took a look at his own attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng  Age: 52/6000  Realm: Dao Palace Realm Fourth Layer</p><p>Martial Arts: Heavenly Vein True Classic (Second Layer), Heavenly Sword (Perfection), Great Wasteland Fist Classic (Perfection), Divine Yang Classic (Dao Palace Realm Fourth Layer), Archaic Heavenly Sword (Beginner), Purple Extreme Dao Classic (Perfection), Departing Wind True Classic (Not Learned)</p><p>Improvement Points: 1264</p><p></p><p>"The Improvement Points have already exceeded 1,200. If I continue to accumulate them, I can make a breakthrough in the Archaic Heavenly Sword.</p><p></p><p>Once the Archaic Heavenly Sword breaks through, even if my cultivation remains at the Dao Palace Realm Fourth Layer, my strength can undergo a qualitative transformation!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered.</p><p></p><p>The profound arts of the Saints are powerful. Once a breakthrough is made, the benefits are obvious.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Gu Qingfeng looked towards the entrance of the secret realm again.</p><p></p><p>If the Saint's inheritance is already so powerful, what would the Great Saint's inheritance be like?

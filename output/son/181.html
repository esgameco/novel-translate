        <h1>Chapter 181</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Yiyou spoke again.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression remained calm: "The Taixuan Dynasty is setting in the west, and those immortal sects and aristocratic families will not allow it to truly continue.</p><p></p><p>Whoever helps the Taixuan Dynasty prolong its life will become the enemy of the immortal sects and aristocratic families of the world.</p><p></p><p>Being the case, why should the Gu family manor get involved?"</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng was not afraid of the immortal sects and aristocratic families, the words he had released in the capital of Guangyang Prefecture had thoroughly offended all the practitioners in the world.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>Being offended is one thing.</p><p></p><p>Now getting involved in the situation in the Central Plains is also unnecessary.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng disliked the aristocratic sects, and he also disliked the Taixuan Dynasty equally.</p><p></p><p>Let them fight, he will let them fight.</p><p></p><p>As for whether the Taixuan Dynasty will be angered by this, Gu Qingfeng also does not consider it important.</p><p></p><p>After all, they are already struggling to take care of themselves in the Central Plains, let alone reaching out to Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Taking a step back.</p><p></p><p>If anyone dares to reach out to Guangyang Prefecture now, Gu Qingfeng will cut them down.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the Brocade Guard has received news that Eunuch Zhao was ambushed and killed on his way back to the Central Plains, and his whereabouts are now unknown!"</p><p></p><p>In the imperial study of the Central Plains, the commander of the Brocade Guard spoke in a heavy voice.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Ji Chunqiu was furiously enraged.</p><p></p><p>"Daring to ambush and kill the court's people, they really have a death wish!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Hai being assassinated.</p><p></p><p>This truly infuriated Ji Chunqiu.</p><p></p><p>After all, Zhao Hai had been by his side for many years, and the imperial court had paid a considerable price to cultivate him to the realm of a true Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Hai has been assassinated, no matter from which perspective, it is a slap in the face of the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>As for the "unknown whereabouts", Ji Chunqiu was well aware of the true situation.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently.</p><p></p><p>Ji Chunqiu suppressed the anger in his heart, looked at the Brocade Guard commander in front of him, and asked, "What's the situation in Qingyun State?"</p><p></p><p>"No movement."</p><p></p><p>The other party shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Ji Chunqiu's eyes turned cold again.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the tiger has fallen in the plains, they really think the Taixuan Dynasty's days are numbered!"</p><p></p><p>Enfeoffing the rebel as the King of Guangyang and bestowing the honored position of National Teacher Martial Saint, Ji Chunqiu felt that he had shown great respect for the other party.</p><p></p><p>But now it seems, the Guangyang King did not appreciate the gesture.</p><p></p><p>This matter.</p><p></p><p>Ji Chunqiu made a mental note of it.</p><p></p><p>Since Qingyun State wants to sit back and watch the tigers fight, then after the problems in the Central Plains are resolved, he will slowly settle the account with them.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Dao Saint!"</p><p></p><p>"Above the Grand Masters-"</p><p></p><p>"If such powerful experts can be used by the court, it would be the best, if not, then there is no need for their existence!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Chunqiu's thought concluded, he waved his hand to dismiss the person in front of him, then left the imperial study and headed towards the imperial forbidden grounds.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>The situation in the Central Plains was changing unpredictably.</p><p></p><p>The Qingyun State side was also in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was secluded in the Whetstone Hall of the Gu family manor, continuing to delve into and explore the profound mysteries of the Longevity Sutra, while cultivating the Pure Yang True Body, as well as comprehending the true essence of the two Grand Master's supreme techniques - the Tyrannical Saber Slash and the Sun and Moon Fist Classics.</p><p></p><p>The first two naturally need no further elaboration.</p><p></p><p>As for the latter two.</p><p></p><p>The true essence of the two Grand Master's techniques, both were at the ninth-level true essence realm, the peak of the Grand Master realm.</p><p></p><p>Going further.</p><p></p><p>Would be the Grand Master true essence.</p><p></p><p>Grand Masters are extremely rare in the world.</p><p></p><p>Even for ordinary Grand Masters, those who can truly break through are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, let alone true essence Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a year had passed.</p><p></p><p>During this half-year period, Gu Qingfeng successfully created the Xisui chapter of the Longevity Sutra, but his Chun Yang True Body remained at the introductory stage, unable to make further progress.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, he also understood that even with his Extreme Dao Sect Master's cultivation, cultivating the Sect Master's techniques was still not that easy. If one did not have the Extreme Dao Sect Master's realm, it would be even more difficult to make any advancement.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, Gu Qingfeng had quite a good grasp of the Hegemon Saber Slash and the Sun and Moon Fist Classic.</p><p></p><p>He had a premonition that if he could truly grasp this understanding and then fuse the two martial arts together, he might be able to create a supreme and unparalleled skill that could break through the Sect Master's bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>Such an unparalleled skill would allow him to step into the realm of the Great Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>During this half-year period, there were also some changes in the information panel.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, Gu Yang's half-year of recuperation had given him the urge to gradually expand his influence outward.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu had both made breakthroughs, successfully refining their Blood Refinement to the intermediate stage.</p><p></p><p>Gu Shengnan, with her innate Sect Master's physique, had also been passively promoted to the intermediate stage of Skin Refinement.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, Gu Qingfeng suspected that perhaps when Gu Shengnan truly engaged in the martial dao, she would be able to step into the Blood Refinement realm.</p><p></p><p>The breakthroughs of the younger generation had brought Gu Qingfeng forty-two upgrade points.</p><p></p><p>The only regret was that Gu Yang's cultivation had temporarily stagnated at the post-Bone Refinement stage, unable to make further progress.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng was at peace with this situation, as breaking through the Bone Refinement realm was not an easy task. Strictly speaking, Gu Yang had only just broken through the intermediate Bone Refinement stage a little over half a year ago, so it was impossible for him to make another breakthrough within half a year.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Divine Martial Sect had secret pills that could help people break through, there were still limitations to their use. They could not be consumed endlessly, as that would damage one's foundation.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the pills rewarded by the information panel did not have this problem.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Qingfeng had instructed his people to send many of the unused pills, such as Blood Refinement Pills and Bone Refinement Pills, to Gu Yang and the others to aid their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"It's about time!" Gu Yang's eyes were cold and sharp as he stood before the various generals of the current Guangyang Army.</p><p></p><p>Since he had established himself as the king, the imperial court had also conferred the title of the King of Guangyang upon him, so the Gu Family Army had been renamed the Guangyang Army.</p><p></p><p>After half a year of recuperation, and with the support of the Taishan Prefecture, Gu Yang now commanded a formidable army of 1.3 million soldiers. Moreover, half of these were veteran soldiers, while the other half, though new recruits, had undergone rigorous training and were not weak in combat power.</p><p></p><p>"The intelligence from the secret guards indicates that the various rebel kings have formed an alliance and are jointly besieging the imperial court. The Taixuan Dynasty is on the verge of collapse," Gu Yang said calmly but with an undeniable aura of dominance.</p><p></p><p>"And with Fei Jing's demise, the various prefectures of Qingyun State are in chaos, unable to form a unified force."</p><p></p><p>"This," Gu Yang continued as he stepped up to the map table and firmly planted the Guangyang Army's flag on the Nanyang Prefecture, "is the opportunity for my Guangyang Army!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 104</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has learned the Gu family's martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has learned the Gu family's martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has made some progress in cultivating the Gu family's martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has made some progress in cultivating the Gu family's martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring..."</p><p></p><p>Over the next period of time, Gu Qingfeng kept a close eye on the information panel.</p><p></p><p>Every few days, he would see the information panel refresh.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how long it will take for Xuan and Xiu to reach the martial dao realm!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng mused.</p><p></p><p>The two had been immersed in medicinal baths and tempering their roots since childhood. Even if their innate talents were average when they were just born, after so many years of tempering, they could now be considered geniuses.</p><p></p><p>The previous Gu Yang had only taken about three months to reach the initial stage of skin refinement.</p><p></p><p>This level of talent could already be considered a top-tier genius.</p><p></p><p>But the difference was that Gu Yang had not enjoyed the same medicinal bath and root tempering treatment as the two. If he had received the same treatment, he could have become an apex genius without any problems.</p><p></p><p>However, root and innate qualities are not absolute.</p><p></p><p>It's just that those with good root and innate qualities can cultivate with divine assistance, while those with average qualities will have a more difficult time cultivating.</p><p></p><p>But the ultimate limit still depends on the individual.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later, the information panel refreshed again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has broken through to the initial stage of skin refinement!"</p><p>"Reward: 1 Upgrade Point!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has broken through to the initial stage of skin refinement!"</p><p>"Reward: 1 Upgrade Point!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"As expected!" </p><p></p><p>A smile finally appeared on Gu Qingfeng's face, and the heavy stone that had been hanging in his heart finally fell.</p><p></p><p>The breakthroughs of Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu could bring him upgrade points, which meant that his previous ideas were not wrong.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, Gu Qingfeng had finally confirmed one thing.</p><p></p><p>As long as a person can be recorded in the information panel, their breakthroughs will bring him upgrade points.</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as Gu family's bloodline descendants are numerous enough in the future, Gu Qingfeng can obtain a massive amount of upgrade points.</p><p></p><p>At that time, no matter what kind of master or grand master, they would be easily crushed.</p><p>Even the evil Buddha of the Nine Turns Path could be suppressed with a single hand.</p><p></p><p>However, these are all future matters.</p><p></p><p>Before that, he must ensure that the number of Gu family's bloodline descendants increases.</p><p></p><p>Now, Gu Qingfeng even regretted that he did not make more efforts when his cultivation was low. If he had sired ten or eight offspring, he could have directly taken off.</p><p></p><p>But there is no regret medicine in the world, and the current situation is not bad either.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang has already established a family and had offspring, and in a few more years, Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu can also start their own families.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the Gu family's bloodline will flourish.</p><p></p><p>The only problem is probably just a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Gu Qingfeng looked at the information panel again.</p><p></p><p>Now, the two had only taken half a month to reach the martial dao realm, their talents could be considered top-tier geniuses, no, to be precise, they were truly outstanding even among top-tier geniuses.</p><p></p><p>In other other sects and families, they would have the qualifications to impact the realm of masters.</p><p></p><p>"Such talents are not in vain after all these years of medicinal baths and root tempering. However, Yang's case could be considered a coincidence, but for Xiu and Xuan to also have such talents, it is likely related to the cultivation realm of the martial artists."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng mused.</p><p></p><p>The higher the cultivation realm of the martial artists, the higher the innate talents of their offspring.</p><p></p><p>Although this probability is not 100%, it is still much higher than ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, while the innate talents of the offspring are higher, the probability of conceiving offspring is also correspondingly reduced.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Overall, it's a mixed bag - some gains, some losses.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng would occasionally guide Gu Xuan, and the two of them indeed had astonishing natural talents. </p><p></p><p>After entering the initial stage of Refining Skin, they only took a month to break through to the intermediate stage of Refining Skin.</p><p></p><p>When the two of them broke through the intermediate stage of Refining Skin, Gu Qingfeng once again obtained 4 points of advancement.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, whether it was the previous breakthrough or this one, the real rewards were just the advancement points, without any additional benefits.</p><p></p><p>This shows that as the first offspring to emerge, Gu Yang naturally had an advantage. The subsequent offspring, although they could also provide advancement points for themselves, the rewards would be much less.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Gu Qingfeng was already satisfied that he could get the advancement points, as those were the main thing.</p><p></p><p>The rest were negligible.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has gained some insights in cultivating the Gu Family Fist and broken through the post-Refining Skin realm!"</p><p>"Reward: 5 advancement points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has gained some understanding in cultivating the Gu Family Fist, and his strength has increased slightly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain a Refining Blood intermediate realm warrior!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by a Refining Bone intermediate realm warrior!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked 5 times by a Refining Blood perfected realm warrior!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' -"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng, who was originally calmly cultivating in the Whetstone Hall, saw the flood of information on the panel, and his expression suddenly turned furious. A surging aura of sword intent burst forth from the Whetstone Hall, causing the many divine weapons to hum silently.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Gu Qingfeng walked out of the Whetstone Hall.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, Gu Peng arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, where is the young master now?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was cold.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the suppressed anger emanating from Gu Qingfeng, Gu Peng was puzzled but did not dare hesitate for a moment, hurriedly bowing and saying, "Reporting to the lord, news came yesterday that there were rebel troops roaming in the White Stone Sect, so the young master led the outer disciples to deal with the rebel troops."</p><p></p><p>"Rebel troops?" Gu Qingfeng's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng said, "In recent years, the Divine Martial King has conquered several prefectures, and the court has suffered heavy losses. Even in Guangyang Prefecture, there are many rebel troops roaming around, and some defeated soldiers have even turned to banditry.</p><p></p><p>Although we of the White Stone Sect have also been affected, these matters have not disturbed the lord, and the young master has been handling them all alone!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Qingfeng's expression remained cold, but he understood the situation.</p><p></p><p>In the past two years, the Divine Martial King's power had grown increasingly stronger. Even a year ago, that Divine Martial King had already knocked on the doors of the Flowing Cloud Prefecture, with the main army marching straight in, and the war had officially spilled over to the Taishan Prefecture. As Guangyang Prefecture was a subordinate of Taishan Prefecture, it was naturally unavoidable.</p><p></p><p>The rebel troops and defeated soldiers turning to banditry were indeed a normal occurrence.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Gu Qingfeng asked, "I ask you, where exactly is Yang'er?"</p><p></p><p>"Red Rock Village!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The setting sun was like blood.</p><p></p><p>Cries of slaughter rang out in a certain village, and the previous tranquility had long since vanished.</p><p></p><p>As far as the eye could see, there were the bodies of commoners, both men and women, old and young. Some of the corpses were even indecently exposed, indicating that they had been subjected to various forms of humiliation before their deaths.</p><p></p><p>But if one looked closely, one would find that most of the people had been disemboweled, with all their internal organs removed.</p><p></p><p>In the village, over a hundred rebel troops were engaged in a fierce battle with the people of the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

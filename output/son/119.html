        <h1>Chapter 119</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The entire Shenquan Sect was turned upside down.</p><p></p><p>Many ancient artifacts, paintings, and divine weapons were all taken away by Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Combining this with some silver, Gu Qingfeng estimated that he had looted at least five million taels of silver from the Shenquan Sect.</p><p></p><p>It's hard to imagine.</p><p></p><p>That a single sect could have things worth five million taels of silver.</p><p></p><p>And that's not even counting the martial arts.</p><p></p><p>If the martial arts were included, the value of the Shenquan Sect would be over ten million taels.</p><p></p><p>After all, a single supreme martial arts manual like the Prajnaparamita Sutra was priceless.</p><p></p><p>However, these things were not what Gu Qingfeng was most concerned about.</p><p></p><p>What he cared about the most was a volume of a master's manuscript.</p><p></p><p>"The Sutra of the Sun and Moon Fist!"</p><p></p><p>This was a manual of a master's fist technique left behind by the powerful experts of the Shenquan Sect.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, the power of the master's true intent was contained between the lines of this fist manual.</p><p></p><p>This master's true intent was not unfamiliar to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Sutra of the Sun and Moon Fist had been passed down for too long, and had been comprehended by the successive powerful experts of the Shenquan Sect, so the power of the master's true intent had weakened to a certain extent, as if it could dissipate at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng suspected that this was precisely why the later generations of the Shenquan Sect did not continue to comprehend the Sutra of the Sun and Moon Fist, but instead preserved this manual, waiting for a truly talented and insightful disciple to comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, once the master's true intent within was exhausted, the value of this master's manual would be greatly discounted.</p><p></p><p>Compared to other manuals that only recorded the sect's martial arts, the one containing the master's true intent was far more valuable.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The team on the way here was not large, but on the way back, there were more than ten additional carriages, all filled with the treasures of the Shenquan Sect.</p><p></p><p>Such a large team traveling from Liuyun Prefecture to Guangyang Prefecture would inevitably attract attention.</p><p></p><p>In these troubled times, once you draw attention, it means endless trouble.</p><p></p><p>However, there was not a single person in Gu Family Village's team who looked worried.</p><p></p><p>It was simple.</p><p></p><p>Not only was there Gu Peng, the outer hall master who could kill the Shenquan Sect's deputy sect master with a single punch, but there was also the tyrannical Gu Qingfeng, who could slay a master with a single sword strike, leading the team.</p><p></p><p>Such formidable power, no matter where they went, would be utterly terrifying. What did they have to fear from a few bandits?</p><p></p><p>So, any obstructers were basically resolved thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Gu Qingfeng even had Gu Peng track down the lairs of these attacking bandits, and then directly wipe them out.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the bandit troubles along the route from Liuyun Prefecture to Guangyang Prefecture were suddenly greatly reduced, with most of the bandits being directly eliminated by Gu Peng's team.</p><p></p><p>A Xingzao Fifth Realm expert was a true top-tier existence in a prefecture, how could ordinary bandits be their match?</p><p></p><p>To be honest, anyone with some real strength would not become a bandit.</p><p></p><p>So, Gu Peng went on a rampage.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the cargo being transported by the Gu Family Village team kept increasing.</p><p></p><p>From the original dozen or so carriages, it had now grown to almost thirty carriages, with the additional items naturally being looted from the various bandit lairs.</p><p></p><p>As the team grew larger, the number of people daring to attack them became fewer and fewer.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the Green Forest jianghu, news had spread that this time it was Gu Qingfeng, the old patriarch of the Gu Family Manor, who was personally leading the expedition. He was widely recognized as a half-step Sect Master-level expert, and anyone who dared to make a move against him would be courting death.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, news also spread from the Liuyun Manor that the thousand-year-old Sect, the Divine Fist Sect, had been destroyed, and the force suspected of carrying out the attack was the Gu Family Manor. It was even said that an Elder from the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect had perished in the process.</p><p></p><p>This news caused a great stir in all directions.</p><p></p><p>A bandit chief from a mountain stronghold, upon hearing this news, sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>"The Gu Family Manor is truly a fierce dragon crossing the river. That Saber Monarch's actions are indeed extremely overbearing, actually leading his men across several prefectures to destroy the Divine Fist Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Fist Sect has stood for a thousand years, with unfathomable foundations. It is said that even the Sect Master from hundreds of years ago had not truly died."</p><p></p><p>"Now that the Divine Fist Sect has been destroyed, I've heard that a Heavenly Yang Sword Sect Elder of the Innate Realm also fell at the hands of Gu Qingfeng. This person is not to be trifled with."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he ordered all the bandits in the stronghold not to make any moves against the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether the rumors were true that the Saber Monarch had killed a Heavenly Yang Sword Sect Elder, and whether that would offend the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect, at the very least, that person was beyond their ability to handle.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect were to later destroy the Gu Family Manor, it would be because of the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect's overwhelming strength, not because the Gu Family Manor was weak.</p><p></p><p>After all, the fact that the Divine Fist Sect had been destroyed was already a testament to the Gu Family Manor's strength.</p><p></p><p>If the rumors were true, the Saber Monarch, even if he had not broken through to the Sect Master realm, his personal strength would still surpass that of a Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>A Sect Master expert! Not only in a single prefecture, but even in an entire commandery or province, he would be a true top-tier powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, all the Green Forest bandits fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Even if Gu Qingfeng had previously ordered the destruction of their mountain strongholds, blatantly slapping them in the face, they dared not utter a single word.</p><p></p><p>Joke's on them.</p><p></p><p>Who would dare to be reckless against someone suspected to be at the Sect Master level?</p><p></p><p>Not to mention a Sect Master, even Gu Peng, who had reached the pinnacle of the Corrupted Realm, was not someone they could handle.</p><p></p><p>While the Green Forest bandits were all cowed into submission, among the common folk, the reputation of the Gu Family Manor also spread.</p><p></p><p>This was because Gu Qingfeng had ordered the destruction of the mountain strongholds and the elimination of the bandits and outlaws, which had saved many civilians from their harassment, and even directly rescued some.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the Gu Family Manor had gained a lot of positive reputation among the common people.</p><p></p><p>As for Gu Qingfeng, he paid little attention to this.</p><p></p><p>His full focus was now on the Sect Master's manual.</p><p></p><p>The stone from another mountain can be used to polish the jade.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng's main focus was on the Saber Technique, it did not mean he was not passionate about the fist techniques.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, Gu Qingfeng was extremely interested in all kinds of martial arts, especially the profound ones, which could truly captivate his heart.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, the mysteries of the Sun and Moon Fist Classic were truly fascinating him.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Sect Master's true essence contained within, which allowed him to gain unique insights.</p><p></p><p>As both the Saber Monarch Slash and the Sun and Moon Fist Classic were Sect Master-level martial arts, they could be used to mutually verify and enlighten each other.</p><p></p><p>Although one was a saber technique and the other a fist technique, the principle of "the stone from another mountain can be used to polish the jade" applied, and the mutual verification would bring immense benefits.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, Gu Qingfeng's understanding of the Saber Monarch Slash was deepening, and he was also beginning to glimpse the profound mysteries of the Sun and Moon Fist Classic.</p><p></p><p>However, to truly master them would still require some time.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

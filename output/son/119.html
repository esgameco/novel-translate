        <h1>Chapter 119</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The entire Shenquan Sect was turned upside down.</p><p></p><p>Many ancient artifacts, paintings, and divine weapons were all taken away by Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Combining this with some silver, Gu Qingfeng estimated that he had looted at least five million taels of silver from the Shenquan Sect.</p><p></p><p>It's hard to imagine that a single sect could have possessions worth five million taels of silver.</p><p></p><p>And this is without even accounting for the martial arts.</p><p></p><p>If the martial arts were included, the value of the Shenquan Sect would be over ten million taels.</p><p></p><p>After all, a single supreme martial arts manual like the Prajnaparamita Sutra was priceless.</p><p></p><p>However, these things were not what Gu Qingfeng was most concerned about.</p><p></p><p>What he cared about the most was a manual written by a master.</p><p></p><p>"The Daynight Fist Classic!"</p><p></p><p>This was a manual left behind by a powerful expert of the Shenquan Sect, recording a supreme martial art.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, the manual was imbued with the true essence of the master's martial arts.</p><p></p><p>This master's true essence was not unfamiliar to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Daynight Fist Classic had been passed down for too long and had been contemplated by generations of Shenquan Sect experts, so the power of the true essence had weakened to the point of dissipation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng suspected that this was why later generations of the Shenquan Sect did not continue to study the Daynight Fist Classic, but instead preserved the manual, waiting for a truly talented and insightful disciple to comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, once the master's true essence was exhausted, the value of the manual would be greatly diminished.</p><p></p><p>Compared to other manuals that only recorded the sect's martial arts, the one containing the master's true essence was far more valuable.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The group that came was not large, but on the way back, there were over ten more carriages, all filled with the treasures of the Shenquan Sect.</p><p></p><p>Such a large convoy traveling from Liuyun Prefecture to Guangyang Prefecture would inevitably attract attention.</p><p></p><p>In these troubled times, drawing attention meant inviting endless trouble.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no one in Gu Family Village's convoy who seemed worried.</p><p></p><p>This was because they had Gu Peng, the outer hall master who could kill the Shenquan Sect's vice-sect master with a single punch, as well as the Overlord Blade Gu Qingfeng, who could slay a master with a single stroke.</p><p></p><p>With such formidable power, they had no fear of a few bandits or outlaws.</p><p></p><p>Whenever there were any obstructions, they were swiftly and thoroughly eliminated.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Gu Qingfeng had Gu Peng track down the lairs of these bandits and wipe them out completely.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the bandit threats along the route from Liuyun Prefecture to Guangyang Prefecture were drastically reduced, with most of the bandits being eliminated by Gu Peng's forces.</p><p></p><p>A Xiantian Realm expert was a true top-tier powerhouse in a prefecture, easily capable of dealing with mere bandits.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, anyone with real strength would not resort to becoming a bandit.</p><p></p><p>So Gu Peng went on a rampage, and the convoy's cargo kept increasing.</p><p></p><p>From the original dozen or so carriages, it had grown to nearly thirty, filled with the spoils taken from the bandit lairs.</p><p></p><p>As the convoy grew larger, those daring enough to attack it became fewer and fewer.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the Green Forest jianghu, news had spread that this time it was Gu Qingfeng, the old patriarch of the Gu Family Manor, who was personally leading the expedition. He was widely recognized as a half-step Sect Master-level expert, and anyone who dared to make a move against him would be courting certain death.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, news also spread from the Liuyun Manor that the thousand-year-old Sect, the Divine Fist Sect, had been destroyed, and the force suspected of carrying out the attack was the Gu Family Manor, with even an Elder of the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect having perished.</p><p></p><p>This news caused a great stir across the land.</p><p></p><p>A bandit chief from a mountain stronghold, upon hearing this news, sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>"The Gu Family Manor is truly a fierce dragon crossing the river. That Saber Overlord's actions are indeed extremely overbearing, actually leading his men across several prefectures to destroy the Divine Fist Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Fist Sect has stood for a thousand years, with unfathomable foundations. It is said that even the Sect Master from centuries ago had not truly died."</p><p></p><p>"Now that the Divine Fist Sect has been destroyed, I've heard that an Innate Elder of the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect also fell at the hands of Gu Qingfeng. This person is not to be trifled with."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he ordered all the bandits in the stronghold not to make any moves against the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether the rumors were true that the Saber Overlord had killed a Heavenly Yang Sword Sect Elder, which might have offended the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect, at the very least, that person was beyond their ability to handle.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect were to later destroy the Gu Family Manor, it would be because of the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect's overwhelming strength, not because the Gu Family Manor was weak.</p><p></p><p>After all, the fact that the Divine Fist Sect had been destroyed was already a testament to the Gu Family Manor's strength.</p><p></p><p>If the rumors were true, then even if the Saber Overlord had not broken through to the Sect Master realm, his personal strength would still surpass that of a Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>A Sect Master expert! Not only in a single prefecture, but even in an entire commandery or province, they would be true top-tier powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, all the Green Forest bandits fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Even though Gu Qingfeng had previously ordered the destruction of mountain strongholds, which was seen as a slap in the face to the Green Forest, they dared not utter a word.</p><p></p><p>Joke's on them.</p><p></p><p>Who would dare to act recklessly against someone suspected to be at the Sect Master level?</p><p></p><p>Not to mention a Sect Master, even Gu Peng, who had reached the pinnacle of the Impure Realm, was not someone they could handle.</p><p></p><p>While the Green Forest bandits were all cowed into submission, among the common folk, the reputation of the Gu Family Manor also spread.</p><p></p><p>This was due to Gu Qingfeng's order to destroy the mountain strongholds and eliminate the bandits and outlaws, which had saved many civilians from the scourge of the bandits, and some had even been indirectly rescued by the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the Gu Family Manor had gained a lot of positive reputation among the common people.</p><p></p><p>As for Gu Qingfeng, he paid little attention to this.</p><p></p><p>His full focus was now on the Sect Master's manual.</p><p></p><p>The stone from another mountain can be used to polish the jade.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng's main focus was on the Saber Dao, he was by no means uninterested in the martial arts of the fist.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, Gu Qingfeng was extremely passionate about all martial arts, especially the profound and esoteric ones, which could deeply captivate his heart.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, the mysteries of the Divine Sun Fist Classic were truly fascinating him.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Sect Master's true essence contained within, which allowed him to gain unique insights.</p><p></p><p>As both the Saber Overlord Slash and the Divine Sun Fist Classic were Sect Master-level martial arts, they could be used to mutually verify and enlighten each other.</p><p></p><p>Although one was a saber technique and the other a fist technique, the principle of "the stone from another mountain can be used to polish the jade" applied, and the mutual verification would bring immense benefits.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, Gu Qingfeng's understanding of the Saber Overlord Slash was deepening, while he was also beginning to glimpse the profound mysteries of the Divine Sun Fist Classic.</p><p></p><p>However, to truly master them would still require some time.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

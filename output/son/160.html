        <h1>Chapter 160</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The ancient words caused Gu Yang's expression to change.</p><p></p><p>Even Gu Qingfeng's face couldn't help but move slightly.</p><p></p><p>"According to the words of the former Sect Master, the Martial Ancestor of the Divine Martial Sect was a powerful figure even beyond the Great Grandmasters?"</p><p></p><p>Now, </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was a bit more polite towards Gu Yun, not as coldly indifferent as before.</p><p></p><p>After all, from the current situation, Gu Yun did not seem to have much malice.</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was quite curious about the matters of the Divine Martial Sect.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun said, "That's right, the Martial Ancestor's cultivation surpassed all past and present, he was the founder of the Martial Dao. You must know that the Great Grandmasters have a lifespan of 800 years, but the Martial Ancestor lived for 2,000 years before his final ascension."</p><p></p><p>"In that era before the emergence of the Sorcerers, a lifespan of 2,000 years is enough to explain many things."</p><p></p><p>"If not for the Martial Ancestor breaking through the limits of the Great Grandmasters, how could he have lived for so long!"</p><p></p><p>At this point,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun's expression also had a hint of envy.</p><p></p><p>2,000 years! This was a lifespan that all martial artists could hardly reach.</p><p></p><p>The Great Grandmasters' 800 years was already the limit for martial artists in the world.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Sorcerers became prevalent was not solely because Sorcerers of the same realm were stronger than martial artists, but also because Sorcerers generally had much longer lifespans.</p><p></p><p>Longevity!</p><p></p><p>For the vast majority of people, this was an irresistible temptation.</p><p></p><p>The lifespan of ordinary people was only about 180 years, and many were willing to exhaust their family fortunes just to extend their lives by a few years, let alone the difference of hundreds or thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>"One of the main reasons for the decline of the Martial Dao was that the lifespan of martial artists was not as long as that of Sorcerers!"</p><p></p><p>2,000 years -</p><p></p><p>Hearing this lifespan, Gu Qingfeng's heart was not particularly stirred.</p><p></p><p>After all, after achieving Perfect Body Refinement, his lifespan had already broken through 2,000 years, and later when he stepped into the ranks of the Extreme Dao Grandmasters, his lifespan even soared to 3,000 years.</p><p></p><p>Such a level of lifespan</p><p></p><p>was enough to be on par with the powerful figures at the Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>strictly speaking, the Extreme Dao Grandmasters were only benchmarked against the Grandmasters, while the Transformation Realm was benchmarked against the Great Grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>If the Perfect Martial Dao was widely disseminated, it would be able to break the advantage of the Sorcerers' lifespan. </p><p></p><p>Combined with the elevation of the level of life, the position of the Sorcerers would undoubtedly be severely impacted, and even their eventual extinction would not be impossible.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng would not rashly spread the Martial Dao he had created.</p><p></p><p>It was simply a matter of timing.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Longevity Sutra was not yet perfected, and if it was disseminated now, it would not have a great effect.</p><p></p><p>When the Longevity Sutra is further improved in the future, then disseminating it would have a different effect.</p><p></p><p>All these thoughts</p><p></p><p>flashed through Gu Qingfeng's mind in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his silence, Gu Yun thought Gu Qingfeng was doubting the truthfulness of his words, so he explained again.</p><p></p><p>"The words of this old man are not false. Nowadays, the world is corrupt, the order is in disarray, and the evil Sorcerers are causing havoc, making the common people unable to live in peace. This goes against the founding principles of our Divine Martial Sect.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the Martial Ancestor transmitted the Dao to the world, hoping to use the Martial Dao to resolve the calamities of the world. Alas, after the Martial Ancestor's ascension, no one was able to comprehend the legacy he left behind. As the current Sect Master of the Divine Martial Sect, I feel ashamed before my predecessors' dedication!"</p><p></p><p>"Now, Brother Gu is the only one who can match the true Great Grandmasters in strength, and also the only one who has the hope of inheriting the Martial Ancestor's legacy."</p><p></p><p>As the words reached this point, Gu Yun...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Cloud paused slightly, then let out a bitter smile.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I understand the concerns in Brother Gu's heart. Logically speaking, the inheritance of the Martial Ancestor is of great importance, and the Divine Martial Sect also has its own selfish motives, so they would not easily hand it over."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that the current situation in the world is such that Brother Gu must be well aware - the martial dao is gradually declining, and all the martial practitioners in the world are but blood food raised by the sorcerers."</p><p></p><p>"Since ancient times, there have indeed been many great masters in the world, but now only Brother Gu remains, and that is because those great martial masters have all fallen into the hands of the immortal sects and families, becoming their stepping stones for breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>"Now, sects like the Radiant Sword Sect and the Primal Origin Sect have gathered here, and their purpose is the same."</p><p></p><p>"If no supreme martial cultivator appears again, then the decline is only a matter of time!"</p><p></p><p>When Gu Yun said this, his expression had become somewhat sorrowful.</p><p></p><p>This is the predicament that martial practitioners now face.</p><p></p><p>To ordinary people, martial practitioners are those who wield great power, able to establish their own sects and enjoy boundless glory.</p><p></p><p>But only the truly powerful martial practitioners can understand the dire situation they are in.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when Gu Yun heard that Gu Qingfeng was a great master, he hurried to Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>And after entering Guangyang Prefecture and understanding the deeds of Gu Yang, the Guangyang King, he became even more determined in his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Yang took control of Guangyang Prefecture, he has been suppressing the sorcerer sects and families, and later even directly annihilated the Zhuo family and other aristocratic sects, clearly demonstrating his attitude.</p><p></p><p>In fact, another reason for the decline of the martial dao is that many martial practitioners, after reaching a certain level of cultivation, directly join the sorcerers.</p><p></p><p>Those who can openly defy the sorcerer sects and families like Gu Yang are indeed few and far between.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Gu Yun could be certain that Gu Yang's actions were undoubtedly guided by the great master Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Talented! Powerful! Hating evil as if it were his own!</p><p></p><p>Such a person is naturally suited to be part of the Divine Martial Sect.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Gu Yun had originally wanted to observe a bit more, but after witnessing Gu Qingfeng's remote slaying of Jiang Shidao, he could no longer sit still.</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, Gu Qingfeng said, "I understand the intentions of the Sect Master Gu. After the problem with the Radiant Sword Sect is resolved, I will find a time to visit the Divine Martial Sect."</p><p></p><p>"The Radiant Sword Sect has a profound foundation, and Gu Yutian has already reached the peak of the Transformation Realm, with the hope of breaking through to the Deific Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Although Brother Gu's strength is formidable, he may not have an absolute advantage against Gu Yutian.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if Brother Gu were to win, the gaze of the strong cultivators across the Nine Realms would all be focused on Guangyang Prefecture. They would never allow a great master who can defeat a peak Transformation Realm cultivator to live."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, it would be better for Brother Gu to directly abandon his current undertakings and return to the Divine Martial Sect with me.</p><p></p><p>As long as Brother Gu can obtain the Martial Ancestor's inheritance and break through the shackles of the great masters, regaining what was lost would be easy."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun advised sincerely.</p><p></p><p>In his view, regardless of whether Gu Qingfeng wins or loses, there is no benefit in the current situation.</p><p></p><p>If he loses, there is no need to say more. They would likely both perish in that battle.</p><p></p><p>If he wins, it would inevitably incur the wrath of all the sorcerers in the world, and endless streams of powerful cultivators would come, ultimately leading to Gu Qingfeng's demise.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, temporarily avoiding the limelight is the best course of action.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 145</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>But the same.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang also clearly understood one thing.</p><p></p><p>That is, his father has a great aversion to the existence of sorcerers.</p><p></p><p>Under the subtle influence, Gu Yang has developed some dislike towards all sorcerers in the world.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>From a broader perspective, temporarily yielding a step and accepting the Crimson Flame Sect would bring more benefits than drawbacks to the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>But if considered from a personal emotional standpoint, Gu Yang naturally did not want to get involved with them.</p><p></p><p>But the problem is.</p><p></p><p>Those who aspire to achieve great things do not get bogged down by minor details.</p><p></p><p>To obtain certain things, one often has to sacrifice others.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was somewhat undecided.</p><p></p><p>But now that Gu Qingfeng has delivered the message, Gu Yang no longer needs to be so conflicted.</p><p></p><p>Immediately.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang summoned Gu Yi and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Manor Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"Father has ordered, annihilate the Crimson Flame Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang handed the letter with the word "kill" written on it to Gu Yi, although the murderous intent had largely dissipated, there was still a trace remaining.</p><p></p><p>Even the remnants of that murderous intent could make a Grandmaster martial artist feel wary.</p><p></p><p>"Manor Lord, are you planning to send the main army to wipe out the Crimson Flame Sect, or just have the Shadow Guards handle it?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi asked.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang calmly said, "If we only let the Shadow Guards handle it, can they guarantee the destruction of the Crimson Flame Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Now the Shadow Guards have three Transcendent Grandmasters and ten Perfected Refiners, so eliminating the Crimson Flame Sect should not be a problem," Gu Yi replied without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"Good, since you are confident, then lead the Shadow Guards to go and destroy the Crimson Flame Sect. But even though the Crimson Flame Sect must be annihilated, the evil spirits within cannot be left unchecked.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guards must also remember to bring the items for sealing the evil spirits."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang instructed, then let Gu Yi lead the powerful Shadow Guards to the Crimson Flame Sect.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang also needed to block the news of the Crimson Flame Sect's destruction. Even if it couldn't be completely concealed, he must try to delay it as much as possible, and then use thunderous means to sweep across the various sects and families.</p><p></p><p>Only by doing so could he subdue the entire Guangyang Prefecture with the least cost, before the other sects and families had a chance to react.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise.</p><p></p><p>Once the news of the Crimson Flame Sect's destruction spread, those sects and families would likely fight to the death in resistance.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I still have too few powerful experts at my disposal. If I had enough Transcendent Grandmasters, I wouldn't have to go through so much trouble, and could directly suppress all the sects and families in the Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, if my father was willing to lend a hand, it would save me a lot of trouble..."</p><p></p><p>This thought only flashed through Gu Yang's mind for a moment.</p><p></p><p>His father was a Great Grandmaster, naturally he would not act rashly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's existence was more of a deterrent.</p><p></p><p>"But with Pei Jing's death, the Heaven Yang Sword Sect won't let it go easily. I've heard the Heaven Yang Sect has a top-tier Transformation Realm expert, capable of rivaling a Great Grandmaster.</p><p>If that Heaven Yang Sect Master were to intervene, it would be a considerable problem!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang mused.</p><p></p><p>But this level of matter was not something he could interfere with for now.</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Qingfeng dared to slay Pei Jing and openly confront the Heaven Yang Sword Sect, he must have the confidence to prevail.</p><p></p><p>After all these years by Gu Qingfeng's side, Gu Yang was well aware that his father never did anything without being certain of success.</p><p></p><p>Even facing such a powerful opponent, Gu Yang had an inexplicable confidence in Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>This confidence.</p><p></p><p>Was the capital that allowed him to not fear the Heaven Yang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at the sand table in front of him, and had already locked onto the next target.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Inside the Crimson Flame Sect.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Now the ground is littered with corpses.</p><p></p><p>The once majestic Patriarch of the Crimson Sun Sect, now disheveled, his clothes stained with blood, appears quite disheveled and wretched.</p><p></p><p>"My Crimson Flame Sect has already submitted, why does your Gu Family Village go back on its word!!"</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Lie was shocked and furious, looking at the Gu One before him, his heart filled with unwillingness to believe and anger.</p><p></p><p>It was something Ouyang Lie had not expected - that even though the Crimson Flame Sect had already bowed down, the Gu Family Village would still want to annihilate them.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Ouyang Lie also couldn't understand why the Gu Family Village had a reason to strike the Crimson Flame Sect.</p><p></p><p>If it was about some past grievances, but the Gu Family Village had not suffered any losses either, only the strong experts of the Crimson Flame Sect had perished.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, those who achieve great things do not get bogged down by trivial matters.</p><p></p><p>For a small and insignificant conflict to make the two sides unwilling to reconcile, that was simply impossible.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that Ouyang Lie had been completely unable to figure it out up to now.</p><p></p><p>Gu One remained silent, in his view, the dead had no need to understand so much.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this time he had come to exterminate the Crimson Flame Sect on Gu Yang's orders.</p><p></p><p>So, what Gu One had to do was to completely slaughter all the members of the Crimson Flame Sect, leaving not a single survivor.</p><p></p><p>In order to resolve the Crimson Flame Sect problem, Gu One directly led thirty elite guards.</p><p></p><p>Considering that the weakest of the elite guards were at the peak of the Washing Marrow Realm, thirty elite guards was a terrifying force.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, among the thirty elite guards, not all were ordinary guards, there were also five experts at the Refining Impurities Realm.</p><p></p><p>With such a force, it was enough to make the Crimson Flame Sect utterly hopeless.</p><p></p><p>Under Ouyang Lie's gaze, one by one, the strong experts of the Crimson Flame Sect were slaughtered, and many of the sect's elders were suppressed and beaten by the elite guards, with familiar faces becoming fewer and fewer.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, when Ouyang Lie was distracted, he was suddenly slashed by Gu One, breaking through his protective spiritual energy and leaving a gruesome wound on his body.</p><p></p><p>A large amount of fresh blood gushed out, causing Ouyang Lie's expression to turn frantic.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to destroy my Crimson Flame Sect, even if I die, I will make you perish with me!!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ouyang Lie no longer held back anything. He mobilized all the power within himself, and a terrifying and bizarre aura swept over like a tidal wave. When looking at Ouyang Lie again, his eyes had turned a deep green, as if an evil spirit had descended upon him.</p><p></p><p>For a cultivator, such an all-out battle could very likely lead to the awakening of the evil spirit within, making it impossible to control thereafter.</p><p></p><p>Normally, Ouyang Lie would not have done this.</p><p></p><p>But now, the crisis of life and death was right before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Lie no longer cared about anything else. The only thought in his mind was that even if he died, he must make the elite guards pay a price.</p><p></p><p>"Evil spirit!"</p><p></p><p>Gu One's expression remained unchanged, but his true qi surged like a mighty river, and the powerful blood qi gathered and infused into his long saber, elevating the power of the Seven Killing Saber Technique to an unprecedented level.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Rumble!!</p><p></p><p>The saber qi was shocking, sweeping across the area.</p><p></p><p>Even with Ouyang Lie's desperate final strike, he was no match for Gu One.</p><p></p><p>In less than a moment, with a flash of the saber, Ouyang Lie's head was severed from his body, his ferocious expression frozen on his face.</p><p></p><p>The next instant, the headless corpse collapsed heavily to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, an even more terrifying and chilling aura erupted.</p><p></p><p>With Ouyang Lie's demise, the evil spirit that had been suppressed within his physical body finally broke free.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>The price of the mid-grade martial arts was much higher than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, </p><p></p><p>the items that Gu Qingfeng had won at the auction were all delivered to him, and Gu Qingfeng promptly paid the corresponding amount of silver taels.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go back!"</p><p></p><p>As he walked out of the Cloud Pavilion, Gu Qingfeng saw other martial artists on the jianghu hurrying about, and a mysterious smile appeared on his face, then he said to Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>Back at the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng handed over the resources he had won at the auction to Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>"With these resources, your breakthrough to the Refine Skin Realm should be much easier."</p><p></p><p>"I will not disappoint Father's expectations!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>With one hundred thousand taels of silver worth of resources, if he still could not break through to the Refine Skin Realm, that would be too embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later,</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng returned.</p><p></p><p>"How did the investigation go?"</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the family lord, the information has been clearly investigated. The one who obtained the Scorching Sun Divine Palm this time is Yun Tianxing, the sect master of the Heavenly Cloud Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Cloud Sect.</p><p></p><p>When he heard the name of this sect, Gu Qingfeng's expression did not change.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Cloud Sect openly had several Blood Refining Realm martial artists stationed, rumored to be second only to the Qin family and the Iron Bone Gang.</p><p></p><p>In fact,</p><p></p><p>the forces that were able to win the Scorching Sun Divine Palm at the auction must have profound foundations, otherwise who could afford to spend two hundred thousand taels in one go.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>after hearing Meng Peng's words, Gu Qingfeng was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Where are the people from the Heavenly Cloud Sect now?"</p><p></p><p>"After the auction ended, the people from the Heavenly Cloud Sect immediately left. They should have already left White Stone City by now, but according to my observation, many people are secretly keeping an eye on the Heavenly Cloud Sect. </p><p></p><p>Their journey this time, I'm afraid, will not be too smooth!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was calm: "A top-tier mid-grade martial art that can directly point to the Refine Blood Realm, it's normal for the major forces to be tempted. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Qin family and the Iron Bone Gang may not be willing to see another powerful Refine Blood Realm expert emerge in the White Stone Dao."</p><p></p><p>"Does the family lord also have plans for the Scorching Sun Divine Palm?"</p><p></p><p>"Who wouldn't have plans for a top-tier mid-grade martial art? If the Heavenly Cloud Sect can obtain the Scorching Sun Divine Palm, why can't our Gu family? Let's go, they may already be engaging in battle outside the city, if we're too late, others might get their hands on it!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng left with his hands behind his back, and Meng Peng hurriedly followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>Outside White Stone City.</p><p></p><p>Killing suddenly erupted.</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Qingfeng had said, the people from the Heavenly Cloud Sect had not gone far from White Stone City when they were ambushed by various forces, the purpose of which was simply to seize the Scorching Sun Divine Palm.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>the Heavenly Cloud Sect this time also had powerful experts accompanying them.</p><p></p><p>Sect Master Yun Tianxing and two elders, a total of three Blood Refining Realm experts, many of those who tried to ambush and seize the Scorching Sun Divine Palm were slaughtered on the spot.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng and Meng Peng arrived outside the city, they saw that the place was already littered with corpses, and dozens of figures were engaged in fierce combat in the center, all for the sake of seizing the Scorching Sun Divine Palm.</p><p></p><p>"The people from the two major forces have indeed come!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng looked at the battle raging in the field, his expression filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>The two major forces he mentioned were naturally the Qin family and the Iron Bone Gang.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's gaze also turned to the battle in the field, although everyone was masked, he could still judge their identities based on their martial arts techniques.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This massacre of the Blood Refining Realm cultivators of the Sky Cloud Sect was extensive. Even though the Sky Cloud Sect was powerful, they were completely unable to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>In less than a moment, two mid-stage Blood Refining Realm elders of the Sky Cloud Sect had already fallen, slain on the spot under the siege of the many powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Yun Tianxing's eyes were about to burst, and the killing intent in his chest surged, but he was helpless.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that he could not escape, he directly threw out the brocade box containing the Scorching Sun Divine Palm, shouting fiercely, "The Scorching Sun Divine Palm is right here, you can take it if you have the ability!"</p><p></p><p>The words had barely fallen when Yun Tianxing had already retreated and fled.</p><p></p><p>The crowd who were originally fighting all paused their actions and rushed towards the brocade box without a second thought.</p><p></p><p>Yun Tianxing took this opportunity to directly leave the battlefield. After all, he had already suffered heavy injuries under the siege of the many powerful experts, and if he did not leave, his fate would be death.</p><p></p><p>"The Scorching Sun Divine Palm, this is mine!" </p><p></p><p>A hoarse voice of a masked old man sounded, his aura and blood surging, a long sword emitting an icy and terrifying cold light, directly forcing all the others to retreat.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to get the brocade box, a powerful expert broke through the sword light with his fists and palms colliding with the long sword, causing a metallic clanging sound.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to get the Scorching Sun Divine Palm, you'll have to ask if this old man agrees!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph—"</p><p></p><p>The scene descended into chaos. The Blood Refining Realm cultivators from various factions were fighting each other. Gu Qingfeng and Meng Peng were hiding in the dark, silently observing the changes in the situation.</p><p></p><p>Before long, more Blood Refining Realm cultivators fell, and some were severely injured and retreated.</p><p></p><p>Only the powerful experts from the two major factions remained, still fighting over the Scorching Sun Divine Palm.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time." </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes narrowed slightly. The remaining two major factions had a total of six Blood Refining Realm cultivators, but they were all heavily consumed. The longer the time was dragged out, the more variables would occur. </p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Qingfeng decided to take action.</p><p></p><p>He casually tore off a piece of cloth to cover his face, leaving only his eyes exposed, and instructed Meng Peng beside him to hide and not show himself, then directly took action.</p><p></p><p>"Boom—"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng burst out from the darkness like a giant bird, his palm reaching for the brocade box on the ground. Seeing someone taking action to seize it, the two major factions fighting each other actually cooperated, rushing towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, if you want to benefit from this, you'll have to ask us first!" </p><p></p><p>A Blood Refining Realm cultivator, seemingly from the Qin family, sneered, his long sword slashing through the air, as if he had already seen the scene of Gu Qingfeng being pierced through by his sword.</p><p></p><p>However, before the sword could reach him, Gu Qingfeng suddenly unleashed a powerful punch, colliding with the sword tip. The latter could not withstand the tremendous force and shattered instantly.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, Gu Qingfeng's arms shook the heavens, his overwhelming strength blocking all the attacks that came his way.</p><p></p><p>The attacks of the six Blood Refining Realm cultivators were comparable to toppling mountains and splitting rocks. Even though Gu Qingfeng had pushed the Iron Body Technique to its limit, his blood was still boiling restlessly.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to Gu Qingfeng, the other six were more shocked.</p><p></p><p>No one had expected that even with their combined forces, they not only failed to kill the opponent on the spot, but couldn't even severely injure him.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying strength of the newcomer made them suddenly feel a great threat.</p><p></p><p>But before they could be further shocked, Gu Qingfeng's majestic aura erupted, like rolling billows of smoke surging towards the sky. His fists struck out with the force to shake the heavens, and in the stunned gaze of everyone, he directly sent one of the Blood Refining Realm cultivators flying.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

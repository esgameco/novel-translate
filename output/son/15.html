        <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This was a mysterious force within the White Stone Path.</p><p></p><p>The other party never participated in the jianghu conflicts, only doing business.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, the strength of the Cloud Pavilion did not seem strong, but in Gu Qingfeng's eyes, the strength of the Cloud Pavilion was definitely not simple.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise,</p><p></p><p>How could they have the qualifications to firmly establish a foothold in the White Stone Path?</p><p></p><p>According to Gu Qingfeng's understanding, the Cloud Pavilion not only had a firm foundation in the White Stone Path, but also had a presence in other parts of the Taixuan Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>These matters were not really related to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>At least for now.</p><p></p><p>The relationship between them was not very close.</p><p></p><p>"A mid-grade martial art has appeared, I imagine all the major forces must be eager to obtain it. I should prepare some silver taels to see if I can acquire this martial art!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered for a moment, and had already made a decision.</p><p></p><p>Receiving the order,</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng immediately bowed and withdrew.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>The location of the Cloud Pavilion was in White Stone City, and the so-called White Stone Path was a collective term for the jianghu within a radius of five hundred li centered on White Stone City.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>It was not easy to establish a foothold in White Stone City.</p><p></p><p>Like the Gu family, it was because Gu Qingfeng had displayed sufficient strength that he was able to establish a firm foundation in White Stone City.</p><p></p><p>As for the Cloud Pavilion,</p><p></p><p>It was located in the most prosperous area of White Stone City, and the decoration was also magnificent. When Gu Qingfeng brought Gu Yang and Meng Peng to come, the Cloud Pavilion attendants hurriedly bowed to welcome them.</p><p></p><p>"The Gu family master has come!"</p><p></p><p>"En, I heard that the Cloud Pavilion is holding an auction, so I came to take a look."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly, his expression neither sad nor happy as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p></p><p>The attendant became even more respectful: "The Gu family master's arrival will surely bring glory to the Cloud Pavilion. Please follow me inside and have a seat!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the trouble."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng gave a slight smile, and then followed the attendant into the Cloud Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The others who were queuing outside the Cloud Pavilion, when they saw the people being led in by the attendant, most of them had expressions of envy and awe.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>There were also some who were dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't they have to queue up?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, can the rules of the Cloud Pavilion be casually broken?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these people's words, the others looked at them as if they were fools, and then another Cloud Pavilion attendant said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"The one who just entered was the Gu family master, whose cultivation has reached the Refining Blood Realm. If the gentlemen here are also Refining Blood Realm cultivators, they can enter ahead of the line!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this,</p><p></p><p>The previously dissatisfied people were completely silenced.</p><p></p><p>Refining Blood Realm cultivators! This was the top-tier expert in the White Stone Path.</p><p></p><p>Because the Gu family had only been in the White Stone Path for a few years, and Gu Qingfeng had always been low-key, not everyone had heard of the Gu family's name.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>The appearance of an unknown Refining Blood Realm cultivator and force would naturally attract the attention of many people.</p><p></p><p>There were indeed many people who knew about the existence of the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>On the other side,</p><p></p><p>In a certain restaurant outside the Cloud Pavilion, there were also a few people watching the events unfolding at the entrance of the Cloud Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"That must be the Gu family master. Judging from his robust aura, he is probably not too old."</p><p></p><p>One of them said slowly, his gaze full of seriousness.</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged Refining Blood Realm cultivator was not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Another person also nodded: "I heard that this Gu family master is not yet forty years old, but has already reached the Refining Blood Realm. With his talent, he may have the possibility of further advancement in the Refining Blood Realm in the future.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the young man beside him is rumored to be the Gu family's direct heir, and he has already entered the middle stage of the Refining Skin Realm at a young age.</p><p></p><p>But from the current situation, this Gu family heir also seems to be..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Not simple at all. The outside world has been rumoring that he is only at the middle stage of Refining Skin, but from observing his aura and demeanor, I'm afraid he has already reached the later stage of Refining Skin!"</p><p></p><p>These words caused a slight shock among the remaining few.</p><p></p><p>At this age, reaching the later stage of Refining Skin.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Sky Cloud Sect, they did not have such a prodigy.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone's gaze turned to the person in the main seat, who was the sect master of the Sky Cloud Sect, Yun Tianxing.</p><p></p><p>Seeing everyone looking at him, Yun Tianxing said calmly, "After this auction is over, it would be worth trying to approach the Gu family."</p><p></p><p>"What if the Gu family does not agree?"</p><p></p><p>"If they do not agree..."</p><p></p><p>Yun Tianxing smiled slightly, and a trace of cold chill emerged on his refined and amiable countenance.</p><p></p><p>"If they do not agree, then they will no longer have a place in the White Stone Dao."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The lord of the Gu family, please wait for a moment, the auction will officially begin in about half an hour!"</p><p></p><p>The attendant said respectfully, and then turned and gave some instructions. Soon, three palace maids in palace attire came in and served the group.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng glanced at the three maids, then looked towards the window of the private room, which provided a perfect view of the auction stage below. The position of the window was cleverly designed, allowing them to see the auction stage, but not the other private rooms.</p><p></p><p>"Master Gu, this is the detailed list of items for this auction, please take a look," a gracefully-built maid approached Gu Qingfeng, holding a gilded invitation in her hand, her voice soft and gentle.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at her and asked calmly, "What is your name?"</p><p></p><p>"I am called Qiushui, my lord," the maid replied with an increasingly charming smile, her slender jade fingers lightly touching Gu Qingfeng's palm as she handed him the gilded invitation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly, "Qiushui, that's a nice name. How long have you been working at the Cloud Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>"I have been at the Cloud Pavilion for about a year, my lord," Qiushui answered.</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm," Gu Qingfeng hummed softly, then fell silent. Seeing this, Qiushui did not say anything further, only standing by Gu Qingfeng's side to pour tea and water for him.</p><p></p><p>As for the other two maids, they were attending to Gu Yang and Meng Peng. The former was a young man, who was flustered by the enthusiastic service of the maid, while the latter was an experienced old hand, but dared not be too presumptuous with Gu Qingfeng present.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Gu Qingfeng opened the invitation and scanned the contents. On the last page, he saw the information about the mid-grade martial art being auctioned - the Scorching Sun Divine Palm, created by the Scorching Sun Immortal in the past. If mastered to the peak, it could lead one to the realm of Blood Refinement Perfection.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes lit up. Martial arts in the world were divided into three types: the first focused on cultivation, the second on techniques, and the third combined both. The Scorching Sun Divine Palm belonged to the third category, like the Collapse Mountain Fist, where both cultivation and techniques were integrated, allowing the practitioner to enhance their overall strength.</p><p></p><p>The Iron Body Sutra, on the other hand, leaned more towards the first type. The Scorching Sun Divine Palm, like the Collapse Mountain Fist, was the most valuable of the three, as mastering both cultivation and techniques would provide a complete inheritance.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

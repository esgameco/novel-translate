        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Recruiting Guards.</p><p></p><p>To expand a family.</p><p></p><p>It is impossible to rely on just two people.</p><p></p><p>After Gu Qingfeng demonstrated the power of a Refiner's Realm martial artist, many jianghu martial artists were willing to join the Gu family and become their guards.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the backing of the Gu family, which has a Refiner's Realm martial artist as its pillar, it is a good thing.</p><p></p><p>More importantly,</p><p></p><p>The Gu family has a Refiner's Realm martial artist as its mainstay, which means they must have a corresponding martial arts heritage.</p><p></p><p>If one can gain the favor of the Gu family patriarch, perhaps they can also obtain this kind of heritage.</p><p></p><p>For jianghu martial artists, the higher the level of martial arts heritage, the more difficult it is to obtain.</p><p></p><p>The prosperity of the Baishi Dao's martial arts is like a fish swimming across a river, but there have never been many Refiner's Realm martial artists, and this is due to the lack of heritage.</p><p></p><p>Even the major powers, if they possess the heritage of Refiner's Realm martial arts, would not casually pass it on, so for ordinary jianghu wanderers, the martial arts of the Refiner's Realm are greatly coveted.</p><p></p><p>All the powerful families and sects with Refiner's Realm martial artists as their mainstay are the targets for these jianghu wanderers to join.</p><p></p><p>Not for other reasons.</p><p></p><p>They only want to find an opportunity to break through to a higher level.</p><p></p><p>Do not underestimate the shallow foundation of the Gu family created by Gu Qingfeng, but there are still around fifty to sixty martial artists willing to join the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>Among these fifty to sixty people, the weakest are at the middle stage of Refiner's Realm, and the strongest are at the peak of Refiner's Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for Refiner's Realm martial artists, there is not a single one.</p><p></p><p>After all, such powerful experts can establish their own forces, how could they submit to others.</p><p></p><p>Since the establishment of the Gu family, Gu Qingfeng has been low-key in his development, independently developing some industries, but without any drastic actions.</p><p></p><p>It's still the same old saying.</p><p></p><p>The waters of the Baishi Dao are very deep.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng knows his strength is not bad, but he has no intention of directly confronting the various forces of the Baishi Dao.</p><p></p><p>At least,</p><p></p><p>As long as his strength is not enough to suppress the entire Baishi Dao, he will maintain a low profile.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>There is a prerequisite for this.</p><p></p><p>That is, no one else provokes him.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Gu Qingfeng will not be polite.</p><p></p><p>Since the establishment of the Gu family, Gu Qingfeng has also secretly investigated the situation in Linxian County, but he is disappointed to find that Linxian County seems to have disappeared into thin air, and no matter how he inquires, there is still no news.</p><p></p><p>This shows that,</p><p></p><p>Linxian County must have encountered some other changes.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Qingfeng has no intention of returning to Linxian County to investigate the situation in person.</p><p></p><p>After all, Linxian County is mysterious, and it involves the ZhenxieÂè∏, so Gu Qingfeng does not want to invite trouble.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand,</p><p></p><p>During his time in the Baishi Dao, Gu Qingfeng has also inquired about the situation of the demonic creatures.</p><p></p><p>But just like in Linxian County, ordinary people know nothing about the demonic creatures, and it is the major powers that seem to have some understanding of the demonic creatures.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng cannot directly ask them about these matters.</p><p></p><p>From this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has determined one thing.</p><p></p><p>That is, the Taixuan Dynasty has strict control over the problem of the demonic creatures, and the news about them will not be easily leaked out.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took out the Tong Ling Treasure Art again.</p><p></p><p>This is the secret manual he obtained from the corpse of Shangguan Jiang.</p><p></p><p>The Tong Ling Treasure Art,</p><p></p><p>Records how to become a shaman.</p><p></p><p>That's right.</p><p></p><p>A shaman.</p><p></p><p>From the Tong Ling Treasure Art, Gu Qingfeng finally understood the true reason for Shangguan Jiang's condition.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Come.</p><p></p><p>By bearing the evil spirit within oneself, one can master the power of the evil spirit and become a true sorcerer.</p><p></p><p>Once the sorcerer perishes, the evil spirit sealed within their body will awaken.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore,</p><p></p><p>After becoming a sorcerer, there are also various restrictions and flaws.</p><p></p><p>First, the sorcerer will be influenced by the evil spirit, becoming bloodthirsty and insane. The more they utilize the power of the evil spirit, the more they will be eroded by it, eventually dying and becoming a true evil spirit.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Sorcerers also have methods to suppress the evil spirit, allowing them to better control the power of the evil spirit and thus ascend to higher levels.</p><p></p><p>The Divination Treasure Art does not record much, only the method of bearing a type of evil spirit called the Heart-Devouring Demon, as well as the subsequent cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>The method of bearing the Heart-Devouring Demon is to first use gold as the vessel, suppressing and sealing an evil spirit. Then, one must pour the blood from the hearts of a hundred people onto the golden vessel, followed by bathing in human blood for a hundred days, and using the five viscera and other ingredients as medicinal supplements. Only then can one ultimately bear the evil spirit.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>Such methods are not guaranteed to succeed.</p><p></p><p>If one fails, they will be devoured by the evil spirit.</p><p></p><p>If successful, one can master the power of the evil spirit and become a true sorcerer.</p><p></p><p>After becoming a sorcerer, one also needs to consume the fresh blood and five viscera of animals to aid in their cultivation. Consuming human blood and viscera would produce the best effects.</p><p></p><p>These are all recorded in the Divination Treasure Art.</p><p></p><p>"Sorcerers... evil spirits, if we simply look at the methods recorded in the Divination Treasure Art, what difference is there between these so-called sorcerers and the evil spirits? The tragic incidents that occurred in Linxian, if I'm not mistaken, should all have been the doings of Shangguan Jiang!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Judging from Shangguan Jiang's performance, sorcerers are undoubtedly much more powerful than martial artists. According to the records in the Divination Treasure Art, he should belong to the weakest category of sorcerers.</p><p></p><p>Yet even so, he possesses strength comparable to the Blood Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>If it were a more powerful sorcerer, martial artists at the Blood Refining Realm would likely be no different from ants before them.</p><p></p><p>In comparison,</p><p></p><p>The martial artists who can cultivate to the Blood Refining Realm are already considered quite formidable in the jianghu. On the White Stone Dao, they can even be considered as strong individuals.</p><p></p><p>From this, one can see the gap between martial artists and sorcerers.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Becoming a sorcerer is also extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng is aware that if this Divination Treasure Art in his hands were to be leaked, it would likely cause a huge uproar, with countless people unable to resist the desire to seize it.</p><p></p><p>After all, the yearning for greater power is a common human sentiment.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>This idea is just a passing thought for Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>The Divination Treasure Art is related to the Exorcism Bureau, an institution established by the Taiyan Dynasty. He is not so naive as to believe that, with his mere Blood Refining Realm cultivation, he can contend against it.</p><p></p><p>"If it were the me from back then, perhaps I would have dared to take the risk and cultivate the Divination Treasure Art. After all, in this chaotic world, human life is as insignificant as grass.</p><p></p><p>Only by grasping great power can one truly survive, and only by living can one have the right to discuss other matters.</p><p></p><p>But for me now, the Divination Treasure Art holds no use. As long as I obtain enough cultivation points, breaking through to higher realms will be as easy as turning my hand over!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng is clear about his advantages - nurturing Gu Yang and helping him break through to higher levels.</p><p></p><p>Additionally,</p><p></p><p>Regarding the Golden Finger, there are still many aspects Gu Qingfeng has not fully understood.</p><p></p><p>Now that he has established a foundation on the White Stone Dao, he has ample time to slowly research the other functions of the Golden Finger.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

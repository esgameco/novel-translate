        <h1>Chapter 40</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Refining with Full Effort!</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng mobilized the power of his qi and blood, frantically absorbing the medicinal power from the medicinal bath and medicinal soup, and then mobilizing the power of the Scorching Sun Palm to gradually refine his own bones.</p><p></p><p>Under the self-refinement of the Scorching Sun Palm, a portion of Gu Qingfeng's bones had already been successfully refined. Now, what he needed to do was to refine the remaining bones completely.</p><p></p><p>However—</p><p></p><p>When the bone refinement was halfway through, Gu Qingfeng stopped.</p><p></p><p>It was not because he wanted to stop.</p><p></p><p>But because his body had reached its limit, and the power of the medicinal soup had also been exhausted.</p><p></p><p>Breakthrough the Bone Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was not achieved in one breath.</p><p></p><p>Any warrior who steps into the Bone Refining Realm needs a long time to grind and refine the bones bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>After coming out of the bathtub, Gu Qingfeng glanced at the slightly blackish-brown medicinal bath, put on his robe, and then went outside to continue practicing the sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>The long sword was unsheathed.</p><p>The sword light was crisp and cold.</p><p>In the crisscrossing of the long sword, the sword qi could be vaguely seen rampaging, leaving white traces in the air that did not dissipate.</p><p></p><p>"Boom—"</p><p>The sword qi rolled like thunderous roars, and the myriad sword shadows gathered into a single sword, unleashing a soul-stirring explosion.</p><p></p><p>At this point.</p><p>The Heaven Thunder Sword Technique was mastered!</p><p></p><p>"This mid-grade martial art has finally been formally entered!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had a faint smile on his face. He had obtained the Heaven Thunder Sword Technique for several months, but he had always been at the doorstep, unable to truly enter the introductory stage.</p><p></p><p>Now, with this breakthrough in one breath, it could be considered not bad.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven Thunder Sword Technique was mastered.</p><p>The profundity of this mid-grade martial art was truly glimpsed for the first time.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p>The Iron Leg Technique had also reached the Perfection Realm.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng consumed a point of improvement to directly upgrade the Iron Leg Technique to Perfection.</p><p></p><p>At the moment the Iron Leg Technique reached Perfection, he felt that the muscles and skin of his legs were taut, as if they had turned into pure iron, and his qi and blood had also increased slightly, but the changes were not too significant.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the lower-grade martial arts no longer have much effect on me. Only when the lower-grade martial arts reach Perfection can they bring some enhancements.</p><p>However, even so, the enhancements are limited!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng understood that his current realm was too high, and the changes that lower-grade martial arts could bring were already quite limited.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p>If a martial art reaches Perfection, it will still have some effect.</p><p>If it's just one martial art, perhaps it won't be noticeable, but if it's accumulated from tens or hundreds of martial arts, Gu Qingfeng believed that his strength would certainly reach a terrifying level.</p><p></p><p>At that time,</p><p>Even if he had not broken through the Bone Refining Realm, he reckoned he could still suppress the Bone Refining Realm with ease.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p>To reach that level would not be a matter of a day or two.</p><p></p><p>With so many improvement points, why should Gu Qingfeng use them to break the limits of martial arts? Why bother accumulating these lower-grade martial arts?</p><p>It was only when the remaining improvement points had little use that Gu Qingfeng would use them to upgrade the Iron Leg Technique, allowing this great martial art to reach Perfection directly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the following days,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng basically spent his time tempering his flesh and refining his bones, accelerating his breakthrough to the Bone Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye,</p><p>A month had passed.</p><p></p><p>On this day,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng was exactly thirty-six years old.</p><p>It was also the same day.</p><p>The realm he had been stuck in for a long time, the half-step Bone Refining Realm, finally broke through.</p><p></p><p>"Boom—"</p><p>All 365 bones in his body were completely refined, and the powerful strength within his flesh and blood was revived, giving Gu Qingfeng the illusion that he could kill a half-step Bone Refining cultivator with a single punch.</p><p></p><p>No—</p><p>This was not an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Awake! His 365 bones have been tempered and perfected, as if breaking free from the shackles of his limits. Gu Qingfeng's entire being has been sublimated, and his strength has increased exponentially, more than doubling what it was before. If he were to face his former self who had not yet broken through, Gu Qingfeng is confident he could defeat that version of himself in three moves or less.</p><p></p><p>If he were to face an ordinary half-step Refined Bone cultivator, it would likely be a one-punch victory.</p><p></p><p>—</p><p></p><p>"Boom—"</p><p></p><p>A punch shattered the artificial mountain.</p><p></p><p>He then grabbed a rock, and with just a slight squeeze of his fingers, it crumbled into powder.</p><p></p><p>"This is the power of the Refined Bone realm!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems I have underestimated the formidable strength of this realm in the past."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Before breaking through to the Refined Bone realm, Gu Qingfeng did not have a deep understanding of this cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>But in this moment, he finally witnessed the true power of the Refined Bone realm.</p><p></p><p>That previous punch, </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had only used a fraction of his strength, yet it was enough to split mountains and crush stones - a terrifying display of power.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng  Age: 36/150  Realm: Early Refined Bone</p><p></p><p>Martial Arts: Gu Family Fist (Unbreakable Lv.1), Iron Body Technique (Iron Body Lv.1), Great Slab-Throwing Hand (Proficient), Iron Leg Technique (Perfected), Refining Iron Finger (Proficient), Scorching Sun Divine Palm (Perfected Scorching Sun Palm Lv.4), Heaven Thunder Sword Technique (Beginner)  Upgrade Points: 0...</p><p></p><p>"Early Refined Bone!"</p><p></p><p>"A lifespan of 150 years!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes shone with brilliance.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators at the Blood Refining realm only have a lifespan of around 100 years, but upon breaking through to the Refined Bone realm, their lifespan directly increases to 150 years.</p><p></p><p>Fifty extra years of life.</p><p></p><p>This was no trivial matter.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the higher one's cultivation, the more their lifespan may continue to increase.</p><p></p><p>In that case,</p><p></p><p>in the future, if he were to reach even greater heights, he might just have a chance at the legendary Martial Dao Immortality.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Dao Immortality!"</p><p></p><p>"With my advantages, I may not be without a chance to achieve Martial Dao Immortality one day!"</p><p></p><p>The thought of immortality stirred the calm waters of Gu Qingfeng's heart.</p><p></p><p>No one can resist the allure of immortality.</p><p></p><p>However, for ordinary people, attaining Martial Dao Immortality is an extremely difficult feat. But Gu Qingfeng has his own advantages, and he may just have a chance to one day reach that realm.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng quickly calmed himself.</p><p></p><p>Martial Dao Immortality is still far too distant for him.</p><p></p><p>For now, he has only just barely broken through to the Refined Bone realm.</p><p></p><p>The jianghu is vast.</p><p></p><p>The strong cultivators of the Refined Bone realm are not necessarily that powerful.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>on the White Stone Path, the Refined Bone realm would already be considered the pinnacle.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng arrived at the Cloud Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Given the reputation of the Gu Family, the manager of the Cloud Pavilion promptly came out to welcome him.</p><p></p><p>In the side room,</p><p></p><p>a maidservant served tea.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Pavilion manager who came out to greet him was not Jiang Ping, but another woman. Her countenance was beautiful, and her attire was dignified, exuding a graceful charm with every gesture.</p><p></p><p>"I am Chai Hong, the current manager of the Cloud Pavilion. I wonder if the Lord of the Gu Family has any instructions for me today?"</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that the Cloud Pavilion's business is thriving, so I've come to inquire if you have any high-grade martial arts for sale. If so, I would be interested in purchasing them."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was not swayed by Chai Hong's beauty; her appearance did not stir his heart much. He went straight to the point, stating the purpose of his visit.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

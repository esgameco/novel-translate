        <h1>Chapter 95</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin looked at the scrolls above, his brow slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"The place where the evil spirit first appeared had nothing special about it, until an entire village's people completely disappeared, which then drew the attention of others.</p><p></p><p>Then the government officials successively sent people to investigate, but they all disappeared without a trace, only then confirming that it was the work of the evil spirit!"</p><p></p><p>"And later, the Nine Curved Sword Sect was destroyed."</p><p></p><p>"The government also has very little record about the evil spirit, basically all of it is here, Lord Jiang can take a look!"</p><p></p><p>The Prefect of Yunshan spoke.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin nodded, and then said, "You officials should send a few people to accompany me to the Nine Curved Sword Sect for a visit!"</p><p></p><p>"My lord, why the hurry? I have already prepared a feast, why don't we wait until we have had our fill of food and drink, and then we can go to the Nine Curved Sword Sect together?"</p><p></p><p>The Prefect of Yunshan smiled apologetically.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin shook his head slightly: "If the problem of the evil spirit is not resolved, I will not be able to sleep or eat in peace!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since Lord Jiang is so insistent, then I shall have my men follow Lord Jiang."</p><p></p><p>The Prefect of Yunshan no longer forced the issue, and then had his subordinates gather outside the government office to wait and then follow Jiang Qin and the others to the Nine Curved Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>This time, </p><p></p><p>to investigate the matter of the Nine Curved Path.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Subduing Bureau not only sent Jiang Qin, but also several Demon Subduing Envoys.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Demon Subduing Envoys,</p><p></p><p>are actually the main personnel under the Demon Subduing Bureau responsible for dealing with evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>Each Demon Subduing Envoy is a skilled practitioner who has cultivated evil spirits, their strength is not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Among them,</p><p></p><p>some powerful Demon Subduing Envoys have even reached the Spiritual Refinement Realm, or even become masters of the Spirit Control Realm.</p><p></p><p>Now,</p><p></p><p>the five people Jiang Qin brought were all Spirit Control Realm practitioners.</p><p></p><p>The reason for this was that the evil spirit of the Nine Curved Path was not simple, and for the sake of stability, if the trace of the evil spirit was discovered, they must suppress it with full force.</p><p></p><p>Five Spirit Control Realm Demon Subduing Envoys.</p><p></p><p>Adding Jiang Qin,</p><p></p><p>that would be a total of six Spirit Control Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>This force was almost half the strength of the Demon Subduing Bureau of Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"My lord, there seems to be a problem here!"</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the Nine Curved Sword Sect, one of the Demon Subduing Envoys furrowed his brow, looking at the surroundings, his expression not looking too good.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin asked, "What's the problem?"</p><p></p><p>"Shh!"</p><p></p><p>"My lord, don't you feel that the entire Nine Curved Sword Sect is too quiet!?"</p><p></p><p>Ling Xianzhong said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Before joining the Demon Subduing Bureau, he had also worked for the court, and had solved many cases, so he was particularly sensitive to any trace of activity.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p></p><p>one of the Demon Subduing Envoys immediately laughed, "Quiet? Isn't that normal, since everyone in the Nine Curved Sword Sect is dead, how can it not be quiet?"</p><p></p><p>"No..."</p><p></p><p>Ling Xianzhong shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"The quiet I'm talking about is not this kind of quiet, not only the Nine Curved Sword Sect, but ever since we set foot in Yunshan City, there seems to be something off."</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Curved Sword Sect was destroyed, the evil spirit of the Nine Curved Path has been widely rumored, but have we seen any civilians in a state of panic?"</p><p></p><p>These words,</p><p></p><p>caused the expressions of the others to finally change.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin's expression became solemn: "Ling Xianzhong is right, since we entered Yunshan City, everything seems to have become different, everything is too quiet, quiet to an unbelievable degree!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this,</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin looked at the few constables who had followed, only to see them staring fixatedly at him, their smiles unnaturally stiff.</p><p></p><p>In an instant,</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin struck out with a palm, directly hitting one of the constables, who suddenly shattered, blood and flesh flying.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>even with this constable dead, the other constables still stood there motionless.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Once again, Jiang Qin struck, slaying the remaining few constables.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin's brow furrowed deeper.</p><p></p><p>"Strange!"</p><p></p><p>"It's truly strange!"</p><p></p><p>The constables were like puppets, allowing themselves to be slaughtered, their flesh and blood exploding, but there was no trace of bloodiness.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the others also finally noticed the anomaly.</p><p></p><p>"Fake!"</p><p></p><p>"It's all fake!"</p><p></p><p>The members of the Exorcism Bureau had a look of alarm on their faces.</p><p></p><p>If everything they had witnessed so far was false, then what kind of existence could have silently enveloped them in this illusion.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin's long saber suddenly unsheathed, and he unleashed the full force of his spiritual power, a terrifying and icy aura bursting forth, crashing down towards the front.</p><p></p><p>Rip!</p><p></p><p>The space in front of them tore open like a curtain.</p><p></p><p>A new scene.</p><p></p><p>Appeared before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Swords Sect had vanished, and they found themselves on the streets of Cloud Mountain City, but it was different from the previous Cloud Mountain City - the entire city was shrouded in a deathly silence, as if drenched in blood.</p><p></p><p>And in the sky above Cloud Mountain City, a towering Buddha stood, holding a flower and smiling, but its expression was not at all benevolent, only eerie and grim, with two streams of bloody tears flowing from its eyes, its pupils staring fixatedly at them.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p></p><p>Several members of the Exorcism Bureau let out agonizing screams, the evil forces they had suppressed now violently resurfacing, a terrifying and icy aura erupting forth.</p><p></p><p>Only Jiang Qin and Ling Xianzhong were able to barely suppress the outbreak of this evil power.</p><p></p><p>Yet even so, their faces were filled with a sense of despair.</p><p></p><p>"Forbidden Zone!"</p><p></p><p>"This is a calamity-level evil spiritâ€”"</p><p></p><p>Ling Xianzhong's expression was one of sheer terror.</p><p></p><p>A calamity-level evil spirit! That was an existence that had already mastered the Forbidden Zone! No wonder! No wonder they had not detected anything amiss earlier.</p><p></p><p>For the moment they set foot in Cloud Mountain City, they had already fallen under the influence of the evil spirit, trapped in the illusion created by the Forbidden Zone.</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin's face turned deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>"Evil Buddha!"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, It had once been evenly matched with the predecessors of the Exorcism Bureau, how could it have recovered to a calamity-level power so quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The Evil Buddha!</p><p></p><p>This was the evil spirit that the Exorcism Bureau had been pursuing all along.</p><p></p><p>Even before the news of the Nine Swords Dao had reached them, Jiang Qin had already considered this possibility, which was why he had personally led five Spiritual Realm cultivators here.</p><p></p><p>A severely weakened calamity-level evil spirit, even with its power greatly diminished, would still be beyond the abilities of ordinary cultivators to handle.</p><p></p><p>To subdue it,</p><p></p><p>Only the joint efforts of many powerful experts would suffice.</p><p></p><p>But now, Jiang Qin realized he had underestimated the situation - this evil spirit had somehow regained its calamity-level power, and had laid waste to the entire Cloud Mountain City, turning it into a so-called Forbidden Zone.</p><p></p><p>Trapped in the Forbidden Zone,</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin could not help but feel a sense of despair welling up within him.</p><p></p><p>At that moment.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the heavens and earth, a Buddhist chant resounded, but this chant was devoid of any righteous energy, instead exuding an aura of utmost eeriness. Next to him, Ling Xianzhong could no longer suppress the evil forces within, and his physical body exploded.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin turned and rushed towards the outskirts of Cloud Mountain City.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>The Buddha in the void suddenly moved, its blood-red palm reaching down towards him. Jiang Qin felt the sky darken, and as he looked up, he saw the crimson patterns on the Buddha's palm.</p><p></p><p>"Noâ€”"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

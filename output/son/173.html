        <h1>Chapter 173</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Before entering the Nine Curve Path, even though Gu Peng had greatly underestimated the power of the Demonic Buddha, he was still confident that with his innate Patriarch-level cultivation, he could retreat safely even if he couldn't defeat it.</p><p></p><p>But now, </p><p></p><p>Gu Peng realized how naive his thoughts were.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Buddha's strength,</p><p></p><p>was far beyond what a Patriarch-level cultivator could compare to.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Buddha, after another transformation, was like an ant before it, even for a Patriarch-level cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"You shall retreat!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stepped into the void, his overwhelming true qi and blood power erupting, like the great sun illuminating the void, causing all the cold and eerie auras to suddenly dissipate.</p><p></p><p>He struck out with a punch.</p><p></p><p>Sun and moon in the sky!</p><p></p><p>This was the first move of the Sun and Moon Fist Classic, a supreme sect art. But combined with Gu Qingfeng's current Dao Patriarch-level power, even just this first move unleashed earth-shattering fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>Spatial distortions and tremors radiated from the center of Gu Qingfeng's fist.</p><p></p><p>When the Demonic Buddha's palm pressed down, the two forces collided, and rolling shockwaves swept across the eight directions.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng, who had been hovering in the air, fell straight down.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, dust and smoke rose.</p><p></p><p>This scene,</p><p></p><p>made Gu Peng's expression change drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Old Patriarch..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, the dust cleared, and Gu Qingfeng stood firmly on the ground. The earth within a ten-zhang radius had sunken in by over a zhang, forming a terrifying crater.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that without some tricks, you are not my match!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the Demonic Buddha floating in the void, meeting its bloodshot eyes, and a faint smile appeared on his face, though it looked rather sinister.</p><p></p><p>This strike just now,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was only testing the Demonic Buddha's strength.</p><p></p><p>The result was clear.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Buddha's power was more terrifying than the so-called Transformation Realm and Martial Dao Grand Masters. Even among the Calamity-level Demonic Entities, it was a true top-tier existence.</p><p></p><p>Even with Gu Qingfeng's current Dao Patriarch foundation, in a normal confrontation, he would have difficulty being the Demonic Buddha's match.</p><p></p><p>However—</p><p></p><p>This only applied to normal combat.</p><p></p><p>After witnessing the Demonic Buddha's power, Gu Qingfeng no longer held back. He activated the two great Heavenly Veins, gathering the mighty power of Heaven and Earth around him. The blood qi that was already as scorching as the great sun now surged even higher towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>The great sun in the void.</p><p>Blood qi like a rainbow!</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stepped, shattering the ground, and his entire body shot up, directly charging towards the Demonic Buddha.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Boom! Rumble!!</p><p></p><p>In the sky above the ancient city, two terrifying powers erupted and ravaged, the thunderous waves spreading in all directions.</p><p></p><p>The massive sounds could be clearly heard not only within the Nine Curve Path, but even outside of it.</p><p></p><p>Many people looked towards the direction of the Nine Curve Path and saw a great sun illuminating the void, shining in harmony with the original sun in the sky - a shocking phenomenon that shook all directions.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after,</p><p></p><p>some people also saw the bloodstained Buddha floating in the void beneath the sun, with eerie Buddhist chants faintly echoing, as if it were a demonic spirit from the underworld, instilling fear in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"That is the Demonic Buddha of the Nine Curve Path!"</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to engage in battle with that Demonic Buddha!"</p><p></p><p>"Sss..."</p><p></p><p>Many martial artists had expressions of shock.</p><p></p><p>The existence of the Demonic Buddha,</p><p></p><p>was no secret to many people.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Buddha's terrifying power had not only wiped out all life in the Nine Curve Path, but also captured all the powerful experts who entered it, whether they were from the Demon-Subduing Manor or the top sects.</p><p></p><p>Once someone entered the Nine Curve Path, there was no return.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>for the Demonic Buddha...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The terror of the Buddha, they had deep personal experience of it.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>Now, a mysterious powerful expert has delved into the Nine Twists Path and engaged in a battle with that evil Buddha. How could they not be shocked?</p><p></p><p>However, very soon.</p><p></p><p>Someone softly said, "In the entire Guangyang Prefecture, aside from the one from the Gu Family Manor, who else has the qualifications to enter the Nine Twists Path and fight that evil Buddha!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The others were momentarily stunned, but then they also became calm.</p><p></p><p>Indeed.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Guangyang Prefecture, who else has the qualifications to fight the evil Buddha of the Nine Twists Path.</p><p></p><p>The only one truly capable of doing so would be that Overlord Saber.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that the one from the Gu Family Manor has cultivated martial arts to a transcendent and saintly level, able to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Martial Ancestor from tens of thousands of years ago. Now it seems the rumors are not false!"</p><p></p><p>Some martial artists, seeing that awe-inspiring and domineering aura like the proud sun, had shock in their eyes, as well as an undisguised longing.</p><p></p><p>This is the pursuit of us martial artists!</p><p></p><p>There were also some external martial artists who had heard of Gu Qingfeng's reputation and came upon hearing the news. When they witnessed the terrifying fluctuations of the Nine Twists Path, their faces were also filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>A Martial Dao Saint!</p><p></p><p>The reputation is well-deserved!</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>Boom! Suppression!</p><p>Exerting full force to suppress!</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng activated two great celestial veins, unleashing his full strength, and the Sun and Moon Fist Classic in his hands displayed a power far surpassing that of its original founder.</p><p></p><p>Sun and Moon as One with Heaven!</p><p>Mountains and Rivers Extinguished!</p><p>The Cosmos Returned to Nothingness!</p><p></p><p>The three techniques of the Sun and Moon Fist Classic all contained the mighty power to shatter mountains, split rivers, and destroy.</p><p></p><p>Even with the evil Buddha's formidable strength, when faced with Gu Qingfeng's current level of attack, its golden body was stained with blood and cracked, falling into a complete disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>"Boom—"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng unleashed another punch, the power of destruction erupting, directly destroying one of the evil Buddha's palms.</p><p></p><p>Flesh and blood shattered, bones turned to dust.</p><p></p><p>The excruciating pain made the evil Buddha let out a painful roar, and more sinister and icy powers surged in like a tidal wave, as if the countless fallen souls it had devoured were now crawling out from the depths of hell.</p><p></p><p>"Saber, come!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was cold as he shouted.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Demon-Slaying Saber in Gu Peng's hand was summoned, directly leaving its sheath and turning into a blood-colored radiant light that fell into Gu Qingfeng's hand.</p><p></p><p>The moment he grasped the hilt.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's aura underwent a sudden change.</p><p></p><p>Celestial veins activated.</p><p>Qi and blood surged like a torrent.</p><p></p><p>The supreme Overlord Saber Dao cultivated from slaying powerful experts was instantly condensed to its peak.</p><p></p><p>"Slay!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng uttered a single word, and the Demon-Slaying Saber ruthlessly descended upon the evil Buddha.</p><p></p><p>Rumble—</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored saber qi sliced through space, and wherever the power reached, it manifested a web-like pitch-black color. All the fallen souls and sinister icy powers were directly dispersed before this sword.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>The evil Buddha's eyes were filled with bloody tears, and its remaining palm reached out to grab the blood-colored saber qi.</p><p></p><p>In the next breath.</p><p>The palm was shattered.</p><p></p><p>The momentum of the blood-colored saber qi did not stop, directly slicing through the evil Buddha's body, lingering for a long time over a distance of hundreds of miles.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>One breath! Two breaths!</p><p>Three breaths!</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The entire Nine Twists Path fell into a strange silence for several breaths, and then suddenly, a blood-colored saber mark appeared on the evil Buddha's suspended figure in the void.</p><p></p><p>As time passed.</p><p>This saber mark expanded at a visible speed.</p><p></p><p>In less than a moment, the saber mark had pierced through the entire evil Buddha.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after.</p><p>The evil Buddha's body split into two halves, and blood sprayed across the heavens.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

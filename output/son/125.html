        <h1>Chapter 125</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang left.</p><p></p><p>He was digesting the words that Gu Qingfeng had said earlier.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts of the world have flaws!</p><p>Perfect martial arts!</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was secretly touched, but since he was only at the Blood Refining stage, he naturally didn't have much understanding.</p><p></p><p>However, </p><p>he was now trying his best to improve his own strength, and he had accumulated a lot of cultivation resources from the many sects he had destroyed over the past half year.</p><p></p><p>Aside from secretly training, the remaining resources were more than enough for his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had a premonition.</p><p>At the fastest, in half a year, at the latest, in a year, he would be able to break through to the perfect Blood Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p>looking at the current situation,</p><p>even reaching the perfect Blood Refining realm would not be enough.</p><p></p><p>The higher one stands,</p><p>the farther one can see.</p><p>In the eyes of the weak, the small territory of the White Stone Dao is the entire jianghu, but in the eyes of the strong, even an entire prefecture is just trivial.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang wanted to walk the path of conquering the world, so his vision would naturally not be shallow.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p>one must eat food bite by bite,</p><p>and walk the path step by step.</p><p></p><p>For now,</p><p>the main focus should be on breaking through to the perfect Blood Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>On the other side,</p><p>in the Grinding Knife Hall,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not take the matter of the Blood Spirit Sect lightly.</p><p></p><p>Since the battle at the Flowing Cloud Manor, he had a clearer understanding of his own strength.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Sect,</p><p>at most, was on par with the Scarlet Flame Sect.</p><p></p><p>Honestly,</p><p>with Gu Qingfeng's current strength, he was confident that he could destroy the Scarlet Flame Sect.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p>destroying a Scarlet Flame Sect is easy, but the subsequent troubles would be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes,</p><p>this world belongs to the sorcerers.</p><p>If martial artists draw their swords against the sorcerers, they will become enemies of all the sorcerers in the world.</p><p></p><p>This is different from the previous suppression of the Divine Fist Sect.</p><p>Gu Qingfeng attacked the Divine Fist Sect because they had a previous grudge, and his strength was sufficient to make everyone wary.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the previous grudge and Gu Qingfeng's overwhelming strength, the destruction of the Divine Fist Sect would have brought great trouble to the Gu family manor.</p><p></p><p>"In the end,</p><p>it all comes down to strength!"</p><p>"With my current strength, I do not yet have the qualifications to openly draw my sword against the sorcerers, but if my martial arts can make a breakthrough one day, these problems will no longer exist!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's gaze was indifferent.</p><p>The sects of the sorcerers in the world controlled almost all the top-tier secret techniques. Regardless of the reasons, Gu Qingfeng had to take action against these forces.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p>the time is not yet right.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng closed his eyes and began to mobilize his qi and blood power, tempering his flesh and bones, refining himself, and cultivating the Prajna Sutra.</p><p></p><p>Mobilizing the qi and blood!</p><p>Circulating throughout the body!</p><p></p><p>His entire body trembled, the marrow in his bones shook, and the tiny impurities were gradually expelled from the marrow.</p><p></p><p>Repeating this process.</p><p>Gu Qingfeng's cultivation was slowly improving.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and half a year had passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>During this half year,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng spent most of his time cultivating in the Grinding Knife Hall, but through the information panel, he could also know about Gu Yang's current affairs.</p><p></p><p>And,</p><p>from the mouth of the secret guard, he learned about the changes in the current situation in the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>Over the past half year,</p><p>the Martial Emperor Pei Jing had launched a massive military campaign and had completely brought the entire Flowing Cloud Manor under his control.</p><p></p><p>As for taking down the Flowing Cloud Manor...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After the conquest of the Yunfu, the Divine Might Army seemed to have settled down, as if the war had been completely resolved.</p><p></p><p>But those with clear eyes all knew the truth.</p><p></p><p>The so-called peace now was merely a harbinger of the impending storm.</p><p></p><p>Having taken Yunfu.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Might Army also needed to recuperate.</p><p></p><p>Once the recuperation was complete, an overwhelming offensive would surely follow.</p><p></p><p>It was that simple.</p><p></p><p>The situation in the Central Plains was changing unpredictably, becoming increasingly intense. Pei Jing had to seize the opportunity to capture the entire Guangyang Prefecture, then devour Taishan County, and eventually bring the entire Qingzhou under his control.</p><p></p><p>While Yunfu was calm and peaceful, Gu Yang was also secretly amassing his strength.</p><p></p><p>Over the past half year.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had continued to dispatch his covert agents to eliminate various mountain strongholds and bandits, harvesting resources for troop training.</p><p></p><p>Originally.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was still wary of the existence of the Blood Spirit Sect.</p><p></p><p>But after Gu Qingfeng's words, he had completely let go of that concern.</p><p></p><p>Since the Blood Spirit Sect was not a threat, there was no need to worry about it anymore.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that this approach would enrage the Blood Spirit Sect, but over the past half year, the Blood Spirit Sect had seemingly vanished completely, leaving Gu Yang feeling somewhat disappointed, yet also secretly relieved.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng exhaled a breath, and his flesh and blood surged, his entire body crackling like thunderous echoes.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that it will still take some time for the Prajnaparamita Sutra to reach perfection!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Although the Prajnaparamita Sutra had not yet broken through to perfection, the progress in the Scarlet Flame Divine Technique had been quite satisfactory over the past half year.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the breakthrough to the fifth layer four months ago, the Scarlet Flame Divine Technique had been advancing rapidly. In a short period of time, Gu Qingfeng had directly broken through several barriers, reaching the ninth layer of the Scarlet Flame Divine Technique.</p><p></p><p>And after breaking through the ninth layer, Gu Qingfeng finally truly understood that once the Scarlet Flame Divine Technique reached the ninth layer, he would be able to generate true qi on his own and break through to the ranks of the Xiantian Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>The rumored tenth layer would require gradual refinement.</p><p></p><p>After the ninth layer of the Scarlet Flame Divine Technique, Gu Qingfeng's entire body was as fiery and brilliant as the midday sun, with a scorching aura constantly surging through his meridians, giving birth to a subtle power.</p><p></p><p>This power.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Qingfeng's eyes, was the so-called true qi.</p><p></p><p>This true qi, born within, was constantly converging towards the dantian in his lower abdomen.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately.</p><p></p><p>His dantian was not yet open.</p><p></p><p>The true qi continued to assault the dantian barrier, but could not break through it.</p><p></p><p>According to Gu Qingfeng's estimation, only when the true qi had accumulated to a certain degree and completely opened the dantian, would he truly be able to break through to the tenth layer of the Scarlet Flame Divine Technique and become a Xiantian Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>As for how long this would take, Gu Qingfeng could not estimate accurately.</p><p></p><p>Judging from the speed at which this true qi was being born, it would likely take at least several years, or even a decade, to break through to the Xiantian Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng could not help but shake his head.</p><p></p><p>"Refining for ten years, if it could grant the opportunity to break through to the Grandmaster realm, I believe most people would be willing, as Grandmasters are not many in this world, showing how difficult this realm is to attain.</p><p></p><p>However, if I have enough cultivation points, I may not need to wait that long!"</p><p></p><p>Although he said this.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also understood that if he had enough cultivation points, rather than using them to break through to the Xiantian Grandmaster realm, it would be better to first refine his physical body to perfection.</p><p></p><p>The self-generated true qi of a Xiantian Grandmaster may not necessarily be stronger than a perfectly refined physical body.</p><p></p><p>Before reaching the Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>Refining the five viscera and washing the marrow are all part of the process of body refinement.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>If he could perfect his physical body refinement.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng believed that his strength would be far superior to directly breaking through to the Xiantian Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 125</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang left.</p><p></p><p>He was digesting the words that Gu Qingfeng had said earlier.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao in this world has flaws!</p><p>The perfect martial dao!</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was secretly stirred in his heart, but he was only at the Blood Refining stage, so naturally he didn't have much understanding.</p><p></p><p>However, </p><p>he was now trying his best to improve his own strength, and any cultivation resources he could get, he would fully utilize them.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the past half year, Gu Yang had eliminated many sects, and he had obtained a lot of resources from these sects.</p><p></p><p>Aside from secretly training, the remaining resources were more than enough for him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had a premonition.</p><p>At the fastest, in half a year, at the latest in a year, he would be able to break through to the perfect Blood Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p>looking at the current situation,</p><p>even if he reached the perfect Blood Refining realm, it would still be somewhat insufficient.</p><p></p><p>The higher one stands,</p><p>the farther one can see.</p><p>In the eyes of the weak, the small territory of the White Stone Sect is the entire jianghu, but in the eyes of the strong, even an entire prefecture is just trivial.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang wanted to walk the path of conquering the world, so his vision would naturally not be shallow.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p>one must eat food bite by bite.</p><p>The path must also be walked step by step.</p><p></p><p>For now,</p><p>the main focus should be to break through to the perfect Blood Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>On the other side,</p><p>inside the Grinding Sword Hall,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not take the matter of the Blood Spirit Sect to heart.</p><p></p><p>Since the battle at the Flowing Cloud Manor, he had a clearer understanding of his own strength.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Sect,</p><p>at most, was on par with the Scarlet Flame Sect.</p><p></p><p>To be honest,</p><p>with Gu Qingfeng's current strength, he was absolutely confident that he could destroy the Scarlet Flame Sect.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p>destroying a Scarlet Flame Sect is easy, but the subsequent troubles would be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes,</p><p>this world belongs to the sorcerers.</p><p>If a martial artist were to raise his blade against the sorcerers, then he would be making enemies of all the sorcerers in the world.</p><p></p><p>This was different from the previous elimination of the Divine Fist Sect.</p><p>Gu Qingfeng acted against the Divine Fist Sect because the two sides had a long-standing grudge, and then it was his own displayed strength that made the various factions wary.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the previous grudge and Gu Qingfeng's sufficient strength, the elimination of the Divine Fist Sect would have brought great trouble to the Gu family manor.</p><p></p><p>"In the end!"</p><p>"It's a matter of strength!"</p><p>"With my current strength, I still don't have the qualification to openly raise my blade against the sorcerers, but one day, if my martial dao can make a breakthrough, these problems will no longer exist!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's gaze was indifferent.</p><p>The sects of the sorcerers in the world controlled almost all of the top-tier secret manuals, no matter what the reason, Gu Qingfeng had to take action against these forces.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p>the time is not yet ripe.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng closed his eyes and began to mobilize his qi and blood power, tempering his flesh and bones, refining himself, and cultivating the Prajna Sutra.</p><p></p><p>Transporting the qi and blood!</p><p>Circulating throughout the body!</p><p></p><p>His entire body, from the bones to the joints, vibrated, and the marrow inside shook, with the faint impurities being gradually expelled from the marrow.</p><p></p><p>Repeating this process.</p><p>Gu Qingfeng's cultivation was also slowly improving.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and half a year had passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>During this half year,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng spent most of his time cultivating in the Grinding Sword Hall, but through the information panel, he could also know about Gu Yang's current affairs.</p><p></p><p>And,</p><p>from the mouth of the secret guard, he also learned about the changes in the current situation in the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>In the past half year,</p><p>the Martial Emperor Pei Jing had launched a massive military campaign, and he had already brought the entire Flowing Cloud Manor under his control.</p><p></p><p>And in conquering the Flowing Cloud Manor...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After the capture of the Yunfu, the Shenwu Army seemed to have settled down, as if the war had been completely resolved.</p><p></p><p>But those with clear eyes all knew the truth.</p><p></p><p>The so-called peace now was merely a harbinger of the impending storm.</p><p></p><p>Having taken Liuyun Prefecture,</p><p></p><p>The Shenwu Army also needed to regroup and recuperate.</p><p></p><p>Once the regrouping was complete, an overwhelming offensive was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>It was simple.</p><p></p><p>The situation in the Central Plains was constantly changing and becoming increasingly intense. Pei Jing had to seize the opportunity to take the entire Guangyang Prefecture, then devour Taishan Commandery, and eventually bring the entire Qingzhou under his control.</p><p></p><p>While Liuyun Prefecture was calm and peaceful, Gu Yang was also secretly accumulating his strength.</p><p></p><p>Over the past half year,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had continued to dispatch his covert agents to eliminate various mountain strongholds and bandits, harvesting resources for troop training.</p><p></p><p>Originally,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was still wary of the existence of the Xuelingsect.</p><p></p><p>But after Gu Qingfeng's words, he had completely let go of his concerns.</p><p></p><p>Since the Xuelingsect was not a threat, there was no need to worry about it anymore.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that this approach would enrage the Xuelingsect, but over the past half year, the Xuelingsect had seemingly vanished completely, leaving Gu Yang feeling somewhat disappointed, yet also secretly relieved.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng let out a breath, and his physical body's qi and blood surged, his entire body's muscles and bones cracking and rumbling like thunderous echoes.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that it will still take some time for the Banruo True Scriptures to be perfected!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Although the Banruo True Scriptures had not yet reached complete mastery, the progress in the Crimson Flame Divine Skill had been quite satisfactory over the past half year.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the breakthrough to the fifth layer four months ago, the Crimson Flame Divine Skill had been advancing rapidly. In a short period of time, Gu Qingfeng had directly broken through several barriers, reaching the ninth layer of the Crimson Flame Divine Skill.</p><p></p><p>And after breaking through the ninth layer, Gu Qingfeng finally truly understood that once the Crimson Flame Divine Skill reached the ninth layer, he would be able to directly generate true qi, breaking through to the ranks of the Xiantian Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>The rumored tenth layer would require gradual refinement.</p><p></p><p>After the ninth layer of the Crimson Flame Divine Skill, Gu Qingfeng's entire body's qi and blood burned fiercely like fire, shining brilliantly like the midday sun, and his meridians were constantly filled with a scorching aura, with a subtle power constantly being born within.</p><p></p><p>This power,</p><p></p><p>In Gu Qingfeng's eyes, was the so-called true qi.</p><p></p><p>This true qi that was being born kept converging towards the dantian in his lower abdomen.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately,</p><p></p><p>His dantian was not yet open.</p><p></p><p>These true qi kept colliding with the dantian barrier, unable to break through.</p><p></p><p>According to Gu Qingfeng's estimation, only when the true qi had accumulated to a certain degree and completely opened the dantian, would he truly step into the tenth layer of the Crimson Flame Divine Skill and break through to become a Xiantian Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>As for how long this would take, Gu Qingfeng could not estimate.</p><p></p><p>After all, judging from the speed at which this true qi was being born, it would take at least several years, or even a decade, before he could possibly break through to the Xiantian Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng couldn't help but shake his head.</p><p></p><p>"Refining for ten years, if it can be exchanged for a chance to break through to the Grandmaster realm, I believe most people would be willing, after all, Grandmasters are not many in the world, which shows how difficult this realm is to break through.</p><p></p><p>However, if I have enough cultivation points, I don't have to wait that long!"</p><p></p><p>Although he said so,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also understood that if he had enough cultivation points, rather than using them to break through to the Xiantian Grandmaster realm, it would be better to first refine his physical body to perfection.</p><p></p><p>The self-generated true qi of the Xiantian Grandmaster may not necessarily be stronger than a perfectly refined physical body.</p><p></p><p>Before reaching the Grandmaster realm,</p><p></p><p>Refining the five viscera and washing the marrow and bones, etc., were all part of the process of refining the physical body.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>If he could refine his physical body to perfection,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng believed that his strength would be far greater than directly breaking through to the Xiantian Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

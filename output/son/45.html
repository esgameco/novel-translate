        <h1>Chapter 45</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This was a bountiful reward that Gu Qingfeng had never possessed before.</p><p></p><p>Immediately.</p><p></p><p>He did not hesitate at all, and directly piled all these promotion points onto the Hundred Tempering Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>Consume one promotion point.</p><p>The Hundred Tempering Golden Body reached the first major success! Consume one promotion point.</p><p>The Hundred Tempering Golden Body reached the first level of perfection! Consume two promotion points.</p><p>The Hundred Tempering Golden Body entered the second level! ......</p><p>Consume five promotion points.</p><p>The Hundred Tempering Golden Body entered the third level! ......</p><p></p><p>When the Hundred Tempering Golden Body stepped into the third level, Gu Qingfeng's whole body trembled, and a powerful blood force surged forth, and the perfect iron bones on his body became even more profound.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not advance to the Copper Bone rank, he seemed to be even stronger than the Copper Bone.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards.</p><p>Gu Qingfeng continued to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Copper Bone perfected!</p><p>Silver Bone perfected!</p><p>Gold Bone perfected!</p><p>......</p><p></p><p>In just a short moment.</p><p>Gu Qingfeng had cultivated the Hundred Tempering Golden Body to perfection.</p><p></p><p>If Si Tian were here, he would definitely be greatly shocked.</p><p>After all, the Hundred Tempering Golden Body is a military martial art, and many people have practiced it for decades, but they still cannot cultivate it to perfection. Now Gu Qingfeng has perfected the Golden Body in just a moment, how could it not shock people.</p><p></p><p>"The whole body has perfect Gold Bones!"</p><p>"So this is the power of the Bone Refining Realm perfected -"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng clenched his fists, this power is more than twice as strong as his previous breakthrough.</p><p>If it were his Bone Refining initial stage self here, he would be confident in killing with a single punch.</p><p></p><p>This.</p><p>Is the power of the perfected Bone Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover.</p><p>When the Hundred Tempering Golden Body broke through the second level, there was a reminder that the Golden Body is indestructible.</p><p>Now that the Hundred Tempering Golden Body has broken through the third level of perfection, Gu Qingfeng has cultivated the indestructibility of the Golden Body to an extremely high level.</p><p></p><p>Now, </p><p>even ordinary Bone Refining martial artists do not have the qualifications to break through his defenses.</p><p></p><p>"According to the Martial Dao Classics, when a person's Gold Bones are perfected, even if the body dies for hundreds of years, the bones will not decay and will still maintain the brilliant Gold Bones!"</p><p>"If you go further, it would be the Marrow Cleansing Realm -"</p><p></p><p>To break through the Marrow Cleansing Realm, one must have an excellent martial art.</p><p>Gu Qingfeng does not have an excellent martial art at the moment, so the only way to break through the Marrow Cleansing Realm is to break the limit of his martial art.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p>Gu Qingfeng communicated with the Hundred Tempering Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>Instantly.</p><p>Information appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>To break the limit of the Hundred Tempering Golden Body,</p><p>it requires 20 promotion points.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes were determined, without any hesitation, he directly consumed all the remaining 20 promotion points.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p>The Hundred Tempering Golden Body broke through its limit.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng only felt his bones trembling, and the impurities in the marrow were all expelled, the surging and mighty blood qi erupted with an extremely powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>"Crackle!"</p><p>Gu Qingfeng's whole body bones cracked, and now his flesh and blood have surged, completely incomparable to the previous Bone Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Blood like mercury!"</p><p>"Bone marrow like frost!"</p><p>"This is the Marrow Cleansing Realm -"</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng  Age: 36/180  Realm: Initial Marrow Cleansing</p><p></p><p>Martial Arts: Gu Family Fist (Unbreakable Level 1), Iron Body Technique (Iron Body Level 1), Big Slab Throwing Hand (Minor Success), Iron Leg Technique (Perfected), Forged Iron Finger (Minor Success), Scorching Sun Divine Palm (Ninth Level Perfected, Scorching Palm Qi Level 4), Heaven Thunder Sword Technique (Beginner), Hundred Tempering Golden Body (Golden Body Indestructible Level 9), </p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Seven Kill Blade Technique (Not Yet Mastered) Upgrade Points: 0...</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng glanced at his information panel and saw that his lifespan had already broken through to 180 years.</p><p></p><p>That is to say,</p><p></p><p>Even if he had no further breakthroughs in the future, he could still live safely and steadily to the age of 180.</p><p></p><p>At such an age, he could already be considered long-lived, but to speak of immortality, there was still a long way to go.</p><p></p><p>But regardless of how one looks at it,</p><p></p><p>With the Hundred Tempering Golden Body breakthrough,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng could feel that the Ninth-Grade Golden Body was much more powerful than the Eighth-Grade Golden Body. Given his current situation, only cultivators who had forged Golden Bones would be able to break through his own defenses.</p><p></p><p>Those below the level of Golden Bones,</p><p></p><p>Posed no threat to him whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>"The strength of the Marrow Cleansing Realm is dozens of times greater than the Bone Refining Realm. The experts of such a realm, I imagine, would be among the mightiest in the entire world!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng mused inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Dao Classics recorded that there were Grandmaster experts in the world, but below the Grandmasters were the Organ Refiners, and below the Organ Refiners were the Marrow Cleansers.</p><p></p><p>The White Stone Dao's strongest expert back then was merely at the Perfected Blood Refining Realm, and although the White Stone Dao's strength was not considered powerful, it was still a microcosm of the world.</p><p></p><p>From this, it can be seen,</p><p></p><p>That to be able to step into the Marrow Cleansing Realm, one would already be quite formidable.</p><p></p><p>Having reached this level of cultivation, Gu Qingfeng could finally be considered to have the capital to establish himself in this world.</p><p></p><p>"However, if I want to advance further, I will still need an exceptional martial art. Otherwise, the upgrade points required to break through the limits of a top-grade martial art are truly too high!"</p><p></p><p>The first breakthrough required 20 upgrade points, and the second breakthrough would require 40 points.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng only needed about 30 upgrade points to cultivate the Hundred Tempering Golden Body to perfection.</p><p></p><p>This shows,</p><p></p><p>How high the requirements are for martial art breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>It is best not to use upgrade points to break through the limits until the very last moment, but rather to collect martial arts of the corresponding level. This way, a lot of consumption can be saved.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>High-level martial arts are not something that can be easily obtained.</p><p></p><p>The major sects and aristocratic families all tightly guard the top-tier martial arts, and for others to acquire them is no simple task.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng dispelled the distracting thoughts in his mind and let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>The surging qi and blood within him that had just broken through had now gradually settled down.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang also arrived.</p><p></p><p>He was currently full of vigor, and his smile was difficult to conceal.</p><p></p><p>"Father, I have broken through to the Blood Refining Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, to be able to break through to the Blood Refining Realm at your age, you may have the hope of advancing further in the future. However, do not be arrogant and complacent, for there is always someone better out there."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng first nodded approvingly, then solemnly warned.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression showed a hint of discontent.</p><p></p><p>"I understand the principle of there being someone better out there. But in this White Stone Dao, those who can enter the Blood Refining Realm are not many. Father has provided me with Blood Refining Elixirs to build a solid foundation, and my current strength is already on par with many mid-level Blood Refiners.</p><p></p><p>Given some more time, I believe I can easily match the late-stage Blood Refiners.</p><p></p><p>In the entire White Stone Dao, aside from Father, I don't think there is anyone who can be my opponent!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing his attitude, Gu Qingfeng's gaze slightly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>"You think you are already very strong?"</p><p></p><p>"Although I'm not as strong as Father, I am more than enough to surpass the others."</p><p></p><p>"Alright then, since you feel that way, let your father test your strength. Use all your techniques, and if you can even injure me slightly, I will consider you the winner.</p><p></p><p>Whatever request you make, your father will agree to it."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's voice was calm, without any emotional fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

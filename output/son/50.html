        <h1>Chapter 50</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, what is the purpose of your visit to the Gu family?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng released his palm and asked coldly again.</p><p></p><p>This time.</p><p></p><p>Xue Wang did not dare to waste words or threaten the other party, because he found that the person in front of him was truly not afraid of the Qingyang Sect, and if he continued to insist, the one who would suffer would be himself.</p><p></p><p>"The Qin family was destroyed, and the Sect Master learned that the White Stone Dao was in charge of the Gu family, so he sent me to the Gu family to prepare three thousand young boys and girls to be sent to the Qingyang Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Three thousand young boys and girls!?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want three thousand young boys and girls for?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know - Ah!! I'll tell! I'll tell!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Xue Wang shook his head, he felt a piercing pain in his arm again, causing his face to suddenly twist and let out a miserable scream.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was cold and gloomy, gradually crushing the other party's bones.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you are still not honest enough, treating my previous words as mere wind. I hope there will be no more concealment from now on."</p><p></p><p>With that said.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>Xue Wang's face was deathly pale, his whole body already soaked in sweat and blood.</p><p></p><p>In his weak voice, he was now filled with fear of Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Gu Qingfeng to ask again, Xue Wang hurriedly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch, the Patriarch needs three thousand young boys and girls to cultivate!"</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch, who is the Patriarch of your Qingyang Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Xue Wang said, "The Patriarch is the powerful figure who founded the Qingyang Sect in the past. He calls himself the Qingyang Patriarch, and the rest I am not sure about."</p><p></p><p>Qingyang Patriarch!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this name.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression changed slightly, and his gaze towards Xue Wang was filled with coldness.</p><p></p><p>"Your Qingyang Sect has existed for hundreds of years, and ordinary Refining Bone realm cultivators only live for over a hundred years, even Refining Essence cultivators only live for about two hundred years. Could it be that your Qingyang Sect's Patriarch is a Qi and Blood Grandmaster?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had some knowledge about the origins of the Qingyang Sect.</p><p></p><p>The sect has had a foundation in Guangyang Prefecture for hundreds of years and is considered a major force there.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>To say that the Qingyang Sect has a Qi and Blood Grandmaster as its leader, Gu Qingfeng absolutely does not believe it.</p><p></p><p>If the Qingyang Sect really had such a powerful expert, how could it be confined to Guangyang Prefecture? It should be able to rise to the top of the entire Taishan Prefecture, or even the entire Qingyun State, not just dominating Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not lying, the Qingyang Patriarch is not a Qi and Blood Grandmaster, but he has abandoned the martial dao and cultivated demonic arts, becoming a Sorcerer.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, all the forces under the Qingyang Sect have been providing a certain number of young boys and girls every year to assist his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely because of this that the Qingyang Patriarch has been able to live for hundreds of years without dying!"</p><p></p><p>Afraid that Gu Qingfeng would not believe him, Xue Wang revealed everything he knew.</p><p></p><p>Sorcerer!</p><p></p><p>This was the second time Gu Qingfeng heard this term.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect.</p><p></p><p>The Qingyang Patriarch was actually a Sorcerer.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating demonic arts.</p><p></p><p>Becoming a Sorcerer.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he could live for so long.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes grew cold: "The Qingyang Patriarch cultivates by sacrificing living people. How is this any different from demonic cultivators? Doesn't the imperial court turn a blind eye to this?"</p><p></p><p>"Sorcerers and demonic cultivators are difficult for the common people to encounter, but for the major sects and families, the existence of demonic cultivators and Sorcerers is no secret.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao has its limits, no matter how talented one is, they can only achieve the realm of a Transcendent Grandmaster in about three hundred years, and a Qi and Blood Grandmaster in about five hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Only by cultivating demonic arts and becoming a Sorcerer can one truly transcend the mundane, and only such existences have the hope of glimpsing..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Eternal life is possible!" <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div> "The common people of the world are like livestock, and even if you slaughter countless numbers of them, it is of no consequence. Does the Gu Family Head really think the court is unaware of such matters?"</p><p></p><p>"But that is not the case."</p><p></p><p>"The court has the Bureau of Exorcism, which nurtures many sorcerers, and the number of people who die at the hands of these sorcerers is even greater."</p><p></p><p>"How many people does my Qingyang Sect kill in a year? The court would not care, and not to mention the Bureau of Exorcism, there are many major sects and families that kill even more people than my Qingyang Sect.</p><p></p><p>As long as we don't completely wipe out the common people, the missing population will replenish itself in a few years."</p><p></p><p>Xue Wang's face was filled with mockery and disdain as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>This disdain was not directed at Gu Qingfeng, but rather at the common people of the world, who were no different than livestock in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was silent for a moment, then asked, "You are not a sorcerer, are you?"</p><p></p><p>"It is not easy to become a sorcerer, and suppressing evil spirits is fraught with great risk. Only those who have made great contributions to the sect have the qualifications to refine evil spirits into their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, refining evil spirits into one's body does not always succeed. In recent years, the Qingyang Sect has only had the Patriarch succeed in this endeavor.</p><p></p><p>But regardless, as long as one person can succeed, it proves that this path is viable."</p><p></p><p>Xue Wang shook his head and continued, "The Gu Family Head's cultivation is extraordinary, and at such a young age, he must have the potential to reach the level of refining impurities, and even the realm of Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>However, even if he reaches such realms, he will still turn to dust hundreds of years later.</p><p></p><p>Only by refining evil spirits into one's body can one truly achieve eternal life."</p><p></p><p>"But to refine evil spirits into one's body, one must possess the corresponding secret techniques. As long as the Gu Family Head is willing to join the Qingyang Sect, I believe it will not be a problem for the Patriarch to obtain the secret techniques for refining evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the Gu Family Head's strength is formidable, so the chances of successfully refining evil spirits are extremely high."</p><p></p><p>Until this moment, Xue Wang had not forgotten to try to recruit Gu Qingfeng to the Qingyang Sect.</p><p></p><p>There was no other choice.</p><p></p><p>If he could not bring Gu Qingfeng into the Qingyang Sect's camp, it would be difficult for him to leave the dungeon alive.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not respond, but continued to ask, "How powerful is the Qingyang Patriarch?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Wang said, "The Patriarch's strength is unfathomable. He reached the level of Golden Bone Perfection hundreds of years ago."</p><p></p><p>"Ten years ago, a powerful cultivator who had just entered the Washing Marrow Realm attacked the Qingyang Sect. In the end, the Patriarch personally stepped forward and engaged in a fierce battle, ultimately suppressing that Washing Marrow Realm expert."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Qingfeng had an idea.</p><p></p><p>Although the Qingyang Patriarch had reached the level of Golden Bone Perfection hundreds of years ago, after refining evil spirits and becoming a sorcerer, his martial arts cultivation would have stagnated.</p><p></p><p>According to Xue Wang's description, ten years ago, the Qingyang Patriarch fought a fierce battle with a Washing Marrow Realm expert and managed to suppress him.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the Qingyang Patriarch's strength was around the Washing Marrow Realm level, but not significantly stronger than an ordinary Washing Marrow Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>With his current foundation, the probability of defeating the Patriarch in a life-and-death battle would not be low.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Gu Qingfeng had already formed a plan.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he continued to inquire about other matters regarding the Qingyang Sect, and Xue Wang answered them one by one.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Xue Wang had realized something.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Gu Qingfeng with a face full of unwillingness.</p><p></p><p>"Why must the Gu Family Head be an enemy of the Qingyang Sect?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

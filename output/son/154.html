        <h1>Chapter 154</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The many senior elders, as well as the Zhuo family patriarch Zhuo Xuankong, had all gathered together.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianyang Sword Sect has sent a message, wanting our Zhuo family to cooperate with them to annihilate the Gu Family Manor. What are your thoughts on this?" </p><p></p><p>Zhuo Xuankong said slowly.</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, </p><p></p><p>many of the Zhuo family elders had varying expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Then, </p><p></p><p>someone spoke up: "The Tianyang Sword Sect is an immortal sect, and Elder Gu is a top expert in the world. Even though Gu Qingfeng is a grand master, he would have no chance against Elder Gu."</p><p></p><p>"Once the Tianyang Sword Sect arrives, the Gu Family Manor will surely collapse. Not to mention the Guangyang King, even the Hegemon Sword Gu Qingfeng may not be able to survive."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, judging from the Guangyang King's ways, he has quite a negative opinion towards our occult forces."</p><p></p><p>"The Crimson Flame Sect had already submitted, but was still annihilated by the Guangyang Army. Now, although he has not made a move against our Zhuo family, who can guarantee that we won't become the second Crimson Flame Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, this elder believes that agreeing to the Tianyang Sword Sect's request will not harm our Zhuo family. At the same time, we can also use this opportunity to get in touch with the Tianyang Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>A thousand-year-old family! An immortal sect! The gap between the two is simply immeasurable. </p><p></p><p>The strongest of the Zhuo family are only at the late Spiritual Monarch realm, but in the Tianyang Sword Sect, the Spiritual Monarch realm is considered average. Only those who have reached the Fusion Spirit realm have the qualifications to join the upper echelons.</p><p></p><p>Like the Tianyang Sect Master Elder Gu, he is a terrifying existence at the Transformation realm.</p><p></p><p>This shows just how great the gap is between the Zhuo family and the Tianyang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Tianyang Sword Sect spares a little bit of their resources, it would be enough to make the Zhuo family extremely wealthy.</p><p></p><p>The other elders, upon hearing this, also nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Guangyang King's strength, which is not enough to contend with the Tianyang Sword Sect. Even if the two were evenly matched, the Zhuo family would still be more inclined towards the Tianyang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>The reason is simple.</p><p></p><p>The Guangyang King's backing is the Gu Family Manor, which is a purely martial arts force.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Tianyang Sword Sect, they belong to the same occult faction as the Zhuo family.</p><p></p><p>After thousands of years of evolution, there is already a huge divide between the occult practitioners and the martial artists. The two sides are on completely different levels.</p><p></p><p>If the Zhuo family had to choose, the Tianyang Sword Sect would be their first choice.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the main seat, Zhuo Xuankong's mouth curled into a cold smile upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>He had quite a lot of dissatisfaction towards the Guangyang King and the Gu Family Manor behind him.</p><p></p><p>It's simple.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Gu Yang took control of the Guangyang Prefecture, he has ordered various families and sects to no longer conduct blood sacrifices of the common people.</p><p></p><p>This approach has naturally made many families and sects unhappy.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p></p><p>the cultivation of occult practitioners is inseparable from the blood and essence of living beings.</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p></p><p>in the eyes of occult practitioners, the common people are no different from the livestock they raise.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's order is essentially a means to suppress the development of these families and sects.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Gu Yang's power was too great, so Zhuo Xuankong, despite his dissatisfaction, could only endure it.</p><p></p><p>But now it's different.</p><p></p><p>The Tianyang Sword Sect has stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>So the Zhuo family must seize this opportunity to directly break Gu Yang's rule.</p><p></p><p>"Since everyone agrees, then let's do as the Tianyang Sword Sect suggests. Coincidentally, I am about to reach the peak of the Spiritual Monarch realm. Sacrificing the people of a city should not be a problem for me to take that crucial step!"</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Xuankong directly made the decision.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the Guangyang Prefecture was under the control of the imperial court, so even though the Zhuo family had a strong presence there, it was not so easy for them to openly conduct a mass blood sacrifice.</p><p></p><p>At least,</p><p></p><p>until now.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Si over there would not easily agree.</p><p></p><p>Later on.</p><p></p><p>When the Warrior King Pei Jing took control of Guangyang Prefecture, Zhuo Xuankong did not dare to make any moves.</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing himself is not terrifying.</p><p></p><p>What's terrifying is the Tian Yang Sword Sect behind Pei Jing. If the Zhuo family were to sacrifice the citizens of a city under Pei Jing's watch, how would that be any different from snatching food from a tiger's mouth?</p><p></p><p>Wait until later.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Yang took charge of Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>He had explicitly forbidden it, leaving Zhuo Xuankong helpless.</p><p></p><p>But now it's different.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Yang Sword Sect has given the order beforehand, and Guangyang Prefecture is still under Gu Yang's control, so the Zhuo family can seize this opportunity to directly sacrifice the citizens of a city, believing that the Tian Yang Sword Sect won't say much afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Zhuo Xuankong's words, many Zhuo family elders had a trace of bloodthirsty crimson flash in their eyes, and their expressions became greedy.</p><p></p><p>Sacrifice the citizens of a city! Even if Zhuo Xuankong has to take the lion's share, they can take a sip of the soup.</p><p></p><p>The citizens of a city, at least two or even more hundred thousand people.</p><p></p><p>Such a large number of innocent lives sacrificed, even just taking a sip of the soup, can greatly advance their own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In this world, strength is everything.</p><p></p><p>If they can make a breakthrough, not to mention other things, their status within the Zhuo family alone can rise several notches.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Just as the many Zhuo family elders were fantasizing about the benefits of sacrificing the citizens of a city, a detached voice suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Wanting to sacrifice the citizens of a city, I'm afraid the Zhuo family no longer has that opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, the Zhuo family members all changed expression.</p><p></p><p>"Who!"</p><p></p><p>The moment the words fell, they saw a young man had appeared in the hall, they knew not when.</p><p></p><p>The other party was dressed in black, his expression cold and indifferent, emanating an aura of deathly stillness.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Zhuo family members' words, the young man spoke a few words.</p><p></p><p>"Vice Commander Gu Er of the Guangyang King's Shadow Guards, ordered to eliminate the Zhuo family!"</p><p></p><p>Shadow Guards!</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, the Zhuo family members' expressions changed greatly again.</p><p></p><p>The existence of the Shadow Guards is no longer a secret.</p><p></p><p>Because Gu Yang was able to take over Guangyang Prefecture so quickly, the Shadow Guards have played a huge role in it.</p><p></p><p>There is even news that the powerful experts who eliminated the Crimson Flame Sect came from the Shadow Guards.</p><p></p><p>Now.</p><p></p><p>A Shadow Guards Vice Commander appearing, how could it not shock the Zhuo family?</p><p></p><p>Howeverâ€”</p><p></p><p>Before the Zhuo family members could react, they saw Gu Er's palm move, his waist sword suddenly unsheathed, emanating a towering killing intent that made the entire hall's temperature drop sharply.</p><p></p><p>When the sword light dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The hall fell into a brief silence, then they saw several Zhuo family elders' bodies torn to pieces, flesh and blood flying, and some of the corpses even had evil spirits directly reviving from them.</p><p></p><p>It was only at this moment that the other Zhuo family members snapped out of the sudden situation.</p><p></p><p>"Transcendent Realm Master!!"</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Xuankong's face was greatly alarmed, his gaze towards Gu Er filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>In the next breath.</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Xuankong turned and ran.</p><p></p><p>Facing a Transcendent Realm Master, and judging from that sword strike, Gu Er's strength was far from a ordinary Transcendent Realm Master.</p><p></p><p>Although it is said that peak Spirit Apostle realm cultivators can be on par with Transcendent Realm Masters, that is only on par with newly advanced Transcendent Realm Masters.</p><p></p><p>Moreover.</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Xuankong was only one step away from the peak of the Spirit Apostle realm.</p><p></p><p>But that one step difference is already an immense gap.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter End)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's time to leave Linxian County!" </p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the Blood Refining Realm, Gu Qingfeng's five senses had become much more acute. The entire Linxian County gave him a strong sense of discomfort - the blood mist that permeated the sky was filled with eerie and ominous energy.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, Linxian County had become a land of death.</p><p></p><p>To remain here would be a dead end.</p><p></p><p>However, before leaving Linxian County, Gu Qingfeng consolidated his cultivation realm further and consumed the remaining three Blood Refining Elixirs to refine them.</p><p></p><p>After his cultivation breakthrough, the restrictions on him consuming Blood Refining Elixirs had lessened considerably. </p><p></p><p>The three Blood Refining Elixirs were completely refined within a single day.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Refining Elixirs were truly the elixirs of cultivators in the Blood Refining Realm. As the three elixirs were refined, Gu Qingfeng felt his inner qi and blood grow even more robust. If he had access to a large quantity of Blood Refining Elixirs, his breakthrough to the mid-stage of the Blood Refining Realm would likely be effortless.</p><p></p><p>In cultivating the martial way, there are two key aspects - one is the martial arts, and the other is medicinal resources like elixirs. The former requires self-tempering of the physical body through specific methods, as exemplified by arts like the Crushing Mountain Fist and Iron Body Technique. If one lacks the corresponding martial arts, they can only rely on gradual self-exploration.</p><p></p><p>The other aspect is elixirs. If one lacks the martial arts to refine their body, as long as they have sufficient elixirs, breakthroughs can be easily achieved.</p><p></p><p>On the second day after breaking through to the Blood Refining Realm, Gu Qingfeng finally decided to leave Linxian County. He took Gu Yang with him and headed towards the city gates.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they arrived at the city gates, where they found city guards stationed there. Gu Qingfeng's brow furrowed, but he did not stop in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the guards noticed their presence.</p><p></p><p>"The County Magistrate has ordered that no one is to leave Linxian County without permission!" the lead middle-aged guard said in a cold voice.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not respond, but looked at the other guards, seeing that each of them had their hands unconsciously gripping the hilts of their sabers, their expressions cold and fierce, as if they would attack at the slightest provocation.</p><p></p><p>Just as the middle-aged guard was about to reprimand him again, Gu Qingfeng suddenly released his grip on Gu Yang's hand and took a swift step forward, slamming his shoulder into the guard's chest.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>With Gu Qingfeng's iron-hard physique and immense strength, the guard's chest caved in, and he was sent flying like a broken weed, already dead before he hit the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Audacious!" </p><p>"Kill him!"</p><p></p><p>The remaining guards hurriedly drew their sabers, intent on slaying Gu Qingfeng. </p><p></p><p>However, before they could attack, Gu Qingfeng made his move first. His right fist shot out like a yellow dragon, and with a thunderous impact, it smashed into the face of one of the guards, shattering his head like a watermelon.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the attacks from the other guards arrived. Their gleaming sabers descended with fierce winds, their expressions savage, as if they could already see Gu Qingfeng being sliced to bloody pulp.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>When the long blade came down, the expected splatter of blood did not occur. The blade was like striking against a hard rock, with a powerful rebound force that even chipped the blade in several places.</p><p></p><p>"What!" </p><p></p><p>The few constables and officials were greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng then turned around, grabbing the blade with his right hand and forcefully clenching it, causing the forged steel blade to shatter instantly. He then casually flung the shards of blade, piercing through the bodies of several constables.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>The excruciating pain made them cry out in agonized screams.</p><p></p><p>But when they saw Gu Qingfeng's figure, their previous arrogance vanished, and they pleaded for mercy with panicked expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Spare us! Spare our lives!!!"</p><p></p><p>"Let us goâ€”"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was cold and ruthless. With one punch after another, he completely killed all the constables amidst their cries for mercy.</p><p></p><p>This battle had begun abruptly and ended quickly. In just a few breaths, all the constables had been slain.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang stood there dumbfounded, staring at the scene of bloodied corpses on the ground, his young face frozen, unsure if it was out of fear or something else.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng approached him, the pungent smell of blood hit him, finally snapping Gu Yang out of his daze.</p><p></p><p>"Father..."</p><p></p><p>"Now that the bloody mist has spread, they have deliberately sealed the city gates, intending for us to die here. This world is like this - if you don't kill, others will kill you. In this chaotic era, mercy will only harm oneself.</p><p></p><p>Today, I'm giving you your first lesson. If you don't need to use your hands, then so be it. But once you do, you must cut the root and eliminate any future threats!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was grave, and the aura of bloodlust after the killings had added an extra layer of intensity to him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang paused for a moment, then looked at the corpses on the ground again, finally nodding firmly, "I understand, son will remember this!"</p><p></p><p>"Good." </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng observed Gu Yang's reaction, satisfied that the latter did not show much fear towards the deaths. </p><p></p><p>What he had feared the most was Gu Yang being afraid of killing, having a gentle nature. In a peaceful era, such a temperament would be fine. But in the current chaotic world, it would only harm himself.</p><p></p><p>In the two decades he had lived, Gu Qingfeng had witnessed countless killings. Although he had not truly killed anyone before, he had long understood the nature of this turbulent world.</p><p></p><p>Now, when he actually killed, Gu Qingfeng did not feel much inner turmoil. In fact, there was even a subtle sense of excitement that he couldn't quite explain.</p><p></p><p>Yes, excitement.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not feel much rejection towards this change within himself. He glanced at the bodies of the constables on the ground. The commotion here was not small, and the officials would likely arrive soon.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he had no intention of lingering further. He directly took Gu Yang's hand and headed towards the bloody mist outside the city.</p><p></p><p>Soon after Gu Qingfeng and Gu Yang left, the other hidden civilians gradually emerged.</p><p></p><p>"What a ruthless person, daring to kill the officials!"</p><p></p><p>"That man looks familiar, I think he's one of the instructors at the Golden Bull Martial Arts Hall."</p><p></p><p>"He's courting death! Not only did he kill people, but he's also daring to leave the city?"</p><p></p><p>Many civilians were shocked by the scene they had just witnessed. Since Gu Qingfeng had been living in the county for years, some recognized him.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the words "Golden Bull Martial Arts Hall", some of the people's expressions relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, they looked at the severed limbs and corpses on the ground with obvious fear, but when they glanced towards the bloody mist outside the city gates, their gazes became uncertain, as if they were pondering something.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

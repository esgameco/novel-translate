        <h1>Chapter 110</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Inside the Whetstone Hall, Gu Qingfeng looked at his attribute panel and directly used the upgrade points to make a breakthrough in the Crimson Flame Divine Art.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Crimson Flame Divine Art Fourth Layer Mastery! Crimson Flame Divine Art Fourth Layer Perfection! Crimson Flame Divine Art Fourth Layer Completion!...</p><p></p><p>After cultivating the Crimson Flame Divine Art to the Fourth Layer Completion, Gu Qingfeng no longer used the upgrade points to forcefully improve it.</p><p></p><p>This is because the first four layers of the Crimson Flame Divine Art correspond to refining the skin and washing the marrow, so each layer requires four upgrades to break through to the next.</p><p></p><p>However, starting from the Fifth Layer,</p><p>the Crimson Flame Divine Art is aimed at the Refining Viscera realm.</p><p>The five layers correspond to the five viscera.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, for martial artists, refining the five viscera is often difficult to enter, but once successful, it becomes much easier.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, since Gu Qingfeng had already reached the Refining Viscera Fifth Realm, it would be more practical for him to slowly cultivate the Crimson Flame Divine Art by himself, rather than wasting the upgrade points to push it up.</p><p></p><p>Do not be fooled by the fact that Gu Qingfeng spent two years just to barely cultivate the Crimson Flame Divine Art to the Fourth Layer.</p><p></p><p>However, for the subsequent five layers,</p><p>the time he needed was greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the remaining 82 upgrade points in his attribute panel, Gu Qingfeng also cultivated two top-grade martial arts.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Mysterious Heart Saint Body (Third Layer Completion, Flesh and Bone Level 2) Great Golden Vajra Body (Third Layer Completion, Flesh and Bone Level 2)</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>For these two top-grade martial arts, Gu Qingfeng raised them to the Completion level in one breath.</p><p></p><p>The moment the two martial arts reached Completion, Gu Qingfeng's 365 golden bones violently trembled, and the surging blood qi merged into the golden bones, expelling the impurities bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>In less than a moment,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng's skin surface was already covered with a layer of dirt.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his blood qi pulsing, the dirt covering his body was instantly dispersed.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked inward at his own body.</p><p></p><p>He found that his entire skeleton had somehow turned into a translucent jade-like color.</p><p></p><p>"Jade Bones throughout the body!"</p><p>"This is the realm of Perfect Bone Refinement!!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes shone with brilliance.</p><p></p><p>Little did the jianghu know that the golden bones cultivated through the Completion of Bone Refinement were not the true limit.</p><p></p><p>Jade Bones throughout the body!</p><p>This is the perfect state of Bone Refinement.</p><p></p><p>With a body of Jade Bones,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng felt the overwhelming power within him, which had increased by at least 30% compared to before refining the Jade Bones.</p><p></p><p>This...</p><p>is the terrifying power of Perfect Bone Refinement.</p><p></p><p>Of course, besides the increase in strength,</p><p>the greatest change was Gu Qingfeng's lifespan.</p><p></p><p>By cultivating Perfect Bone Refinement, his lifespan had increased by another 300 years on top of the original.</p><p></p><p>Now, Gu Qingfeng had a lifespan of 800 years.</p><p></p><p>Just as he had expected, with this condition, achieving Perfect Marrow Cleansing and Perfect Viscera Refinement to break through the thousand-year lifespan would be an easy task.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the remaining 18 upgrade points and did not continue using them.</p><p></p><p>The 18 upgrade points did not have much use for the moment, and he would wait to accumulate more before considering further improvements.</p><p></p><p>"Additionally--"</p><p>"The number of supreme martial arts is somewhat lacking."</p><p>"If I want to achieve Perfect Marrow Cleansing, I will need to find some supreme martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>Although the top-grade martial arts could match the supreme martial arts after being broken through,</p><p>the upgrade points required for martial arts breakthroughs were simply too many and too demanding.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There were many.</p><p></p><p>Even the advancement points required to break through the limits of a top-grade martial art were at least equivalent to advancing one realm in the Refining Impurity stage.</p><p></p><p>More importantly,</p><p></p><p>The advancement in breaking through the limits of a martial art is a gradual process.</p><p></p><p>For example, to break through the initial stage of the Marrow Cleansing realm in a top-grade martial art, it requires 20 advancement points, but the middle stage requires 40 points, the advanced stage 60 points, and the complete Marrow Cleansing realm requires 80 points.</p><p></p><p>In this way,</p><p></p><p>To advance a top-grade martial art from the initial to the complete Marrow Cleansing realm, a total of 200 advancement points are needed.</p><p></p><p>It can be seen,</p><p></p><p>The requirements for breaking through the limits of a martial art are extremely high.</p><p></p><p>Even with the abundant advancement points Gu Qingfeng had, they would not be enough to sustain this kind of consumption.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>Obtaining a large number of high-grade martial arts is a necessity.</p><p></p><p>"Most of the supreme martial arts in the jianghu are in the hands of ancient sects and clans. Although I'm not afraid of ordinary sects and clans, it's not a good idea to act rashly against them."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, let's start with the Shenquan Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"With a Refining Bone Realm expert as its pillar, and backed by the Shenwu King, there's a chance they might have some top-grade martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered.</p><p></p><p>His next goal was to perfect the Marrow Cleansing realm.</p><p></p><p>In terms of top-grade martial arts, they were indispensable.</p><p></p><p>The next day, in the Grinding Knife Hall.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang came to pay his respects.</p><p></p><p>As the master of a sect, Gu Yang's bearing had become more steady, and he respectfully bowed to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Father!"</p><p></p><p>"The foundation of the sect is still shallow. Although I've trained many disciples, the time is still too short to become a major force. Now that you are the master of a sect, there are some things that I should pass on to you."</p><p></p><p>As Gu Qingfeng said this, he paused briefly before continuing.</p><p></p><p>"Come in!"</p><p></p><p>Soon after, three middle-aged men in black robes entered.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Your Highness!"</p><p></p><p>The two men bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang, seeing the three who had appeared, couldn't help but have his pupils contract, as he sensed a faint aura of threat from them.</p><p></p><p>It was clear,</p><p></p><p>That these two men's strength was no simple matter.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "This person is called Gu Yi, the leader of the Shadow Guards. The other two are called Gu Er and Gu San, both deputy leaders of the Shadow Guards. All three have reached the complete Refining Impurity Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, the Shadow Guards have a total of 100 members, and the weakest among them have already reached the Refining Bone Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Since you have the ambition to dominate the world, having such a force at your disposal will make things much easier for you!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Gu Qingfeng looked at Gu Yi and the others and said indifferently, "From today onwards, the Shadow Guards will be under Yang'er's command, and you must all obey his orders."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi nodded solemnly, then cupped his fist towards Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>"Subordinate Gu Yi pays respects to the Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Gu Leader, no need for such formalities..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang, until now, could only barely emerge from his shock, looking at the Gu Yi and the others before him, but the shock in his heart had not yet dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought,</p><p></p><p>That his father had such a terrifying force under his control.</p><p></p><p>A hundred Shadow Guards,</p><p></p><p>With the weakest being at the Refining Bone Realm, and Gu Yi and the others having reached the complete Refining Impurity Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was a concept of what kind of strength.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Qingyang Sect that once dominated the Taishan Road only had one or two at the Refining Bone Realm, and even the centuries-old Qingyang Patriarch's strength was at most equivalent to an ordinary Marrow Cleansing Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Shadow Guards' strength could easily surpass ten Qingyang Sects.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Qingfeng had not actively revealed this, Gu Yang would not have known that his father had hidden this so deeply.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

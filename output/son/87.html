        <h1>Chapter 87</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Zhu Ming saw the hanging corpse of Wen Jiao at the city gate at a glance. As a cultivator who had once reached the first realm, even though Wen Jiao had perished and his body had been exposed to the scorching sun for several days, his corpse remained intact.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>Zhu Ming's gaze turned slightly cold, and then in front of everyone's eyes, he snapped the rope suspending the corpse with a flick of his finger, grabbing the falling body and taking it away.</p><p></p><p>This scene</p><p></p><p>caused many people to change their expressions.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>the news of Wen Jiao's body being taken away quickly reached Gu Qingfeng's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Master, a while ago, Zhu Ming, the peak master of the Azure Wood Peak of the Crimson Flame Sect, appeared and took away Wen Jiao's body," Gu Peng reported truthfully in the study.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "Wen Jiao's body is no longer of any use, let the Crimson Flame Sect take it away, there's no need to pay too much attention to it."</p><p></p><p>"Since a peak master of the Crimson Flame Sect has fallen, the Crimson Flame Sect is unlikely to let it go easily. If they come to attack us, do we need to prepare?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng's expression also became slightly grave.</p><p></p><p>He was confident in Gu Qingfeng's strength, but the Crimson Flame Sect was no ordinary force either.</p><p></p><p>Now that Wen Jiao's body had been hung on the White Stone City gate, it was already a slap in the face of the Crimson Flame Sect.</p><p></p><p>"If the Crimson Flame Sect wanted to attack, they would have already made a move. Why wait until now when they've only sent someone to take Wen Jiao's body?"</p><p></p><p>"So the problem with the Crimson Flame Sect doesn't need to be dealt with for now, and the current situation suggests that the Crimson Flame Sect may not even make a move."</p><p></p><p>"Besides... even if the Crimson Flame Sect really does attack, the Gu Family Manor is not without the ability to fight back."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled confidently.</p><p></p><p>It was true that the strength of a thousand-year-old sect was formidable, but he was not necessarily without the ability to clash with such a sect.</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p></p><p>any sect that could survive for a thousand years must have its own way of living.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng killed Wen Jiao, he had only used a single sword strike. As long as the Crimson Flame Sect was not foolish, they would not be willing to fight the Gu Family Manor to the death over this.</p><p></p><p>That sword strike,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had used it to intimidate all parties.</p><p></p><p>Since Wen Jiao's death,</p><p></p><p>the White Stone Road has become much more peaceful.</p><p></p><p>The various jianghu figures who had previously stirred up trouble are now unconsciously low-key, afraid of incurring the wrath of the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Peng was also convinced.</p><p></p><p>"The master's divine might has cowed the Crimson Flame Sect, I imagine they don't dare to attack. Now that the master's Tyrannical Sword reputation has shaken the jianghu, we subordinates are honored!"</p><p></p><p>At the end, Gu Peng also subtly flattered.</p><p></p><p>"Tyrannical Sword..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head and smiled, not paying much attention to these jianghu reputations.</p><p></p><p>"I previously told you to gather a group of orphans on your side, how is the situation now?"</p><p></p><p>"In these chaotic times, there are many children without parents, but as for their innate talent and aptitude, they still need to be carefully screened before we can determine them," Gu Peng said.</p><p></p><p>"Go take a look."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family Manor covers an area of over 300 mu, divided into several zones.</p><p></p><p>The outer court area</p><p></p><p>is the largest of them all.</p><p></p><p>The entire outer court is about 150 mu or so.</p><p></p><p>This is because the outer court has the most disciples, so the area allocated is correspondingly large.</p><p></p><p>In the outer court training ground, numerous ragged children stood there, both boys and girls, but all of them were pale and thin, giving an impression of malnourishment.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>despite their young age, these children...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>There were no extraneous noisy sounds, and when looking at the people in front of them, the children's faces were filled with reverence.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the children before him, and his expression was neither sorrowful nor joyful when he met their clear gazes.</p><p></p><p>"I am Gu Qingfeng, the current master of the Gu Family Manor. In these turbulent times, it is a fortunate thing that you have joined the Gu Family Manor. In the coming days, you will all live within the Gu Family Manor, and there will be dedicated instructors to teach you martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"Those who can successfully enter the Refining Skin Realm within one year will become my formal disciples of the Gu Family Manor. If you enter the Refining Skin Realm within two years, you will be demoted to a menial worker."</p><p></p><p>"In the coming period, I will also have people teach you to read and write. Not everyone has the talent for martial arts, but if you can learn to read and write and serve the manor, you can still remain here."</p><p></p><p>"If you fail to advance to the Refining Skin Realm within two years and do not possess any special skills, then you will have to leave the Gu Family Manor and find another way to live!"</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, there are only two rules in the Gu Family Manor that you must remember. The first is that you must not harm your fellow disciples. If any such incidents are discovered, the punishment will be severe."</p><p></p><p>"The second is that you must not betray us. If you do, it will be a path to certain death!"</p><p></p><p>As Gu Qingfeng spoke the last words, a cold killing intent began to emanate from him, causing many of the children's faces to instinctively turn pale.</p><p></p><p>In these past few days since joining the Gu Family Manor, they had finally been able to eat their fill, and they no longer had to live in constant fear. If they were to be expelled from the Gu Family Manor, they would have to return to that unsettled and drifting life.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of that prospect, many of them trembled.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Qingfeng turned to Gu Peng beside him and instructed him, "Ensure that everyone has enough food and meat. In terms of martial arts training, their nutritional needs must not be lacking."</p><p></p><p>"Understood, my lord!" Gu Peng solemnly nodded.</p><p></p><p>After giving the instructions, Gu Qingfeng turned and left.</p><p></p><p>In this training ground, there were approximately three hundred children, but how many of them would remain after two years was yet to be seen.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng had at least given them an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>After all, in these turbulent times, taking in numerous orphans was a considerable burden for many factions. It was only because the Gu Family Manor was currently the hegemon of the Baishi Dao that they could afford to support and maintain so many.</p><p></p><p>One must know that the consumption required for martial arts training was much higher than normal. If the nutritional and dietary needs were not met, it would easily lead to a depletion of one's qi and blood, causing harm to oneself.</p><p></p><p>This was why the saying "poor in literature, rich in martial arts" had always existed. Without the appropriate conditions, one would not even have the qualifications to step onto the path of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the Crimson Flame Sect, Zhu Ming had brought back the corpse of Wen Jiao.</p><p></p><p>When they saw the wound on Wen Jiao's forehead, splitting him in half, without any other external injuries, everyone couldn't help but furrow their brows. This clearly showed that, just as the rumors said, he had been killed in a single strike by the Gu Family Manor's lord.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Lie approached Wen Jiao's corpse, leaning down and touching the wound. Suddenly, a slight stinging sensation passed through his palm, and he saw blood traces appear on his palm, with faint blood droplets oozing out.</p><p></p><p>This scene left the other Crimson Flame Sect elders greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>They knew that before Ouyang Lie had cultivated demonic arts, he had already reached the third realm of the Refining Impurity stage, with a formidable physical body. Even the Washing Marrow realm would have difficulty breaching his defenses.</p><p></p><p>Yet the remaining power left on Wen Jiao's corpse was able to harm him. This showed just how terrifying that power was.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

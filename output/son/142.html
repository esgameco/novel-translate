        <h1>Chapter 142</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The evil spirit revived, suddenly letting out a roar full of cruelty. Immediately after, the shadowy figure surged towards the shadow under Gu Qingfeng's feet like a tidal wave.</p><p></p><p>This was the ability of the shadowy figure.</p><p></p><p>It could hide within the shadows of others, and even manipulate them, turning them into its puppets.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng would not let the shadowy figure have its way.</p><p></p><p>Given the bizarre nature of the evil spirit, even though Gu Qingfeng was confident in suppressing the shadowy figure, he would not be careless.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stomped his right foot on the ground, the powerful force causing the massive Zhenmo Prison to shake violently. Terrifying vital energy erupted, and the shadowy figure that was about to invade Gu Qingfeng's shadow suddenly let out a piercing, agonizing scream upon touching that scorching vital energy.</p><p></p><p>The shadowy figure retreated, fleeing towards the outside of the Zhenmo Prison.</p><p></p><p>"You think you can escape?" Gu Qingfeng sneered disdainfully, his Demon-Slaying Blade suddenly unsheathed, directly pinning the shadowy figure's body to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The vital energy power within the blade fell upon the shadowy figure, just like the spring sun melting the snow, causing the latter's body to gradually dissolve as it struggled and twisted, letting out one agonizing wail after another.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the sound gradually faded away. On the ground, there was only a bit of black powder left - the existence of the shadowy figure had completely vanished.</p><p></p><p>"The evil spirit is dead!!" Gu Qingfeng's pupils suddenly constricted.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had anticipated this, when he actually witnessed the shadowy figure disappearing before his eyes, Gu Qingfeng still found it somewhat unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>The process of eliminating the shadowy figure had been so smooth, without any complications.</p><p></p><p>But soon, Gu Qingfeng felt at ease.</p><p></p><p>His level of cultivation had already undergone a transformation, no longer comparable to the past. The reason why the evil spirit was so difficult to destroy was that its level of cultivation was too high. </p><p></p><p>But now, it was different.</p><p></p><p>Their levels of cultivation were on the same plane.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the problem of the evil spirit being difficult to destroy no longer existed.</p><p></p><p>After slaying the shadowy figure, Gu Qingfeng quickly released the other evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing and sealing the evil spirits was a last resort.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if he could destroy the evil spirits, Gu Qingfeng naturally did not wish to seal them within the Zhenmo Prison.</p><p></p><p>After all, the existence of the evil spirits was like a time bomb - if one was not careful, it could bring about tremendous trouble.</p><p></p><p>Even though Gu Qingfeng had put in a lot of effort to create this Zhenmo Prison, there were still some hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the second evil spirit was released.</p><p></p><p>This time, the evil spirit seemed to be aware of the shadowy figure's demise, so it didn't even have the intention to fight Gu Qingfeng after emerging, directly rushing towards the outside of the Zhenmo Prison.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Gu Qingfeng had already prepared himself at the side.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the evil spirit trying to escape, he immediately acted to slay it.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the third, fourth, and other evil spirits were released one by one, and then swiftly killed by Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>To be blunt, the evil spirits that could be sealed within the Zhenmo Prison were not that powerful to begin with.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Qingfeng's current Extreme Dao Sect Master cultivation, suppressing these evil spirits was an easy task.</p><p></p><p>Soon, all the evil spirits in the Zhenmo Prison were completely slain.</p><p></p><p>As he walked out of the Zhenmo Prison, he happened to see Hong Ye's solemn expression. When she saw Gu Qingfeng appear, the solemnity on her face dissipated somewhat.</p><p></p><p>"Your Excellency!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, the matter of the Zhenmo Prison has been resolved. You don't need to guard this place anymore," Gu Qingfeng waved his hand, and Hong Ye inwardly heaved a sigh of relief upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When the evil spirit was about to emerge, Hongye could feel that threatening aura. </p><p></p><p>But now, that aura has dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Combining this with what Gu Qingfeng said, Hongye no longer had much worry.</p><p></p><p>After Hongye left,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng returned to the Grinding Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Now,</p><p></p><p>Inside the Grinding Pavilion,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"Slay the evil spirit!"</p><p></p><p>"This proves that the path I have taken is correct."</p><p></p><p>"The reason why the martial dao in this world has difficulty thriving is because the martial dao is flawed, or one could say, the people who created the martial dao originally did not truly walk the right path."</p><p></p><p>"As a result, although the martial dao has been established, it is ultimately incomplete. With the emergence of the evil spirit, people have derived the profession of sorcerers in order to resist the evil spirit."</p><p></p><p>"But clearly, the appearance of sorcerers is not as originally envisioned, existing solely to deal with the evil spirit."</p><p></p><p>"The dragon slayer eventually becomes the evil dragon!"</p><p></p><p>"Those who bear the evil spirit within themselves will inevitably be polluted by the power of the evil spirit, and their downfall is unavoidable."</p><p></p><p>"All these reasons are the fundamental causes that have led to the collapse of the order in this world."</p><p></p><p>"Now, if the martial dao rises up and eliminates both the so-called evil spirits and sorcerers, the problem can be alleviated to a large extent--"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not consider himself a savior, but as long as it was within his abilities, there was nothing wrong with doing something for the people of the world.</p><p></p><p>At the moment,</p><p></p><p>He already had this ability.</p><p></p><p>The downfall of the evil spirit</p><p></p><p>was enough to prove this.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>If the news of him slaying the evil spirit were to spread, Gu Qingfeng could be certain that all the sorcerers and the so-called immortal sects would be unable to sit still.</p><p></p><p>It's simple.</p><p></p><p>The creation of the perfect martial dao will inevitably threaten the status of the sorcerers.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Qingfeng did not care about that.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>In the time to come,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng would be fully devoted to comprehending the martial dao, aiming to create the true perfect martial dao through his own efforts.</p><p></p><p>For this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng summoned Gu Peng again.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Elder Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Tell Alang to gather all the martial arts from all directions and send them to the Grinding Pavilion, I have great use for them!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the other did not ask for the reason, but directly accepted the order and left.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng began to enter seclusion.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to collect all the martial arts in the world, and of course, he would use his own body as a furnace to refine the hundreds of scriptures, and ultimately give birth to the true perfect martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng had already stepped into the ranks of the perfect martial dao, creating a martial art was not a simple matter.</p><p></p><p>The stones from other mountains can attack the jade.</p><p></p><p>It is true that the martial dao in the world is flawed, but there are still places worth learning from.</p><p></p><p>On the other side,</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng also hurried, and soon found Gu Yang's main army.</p><p></p><p>Now Gu Yang had just led the army to conquer Banan Road and was resting, so he saw Gu Peng arrive.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master Gu has come, does Father have any important matters?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang asked.</p><p></p><p>He knew that Gu Peng was his father's trusted aide, always following him to handle affairs. Now that this person had come to Banan Road in person, there must be a reason.</p><p></p><p>"To report to the Master, the Elder Master has sent me here, indeed there are some matters to convey!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

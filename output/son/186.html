        <h1>Chapter 186</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang swung his blade again, severing the head of another defending general. He then roared furiously.</p><p></p><p>Witnessing this scene, the defending soldiers were gripped with fear.</p><p></p><p>This battle - they were at a complete disadvantage from the start. If not for the advantage of the city walls, they would have been utterly routed long ago.</p><p></p><p>Now, the formidable power Gu Yang had displayed had become the final straw that broke their morale.</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>Someone was the first to throw down their weapon. </p><p></p><p>In an instant, it was like a chain reaction. </p><p></p><p>Quickly, a second person, a third person, and then more began discarding their weapons.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, a faint smile appeared on Gu Yang's face. But suddenly, a strange, icy aura descended upon him, causing his blood to freeze and his body to become immobilized.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Yang's vision, a figure appeared like a ghostly specter. As he looked towards it, he met its icy gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Insolence!" </p><p></p><p>This sight enraged Gu Yun.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to intervene.</p><p></p><p>But he was too late.</p><p></p><p>For the one who struck was too skilled in timing, with movements impossibly fast.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the assailant rushing towards Gu Yang, Gu Yun's eyes bulged with fury. </p><p></p><p>If Gu Yang were to die here, he could imagine Gu Qingfeng's wrath - at that point, even the Divine Martial Sect would not be spared.</p><p></p><p>The rage of a martial dao saint could stir up a calamitous slaughter.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, based on Gu Yun's understanding of Gu Qingfeng, the latter was no soft-hearted person. If such a powerful expert were to unleash their full fury, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Yang absolutely could not die.</p><p></p><p>But the assailant's attack was too swift, and Gu Yun could only watch helplessly as Gu Yang was about to meet his demise.</p><p></p><p>However - </p><p></p><p>Just as the blow was about to land, Gu Yang heard a melodious clang of a blade, and suddenly felt a great lightness. A terrifying aura of the blade then cleaved the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A crimson blade qi filled his vision, and the eyes of the attacking expert suddenly widened in shock, the cold smile on his face turning to one of terror.</p><p></p><p>In the next instant, the blade qi dissipated, and the assailant's body was split in two, dying on the spot.</p><p></p><p>The entire sequence of events happened in the blink of an eye - from the mysterious expert's attack to his counterattack and demise, all within a breath or two.</p><p></p><p>As the assailant fell, Gu Yun rushed to Gu Yang's side.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, are you alright?" he asked, still shaken.</p><p></p><p>It was just a hair's breadth. Gu Yang had nearly met his end here.</p><p></p><p>If he had died, the Divine Martial Sect would surely have been uprooted in retaliation.</p><p></p><p>But amidst the relief, Gu Yun looked at the sheathed Zhu Xie Sword with awe.</p><p></p><p>A divine weapon come to life, capable of slaying a master!</p><p></p><p>Recalling that single strike, Gu Yun doubted he could have withstood it himself. If the Zhu Xie Sword, Gu Qingfeng's own blade, was this terrifying, then Gu Qingfeng's true abilities could only be described as unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Gu Yang had also regained his composure, feeling reassured by the presence of the Zhu Xie Sword at his back.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had the foresight.</p><p></p><p>If not for the Zhu Xie Sword's protection, he would have surely met his demise this time.</p><p></p><p>After all, who could have anticipated that a powerful expert would strike from the shadows, at least at the level of a master, in this seemingly decided battle?</p><p></p><p>Looking at the bisected corpse, still emanating a sinister aura, Gu Yang's gaze turned cold once more.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Sorcerer!" </p><p></p><p>He had originally thought the other party was a master. </p><p></p><p>But now it appears, he is a sorcerer who has reached the Fusion Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, </p><p></p><p>Gu Yi and the imperial guards also arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Your subordinate was late in coming to your rescue, please forgive me, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"Investigate this person's identity, see which force he belongs to."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The other party was wearing the attire of an ordinary soldier, which was the fundamental reason for his oversight.</p><p></p><p>After this incident,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang became even more cautious in his heart.</p><p></p><p>When he stepped into the vortex of the struggle for the world, there would undoubtedly be many people secretly wanting to take his life.</p><p></p><p>Only by being sufficiently cautious in his actions could he avoid these dangers.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that the power of the Demon-Slaying Sword was wasted!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Gu Yi's words, Gu Yang shook his head inwardly again.</p><p></p><p>The Demon-Slaying Sword could unleash three attacks, and even evil spirits could be slain.</p><p></p><p>The sorcerer who attacked him was killed by the Demon-Slaying Sword, and the evil spirit within him was also extinguished, which was equivalent to wasting one of the Demon-Slaying Sword's uses.</p><p></p><p>The remaining two uses,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang would not use them lightly.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the Demon-Slaying Sword's power, the last two uses could play a crucial role at a critical moment.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at the defeated troops who had all thrown down their weapons and surrendered, and summoned a general.</p><p></p><p>"Imprison all these surrendered troops, if they are willing to join my Guangyang Army, then they can be selectively recruited, if they are unwilling to join the Guangyang Army, then confiscate their weapons and dismiss them directly."</p><p></p><p>"I will obey the order, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>The general saluted and left.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had no intention of completely annihilating them.</p><p></p><p>After all, what he wanted was the entire world, not just an empty shell.</p><p></p><p>Different camps fighting each other, killing was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>But now that these defeated troops had surrendered, Gu Yang naturally could not do such a thing as killing the surrendered.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, killing the surrendered would only worsen his reputation, which was not conducive to his later struggle for the world.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, these people were mostly from Nanyang Prefecture, if too many were killed, it would not be beneficial for the development of Nanyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, for various reasons, Gu Yang was lenient.</p><p></p><p>If they were willing to join the Guangyang Army, that would be best, if they were unwilling to join, then they would be dismissed after their weapons were confiscated, and they would not be able to cause much trouble.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these were rebels under the command of the rebels, they would not have much sense of belonging to that side.</p><p></p><p>As long as the leader was eliminated, the rest would not be a concern.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, </p><p></p><p>in the government office in the city.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang sat there, and in front of him were the other army generals, as well as Gu Yi and others.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, </p><p></p><p>Gu Yi stepped forward and cupped his hands, saying: "Your Majesty, the identity of the assassin has been investigated, and he is Nanggong Yu, the commander of the Exorcism Bureau of Nanyang Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>"It is said that this person is a Qi and Blood Grandmaster, and later cultivated evil arts and achieved the Fusion Spirit Realm, which is why he was qualified to serve as the commander of the Exorcism Bureau of Nanyang Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>With these words spoken,</p><p></p><p>many people's expressions changed.</p><p></p><p>The Exorcism Bureau of Nanyang Prefecture!</p><p></p><p>This was an institution under the control of the Taixuan Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang did not have much interaction with the existence of the Exorcism Bureau.</p><p></p><p>After all, when he occupied Guangyang Prefecture and Taishan Prefecture, the people of the Exorcism Bureau had already withdrawn.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had originally thought that the powerful person who tried to assassinate him might be from the Tianyang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>But he never imagined,</p><p></p><p>the one who came would be a commander of the Exorcism Bureau.</p><p></p><p>A prefectural commander,</p><p></p><p>his strength and status were both astonishing.</p><p></p><p>It's just a pity,</p><p></p><p>Nanggong Yu had overestimated himself and underestimated the existence of the Demon-Slaying Sword.

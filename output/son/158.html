        <h1>Chapter 158</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Sss, the Elder of the Taisuzu Sect is truly formidable! Such a terrifying aura!"</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that this person is a peak expert at the Fusion Spirit Realm, but now it seems he is almost ready to break through to the Transformation Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that the Taisuzu Sect has summoned Jiang Shidao here with the intention of having him devour the Grand Master of the Guangyang Mansion, in order to break through his own bottleneck and directly reach the Transformation Realm."</p><p></p><p>"I see now."</p><p></p><p>When they saw Jiang Shidao appear, many people's expressions changed.</p><p></p><p>The Elder of the Taisuzu Sect.</p><p></p><p>A peak expert at the Fusion Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>But now, it seems the outside rumors were mistaken.</p><p></p><p>The experts of the major powers could all see that Jiang Shidao's aura was not just at the peak of the Fusion Spirit Realm, but could be considered to be at the half-step Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators of the same realm have always been considered the strongest. </p><p></p><p>A half-step Transformation Realm cultivator, to a certain extent, is already not weaker than Grand Masters of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>In a certain restaurant.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun watched the scene below, his brows furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Half-step Transformation Realm, it seems there are quite a few forces eyeing the Grand Master of the Guangyang Mansion. The Taisuzu Sect is already an immortal sect, if they gain another Transformation Realm expert, their strength will be truly terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>After learning about Gu Qingfeng's news, Gu Yun immediately came to the Qingyun State. </p><p></p><p>However, the distance between Wu State and Qingyun State was vast. </p><p></p><p>Despite Gu Yun's best efforts to hurry, he still couldn't arrive before the other forces.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he arrived, he witnessed Gu Yi openly slaying Jiang Mo on the street.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, in the current situation where cultivators dominate the world, for someone to be so courageous as to directly slay a disciple of an immortal sect on the street, this bravery alone is unmatched by others.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Yun was quite appreciative of Gu Yi.</p><p></p><p>Now, seeing Jiang Shidao about to make a move, Gu Yun had the idea to rescue him.</p><p></p><p>Even if this action might offend the Taisuzu Sect and bring hidden troubles to the Shenwu Sect, Gu Yun didn't really care.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Yun's eyes, with Gu Yi's strength, he would definitely not be Jiang Shidao's match.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention Gu Yi, even Gu Yun himself might not be fully confident in suppressing the other party.</p><p></p><p>After all, a half-step Transformation Realm expert is already comparable to a Grand Master of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, on the street, Jiang Shidao directly made his move, the black spiritual energy surging out, forming a terrifying and ferocious hand that pressed down towards Gu Yi.</p><p></p><p>This strike was the other party's enraged attack.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi only felt a pressure like a mountain bearing down on him, and the blood and qi in his body seemed to be frozen under this cold and eerie aura.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to draw his sword, but found that he had no chance to do so in the face of Jiang Shidao.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Innate Grand Master appeared weak and powerless.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a terrifyingly powerful sword intent surged into the sky, causing all the people in the Guangyang Mansion to instinctively feel a chill, as if they were being targeted by a terrifying existence.</p><p></p><p>The sword intent shone like the blazing sun, illuminating the void. </p><p></p><p>All the cold and eerie auras dissipated like snow melting under the spring sun.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Jiang Shidao found himself locked onto by this sword intent, the shadow of death almost completely engulfing him, the arrogance and ferocity on his face now replaced by panic and fear.</p><p></p><p>"The one causing trouble in the Guangyang Mansion, be slain!"</p><p></p><p>As the word "slain" fell, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth was drawn by the sword intent, finally coalescing into a...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The divine sword of the heavenly god suddenly slashed down towards Jiang Shidao.</p><p></p><p>"No—" The latter's expression was one of terror, wanting to beg for mercy, but he found that it was too late.</p><p></p><p>The divine sword descended.</p><p></p><p>Blood sprayed.</p><p></p><p>The venerable elder of the Taisuozong, a cultivator who was suspected to be at the half-step Huasheng realm and could rival the great Dao masters, was directly slain on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Silence! The entire street was deathly quiet!</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked on with horrified expressions, seeing Jiang Shidao's body split in two, and the evil entity that revived on the corpse, which proved that he had indeed perished.</p><p></p><p>Finally, someone couldn't help but take a sharp intake of breath.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the entire street erupted in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Shidao is dead!"</p><p></p><p>"Slain in a single stroke, the one who struck must be the Hegemon Sword Gu Qingfeng!"</p><p></p><p>"What a Hegemon Sword, truly terrifying, even the powerful Jiang Shidao couldn't withstand his long-range strike. Just how powerful is this person's cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Understandably so.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Shidao's death had brought them a tremendous impact.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful cultivator, only a step away from the Huasheng realm, was one of the true top experts in the Nine Provinces. </p><p></p><p>Yet, he was slain in a single stroke.</p><p></p><p>Yes, slain in a single stroke!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Shidao had no chance to resist at all throughout the entire process.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the evil entity revived.</p><p></p><p>Another blood-red divine sword suddenly appeared, directly pinning the revived evil entity to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the members of Gu Yao's secret guards also reacted, immediately moving to suppress the evil entity.</p><p></p><p>After the evil entity was sealed and suppressed, the divine sword shot up into the sky and disappeared from everyone's sight.</p><p></p><p>Commanding the sword to slay the enemy! Truly terrifying! Those who previously looked down on Gu Yang and the Gu Clan Manor behind him, now had their disdain completely vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Before Gu Qingfeng acted, no one believed that he could withstand the Tianyang Sword Sect, let alone be a match for Gu Yutian.</p><p></p><p>But now—</p><p></p><p>Seeing Jiang Shidao's corpse, everyone fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Slaying a cultivator on par with the great Dao masters in a single stroke, and Gu Qingfeng had not even truly revealed himself throughout.</p><p></p><p>Even if Gu Yutian personally took action, whether he could achieve this level was debatable.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"A great Dao master!"</p><p></p><p>"No, this is definitely not an ordinary great Dao master!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he has already become a True Meaning great Dao master!?"</p><p></p><p>In the restaurant above, Gu Yun was also utterly shocked, not even realizing that the wine cup in his hand had been crushed.</p><p></p><p>Understandably so.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's strike had brought him a tremendous shock.</p><p></p><p>Even though Gu Yun had already estimated Gu Qingfeng's strength as high as possible, the result still showed that he had underestimated the other party.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Jiang Shidao's strength was not inferior to ordinary great Dao masters.</p><p></p><p>For Gu Qingfeng to be able to slay him with a long-range strike, he was at least at the level of a True Meaning great Dao master.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even a True Meaning great Dao master might not necessarily be able to slay an ordinary great Dao master with a long-range strike.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Tianyang Sword Sect may not gain any benefits from this battle. If Gu Qingfeng does not die, perhaps the declining Dao cultivation can be revived. Such a powerful cultivator must be brought back to the Shenwu Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun became somewhat uneasy, he directly threw down a silver piece and then left in a leisurely manner.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

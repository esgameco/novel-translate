        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has gained some understanding of the true essence of taming beasts!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has made progress in his cultivation after being guided by a Realm of Divine Transformation cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Shengnan' has gained some insights from cultivating the Qinglian Sword Classic, and her strength has increased slightly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has gained some understanding from cultivating the Sun and Moon Fist Classic, and his cultivation has increased slightly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has obtained an inheritance left behind by a mysterious powerful expert, and his strength has increased!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has been guided by the remnant soul of a powerful expert, and his cultivation has increased!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has consumed an ancient elixir, and his cultivation has broken through greatly, reaching the peak of the Refining Bone Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +30 Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has consumed an ancient elixir, and his cultivation has broken through greatly, reaching the initial stage of the Marrow Cleansing Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +50 Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has consumed an ancient elixir, and his cultivation has broken through greatly, reaching the middle stage of the Marrow Cleansing Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +50 Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Mysterious inheritance!"</p><p></p><p>"Remnant soul of a powerful expert?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the text appearing on the information panel, his expression slightly strange.</p><p></p><p>After moving the Gu family manor to the capital, Gu Xiu had been out on a journey of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, Gu Qingfeng did not stop him.</p><p></p><p>He only repeatedly warned Gu Xiu not to enter the Ancient Beast Mountain Range recklessly, as it was extremely dangerous, and one could easily lose their life there.</p><p></p><p>To this, Gu Xiu had nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>What Gu Qingfeng did not expect was that Gu Xiu had barely left the Gu family manor when he encountered an extraordinary opportunity, and it seemed he had even obtained a mysterious elder.</p><p></p><p>A remnant soul of a powerful expert! This was something quite familiar.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Yang, Gu Xuan, and now Gu Xiu, Gu Qingfeng couldn't help but ponder.</p><p></p><p>He realized that the fortunes of his descendants seemed to be quite good.</p><p></p><p>But this was not a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>Raising his descendants in a free and unrestrained manner allowed for more uncertainties.</p><p></p><p>Like Gu Xiu, for example.</p><p></p><p>His original cultivation level had already been several realms behind Gu Xuan, but now a single ancient elixir had completely made up for that gap.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Xiu had stayed in the Gu family manor and cultivated diligently, it would have been questionable whether he could have broken through to the peak of the Refining Bone Realm, let alone the Marrow Cleansing Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, Xuan and Xiu are about the right age to get married and start a family, should I urge them to take wives and expand the Gu family bloodline..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered for a moment, then shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Well, the fortune of the descendants is up to them. I shouldn't force such matters."</p><p></p><p>"Continuing the bloodline should rely on the eldest, Gu Yang."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had already become the lord of the Nine Provinces, and had sired three offspring. Given his current status and position, he was destined to leave behind an even greater bloodline legacy.</p><p></p><p>So Gu Qingfeng believed Gu Yang would naturally understand this.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, Gu Qingfeng turned his attention back to the Primal Heavenly Saber.</p><p></p><p>The profound mysteries of this Saint-Emperor's supreme technique were truly extraordinary. Although Gu Qingfeng had just begun to learn it, further advancement was not easy.</p><p></p><p>If he wanted to use Cultivation Points to improve the Primal Heavenly Saber, it would require a full 2,000 Cultivation Points.</p><p></p><p>For Gu Qingfeng's current situation, 2,000 Cultivation Points was a bit too much.</p><p></p><p>However, now that Gu Yang and the others had all grown up, each breakthrough in their cultivation realms could bring a substantial amount of Cultivation Points, far more than in the past.</p><p></p><p>For example, the other offspring besides Gu Yang only received 20 Cultivation Points when breaking through the Refining Blood Realm, but the breakthrough to the Marrow Cleansing Realm already yielded 50 Cultivation Points.</p><p></p><p>This was a doubling of the reward.</p><p></p><p>And then there was Gu Yang's breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>When he broke through to the Patriarch Realm, he was able to provide 300 Cultivation Points at once. And now, upon reaching the Great Patriarch Realm, he could provide 500 Cultivation Points.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Yang could break through from the initial Great Patriarch Realm to the peak, that would be a total of 2,000 Cultivation Points.</p><p></p><p>Viewed in this light, the 2,000 Cultivation Points required to improve the Saint-Emperor's supreme technique did not seem so difficult to obtain.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, as Gu Yang was able to break through the Great Patriarch bottleneck and reach the Realm of Divine Transformation and even higher realms, the Cultivation Points he could provide would only increase.</p><p></p><p>This was the advantage of having the first-born offspring.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Senior, is the Primal Realm truly filled with powerful experts?" </p><p></p><p>In a certain restaurant, Gu Xiu, dressed in sturdy attire, sat alone at a table with food and wine, but his mind was focused on the ring in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Within this ring was the remnant soul of a self-proclaimed Primal Emperor Saint.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Primal Emperor Saint spoke in a deep voice, "The Primal Realm is divided into five domains, with numerous top sects and powerful families. The experts there are truly beyond your imagination."</p><p></p><p>"In your Nine Provinces, reaching the Great Patriarch Realm is already an extremely rare feat. But in the South Domain where I once founded the Primal Emperor Sacred Land, even the lower-level disciples were considered Great Patriarchs."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Xiu was greatly shaken.</p><p></p><p>The five domains of the Primal Realm! The Primal Emperor Sacred Land!</p><p></p><p>Just from the Primal Emperor Saint's few words, Gu Xiu could already glimpse the vast and expansive world.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, Gu Xiu curiously asked, "Since you are a powerful expert from the South Domain, why have you appeared in the Nine Provinces?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Primal Emperor Saint fell silent for a while.</p><p></p><p>After a long pause, he slowly spoke, "The Nine Provinces are not as simple as you think. There are legends that in the most ancient times, a peerless force once arose from here."</p><p></p><p>"This force originated from the Nine Provinces and exerted its dominance over the entire Primal Realm. But later, for some unknown reason, this force collapsed overnight, and even the spiritual veins of the Nine Provinces were shattered, causing the land to gradually decline in spiritual energy and fall into obscurity."</p><p></p><p>"Many powerful experts from other domains entered the Nine Provinces, seeking to find the inheritance of that peerless force, but all returned empty-handed. Over time, the Nine Provinces faded from the sight of the Primal Realm."</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiu listened, his heart stirring.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Provinces have such a history? Then why did you fall here, Senior?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiu asked the question that was on his mind.</p><p></p><p>Given the Primal Emperor Saint's strength, he should not have perished in the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>After all, from the Primal Emperor Saint's own words, he had some understanding of the cultivation system beyond the Great Patriarch Realm. The Realm of Divine Transformation, the Dao Palace, and the Saint-Emperor - the power of such existences was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>The Primal Emperor Saint sighed bitterly, "When I entered the Nine Provinces, I sought to find a breakthrough, but unexpectedly triggered the remnant restrictions left behind by that peerless force of old. I was then severely injured and perished. </p><p></p><p>If I did not have this precious treasure to protect me, I would have long since been destroyed. As it is, only a fragment of my soul remains, slumbering."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Although I have used secret techniques to preserve my soul, it is now difficult for me to maintain it for much longer."</p><p></p><p>"If you cannot find an opportunity for me to condense a physical body, in another one or two thousand years, I will completely dissipate into the heavens and earth."</p><p></p><p>With that, the Supreme Emperor Extreme let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he had already reached the peak of the Great Saint realm, hoping to make further breakthroughs, but unexpectedly ended up trapped here.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, the Supreme Emperor Extreme also had some regrets.</p><p></p><p>If he had not ventured into the Nine Provinces, with his natural talent, he might have broken through the boundaries long ago, and would not have fallen into such a predicament.</p><p></p><p>But now, regretting was useless.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators at the Great Saint realm could live for eight thousand years, and when the Supreme Emperor Extreme fell, he had already lived for six thousand years. He later used secret techniques to seal his own body, so that he would not be affected by the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>But now, upon awakening, the seal has been lifted on its own. If he cannot condense a physical body and make a breakthrough, he will only be able to endure for another one or two thousand years before reaching the end of his lifespan.</p><p></p><p>"This disciple will do his utmost to inherit the legacy of the senior."</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiu said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Supreme Emperor Extreme spoke again: "The Nine Provinces were indeed very powerful in the past, but that was ancient history. The decline of the Nine Provinces is a fact.</p><p></p><p>With your talent, staying here would be a waste. </p><p></p><p>I established a sacred land in the Southern Domain thirty million years ago. You can take my token and go to the Southern Domain. If you can be accepted into the Imperial Extreme Sacred Land, you can save a lot of trouble."</p><p></p><p>At the end, the Supreme Emperor Extreme reminded him.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... Does the power that the senior established thirty million years ago still exist?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the Imperial Extreme Sacred Land I established back then was the top power in the Southern Domain. Even after my demise in the Nine Provinces, it has continued its legacy for tens of thousands of years without any difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Do not underestimate me just because I have perished. The truth is, in every era, there are not many who can enter the Great Saint realm."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Xiu's underestimation, the Supreme Emperor Extreme laughed angrily.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiu was silenced, but then asked curiously, "What does the senior mean by the 'Dao not yet manifesting'?"</p><p></p><p>"In the Desolate Ancient Realm, the Dao manifests every ten thousand years. As the Dao manifests, it signifies that the era has truly entered its prime.</p><p></p><p>In the era when the Dao manifests, cultivation will become much easier than before. The Dao Palace can be entered by Saints, Saints can enter the Great Saint realm, and Great Saints can also glimpse the path ahead, and gradually reach the peak, even to the point of becoming Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>When he mentioned the word "Immortal" at the end, the Supreme Emperor Extreme's tone became somewhat fervent.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal!? Are there really Immortals in this world?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiu couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Emperor Extreme's tone became more somber again: "Whether there are truly Immortals in this world, no one knows for sure. However, I've heard that the disappearance of the unparalleled powers in the Nine Provinces was related to Immortals.</p><p></p><p>But throughout the endless ages, whether there have been true experts who have stepped onto the Immortal path and attained Immortality, even I am not certain.</p><p></p><p>However, since there are legends of Immortals, they must exist to some extent."</p><p></p><p>Immortality! It has been the lifelong pursuit of the strongest experts in the Desolate Ancient Realm.</p><p></p><p>If Immortality was just a myth, why would these experts have been so persistently seeking it?</p><p></p><p>Then, the Supreme Emperor Extreme shifted the topic: "The manifestation of the Dao is the era of the Great Contention, the peak of an era, but also the beginning of the decline of the next era.</p><p></p><p>When the Dao hides and the Heavenly Dao is obscured, it becomes much more difficult for cultivators to break through. Even if there are geniuses with extraordinary talents, reaching the peak of the Dao Palace realm and becoming a Saint would be extremely difficult in this era!"</p><p></p><p>"You must know, each era lasts thirteen thousand years - ten thousand years of Decline, and three thousand years of Prosperity. For the geniuses born in the early Decline, to actually survive until the three thousand years of Prosperity, is an extremely difficult feat.</p><p></p><p>Even Cultivators at the ninth level of the Dao Palace realm only have a lifespan of around six thousand years!"</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Emperor Extreme's words suddenly made Gu Xiu understand the tragedy of these geniuses.</p><p></p><p>The era of Decline.</p><p>Difficult to become a Saint.</p><p></p><p>Although they were geniuses with extraordinary talents, in the three thousand years of the Great Contention, they had the hope of becoming Saints, but in the end, they could only perish in obscurity.</p><p></p><p>This was indeed a tragic fate for these geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiu said, "Then does the senior know whether the current era is the era of Decline, or the era of the Great Contention?"</p><p></p><p>"Since the Dao is not yet manifested, it should be the era of Decline."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Supreme Emperor Extreme's words, Gu Xiu's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>Then, the other party added a sentence.</p><p></p><p>"However, although the Dao is not yet manifested, there are already some slight fluctuations. If I'm not mistaken, the current era should be the late stage of the Decline, and perhaps in another one or two thousand years, it will truly enter the era of the Great Contention!"</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, your luck is not bad. With your talent, if you can endure until the era of the Great Contention, you will definitely have the opportunity to shine brilliantly!"</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Emperor Extreme had a high opinion of Gu Xiu. His talent was excellent, and he was very compatible with the legacy he had left behind.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Xiu's talent, reaching Sainthood in the future would not be a problem, and he might even have the chance to advance further, to the Great Saint realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, as for going even higher, in the Supreme Emperor Extreme's view, the possibility was not very great.</p><p></p><p>However, throughout the history of the Five Domains of the Desolate Ancient Realm, the true experts who had broken through the limits of Sainthood and attained the Great Saint realm were few and far between.</p><p></p><p>"Take one step at a time in your cultivation. The Nine Provinces are ultimately too small. At your current age, you haven't even completed the Refined Body realm in the Nine Provinces, but if you were in the Southern Domain, geniuses of your age would already have reached the Sect Master or even Great Sect Master realm.</p><p></p><p>Some prodigies have even reached the Divine Change realm."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, I suggest that you go to the Southern Domain immediately, return to the Imperial Extreme Sacred Land, and then obtain some of the secret realm opportunities I have left behind. With that, reaching the Dao Palace realm before the era of the Great Contention arrives should not be a problem."</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Emperor Extreme's words made Gu Xiu fall into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he said with a determined expression, "The senior's words make sense. However, leaving the Nine Provinces is a major decision. I need to go back home first and bid farewell to my parents before going to the Southern Domain."</p><p></p><p>"That's fine."</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Emperor Extreme nodded, and at the end, he reminded Gu Xiu again.</p><p></p><p>"But regarding my existence, you must not casually reveal it, not even to your parents. You must know that the legacy of a Great Saint involves too many complicated matters. Until you have attained Sainthood, you cannot let anyone know about this."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Xiu nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>He understood the Supreme Emperor Extreme's concerns.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Xiu tossed a silver coin and then flew away.</p>

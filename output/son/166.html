        <h1>Chapter 166</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Commanding the world for three thousand years.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of Ji Chunqiu, the current imperial court is the imperial court, and the Ji family is the Ji family, with little connection between the two.</p><p></p><p>Let him await his death.</p><p></p><p>This is something Ji Chunqiu absolutely cannot tolerate.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately.</p><p></p><p>Now, the warlords have gathered in the Central Plains.</p><p></p><p>The world is on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>The immortal sects and powerful families, even though the Ji family imperial court has accumulated enough foundation over the past three thousand years, it is still just a wishful thinking to contend with these sects and families.</p><p></p><p>At present.</p><p></p><p>There has emerged a powerful figure in Guangyang Prefecture who can rival the Martial Ancestor from a millennium ago, which has given Ji Chunqiu a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>He wants to fight! The previous dynasty was able to maintain its rule for six hundred years, so the Taixuan Imperial House can do the same.</p><p></p><p>Not just six hundred years!</p><p></p><p>Ji Chunqiu wants even more.</p><p></p><p>Immediately.</p><p></p><p>Ji Chunqiu drafted an imperial edict and sent his trusted subordinate to deliver it to Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>Now.</p><p></p><p>The winds of change are sweeping across the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>The battle in Guangyang Prefecture has completely shattered the existing order of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>A supreme expert who can rival the Martial Ancestor from a millennium ago is capable of stirring the hearts of the people.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful figure, if he were to intervene in the great tide of the world, would have the qualifications to reshape the pattern of the world.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng paid no heed to the reactions of the various forces in the world. At the moment, he was meeting with Gu Yun.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Gu, I previously offended you, I hope you will not blame me for it!"</p><p></p><p>Now, Gu Yun had lowered his stance greatly, no longer having the idea of conversing with Gu Qingfeng as an equal.</p><p></p><p>Ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>This is a figure who can rival the Martial Ancestor, how could Gu Yun have the qualifications to converse with him as an equal.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful figure.</p><p></p><p>Even with Gu Yun's status, he had to respectfully address him as "Senior".</p><p></p><p>"Senior Gu, you jest, I am not worthy of being addressed as 'Senior'."</p><p></p><p>"In the past, I was presumptuous. With your peerless cultivation, rivaling the Martial Ancestor from a millennium ago, it is only reasonable for me to address you as 'Senior'."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Even if he had ten times the courage, he would not dare to engage in an equal dialogue with Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>This is the change brought about by strength.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not dwell on this topic any further.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun shifted the topic and cautiously asked, "Now that the issue with the Tianyang Sword Sect has been resolved, does Senior Gu have any thoughts of going to the Shenwu Sect?"</p><p></p><p>If it were in the past,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun believed that with the secrets left behind by the Martial Ancestor that surpassed Grand Masters, it would be enough to captivate the other party.</p><p></p><p>But now,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun was no longer certain.</p><p></p><p>After all, the person in front of him is a figure who can rival the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>The things left behind by the Martial Ancestor may not even pique his interest.</p><p></p><p>"I will go to the Shenwu Sect, but not now, only when the Guangyang Army reaches Wuzhou!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said.</p><p></p><p>As for the things left behind by the Martial Ancestor, Gu Qingfeng was indeed curious.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>he cannot leave Guangyang Prefecture right now.</p><p></p><p>After all, with Gu Yutian's death, Guangyang Prefecture is bound to become the center of the storm in the world. If there is not enough powerful force to suppress the situation, the consequences will be severe.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Yang has a group of not-so-weak forces under his command, these forces may not be enough to deal with the so-called immortal sects and powerful families.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng cannot leave directly.</p><p></p><p>Reach Wuzhou!</p><p></p><p>Hearing his words, Gu Yun was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Gu, do you truly have the ambition to conquer the world?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Why not?" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng asked in return.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun was stunned into silence.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he also realized that his previous question was rather foolish.</p><p></p><p>With the other party's strength, there was nothing preventing them from vying for dominion over the world.</p><p></p><p>The position of the ruler of the world,</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, belonged to those with the power to claim it.</p><p></p><p>As an existence that could stand shoulder to shoulder with the Martial Ancestor, if Gu Qingfeng truly desired to strive for supremacy over the world, he would face no obstacles.</p><p></p><p>"Evil spirits are rampant!"</p><p></p><p>"Sorcerers are causing havoc!"</p><p></p><p>"The order of the Nine Provinces has long been rotten to the core, and now the heavens and earth are murky. We must purge the world and restore order!"</p><p></p><p>As Gu Qingfeng spoke these words,</p><p></p><p>He looked at Gu Yun, his expression suddenly turning solemn.</p><p></p><p>"As far as I know, the Divine Martial Sect has not colluded with sorcerers and evil spirits. Now that the King of Guangyang seeks to contend for the world, to purge the world and reestablish the heavens and earth, is the Divine Martial Sect willing to lend its assistance?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing these words,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun's expression also changed involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's current goal was to have the Divine Martial Sect take a stance.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun hesitated for less than a breath before solemnly declaring, "The King of Guangyang has a reputation for virtue, and the Divine Martial Sect shall follow him!"</p><p></p><p>There was nothing to hesitate about.</p><p></p><p>Anyone with clear eyes could see that while the King of Guangyang's current power was weak, this was only temporary.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Qingfeng, a powerful expert, backing him, expanding his influence would be a simple matter.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of the Divine Martial Sect's existence was to revive the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Now, seeing the opportunity to align with Gu Qingfeng, Gu Yun would not refuse.</p><p></p><p>"It is an honor for the King to receive the assistance of the Divine Martial Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang, who had been silent the entire time, now revealed a faint smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>He was well aware of the strength of the Divine Martial Sect.</p><p></p><p>Now, with just a few words, Gu Qingfeng had managed to rally the Divine Martial Sect to their side, which was greatly beneficial for Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>As the number one martial dao sect in the world, the Divine Martial Sect's strength, even if not as formidable as the immortal family sects, was certainly not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>"The King is too kind. The Divine Martial Sect currently has nine Primal Realm Masters, six Qi and Blood Realm Masters, and five True Meaning Realm Masters, all of whom can follow the King of Guangyang's orders!"</p><p></p><p>After confirming their decision to support Gu Yang, Gu Yun did not hesitate to reveal the Divine Martial Sect's strengths, directly stating their powerful foundation.</p><p></p><p>At a time like this, openly displaying one's strength could make the other party value them even more.</p><p></p><p>As expected,</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing about the Divine Martial Sect's foundation, Gu Yang's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>Twenty masters! And five of them were even in the True Meaning Realm.</p><p></p><p>Such power was truly formidable.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Shadow Guards had eleven masters, but there were still differences between masters.</p><p></p><p>The Primal Realm Masters were the weakest among the masters.</p><p></p><p>In comparison,</p><p></p><p>The Qi and Blood Realm Masters, who were also ordinary masters, were strictly speaking three times stronger than the Primal Realm Masters.</p><p></p><p>And then there were the True Meaning Realm Masters.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Divine Martial Sect not only had Primal Realm Masters and Qi and Blood Realm Masters, but also the existence of True Meaning Realm Masters, which naturally filled Gu Yang with delight.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Martial Sect was now pledging their allegiance to him, and this force could be utilized for his own purposes.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was also well aware that with his current reputation and strength, he could not force the Divine Martial Sect to submit. Their true submission was due to the favor of his father.</p><p></p><p>An existence that could stand shoulder to shoulder with the Martial Ancestor from ten thousand years ago was more than enough to make the Divine Martial Sect willingly pledge their loyalty.</p>

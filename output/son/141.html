        <h1>Chapter 141</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master is as such.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng suspects that the Grand Master is also like this.</p><p></p><p>Since there are ordinary Masters and True Intent Masters, it is very likely that there are also ordinary Grand Masters and True Intent Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>Now.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has already attained the 9th level of True Intent, which is considered the pinnacle of True Intent Mastery.</p><p></p><p>If he continues to advance, he will likely be able to transform into a True Intent Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately.</p><p></p><p>The realization of True Intent.</p><p></p><p>Requires a certain opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was able to attain the True Intent of a Master previously because of a fortuitous opportunity, where he obtained the True Intent Diagram of a Master.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, even if one obtains the True Intent Diagram of a Master, truly grasping the Master's True Intent is not easy.</p><p></p><p>Just like Gu Yang, he has also realized the existence of the Tyrannical Saber Slash, and even gained some understanding of the True Intent of the Tyrannical Saber, but that level of True Intent has not yet truly entered the realm of Master's True Intent.</p><p></p><p>And Gu Qingfeng himself, after comprehending the True Intent of the Tyrannical Saber, was able to directly advance his Tyrannical Saber True Intent to the level of true Master's True Intent. He suspects this is related to his own cultivation, as well as the fact that he had previously grasped the True Intent of Killing.</p><p></p><p>Howeverâ€”</p><p></p><p>Now Gu Qingfeng has other ideas.</p><p></p><p>"With my current 9th level Tyrannical Saber True Intent, I should not be weaker than the powerful expert who left behind the Master's True Intent Diagram. That means I can also leave behind the Master's True Intent, for others to comprehend!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng suddenly realized that a True Intent Master represents not just supreme combat power, but also a tremendous opportunity for others in their faction.</p><p></p><p>After all.</p><p></p><p>Independently comprehending True Intent is extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>But if one can comprehend the True Intent left behind by predecessors, the difficulty would naturally be reduced.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>There is an obvious flaw in comprehending the True Intent of predecessors.</p><p></p><p>That is, the predecessor's True Intent is theirs, not one's own True Intent. Unless there is a natural affinity, it is difficult to cultivate to the same level as the predecessor, let alone surpass them.</p><p></p><p>Just like Gu Qingfeng himself.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the existence of the Attribute Panel, he would not have been able to cultivate the Tyrannical Saber True Intent to perfection.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Gu Qingfeng did not have this feeling.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>Since the Tyrannical Saber True Intent has been perfected, he realizes that it is as difficult as ascending to the heavens to truly cultivate the predecessor's True Intent to perfection.</p><p></p><p>With the existence of the Attribute Panel, this problem can now be ignored.</p><p></p><p>Not only can he cultivate to the level of his predecessors, he can even break through the limits on the basis of the predecessor's True Intent, and step into the 10th level of True Intent.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng suppressed this idea, and then looked back at the information panel.</p><p></p><p>The information about Gu Yang is still being updated, and it can be seen that many factions are unwilling to perish, and have launched attacks on the former.</p><p></p><p>However, there are several Grandmaster-level experts guarding him, and the Washing Marrow and Refining Filth realm cultivators pose no threat to them.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the many Washing Marrow and Refining Filth realm cultivators appearing on the information panel, Gu Qingfeng is not particularly moved.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when he was weak, these powerful experts seemed to be legendary existences, rare in the world.</p><p></p><p>But in fact.</p><p></p><p>This is only because at that time, he did not stand at the height he is at now, so naturally he could not have any interaction with these experts.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes:</p><p></p><p>A fierce tiger will never keep company with sheep.</p><p></p><p>One's own level determines the realm one can interact with.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng was at the White Stone Dao, he was only at the Refining Blood realm, so naturally he could only interact within the small world of the White Stone Dao.</p><p></p><p>It was not until later, when he stepped out of the White Stone Dao, that he...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gradually, he was able to access higher realms.</p><p></p><p>By now, not only was Gu Qingfeng renowned as a grand master, but Gu Yang also commanded tens of thousands of troops and had the identity of a grand master's direct descendant, naturally attracting many gazes.</p><p></p><p>This was why Gu Qingfeng directly handed the remaining two master-level cultivation pills to the secret guards.</p><p></p><p>Normally, Gu Qingfeng would have kept one or two master-level cultivation pills to cultivate others, or give them to Xu Yulan to help her break through the master realm and increase her lifespan.</p><p></p><p>But now, since it involved Gu Yang's safety, Gu Qingfeng had to first cultivate the forces around Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Yulan, she had already reached the perfect Wudu realm, with a lifespan of two hundred years, so there was no need to rush.</p><p></p><p>Two hundred years was more than enough time to wait for the next opportunity to obtain cultivation pills.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, once Gu Qingfeng succeeded in creating the perfect martial dao, he could also solve Xu Yulan's lifespan issue.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if he truly created the perfect martial dao, it would not only solve Xu Yulan's problem, but also the lifespan issues of all the Gu family's future generations.</p><p></p><p>The longer the Gu family's descendants lived, the more opportunities for Gu Qingfeng's own advancement.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Gu Qingfeng summoned a person.</p><p></p><p>The person wore a red robe, with eyebrows like willow leaves and a cold, stern countenance, like a solitary bloom in a frozen pond - untainted by the dust of the world, yet difficult to approach.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Your Highness!" The person spoke in a cool, distant voice, with a hint of reverence.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the Red Leaf before him, his heart unmoved. At his level, his pursuit was more focused on the martial dao, and he cared little for ordinary worldly matters.</p><p></p><p>"I will be going to the Demon-Subduing Prison next. You will stand guard over the Gu family manor, and if any evil spirits escape from the Demon-Subduing Prison, you must suppress them immediately!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Highness!" Red Leaf nodded.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, Gu Qingfeng left the Whetstone Hall and headed alone towards the Demon-Subduing Prison.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the Demon-Subduing Prison, Gu Qingfeng arrived at the place where evil spirits were sealed.</p><p></p><p>There were six golden coffins, each sealing an evil spirit.</p><p></p><p>Three of the golden coffins belonged to the three Fusion Realm elders from the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng left the Northern Gate Pass, Gu Yang had also instructed people to bring all three golden coffins back to the Demon-Subduing Prison for sealing.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was well aware of the grave importance of the evil spirits. If any of them were to escape, it could lead to a great deal of trouble. Perhaps even the emergence of an existence comparable to the Demonic Buddha of the Nine Twists.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, bringing the evil spirits back to the Demon-Subduing Prison was a necessary task.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the six golden coffins, Gu Qingfeng's eyes finally settled on one of them.</p><p></p><p>Sealed within was the Ominous Shadow.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect Refining of the Body!"</p><p>"Extreme Dao Master!"</p><p>"My current level of existence already surpasses that of ordinary martial artists, and even that of so-called sorcerers. Now, I shall see if I have the power to truly annihilate the evil spirits with my current level of existence!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured to himself, then directly broke the seal on the golden coffin. A terrifying, ominous and frigid aura suddenly burst forth, causing the temperature in the vast Demon-Subduing Prison to plummet.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

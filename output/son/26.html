        <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng asked.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang answered without hesitation, "Currently, there are 136 guards in the family, among them 60 are at the initial stage of skin refinement, 60 are at the intermediate stage, 9 are at the advanced stage, and 7 have reached the perfected stage!"</p><p></p><p>One hundred and thirty-six people. </p><p></p><p>This number is quite substantial.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered for a moment and said, "Yang'er, you should lead a portion of the guards to stay and protect the Gu family. Yulan is about to give birth, you need to take care of her more, and make sure no accidents happen."</p><p></p><p>"I understand, father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at Meng Peng and said, "You shall come with me to the Chu family."</p><p></p><p>"Master, are you going to directly head to the Chu family?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's brow furrowed slightly, "Is there a problem?"</p><p></p><p>"Currently, the ones who are against our Gu family are just some wandering jianghu figures. Although these people have the backing of the Chu family, the Chu family has not truly made a move. </p><p></p><p>If we directly go to the Chu family, we may be subject to criticism - "</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng expressed his concerns, as any matter should be handled properly.</p><p></p><p>If the Chu family truly made a move against the Gu family, then the Gu family's retaliation would be justified. </p><p></p><p>But now, the Chu family is hiding in the shadows, and there is no direct evidence. If we rashly make a move, it might put the Gu family in an unfavorable situation.</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng's words</p><p></p><p>made Gu Qingfeng shake his head and laugh, but the laughter looked ice-cold.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Peng, you are also an old hand in the jianghu, how can you still say such naive words?"</p><p></p><p>"The so-called 'proper cause' and 'righteous justification', those are things only the weak need. In the jianghu, the strong are respected, and what matters is whose fist is mightier.</p><p></p><p>The weak need to argue with reason, but the strong only need to wield their fists.</p><p></p><p>Today, even if we attack the Chu family directly, as long as our Gu family's fist is strong enough, who dares to say a word against us!"</p><p></p><p>As Gu Qingfeng spoke, a powerful aura began to emanate from him.</p><p></p><p>Under this overwhelming presence, both Gu Yang and Meng Peng felt as if two great mountains were pressing down on their shoulders, their hearts trembling.</p><p></p><p>"Father's strength has increased even more!"</p><p></p><p>Unlike Meng Peng's complete shock, Gu Yang's heart was filled with not only shock, but also deep admiration.</p><p></p><p>He had broken through to the perfected stage of skin refinement, thinking he could narrow the gap with Gu Qingfeng, but he realized his father's strength was still beyond his comprehension.</p><p></p><p>All along,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had always seen Gu Qingfeng as the backbone of the family.</p><p></p><p>The stronger his father became, the more delighted Gu Yang felt.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>On the street,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng led the Gu family's guards, marching in full force towards the Chu family.</p><p></p><p>This action immediately alerted many forces that had been secretly watching the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>there were also many wandering jianghu figures who observed this scene, their hearts filled with doubt and trepidation.</p><p></p><p>"Are those the Gu family's people?"</p><p></p><p>"The one leading them seems to be the Gu family's master. I've heard his unique fist technique is extraordinary, and he has slain many at the Blood Refining realm. This master who usually stays within the Gu family, why is he appearing here today?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't know? I've heard that in the past month, many of the Gu family's businesses have been attacked. This master's appearance is likely related to that matter..."</p><p></p><p>Along the way, many jianghu figures discussed in hushed tones, their expressions showing both reverence and deep apprehension towards Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng had not made many moves, the amount of blood he had shed was not small.</p><p></p><p>Now that Gu Qingfeng was personally taking action, it naturally shocked these jianghu figures.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>But very quickly.</p><p></p><p>These people soon discovered that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>Because they found that the direction Gu's family was heading was not towards other places, but straight towards the Chu family.</p><p></p><p>At the first moment.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Chu family, Chu Tianxiong had already received the news.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Qingfeng is leading the people of the Gu family to come directly over. Could it be that he really has the courage to tear off the mask?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Tianxiong's expression fluctuated, and then he had a Chu family member directly go to the Iron Bone Gang to inform Luo Yu of this news.</p><p></p><p>Then.</p><p></p><p>Chu Tianxiong proceeded to mobilize the Chu family warriors, preparing to welcome the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"Stop right there, this is the Chu family--"</p><p></p><p>In front of the Chu family manor, a guard was about to stop Gu Qingfeng, but before he could finish his words, Gu Qingfeng slapped him hard, the powerful strike instantly shattering the guard's head, sending his headless body flying.</p><p></p><p>This bloody scene left the remaining Chu family guards dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The other martial artists who had followed closely were also stunned on the spot.</p><p></p><p>No one had expected Gu Qingfeng to act so decisively and use violence so ruthlessly without any provocation.</p><p></p><p>When they saw the headless corpse on the ground, many people felt a chill down their spines.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Chu family manor.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took out a white cloth and slowly wiped the fresh blood from his hand, then casually tossed the blood-stained cloth onto the corpse, looking at the trembling Chu family guards with a cold voice, saying:</p><p></p><p>"Three breaths of time, let Chu Tianxiong come out to see me, or I will not leave a single chicken or dog in the Chu family!"</p><p></p><p>With these words spoken.</p><p></p><p>The Chu family guards hurriedly went to report.</p><p></p><p>In less than a moment.</p><p></p><p>Chu Tianxiong came with his people.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the headless corpse on the ground, Chu Tianxiong's pupils suddenly shrank, and the look he gave Gu Qingfeng was filled with rage.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Qingfeng, it's already unacceptable for you to bring people to my Chu family, and now you have even openly attacked and killed my Chu family guard. How do you explain this?"</p><p></p><p>"Explain?" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sneered.</p><p></p><p>"When your Chu family secretly sent people to sabotage and encroach on my Gu family's business, you should have anticipated such consequences."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Chu Tianxiong coldly laughed and said, "Everything requires evidence. You say my Chu family sent people to sabotage and encroach on your Gu family's business, do you have any evidence?"</p><p></p><p>"Evidence - my words, Gu Qingfeng's words, are the evidence!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stepped forward, suddenly unleashing a powerful punch towards Chu Tianxiong, the tremendous force erupting with a thunderous roar, the surging air waves causing Chu Tianxiong's expression to change.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you attack me!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Tianxiong was enraged, and the long sword behind him suddenly unsheathed, the dazzling sword light slashing through the air, turning into hundreds of afterimages in the blink of an eye, dazzling the onlookers.</p><p></p><p>This scene.</p><p></p><p>Made the surrounding people extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Tianxiong truly deserves the title of the 'Thunderous Sword', his sword techniques are truly extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Before the others could finish speaking, Gu Qingfeng's fist came crashing in, the sharp sword edge only leaving a white mark on his knuckle without actually piercing his flesh.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment.</p><p></p><p>The sword afterimages dissipated like bubbles.</p><p></p><p>Chu Tianxiong's expression changed drastically, hastily raising his sword to block, but Gu Qingfeng's fist came down, the long sword letting out a mournful cry before being cleaved in half, the unstoppable force slamming into Chu Tianxiong's chest, sending him flying backwards.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

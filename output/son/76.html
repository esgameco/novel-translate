        <h1>Chapter 76</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng tried to activate the true essence of killing that he had comprehended. In the depths, there was an invisible force of true essence power that descended upon the Sect Master's true essence diagram.</p><p></p><p>"Hum—"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Gu Qingfeng discovered that the Sect Master's true essence diagram seemed to have come alive.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, a tyrannical and unparalleled sword intent emerged from the Sect Master's true essence diagram. Gu Qingfeng seemed to see a terrifying divine sword descending from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Mountains and valleys collapsed. </p><p>The earth cracked.</p><p>The vast mountain range was directly shattered into two halves before that single sword.</p><p></p><p>A sword that cleaved the mountain! Terrifying to this extent! When witnessing this sword, Gu Qingfeng was completely dumbfounded. The true essence of killing that he had comprehended was like a flickering candle in the wind, insignificant and about to be extinguished before such a tyrannical and unparalleled sword intent.</p><p></p><p>It may have been just a moment. </p><p>Or it may have been a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng regained his senses, a sense of fatigue suddenly surged in his mind, as if his spiritual energy had been severely depleted.</p><p></p><p>However, that tyrannical and unparalleled sword intent had already been imprinted in his mind, impossible to forget.</p><p></p><p>"Tyrannical Sword Slash!"</p><p>"So this is the so-called Tyrannical Sword Slash—"</p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>Before witnessing the Sect Master's true essence, he had no way to truly understand the terrifying nature of such a Sect Master's true essence.</p><p></p><p>The true essence of killing that he had comprehended was pitifully small compared to the Sect Master's true essence.</p><p></p><p>Both were true essences, </p><p>but the former was ruthlessly crushed by the latter.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the day, </p><p>the true essence of killing was too weak.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, </p><p>the Tyrannical Sword Slash that Gu Yang had comprehended was far inferior to the Tyrannical Sword Slash within the Sect Master's true essence diagram.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Yang had mastered such a level of Tyrannical Sword Slash, Gu Qingfeng suspected that even a cultivator who had attained Bone Refining Perfection might not be able to defeat him.</p><p></p><p>"Bone Refining cultivators are called minor Sect Masters!"</p><p>"In my opinion, only Bone Refining cultivators who have mastered true essence can truly be called minor Sect Masters—"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the Sect Master's true essence diagram in front of him, and his understanding of true essence had deepened.</p><p></p><p>Mastering true essence or not </p><p>was a completely different concept.</p><p></p><p>As fellow Bone Refining cultivators, the former who had mastered true essence could easily suppress the latter who had not.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had already grasped the method of comprehending the Sect Master's true essence diagram.</p><p></p><p>To comprehend the Sect Master's true essence diagram, </p><p>one must either rely on one's own insights, </p><p>or use true essence to stimulate the true essence within it.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, </p><p>Gu Yang belonged to the former.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's own insights were slightly lacking, so he adopted the latter method.</p><p></p><p>With his current comprehension progress, Gu Qingfeng believed that he could initially comprehend the Tyrannical Sword Slash in less than a month.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that each comprehension of true essence would greatly deplete his spiritual power, his comprehension progress could have been even faster.</p><p></p><p>The following time was much simpler.</p><p></p><p>In addition to cultivating the Qingyang Technique and the Five Viscera Classic, Gu Qingfeng had one more task to do every day, which was to comprehend the Sect Master's true essence diagram.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, </p><p>Permit Yulian used the Breakthrough Pill to break through, and combined with the cultivation of the Scorching Sun Divine Palm, she also successfully cultivated the Scorching Sun Palm Strength to perfection.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the Scorching Sun Palm Strength, </p><p>even if she did not continue to cultivate in the future, she could slowly cultivate an iron-like physique and advance to the Bone Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, </p><p>Gu Qingfeng also paid attention to the news of the Taishan Dao every few days.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>News had reached Gu Qingfeng's hands.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the struggle for control over the Taishan Road had entered a critical stage.</p><p></p><p>The Zhuo family, in order to completely occupy the Taishan Road, had not only mobilized several Xishou-realm warriors, but even three Yuling-realm sorcerers had stepped out.</p><p></p><p>The remaining sects and aristocratic families were also unwilling to back down.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the Taishan Road had fallen into complete chaos.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The Zhuo family's strength is indeed formidable. To contend for a single Taishan Road, they can mobilize three Yuling-realm sorcerers and five Xishou-realm warriors. It's no wonder the Zhuo family has the confidence to occupy the Taishan Road!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the intelligence in his hand and smiled calmly.</p><p></p><p>He did not doubt the Zhuo family's strength. After all, over a thousand years, it would be impossible for them not to have any foundation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng said, "Although the Zhuo family has many powerful experts, the other aristocratic families and sects are also not weak. I've heard that the Shangguan family, the Guanxing Sect, the Chiyan Sect, and the Hungu Sect all have experts who have entered the Taishan Road.</p><p></p><p>The Zhuo family, relying solely on their own forces, may not have a high chance of success in dealing with the numerous aristocratic families and sects."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Gu Peng's expression was filled with a sense of awe.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when he was a wandering cultivator, he had only mingled at the bottom, completely unaware of the true depth of the jianghu world.</p><p></p><p>Until now, by Gu Qingfeng's side, Gu Peng finally truly experienced the true face of the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the fierce competition between the major sects and aristocratic families, the previous conflicts could only be considered minor skirmishes.</p><p></p><p>According to Gu Peng's understanding, this time, there were no less than a dozen Xishou-realm warriors who had appeared.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that in the previous White Stone Road, there was not even a single Lianggu-realm warrior.</p><p></p><p>Only by truly understanding the depth of the jianghu could one comprehend one's own insignificance.</p><p></p><p>"Whether the Zhuo family can win or not is a small matter. As long as it does not affect my Gu family manor, that is all that matters," Gu Qingfeng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng's expression became solemn. "In these past few days, there have also been many unfamiliar warriors appearing in the White Stone Road, stirring up a lot of turmoil. Some of these warriors have come from the Taishan Road, while others are related to other sects and aristocratic families. </p><p></p><p>Regarding this matter, what plans does the lord have?"</p><p></p><p>"Defend against the soldiers when they come, and cover up with the earth when the water comes!" Gu Qingfeng's eyes grew cold, and then he looked at Gu Peng in front of him and said, "Your current Lianhuo initial realm cultivation is a bit weak. I happened to obtain a Breakthrough Elixir. For cultivators below the Lianggu realm, taking it will have an effect. You can take it later to break through the Lianhuo Perfection realm. I believe it will not be a problem."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Gu Qingfeng handed the remaining three Breakthrough Elixirs to Gu Peng.</p><p></p><p>The Breakthrough Elixir was only effective for cultivators below the Lianggu realm. Xu Yulan had already reached the Lianhuo Perfection realm, so taking the Breakthrough Elixir would have no effect on her. As for Gu Yang, Gu Qingfeng had no intention of letting him take a shortcut.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the most suitable person to take the Breakthrough Elixir was Gu Peng.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng had been by his side for many years, and Gu Qingfeng trusted him greatly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the situation in the White Stone Road was currently tense. The Gu family manor needed to have some powerful experts to stabilize the situation.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Peng could break through to the Lianhuo Perfection realm, even if it did not bring a great effect, at least it would have a certain deterrent effect.</p><p></p><p>"Your subordinate is grateful to the lord!" Gu Peng gripped the bottle containing the Breakthrough Elixir, and the excitement on his face was difficult to suppress.</p><p></p><p>Lianhuo Perfection. This was something he had never dared to dream of before. After all, Gu Peng was well aware of his own talent, and breaking through the Lianhuo realm was about his limit. Without any other opportunities, it would be impossible for him to advance further.</p><p></p><p>Now that Gu Qingfeng had bestowed such an opportunity, how could he not be excited.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

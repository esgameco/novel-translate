        <h1>Chapter 176</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been resting and focusing on the study of the martial dao, and his cultivation has improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has been guided by a Sect Master-level martial artist, and his cultivation has improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has been guided by a Sect Master-level martial artist, and his cultivation has improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Shengnan' has been enlightened by a Sect Master-level martial artist on the Yijing, and her aptitude has improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Shengnan' has been refining her physique with innate true qi for a long time, her qi and blood are abundant, and she has passively entered the martial dao, breaking through the initial stage of skin refinement!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 1 Upgrade Point!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng, who was in seclusion in the Whetstone Hall, saw the content on the information panel and his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he left the Whetstone Hall and went to the inner courtyard.</p><p></p><p>There, he saw Gu Shengnan being held in Xu Yulan's arms, and Zhong Li's expression was one of both joy and concern.</p><p></p><p>When they saw Gu Qingfeng arrive, both of them were startled.</p><p></p><p>"Husband (Father)!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng waved his hand, and his gaze was fixed on Gu Shengnan the entire time.</p><p></p><p>The two-year-old infant had a round, chubby little face, making one have the urge to pinch her cheeks.</p><p></p><p>However, what Gu Qingfeng was concerned about was not these superficial details, but the powerful qi and blood force within her that was not normal for an infant.</p><p></p><p>Entering the martial dao!</p><p></p><p>This was something Gu Qingfeng had not expected.</p><p></p><p>After all, for normal children to cultivate the martial dao, they would need to be at least six or seven years old, when their foundation is somewhat stable, before they can begin cultivation.</p><p></p><p>If they are too young, hastily cultivating the martial dao can easily lead to problems.</p><p></p><p>Because infants are physically weak, how can they bear the power of the martial dao's qi and blood?</p><p></p><p>So, the moment Gu Qingfeng saw Gu Shengnan, he grasped her small hand and probed her condition with a trace of true qi.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Gu Qingfeng's expression eased somewhat.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Xu Yulan's expression was also slightly tense: "Husband, is Shengnan alright?"</p><p></p><p>To be honest, when they saw Gu Shengnan cross the threshold of the martial dao and cultivate the martial dao's qi and blood, Xu Yulan was also somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Qingfeng shook his head: "The problem is not serious. Although her qi and blood are abundant, her meridians and bones are also different from ordinary people. And this qi and blood power will gradually and imperceptibly transform her. If nurtured over the years, it will bring great benefits."</p><p></p><p>"Now it seems that nourishing herself with innate true qi is also quite beneficial for an infant, but Shengnan is still too young to truly cultivate the martial dao. After all, the tempering of the martial dao, if practiced without sufficient age, will only harm oneself. But if she only nurtures herself with innate true qi, there is no major problem."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Gu Qingfeng's words, Xu Yulan and Zhong Li both visibly relaxed.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, Gu Qingfeng was also somewhat surprised by Gu Shengnan's current situation.</p><p></p><p>After all, the foundation of the Gu Clan Manor is ultimately weak, not like those immortal sects and noble families that have a thousand-year heritage, where many things and experiences have been painstakingly explored by their ancestors and then inherited and perfected by later generations.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, the Gu Clan Manor is not on par with these immortal sects in this regard.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng has also indirectly confirmed one thing:</p><p></p><p>The reason why those immortal sects can endure for a long time is that they can continuously cultivate enough powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>Nourishing the physique with innate true qi, even those with mediocre aptitude can be forcibly transformed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was just a casual remark.</p><p></p><p>Who among the ordinary forces would be able to make a Xiantian Sect Master not care about the cost and change the innate physical constitution of others?</p><p></p><p>"Come!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng suddenly shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after,</p><p></p><p>Three people suddenly appeared and respectfully saluted Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Your Highness!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yulan, who was standing by, had a slight change of expression on her pretty face when she saw the three suddenly appearing people.</p><p></p><p>With her current realm and eyesight, she could naturally see that the three were all Xiantian Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>"Red Leaf, Snatch Soul, and Chase Soul, these three are the attendants of my Gu Family Manor, and they are also Xiantian Sect Master realm warriors," </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng, seeing the shock and confusion on Xu Yulan and Zhong Li's faces, explained.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>He looked at the three and said, "In the coming period, you will take turns to use your Xiantian true qi to cleanse Shengnan's innate constitution."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Red Leaf and the other two heard this and responded calmly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not say anything more.</p><p></p><p>Since he knew that Xiantian true qi could not only change the innate physical constitution of an infant, but also allow them to take the first step on the martial path in advance, laying a solid foundation for the future, Gu Qingfeng naturally would not waste this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Xu Yulan's strength alone is limited.</p><p></p><p>After all, the other party not only cleanses Gu Shengnan's innate constitution, but sometimes also regulates Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu. Even if the Xiantian Sect Masters' true qi is extremely powerful, it cannot withstand such consumption.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately,</p><p></p><p>Red Leaf and the others are all Xiantian Sect Masters, so Gu Qingfeng naturally would not waste them.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the relationship with the several Xiantian Sect Master attendants was of great importance, and Gu Qingfeng would not easily expose it.</p><p></p><p>But now,</p><p></p><p>even if the news that the Gu Family Manor has a few more Xiantian Sect Masters spreads, it would not matter much.</p><p></p><p>Or rather,</p><p></p><p>at Gu Qingfeng's current level, many things are no longer worth worrying about too much. Even if others know that the Gu Family Manor has secrets, they dare not have any ideas.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p></p><p>in this world, it is ultimately strength that speaks.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also wants to see what kind of amazing performance Gu Shengnan will have when he starts cultivating the martial path after being tempered by Xiantian true qi from a young age.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng returned to the Grinding Knife Hall.</p><p></p><p>Most of his time now is spent in comprehending and deducing the Longevity Sutra, wanting to create the Bone Refining Chapter. If it were not for Gu Shengnan's matter, Gu Qingfeng would not have come out of seclusion directly.</p><p></p><p>As the only heir of the third generation of the Gu Family, Gu Qingfeng naturally cares about it to some extent.</p><p></p><p>"But the bloodline of the Gu Family is still a bit lacking. It's time to let Almond have more bloodline descendants for the Gu Family!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng mused.</p><p></p><p>At his level of cultivation, leaving behind descendants is no easier than ascending to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>what he himself has not been able to do, Gu Qingfeng has placed his hopes on people like Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu are too young, and only Gu Yang is the most suitable.</p><p></p><p>If the third generation of the Gu Family's bloodline population increases greatly, then strengthening himself would be a matter of minutes.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also took a look at the information panel.</p><p></p><p>After Gu Yang unified the entire Taishan Prefecture, the refresh rate of the information panel has decreased a lot.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had originally thought that Gu Yang's occupation of the entire Taishan Prefecture would achieve some accomplishments, but the information panel did not have much movement, which made his idea fall through.

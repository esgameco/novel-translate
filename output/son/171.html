        <h1>Chapter 171</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After taking a look at his own attribute panel, Gu Qingfeng felt as if he had cultivated and studied the Scripture of the Fist of the Sun and Moon for hundreds of years, and a powerful true intent had risen from within him.</p><p></p><p>The fist like the sun and moon!</p><p>Illuminating the vast sky!</p><p></p><p>As this true intent spread out, all the people in the Gu Family Village seemed to sense something, vaguely seeing the mysterious scene of the sun and moon in the sky.</p><p></p><p>But this scene appeared and disappeared quickly.</p><p></p><p>Only a few innate grand masters like Gu Peng could understand what this commotion was all about.</p><p></p><p>"My husband's strength has grown even stronger!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yulan's beautiful eyes flickered as she looked towards the direction of the Grinding Knife Hall. At this point, she had also become an innate grand master at the peak level.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, before this, Xu Yulan had never thought that she would one day be able to break through to the level of an innate grand master.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even breaking through to the Blood Refining Realm would have been considered the limit for her.</p><p></p><p>But after the battle in Guangyang Prefecture, Xu Yulan realized that the depth of her husband Gu Qingfeng's foundation was truly unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>The only pity was that Gu Qingfeng now spent most of his time in the Grinding Knife Hall, rarely coming out. But whenever he did, Xu Yulan would do her utmost to please him.</p><p></p><p>In her spare time, she also studied the martial arts diligently, not wanting to become a burden to Gu Qingfeng as his strength continued to grow, and as the influence of Gu Yang, the King of Guangyang, increased, the Gu Family Village would surely face more troubles. As Gu Qingfeng's wife, she too would become a target.</p><p></p><p>In Xu Yulan's view, this was also a major reason why Gu Qingfeng had directly helped her break through to the level of an innate grand master.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Xu Yulan naturally did not want to disappoint Gu Qingfeng's expectations. She also guided the cultivation of Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu, using her innate true qi to help them refine their meridians and marrow occasionally, although the effects were not very strong, but over time, it would still be of some use.</p><p></p><p>"The Scripture of the Fist of the Sun and Moon, if cultivated to perfection, will not be inferior to the Tyrannical Saber Slash!" </p><p></p><p>"However, the true intent within me is somewhat mixed, like the intent of the Fist of the Sun and Moon and the Tyrannical Saber Intent. If I can fuse them together, I believe I can unleash even greater power!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng mused. </p><p></p><p>However, fusing true intents was just a sudden inspiration of Gu Qingfeng's, and with his current understanding of the Dao of martial arts, he had not yet reached the level to truly accomplish that.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, the information panel had new text updates.</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has broken through to the initial Blood Refining Realm!"</p><p>"Reward: +20 Attribute Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has broken through to the initial Blood Refining Realm!"</p><p>"Reward: +20 Attribute Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Xuan and Xiu have finally broken through as well!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled slightly. To be honest, it hadn't been too long since Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu had broken through to the Blood Refining Realm, so they shouldn't have been able to break through this quickly.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about how Xu Yulan had been using her innate true qi to help them refine their meridians and marrow, Gu Qingfeng felt at ease.</p><p></p><p>With the help of an innate grand master, breaking through the Blood Refining Realm was an easy task.</p><p></p><p>After all, for an innate grand master, the so-called Blood Refining and Skin Refining realms were just minor matters. Helping them improve these two realms would not pose much of a problem.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Though he was a renowned Xiantian Master, he would not waste his true qi to help ordinary martial artists in their cultivation and breakthroughs. </p><p></p><p>After all, at the Xiantian Master level, the next step would be to break through to the Great Master realm. Every bit of true qi accumulated could be a chance for him to eventually break through to the Great Master level.</p><p></p><p>Carelessly depleting true qi was not a good thing.</p><p></p><p>However, this was not an issue for Xu Yulan. Given her natural talent, she might not even be able to break through the Refine Bone realm normally, yet she had managed to break through to the peak of the Xiantian Master realm using medicinal pills. This had already exceeded her limits.</p><p></p><p>Going forward, unless she obtained an even higher-grade direct promotion pill, with Xu Yulan's talent, she would be stuck at the Xiantian Master realm for the rest of her life.</p><p></p><p>Since breaking through to the Great Master realm was hopeless, there was no need to accumulate a reserve of true qi.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the extra forty advancement points, combined with the remaining thirteen points, Gu Qingfeng had just enough to break through the Dayue Fist Classic.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Gu Qingfeng immediately spent fifty advancement points to cultivate the Dayue Fist Classic to the Mastery stage.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The Dayue Fist Classic had broken through.</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura erupted from Gu Qingfeng, shaking the entire Grinding Pavilion. The many divine weapons trembled as they sensed this intent.</p><p></p><p>After a while, this true essence gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>"Dayue Fist Classic has reached Mastery!"</p><p>"Dayue True Intent has reached the eighth level!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>For an ordinary person to cultivate to this level would require hundreds of years of arduous cultivation. Sect Master's supreme skills were simply too difficult to master.</p><p></p><p>Even for a Qi and Blood Sect Master, their lifespan was only about five hundred years. Xiantian Masters had an even shorter lifespan of only three hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, many Sect Masters would find it extremely difficult to cultivate a Sect Master's supreme skill to the Mastery stage in their lifetime.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was rare for them to even truly grasp the Sect Master's true intent, let alone reach the Mastery stage.</p><p></p><p>This was why true intent Sect Masters were so few in number.</p><p></p><p>However, with his Attribute Panel, Gu Qingfeng was able to save a lot of effort.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Leaving the Grinding Pavilion, Gu Qingfeng went to the backyard and saw Xu Yulan guiding Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu in their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Husband!"</p><p>"Father..."</p><p></p><p>The three were delighted to see Gu Qingfeng arrive. However, Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu's expressions also held a hint of awe and restraint. After all, Gu Qingfeng was known for his strict personality, and the pressure of his attributes made them dare not act rashly.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, you've broken through to the Refine Blood realm so quickly!" Gu Qingfeng looked at the two, his face revealing a faint smile as he praised and affirmed their achievements.</p><p></p><p>To reach the Refine Blood realm before the age of eight was considered a prodigy in the martial world. Despite being under eight years old, their physiques were already quite robust, not much different from teenagers.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng handed a secret manual to Xu Yulan.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Longevity Sutra I created during my recent seclusion in the Grinding Pavilion. Although it only covers the Refine Blood chapter for now, cultivating it can still increase your lifespan to a certain extent and enhance your strength. You can study it in your free time, and then teach Xuan'er and Xiu'er to practice it as well."</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

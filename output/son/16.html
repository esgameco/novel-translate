        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was soon.</p><p></p><p>Other people also arrived one after another.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng quietly watched the auction stage, waiting for the auction to begin.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't long before.</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged man in elegant attire appeared in Gu Qingfeng's line of sight, whom he also recognized as a manager of the Cloud Pavilion, named Jing Ping.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>This person was also a master who had reached the half-step Blood Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>The so-called half-step Blood Refining.</p><p></p><p>It was a realm that Gu Qingfeng came to understand after arriving at the White Stone Path. </p><p></p><p>This realm, strictly speaking, also belongs to the category of Skin Refining Perfection, but it has stepped forward half a step on the basis of Skin Refining Perfection, without truly entering the Blood Refining realm, and is therefore called the half-step Blood Refining.</p><p></p><p>The biggest difference between the Blood Refining realm and the Skin Refining realm is whether the qi and blood have undergone a transformation.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists in the Skin Refining realm have no significant difference in their qi and blood compared to ordinary people, but when they enter the Blood Refining realm, their qi and blood undergo a transformation, becoming an extremely rigid and yang force, and the martial artists' strength also increases significantly.</p><p></p><p>Even in the White Stone Path, martial artists who can reach the half-step Blood Refining realm are of no low status.</p><p></p><p>Now that a manager of the Cloud Pavilion in the White Stone Path has reached the half-step Blood Refining realm, the overall strength of the Cloud Pavilion can be imagined.</p><p></p><p>At this time.</p><p></p><p>The auction had already begun.</p><p></p><p>A maid brought out a brocade box, and Jing Ping opened it, revealing a long sword, the hilt of which was carved with dragon patterns, and the blade was entirely white, emitting a dazzling cold light, truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"This is a top-tier low-grade divine weapon, the Icy Moon Sword, its material is forged from pure iron and blood copper, extremely sharp. The starting bid is one thousand taels of silver, and each subsequent bid must be no less than fifty taels!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Jing Ping's words fell, there were quickly people bidding.</p><p></p><p>For a top-tier low-grade divine weapon, it can play a certain role for most Blood Refining realm martial artists.</p><p></p><p>So in a short time, the Icy Moon Sword had soared to one thousand five hundred taels of silver.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng just watched, without the intention of competing in the bidding.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that he did not cultivate the sword art, even if he had the Icy Moon Sword in his hands, it would not be of much use to him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's body defense now is comparable to that of a Blood Refining realm martial artist, and his bare hands, with the unbreakable nature of the Gu Family Fist, are even comparable to divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>So to speak, the Icy Moon Sword is not as useful as his bare hands.</p><p></p><p>Such a treasure.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng naturally did not value it.</p><p></p><p>At this time.</p><p></p><p>Qiushui beside him said softly, "I heard that the Icy Moon Sword is from the famous Sword Mountain Villa. Does Master Gu not have any thoughts on such a treasure?"</p><p></p><p>"If it were a mid-grade divine weapon, it would be nice, but alas, a low-grade divine weapon is still lacking in some ways."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The maid's eyes were clearly a little gloomy.</p><p></p><p>For them, the more the guests traded here, the more commission they could get, so Qiushui naturally hoped that Gu Qingfeng would take the Icy Moon Sword.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>For such a patriarch of a prominent family, once a decision is made, it is not easy for others to sway him, let alone a small maid like herself.</p><p></p><p>Talking too much will only lead to loss.</p><p></p><p>This principle.</p><p></p><p>Qiushui understood well.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng's words fell, Qiushui no longer spoke, only diligently serving Gu Qingfeng, refilling his tea and water.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the bidding for the Icy Moon Sword was still ongoing, and in less than a moment, the price of this divine weapon had soared to two thousand taels.</p><p></p><p>At this price, there were not many people still competing.</p><p></p><p>In the end.</p><p></p><p>The Icy Moon Sword was sold to a martial artist for two thousand two hundred taels of silver.</p><p></p><p>The auction of the Icy Moon Sword ended, and the entire auction...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere in the auction hall had been stirred up, and one item after another began to be auctioned off. These items were either divine weapons and tools, or elixirs and medicinal pills. Some of them could even be of help to cultivators at the Blood Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>For example, a medicinal pill called the Nourishing Blood Pill appeared in the auction. Cultivators at the Blood Refining Realm could consume it to nourish their qi and blood, and enhance their cultivation base. When this pill was brought out, many Blood Refining Realm cultivators competed fiercely to acquire it. However, Gu Qingfeng simply snorted at it.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Qingfeng had consumed the Nourishing Blood Pill before, and it was vastly inferior to the Refining Blood Pill.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng did not completely abstain from bidding. He bought some medicinal pills or herbs that were needed for cultivators at the Skin Refining Realm, but he did not need them for himself. He was preparing them for Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and one item after another was auctioned off, until the auction was nearing its end.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ping took out a golden embroidered jewelry box, and all eyes were fixed on it, their gazes burning with intensity.</p><p></p><p>"I believe that the majority of you here today have come for this item, so Jiang will not waste any more words!" </p><p></p><p>"The Scorching Sun Divine Palm!"</p><p></p><p>"A top-tier intermediate martial art. If cultivated to perfection, it can allow one to reach the peak of the Blood Refining Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The starting bid for this martial art is 10,000 taels of silver, and each subsequent bid must be no less than 100 taels."</p><p></p><p>"I bid 20,000 taels!"</p><p></p><p>"30,000 taels!"</p><p></p><p>"40,000 taels..."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Jiang Ping finished speaking, the price of the Scorching Sun Divine Palm skyrocketed, directly surpassing 50,000 taels of silver.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew how powerful a top-tier intermediate martial art could be. The top sects of the White Stone Dao essentially controlled such martial arts. If one could obtain it, their family's power could potentially dominate the White Stone Dao.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, it would significantly advance their own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It was no exaggeration to say that 90% of the cultivators who had come to the Cloud Tower were here for this intermediate martial art.</p><p></p><p>Listening to the price continuously rising, it had already exceeded 100,000 taels in the blink of an eye. Gu Qingfeng furrowed his brows and asked Meng Peng beside him, "How much silver did we bring with us this time?"</p><p></p><p>"We only brought around 120,000 taels. The family head used 10,000 taels for the previous auction, so we now have about 110,000 taels left."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked back towards the auction stage. With only 110,000 taels, it seemed highly unlikely that they could obtain the Scorching Sun Divine Palm.</p><p></p><p>This was simply due to the Gu family's shallow foundations. In the span of two to three years, being able to bring out over 100,000 taels was already their limit.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, Gu Qingfeng still placed a bid. But the 110,000 taels was quickly surpassed by others.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Qingfeng gave up on competing for the Scorching Sun Divine Palm. He signaled to Meng Peng, who then quietly left the VIP room after Gu Qingfeng whispered a few words to him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng then calmly watched the auction proceed.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Scorching Sun Divine Palm was sold for 200,000 taels of silver.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

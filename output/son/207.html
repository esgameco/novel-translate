        <h1>Chapter 207</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Master was slightly stunned for a moment, but after recognizing the identity of the visitor, he hurriedly stood up and paid his respects.</p><p></p><p>Fu Zhao!</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Elder of the Taisuzu Sect.</p><p></p><p>He was also the only cultivator in the Taisuzu Sect who had reached the half-step Penetrating Divinity Realm.</p><p></p><p>Howeverâ€”</p><p></p><p>Looking at the now emerged Fu Zhao, the Taixuan Master seemed to have thought of something, and his expression became somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Elder, have you broken through to the Penetrating Divinity Realm now that you have emerged from seclusion?"</p><p></p><p>Penetrating Divinity Realm! Hearing these three words, the other sect elders also had heated expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Fu Zhao's expression was calm: "It is all thanks to the Sect Master bringing me the corpse of a True Meaning Grand Master, otherwise, it would have taken me at least ten years to break through to the Penetrating Divinity Realm!"</p><p></p><p>He was only half a step away from the Penetrating Divinity Realm, but that half-step had eluded Fu Zhao for many years.</p><p></p><p>Until recently.</p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Master had brought back the corpse of a True Meaning Grand Master, and Fu Zhao was able to use it to successfully break through.</p><p></p><p>The Jia Imperial House had fallen, and all the Grand Masters had perished. The corpses of such powerful cultivators were naturally coveted by various factions.</p><p></p><p>However, the Taixuan Master's strength was not weak, and he had forcibly snatched the corpse of the True Meaning Grand Master from the hands of many powers.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, as Fu Zhao himself said, without this True Meaning Grand Master's corpse, it would have taken him at least ten years to break through to the Penetrating Divinity Realm.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the affirmative answer, the Taixuan Master was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Elder's ascension to the Penetrating Divinity Realm is an unprecedented event for the Taisuzu Sect."</p><p></p><p>"There is no need to say more about this. How is the situation in the Central Continent now?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Zhao waved his hand and directly entered the main topic.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Taixuan Master's smile disappeared, and he said in a serious tone, "To report to the Supreme Elder, since the fall of the Jia Imperial House, the Sword King supported by the Shengjian Sect has suppressed the various powers, and the vassals we Taisuzu Sect supported have been retreating one after another.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the Central Continent is likely to fall into the hands of the Shengjian Sect.</p><p></p><p>I think the Sword King is now at the peak of his power, and we can have the Ling King temporarily withdraw from Lingzhou to regroup his troops and fight the Sword King again!"</p><p></p><p>"There is no need to be so troublesome. The various sects supporting different vassals to fight for the Nine Provinces is because the powers are roughly equal. If they truly tear off the mask, the result will only be mutual destruction.</p><p></p><p>But now that I have broken through to the Penetrating Divinity Realm, I am the only one in the world who has reached this realm. The Taisuzu Sect naturally has the qualifications to dominate the world!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Zhao interrupted the Taixuan Master's words with a domineering tone and expression.</p><p></p><p>His words made the Taixuan Master's heart tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Does the Supreme Elder intend to take action personally?"</p><p></p><p>"Why not?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Zhao's words made the Taixuan Master understand.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, as Fu Zhao said, the various sects did not truly participate in the struggle for the world, but only secretly supported one faction to dominate the world, because they did not want to tear off the mask and risk mutual destruction.</p><p></p><p>But now, with a cultivator at the Penetrating Divinity Realm emerging from the Taisuzu Sect, there was no need to abide by the previous rules.</p><p></p><p>If the immortal sects and families were the forces that formulated the rules, then cultivators at the Penetrating Divinity Realm were the ones who could break the rules.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the Taisuzu Sect no longer needed to follow many of the rules.</p><p></p><p>The next three thousand years would ultimately belong to the Taisuzu Sect.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, a smile appeared on the Taixuan Master's face: "The Supreme Elder's words are correct, I was a bit misguided in this matter. What does the Supreme Elder plan to do next?"</p><p></p><p>"I will personally go to the Central Continent and eliminate all the rebels. If they are sensible, perhaps I can allow their dao lineage to continue. Otherwise, these forces will have no reason to exist!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Zhao said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the Penetrating Divinity Realm, the Nine Provinces seemed to be completely under his control.</p><p></p><p>At this level of power, it was completely incomparable to the Transformation Realm and the Martial Dao Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>As long as he wanted to, he could suppress everything.</p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Master nodded: "The Supreme Elder's plan has the sect's full support."</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Taixuan Master's expression became more serious.</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Elder may not know, but a figure who seems to rival the Martial Ancestor from thousands of years ago has emerged from Qingyun State in recent years.</p><p></p><p>This person slew the ancient Yutianjian and destroyed the Tianyang Sword Sect, and can be considered the number one martial artist in the world today. When the Taixuan Dynasty had not yet fallen, he was even enfeoffed as the Martial Saint.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Elder needs to be careful about this person!"</p><p></p><p>"The number one martial artist in the world?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Zhao was also taken aback. He had been in seclusion for many years and was not very familiar with the affairs of the jianghu, so naturally he did not know about the existence of Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>It was not until the Taixuan Master mentioned it that Fu Zhao realized that there had been another powerful figure emerge in the world during the years he was in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Fu Zhao coldly smiled: "What if he rivals the Martial Ancestor from thousands of years ago? Rumor has it that the Martial Ancestor's martial arts had already broken through the limits of the Martial Dao Grand Masters, entering a realm that is profoundly mysterious.</p><p></p><p>But now that I have entered the Penetrating Divinity Realm, even if the Martial Ancestor were to be reborn, I might not necessarily be unable to deal with him.</p><p></p><p>A junior like him, no matter how monstrous his natural talent, how much of a storm could he possibly stir up!"</p><p></p><p>Upon learning of Gu Qingfeng's existence, a killing intent had already arisen in Fu Zhao's heart.</p><p></p><p>Although he spoke disdainfully of Gu Qingfeng, the fact that the latter could reach such a level in martial arts in just a few decades was truly monstrous and extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Such a person, Fu Zhao would not let live.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Guangyang Army that Gu Qingfeng supported now ruled an entire state.</p><p></p><p>If the Taisuzu Sect wanted to unify the Nine Provinces, Qingyun State would be an obstacle that could not be bypassed.</p><p></p><p>Fu Zhao said, "After I have dealt with the affairs in the Central Continent, I will naturally go to Qingyun State as well. This world is not for a mere martial artist to run rampant!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Guangyang Royal Palace, in the back garden, Gu Yang, dressed in a purple dragon robe, had a resolute countenance that had lost the youthful innocence of the past, replaced by a steady and majestic bearing.</p><p></p><p>He calmly looked at the pond in front of him, where dozens of colorful koi were swimming happily, and the lotus flowers in the pond were also in full bloom, swaying gently in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Behind Gu Yang, Gu Yi, dressed in battle gear, stood there respectfully and reported the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, a spy from Lingzhou has reported that the Supreme Elder of the Taisuzu Sect, Fu Zhao, has emerged from seclusion and is heading towards the Central Continent."</p><p></p><p>"Fu Zhao?" </p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression changed slightly when he heard this name.</p><p></p><p>"I remember that the Taisuzu Sect has a cultivator who has been in seclusion for many years and is rumored to have reached the half-step Penetrating Divinity Realm, could this be the same person?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Yi nodded.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang's brow furrowed. "Fu Zhao has been in seclusion for many years, with the goal of breaking through to the Penetrating Divinity Realm. Now that he has emerged, could it be that he has succeeded in his breakthrough?"</p><p></p><p>"Whether Fu Zhao has truly broken through to the Penetrating Divinity Realm is something we do not know for certain. For such a powerful cultivator, even our spies are unable to gather much information."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi responded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was not angry about this.</p><p></p><p>After all, while the spymaster's methods were good, they were still unable to infiltrate the Taisuzu Sect to that extent.</p><p></p><p>When it came to the secrets of the Sect's Supreme Elder, there was little chance of obtaining such information.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, it is very likely that he has indeed reached the Penetrating Divinity Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression became more serious.</p><p></p><p>He had not personally witnessed the terrifying power of the Penetrating Divinity Realm, but he had gathered some intelligence about this realm.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the Jia Imperial House of Xianzhou had produced a Penetrating Divinity Realm cultivator who had suppressed the Nine Provinces, making the immortal sects and families unable to raise their heads.</p><p></p><p>Until that Penetrating Divinity Realm cultivator of the Jia Imperial House passed away, the various sects had a chance to catch their breath.</p><p></p><p>But even so, in the hundreds of years since that Penetrating Divinity Realm cultivator's demise, no faction had dared to target the Jia Imperial House.</p><p></p><p>This was the might of the Penetrating Divinity Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even after their death, the lingering aura could suppress the world for hundreds of years, making other powers dare not act rashly.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Taisuzu Sect was suspected of producing another Penetrating Divinity Realm cultivator, the consequences of which were unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Yang's view, Fu Zhao's trip to the Central Continent was likely to put an end to the chaos there.</p><p></p><p>With a Penetrating Divinity Realm cultivator personally taking action, the other powers had no chance of resistance.</p><p></p><p>At that point, the Central Continent would undoubtedly fall into the hands of the Taisuzu Sect.</p><p></p><p>And when that happened, the next target would most likely be Qingyun State.</p><p></p><p>"The Penetrating Divinity Realm... the existence at this level is truly capable of changing the pattern of the world!"</p><p></p><p>If it were solely relying on the current strength of the Guangyang Army, to be honest, Gu Yang did not have absolute confidence in confronting a Penetrating Divinity Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>However, not having absolute confidence in confrontation did not mean he would passively allow the other party to control the situation.</p><p></p><p>After all, over the years, Gu Yang had also been quietly developing his forces, and the power he now commanded was no longer comparable to the past.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had Gu Qingfeng backing him up.</p><p></p><p>Regarding his father's strength, even with Gu Yang's current perspective, there was still a lot of mystery.</p><p></p><p>But one thing Gu Yang was certain of was that Gu Qingfeng's strength was not necessarily weaker than that Penetrating Divinity Realm cultivator from the Taisuzu Sect.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, even after learning that the Taisuzu Sect had a Penetrating Divinity Realm cultivator emerge, Gu Yang's heart was not in a panic.</p><p></p><p>After all, although the situation was serious, it had not reached a point beyond his control.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Gu Yang summoned another person.</p><p></p><p>"I am at your service, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>The person was Shi Zhen, the supreme general of the Guangyang Army currently.</p><p></p><p>Although he was dressed in ordinary clothes, his square face had a resolute expression, and the aura of an iron-blooded warrior was difficult to conceal, with a powerful physique containing formidable strength.</p><p></p><p>"The Tiangao Shensha Formation I previously entrusted to you, how is its progress?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at the man in front of him and asked.</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhen cupped his hands and said, "To report to Your Majesty, the Tiangao Army has now fully mastered the Tiangao Shensha Formation. In a direct battlefield confrontation, as long as no Grand Masters intervene, we have the confidence to surround and eliminate the enemy.</p><p></p><p>Even if a Grand Master personally intervenes, the Tiangao Army, although unable to eliminate them, can still hold them off.</p><p></p><p>If the Tiangao Army can perfect this formation, they can even surround and eliminate Grand Masters!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yang nodded slightly upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The Formation of the Heavenly Dipper and Demon Slayer was a formation technique he had accidentally obtained earlier. To be precise, it was a military formation for marching and warfare.</p><p></p><p>According to the description of this formation, it required a foundation of thirty-six thousand cultivators at the Refined Blood Realm, and then the grand formation could be deployed to contend with Sect Master-level experts. If this formation could be cultivated to perfection, even early-stage Grand Sect Masters could be fought.</p><p></p><p>However, this was not the limit of the Formation of the Heavenly Dipper and Demon Slayer.</p><p></p><p>If thirty-six thousand Sect Masters could form the grand formation, they could even contend with the top Martial Dao Grand Sect Masters, or even match existences above Grand Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>But this was just a conjecture of the one who created this formation, and Gu Yang did not truly believe in it much.</p><p></p><p>After all, just the thirty-six thousand Sect Masters alone was enough to make one hesitate.</p><p></p><p>Even though Gu Yang now ruled the entire Qingyun State, he had only allowed Shi Zhen to establish the Thirty-Six Thousand Heavenly Dipper Army, which was composed entirely of Refined Blood Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>This was the true elite of Qingyun State.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, the elite among the elite.</p><p></p><p>With Shi Zhen, a cultivator who had already reached the Dao of Qi and Blood Sect Master realm, leading them and coordinating with the Formation of the Heavenly Dipper and Demon Slayer, eliminating True Meaning Sect Masters would be no problem.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Shi Zhen was now a Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Two years ago, with the accumulation of abundant resources and the martial arts provided by Gu Yang, he had broken through the Refining Impurity Barrier and reached the Sect Master realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he was not an ordinary innate Sect Master, but a Qi and Blood Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>This was the first true Sect Master-level expert that Gu Yang had cultivated.</p><p></p><p>Given Shi Zhen's unwavering loyalty, Gu Yang naturally placed him in charge of the Heavenly Dipper Army.</p><p></p><p>"News has come from Lingzhou that the Grand Elder of the Taisuzu Sect is suspected to have broken through and become the only Divinity Realm expert in the world. He is now heading towards the Central State, and once the issues there are resolved, my Qingyun State will surely be the next target of the Taisuzu Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Nurturing an army for a thousand days and using it in a single moment, after years of recuperation, I hope the Heavenly Dipper Army will not disappoint me in the upcoming battle!" Gu Yang said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>His words caused Shi Zhen's expression to change, and he quickly said, "Your Majesty, rest assured that if the Taisuzu Sect dares to invade, the Heavenly Dipper Army will fight to the last man and not allow them to threaten Qingyun State in the slightest!"</p><p></p><p>"Go," Gu Yang waved his hand, dismissing Shi Zhen.</p><p></p><p>He had initially wanted to have Gu Yi pass this news back to the Gu Family Manor, but after thinking about it, Gu Yang decided to abandon this plan.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Yang was well aware that his father's connections were far-reaching, and he suspected that his father might have already learned of the news from Lingzhou before he did.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Yang sensed movement behind him and turned around, only to see a woman approaching with a gentle smile on her face.</p><p></p><p>"Li'er, you're here!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Fushi!"</p><p>"The Grand Elder of the Taisuzu Sect!"</p><p></p><p>In the Gu Family Manor, just as Gu Yang had expected, Gu Qingfeng had already received the news from the secret guards and understood the situation in Lingzhou.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the main hall, Gu Peng was sitting in the lower seat.</p><p></p><p>"Master, it is said that the Grand Elder of the Taisuzu Sect was already at the half-step Divinity Realm hundreds of years ago, and he has been in seclusion all this time, just to take that final step. Now that he has emerged from seclusion, could it be that he has succeeded in his breakthrough?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>He did not fully understand how terrifying the Divinity Realm was, but he could be certain that experts at that level were far beyond the capabilities of so-called Martial Dao Grand Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Divinity Realm was above the Transformation Realm, and experts in the Transformation Realm alone were already capable of suppressing ordinary Martial Dao Grand Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>Among the same realm, the Magi were the strongest.</p><p>This was a widely recognized fact in the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this did not apply to the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>Ever since cultivating the Longevity Sutra, Gu Peng felt that he had become terrifyingly strong within the same realm. Even though he had not yet comprehended the True Meaning and entered the True Meaning Sect Master realm, nor had he advanced further to become a Martial Dao Grand Sect Master, he was confident that he could suppress many Sect Masters in the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>The five chapters of the Longevity Sutra could allow cultivators to build a perfect foundation.</p><p>The difference between Sect Masters, even within the same realm, could be shockingly vast.</p><p></p><p>Even though Gu Peng had not yet cultivated the Longevity Sutra to the point of perfecting the Refining Impurity chapter, and had only entered the Refining Bone chapter, it was already sufficient.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "If there are no unexpected circumstances, that person should have broken through to the Divinity Realm."</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the existence at the Divinity Realm can rival the Martial Ancestors from thousands of years ago. Master, do you have the confidence to deal with him?" Gu Peng asked.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the one with the best chance of dealing with Fushi in Qingyun State was the person before him.</p><p></p><p>"Whether I can deal with him can only be determined by actually engaging in battle. However, my Gu Family has been rooted in Qingyun State for twenty years. A single Taisuzu Sect may not be enough to threaten the foundation of my Gu Family!" Gu Qingfeng's expression remained calm, without a trace of nervousness towards the Divinity Realm.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Peng felt relieved.</p><p>Given his understanding of Gu Qingfeng, if the latter spoke with such confidence, then he must have the means to suppress Fushi.</p><p></p><p>In that case, Gu Peng had no need to worry.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Qingfeng looked at Gu Peng and said, "You have been cultivating the Sutra of the Sun and Moon?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, I have been cultivating the Sutra of the Sun and Moon for many years, but I have never been able to truly enter the door of this Sect Master's supreme art."</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng smiled bitterly.</p><p>The difficulty of Sect Master's supreme arts was far greater than he had imagined. Even though he was now an innate Sect Master and had been contemplating the Sutra of the Sun and Moon for many years, he still had not been able to truly comprehend the True Meaning of this Sect Master's supreme art, nor could he make it his own.</p><p></p><p>All these years, Gu Peng had only grasped the superficial aspects of the Sutra of the Sun and Moon.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, it was because his natural talent was not good enough.</p><p>Otherwise, he would not have been stuck at the Refining Skin Realm for decades.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng casually took out a manual from his bosom and handed it to Gu Peng, saying, "This is a manual I wrote in my spare time, containing a portion of the True Meaning of the Sutra of the Sun and Moon. If you can comprehend it, you may be able to enter the True Meaning Sect Master realm faster."</p><p></p><p>"I'm grateful to the Master!" Gu Peng took the Sect Master's manual with both hands, his expression filled with joy.</p><p>A manual containing the True Meaning of a Sect Master was truly invaluable.</p><p></p><p>"Go," Gu Qingfeng waved his hand, and Gu Peng respectfully took his leave.</p><p></p><p>The manual containing the True Meaning of the Sutra of the Sun and Moon was just a random idea of Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>There were many ways to preserve True Meaning in the world, and the main difference lay in the completeness of the True Meaning.</p><p></p><p>For someone like Gu Qingfeng, with his current cultivation, a casual punch could leave behind remnants of True Meaning power.</p><p></p><p>However, this fragmented True Meaning would be extremely difficult for ordinary people to comprehend, and the True Meaning itself, due to its incomplete nature, would also be more violent. Those with insufficient cultivation might even risk being harmed by the True Meaning.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, if the True Meaning could be fully contained in a medium, it would be much easier for others to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the issue of preservation time would also come into play.</p><p>With a medium to contain it, the preserved True Meaning would last much longer, just like the Sect Master's True Meaning diagram that Gu Qingfeng had obtained earlier, as well as the Sect Master's manual he had acquired from the Divine Fist Sect.</p><p></p><p>These True Meanings had existed for hundreds or even thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, whether it was the slash Gu Qingfeng had made in Guangyang Prefecture or the one in Xueshan Prefecture, the True Meaning power left behind would not last very long, perhaps only ten or a hundred years before dissipating completely.</p><p></p><p>This was the difference between the two.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng summoned one of the secret guards.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, closely monitor the situation in the Central State. Any news must be reported to me as quickly as possible!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!" The secret guard respectfully withdrew.</p><p></p><p>After making these arrangements, Gu Qingfeng turned his gaze towards the direction of the Central State, his expression remaining calm and unruffled.</p><p></p><p>"A Divinity Realm expert!"</p><p></p><p>"I do want to see just how powerful this rumored Divinity Realm expert is!"</p><p></p><p>"If I can slay this Divinity Realm expert from the Taisuzu Sect, I believe there will be no one in the Nine States who can stop Yang's steps anymore."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the existence of the Divinity Realm, a rare sense of battle intent surged within Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>He yearned for a battle! But there was no opponent in the world worthy of him.</p><p>Whether it was the so-called Transformation Realm Magi or Martial Dao Grand Sect Masters, in Gu Qingfeng's eyes, they were no different from ants that could be easily crushed with a wave of his hand.</p><p></p><p>Such existences held no challenge for him.</p><p>Only the current emergence of the Divinity Realm expert could truly stir some ripples in Gu Qingfeng's heart.</p><p></p><p>This level of strength only existed in legends.</p><p>In the past, the Xian Clan of the Xianzhou had a Divinity Realm expert who dominated the world for thousands of years, demonstrating the immense power of Divinity Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people, upon hearing of such an existence, would only feel fear, but for Gu Qingfeng, he had only a burning desire for battle.</p><p></p><p>However, despite his eagerness for a fight, Gu Qingfeng would not act hastily.</p><p></p><p>Fushi's intention to head to the Central State was already quite clear, so Gu Qingfeng was in no rush.</p><p></p><p>After all, before the issues in the Central State were resolved, the Taisuzu Sect's next target would undoubtedly be Qingyun State.</p><p></p><p>In the meantime, Gu Qingfeng needed to adjust his own state, reaching the peak of his current realm, so that he could face that Divinity Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether Fushi truly posed a threat to him, out of respect for the only Divinity Realm expert in the Nine States, Gu Qingfeng would not be careless.</p><p></p><p>A lion hunting a rabbit would still use its full strength.</p><p>Especially when it came to a Divinity Realm expert, who only appeared once in thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng returned to the Whetstone Hall to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p>He had already cultivated the Eight Layers of Refined Blood Sutra to the seventh layer, but had not yet broken through to the eighth layer.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, Gu Qingfeng hoped that before the war arrived, he could perfect the Refined Blood Sutra.</p><p>If he could master this pinnacle Grand Sect Master martial art, it would further strengthen his own abilities.</p><p></p><p>However, the difficulty of cultivating a Grand Sect Master's martial art was extremely high.</p><p>To be honest, Gu Qingfeng was not very confident in his ability to break through to the eighth layer of the Refined Blood Sutra in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>But even if he could not achieve a breakthrough, as long as he could strengthen his own power by a fraction, that would be good enough.</p>

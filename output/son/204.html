        <h1>Chapter 204</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>News spread from the Central Plains, shaking the entire world.</p><p></p><p>Ji Chunqiu had perished.</p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Dynasty had completely fallen.</p><p></p><p>As soon as this news came out,</p><p></p><p>The Nine Provinces were immediately thrown into great turmoil.</p><p></p><p>The moment Gu Yang learned of the news, he immediately ordered the powerful figures like Gu Yun to act, helping the two armies to accelerate the unification of the entire Qingyun Province.</p><p></p><p>And in the Gu Family Manor, Gu Qingfeng had also learned of this news.</p><p></p><p>"The Imperial House of Ji has ultimately failed!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was not too surprised by this outcome.</p><p></p><p>After all, the failure of the Imperial House of Ji was a foregone conclusion.</p><p></p><p>These immortal sects and noble families had an established convention, where they would take turns supporting one power to rule the world every three thousand years. If a power dared to break this convention and truly become the hegemon of the Nine Provinces, the other powers would not allow it.</p><p></p><p>Especially after the Taixuan Dynasty had lasted for three thousand six hundred years, the immortal sects and noble families would be even less tolerant.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>The destruction of the Taixuan Dynasty was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>Unless,</p><p></p><p>The Imperial House of Ji could produce an unparalleled supreme expert who could dominate the world.</p><p></p><p>In that case,</p><p></p><p>There would be a real possibility of changing the situation.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately,</p><p></p><p>Although the Imperial House of Ji had accumulated formidable foundations, they still had not reached the level of dominating the world.</p><p></p><p>Even at the Half-Step Divinity Realm, they were powerful,</p><p></p><p>But they still could not change the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Now that the Taixuan Dynasty has been destroyed, the turmoil in the Central Plains will surely escalate further. It remains to be seen who can truly subdue the heroes and take control of the Central Plains!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked towards the Central Plains, as if he could see the rising smoke and flames.</p><p></p><p>The destruction of the Taixuan Dynasty was just the first step of the chaotic times.</p><p></p><p>The maneuvering of the immortal sects and noble families was the truly crucial step.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Provinces revered the Central Plains.</p><p></p><p>Whoever could emerge from the Central Plains in the future would have a great chance of establishing themselves as the ruler of the world.</p><p></p><p>This upcoming struggle,</p><p></p><p>Would be even more intense than the suppression of the Taixuan Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>After all, when they were suppressing the Taixuan Dynasty, all the powers were united, strictly speaking, they were divided into only two camps.</p><p></p><p>But now it's different.</p><p></p><p>With the collapse of the Taixuan Dynasty, the original rebel camp has completely fragmented, and now it's a battle of the heroes, the war will be much more intense.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng glanced at the information panel.</p><p></p><p>He saw that Gu Yang had also accelerated his pace, and at this rate, it would not be long before the Qingyun Province fell into his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Once the Qingyun Province is under Alang's control, he can be considered a top-tier warlord in the world!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng mused.</p><p></p><p>In the Nine Provinces of the world,</p><p></p><p>Whoever can control a single province can be considered a top-tier warlord.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>If one controls a province, they will inevitably become the target of many powers.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Qingfeng was not too worried about this.</p><p></p><p>In fact,</p><p></p><p>Ever since the battle in Guangyang Prefecture, the eyes of the world have been on this place, even if Gu Yang does not unify the entire Qingyun Province, it would not change much.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, even Divinity Realm experts can be fought against, with this power, I believe I can resolve many troubles!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was quite confident in his own strength.</p><p></p><p>To be honest,</p><p></p><p>Ever since he comprehended the Heavenly Saber Dao and cultivated the Heavenly Saber Profound Meaning to the twelfth level, as well as perfecting his Pure Yang True Body, Gu Qingfeng was not even sure of the true limit of his combat power.</p><p></p><p>But one thing,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng could be a hundred percent certain of.</p><p></p><p>As long as he used all his trump cards and activated the two great Heavenly Veins, he would have a chance of slaying even Divinity Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>With this thought,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng continued to ponder the Unextinguishable Saber Intent.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>One month later.</p><p></p><p>A piece of news arrived,</p><p></p><p>Causing Gu Qingfeng's expression to brighten.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, the royal palace has sent good news, the Queen Consort is pregnant!"</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this news, Gu Qingfeng's calm and unruffled inner heart finally rippled with some waves.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Li was pregnant.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the Gu Family could add another bloodline.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also glanced at the information panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your son 'Gu Yang' led his army to conquer six cities in seven days, wherever they went, the rebel armies retreated in fear!"</p><p></p><p>"Your son 'Gu Yang' received guidance from a Grand Master, and his cultivation has improved slightly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your son 'Gu Yang' consumed the secret elixir of the Divine Martial Sect, and successfully left behind his bloodline!"</p><p></p><p>"Your son 'Gu Yang' received guidance from a Grand Master, and his cultivation has improved slightly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your son 'Gu Yang' received guidance from a Grand Master, and his cultivation has improved slightly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your son 'Gu Yang' consumed the secret elixir of the Divine Martial Sect, and his strength has improved slightly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your son 'Gu Xuan' had his body purified by the Primordial True Qi, and his cultivation has improved slightly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your son 'Gu Xiu' had his body purified by the Primordial True Qi, and his cultivation has improved slightly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your daughter 'Gu Shengnan' had her talent improved slightly by the Primordial True Qi!"</p><p></p><p>"Your son 'Gu Yang' received guidance from a Grand Master, and his strength has improved slightly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your son 'Gu Yang' led his army to pacify the entire Danyang Prefecture, the name 'Guangyang King' has become widely known!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The Danyang Prefecture has also fallen into Alang's hands!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng formally emerged from his seclusion.</p><p></p><p>He took a step into the air, and his entire body rose up, heading towards the direction of the Guangyang Prefecture capital.</p><p></p><p>Soaring through the air,</p><p></p><p>This was a technique Gu Qingfeng had researched.</p><p></p><p>This so-called soaring through the air, was essentially a method of a cultivator's control over their own power, as well as utilizing the forces of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>In theory, as long as one's true qi and blood essence were strong enough, even Patriarch-level experts could briefly soar through the air.</p><p></p><p>The only problem was that for such powerful experts, the consumption would be tremendous.</p><p></p><p>But for Gu Qingfeng, the consumption of soaring through the air was not too severe.</p><p></p><p>Soon,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng entered the capital city.</p><p></p><p>When he descended from mid-air, he immediately caused an uproar among the many palace guards, many of them instinctively drew their weapons, surrounding Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>But soon,</p><p></p><p>A guard recognized Gu Qingfeng's identity and shouted angrily, "Put away your weapons quickly, this is the Martial Saint, Senior Gu, you must not be disrespectful!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this,</p><p></p><p>The guard hurriedly stepped forward, bowing respectfully to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"I am Liu Feng, paying respects to Senior Gu!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>He could see that the cultivation of Liu Feng in front of him was not weak, although he had not broken through to the Patriarch Realm, he was at least a high-level Refining Impurity Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Liu Feng said respectfully, "Since Senior Gu has arrived, I will go and inform the King, please wait here for a moment."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the trouble."</p><p></p><p>"It's my honor, Senior."</p><p></p><p>Liu Feng respectfully invited Gu Qingfeng into the main hall, and then immediately went to report to Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>Soon,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang hurriedly came over.</p><p></p><p>"Father, why did you not notify me in advance, so that I could have prepared something."</p><p></p><p>"What do you need to prepare?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng raised his eyebrows, his words causing Gu Yang to smile awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>It was just a polite remark, but when Gu Qingfeng responded like that, Gu Yang momentarily did not know how to reply.</p><p></p><p>Soon,</p><p></p><p>He subtly changed the topic, coming to sit next to Gu Qingfeng, and then curiously asked, "Father, what brings you to the royal palace suddenly?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that Lady Zhong is pregnant?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng asked directly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang nodded, "Father, please wait a moment, I'll have Lady Zhong come over."</p><p></p><p>Immediately,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang instructed the servants.</p><p></p><p>Soon,</p><p></p><p>Zhong Li, dressed in a palace gown, walked over.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Father."</p><p></p><p>"Have a seat."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression also softened a bit, revealing a warm smile, and then his gaze fell on Zhong Li's abdomen, with his keen perception, he could sense the stirrings of life there.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng personally examined Zhong Li's pulse.</p><p></p><p>After a while,</p><p></p><p>His face broke into an even brighter smile.</p><p></p><p>"Twins, not bad, not bad at all!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not expect that Zhong Li was not only pregnant, but carrying twins, there were two life forces in her meridians.</p><p></p><p>Then,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at Gu Yang with a slightly dissatisfied expression.</p><p></p><p>"Since Lady Zhong is carrying twins, why did your men come to inform me without mentioning this?"</p><p></p><p>The presence of twins would be quite obvious.</p><p></p><p>Any cultivator with slightly deeper cultivation would be able to sense it.</p><p></p><p>With the many experts under Gu Yang's command, Gu Qingfeng did not believe they were unaware of this.</p><p></p><p>"I wanted to give Father a surprise."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang laughed awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "Now that Lady Zhong is pregnant, she needs more care and nourishment, this matter cannot be taken lightly."</p><p></p><p>"I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang also became serious, nodding his head, then he hesitated for a moment before speaking.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I also have a matter I would like to discuss with Father."</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>"There are many affairs in the royal palace now, and I don't have much time to manage the Gu Family Manor. In this way, my position as the Manor Lord is somewhat nominal.</p><p></p><p>So I think it's better to return the position of Manor Lord back to you, Father, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang expressed his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>This idea had been on his mind for a while.</p><p></p><p>When he originally obtained the position of Gu Family Manor Lord, he wanted to use this identity to further develop his power.</p><p></p><p>But reality did not match his expectations.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang did not expect that his actions would be so successful, that in just a few years he would develop his power to the point of establishing himself as a King.</p><p></p><p>In this case,</p><p></p><p>The position of Gu Family Manor Lord became somewhat unnecessary for him.</p><p></p><p>But the Gu Family Manor was the lifeblood of the Gu Family, and Gu Yang hoped to revitalize it, but he had too many responsibilities as the Guangyang King and did not have much energy left to manage the affairs of the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded, "You have already decided, then Father has no objections."</p><p></p><p>The position of Manor Lord,</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Yang no longer wanted it, then it would return to Gu Qingfeng's hands.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also handed several elixirs to Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>"These are Marrow Cleansing Elixirs, when you eventually break through to the Marrow Cleansing Realm, you can consume them to refine your foundation."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang accepted them gratefully.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Colour was delighted.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the miraculous nature of the elixir in Gu Qingfeng's hands, Gu Yang naturally understood.</p><p></p><p>Although the consumption of such an elixir does not compare to the secret elixir of the Divine Martial Sect, which can allow martial artists to break through their cultivation, it can refine the foundation and physique of martial artists, thereby giving them a stronger foundation.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, this kind of elixir is much stronger than the secret elixir of the Divine Martial Sect.</p><p></p><p>After all, as long as the foundation is solid enough, one can go even further in the future.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, a strong foundation can also give martial artists greater power within the same realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang has now perfected the Bone Refining, and his combat power is already capable of defeating Refined Impurity Realm experts, apart from mastering the true meaning of the Sect Master, his own strong foundation is also not to be overlooked.</p><p></p><p>After handing over the Marrow Cleansing Pill to Gu Yang, Gu Qingfeng did not stay in the capital city for too long, and then departed leisurely.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the news that Gu Qingfeng had resigned as the lord of the Gu Family Manor and that the old lord Gu Qingfeng had resumed control of the Gu Family Manor also spread.</p><p></p><p>However, this news did not cause too much of a stir.</p><p></p><p>After all, the slight changes in the Gu Family Manor are insignificant compared to the current affairs in the nine states of the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>Back at the Gu Family Manor, Gu Qingfeng then re-entered seclusion.</p><p></p><p>—</p><p></p><p>Days and months passed.</p><p></p><p>Three months later, Gu Yang officially unified the entire Qingyun State, becoming a top-tier warlord, and the fame of the King of Guangyang shook the world, causing everyone to take notice.</p><p></p><p>However, after occupying the entire Qingyun State, Gu Yang did not rush to attack the Central State, but instead changed his previous offensive strategy and began to focus on developing domestic affairs.</p><p></p><p>In such a situation, the Qingyun State, which had experienced more than a decade of war, finally regained a brief period of peace.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, Gu Yang also issued an order, offering rewards to the world for any traces of evil spirits and anomalies. As long as the whereabouts of evil spirits and anomalies are discovered, they can be reported to the authorities, and after verification, a certain reward will be given.</p><p></p><p>These rewards can be in the form of silver or martial arts techniques.</p><p></p><p>If one can eliminate the anomalies and suppress the evil spirits, the reward will be even more generous.</p><p></p><p>With this, the many martial artists in the jianghu were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>After all, since the rise of the sorcerers, the martial way has declined, and many martial arts lineages are controlled by those top sects, making it almost impossible for ordinary martial artists to make further progress.</p><p></p><p>The root cause of this is the lack of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>But now, Gu Yang openly offers many martial arts as rewards, which has given these people hope.</p><p></p><p>So, a wave of eliminating evil spirits and anomalies has also erupted in the Qingyun State.</p><p></p><p>Whenever there are traces of evil spirits and anomalies revealed, they will attract a large number of martial artists.</p><p></p><p>After all, compared to reporting the whereabouts of evil spirits and anomalies to the authorities, the reward for eliminating the anomalies and suppressing the evil spirits is truly more generous.</p><p></p><p>So, many people, upon discovering the whereabouts of evil spirits and anomalies, first think of relying on their own strength to suppress these things, rather than reporting them to the authorities.</p><p></p><p>Of course, for ordinary martial artists, evil spirits cannot be slain, and to suppress them, they need to have gold as a vessel.</p><p></p><p>But in the past, gold was mostly controlled by various top forces, making it difficult to truly circulate, but after Gu Yang took control of the Qingyun State, he has also relaxed the restrictions on the circulation of gold.</p><p></p><p>In this way, some martial artists can also obtain a portion of gold as a vessel for suppressing evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>If they encounter powerful evil spirits that are difficult to deal with, they can only report to the authorities and wait for the powerful experts of the Guangyang Army to come and solve the problem.</p><p></p><p>The current King of Guangyang also has many powerful experts. Not only is there the Sword Dao Master, a great martial arts master, but there are also many other master experts guarding various regions, so even if powerful evil spirits emerge, they will not be able to stir up much of a storm.</p><p></p><p>In just a few months, the evil spirits and anomalies in the Qingyun State have been reduced by 90%.</p><p></p><p>Without the disruption of evil spirits and anomalies, as well as the impact of war, the people of the Qingyun State have finally had a chance to recuperate.</p><p></p><p>This approach has also led to a significant increase in Gu Yang's popularity among the common people.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"You have a new offspring!"</p><p></p><p>In the Gu Family Manor, Gu Qingfeng looked at the refreshed information on the panel and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Yang'er's two children have finally been born!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Gu Qingfeng came out of seclusion.</p><p></p><p>This time, he still went directly to the capital city.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng arrived at the palace, he saw that it was already decorated with lanterns and festive banners, and everyone had joyful smiles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Qingfeng's arrival, someone soon reported to Gu Yang, who then hurriedly came over.</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>"I calculated the time, and the children should have been born around now. It seems I haven't arrived too late!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled calmly and made up a reason for his arrival.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang did not have any doubts about this.</p><p></p><p>After all, it is normal for Gu Qingfeng to be able to calculate the time of the birth after ten months of pregnancy.</p><p></p><p>"Father has arrived just in time. The two children have been born, and I was just wanting to ask Father to give them names!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang immediately had someone bring the two infants.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the two babies in the swaddling clothes, and his expression became somewhat gentle. They say that grandparents have a natural affection, and he felt a sense of closeness when looking at the two children.</p><p></p><p>He then examined them further and found that both were boys, and after slightly infusing his true qi into their bodies, a smile appeared on his face again.</p><p></p><p>"The innate qualities of these two children are better than yours by a large margin!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Gu Qingfeng's words, Gu Yang also showed a smile on his face. Although this praise was for his own sons, Gu Yang was still very happy to hear it.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Gu Qingfeng pondered for a moment and said, "The eldest shall be named Shengxing, and the younger shall be named Sheng'an."</p><p></p><p>"Shengxing, Sheng'an... Thank you, Father, for bestowing these names!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang repeated the names and nodded.</p><p></p><p>Prospering the country and bringing peace!</p><p></p><p>This was exactly what Gu Yang had in mind.</p><p></p><p>So, the names of the two children were determined.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng looked at the two of them, then flicked his finger, and a drop of fresh blood suddenly separated from his fingertip and divided into two, falling into the brows of the two infants.</p><p></p><p>"This drop of blood contains a bit of my power, which can ensure that they will not be easily invaded by any evil."</p><p></p><p>This was not something Gu Qingfeng made up on the spot.</p><p></p><p>At his level of cultivation, his pure yang blood can make evil spirits retreat and dare not approach. </p><p></p><p>The Demon-Slaying Blade was able to directly slay evil spirits precisely because it had a drop of Gu Qingfeng's essence blood.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, this drop of blood is Gu Qingfeng's own essence blood.</p><p></p><p>For martial artists, essence blood is particularly precious. Even though Gu Qingfeng's cultivation is profound, the essence blood he has refined is limited. Every drop of essence blood lost is a form of weakening himself, and it takes some time to slowly recover.</p><p></p><p>If it were ordinary people, Gu Qingfeng would not make such a sacrifice, but for his two newborn grandsons, he does not mind spending a drop of essence blood.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this essence blood not only allows them to be immune to the Demon-Slaying, but also has other miraculous uses, which Gu Qingfeng simply did not mention.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang, standing beside him, could also feel the mighty power contained in this drop of blood, and his face was filled with gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"The children are deeply grateful to Father for this!"</p><p></p><p>"Consider this as something I, as their grandfather, have done for them."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said, "Father has come from afar, why not stay in the palace for a few more days before returning?"</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered for a moment and did not refuse.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang's face lit up with joy and he immediately ordered the servants to make arrangements for Gu Qingfeng to stay in the palace.</p><p></p><p>The news of Gu Qingfeng's arrival and his stay in the palace soon spread.</p><p></p><p>The next day, the Sword Dao Master came to visit.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior Gu!"</p><p></p><p>This renowned grand master of the jianghu now had a very humble demeanor, behaving like a junior disciple in front of Gu Qingfeng. If an outsider were to see this, they would be greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>But the Sword Dao Master did not feel there was anything wrong with this.</p><p></p><p>This time, seeing Gu Qingfeng again, he felt even more deeply that the other party was unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's gaze also fell on the Sword Dao Master, and a slight smile appeared on his face: "It has been a while since we last met. You have already reached the realm of a grand martial arts master, truly worthy of congratulations!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior is too kind, if not for Senior's guidance, I would not have the qualifications to step into this realm."</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Master was humble and deferential, without any of the arrogance one would expect from a grand martial arts master.</p><p></p><p>Then, the Sword Dao Master hesitated for a moment before carefully speaking again: "I have long admired Senior. When we parted hastily at the Blood Mountain Manor, I never had the chance to meet you again. </p><p></p><p>Today, since Senior has come to the palace, I wish to seek guidance from Senior, if that is possible?"</p><p></p><p>"Since you have such a wish, I am also interested in exchanging insights with a fellow martial arts master. Let us discuss the dao."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng naturally understood the Sword Dao Master's thoughts, and he also wanted to witness the so-called power of a grand martial arts master.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the two of them reached an agreement.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Qingfeng's consent, the Sword Dao Master was overjoyed, and he first sought guidance from Gu Qingfeng in terms of martial arts cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, although the martial arts cultivation of the grand master was remarkable, it was no match for Gu Qingfeng at the moment.</p><p></p><p>In just one encounter, the Sword Dao Master was suppressed.</p><p></p><p>His years of arduous cultivation in the martial way was completely insignificant in the face of Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>This defeat, although the Sword Dao Master had anticipated it, still left him somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>"Senior's cultivation has reached the level of the Dao, I am in awe!"</p><p></p><p>After a long while, the Sword Dao Master's gaze towards Gu Qingfeng contained even more reverence.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "To have reached the level of a grand martial arts master, your foundation is also not weak. It's just that the true meaning of your sword dao has not yet reached the grand master realm. If you can make further progress and step into the grand master realm, your strength can advance even further."</p><p></p><p>"But each person has their own path to walk, and your sword dao path is ultimately your own, somewhat different from mine.</p><p></p><p>However, the myriad ways under heaven all lead to the same destination, this is the path I have walked. Perhaps you can learn from it."</p><p></p><p>With that, Gu Qingfeng pointed out a seemingly ordinary gesture, but in the eyes of the Sword Dao Master, it transformed into a divine sword that penetrated the heavens, causing his mind and spirit to be involuntarily drawn into it, unable to extricate himself for a long time.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 120</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Sun Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>When the news of Elder Duan Ping's death reached the sect, the entire Heavenly Sun Sword Sect was shaken.</p><p></p><p>After all, any elder of the Heavenly Sun Sword Sect was a powerful cultivator at the Innate Realm level.</p><p></p><p>Such powerful experts rarely ever fell in battle.</p><p></p><p>Now that an elder had perished, the impact was immeasurable.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, many powerful cultivators from the sect emerged from their seclusions and gathered in the main hall of the sect.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a figure suddenly appeared on the empty seat of the sect master, and an eerie, icy aura permeated the hall.</p><p></p><p>All the sect cultivators hurriedly stood up and bowed respectfully towards the figure.</p><p></p><p>"Greet the sect master!"</p><p></p><p>"No need for formalities," the sect master's hoarse voice replied.</p><p></p><p>The sect master's face was pale and devoid of any color, but his eyes were slightly reddish, as if filled with boundless demonic power, making it difficult to maintain eye contact.</p><p></p><p>"Duan Ping has perished. What are your thoughts on this?"</p><p></p><p>The sect master's crimson gaze fell upon the crowd, and everyone felt immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, a powerful cultivator from the sect spoke up solemnly, "My lord, Gu Qingfeng brazenly killed Elder Duan, showing utter disregard for our Heavenly Sun Sword Sect. I propose that we unleash our thunderous might to annihilate the Gu Clan Manor and restore the reputation of our sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Correct, the Gu Clan Manor must be destroyed!"</p><p>"Gu Qingfeng, who dares to kill our sect elder, deserves to die!"</p><p>"What kind of Saber Monarch is he? A mere cultivator dares to be so arrogant, truly ignorant of his own mortality!"</p><p></p><p>As the first person spoke, the others also chimed in, their words filled with contempt, not even considering the Gu Clan Manor worthy of their attention.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the Heavenly Sun Sword Sect had the right to do so. As the true hegemon of the entire Qingyun Province, the Heavenly Sun Sword Sect was an immortal power, while the Gu Clan Manor and its predecessor, the Gu Clan, had only been established for a mere two decades.</p><p></p><p>The sect master spoke calmly, "The Shenquan Sect's patriarch was a true master hundreds of years ago, and later achieved the Possessed Spirit Realm as a spirit cultivator. Even without breaking through to the Fused Spirit Realm, his strength is likely not far off.</p><p></p><p>In terms of power, Shen Wudao is comparable to a True Meaning Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Qingfeng was able to slay Shen Wudao, it means his strength is at least at the True Meaning Patriarch level, perhaps even comparable to a Half-Step Grand Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful expert, even a Fused Spirit Realm cultivator might not be able to defeat him."</p><p></p><p>"Among those present, how many of you have reached the peak of the Fused Spirit Realm, and who among you can be confident in slaying Gu Qingfeng?"</p><p></p><p>These words fell upon the hall, and it fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The sect master's words had completely shattered their lingering pride.</p><p></p><p>The peak of the Fused Spirit Realm was only equivalent to a Half-Step Grand Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>If the Saber Monarch truly possessed strength comparable to a Half-Step Grand Patriarch, the outcome of a life-and-death battle would be uncertain.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, the Gu Clan Manor is located in Guangyang Prefecture. If our Heavenly Sun Sword Sect mobilizes a large force, the imperial court might not turn a blind eye.</p><p></p><p>In the past, since Gu Qingfeng did not display enough value, the imperial court might have ignored the matter. But now, with a cultivator suspected to be at the True Meaning Patriarch level, or even a Half-Step Grand Patriarch, the imperial court is likely looking for an opportunity to bring the Gu Clan Manor into their fold."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, we shall set aside the matter of Duan Ping for now."</p><p></p><p>"Within a hundred years, I shall personally take action and go to slay Gu Qingfeng!"</p><p></p><p>The sect master's words caused the eyes of the cultivators to light up.</p><p></p><p>"The sect master is going to break through?"</p><p></p><p>"After stagnating for so many years, it's time for a breakthrough. Within a hundred years, I will definitely break through and..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This evil spirit must be thoroughly suppressed!" </p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Tian Yang Sect had a bloodthirsty look in his eyes, and his entire expression had become somewhat sinister and ferocious.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was akin to a person having two different faces.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the Patriarch of the Tian Yang Sect's expression returned to normal, but the redness in his eyes seemed to have deepened a bit.</p><p></p><p>The next instant, the Patriarch's figure disappeared from the main hall.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in a certain secret chamber, the cold and eerie aura emanating from the Patriarch suddenly erupted. There was a shadow frantically twisting and struggling behind him, as if something was trying to crawl out, with blood-red eyes like a demonic spirit from the underworld.</p><p></p><p>"Get back there!!" </p><p></p><p>The Patriarch roared in a low voice, and a powerful force burst forth, forcibly suppressing that eerie power back down.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, the Patriarch's expression turned gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"The speed of the evil spirit's revival is getting faster and faster. I must hurry up and break through, and once I reach the Divine Realm, I will be able to truly suppress this evil spirit.</p><p></p><p>At that time, who in the world will be able to match me? </p><p></p><p>The Taiyan Dynasty has ruled the world for three thousand years, and now it is time for the Tian Yang Sword Sect to take over!"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>If a cultivator overexerts themselves in battle, it may allow the evil spirit within them to revive. Once the evil spirit revives, it becomes difficult to truly suppress it.</p><p></p><p>And that is the Patriarch's current situation.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he must break through. </p><p></p><p>Break through the limits of his cultivation and ascend to an even higher realm.</p><p></p><p>Only then can he re-suppress the awakened evil spirit within him.</p><p></p><p>"That Gu Qingfeng has quite good natural talent. In less than a hundred years, he can reach the level of a Half-Step Grand Master. Perhaps within a hundred years, he may even become a true Grand Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, grow well, my child. The flesh and blood of a Grand Master is far more delicious than that of an ordinary cultivator. When I break through to the Divine Realm, devouring a Grand Master will save me a lot of effort in consolidating my realm!"</p><p></p><p>This is another reason why the Patriarch has not made a move against Gu Qingfeng yet.</p><p></p><p>Because he sees the potential for Gu Qingfeng to break through to the Grand Master realm.</p><p></p><p>Grand Masters are extremely rare in the world.</p><p></p><p>If he can devour a newly ascended Grand Master, the benefits would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>So the Patriarch waits.</p><p></p><p>Waits for the right moment to make his move.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the Patriarch closed his eyes again, and the sinister, icy aura continued to surge around him.</p>

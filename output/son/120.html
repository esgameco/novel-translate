        <h1>Chapter 120</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Sun Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>When the news of Elder Duan Ping's death reached the sect, the vast Heavenly Sun Sword Sect was shaken.</p><p></p><p>After all, any elder of the Heavenly Sun Sword Sect was a powerful cultivator at the Innate level.</p><p></p><p>Such powerful experts rarely met with untimely deaths.</p><p></p><p>Now that an elder had fallen, the impact was immeasurable.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, many powerful cultivators within the sect emerged from their seclusions and gathered in the main hall of the sect.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a figure suddenly appeared on the empty seat of the sect master, and an eerie, icy aura permeated the hall.</p><p></p><p>All the sect cultivators hurriedly stood up and bowed respectfully to the figure.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>"No need for formalities," the Sect Master's hoarse voice replied.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master's face was pale and devoid of any color, but his eyes were slightly reddish, as if filled with boundless demonic power, making it difficult to meet his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Regarding Elder Duan Ping's death, what are your thoughts?"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master's crimson gaze fell upon the crowd, and everyone felt immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a powerful cultivator spoke up solemnly, "My lord, Gu Qingfeng brazenly killed the elder, disregarding our Heavenly Sun Sword Sect. I believe we should use thunderous means to annihilate the Gu Clan Manor and restore the reputation of our sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Correct, the Gu Clan Manor must be destroyed!"</p><p>"Gu Qingfeng, for killing our sect's elder, he deserves to die!"</p><p>"What Saber Cultivator? A mere martial artist dares to be so arrogant, truly ignorant of his own mortality!"</p><p></p><p>As one person spoke, the others also chimed in, not even considering the Gu Clan Manor as worthy of their attention.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the Heavenly Sun Sword Sect had the right to do so. As the true hegemon of the entire Qingyun Province, the Heavenly Sun Sword Sect was an immortal power, while the Gu Clan Manor and its predecessor, the Gu Clan, had only been established for a mere two decades.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master spoke calmly, "The Shenquan Sect's elder was a Grandmaster hundreds of years ago, and later achieved the Enlightened Spirit Realm through demonic cultivation. Even without breaking through to the Fusion Spirit Realm, his strength is likely not far behind.</p><p></p><p>In terms of power, Shen Wudao is comparable to a True Meaning Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Qingfeng was able to slay Shen Wudao, it means his strength is at least at the True Meaning Grandmaster level, perhaps even on par with a Half-Step Great Grandmaster!"</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful expert, even a Fusion Spirit Realm cultivator might not be able to defeat him."</p><p></p><p>"Among those present, how many of you have reached the peak of the Fusion Spirit Realm, and who has the confidence to slay Gu Qingfeng?"</p><p></p><p>At these words, the hall fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master's words had completely shattered their remaining pride.</p><p></p><p>The peak of the Fusion Spirit Realm was only equivalent to a Half-Step Great Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>If the Saber Cultivator truly possessed strength comparable to a Half-Step Great Grandmaster, the outcome of a life-and-death battle would be uncertain.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, the Gu Clan Manor is located in Guangyang Prefecture. If our Heavenly Sun Sword Sect were to mobilize a large force, the imperial court might not turn a blind eye.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Gu Qingfeng did not display enough value, so the imperial court might have ignored him. But now, with a cultivator suspected to be at the True Meaning Grandmaster or even Half-Step Great Grandmaster level, the imperial court is likely looking for an opportunity to bring the Gu Clan Manor into their fold."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, we shall set aside the matter of Elder Duan Ping for now."</p><p></p><p>"Within a hundred years, I will personally go and slay Gu Qingfeng!"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master's words made the crowd's eyes light up.</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master is going to break through?"</p><p></p><p>"After stagnating for so many years, it's time to make a breakthrough. Within a hundred years, I will definitely break through and..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"This evil spirit must be completely suppressed!" </p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Tian Yang Sect had a bloodthirsty look in his eyes, and his entire expression had become somewhat sinister and ferocious.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was akin to a person having two different faces.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div> the Patriarch of the Tian Yang Sect's expression returned to normal, but the redness in his eyes seemed to have deepened slightly.</p><p></p><p>In the next instant, the Patriarch's figure disappeared from the main hall.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, </p><p></p><p>in a certain secret chamber,</p><p></p><p>the cold and eerie aura emanating from the Patriarch suddenly erupted, and a shadow behind him was frantically twisting and struggling, as if something was trying to crawl out, with blood-red eyes like a demonic spirit from the underworld.</p><p></p><p>"Get back there!!" </p><p></p><p>The Patriarch roared in a low voice, and a powerful force burst forth, forcibly suppressing that strange and ominous power.</p><p></p><p>After a long while,</p><p></p><p>the Patriarch's expression turned gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"The speed of the evil spirit's revival is getting faster and faster. I must hurry up and break through, and once I reach the Divine Realm, I will be able to truly suppress this evil spirit.</p><p></p><p>At that time, who in the world will be able to match me?</p><p></p><p>The Taiyan Dynasty has ruled the world for three thousand years, and now it is time for the Tian Yang Sword Sect to take its place!"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>If a cultivator overexerts themselves in battle, it may allow the evil spirit within them to revive. Once the evil spirit revives, it becomes difficult to truly suppress it.</p><p></p><p>And that is the Patriarch's current situation.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, </p><p></p><p>he must break through.</p><p></p><p>Break through the limits of his cultivation and ascend to an even higher realm.</p><p></p><p>Only then can he re-suppress the awakened evil spirit within him.</p><p></p><p>"That Gu Qingfeng has quite good natural talent. In less than a hundred years, he can reach the level of a Half-Step Grand Master. Perhaps within a hundred years, he may even become a true Grand Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, grow well, my child. The flesh and blood of a Grand Master is far more delicious than that of an ordinary cultivator. When I break through to the Divine Realm, devouring a Grand Master will save me a lot of effort in consolidating my realm!"</p><p></p><p>This is another reason why the Patriarch has not made a move against Gu Qingfeng yet.</p><p></p><p>Because he sees the potential for Gu Qingfeng to break through to the Grand Master realm.</p><p></p><p>In the world,</p><p></p><p>Grand Masters are as rare as phoenix feathers and qilin horns.</p><p></p><p>If he can devour a newly ascended Grand Master, the benefits would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>So, </p><p></p><p>the Patriarch is waiting.</p><p></p><p>Waiting for the right moment to make his move.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>the Patriarch closed his eyes again, and the sinister, icy aura enveloping him surged unabated.</p><p></p><p>â€”</p><p></p><p>While the Tian Yang Sword Sect was temporarily inactive, on the other side, Pei Jing learned of the destruction of the Shen Quan Sect and the death of Duan Ping, and he was furious.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>he completely abandoned the idea of recruiting Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Since he cannot use him, then he must destroy him.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>because the Gu Family Manor is located in Guangyang Prefecture, even though Pei Jing is enraged, he is powerless to do anything.</p><p></p><p>Given that Gu Qingfeng was able to slay Shen Wudao and Duan Ping, his strength is at least at the True Meaning Grandmaster level. The difficulty of crossing multiple prefectures to kill a True Meaning Grandmaster is self-evident.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing can only temporarily suppress the anger in his heart. He has ordered a fierce attack, hoping to seize control of the entire Liuyun Prefecture as soon as possible, and then use Liuyun Prefecture as a base to devour the entire Taishan Commandery.</p><p></p><p>Once the entire Taishan Commandery falls under his control, dealing with the Gu Family Manor will be a simple matter.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 35</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Sss—"</p><p></p><p>When many people saw Gu Qingfeng ruthlessly slaying Shen Tonghai, they were all horrified.</p><p></p><p>Shen Tonghai, the Eight-Armed Ape!</p><p></p><p>He was also a renowned martial artist in the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>Although he was not a top-tier master, his cultivation had already reached the middle stage of Blood Refining, yet he was still no match for Gu Qingfeng in a single breath.</p><p></p><p>Such strength.</p><p></p><p>It left everyone utterly astonished.</p><p></p><p>Even Yun Tianxing's pupils shrank, and his expression turned furious.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Qingfeng, how dare you kill someone here!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Weren't you all gathered here to kill me? Now that I've killed you, what's the problem? Did you think I could only submit to being killed by you?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Yun Tianxing's gaze darkened. "You first destroyed the Qin family, and now you've openly killed Old Master Shen. How could I, Yun, let you leave the Tianyun Sect alive!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Yun Tianxing looked at the others.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I ask all of you to join forces with me to subdue this demon—"</p><p></p><p>"Yun Tianxing, if you want to make a move, why bother calling on the others? Let me see the strength of you, the Sect Master of the Tianyun Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Before Yun Tianxing could finish speaking, Gu Qingfeng directly interrupted him, his powerful vital energy bursting forth as he pushed out a palm towards Yun Tianxing, a terrifying scorching wave sweeping over, causing Yun Tianxing's expression to change abruptly.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Yun Tianxing activated his own vital energy, his physical body becoming as pure as jade, and a sword by his side unsheathed, the white silk slicing through the air, the faint sword shadows dazzling and elusive, almost impossible to discern the real from the false.</p><p></p><p>The Tianyun Body Refining Technique! </p><p>The Tianyun Sword Technique!</p><p></p><p>These were the two supreme skills of the Tianyun Sect. As the Sect Master, Yun Tianxing naturally mastered these two supreme skills.</p><p></p><p>The others who witnessed this scene were all greatly shocked, especially by that sharp sword qi, which, even from several meters away, could make their skin ache.</p><p></p><p>However, as Gu Qingfeng's palm pushed forward, all the sword shadows suddenly dissipated, and a sharp sword was grasped in his hand, a mid-grade divine weapon that could slice iron like mud, yet it could not break through the defense of his palm.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, they saw Gu Qingfeng clench his five fingers, and the long sword let out a mournful cry as it shattered.</p><p></p><p>The powerful force from the sword body caused Yun Tianxing's tiger-mouth to crack, making his expression change once again.</p><p></p><p>"Go!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng casually flicked his hand, and several iron fragments sliced through the air, instantly penetrating Yun Tianxing's physical defense, blooming several blood flowers on his body.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, he stepped forward, his large hand pressing down on Yun Tianxing.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying might caused Yun Tianxing to reveal a look of fear.</p><p></p><p>"Stop—"</p><p></p><p>An enraged voice rang out, but Gu Qingfeng ignored it, his hand landing on Yun Tianxing's body, causing the latter's blocking arms to break into several segments, and the lingering force imprinted on his chest instantly caved it in, his body crashing heavily to the ground, his life extinguished in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"You're courting death!!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Changkong was furiously enraged, his powerful vital energy bursting forth like a smoky haze, his long sword gleaming with icy coldness as he thrust it towards Gu Qingfeng's back.</p><p></p><p>The latter, as if already aware, suddenly turned around, flicking his finger to easily deflect the thrusting sword, then struck out a palm towards Cloud Changkong's solar plexus, the scorching vital energy palm force causing the other's expression to change, and he could only retreat to block.</p><p></p><p>From Gu Qingfeng's initial strike to Yun Tianxing's defeat, and then to Cloud Changkong's attack, all these events happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>It was only when Gu Qingfeng and Cloud Changkong were fully engaged in battle that the others finally reacted.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Come.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the sunken chest on the ground, Cloud Tianxing had already died. Most people had a pale expression on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Tianxing's strength was among the top three of all the warriors present.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful expert, yet he was killed on the spot by a single strike from Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>The latter's strength made them feel horrified.</p><p></p><p>However, some who had witnessed Gu Qingfeng's killing of the Qin family's patriarch were not that shocked.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Qin family's patriarch was killed by Gu Qingfeng with such thunderous force, let alone this Cloud Tianxing.</p><p></p><p>Just then, everyone's gaze fell on the center of the field.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng and Cloud Tianxing were both surrounded by surging blood energy, making it impossible to see the scene clearly, only occasionally seeing flashes of swords and surging heat waves.</p><p></p><p>This scorching blood energy power made people feel like they were reminded of something.</p><p></p><p>"The Scorching Sun Divine Palm! Gu Qingfeng cultivates the Scorching Sun Divine Palm!"</p><p></p><p>"It is rumored that when the Scorching Sun Divine Palm is cultivated to a high level, one can practice the Scorching Sun Palm Qi, with blood energy as scorching as raging flames, unparalleled. Unexpectedly, not only did Gu Qingfeng obtain the Scorching Sun Divine Palm, but he has also cultivated this supreme martial art to such a high level in a short period of time."</p><p></p><p>An old powerhouse said with a shocked expression, as if he had realized something.</p><p></p><p>The reputation of the Scorching Sun Immortal was once renowned, and the Scorching Sun Divine Palm he created was also famous in the jianghu. Although not many people knew the characteristics of this martial art, there were still quite a few.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the other party's words, the expressions of the others changed again.</p><p></p><p>It had not been long since Gu Qingfeng obtained the Scorching Sun Divine Palm, only about three years at most.</p><p></p><p>In three years' time, he had cultivated this supreme martial art to such a high level.</p><p></p><p>This kind of talent made them all feel extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the battle in the field had undergone a change. Surging blood energy seemed to converge and explode into towering raging flames, then a figure was sent flying out.</p><p></p><p>The battle had been decided? Seeing this scene, everyone looked towards the figure that was sent flying, wanting to see who had been defeated.</p><p></p><p>When they recognized the identity of the defeated person, their faces turned even paler.</p><p></p><p>"Cloud Changkong!"</p><p></p><p>The current Heavenly Cloud Sect's Supreme Elder had a scorched palm print on his chest, and blood was flowing from his mouth and nose.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough!" Cloud Changkong struggled to get up from the ground, his eyes filled with fear as he looked at Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"The Scorching Sun Palm Qi... I never expected you to have cultivated the Scorching Sun Divine Palm to such a realm..." He coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood and then heavily fell to the ground, no longer making a sound.</p><p></p><p>That last palm strike had completely shattered his internal organs.</p><p></p><p>It was only his powerful life force at the Refined Blood Realm that had kept him from dying immediately.</p><p></p><p>With Cloud Changkong's downfall, Gu Qingfeng's blue robe remained unscathed, without a single injury. He indifferently swept his gaze over the corpse on the ground, then looked at the others.</p><p></p><p>"Is there anyone else who wants to try?"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the entire venue fell silent. No one dared to speak.</p><p></p><p>As the leader of the Heavenly Cloud Sect, the sect master and the supreme elder had already perished. If they were to make a move, they would most likely meet the same fate.</p><p></p><p>The remaining Heavenly Cloud Sect elders were also too afraid to act.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 47</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Majestic Physique!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took out this martial art from his item list, and immediately the martial art turned into a stream of light and merged into his mind. Countless memories then surged forth.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was able to cultivate this martial art to the perfected level, as if he had cultivated the Heavenly Majestic Physique for many years.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Majestic Physique is perfected!</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng only felt that his qi and blood had become much more robust.</p><p></p><p>Such a change.</p><p></p><p>Made him reveal a look of surprise in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Intermediate-grade martial art perfected!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the martial art rewarded this time is not simple!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng finally realized that the information panel was referring to a perfected intermediate-grade martial art.</p><p></p><p>From this, it can be seen.</p><p></p><p>The rewards for a descendant's breakthrough are not just limited to stat points and ordinary martial arts, but may also include the possibility of rewarding perfected martial arts.</p><p></p><p>In this way.</p><p></p><p>With the martial art perfected.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng can save himself a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>Just like now.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Majestic Physique is perfected. </p><p></p><p>If Gu Qingfeng had to cultivate it himself, it would take him more than ten years to cultivate an intermediate-grade martial art to the perfected level.</p><p></p><p>And this is based on the premise that he is already a Washing Marrow Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise.</p><p></p><p>The time required to perfect the Heavenly Majestic Physique would be even longer.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has directly achieved the perfection of the Heavenly Majestic Physique, which is incomparable.</p><p></p><p>Similar to the Scorching Sun Divine Palm, the Heavenly Majestic Physique is also divided into nine layers. When entering the fifth layer, the Heavenly Majestic Physique will cultivate the protective Qi armor.</p><p></p><p>The so-called protective Qi armor refers to the manifestation of the cultivator's qi and blood turning into Qi armor.</p><p></p><p>Normally.</p><p></p><p>As long as the cultivator's qi and blood are strong enough, they can turn into protective Qi armor, but the difference is that the protective Qi armor cultivated after the perfection of the Heavenly Majestic Physique will be much more domineering.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>"Although a top-tier intermediate-grade martial art cannot make my strength leap forward, it has still strengthened my foundation a bit. As long as I accumulate enough martial arts, even if I remain at the initial Washing Marrow Realm, I will be able to suppress all the strong ones of the same realm!"</p><p></p><p>This reward has made Gu Qingfeng very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Where there is one, there will be two.</p><p></p><p>Since this breakthrough of Gu Yang's can reward a perfected martial art, it means that in the future, he will also have the opportunity to obtain a perfected martial art again.</p><p></p><p>The only thing Gu Qingfeng is not sure about is whether the appearance of a perfected martial art is a matter of probability, or if it can only be obtained when the descendant breaks through a major realm.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took out the Bone Refining Elixir from his item list.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Blood Refining Elixir, the Bone Refining Elixir is obviously the elixir for cultivators at the Bone Refining Realm. Although he has already broken through to the Washing Marrow Realm, it does not mean that taking the Bone Refining Elixir will have no effect at all.</p><p></p><p>Immediately.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took a pill.</p><p></p><p>After the Bone Refining Elixir entered his body, a terrifying amount of energy was immediately released, and the 365 golden bones in his body were violently trembling, as if they were being tempered.</p><p></p><p>After a long time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng let out a long breath.</p><p></p><p>This time he took the Bone Refining Elixir, his cultivation did not progress at all, but his golden bones were tempered to be more perfect, thereby further enhancing his strength.</p><p></p><p>Clearly.</p><p></p><p>The Bone Refining Elixir is different from the Blood Refining Elixir. The latter is to strengthen the foundation and enhance the qi and blood, helping the cultivator to break through, while the former is simply to strengthen the foundation.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>The strengthening of the foundation through the Bone Refining Elixir is completely incomparable to the Blood Refining Elixir.</p><p></p><p>If one has just entered the Bone Refining Realm, taking one Bone Refining Elixir per day would be the limit.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>But now, Gu Qingfeng had entered the Xixue realm, and the restrictions on taking the Refined Bone Pill had been greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>It only took one day.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng consumed all ten Refined Bone Pills.</p><p></p><p>The effects of taking the medicinal pills were that his strength became even more powerful.</p><p></p><p>"After taking the Refined Bone Pills, my entire body's golden bones have been tempered. In terms of strength, I have now increased by at least one level of combat power compared to before!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes were solemn.</p><p></p><p>An increase of one level of combat power may not seem like much, but for martial artists, the accumulation of strength is never as simple as one plus one equals two.</p><p></p><p>Now, this one-level increase in combat power could be considered a significant enhancement in strength.</p><p></p><p>"This is White Stone City, it's quite different from Guangyang Prefecture!" </p><p></p><p>Among the group of three, there was a woman in a purple dress with a beautiful countenance, who wrinkled her delicate nose, her beautiful eyes full of disdain.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the other handsome young man laughed and said, "Sister, White Stone City is after all a small place, how can it be compared to Guangyang Prefecture? I've heard that the biggest force in the entire White Stone Way now is the Gu Family.</p><p></p><p>In a small place like this, the little Gu Family doesn't amount to much. If this were in Guangyang Prefecture, the Gu Family would be insignificant."</p><p></p><p>The young man's words were not spoken softly at all, and the others who heard this were all filled with shock and disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew that Gu Qingfeng was currently the number one expert in White Stone Way, and the Gu Family was the only top-tier major force.</p><p></p><p>Now someone dared to speak so disrespectfully on the street, which naturally shocked everyone.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, someone stepped forward, saying in a dissatisfied tone, "Young man, you'd better be more careful with your words!"</p><p></p><p>Although the young man in front of them looked distinguished, this was White Stone City, on the Gu Family's territory. If they could do the Gu Family a favor, perhaps they could also gain the Gu Family's support.</p><p></p><p>This was the reason why this person had directly stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>"Are you from the Gu Family?" Ye Shi's eyes grew cold.</p><p></p><p>The man shook his head, "Although I am not from the Gu Family, the Gu Family's reputation should not be slandered by the likes of you--"</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, Ye Shi suddenly struck out with a palm, instantly landing on the man's chest. The powerful force sent the man flying, and he had not even hit the ground before he died.</p><p></p><p>"Not from the Gu Family, just a waste who hasn't even entered the Lianxue realm, yet you dare to speak in front of me? You're courting death!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Shi sneered, his eyes full of disdain as he looked at the corpse.</p><p></p><p>The others who witnessed this all changed expression.</p><p></p><p>Many recognized the identity of the deceased martial artist, who, although he had not entered the Lianxue realm, was a perfected Lianpi martial artist. Yet he was killed with a single palm strike by Ye Shi.</p><p></p><p>This showed that the person in front of them was at least a Lianxue realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the crowd scattered in all directions.</p><p></p><p>A Lianxue realm expert was considered a powerful figure here, and the leader, the elder in the brocade robe, had not made a move the entire time.</p><p></p><p>From the elder's expression, it was clear that the young man was his junior.</p><p></p><p>If the junior was already a Lianxue realm martial artist, the elder's strength would be even greater.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, someone relayed this news to the Gu Family.</p><p></p><p>"The newcomers are up to no good!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the report from his subordinates, Gu Yang's eyes grew cold. The other party had openly insulted the Gu Family and killed someone on the street, which was enough to show that their intentions were not simple.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Yang was not too worried.</p><p></p><p>He had broken through to the Lianxue realm himself, and behind him, he had the powerful Gu Qingfeng as a backer.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were strong enemies coming, the Gu Family would not necessarily be unable to handle them.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

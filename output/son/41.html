        <h1>Chapter 41</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chai Hong's expression changed slightly, and then she smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>"The level of martial arts involved here is quite significant. Ordinary people won't sell them, only occasionally some fallen noble families or sects will be forced to sell such martial arts.</p><p></p><p>If the Master of the Gu family is interested, I can keep an eye out for you."</p><p></p><p>"Alright then!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>He looked at Chai Hong, paused, and then said, "The martial arts of Baishi Dao are weak, I want to learn some information about the martial dao, I wonder if the Cloud Pavilion can satisfy this?"</p><p></p><p>"This is a small matter, our Cloud Pavilion has a precious martial arts manual compiled by past masters, covering all levels of the martial dao, it's only ten taels of silver."</p><p></p><p>"Then give me one!"</p><p></p><p>"Master Gu, please wait a moment--"</p><p></p><p>Chai Hong immediately had someone bring over a martial arts manual and handed it to Gu Qingfeng. The two then completed the transaction.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not linger long at the Cloud Pavilion, and directly got up to leave.</p><p></p><p>Watching his retreating figure, Chai Hong's beautiful eyes flickered slightly.</p><p></p><p>"His aura is so refined, he must have already reached the Refining Bone realm--"</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect Baishi Dao to produce another master of the Refining Bone realm after all these years, and he's not even that old. If he has a complete inheritance, he may be able to advance even further.</p><p></p><p>It's just a pity that those deep martial arts are not easily revealed by the sects and noble families.</p><p></p><p>Without the corresponding martial arts as inheritance, I'm afraid this person will be limited to the Refining Bone realm for the rest of his life!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Holding the martial arts manual,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng leisurely returned to the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>He opened the martial arts manual and studied the information recorded.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao starts from Refining Skin, then Refining Blood, Refining Bone, above Refining Bone is Washing Marrow, and above Washing Marrow is Refining Viscera.</p><p></p><p>When one reaches the peak of Refining Viscera, the martial artist's physical body is already perfected, and can no longer advance.</p><p></p><p>At this point,</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood are filled with true qi, becoming a Xiantian Master.</p><p></p><p>For those with exceptional talents, they can further transform their qi and flesh, breaking through the limits and reaching the realm of the Qixue Master.</p><p></p><p>Among them,</p><p></p><p>The Xiantian Master has a lifespan of three hundred years.</p><p></p><p>The Qixue Master has a lifespan of five hundred years, and even at the moment of their final transformation, their qi and blood will remain in a peak state.</p><p></p><p>"Xiantian Master... Qixue Master, the martial dao in this world is indeed extraordinary. According to the records here, masters who have reached the realm of the Martial Ancestor are already transcendent beings.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Xiantian Master, the Qixue Master is obviously much stronger, but it's clear that the difficulty in becoming a Qixue Master is the greatest.</p><p></p><p>I just wonder how many Martial Ancestor experts there are in this world!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered.</p><p></p><p>He was not at all surprised that there were even stronger existences above the Refining Bone realm, because there is always someone better out there.</p><p></p><p>Although after reaching the Refining Bone realm, one's strength is already superhuman, they are not considered the top experts in the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>Since there are Martial Ancestors here, it means there must be Martial Ancestor experts in the world. Gu Qingfeng just didn't know how they compare to the Sorcerers, and how they fare against the Demonic Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>With the Cloud Pavilion's methods, Gu Qingfeng believed they must have information about Sorcerers and Demonic Cultivators, but these topics are too sensitive, so Gu Qingfeng naturally wouldn't bring trouble upon himself.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes,</p><p></p><p>Inadvertently revealing certain information can bring about great trouble.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>So, regarding the demonic calamities and the affairs of sorcerers, Gu Qingfeng did not plan to inquire about them like the Cloud Pavilion did. These matters were particularly sensitive, and one could see that ordinary people were completely unaware of the demonic calamities.</p><p></p><p>For Gu Qingfeng at the moment, the most important thing was still to break through his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>According to the records of the Martial Dao Classics, the Refining Bone Realm was divided into four stages:</p><p></p><p>Iron Bone!</p><p>Copper Bone!</p><p>Silver Bone!</p><p>Golden Bone!</p><p></p><p>If Gu Qingfeng could refine all 365 of his bones into Iron Bone, he would have entered the initial stage of the Refining Bone Realm.</p><p></p><p>If he could refine his entire body into Copper Bone, he would be able to enter the middle stage of the Refining Bone Realm. With a body of Silver Bone, he could enter the advanced stage of the Refining Bone Realm. If he could refine his entire body into Golden Bone, he would have reached the perfected Refining Bone Realm and could then break through to an even higher realm.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary people, just refining their bones into Iron Bone would make them invulnerable to blades and swords, and even after death, their bones would be extremely difficult to incinerate.</p><p></p><p>If one could refine their bones into Golden Bone, even after a hundred years of death, their bones would not decay, and their golden bones would shine with a divine light.</p><p></p><p>"However, truly refining one's bones into Golden Bone is no easy feat. For common people, even achieving a complete Iron Bone body is an extremely difficult task. Even the Patriarch of the Qin Family, who had been immersed in the Blood Refining Realm for many years, had not been able to refine his entire body into Iron Bone, let alone reaching higher realms."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng put away the Martial Dao Classics, as this book had provided him with a channel to gain a deeper understanding of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Although the martial dao was prevalent in this world, each sect and faction was extremely secretive and protective of their own techniques. Occasionally, some mid-grade martial arts could circulate in the jianghu, but the higher-grade and above martial arts were extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>Even if one sought to be accepted as a disciple, the sects might not necessarily take them in. And if one were to serve other powerful families as a subordinate, it was not certain that they would be able to cultivate the profound martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, if Gu Qingfeng wanted to obtain the higher-grade martial arts, he could only rely on improving himself.</p><p></p><p>"At the moment, I can only wait for Xuan'er and Xiu'er to grow up and see if they can break through like Yang'er, and if that happens, it would be a great help to me.</p><p></p><p>If that's possible, then this matter will be settled!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was nurturing the bodies of Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu, refining their bones from a young age, with the purpose of this.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the higher the cultivation of a martial artist, the lower the probability of them being able to bear offspring.</p><p></p><p>Like Gu Qingfeng, who had now entered the Refining Bone Realm, his essence was refined to the extreme, and it would be much more difficult for him to truly conceive a child compared to ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>When Xu Yulan was pregnant back then, it was because Gu Qingfeng's cultivation was not too high at the time, and he had diligently cultivated every day, which allowed him to conceive by chance. If it were now, it might not be the case.</p><p></p><p>Normally, once a cultivator enters the Blood Refining Realm, the probability of them being able to bear offspring is greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>The most suitable time would have been back then in Linxian County.</p><p></p><p>However, at that time, Gu Qingfeng's own life was in constant danger, and if he had brought his family along, he might not have been able to leave Linxian County alive.</p><p></p><p>It was not until he had stabilized himself on the White Stone Road that Gu Qingfeng had the time to make his next move.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng put aside the distractions in his heart and continued to refine his tendons and bones, cultivating other martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Since he was unable to break the limit of the Scorching Sun Divine Palm at the moment, Gu Qingfeng had to indirectly strengthen his own power by delving into other martial arts, which was the best course of action.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng found that once he had entered the Refining Bone Realm, the lower-grade martial arts were no longer useful to him. If he wanted to refine his qi and blood and enhance his strength, he would at least need mid-grade martial arts.</p><p></p><p>A few years ago, it would not have been easy for Gu Qingfeng to obtain mid-grade martial arts, but after destroying the forces of the Qin Family's Iron Bone Gang and the Heaven Cloud Sect, he had managed to acquire a number of mid-grade martial arts.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

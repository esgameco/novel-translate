        <h1>Chapter 227</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has gained some understanding of the true essence of taming beasts!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has received guidance from a Realm of Divine Transformation cultivator, and his cultivation has improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Shengnan' has gained some comprehension in cultivating the Qinglian Sword Sutra, and her strength has slightly increased!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has gained some understanding in cultivating the Sun and Moon Fist Sutra, and his cultivation has slightly improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has obtained the legacy left behind by a mysterious powerful expert, and his strength has improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has received guidance from the remnant soul of a powerful expert, and his cultivation has improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has consumed an ancient elixir, and his cultivation has broken through greatly, reaching the peak of the Refining Bone Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +30 Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has consumed an ancient elixir, and his cultivation has broken through greatly, reaching the initial stage of the Marrow Cleansing Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +50 Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has consumed an ancient elixir, and his cultivation has broken through greatly, reaching the middle stage of the Marrow Cleansing Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +50 Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Mysterious Legacy!"</p><p></p><p>"Remnant Soul of a Powerful Expert?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the words appearing on the information panel, his expression slightly strange.</p><p></p><p>After moving the Gu family manor to the capital, Gu Xiu had been out on a journey.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not stop him.</p><p></p><p>He only repeatedly warned Gu Xiu not to enter the Ancient Beast Mountain Range recklessly, as it was extremely dangerous, and the slightest carelessness could lead to his death there.</p><p></p><p>To this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiu had nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>What Gu Qingfeng did not expect was that Gu Xiu had barely left the Gu family manor when he encountered an extraordinary encounter, and it seems he even obtained a mysterious old grandpa.</p><p></p><p>Remnant Soul of a Powerful Expert! This kind of thing is simply too familiar.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Yang before and Gu Xuan after, and now Gu Xiu, Gu Qingfeng couldn't help but fall into some contemplation.</p><p></p><p>He realized that the fortunes of his descendants seem to be quite good.</p><p></p><p>But this is not a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>The free-range cultivation of his descendants can lead to more uncertainties.</p><p></p><p>Like Gu Xiu.</p><p></p><p>His original cultivation realm was already several levels behind Gu Xuan, but now a single ancient elixir has completely made up for this gap.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Xiu had cultivated diligently in the Gu family manor, it would be questionable whether he could even break through to the peak of the Refining Bone Realm, let alone step into the Marrow Cleansing Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, Xuan and Xiu are about the time to get married and have children, should I not urge them to expand the Gu family bloodline..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered for a moment, then shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Well, the blessings of the descendants are up to them. I shouldn't force such matters."</p><p></p><p>"Continuing the bloodline should rely on the eldest son."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang has already become the lord of the Nine Provinces, and has sired three offspring. Given his current status and position, he is destined to leave behind an even greater bloodline legacy.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng believes Gu Yang understands this without him needing to say anything.</p><p></p><p>Then,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng turned his attention back to the Primal Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>The profound mysteries of this Saint-Emperor's supreme technique are truly extraordinary. Although Gu Qingfeng has entered the door, further advancement is not easy.</p><p></p><p>If he wants to improve the Primal Heavenly Dao using Cultivation Points, it would require as many as two thousand points.</p><p></p><p>For Gu Qingfeng's current situation,</p><p></p><p>two thousand Cultivation Points is a bit too much.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>now that Gu Yang and the others have all grown up, each breakthrough in their cultivation realms can bring a lot of Cultivation Points, no longer comparable to the past.</p><p></p><p>Just like the other offspring besides Gu Yang, when they were at the Refining Blood Realm, breaking through a level only gave twenty Cultivation Points, but the breakthrough to the Marrow Cleansing Realm already gives fifty points.</p><p></p><p>This doubling of the reward is quite significant.</p><p></p><p>And then,</p><p></p><p>there is Gu Yang's breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>When he broke through to the Patriarch Realm, he was able to provide three hundred Cultivation Points at once, and now that he has broken through to the Grand Patriarch Realm, a single breakthrough can directly provide five hundred points.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Yang can break through from the initial stage of the Grand Patriarch Realm to the peak, he can provide a total of two thousand Cultivation Points.</p><p></p><p>Viewed in this way,</p><p></p><p>the requirement of two thousand Cultivation Points to improve the Saint-Emperor's supreme technique once does not seem too difficult to accept.</p><p></p><p>More importantly,</p><p></p><p>when Gu Yang can break through the bottleneck of the Grand Patriarch Realm and step into the Realm of Divine Transformation and even higher realms, the Cultivation Points he can provide will only increase.</p><p></p><p>This is the advantage of being the first-born offspring.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Senior, is the Primal Realm truly filled with powerful experts?"</p><p></p><p>In a certain restaurant, Gu Xiu, dressed in sturdy clothes, sat alone at a table, with wine and dishes arranged in front of him, but his mind was focused on the ring in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Within this ring was the remnant soul of a self-proclaimed Primal Emperor Saint.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p></p><p>the Primal Emperor Saint spoke in a deep voice: "The Primal Realm is divided into five domains, with numerous top sects and powerful families, and experts are indeed abundant, far beyond what you can imagine in the Nine Provinces."</p><p></p><p>"In your Nine Provinces, being able to reach the Grand Patriarch Realm is already a rare sight, but in the South Domain where I once created the Primal Emperor Holy Land, even the so-called Grand Patriarchs were only the lowest-level disciples."</p><p></p><p>Hearing his words, Gu Xiu's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>The five domains of the Primal Realm! The Primal Emperor Holy Land!</p><p></p><p>Just from the Primal Emperor Saint's few words, Gu Xiu could almost see the vast expanse of this world.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently,</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiu asked curiously, "Since the senior is a powerful expert from the South Domain, why did you appear in the Nine Provinces?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p></p><p>the Primal Emperor Saint fell silent for a while.</p><p></p><p>After a long time,</p><p></p><p>he slowly spoke: "The Nine Provinces are not as simple as you think. There are rumors that in the most ancient times, a supreme power once arose from here.</p><p></p><p>This power originated from the Nine Provinces and dominated the entire Primal Realm.</p><p></p><p>But later, for some unknown reason, this power collapsed overnight, and even the spiritual veins of the Nine Provinces were shattered, causing the land to gradually decline in spiritual energy and fall into obscurity."</p><p></p><p>"Many powerful experts from other domains entered the Nine Provinces, seeking to find the legacy of that supreme power, but they all returned empty-handed. Over time, the Nine Provinces gradually faded from the sight of the Primal Realm."</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiu listened, his heart slightly shaken.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Provinces have such a history? Then why did the senior fall here?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiu asked the question that was on his mind.</p><p></p><p>With the Primal Emperor Saint's strength, he should not have fallen in the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>After all, from the Primal Emperor Saint's own words, he had some understanding of the cultivation system beyond the Grand Patriarch Realm.</p><p></p><p>Above the Grand Patriarch Realm was the Realm of Divine Transformation, above that was the Dao Palace, and above the Dao Palace were the Saint-Emperors, the supreme existences that transcended the Saint-Emperors.</p><p></p><p>The strength of such realms was self-evident.</p><p></p><p>The Primal Emperor Saint sighed bitterly, "When I entered the Nine Provinces, I sought a breakthrough, but unexpectedly triggered the remnant restrictions left behind by that ancient supreme power, and suffered a grave injury, leading to my demise.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for this precious treasure protecting me, allowing me to preserve a remnant of my soul, I would have long since perished."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Although I have used secret techniques to preserve my soul, it is now difficult for me to sustain it for much longer."</p><p></p><p>"If you cannot find an opportunity for me to condense a physical body, in another one or two thousand years, I will completely dissipate into the heavens and earth."</p><p></p><p>With that, the Supreme Emperor Extreme let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he had already reached the peak of the Great Saint realm, hoping to make further breakthroughs, but unexpectedly ended up trapped here.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, the Supreme Emperor Extreme also had some regrets.</p><p></p><p>If he had not ventured into the Nine Provinces, with his natural talent, he might have broken through the boundaries long ago, and would not have fallen into this predicament.</p><p></p><p>But now, regretting was useless.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators at the Great Saint realm could live for eight thousand years, and when the Supreme Emperor Extreme fell, he had already lived for six thousand years. He later used a secret technique to seal his own body, thus avoiding the ravages of time.</p><p></p><p>But now, upon awakening, the seal has been lifted on its own. If he cannot condense a physical body and make a breakthrough, he will only be able to endure for another one or two thousand years before his lifespan is exhausted.</p><p></p><p>"This disciple will do his utmost to carry on your legacy," Gu Xiu said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Supreme Emperor Extreme spoke again: "The Nine Provinces were indeed powerful in the past, but that is ancient history. The decline of the Nine Provinces is a fact.</p><p></p><p>With your talent, staying here would be a waste. </p><p></p><p>I established a sacred place in the Southern Domain thirty million years ago. You can take my token and go to the Southern Domain. If you can join the Imperial Extreme Sacred Land, you can save a lot of trouble."</p><p></p><p>At the end, the Supreme Emperor Extreme reminded him.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... thirty million years ago, can the forces you created still exist?" Gu Xiu asked, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the Imperial Extreme Sacred Land I established back then was the top power in the Southern Domain. Even after my demise in the Nine Provinces, with the foundation of the Imperial Extreme Sacred Land, passing on the legacy for tens of thousands of years is an easy task.</p><p></p><p>Do not underestimate me just because I have perished. The truth is, in each era, there are not many who can reach the Great Saint realm."</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Emperor Extreme laughed angrily at Gu Xiu's underestimation of him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiu was silenced, but then asked curiously, "What do you mean by the 'Dao not yet manifesting'?"</p><p></p><p>"In the Desolate Ancient Realm, the Dao manifests every ten thousand years. As the Dao manifests, it signifies that the era has truly entered its prime.</p><p></p><p>In the era when the Dao manifests, cultivation will become much easier than before. The Dao Palace can be entered by Sages, Sages can become Great Saints, and Great Saints can also glimpse the path ahead, and gradually reach the peak, even attaining Immortality!"</p><p></p><p>When he mentioned the word "Immortality" at the end, the Supreme Emperor Extreme's tone became somewhat fervent.</p><p></p><p>"Immortality!? Can there really be Immortals in this world?" Gu Xiu couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Emperor Extreme's tone became more somber again. "Whether there are truly Immortals in this world, no one knows for sure. However, I've heard that the disappearance of the supreme powers in the Nine Provinces was related to Immortality.</p><p></p><p>But throughout the endless eons of history, whether there have been true experts who have stepped onto the Immortal path and attained Immortality, even I am not certain.</p><p></p><p>But since there are legends of Immortality, it should exist, right?"</p><p></p><p>Immortality! It has been the lifelong pursuit of the powerful experts throughout the Desolate Ancient Realm. If Immortality was just a myth, why would these experts have sought it so ardently?</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Emperor Extreme then changed the topic, saying, "The manifestation of the Dao is the era of the Great Contention, the peak of an era, but also the beginning of the decline of the next era.</p><p></p><p>When the Dao hides, and the Heavenly Dao is obscured, the cultivation of cultivators will become much more difficult. Even geniuses with extraordinary talents, reaching the peak of the Dao Palace realm, will find it very difficult to attain Sagehood in this era."</p><p></p><p>"You must know that an era lasts thirteen thousand years - ten thousand years of Decline, and three thousand years of Prosperity. For geniuses born in the early Decline, to truly wait until the three thousand years of Prosperity, is an extremely difficult task.</p><p></p><p>Even Cultivators at the ninth level of the Dao Palace realm only have a lifespan of around six thousand years!"</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Emperor Extreme's words suddenly made Gu Xiu understand the tragedy of these geniuses.</p><p></p><p>The Decline Era. Difficult to attain Sagehood.</p><p></p><p>Even though they were extraordinary geniuses with heavenly talents, in the three thousand years of the Great Contention, they had the hope of attaining Sagehood, but in the end, they could only perish in obscurity.</p><p></p><p>This was indeed a tragic fate for these geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiu said, "Then, does the Senior know whether the current era is the Decline Era, or the Great Contention Era?"</p><p></p><p>"Since the Dao has not yet manifested, it should be the Decline Era," the Supreme Emperor Extreme replied.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Xiu's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>Then, the other party added a sentence.</p><p></p><p>"However, although the Dao has not yet manifested, there are already some faint stirrings. If I'm not mistaken, the current era should be the late Decline Era, and perhaps in another one or two thousand years, it will truly enter the Great Contention Era!"</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, your luck is not bad. With your talent, if you can endure until the Great Contention Era, you will definitely have the opportunity to shine brilliantly!"</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Emperor Extreme had a high opinion of Gu Xiu. His talent was excellent, and it was very compatible with his own legacy. </p><p></p><p>With Gu Xiu's talent, attaining Sagehood in the future would not be a problem, and he might even have the chance to advance further, reaching the Great Saint realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, as for going even higher, in the Supreme Emperor Extreme's view, the possibility was not very great.</p><p></p><p>However, throughout the history of the Five Domains of the Desolate Ancient Realm, how many true powerful experts had broken through the limits of Sagehood and attained the Great Saint realm? They were as rare as phoenix feathers and qilin horns.</p><p></p><p>"Take one step at a time in your cultivation. The Nine Provinces are ultimately too small. At your current age, you haven't even completed the Refined Body realm in the Nine Provinces, but if you were in the Southern Domain, true geniuses of your age would have already reached the Sect Master or even Grand Sect Master realm.</p><p></p><p>Some prodigies have even reached the Divine Change realm."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, I suggest that you go to the Southern Domain immediately, return to the Imperial Extreme Sacred Land, and then obtain some of the secret realm opportunities I've left behind. Before the Great Contention Era arrives, reaching the Dao Palace realm should not be a problem for you."</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Emperor Extreme's words left Gu Xiu deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he said with determination, "The Senior's words make sense. However, leaving the Nine Provinces is a major decision. I need to go back home first and bid farewell to my parents before going to the Southern Domain."</p><p></p><p>"That's fine," the Supreme Emperor Extreme nodded. In the end, he reminded Gu Xiu again.</p><p></p><p>"But regarding my existence, you must not casually reveal it, not even to your parents. You must know that the legacy of a Great Saint involves too many complications. Until you have attained Sagehood, you cannot let anyone know about this matter when you go to the Imperial Extreme Sacred Land."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Xiu nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>He understood the Supreme Emperor Extreme's concerns.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Xiu threw down a silver tael and then floated away.</p>

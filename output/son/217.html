        <h1>Chapter 217</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Three-Grade Lotus Flower!</p><p></p><p>This is the destiny of the dynasty.</p><p></p><p>When the Three-Grade Lotus Flower transforms into the Six-Grade Lotus Flower, the dynasty can be promoted to an empire.</p><p></p><p>However, </p><p></p><p>Achieving true promotion is not something that can be done overnight.</p><p></p><p>For a kingdom to want to be promoted to an empire, the most fundamental aspects are the population size, the people's sentiments, and the number of powerful individuals.</p><p></p><p>There is no definitive standard for this.</p><p></p><p>But in one sentence:</p><p></p><p>An empire is very strong.</p><p></p><p>It is far more powerful than a kingdom in every aspect.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng directly handed over a portion of the medicinal pills to Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>"There are a total of four types of medicinal pills here, which are the Grand Master Pill, the Nine-Grade True Meaning Pill, the Golden Body Pill, and the True Meaning Pill!"</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Master Pill can allow anyone who takes it to instantly reach the peak of the Grand Master realm. As for the Nine-Grade True Meaning Pill, taking it can allow a martial artist to comprehend the Nine-Grade True Meaning."</p><p></p><p>"The Golden Body Pill can solidify the foundation of a Master, and while the True Meaning Pill is not as powerful as the Nine-Grade True Meaning Pill, it can still help martial artists accelerate their comprehension of the True Meaning."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing these words, Gu Yang's expression immediately changed.</p><p></p><p>He did not doubt the truthfulness of Gu Qingfeng's words, but was simply shocked by the immense power of these medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>All along,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had been taking the medicinal pills provided by Gu Qingfeng, but those pills were only of the same nature as the Golden Body Pill, belonging to the category of solidifying the foundation of a martial artist.</p><p></p><p>But now,</p><p></p><p>Medicinal pills that can directly promote someone to the Grand Master realm are simply unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention,</p><p></p><p>There are also pills that can allow one to directly comprehend the Nine-Grade True Meaning.</p><p></p><p>If these medicinal pills were to be released to the outside world, they would drive everyone in the world crazy.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at Gu Qingfeng and finally asked the deep-seated doubt in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Father, where did you obtain so many mysterious medicinal pills?"</p><p></p><p>"As a father, I have my own opportunities, just as you have obtained your own opportunities."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head slightly and said with a faint smile, without explaining too much.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang felt at ease.</p><p></p><p>Indeed,</p><p></p><p>He himself had also obtained many opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would not have been able to grow so quickly.</p><p></p><p>Since he was able to obtain opportunities, it was only natural that Gu Qingfeng would also have his own opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Soon,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang reacted and looked at the various medicinal pills in front of him, his face revealing a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Now that the Shenwu Kingdom is in dire need of rebuilding, I have been troubled by the lack of capable people. With these medicinal pills, I can now cultivate a batch of powerful individuals who can be of use!"</p><p></p><p>The biggest problem facing the Shenwu Kingdom right now is its weak foundation.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family is not like other clans, with thousands of years or even tens of thousands of years of accumulation.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family's history only goes back about thirty years to the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>Thirty years of time,</p><p></p><p>How much accumulation could there be?</p><p></p><p>Even if Gu Yang were to seize the world now, the capable people under his command would still be somewhat lacking.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the Taixuan Kingdom had the backing of the Xianzhou Ji family, who even established the Zhenxie Supervisory Office to recruit all the skilled practitioners in the world for their own use.</p><p></p><p>In comparison,</p><p></p><p>The martial arts of the Nine Provinces have declined, and while there are some who have reached the Master realm, most of them are related to those immortal sects and ancient families.</p><p></p><p>True Masters with a clean background are actually quite few.</p><p></p><p>If he were to cultivate capable individuals on his own, it would require a lot of time.</p><p></p><p>But now it is different.</p><p></p><p>A single medicinal pill can directly create a supreme Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the manpower issue can be resolved.</p><p></p><p>"However, while taking medicinal pills does not have any hidden dangers, this is still a shortcut. Now that the destiny of the kingdom is upon you, breaking through to the Grand Master realm is only a matter of time. Steadily cultivating and breaking through step-by-step would be far better than taking the shortcut."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng reminded at the end.</p><p></p><p>Although taking the medicinal pills has no hidden dangers, he still does not hope that Gu Yang will directly take the pills to break through.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p></p><p>If Gu Yang takes the medicinal pills, it would be as if he has skipped the stage of breaking through to the Grand Master realm without any rewards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had previously also had the idea of taking medicinal pills to directly reach the peak of the Grand Master realm.</p><p></p><p>But now, after hearing Gu Qingfeng's reminder, he has extinguished this idea.</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Qingfeng has said so, it must be true.</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Qingfeng said.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang believes that he will be able to break through to the Grand Master realm in no time, with the destiny of the kingdom upon him.</p><p></p><p>After Gu Qingfeng left, Gu Yang secretly summoned Shi Zhen to the palace.</p><p></p><p>"Minister Shi Zhen pays his respects to Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhen cupped his hands and bowed respectfully, as kneeling was not the custom of this era.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at the person in front of him and said indifferently, "Rise."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhen straightened up.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said, "General Shi, you have been by my side for many years, haven't you?"</p><p></p><p>"I have followed Your Majesty for ten years!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhen replied without hesitation, and Gu Yang nodded, "Time flies by in the blink of an eye. All these years, I have seen your deeds, and your contributions to the Shenwu Kingdom are indispensable."</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty is too kind. If Your Majesty had not extended a helping hand back then, I would have been just a vagrant doomed to die on the streets. I can never forget Your Majesty's grace of giving me a new life!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhen hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the somewhat anxious and reverent expression on the other's face, Gu Yang immediately smiled and handed two medicinal pills to him.</p><p></p><p>Then, in Shi Zhen's puzzled gaze, Gu Yang said,</p><p></p><p>"These two medicinal pills, one can let you directly break through to the peak of the Grand Master realm, and the other can let you comprehend the Nine-Grade True Meaning."</p><p></p><p>"Although you are already a Master, your cultivation is still somewhat lacking. I bestow these two medicinal pills to you, and I only hope that you will not disappoint my expectations!"</p><p></p><p>These words,</p><p></p><p>Caused Shi Zhen's expression to change, and his grip on the medicinal pills tightened slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty's great kindness, I will repay with my life!"</p><p></p><p>"These medicinal pills are precious, you can take them right here, and I will also help protect you."</p><p></p><p>"Then I shall not be polite."</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhen did not refuse or hesitate at all, and directly swallowed the two medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the other party take the medicinal pills so decisively, Gu Yang's smile became even more gentle.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>In his perception, Shi Zhen's aura was rapidly rising, his breakthrough speed comparable to Gu Yang's own when he was establishing the kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Middle-stage Master!</p><p>Late-stage Master!</p><p>Peak Master!</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When he stepped into the peak of the Master realm, there was almost no pause, as he directly broke through the Master realm barrier and entered the Grand Master realm.</p><p></p><p>In less than a few breaths,</p><p>Shi Zhen had successfully broken through to the peak of the Grand Master realm.</p><p></p><p>That overwhelmingly powerful aura made even Gu Yang feel somewhat shocked.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was clear about the effects of the medicinal pills, to actually see someone in front of him go from just entering the Master realm to reaching the pinnacle of the Grand Master realm in just a few breaths, it was truly difficult not to be shaken.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>This did not stop there.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the peak of the Grand Master realm, Shi Zhen's aura continued to surge...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A terrifying aura of sword intent was emanating, as if it could carve out a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood, unleashing an endless killing power.</p><p></p><p>This scene directly alarmed many people within the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression changed slightly, and he immediately issued an order to the attending guards.</p><p></p><p>"Relay my command - seal off the entire imperial garden, and no one is allowed to enter without my permission!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>Under Gu Yang's order, the entire imperial garden was sealed off by the guards. Only then did he shift his gaze back to Shi Zhen.</p><p></p><p>"Ninth-level True Essence!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang mused inwardly. Although he had already comprehended the Patriarch-level True Essence, he had not yet reached the ninth level.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Gu Yang also had the idea of consuming a ninth-level True Essence Pill. After all, Gu Qingfeng had only told him not to take the Grand Patriarch Pill, but did not say he could not take the ninth-level True Essence Pill.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Yang suppressed this idea for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the aura of sword intent dissipated. Shi Zhen opened his tightly closed eyes, his face showing a hint of astonishment, then turning to amazement. He immediately bowed deeply to Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Your Majesty, for this rare opportunity. I will never forget this grace!"</p><p></p><p>His expression was excited, and his tone was slightly trembling.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the peak of Grand Patriarch, and the ninth-level True Essence - this was something Shi Zhen had never dared to imagine.</p><p></p><p>He knew his cultivation talent was not bad, but he had little confidence in becoming a true Grand Patriarch in the future. But now, a single pill had allowed him to break through to the pinnacle of Grand Patriarch, skipping over hundreds of years of arduous cultivation. How could Shi Zhen not be excited?</p><p></p><p>"Go and familiarize yourself with the power you have just attained. And this matter is not to be spoken of!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang spoke.</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhen respectfully acknowledged the order and left.</p><p></p><p>After Shi Zhen's departure, Gu Yang summoned one of the shadow guards and handed him two more Patriarch-level pills, intending to give them to Gu Yi.</p><p></p><p>Even after establishing the Shenwu Dynasty, Gu Yang had not disbanded the shadow guards, still seeing them as a force under his control that could be utilized when necessary. They could secretly monitor the officials and patrol the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Gu Qingfeng had secretly expanded the shadow guards to three thousand people, with fifteen hundred under Gu Yang's direct command, and the remaining fifteen hundred still obeying Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>As for the true size of the shadow guards, Gu Yang was not entirely clear. However, the fifteen hundred under his command were already a great help in alleviating the shortage of manpower.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had the idea to continue expanding the shadow guards, but as his most trusted force, he had to be extremely cautious about any expansion.</p><p></p><p>Before that, the first thing Gu Yang needed to do was to further strengthen Gu Yi's abilities. With a peak Grand Patriarch leading the shadow guards, their role could be even more significant.</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining five Patriarch-level pills, Gu Yang already had some ideas in mind.</p>

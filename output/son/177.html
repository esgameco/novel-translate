        <h1>Chapter 177</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng now has some new realizations.</p><p></p><p>Every achievement is the transformation of an aspect of the offspring, which can truly trigger it.</p><p></p><p>Like how Gu Yang previously occupied Guangyang Prefecture and established himself as a king, his identity was transformed into a regional lord, so he was able to trigger an achievement.</p><p></p><p>But now, Gu Yang's domain has expanded from a prefecture to a commandery, but his identity as a regional lord has not changed, so naturally he cannot trigger any new achievements.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the information panel, Gu Qingfeng continued to ponder the Longevity Sutra.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Gu Yang is constantly channeling the martial arts of many sects into the Gu Family Manor. </p><p></p><p>The entire Taishan Commandery is under his control, so the so-called aristocratic sects have to obey his commands.</p><p></p><p>Collecting the martial arts of the world is Gu Qingfeng's requirement.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang naturally will not refuse.</p><p></p><p>Under the orders of this Guangyang King, even if the other aristocratic sects are dissatisfied in their hearts, they do not dare to openly express it.</p><p></p><p>It's simple. </p><p></p><p>Whoever does not obey the commands has already been directly annihilated.</p><p></p><p>Wielding the butcher's knife, exterminating all the voices of disobedience.</p><p></p><p>Although this method is ruthless, the effect is surprisingly good, eliminating all opposing voices, leaving only the sounds of submission.</p><p></p><p>So, the Whetstone Hall now has accumulated many martial arts.</p><p></p><p>From supreme sect arts to high-grade martial arts, they are all present.</p><p></p><p>As for the low-grade and mid-grade martial arts, Gu Qingfeng did not bother to study and understand them, nor would he bring them into the Whetstone Hall.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Qingfeng has already achieved perfect body refinement and entered the realm of the Extreme Dao Master. In his eyes, many low-level martial arts are no different from waste paper.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the need to create the Longevity Sutra, Gu Qingfeng would not even care much about the high-grade martial arts.</p><p></p><p>With his current methods, creating martial arts is completely easy.</p><p></p><p>While pondering and deducing the Longevity Sutra, Gu Qingfeng occasionally observed and contemplated the drop of blood he obtained from the Nine Turns Dao.</p><p></p><p>This blood contains immense and mysterious power. Even though this power is extremely evil and sinister, recklessly fusing with it could lead to one's downfall, or even transform into a new evil entity.</p><p></p><p>However, it is undeniable that this drop of blood contains great opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Among these profound Dao rhythms, Gu Qingfeng seemed to see the Buddha overlooking the world from the Nine Heavens again.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Buddha is terrifying. A single ray of divine light can even collapse the firmament.</p><p></p><p>Even with Gu Qingfeng's current cultivation realm, he still cannot truly comprehend the mysteries of this drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor who conquered the world thousands of years ago was the number one person under the heavens, and my current strength is also enough to rival the Martial Ancestor, but I still cannot comprehend the Dao rhythms of even a drop of blood. </p><p></p><p>Could the owner of this drop of blood truly be a divine Buddha above the Nine Heavens?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>It is evident that this drop of blood is not something that should exist in the Nine Realms.</p><p></p><p>Since ancient times, although there have been many powerful figures in the Nine Realms, they are not even a fraction of the owner of this blood.</p><p></p><p>Although he can only slowly research it, trying to glimpse a clue from the blood.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>In Guangyang Prefecture, the former Prefectural Governor's office has now been converted into a royal palace, serving as Gu Yang's current residence. </p><p></p><p>Although Gu Yang is the Manor Lord of the Gu Family Manor, the geographical location of Baishi Dao is not as good as the prefectural city. Furthermore, his identity has now changed, so he has to build a royal palace.</p><p></p><p>This so-called royal palace...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In reality, it was just a slight modification to the government office, without using too much manpower or resources.</p><p></p><p>On this day.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was being guided by Gu Yun in the cultivation of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Someone came in from outside and respectfully said, "Your Majesty, the Taixuan Dynasty has sent people to request an audience!"</p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Dynasty?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this name, Gu Yang's expression changed slightly, and he looked at Gu Yun beside him, whose expression also showed some surprise.</p><p></p><p>Soon after.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang calmly said, "You bring the people to the front hall and have them wait, this King will be there shortly."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>The person respectfully withdrew.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Gu Yun's expression became somewhat serious: "Your Majesty, the Taixuan Dynasty sending people over at this time must not be a simple matter, it's still best to be cautious!"</p><p></p><p>"With the Patriarch of the Ancient Sect here, I believe there won't be any major problems. Moreover, this is Taishan Prefecture, not the Central Plains, and the Taixuan Dynasty is on the decline, they won't dare to act recklessly here."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang smiled confidently, not showing much worry.</p><p></p><p>It's simple.</p><p></p><p>He had this confidence.</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Yang said, this is Taishan Prefecture, and it is also Guangyang Prefecture, the court's influence has not yet reached here.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the sudden arrival of the court's people, Gu Yang also felt a bit puzzled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>In the front hall.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang came in wearing white clothes, his handsome appearance exuding an overbearing aura that ordinary people did not possess.</p><p></p><p>The person originally sitting in the hall, upon seeing Gu Yang's arrival, his eyes lit up, and he immediately stood up and bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"I am Zhao Hai, paying respects to the King of Guangyang!"</p><p></p><p>The other party's voice was slightly soft and thin, and his appearance was pale and beardless, making his identity obvious.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang sat down in the main seat, and Gu Yun also sat beside him.</p><p></p><p>When Zhao Hai saw Gu Yun appear, his pupils contracted slightly, but quickly returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at the other party and calmly said, "I heard that you have come from the Central Plains, is this true?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, I have come from the Central Plains, on this trip I am acting on the Emperor's orders to meet with the King of Guangyang!"</p><p></p><p>"The King of Guangyang?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang suddenly smiled, picked up the tea cup beside him and took a sip, then slowly said, "This King has declared himself as King, in the eyes of the court I should be a rebel, Eunuch Zhao, if this matter spreads, won't the Emperor in the Central Plains be furious and blame me?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Hai's expression did not change, and he smiled slightly: "The King of Guangyang is joking, the rebel Pei Jinghu has caused chaos in Qingyun State, causing great suffering to the people, the King of Guangyang has stood up to stabilize the situation and restore peace to Taishan Prefecture, the Emperor has praised this greatly, how could it be considered a rebellion!"</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, the matter of you declaring yourself as King is trivial, on this trip I have brought the Emperor's edict, please take a look!"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Zhao Hai had already taken out the imperial edict from his bosom, intending to hand it to Gu Yang, but at the last moment changed his wording.</p><p></p><p>"Imperial edict?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang showed a slightly surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, he gestured with his eyes, and a servant immediately took the imperial edict from Zhao Hai's hand and handed it to Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>The latter opened the edict and looked at it, the previously calm expression on his face also underwent some subtle changes.</p><p></p><p>At this time.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Hai said, "The Emperor has appreciated your meritorious deeds, so he has appointed you as the King of Guangyang, and Taishan Prefecture is all under the jurisdiction of the King of Guangyang."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, there is another imperial edict, to be given to the Senior Gu Qingfeng, the Emperor wishes to appoint Senior Gu as the National Master of our Taixuan Dynasty, bestowing upon him the title of Martial Saint, and please convey this to Senior Gu as well!"(End of this chapter)</p>

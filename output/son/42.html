        <h1>Chapter 42</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was a middle-aged man with an ordinary appearance walking slowly. The city in front of him was quite lively, quite different from other places.</p><p></p><p>"The stability of Baishi City won't last too long. Once the Great Army of the Divine Martial King arrives, the peace here will be completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>I just hope the Gu family can be a bit more sensible, so that Baishi City can be spared from the ravages of war.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise—"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man's eyes grew cold as he thought about this.</p><p></p><p>Indeed!</p><p></p><p>He was Sitian.</p><p></p><p>Having received the order from the Divine Martial King, Sitian had come to Baishi City without delay. But because Baishi City was under the jurisdiction of Guangyang Prefecture in Taishan County, and the Taishan County Governor had strict control over the Black Mysterious Guard, Sitian had to pay a heavy price to safely enter Baishi City.</p><p></p><p>Now.</p><p></p><p>Having entered Baishi City.</p><p></p><p>The stable scene here was a stark contrast to Danyang County.</p><p></p><p>Danyang County was engulfed in war, with the common people living in constant fear. How could this place be so prosperous?</p><p></p><p>However—</p><p></p><p>All of this was only temporary.</p><p></p><p>In these chaotic times,</p><p></p><p>there is no true stability to speak of.</p><p></p><p>Once the Great Army of the Divine Martial King arrives, Baishi City, and even the entire Taishan County, will be consumed by the flames of war.</p><p></p><p>As for this situation, Sitian did not see any problem with it.</p><p></p><p>The same old saying.</p><p></p><p>The Taiyu Dynasty has already decayed.</p><p></p><p>This world should have a new master.</p><p></p><p>—</p><p></p><p>As night fell.</p><p></p><p>In the dead of night.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was tempering his muscles and bones. He was now cultivating the sect-protecting supreme skill of the Iron Bone Gang - the Chaos Iron Cloth!</p><p></p><p>This martial art was considered a top-tier intermediate-level skill. Its main focus was to refine the skin, muscles, and blood of the cultivator. If one could reach the pinnacle of perfection, they would enter the realm of Blood Refinement Perfection.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>If the Chaos Iron Cloth reached perfection, it could greatly enhance the cultivator's defensive capabilities, almost to the point of being impervious to fire and water.</p><p></p><p>Among them.</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Iron Cloth, like the Scorching Sun Divine Palm, was divided into nine levels of perfection.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the ninth level of perfection.</p><p></p><p>That was the realm of Blood Refinement Perfection.</p><p></p><p>Because Gu Qingfeng was originally a Bone Refining cultivator, with divine assistance, he had already perfected the first level of this intermediate-level skill in just a few days, and was about to enter the second level.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Due to Gu Qingfeng's Bone Refining cultivation, mastering this intermediate-level skill did not bring about much change to him.</p><p></p><p>In his opinion.</p><p></p><p>At least until he reached the fifth level of the Chaos Iron Cloth, would he begin to see significant changes within himself.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the darkness of night, several Blood Refining realm guards were holding iron batons and striking them forcefully against Gu Qingfeng's body. Despite his refined blood and muscles, which were sturdy enough to split mountains, the iron batons only left white marks on his bare skin.</p><p></p><p>After a long while.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's blood and qi surged, and all the iron batons striking him were repelled, causing the guards to involuntarily take several steps back, feeling a powerful force.</p><p></p><p>"That's enough for today, thank you all for your hard work!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled faintly, for just now, his Chaos Iron Cloth had broken through to the second level.</p><p></p><p>In his current state, he had not yet reached his limit, but since the others had assisted in his tempering, they had clearly given their full effort.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Peng!"</p><p></p><p>"At your service, master."</p><p></p><p>"Reward all of them with ten taels of silver as compensation for their hard work!"</p><p></p><p>"Understood, master."</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng cupped his fist in acknowledgment. The remaining guards also revealed smiles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, master, for the generous reward!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ten taels of silver may not seem like much to a Refining Blood Realm cultivator, but one must understand that this is just the daily labor fee.</p><p></p><p>If calculated over a month, that would be a full three hundred taels of silver.</p><p></p><p>Over the course of a year,</p><p></p><p>it would be over three thousand taels.</p><p></p><p>Even for a normal Refining Blood Realm cultivator, earning over three thousand taels is not an easy feat.</p><p></p><p>Although the few individuals felt exhausted, having the silver in hand made it all worthwhile.</p><p></p><p>Just as Meng Peng and the others were about to leave, Gu Qingfeng leisurely put on his clothes, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>"You have been watching for so long, why not come out and show yourself?"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, a dark shadow suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought that the esteemed Gu Clan Master is not a Refining Blood Realm cultivator, but has already stepped into the Refining Bone Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Being a fellow Refining Bone Realm cultivator, Si Tian naturally could tell that the Gu Qingfeng before him was not just a simple Refining Blood Realm cultivator, but had already advanced to the Refining Bone Realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression remained indifferent: "Who are you, and what is your purpose in coming here?"</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you Gu Clan Master take a guess?"</p><p></p><p>"Guess?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng suddenly smiled, but the smile seemed to send a chill down one's spine.</p><p></p><p>In the next instant, he had disappeared from his original spot, his 365 iron bones all vibrating, his powerful true qi bursting forth as he struck out with a palm strike as powerful as splitting a mountain towards Si Tian.</p><p></p><p>The latter's expression changed, completely unprepared for Gu Qingfeng to act so quickly, and could only hastily move to block.</p><p></p><p>Fists and palms collided.</p><p></p><p>A powerful force surged forth, accompanied by an scorching, irresistible aura, causing Si Tian's expression to change again.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Si Tian was forced to retreat several steps.</p><p></p><p>"With such strength, you dare to act recklessly in my Gu Clan, just who gave you the courage!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sneered disdainfully, the cultivator before him may have also reached the Refining Bone Realm, but his strength was nothing to speak of, completely insignificant.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Qingfeng about to strike again, Si Tian hurriedly said,</p><p></p><p>"I am a Hundred Banner of the Black Mystic Guard under the Divine Martial King, I have come here today on the orders of the Divine Martial King-"</p><p></p><p>Si Tian had not even finished speaking when Gu Qingfeng's attack arrived, like a sudden gale and torrential rain, forcing him to focus solely on defending, leaving no room to say anything else.</p><p></p><p>The more they fought, the more Si Tian's heart raced in fear.</p><p></p><p>He had cultivated his body to the point of having a complete Heavenly Copper Bone after entering the Refining Bone Realm for many years, and had even tempered a few Silver Bones, his strength placing him among the elites of the Refining Bone Realm.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>in the face of Gu Qingfeng, he was being completely suppressed.</p><p></p><p>The person before him had an extremely abundant true qi, not at all like a newly entered Refining Bone Realm cultivator, and Gu Qingfeng's fists and palms contained an extremely domineering and scorching aura.</p><p></p><p>This aura, as they fought, continuously invaded Si Tian's body, causing him great discomfort.</p><p></p><p>And when the aura had accumulated to a certain degree, it directly exploded within his body.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The Scorching Yang Palm Technique exploded.</p><p></p><p>Si Tian coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood, the gaps in his previous defensive techniques were instantly exposed, and he was directly struck by Gu Qingfeng's palm on his chest, sending his body flying.</p><p></p><p>After landing,</p><p></p><p>Si Tian coughed up another mouthful of blood, his entire body now in grave condition.</p><p></p><p>Such a commotion</p><p></p><p>naturally attracted the attention of the Gu Clan's people.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression turned cold as he sternly commanded, "You all disperse, this matter does not concern you!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words,</p><p></p><p>the many guards withdrew as instructed.</p><p></p><p>Then Gu Qingfeng approached Si Tian, leaning down and striking out with his hands like eagle claws, directly dislocating all the joints in his four limbs, the excruciating pain causing Si Tian's face to turn deathly pale, his forehead beading with cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

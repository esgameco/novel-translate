        <h1>Chapter 59</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Rear Mountain Cave</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng and Gu Yang arrived at this place, and there were also several guards here, and the expressions on everyone's faces were not very good.</p><p></p><p>When they saw the two arrive, several guards greeted them.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Master. Greetings, Young Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, what's the situation in there?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the entrance of the cave, which gave people an ominous feeling.</p><p></p><p>One of the guards said, "There are many corpses in the cave, some of which have already turned into white bones, and the remaining corpses are like mummies."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly, and then instructed these guards.</p><p></p><p>"You all stay here and guard this place, I'll go in and take a look."</p><p></p><p>Having said that,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng walked into the cave, and Gu Yang followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the two entered the cave, they felt their vision suddenly darken, but Gu Yang, the weakest of the two in cultivation, had already broken through the Blood Refining Realm, and seeing things at night was an easy task.</p><p></p><p>Even though the cave was dark, they could still see the scene inside clearly.</p><p></p><p>And as they went deeper into the cave, they saw that the surrounding stone walls were inlaid with luminous pearls, illuminating the gloomy cave.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>The scene in the cave was finally revealed to the two.</p><p></p><p>They saw corpses all over the ground, some turned into white bones, and some like mummies, the bloody and foul stench assaulting their senses, making them feel the urge to vomit.</p><p></p><p>This scene</p><p></p><p>Caused Gu Yang's face to turn slightly pale.</p><p></p><p>Although he had already tasted blood, and had killed many martial artists in the battle with the Qingyang Sect, when he saw such a scene, he still instinctively felt uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Only Gu Qingfeng's expression remained indifferent, not at all frightened by the sight before him.</p><p></p><p>Mere dead people, it's nothing.</p><p></p><p>"This should be the place where the Elder of the Qingyang Sect cultivated. Refining evil into the body to cultivate by sacrificing lives, it's truly a loss of one's nature, no different from livestock!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's voice was slightly cold, and with a slight force of his foot, the ground of the cave trembled, and countless cracks spread out from the center of his footprint to all directions.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's heart shook again.</p><p></p><p>Just a light step could achieve this extent, completely beyond the imagination of a Blood Refining Realm martial artist.</p><p></p><p>At this time,</p><p></p><p>As the ground cracked,</p><p></p><p>The two of them saw the exposed, grim white bones.</p><p></p><p>Clearly,</p><p></p><p>The bones here were not as simple as what was seen on the surface of the cave, but there were many more buried underneath.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng came to the place where the Elder of the Qingyang Sect cultivated, and carefully searched around, finally his gaze fell on a meditation cushion.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng felt around a bit, and immediately discovered something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>When he tore open the meditation cushion, a thin, yellowed secret manual appeared in his sight.</p><p></p><p>The secret manual looked like ordinary paper, but when held, it was completely different. Gu Qingfeng tried to tear it with a little force, but it didn't damage the secret manual at all.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that</p><p></p><p>The material of the secret manual was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>And on the cover of the secret manual, there were several large characters that caught their eye.</p><p></p><p>The Dao of Longevity!</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression did not change as he flipped through the secret manual to examine it. After a moment, he closed the secret manual again.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Dao of Longevity was essentially the same as the Spiritual Treasure Art, both being secret techniques that involved refining evil into the body.</p><p></p><p>From the secret techniques of the Dao of Longevity, Gu Qingfeng understood that the secret techniques mentioned here involved a type of evil spirit called the Yin Illusion.</p><p></p><p>Any secret technique that involves refining evil into the body is not universally applicable to all evil spirits, but is specifically targeted at a certain type of evil spirit.</p><p></p><p>From this, it can be seen that there are many types of evil spirits, and the Yin Illusion and the Heart-Devouring Demon are just two of them.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Among the two types.</p><p></p><p>Now. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div> The Patriarch of Azure Yang has fallen.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Ghosts contained within the opponent's body will also revive. If someone masters the secret technique of refining evil into the body, known as the Longevity Dao Classic, they can directly bear it and then transform into a Sorcerer.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>The Longevity Dao Classic has records about Sorcerers, which are much more detailed than the Spiritual Treasure Art.</p><p></p><p>In this.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has gained a deeper understanding of Sorcerers.</p><p></p><p>The first realm of Sorcerers is called Absorbing Spirits.</p><p></p><p>Above Absorbing Spirits is Condensing Spirits!</p><p></p><p>Above Condensing Spirits is Commanding Spirits!</p><p></p><p>Sorcerers at the Absorbing Spirits realm are equivalent to Blood Refining martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Sorcerers at the Condensing Spirits realm are equivalent to Bone Refining.</p><p></p><p>If one enters the Commanding Spirits realm, the weakest would be equivalent to Marrow Cleansing, while the strongest could rival Viscera Refining.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>The strength of Sorcerers is generally much greater than martial artists of the same realm. For example, a peak Absorbing Spirits Sorcerer can even slay a Bone Refining martial artist.</p><p></p><p>If a Sorcerer just enters the Commanding Spirits realm, they can also easily subdue a Marrow Cleansing martial artist.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case - the Patriarch of Azure Yang should not have broken through the Commanding Spirits realm!"</p><p></p><p>Judging from the fact that Sorcerers are much stronger than their martial artist counterparts, if the Patriarch of Azure Yang had broken through the Commanding Spirits realm, his strength would definitely not have been just that little bit.</p><p></p><p>In the previous battle.</p><p></p><p>Although the Patriarch of Azure Yang's strength was powerful, the feeling he gave Gu Qingfeng was just so-so.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of Azure Yang should only be at the peak of Condensing Spirits, or just stepping into the Commanding Spirits realm.</p><p></p><p>"The so-called Sorcerers are indeed not weak. Although I have slain one Patriarch of Azure Yang, I absolutely cannot be careless. In some ancient sects and aristocratic families, there may be Sorcerers at the Commanding Spirits level - "</p><p></p><p>Powerful Commanding Spirits Sorcerers can rival Viscera Refining martial artists.</p><p></p><p>If there are top-tier Commanding Spirits Sorcerers, they can even contend with Innate Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>At this level of strength, although Gu Qingfeng has entered the first realm of Viscera Refining, he does not have the real ability to deal with them.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>It is not easy to reach such a realm.</p><p></p><p>As can be seen, the Patriarch of Azure Yang spent hundreds of years, but only lingered in the Condensing Spirits realm, never stepping into the Commanding Spirits realm.</p><p></p><p>This shows that the breakthrough of Sorcerers is also fraught with difficulties.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stored the Longevity Dao Classic in his pouch.</p><p></p><p>He naturally had no intention of leaving this secret technique of refining evil into the body, but he did not destroy it either. Gu Qingfeng wanted to keep it and study it carefully, to see if he could find a way to deal with Sorcerers.</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang watched as Gu Qingfeng took away the Longevity Dao Classic, but did not say much.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng glanced at him.</p><p></p><p>"The so-called refining evil into the body is to suppress evil spirits and use the physical body to bear the seal of evil spirits, thereby grasping the powerful strength of the evil spirits."</p><p></p><p>"But once evil is refined into the body, one will be influenced by the power of the evil spirits, gradually losing one's human nature and using the blood and flesh of living beings as food."</p><p></p><p>"Like the skeletal remains before us, they were caused by the Patriarch of Azure Yang. I hope you will not go down this path in the future, and I also hope that no one in the Gu family will go down this path."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's words made Gu Yang's expression change, and he then said solemnly:</p><p></p><p>"Father, rest assured, I will definitely not refine evil into my body, and in the future I will not allow any descendants of the Gu family to refine evil into their bodies."</p><p></p><p>"That's the best!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded, then looked around the cave for a moment, and then left with Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the Longevity Dao Classic, there was nothing of value here, so there was no need to stay any longer.</p>

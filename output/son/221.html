        <h1>Chapter 221</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If a top-tier grand master were to take this beast elixir when breaking through the Divine Transformation Realm, they could have a better chance of succeeding in that breakthrough!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng played with the beast elixir in his hand, and some relevant information also appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The information left behind by Meng Rong was quite extensive, basically to ensure that one day, the people of the Divine Martial Sect could break through the jade slip's restrictions and obtain his legacy before truly leaving the Nine Provinces and heading to the Wasteland Primordial Realm. This way, they wouldn't make any fundamental mistakes.</p><p></p><p>There were records about beast elixirs, which was one such example.</p><p></p><p>Fierce beasts at the Divine Transformation Realm could condense beast elixirs.</p><p></p><p>However, directly consuming the beast elixir could be risky. While there was a chance of forcibly refining the power within the beast elixir for a significant boost in strength, there was also the possibility of being counterattacked by the elixir's power, leading to self-harm.</p><p></p><p>In severe cases, one could even be invaded by the will of the fierce beast within the elixir, becoming more bloodthirsty.</p><p></p><p>After all, beast elixirs were the concentrated essence of fierce beasts, filled with the most primal and violent power.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, if the beast elixir could be refined into a medicinal pill, that would be the best.</p><p></p><p>However, refining a beast elixir into a medicinal pill was not something an ordinary person could accomplish.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the flesh and blood of fierce beasts could also be of great use to cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The only problem was that each fierce beast was quite large in size, and Gu Qingfeng couldn't be bothered to take them out, so he simply killed them on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Judging from that purple-robed cultivator, he should be the so-called mysterious expert."</p><p></p><p>"From the memories of the Divine Transformation Realm fierce beast, this person's strength is at least at the peak of the Divine Transformation Realm, and he may even have stepped into the Dao Palace Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, his mere aura alone wouldn't have been enough to intimidate a Divine Transformation Realm fierce beast to the point of not daring to act rashly."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Transformation Realm fierce beast that Gu Qingfeng had casually slain was likely around the third level of the Divine Transformation Realm. For someone to be able to subdue such a fierce beast merely with their aura showed that their strength was not weak.</p><p></p><p>However, judging from Gu Xuan's demeanor, he didn't seem to be coerced, and the information panel indicated that Gu Xuan had been taken in as the other's disciple.</p><p></p><p>In that case, this could be considered a fortunate opportunity for Gu Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Well, then."</p><p></p><p>"A cultivator who is suspected to be at the ninth level of the Divine Transformation Realm likely has a powerful faction behind him. Having Xuan become his disciple may not necessarily be a bad thing."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng glanced at the information panel and felt at ease.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has received guidance from a Divine Transformation Realm ninth-level expert, and his strength has improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has received guidance from a Divine Transformation Realm ninth-level expert, and his understanding of the Heavenly Saber Dao has deepened!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has been cleansed by heavenly materials and earthly treasures, and his foundation has become even stronger!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The mysterious expert in the information panel had now directly become a Divine Transformation Realm ninth-level cultivator.</p><p></p><p>This showed that the term "mysterious" only appeared when Gu Qingfeng had not yet seen the other party in person. Once he encountered them face-to-face, their cultivation level would be directly displayed.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that as Gu Qingfeng's own cultivation improved, the information panel had also automatically optimized some of the details.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the words "Divine Transformation Realm ninth-level," it was clear confirmation of Gu Qingfeng's speculation.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Wasteland Primordial Realm, reaching the Divine Transformation Realm was considered a feat of a strong cultivator, and the Divine Transformation Realm ninth-level was among the strongest of the strong.</p><p></p><p>It was no wonder that Meng Rong, a Divine Transformation Realm ninth-level expert, had been chased and forced to flee to the Nine Provinces for refuge.</p><p></p><p>The reason for this was that Meng Rong carried the legacy of a Saint, which had drawn the attention of many ancient powers. Otherwise, with Meng Rong's Divine Transformation Realm ninth-level cultivation, he would not have been so hard-pressed, and he might even have been able to dominate the Wasteland Primordial Realm.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, Meng Rong had broken through to the Divine Transformation Realm ninth-level at a relatively young age, and if he had not been unexpectedly seriously injured and died, he would have had a clear path to eventually reaching the Dao Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the Holy Sun Sect under his control could have even regained its former glory.</p><p></p><p>However, any "if" is meaningless. If one's strength is insufficient, the opportunities will often turn into disasters.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng looked towards the depths of the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, the direction in which the purple-robed cultivator and Gu Xuan had left, but it had been several days already. Even if he tried to pursue them, it would be difficult to find their exact whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the Ancient Beast Mountain Range was not as simple as it seemed. During his previous spiritual sense sweep, Gu Qingfeng had sensed many powerful auras. With his current cultivation, confronting such existences would be a significant challenge.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Qingfeng decisively left. However, before departing, he took the opportunity to search and collect some rare heavenly materials and earthly treasures from the Nine Provinces that he himself had no use for, but others might.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng encountered two more fierce beasts, one at the fifth level of the Divine Transformation Realm and the other at the ninth level, just a step away from the Dao Palace Realm. This further reinforced Gu Qingfeng's wariness towards the Ancient Beast Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Gu Qingfeng directly unleashed his true Dao Palace Realm-level power, slapping the ninth-level Divine Transformation Realm fierce beast to death with a single palm strike.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng left the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, he had acquired a batch of heavenly materials and earthly treasures, as well as three beast elixirs: one at the third level of the Divine Transformation Realm, one at the fifth level, and the last one at the ninth level.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the sacred land of Taixu, there were many cultivators who had reached the ninth level of the Divine Transformation Realm, but throughout their entire lives until the end of their lifespans, they were unable to truly break through the shackles of the Divine Transformation Realm and step into the Dao Palace Realm.</p><p></p><p>"So many powerful experts have entered the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, it seems the rumors are not unfounded, and that opportunity might truly be within the Nine Provinces!"</p><p></p><p>Fu He murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>Hearing his words, Gu Xuan's expression changed once again.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what does this opportunity have to do with the Nine Provinces?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he said this, he instinctively had a bad premonition.</p><p></p><p>Fu He glanced at Gu Xuan and did not hide anything: "It is rumored that, tens of thousands of years ago, the Holy Solar Sect of the Eastern Domain once obtained the inheritance of a Saint, which later caused various forces to rise up and attack it. </p><p></p><p>In the end, the Holy Solar Sect was destroyed, but one of its true disciples managed to survive, carrying the inheritance of the Holy Solar Sect as well as the Saint's inheritance, disappearing without a trace."</p><p></p><p>"Since then, various forces have been searching for his whereabouts."</p><p></p><p>"Until a few years ago, there were reports that he might be hiding in the Nine Provinces, which is why many powerful experts have been entering the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, trying to find the whereabouts of the Nine Provinces."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the Ancient Beast Mountain Range is vast, and with the numerous ferocious beasts, no one has truly been able to cross the mountain range and find the location of the Nine Provinces in these past few years."</p><p></p><p>Fu He did not ask Gu Xuan about the location of the Nine Provinces, because the Ancient Beast Mountain Range was extremely easy to get lost in, and even if Gu Xuan came from the Nine Provinces, he would not be able to find his way back there now.</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>After hearing Fu He's words, Gu Xuan's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>He was not aware of the matter regarding the Saint's inheritance, nor had he heard of the Holy Solar Sect, but there was one thing that Gu Xuan understood very well.</p><p></p><p>That was, once these powerful experts from the Eastern Domain stepped into the Nine Provinces, they would undoubtedly cause no small amount of trouble.</p><p></p><p>The principle of the strong devouring the weak, how could Gu Xuan not understand it?</p><p></p><p>Even though he had always been staying in the Gu Family Village, he was well-versed in these matters.</p><p></p><p>If the Nine Provinces had the power to intimidate the various forces, it would be fine, but if not, it would be like a soft persimmon to be squeezed.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had already established the Divine Martial Empire.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Nine Provinces revered the Divine Martial Empire.</p><p></p><p>If the powerful experts from the Eastern Domain were to enter the Nine Provinces, regardless of whether they were targeting the Gu Family or not, the Divine Martial Empire would be the first to bear the brunt.</p><p></p><p>After hearing Fu He's words and understanding the situation in the Eastern Domain, Gu Xuan realized that even his own father, Gu Qingfeng, might only be a cultivator who had reached the Divine Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>Given Gu Qingfeng's strength, the consequences of facing these powerful experts from the Eastern Domain could be imagined.</p><p></p><p>"Please, Master, save my Gu Family!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan immediately bowed deeply to Fu He, his expression sincere.</p><p></p><p>Fu He's brow furrowed slightly, then smoothed out, and he said with a faint smile, "You can rest assured, even if the powerful experts from the Eastern Domain truly enter the Nine Provinces, they may not necessarily start indiscriminate slaughter."</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan maintained his bowing posture.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>Fu He's expression became serious, and he said, "Very well, you are a disciple of my Taixu Sacred Land, and I naturally will not sit idly by and watch your family's clan suffer a calamity.</p><p></p><p>My Taixu Sacred Land also has a certain reputation in the Eastern Domain, and I believe they will give me some face.</p><p></p><p>But the most pressing matter is still to find the location of the Nine Provinces."</p><p></p><p>Fu He had no particular thoughts about the Saint's inheritance, not because he was not tempted, but because he understood his own strength. Even if he obtained the Saint's inheritance, it would be difficult for him to keep it safe.</p><p></p><p>The reputation of the Taixu Sacred Land, although good, would be hard-pressed to intimidate other forces in the face of the Saint's inheritance.</p><p></p><p>Unless.</p><p></p><p>He could bring the inheritance back to the Taixu Sacred Land alive.</p><p></p><p>But in Fu He's eyes, this was a remote hope.</p><p></p><p>This time, because of the Saint's inheritance, even Dao Palace Realm experts had been alarmed, and as a mere cultivator at the peak of the Divine Transformation Realm, wanting to carry the Saint's inheritance away from the eyes of many powerful experts was simply a pipe dream.</p><p></p><p>More importantly.</p><p></p><p>What was being targeted now was not only the Saint's inheritance, but also the inheritance of the Holy Solar Sect itself.</p><p></p><p>After all, although the Holy Solar Sect was destroyed, it was undeniable that the Holy Solar Sect was once a formidable force, and the inheritance in its hands was naturally extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Originally.</p><p></p><p>Fu He had planned to get involved in this matter.</p><p></p><p>But now that Gu Xuan had spoken up, he could only agree.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Gu Family Village.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Whetstone Hall.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was currently in seclusion, contemplating the profundities of the Primordial Heavenly Saber.</p><p></p><p>His body was emanating a terrifying aura, with the power of his blood and qi permeating the air, as if manifesting the myriad of heavenly and earthly phenomena, possessing a colossal physique that defied the flow of time, and revealing the ancient and savage aura of the saber intent.</p><p></p><p>These various auras intertwined, covering the entire Whetstone Hall.</p><p></p><p>The numerous divine weapons, including the Slaughter Evil Saber, trembled slightly, both out of instinctive fear of this saber intent and a sense of indescribable delight.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand.</p><p></p><p>A small black flag was shivering, the remnants of its sinister aura filled with terror, as if it had seen a terrifying thing.</p><p></p><p>In the face of this saber intent, the malevolence of the Myriad Souls Flag was completely lost, as if there was a divine saber looming over it, ready to strike at any moment.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had long since ceased to pay attention to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Now, his entire mind and spirit were focused on the Primordial Heavenly Saber.</p><p></p><p>The Saint's inheritance that Mu Rong Xiu obtained from the secret realm was profoundly mysterious, and the moment Gu Qingfeng's spiritual sense entered it, a terrifying and ancient saber intent emerged.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, it was as if he had reversed the flow of time, returning to that savage and ancient era, where an invincible Saint wielded a divine saber, battling against the heavens and the earth, severing the ancient firmament.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was just a phantom, it made one's heart tremble.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Qingfeng had not already opened the Dao Palace and consolidated his primordial spirit, he might not have even had the qualifications to directly face and comprehend such a great Dao.</p><p></p><p>When contemplating the Primordial Heavenly Saber,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's physical body also emanated an ancient aura.</p><p></p><p>This power.</p><p></p><p>Came from the Primordial Immortal Body.</p><p></p><p>Although the aura of the Primordial Heavenly Saber was extremely ancient, it was still far inferior to the existence of the Primordial Immortal Body.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Primordial Immortal Body's bloodline power made the previously obscure and profound Dao insights much simpler to understand.</p><p></p><p>At that moment.</p><p></p><p>Various realizations surged in Gu Qingfeng's mind.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>Comprehend!</p><p></p><p>Comprehend to the fullest!</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not expect</p><p></p><p>that the Primordial Immortal Body he had obtained could bring such wonderful benefits.</p><p></p><p>Even when comprehending the Saint's supreme techniques, the Primordial Immortal Body would provide assistance.</p><p></p><p>The previously obscure and difficult-to-grasp Primordial Heavenly Saber had now become much easier to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this change, Gu Qingfeng naturally wanted to seize the opportunity and master the profundities of the Primordial Heavenly Saber as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>The Saint's supreme techniques!</p><p></p><p>Even if he could grasp just a sliver of their mysteries, it would greatly enhance his own strength.</p><p></p><p>After receiving the information left behind by Mu Rong Xiu, Gu Qingfeng had already understood that there were heavens beyond heavens, and powerful experts abounded in the Primordial Realm, and even those who had reached the Dao Palace Realm might not necessarily be able to act without restraint.</p><p></p><p>There was also another issue.</p><p></p><p>The problem of the Holy Solar Sect was still a hidden danger.</p><p></p><p>The Saint's inheritance was tempting.</p><p></p><p>Although Mu Rong Xiu had already died thousands of years ago, and the Saint's inheritance had fallen into his own hands, in Gu Qingfeng's eyes, this was a ticking time bomb.</p><p></p><p>Who could guarantee that the forces that had once destroyed the Holy Solar Sect, forcing Mu Rong Xiu to flee to the Nine Provinces and eke out a living, would not discover the latter's hiding place in the Nine Provinces?</p><p></p><p>Even though the probability was small, it could not be completely ignored.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng naturally wanted to enhance his own strength as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Dao Palace Realm, ninth level!</p><p>Saint Realm, ninth level!</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the waters of the Primordial Realm were not to be taken lightly.</p><p></p><p>……</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, a message has come from Tian Xiong Pass, saying that ferocious beasts have run amok from the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, causing calamity in the region and resulting in the deaths of many commoners!"</p><p></p><p>In the imperial court, a minister spoke in a solemn tone.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang's expression turned cold. "Shi Zhen!"</p><p></p><p>"I am here, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"I command you to immediately lead the Heavenly Roc Army to Tian Xiong Pass to suppress the ferocious beasts!"</p><p></p><p>"I will obey the order!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhen's expression was grave as he accepted the command.</p><p></p><p>The rampaging beasts from the Ancient Beast Mountain Range were a well-known issue, but Shi Zhen was not afraid.</p><p></p><p>After all, his current cultivation had already reached the peak of the Grand Ancestor Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the strength of the Heavenly Roc Army under his command had also undergone various breakthroughs, and the original Heavenly Roc Divine Calamity Formation had been further improved.</p><p></p><p>With this,</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhen would have a chance to contend even against experts at the Spiritual Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Shi Zhen leave after receiving the order, Gu Yang looked at the other ministers and said, "In recent times, there have been frequent reports of ferocious beasts causing trouble in the Nine Provinces. It seems there may be some changes in the Ancient Beast Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>Pass my order, have people investigate the situation in the Ancient Beast Mountain Range to see what has caused the beasts to become so unruly.</p><p></p><p>Whoever can uncover this information will be greatly rewarded by Us."</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of who can clarify this matter, they will be rewarded with ten thousand taels of silver, as well as a supreme Grand Ancestor technique!"</p><p></p><p>These words caused an uproar among the court officials.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand taels of silver!</p><p></p><p>They might not be too concerned about that.</p><p></p><p>But a supreme Grand Ancestor technique, that was a different story.</p><p></p><p>At the level of martial arts, even in the imperial court, it could captivate the hearts of most people.</p><p></p><p>In the current world where the martial dao was flourishing, one must have a certain cultivation base to be eligible for an official position.</p><p></p><p>Similarly.</p><p></p><p>This was also the standard Gu Yang used to select officials.</p><p></p><p>Ability! Cultivation!</p><p></p><p>Both were indispensable.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the current world, ordinary commoners, no matter how talented and capable they were, would find it difficult to truly safeguard themselves, as it was easy to eliminate a mere mortal.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the expressions of the officials below, Gu Yang paused for a moment, then continued, "In the past, there were evil spirits causing chaos in the world, which was due to the inaction of the previous dynasty, as well as the weakness of the common people.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, I intend to emulate the Martial Ancestor from thousands of years ago, and establish academies throughout the Nine Provinces, spreading the martial dao. All citizens of our Divine Martial Empire who are between the ages of six and eighteen shall be allowed to enroll in these academies and receive martial arts instruction!"</p><p></p><p>"I only hope that all under heaven will be like dragons!"</p><p></p><p>These words caused a commotion among everyone present.</p><p></p><p>Afterward,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at a middle-aged Confucian scholar and said, "Yan Yun, this matter will be entrusted to you at the National University to oversee. You shall also serve as the principal of the Divine Martial Academy. I want to see the Divine Martial Academy established in various parts of the Nine Provinces within a year!"</p><p></p><p>"I will dutifully carry out Your Majesty's orders!" </p><p></p><p>Yan Yun responded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

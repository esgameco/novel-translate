        <h1>Chapter 77</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Now, it is a scene of mourning.</p><p></p><p>Numerous corpses were lying there, each with a rigid, terrified expression, as if they had seen a terrifying existence before their death.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall of the Zhenyang Sect, the wails of a woman and the frenzied, brutal laughter could be heard.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Zhenyang Sect, an old man, now had his four limbs twisted and broken, lying on the ground like a pile of rotten mud, his eyes bulging as he witnessed the unfolding scene.</p><p></p><p>A young woman in her prime had her limbs twisted and was being ruthlessly violated by a young man.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the young man's face revealed a satisfied smile, and he then casually snapped the woman's neck, throwing her lifeless body in front of the Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>"Good, I didn't expect this small place of Baishi Dao to have such a rare specimen, not bad, truly not bad!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Fu licked his lips, looking at the woman's corpse, still not fully satisfied.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch's eyes were bloodshot as he roared angrily, "This is Baishi Dao, and you dare to wantonly destroy my Zhenyang Sect. The Gu Family Manor will not let you off!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, what Gu Family Manor? They are just ordinary martial artists, what can they do?" Ning Fu sneered, his gaze towards the Patriarch filled with cruelty.</p><p></p><p>"I've kept you alive until now because you are the only Qi Refinement realm martial artist in the Zhenyang Sect. I'll savor you last, for the blood and flesh of a Qi Refinement realm martial artist is not something ordinary people can compare to.</p><p></p><p>Consuming you, I might be able to further advance my cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>Although he was not a cultivator, he had practiced the divine arts of the Chiyun Sect, nourishing his body with the qi and blood of martial artists, cultivating himself to a semi-spiritual state.</p><p></p><p>In this way, when he truly refines the demonic arts, it will be much easier.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Ning Fu slowly approached the Patriarch, then bent down and, under the Patriarch's furious gaze, directly pierced his chest and extracted the heart from within.</p><p></p><p>"I come from the Chiyun Sect, and even if the Gu Family Manor's people are here, do they have the courage to touch me?"</p><p></p><p>"What audacious villain dares to speak such words? Perish!"</p><p></p><p>Just as Ning Fu finished speaking, a furious roar came from outside the hall, and a terrifying blade intent erupted, the sharp sword qi piercing into the hall, causing Ning Fu's expression to change drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Fu had just made a move when he was blasted away by a powerful force.</p><p></p><p>"Pu-chi!"</p><p></p><p>An arm flew off, and the intense pain twisted Ning Fu's face.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he saw a young man holding a sword calmly walking into the hall.</p><p></p><p>"Gu... Gu Young Master, please... please avenge... my Zhenyang Sect..."</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch's pupils dilated, his lips moving weakly, but his expression soon froze, and he breathed no more.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ning Fu, his left hand clutching his severed arm, looked at Gu Yang with fear in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"You are Gu Yang... impossible, you are only at the initial Qi Refinement realm, how could you have such strength!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Fu couldn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>He knew of the existence of the Gu Family's young master, Gu Yang, and although the latter had a reputation for talent, he was only at the initial Qi Refinement realm.</p><p></p><p>Ning Fu himself, in his twenties, had already reached the peak of the Qi Refinement realm and qualified to break through to the Bone Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>But what truly shocked Ning Fu was the strength Gu Yang had just displayed.</p><p></p><p>That single strike, Ning Fu had no ability to resist at all.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Yang's cold expression as he slowly approached, holding the sword, Ning Fu's face suddenly became filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Fierce.</p><p></p><p>"You cannot kill me, for I am the true inheritor of the Crimson Flame Sect. If you kill me, the Crimson Flame Sect will not let you off—"</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Before Ning Fu could finish his words.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had already swung his blade. The domineering and tyrannical sword intent of the Overlord Blade Slash, which was unleashed with his full essence and spirit, directly pierced into Ning Fu's mind, leaving him completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment.</p><p></p><p>The long sword sliced through the air.</p><p></p><p>Ning Fu's body stiffened, and his severed head flew out, his frozen expression still bearing a look of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Clearly.</p><p></p><p>He had not expected that Gu Yang, despite knowing his identity, would still dare to kill him.</p><p></p><p>After slaying Ning Fu.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang sheathed his sword.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the corpse of the Elder Zhenyang and the mess in the main hall, and his calm expression turned gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"The Crimson Yang Sect—"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's eyes turned icy cold.</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family Manor ruled over the White Stone Path, and the Zhenyang Sect was also a vassal force under the Gu Family Manor. Therefore, upon learning of the issues within the Zhenyang Sect, Gu Yang immediately led his people to this place.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly.</p><p></p><p>He had arrived a step too late.</p><p></p><p>Elder Zhenyang had perished.</p><p></p><p>The Zhenyang Sect had been virtually wiped out.</p><p></p><p>It was only at this moment.</p><p></p><p>That the other outer disciples of the Gu Family Manor arrived at the scene.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the scene in the main hall, their expressions also faltered.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang asked, "Are there any survivors from the Zhenyang Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Young Master, the Zhenyang Sect had a total of 369 people, and aside from the ones who informed us, all the others have perished."</p><p></p><p>An outer disciple said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Clean up everything!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang took one last look at the scene in the main hall and then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>The matter of the Zhenyang Sect made him realize even more that only by possessing sufficient strength could one survive in this chaotic world.</p><p></p><p>"The strong ruthlessly slaughter the weak!"</p><p></p><p>"In this chaotic world, the moral order has collapsed, just as my father said, the order of this world has already decayed!"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps only by overthrowing this decaying world can a complete order be re-established—"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's gaze gradually became more resolute.</p><p></p><p>—</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain a Refined Blood Perfected Martial Artist!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has gained insight into his true nature!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang's' understanding of the Overlord Blade Slash has deepened, and his strength has continued to progress!"</p><p></p><p>After just observing the Sect Master's True Intent, the exhaustion of Gu Qingfeng's spiritual power had caused him to temporarily rest.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>He instinctively opened the information panel, wanting to see if there were any new updates.</p><p></p><p>After all, the information panel would update every now and then, and it wouldn't hurt to take a look.</p><p></p><p>But this time, when Gu Qingfeng opened the information panel and saw the refreshed aura, his expression couldn't help but falter.</p><p></p><p>Refined Blood Perfected?</p><p></p><p>Has his son really become so courageous? Even Gu Qingfeng didn't expect that Gu Yang would actually be able to slay a Refined Blood Perfected Martial Artist.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Compared to this matter, Gu Qingfeng was more curious about who the Refined Blood Perfected Martial Artist that Gu Yang had slain was, and what kind of conflict had arisen between the two.</p><p></p><p>Immediately.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng didn't have the leisure to sit around, and he directly instructed his subordinates to investigate Gu Yang's whereabouts and bring the other party to him.</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng soon had a report in his hands, which clearly contained news about the Zhenyang Sect.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

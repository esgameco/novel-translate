        <h1>Chapter 60</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There were people who discovered a mass grave in the back mountains of the Qingyang Sect.</p><p></p><p>If the bones in the cave were numerous, then the bodies in the mass grave were truly densely packed, completely dwarfing the former in comparison.</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng looked at the many corpses in the mass grave, his expression solemn.</p><p></p><p>"The Qingyang Sect is quite renowned in the jianghu, yet their methods turned out to be so cruel. The number of people who perished in this pit must be no less than tens of thousands!"</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands?</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The number might even be several times that.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Qingyang Patriarch had lived for hundreds of years, so the number of people he had killed must be astronomical.</p><p></p><p>From this, one could see the true nature of the sects and powerful families in the world.</p><p></p><p>This Qingyang Sect was a microcosm of the entire realm.</p><p></p><p>And this small Qingyang Patriarch was already soaked in so much blood. Some even more ancient existences, as well as the Zhenxie Bureau in the court, must be stained with even more shocking amounts of blood.</p><p></p><p>All these thoughts flashed through Gu Qingfeng's mind, before his expression became indifferent once more.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>The Qingyang Sect had been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to linger here any longer.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, Gu Qingfeng led the Gu family guards in departing the Qingyang Sect. This time, three hundred guards had been dispatched, and around thirty to forty of them had fallen in the battle against the Qingyang Sect - a relatively low loss, considering the Qingyang Sect had been rampant in Guangyang Prefecture for many years, with numerous powerful experts within their sect. The Gu family guards, being mostly wandering cultivators, had managed to achieve this feat.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the reason for this was that all the Qingyang Sect's top experts had been slain by Gu Qingfeng alone. Otherwise, even three thousand guards would not have been enough to defeat the Qingyang Sect.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng led the Gu family guards back to Baishi City, the news shook the entire Baishi Path. Previously, there had been rumors that the Gu family's target was the Qingyang Sect. Now, the Gu family's warriors had returned, with some bearing injuries, indicating a fierce battle. This meant that the Qingyang Sect had been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>This was a shocking revelation, as the Qingyang Sect was not like the minor Qin Family Iron Bone Gang, but a major sect in Guangyang Prefecture, with Refining Bone experts guarding it, and not just one. The Gu family, no matter how strong, should not have been able to defeat the Qingyang Sect.</p><p></p><p>For the moment, various factions were filled with doubt and uncertainty. However, with the Gu family's experts returning, the forces that had been restless now quieted down. Regardless of how the battle with the Qingyang Sect had gone, the Gu family was the true power in the Baishi Path.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng paid no heed to the outside affairs. When he returned to the Gu family, Xu Yulan had been waiting for him. Seeing him return, her delicate face visibly relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"You're back!"</p><p></p><p>The many words she wanted to say were condensed into this simple sentence.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I'm back, and I have something to give you."</p><p></p><p>"What is it?" Xu Yulan asked, her expression puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not elaborate further, but went to wash up.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After a while, he then spent some time in intimate embrace with Xu Yulan.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took out a bottle of elixir.</p><p></p><p>"This is a Breakthrough Elixir. Cultivators at the Blood Refinement Realm and below can benefit from it. There are seven Breakthrough Elixirs here, which should be enough for you to break through to the peak of the Blood Refinement Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Previously.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had planned to directly give the Breakthrough Elixir to Gu Yang for him to use.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, after he fully understood the function of the Breakthrough Elixir, he gave up on this idea.</p><p></p><p>It's simple.</p><p></p><p>If the offspring uses the Breakthrough Elixir to break through the realm, Gu Qingfeng himself would not be able to receive any rewards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had to abandon this kind of "nested doll" situation.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yulan was only at the initial stage of Skin Refinement, and her martial dao cultivation was somewhat lagging behind his own.</p><p></p><p>Since it's the case, </p><p></p><p>providing her with some Breakthrough Elixirs to cultivate would be the perfect solution to this problem.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the day,</p><p></p><p>Xu Yulan's martial talent was quite average.</p><p></p><p>If there were no other fortuitous encounters, she might never have the chance to break through to the Blood Refinement Realm in her entire life.</p><p></p><p>Even if she forcibly advanced to the Blood Refinement Realm, her future potential would be limited to that.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>the Breakthrough Elixir is different.</p><p></p><p>Although this elixir is called a "Breakthrough Elixir", it will not make the cultivator's foundation unstable, unlike self-cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After understanding the efficacy of the Breakthrough Elixir, Xu Yulan's expression changed slightly, and she shook her head to refuse.</p><p></p><p>"My humble talents are low, and it would be a waste to use such a precious item. It's better to leave it for Yang'er. Yang'er has exceptional talents and martial cultivation aptitude.</p><p></p><p>With such an elixir, I believe he can break through to the Bone Refinement Realm much faster, and he can then assist my husband in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Yang'er has his own path to walk. Your aptitude is a bit inferior, and if you don't break through with the elixir, your future accomplishments will be limited. Martial cultivators can prolong their lifespan, but Skin Refinement Realm cultivators are not much different from ordinary people."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head, then handed the Blood Refinement Elixir to Xu Yulan, and immediately afterwards, he also imparted the Scorching Sun Divine Palm and the Heavenly Thunder Sword Technique to her.</p><p></p><p>The former is a top-tier intermediate martial art that can build a solid foundation. As long as Xu Yulan can cultivate it to the perfection realm, even if her aptitude is poor, the characteristics of the Scorching Sun Divine Palm will allow her to slowly break through to the Bone Refinement Realm.</p><p></p><p>This is why Gu Qingfeng valued the Scorching Sun Divine Palm so much.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes,</p><p></p><p>many superior martial arts are not comparable to the Scorching Sun Divine Palm.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention anything else,</p><p></p><p>the ability to independently advance to the Bone Refinement Realm is something that ordinary martial arts cannot match.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p></p><p>Xu Yulan no longer said much.</p><p></p><p>Having the opportunity to become stronger is an excellent thing.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Yulan had been staying at home to support her husband and educate the children all these years, this world ultimately values the martial dao, and martial cultivation can also prolong one's lifespan. It would be impossible for her to not feel any excitement about it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng dealt with the affairs of the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>This time, after eliminating the Azure Yang Sect, the Gu family confiscated a considerable amount of martial arts and resources, including even five thousand taels of gold.</p><p></p><p>Not bad.</p><p></p><p>It was gold.</p><p></p><p>Last time, the three thousand taels of gold were used by Gu Qingfeng to forge a golden coffin, sealing the Yin Phantom inside. Now, with an additional five thousand taels of gold, it means that if the Gu family encounters other evil entities in the future, they will have the ability to seal them again.</p><p></p><p>"Gold is a material for sealing objects. Next time, if I need to seal an evil entity, I may not need to be as extravagant as before, and can directly create a golden coffin. As long as I can put the evil entity inside, that should be enough!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>In this way,</p><p>the five thousand taels of gold can be utilized in many ways.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sat at the head position, with Gu Yang and Meng Peng sitting in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Yang was only thirteen years old, his figure had become more upright, and his slightly youthful face was handsome, resembling Gu Qingfeng's appearance in his younger days by about 80%.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, there was an aura of iron and blood around him, which was not typical of someone his age.</p><p></p><p>The reason for this was that in recent years, Gu Qingfeng had rarely interfered in the affairs of the Gu family. All the family matters were handled by Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>In the beginning, Gu Qingfeng would still provide guidance from the sidelines. But a year later, he had completely delegated the authority and no longer got involved.</p><p></p><p>The vast Gu family, from top to bottom, was basically managed by Gu Yang. Only the matters that Gu Yang could not resolve were handled by Gu Qingfeng personally.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of this was to quickly cultivate Gu Yang, allowing him to stand on his own.</p><p></p><p>The facts proved that Gu Qingfeng's approach was not wrong. Under Gu Yang's management, the various industries of the Gu family were well-organized, and with Meng Peng's assistance, the reputation of this young master of the Gu family had become quite significant in the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>"Speak, what has happened?" Gu Qingfeng sipped his tea and asked the two calmly.</p><p></p><p>Upon his words, Gu Yang was the first to speak, "Father, a few days ago, several of our Gu family's stores and industries were attacked and vandalized by unknown warriors, resulting in the deaths of more than ten people. After investigation, I found that the shadows of the Lu family were behind these incidents."</p><p></p><p>"The Lu family?" Gu Qingfeng's eyes narrowed slightly. "Are you referring to the Lu family led by the self-proclaimed 'Thunderbolt Sword' Lu Tianxiong?"</p><p></p><p>The Thunderbolt Sword Lu Tianxiong! He was the patriarch of the Lu family, a powerful cultivator who had reached the intermediate Blood Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang nodded, "Father is correct, it is the Lu family led by Lu Tianxiong."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Gu family has been low-key in our actions over the years, surely the Lu family doesn't have the audacity to make a move against us, right?" Gu Qingfeng asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, although the Gu family had been low-key, whenever Gu Qingfeng acted, he had displayed formidable strength. Normally, the Lu family, despite their background, would not rashly provoke the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Gu family and the Lu family did not have any enmity between them.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said, "According to my investigation, the Lu family is backed by the Iron Bone Gang. This attack on our Gu family is not just the Lu family's doing, but the intention of the Iron Bone Gang."</p><p></p><p>"The Iron Bone Gang?" Gu Qingfeng's expression changed slightly when he heard these three words, and all his doubts were suddenly clarified.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Meng Peng spoke in a low voice, "Master, the Iron Bone Gang has been collaborating with the Heavenly Cloud Sect in recent years, and they have already driven the Qin family to the brink of destruction. Now, the Iron Bone Gang's ambition to dominate the Baishi Road is already evident.</p><p></p><p>A while ago, the Iron Bone Gang sent people to our Gu family, hoping that we would join them in attacking the Qin family, but we refused. It seems that they have been harboring a grudge since then. If we don't find a solution, the consequences will be severe!"</p><p></p><p>"The Iron Bone Gang..." Gu Qingfeng's eyes turned cold, and a murderous aura seemed to emanate from him, but it quickly subsided.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Gu Yang and asked calmly, "Yangzi, you have broken through the Refining Skin realm for many years. I can sense that your aura is stable, so I imagine you will soon break through to the Refining Skin Perfection realm, am I right?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Father..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If you can break through in three more months, the child will definitely be able to do it."</p><p></p><p>"In one month, I want you to break through for your father, no matter what price you have to pay or how many resources you need to invest. Within one month, I want to see you break through the Refining Skin realm perfectly."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng spoke word by word. His words made Gu Yang's expression change, and then he nodded: "I understand, child. It's just that the matter with the Chu family..."</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry about the Chu family for now. Before you break through the Refining Skin realm perfectly, you should keep a low profile. After you break through, I will settle the accounts with them."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's words made Gu Yang even more puzzled. He didn't understand why dealing with the Chu family was related to his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Yang didn't ask about these things. In his heart, Gu Qingfeng was the true anchor, and since the other party had spoken, the problem with the Chu family was no longer a problem.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the two left.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sat alone in the hall, his eyes slightly cold.</p><p></p><p>"The Chu family... the Iron Bone Gang, it's really like a tree wanting to be still but the wind won't stop. I just want to act low-key and not get involved in the conflicts in the jianghu. Why do you all keep pressing me!"</p><p></p><p>All along, Gu Qingfeng didn't want to get too involved in the affairs of the jianghu. After all, for him, nothing was more important than quietly cultivating and improving his strength.</p><p></p><p>He just needed to manage the small plot of the Gu family well, quietly develop the clan, and give Gu Yang enough time to grow.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Gu Qingfeng found that he was still too naive.</p><p></p><p>Where there are people, there is the jianghu. Even if the Gu family wants to be low-key, there will always be people who don't want the Gu family to stay low-key.</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, then the Gu family doesn't need to continue to be low-key.</p><p></p><p>After three years of precipitation, Gu Qingfeng was quite confident in his own strength, especially after breaking through the fourth realm of the Scorching Sun Divine Palm, which had taken his strength to a new level.</p><p></p><p>However, the Iron Bone Gang's leader, nicknamed the Invincible Divine Fist, had entered the Refining Blood realm many years ago. Although Gu Qingfeng was confident that he could suppress the other party by five parts, it was still not safe enough.</p><p></p><p>So he had to wait. Wait until Gu Yang truly broke through. As long as Gu Yang broke through, Gu Qingfeng would have the confidence to rely on the gained improvement points to further enhance his own strength.</p><p></p><p>That would be the best time to settle accounts with the Chu family and the Iron Bone Gang.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>In a private room of a certain restaurant, the voices of singing girls were endless.</p><p></p><p>Several people were indulging in pleasure here, led by a middle-aged burly man with a square face. His temples were bulging, and his bronze skin seemed to contain a terrifying power. His finger bones were thick, and his palms were covered with thick calluses.</p><p></p><p>This person was none other than Luo Yu, the leader of the Iron Bone Gang.</p><p></p><p>By Luo Yu's side was an old man in brocade clothes, who was the Chu family patriarch, nicknamed the Thunderbolt Sword, Chu Tianxiong.</p><p></p><p>Now, Chu Tianxiong was frequently toasting Luo Yu, his old face full of awe and flattery.</p><p></p><p>"The Iron Bone Gang is now at the peak of its power. I believe it won't be long before the Qin family will be completely destroyed. I'd like to congratulate the Gang Leader Luo in advance!"</p><p></p><p>"The Chu family is too polite. If the Iron Bone Gang can unify the Baishi Road, I won't forget the Chu family's contribution."</p><p></p><p>Luo Yu smiled slightly. His words made Chu Tianxiong's smile even more radiant.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

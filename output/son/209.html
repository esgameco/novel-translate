        <h1>Chapter 209</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was a middle-aged man sitting in the main seat, facing a person dressed in brocade robes. The person had a prominent nose bridge and a chiseled, heroic face that exuded a sense of steadiness and majesty. His gaze was like a blazing torch, as if he could see into the depths of one's heart.</p><p></p><p>This person was the current Ling King.</p><p></p><p>Below.</p><p></p><p>Now, a subordinate was reporting news regarding Qingyun State.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty the Ling King, the scouts have reported that the King of Guangyang has already gathered an army of two million troops in Taishan Prefecture, a formidable force!"</p><p></p><p>"Two million troops..."</p><p></p><p>The Ling King narrowed his eyes, but his expression did not show much anxiety.</p><p></p><p>According to his understanding, the maximum army under the King of Guangyang's command was only about three million, and the four prefectures of Qingyun State should have their own armies to defend them. So, in the Ling King's view, the fact that the other party could mobilize two million troops was completely within his expectations.</p><p></p><p>Such a force would have been considered quite powerful among the many feudal lords in the past.</p><p></p><p>After all, being able to muster two million troops at once was no easy feat.</p><p></p><p>But the situation was different now.</p><p></p><p>The powerful cultivators of Taisuzu had taken action.</p><p></p><p>The various feudal lords had almost been completely subdued in the Central Plains.</p><p></p><p>The Ling King had seized this opportunity to absorb the remaining forces of these feudal lords, and now his own army had grown exponentially. For this attack on Qingyun State, he had personally led a force of five hundred thousand troops.</p><p></p><p>Under such an overwhelming military advantage, the Ling King could only say that the advantage was on his side.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the person below and asked in a deep voice, "What about that Martial Saint? Has he made any moves?"</p><p></p><p>"According to the reports, that Martial Saint has already departed from the Gu Family Manor."</p><p></p><p>"Good, keep exploring and report back!"</p><p></p><p>The Ling King waved his hand, and the person respectfully retreated.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>The Ling King looked at the person sitting beside him, his expression becoming much more reverential: "Venerable Elder, if all goes as expected, the Martial Saint behind the King of Guangyang will also personally take action. Such a powerful expert, I'm afraid we'll have to rely on you to resolve this!"</p><p></p><p>Since he was a direct disciple of Taisuzu, the Ling King also respectfully addressed Fu Zhao as the Venerable Elder.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Fu Zhao opened his eyes, and a faint trace of blood seemed to appear, only to quickly disappear.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, a mere martial cultivator can't turn the tide. Not to mention a so-called Martial Saint, even if the Martial Ancestor from a thousand years ago were to be reborn, I, the elder, can still subdue and kill him!"</p><p></p><p>This, Fu Zhao was absolutely confident about.</p><p></p><p>He had slaughtered countless living beings in the Central Plains, including many Grandmasters and Fusion Spirit Realm experts. The vast amount of spiritual energy and blood had not only stabilized Fu Zhao's realm, but had also directly propelled him to the middle stage of the Penetrating Deity Realm.</p><p></p><p>For a cultivator in the Penetrating Deity Realm, even a small-scale breakthrough could bring about a significant change in their strength.</p><p></p><p>Compared to when he first entered the Penetrating Deity Realm, Fu Zhao's current strength had undoubtedly grown stronger.</p><p></p><p>In his view, the battle for Qingyun State would have no surprises.</p><p></p><p>Once Taisuzu controlled the Nine Provinces, all the living beings in the Nine Provinces would become his sustenance.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Fu Zhao could seize the opportunity to break through the limits of the Penetrating Deity Realm and step into a realm that no cultivator had ever reached before.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Fu Zhao's heart was filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>It was said that cultivators had the hope of achieving immortality.</p><p></p><p>But the Penetrating Deity Realm could only live for five thousand years.</p><p></p><p>However, if he could break through the barrier of the Penetrating Deity Realm, perhaps he could truly glimpse the secrets of eternal life.</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>After receiving Fu Zhao's affirmative answer, the Ling King's fear towards Gu Qingfeng had dissipated considerably.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, he directly issued the order, leading the army to march towards Taishan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Taishan Prefecture, at the Great Tong Prefecture, at the Tianxiong Pass.</p><p></p><p>Here, the battle flags were fluttering, and hundreds of thousands of troops were stationed, with an oppressive aura of killing intent permeating the air, making people feel inexplicably depressed.</p><p></p><p>On the towering and majestic city walls, Gu Qingfeng looked towards the distance, seeing that outside the Tianxiong Pass was a vast plain, with the Great River on one side and the vast forest on the other.</p><p></p><p>By his side, Gu Yun was attending him.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianxiong Pass is the gateway to the entire Great Tong Prefecture, and it is also a crucial location in Taishan Prefecture. The river on the right is called the Yulong River, and it is said that in ancient times, a true dragon once appeared, hence the name.</p><p></p><p>This river is swift and the river surface is wide. Even with war vessels, it would be difficult to cross it safely.</p><p></p><p>The mountain range on the left is the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, where not only are there numerous poisonous insects, but there are also rumored to be some incredibly powerful and ferocious beasts within, to the point that even Grandmasters may not be able to safely venture out of it. Moreover, the Ancient Beast Mountain Range is vast, spanning across multiple states.</p><p></p><p>So if the Ling King's army really comes, the only option would be to directly attack the Tianxiong Pass. As for bypassing the Ancient Beast Mountain Range or crossing the Yulong River, those are unrealistic."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun spoke slowly, sharing the information he knew.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng, upon hearing this, raised his brows and looked at the surging river, as if there was a true dragon stirring up the winds and clouds within the water.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that in the ancient times, a true dragon really appeared here?"</p><p></p><p>"The legend of the true dragon is purely hearsay. Whether a true dragon really existed, no one can know for sure, as it has been over ten thousand years since those ancient times.</p><p></p><p>After such a long period, many things have been buried in the river of time.</p><p></p><p>However, in my opinion, the true dragon is something that only exists in legends and tales, and is likely just a fabrication by later generations!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng neither agreed nor disagreed with his words.</p><p></p><p>But just as Gu Yun said, the events of the ancient times could be traced back thousands of years, and it was impossible to determine the truth.</p><p></p><p>As for the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, Gu Qingfeng had some understanding of it.</p><p></p><p>It was an ancient mountain range that spanned across multiple states, with numerous dangers, including the existence of incredibly powerful beasts that could even pose a threat to Grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>Throughout history, successive dynasties had placed great importance on the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, as occasionally some powerful beasts would surge out from it, causing no small impact.</p><p></p><p>So, both the Yulong River and the Ancient Beast Mountain Range could be considered natural barriers.</p><p></p><p>And it was precisely because of these barriers that the location of the Tianxiong Pass became even more crucial.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Yang had led the army to station at the Tianxiong Pass, there had been scouts coming to report almost every half an hour.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the report is that the Ling King has personally led an army of five hundred thousand troops and is marching towards Taishan Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the Ling King's army is only five hundred li away from the Tianxiong Pass!"</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the Ling King's army is only three hundred li away from the Tianxiong Pass!"</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the Ling King's army is only one hundred li away from the Tianxiong Pass!"</p><p></p><p>One after another, these messages arrived, and Gu Yang looked towards the Tianxiong Pass, his expression increasingly grave.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he naturally understood that this battle not only determined the fate of Qingyun State, but also the future pattern of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>If he could win this battle, then there would be no obstacles to his ambitions in the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, if he were to lose...</p><p></p><p>Then it would be the end of everything.</p><p></p><p>"Relay the order to all the troops, prepare for battle!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang commanded in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Currently, there were two hundred thousand troops stationed within the Tianxiong Pass, which was the concentrated might of the entire Qingyun State.</p><p></p><p>As the news spread, everyone's spirits were heavy with gravity.</p><p></p><p>In the vast Tianxiong Pass, there was a sense of an impending storm.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the Ling King's army was also advancing.</p><p></p><p>In the middle of the army, the Ling King rode his horse, accompanied by many powerful experts under his command, as well as Fu Zhao and other top cultivators from Taisuzu.</p><p></p><p>For this battle, Taisuzu not only had Fu Zhao coming, but also the majority of the powerful experts from other sects, including the Taisuzu Sect Master, Taixuan Shi.</p><p></p><p>After all, this battle determined whether Taisuzu could establish its dominance over the Nine Provinces, so even with Fu Zhao, a Penetrating Deity Realm expert, guarding the situation, Taixuan Shi still had to make the most thorough preparations.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After half a day, the Tianxiong Pass came into view in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of thousands of troops were silent, exuding a strong sense of oppression.</p><p></p><p>On the Tianxiong Pass, the defending army was also stationed.</p><p></p><p>"That is the Ling King!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked towards the army below, his gaze directly locking onto one person, as even from a great distance, a martial cultivator could still see clearly.</p><p></p><p>As Gu Yang's gaze fell upon him, the Ling King also looked up at him, and the two exchanged a gaze filled with a murderous aura.</p><p></p><p>"Attack the city!"</p><p></p><p>The Ling King waved his hand, issuing the order directly.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the army attacked the city.</p><p></p><p>The front-line infantry steadily advanced, while the archers in the back began raining down a barrage of arrows, densely covering the Tianxiong Pass.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Yang's expression also turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"Release the arrows!"</p><p></p><p>With his command, the defenders of the Tianxiong Pass also responded.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the exchange of arrows erupted on the battlefield, blooming into a shower of blood.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, arrows came flying towards Gu Yang, but he casually crushed them with his hands.</p><p></p><p>In no time, the enemy troops had reached the city walls.</p><p></p><p>Many martial cultivators had infiltrated the ranks, and they suddenly launched fierce attacks on the city gates. Although the gates were forged from refined iron, they could not withstand the attacks of the top-tier martial cultivators.</p><p></p><p>With a single powerful strike from the Grandmaster experts, they could shatter mountains and split the earth, and the city gates, no matter how sturdy, could hardly withstand the might of the Grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>So, in just a moment, the city gates were shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the city gates have been breached!"</p><p></p><p>A messenger rushed in to report.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression remained calm: "Proceed according to the plan!"</p><p></p><p>He had never intended to rely on the Tianxiong Pass to defend against the Ling King's army.</p><p></p><p>After all, in a world where some possessed extraordinary powers, warfare often became more brutal. The city gates might be sturdy, but they could not stop the attacks of the Grandmaster experts.</p><p></p><p>And with the infantry pressing forward, if there were Grandmasters mixed among them, no one would be able to detect them.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, once the Grandmasters approached the city, directly breaking through the gates was a normal occurrence.</p><p></p><p>All of this was within Gu Yang's expectations.</p><p></p><p>So, even though the city gates had been breached, Gu Yang was not worried at all.</p><p></p><p>As expected, the moment the gates were broken, a terrifying aura of spiritual energy erupted, and a substantial blade qi slashed through the air, instantly cleaving a Grandmaster expert who couldn't even react in time, splitting him in half. His flesh and blood scattered.</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhen rode out on his horse, his crescent moon blade sweeping across the enemy, as a Qi Blood Grandmaster leading the charge, a devastating blow to the ordinary soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, the Tiangang Army closely followed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Time Zhen led the way, commanding the 36,000 Tiangong Army like a sharp dagger, ruthlessly piercing into the enemy army and tearing apart the vanguard of the enemy infantry.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after.</p><p></p><p>The other generals were leading the main army to charge in close pursuit.</p><p></p><p>The two armies clashed head-on and were engaged in a fierce melee.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Time Zhen roared, his flesh and blood boiling. His Crescent Moon Blade slashed out, cleaving any soldiers it touched directly in half.</p><p></p><p>"Scoundrel, do not be so arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>From the Ling King's army, a general charged forward, his powerful true qi erupting and condensing into a terrifying blade qi that came crashing down on Time Zhen.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Time Zhen's expression was unafraid, his killing intent surging.</p><p></p><p>"Kill—"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the Crescent Moon Blade fell with the force of a mountain being split. The two powers collided, and although both were at the Grandmaster realm, the Qi and Blood Grandmaster ultimately prevailed.</p><p></p><p>The blade qi shattered, causing the other man's expression to change, hastily raising his blade to block. The powerful force shook him, making his arms tremble and his tiger's mouth crack.</p><p></p><p>Sustaining such injuries in a single exchange left the Xiantian Grandmaster greatly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>"Tiangong Army, follow me to kill!" Time Zhen roared, as a terrifying blood-killing aura rose from the Tiangong Army and merged into him.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Time Zhen's power greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>The Crescent Moon Blade fell again, the grim, blood-like blade qi tearing through the void like it was slicing the heavens and earth. The Xiantian Grandmaster's expression was one of fear, trying to block but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>"Rip!"</p><p></p><p>His physical body was cleaved in two, and the Xiantian Grandmaster instantly perished.</p><p></p><p>"Qi and Blood Grandmaster!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the army, the Taixuan Master witnessed Time Zhen condensing the blood-killing aura and directly slaying a Xiantian Grandmaster, his eyes suddenly emitting a cold glint.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, he stepped into the void, the power of a peak Huasheng realm expert erupting and rushing towards Time Zhen.</p><p></p><p>For a Taixuan Master of this level, the flesh and blood of ordinary people could not play a significant role, even if he slaughtered tens of thousands, it would not be as substantial as a single Qi and Blood Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>However, while there were some Grandmasters in the jianghu, Qi and Blood Grandmasters were as rare as phoenix feathers and qilin horns. Now, seeing a Qi and Blood Grandmaster in person, the Taixuan Master could not sit still.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Taixuan Master approaching, a terrifying pressure immediately assaulted Time Zhen, causing his expression to turn grave. He once again mobilized the power of the Tiangong Army, and the horrifying blood-killing aura in the void condensed into the illusory form of a peerless demonic deity.</p><p></p><p>Finally, this demonic deity illusion merged with Time Zhen.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the Crescent Moon Blade fell.</p><p></p><p>The earth-shattering blade qi sliced through the heavens and earth, as if splitting the nine firmaments in half. This terrifying strike collided with the Taixuan Master's attack, instantly unleashing devastation that shook the world.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!!"</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored blade qi shattered.</p><p>The demonic deity illusion dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Time Zhen only felt a powerful backlash force engulf him, causing his entire body's blood and qi to surge, and a sweet metallic taste to rise in his throat.</p><p></p><p>"Huasheng realm cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>His gaze towards the Taixuan Master was filled with gravity.</p><p></p><p>Time Zhen was well aware of the formidable power of the Tiangong Shensha Formation.</p><p></p><p>But now, in a single exchange, the formation had been completely broken by the Taixuan Master, revealing the true strength of such an expert, which was beyond Time Zhen's ability to contend with.</p><p></p><p>Yet, despite this, Time Zhen did not retreat.</p><p></p><p>"You are not bad, to be able to withstand my strike, but that is all." </p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Master's gaze held a hint of surprise, not expecting Time Zhen to be able to block his attack. He did not waste any more words, intending to simply destroy the opponent.</p><p></p><p>However, just as the Taixuan Master was about to make his move, a terrifying sword intent suddenly surged, and endless sword qi came crashing in, causing the former to feel a sense of alarm and hurriedly turn to block.</p><p></p><p>"Boom—"</p><p></p><p>The powers collided.</p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Master's body remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the newcomer, his gaze instantly turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Dao Cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"I have long heard of the Taixuan Sect Master's supreme cultivation, so I have come to experience it myself today."</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Cultivator approached with his sword drawn, his overwhelming true qi manifesting, allowing him to traverse the void.</p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Master sneered, "Do you truly think that just because you have broken through the Great Grandmaster realm, you have the qualifications to act recklessly before me?"</p><p></p><p>"Whether I have the qualifications or not, we'll know after a fight!"</p><p></p><p>As the Sword Dao Cultivator spoke, the iron sword on his back suddenly unsheathed. Gripping the hilt with his right hand, when the sword edge slashed out, it unleashed a terrifying sword qi like a shooting star, directly targeting the Taixuan Master's face.</p><p></p><p>The latter, seeing this, had his spiritual power surge. Stretching out his five fingers, he forcefully clenched, shattering the sword qi.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the Taixuan Master took a step forward, his figure instantly appearing behind the Sword Dao Cultivator, slamming down a palm strike.</p><p></p><p>However, the Sword Dao Cultivator seemed to have anticipated this, shifting his body, and the iron sword swept out horizontally.</p><p></p><p>The two were both top experts of the current era.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they clashed, they exchanged dozens of strikes...</p><p></p><p>At Tianhong Pass.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stood with his hands behind his back, his gaze calmly observing the battlefield below.</p><p></p><p>When he saw Time Zhen manipulating the blood-killing power, able to directly contend with the Taixuan Master, his expression showed a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Tiangong Shensha Formation?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was aware of the secret formation that Gu Yang had organized the Tiangong Army to practice.</p><p></p><p>But he had never truly witnessed the might of this formation.</p><p></p><p>Until now.</p><p></p><p>On the current battlefield, </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng finally got to see the fearsome power of the Tiangong Shensha Formation.</p><p></p><p>Time Zhen had just entered the Qi and Blood Grandmaster realm, and with the Tiangong Army's assistance, he was still only a slightly larger ant in the eyes of a Huasheng realm expert.</p><p></p><p>But now, he was able to withstand the Taixuan Master's strike, revealing the formation's strength.</p><p></p><p>"Father, do you think the Sword Cultivator can be the Taixuan Master's match?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression was grave.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Sword Dao Cultivator was a Great Grandmaster, his opponent was the Taixuan Sect Master, and Gu Yang could not help but be worried.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Sword Dao Cultivator had often guided his own cultivation, and could be considered a half-teacher.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "The Taixuan Master is a peak Huasheng realm expert, so his cultivation is naturally stronger than the Sword Dao Cultivator's. But in a battle between experts, it is not just a simple matter of cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Cultivator's strength is not as simple as you see.</p><p></p><p>Although the probability of him ultimately falling in a life-and-death battle is very high, for the Taixuan Master to truly slay him would not be an easy task!"</p><p></p><p>For the two to determine a victor, it would not be a short process, and for a life-and-death outcome, it would be even more difficult.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng looked back towards the Ling King's army.</p><p></p><p>There, a strange, icy aura permeated the area, far more terrifying than the evil entity from Blood Mountain before.</p><p></p><p>"Fu Zhao!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng knew that this aura must be from the Taixuan Sect's Supreme Elder.</p><p></p><p>"They say this person has newly broken through to the Divine Realm, but now it seems the rumors may not be that simple."</p><p></p><p>"Father, do you have confidence?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's words caused Gu Qingfeng's expression to change slightly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stood with his hands behind his back, his expression still calm. "Fu Zhao has slaughtered millions of lives in the Central Continent, causing the deaths of countless Grandmaster cultivators. His strength breakthrough is only natural.</p><p></p><p>But even if Fu Zhao has broken through, he won't be able to stir up any major waves."</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Qingfeng's words fell, the Ling King, looking at the battlefield carnage, also had an unpleasant expression.</p><p></p><p>In his view, he had led hundreds of thousands of troops here, and should have crushed the Guangyang army with an overwhelming advantage.</p><p></p><p>But now, looking at it...</p><p></p><p>Although the two sides were engaged in a brutal battle, his side had not gained any advantage.</p><p></p><p>If this continued, even if they won, it would be a pyrrhic victory for his side.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the Ling King looked at the nearby Fu Zhao and respectfully said, "The Guangyang army is resisting fiercely, please have the Supreme Elder take action to break their formation and slay the enemy!"</p><p></p><p>"Very well, I should stretch my limbs a bit." </p><p></p><p>Fu Zhao smiled slightly, the blood color in his eyes deepening.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he stepped into the void, directly entering the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, his aura erupted.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying evil entity illusion condensed from the void.</p><p></p><p>This overwhelming pressure caused countless soldiers to have their physical bodies explode, instantly perishing on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Insignificant insects, daring to block the path of my Taixuan Sect, seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Zhao looked towards the city wall, raising his hand and unleashing a palm strike, the terrifying power as if the heavens and earth were collapsing, causing Gu Yang's breathing to become difficult.</p><p></p><p>However, before the palm strike could truly land, Gu Qingfeng pointed a finger, and a blood-colored blade light sliced through the stars, directly cutting the hand of condensed spiritual power in half.</p><p></p><p>"Boom—"</p><p></p><p>The terrifying power's aftershocks dispersed.</p><p></p><p>Fu Zhao narrowed his eyes, looking towards the other person on the city wall.</p><p></p><p>"So you are Gu Qingfeng!"</p><p></p><p>Although the previous strike was just a casual action on his part, the fact that Gu Qingfeng could casually block it made Fu Zhao feel somewhat grave.</p><p></p><p>Just as the rumors had said, the other's strength had already broken through the limits of the Great Grandmaster realm, able to rival the ancient Martial Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Qingfeng also stepped into the void.</p><p></p><p>"Killing you, I believe there will be no one else who can block the Guangyang army's advance!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill me?" </p><p></p><p>Fu Zhao seemed to hear a joke, the corners of his mouth curling in disdain.</p><p></p><p>"Do you truly think that just because you blocked my strike, you have the qualifications to act recklessly before me?"</p><p></p><p>"Not even if the Martial Ancestors of the past were reborn, could they withstand being slain by me today!"</p><p></p><p>"After killing you, if I refine your qi and blood, perhaps I can even advance further—"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Fu Zhao's terrifying aura erupted, and an oppressive force from the void descended, causing Gu Qingfeng's body to sink slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Forbidden Area!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression slightly changed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Qingfeng not moving, Fu Zhao coldly sneered, "Within this Forbidden Area, I am the true deity. To die here, you should consider it the greatest honor of your life!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Fu Zhao unleashed a palm strike, in his eyes, Gu Qingfeng was now suppressed by the Forbidden Area's power and could not possibly be his match.</p><p></p><p>This strike was different from the previous one, it was Fu Zhao's true full-force attack.</p><p></p><p>Just then, an overwhelmingly powerful blade intent suddenly erupted, and the space shattered bit by bit, the so-called Forbidden Area's power being torn apart by the blade intent.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, but an even more terrifying power than the Forbidden Area spread out, pressing down on Fu Zhao in reverse. The full-force attack had not even truly touched Gu Qingfeng before being completely shattered by the endless blade qi.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 112</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The interior of the carriage was luxuriously decorated, and the space was also extremely spacious. Gu Qingfeng sat in the middle position, while Gu Peng sat at the lower end.</p><p></p><p>"What is the current situation of the Liuyun Manor?"</p><p></p><p>"After the Shenwu King Pei Jing knocked on the door of the Liuyun Manor, the main army marched in directly, and most of the Liuyun Manor has fallen under Pei Jing's control.</p><p></p><p>Only a few cities and towns are still stubbornly holding on, hoping to wait for reinforcements from the court.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, it seems that the court has no intention of supporting the Liuyun Manor--"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Now he has reached the peak of the Refining Impurity realm, with some streaks of white at his temples, which have now completely turned jet-black, without a trace of aging.</p><p></p><p>This is the benefit of reaching the peak of the Refining Impurity realm.</p><p></p><p>A lifespan of two hundred years.</p><p></p><p>It has allowed Gu Peng's physical condition to return to his youthful prime, the peak of the peak.</p><p></p><p>"The court does not intend to support the Liuyun Manor?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's brows furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng said, "I heard that there are some problems in the Central Plains region, and the court is now at the end of its strength. The three-thousand-year-old dynasty is on the verge of disintegration."</p><p></p><p>"If the Great Xuan Dynasty completely collapses, the situation in the world will only become more chaotic."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, when the warlords are fighting for supremacy, the Gu Family Manor may also follow the example of other ancient sects and families, supporting a certain force. If we can seize a chance, that would be the best!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng's eyes gleamed with excitement as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Any ancient sect or family that has been passed down for generations has its own opportunities. The so-called immortal sects and families have even supported many forces to ascend the throne.</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family Manor may not imitate those immortal sects and families, but if they can support a force to participate in this battle for the world, they can also obtain many benefits.</p><p></p><p>Even if they ultimately fail, it doesn't matter.</p><p></p><p>After all, only one person has sat on that position in thousands of years, and the rest are just cannon fodder.</p><p></p><p>But the forces behind these cannon fodder are all swimming in wealth.</p><p></p><p>"The world is deep, and the Gu Family Manor currently lacks a Patriarch to anchor it. Our strength is not as strong as those top-tier sects and families. Even if we have a Patriarch, this world is ultimately the domain of the Mages.</p><p></p><p>The warriors are weak, and even ordinary Patriarchs are not qualified, at least they need to be True Meaning Patriarchs or Great Patriarchs to have a chance!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's gaze was profound as he shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng said, "With the strength of the old Manor Master, breaking through to Patriarch or even Great Patriarch should not be a problem!"</p><p></p><p>He had absolute confidence in Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Gu Qingfeng was just a Blood Refining realm warrior, but now he had achieved the realm of Half-step Patriarch in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>No, his strength might even be more than just Half-step Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Peng himself, as a small Patriarch in the Refining Impurity realm, already felt immense pressure in front of Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>It shows that the strength of this old Manor Master is simply unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the fact that Gu Qingfeng could produce the Refining Impurity Pill, a treasure that can directly help someone break through the Refining Impurity realm, gives people a sense of the unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>But it is precisely because of this unfathomable depth that Gu Peng becomes even more loyal and awestruck.</p><p></p><p>Awe often comes from the unknown!</p><p></p><p>"How is the current situation of the Liuyun Manor's forces in the jianghu?"</p><p></p><p>"The four thousand-year-old sects and families of the Liuyun Manor, including the Liu Family, the Wang Family, and the Heavenly Sword Sect, have all pledged allegiance to the Shenwu King. Only the Benevolent Alliance is in a wavering position--"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The unsettled state.</p><p></p><p>But so far, Pei Jing has not shown any intention to attack the Righteous Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng said.</p><p></p><p>He had already investigated the news of the Liuyun Manor thoroughly, so he could answer these questions easily.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded: "The Righteous Alliance... a thousand-year power, I imagine its strength is not weak. In the current situation, only a force that can truly maintain neutrality can be considered powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Neutrality!</p><p></p><p>It requires strength as support.</p><p></p><p>Neutrality without strength is just cannon fodder on the fence.</p><p></p><p>Now that Pei Jing's great army has swept through the Liuyun Manor, many forces have submitted one after another, which can be described as a magnificent momentum. The fact that the Righteous Alliance can maintain neutrality in such a situation shows its strength.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's current trip does not have the intention of being an enemy of the Righteous Alliance, nor does he bother to provoke other sect forces.</p><p></p><p>His goal is very simple.</p><p></p><p>That is the Divine Fist Sect.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has never been a magnanimous person.</p><p></p><p>Since the people of the Divine Fist Sect dared to attack and almost kill Gu Yang, they are destined to pay the price for it.</p><p></p><p>As for whether such actions will displease Pei Jing or even provoke other powerful figures, Gu Qingfeng is not too concerned.</p><p></p><p>In this world.</p><p></p><p>It is ultimately a matter of strength.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's cultivation has now reached the Refining Impurity Realm, and he has also mastered the true meaning of the Sect Master and perfected the Refining Bone technique. The extent of his true strength is unknown even to himself.</p><p></p><p>Sect Master!</p><p></p><p>Or even stronger than ordinary Sect Masters!</p><p></p><p>But at least.</p><p></p><p>In the rivers and lakes of Taishan Prefecture, Gu Qingfeng believes that even if there are people stronger than him, the number will not be too many.</p><p></p><p>A small Divine Fist Sect, even if it is to be destroyed, may not necessarily cause much of a stir.</p><p></p><p>No one will offend a strength comparable to a Sect Master for the sake of a Divine Fist Sect.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>If the Gu Family Manor is not strong enough, that would be a different story.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>This trip to the Liuyun Manor, Gu Qingfeng did not bring too many people, only some outer sect disciples and the outer sect elder Gu Peng accompanied him.</p><p></p><p>Along the way.</p><p></p><p>The group finally witnessed the true appearance of the chaotic world.</p><p></p><p>Refugees everywhere!</p><p></p><p>Cannibalism!</p><p></p><p>Bare bones in the wilderness, no sound of chickens for miles! This is the true chaos.</p><p></p><p>For the upper class, it is just a power struggle, but for the common people, it is a true disaster.</p><p></p><p>Seeing these scenes, Gu Qingfeng's heart grew increasingly cold.</p><p></p><p>These people are the truest reflection of this world, the so-called prosperity is nothing but false, the weak can only struggle to survive at the bottom.</p><p></p><p>If he were still an ordinary person without any strength, his fate would not be better than these people.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore.</p><p></p><p>With the arrival of the chaotic world, the people are in distress, and there are also strange creatures emerging, indiscriminately slaughtering and devouring the civilians.</p><p></p><p>Even Gu Family Manor's group encountered attacks from refugee bandits and strange creatures along the way.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>These strange creatures are not strong.</p><p></p><p>Even without Gu Qingfeng's personal involvement, Gu Peng's Refining Impurity Realm strength alone is enough to easily eliminate the refugee bandits and various strange creatures.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

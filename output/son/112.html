        <h1>Chapter 112</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The interior of the carriage was luxuriously decorated, and the space was extremely spacious. Gu Qingfeng sat in the middle position, while Gu Peng sat at the lower end.</p><p></p><p>"What is the current situation of the Liuyun Manor?"</p><p></p><p>"After the Shenwu King Pei Jing knocked on the door of the Liuyun Manor, the main army marched in directly, and most of the Liuyun Manor has fallen under Pei Jing's control.</p><p></p><p>Only a few cities and towns are still stubbornly holding on, hoping to wait for reinforcements from the court.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, it seems that the court has no intention of supporting the Liuyun Manor--"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Now he has reached the peak of the Lianzu (Refine Impurities) realm, with some gray hair at his temples, which has now completely turned jet-black, without a trace of aging.</p><p></p><p>This is the benefit of reaching the Lianzu realm.</p><p></p><p>A lifespan of two hundred years.</p><p></p><p>It has allowed Gu Peng's physical condition to return to his youthful prime, at the pinnacle of his peak.</p><p></p><p>"The court does not plan to support the Liuyun Manor?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's brows furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng said, "I heard that there are some problems in the Central Plains region, and the court is now at the end of its strength. The three-thousand-year-old dynasty is on the verge of disintegration."</p><p></p><p>"If the Taixuan Dynasty completely collapses, the situation in the world will only deteriorate further."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, when the warlords scramble for power, the Gu Family Manor may also emulate other ancient sects and families, supporting a certain force. If we can seize even a sliver of opportunity, that would be the best!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng's eyes gleamed with excitement as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Any ancient sect or family that has been passed down for generations has its own opportunities. The so-called immortal sects and families have even supported many forces to ascend the throne.</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family Manor may not emulate those immortal sects and families, but if they can support a force to participate in this scramble for the world, they can also obtain many benefits from it.</p><p></p><p>Even if they ultimately fail, it doesn't matter.</p><p></p><p>After all, only one person has sat on that position in thousands of years, and the rest are just cannon fodder.</p><p></p><p>But the forces behind these cannon fodder are all swimming in wealth.</p><p></p><p>"The world is deep, and the Gu Family Manor currently lacks a true master to lead it. Our strength is not as strong as those top-tier sects and families. Even if we have a master, this world ultimately belongs to the Sorcerers.</p><p></p><p>The warriors are weak, and even ordinary masters are not qualified. At least they need to be True Meaning Masters or Great Masters to have a chance!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's gaze was deep, and he shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng said, "With the old Manor Lord's strength, breaking through to become a Master or even a Great Master should not be a problem!"</p><p></p><p>He had absolute confidence in Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Initially, Gu Qingfeng was only a Lianxue (Refine Blood) realm warrior, but now he has achieved the realm of Half-step Master in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>No, his strength may even be beyond just a Half-step Master.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Peng himself is now a small Master in the Lianzu realm, and he feels immense pressure in front of Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>This shows that the old Manor Lord's strength is truly unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Gu Qingfeng's ability to produce the Lianzu Dan, a treasure that can directly help someone break through the Lianzu realm, gives people a sense of the unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>But it is precisely this unfathomable nature that makes Gu Peng even more loyal and in awe.</p><p></p><p>Awe often comes from the unknown!</p><p></p><p>"How is the current situation of the Liuyun Manor's forces in the jianghu?"</p><p></p><p>"The four thousand-year-old sects and families of the Liuyun Manor, including the Liu Family, the Wang Family, and the Tian Sword Sect, have all pledged allegiance to the Shenwu King. Only the Renyi Alliance is in a wavering position."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The Unsettled State.</p><p></p><p>But so far, Pei Jing has not made any moves against the Righteous Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng said.</p><p></p><p>He had already thoroughly investigated the news from the Liuyun Mansion, so he could answer these questions easily.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded: "The Righteous Alliance... a thousand-year power, I imagine their strength is not weak. In the current situation, only a force that can truly maintain neutrality can be considered powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Neutrality!</p><p></p><p>It requires strength as support.</p><p></p><p>Neutrality without strength is just cannon fodder on the fence.</p><p></p><p>Now that Pei Jing's great army has swept through the Liuyun Mansion, many forces have submitted one after another, which can be described as a magnificent momentum. Yet the Righteous Alliance can still maintain neutrality in such a situation, which is a clear indication of their strength.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng on this trip did not have the intention of being an enemy of the Righteous Alliance, nor did he bother to provoke other sect forces.</p><p></p><p>His target was very simple.</p><p></p><p>That is the Divine Fist Sect.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has never been a magnanimous person.</p><p></p><p>Since the people of the Divine Fist Sect dared to attack and almost kill Gu Yang, they must pay the price for it.</p><p></p><p>As for whether such actions will displease Pei Jing or even provoke other powerful figures, Gu Qingfeng did not care too much.</p><p></p><p>In this world.</p><p></p><p>It is ultimately a matter of strength.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's cultivation has now reached the Refining Impurity Realm, and he has also mastered the true meaning of the Sect Master and perfected the Refining Bone technique. The extent of his true strength is something he is not even clear about himself.</p><p></p><p>Sect Master!</p><p></p><p>Or even stronger than the average Sect Master!</p><p></p><p>But at least.</p><p></p><p>In the rivers and lakes of Taishan Prefecture, Gu Qingfeng believes that even if there are people stronger than him, the number will not be too many.</p><p></p><p>A small Divine Fist Sect, even if it is to be destroyed, it is unlikely to cause much of a stir.</p><p></p><p>No one will offend a powerful figure comparable to a Sect Master just for the sake of the Divine Fist Sect.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>If the Gu Family Mansion is not strong enough, then it would be a different story.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On this trip to the Liuyun Mansion, Gu Qingfeng did not bring too many people, only some outer disciples and the outer hall master Gu Peng accompanied him.</p><p></p><p>Along the way.</p><p></p><p>The group finally truly witnessed the scene of the chaotic world.</p><p></p><p>Refugees everywhere! </p><p></p><p>Cannibalism!</p><p></p><p>Bones exposed in the wilderness, no sound of chickens for miles! This is the true chaos of the world.</p><p></p><p>For the upper class, it is just a power struggle and replacement, but for the common people, it is a true disaster.</p><p></p><p>Seeing these scenes, Gu Qingfeng's heart grew increasingly cold.</p><p></p><p>These people are the truest reflection of this world, the so-called prosperity is nothing but false, the weak can only struggle to survive at the bottom.</p><p></p><p>If he were still an ordinary person without any power, his fate would not be better than these people.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore.</p><p></p><p>With the arrival of the chaotic world, the people's livelihood is disrupted, and there are also bizarre creatures emerging, indiscriminately slaughtering and devouring the civilians.</p><p></p><p>Even on the journey of Gu Family Mansion's group, they not only encountered attacks from refugee bandits, but also encountered these bizarre creatures several times.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>These bizarre creatures are not strong in strength.</p><p></p><p>Even without Gu Qingfeng personally taking action, Gu Peng's Refining Impurity Realm cultivation alone is enough to slaughter them indiscriminately, whether they are refugee bandits or various bizarre creatures, they are easily subdued by him.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

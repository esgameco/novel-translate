        <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A piece of news shook the entire Baishi Path.</p><p></p><p>The patriarch of the Chu family, the Thunderous Sword Chu Tianxiong, was killed with a single punch!</p><p></p><p>The boss of the Iron Bone Gang, the Invincible Divine Fist Luo Yu, was killed on the spot by two palms.</p><p></p><p>As soon as this news spread,</p><p></p><p>it caused a massive uproar throughout the entire Baishi Path.</p><p></p><p>As for Chu Tianxiong, the Thunderous Sword, although his opponent was already renowned, he was not considered one of the top experts of the Baishi Path.</p><p></p><p>But Luo Yu was different.</p><p></p><p>Through his own efforts, he had established the Iron Bone Gang, and in just a few decades, the Iron Bone Gang had become one of the top powers in the Baishi Path, with only a handful of top families like the Qin family able to contend with them.</p><p></p><p>Especially in recent years, the Iron Bone Gang's influence had been growing stronger and stronger, to the point where even the Qin family had been suppressed and struggled to breathe.</p><p></p><p>For such powerful figures to be directly slain, how could it not shock the various factions of the jianghu?</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>the name of the patriarch of the Gu family, Gu Qingfeng, also resounded throughout the Baishi Path.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng's reputation in the Baishi Path was already renowned before, it was not as awe-inspiring as it is now.</p><p></p><p>Slaying Luo Yu,</p><p></p><p>the three words "Gu Qingfeng" are now equated with the number one expert of the Baishi Path.</p><p></p><p>Although the Qin family's ancestor and the Cloud Dragon Sect's Yunchangkong were both Refinement of Blood Realm experts, in the eyes of others, their strength was at most on par with Luo Yu.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength,</p><p></p><p>they could not possibly be Gu Qingfeng's match.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>in the backyard of the Qin family,</p><p></p><p>the current Qin family patriarch, Qin Hongtang, stood respectfully in front of a grass hut and said, "Reporting to the ancestor, Luo Yu is dead!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words fell, an old man walked out of the grass hut.</p><p></p><p>He had gray hair and wrinkles on his face, but his eyes were sharp and keen, unlike the usual clouded eyes of an old man.</p><p></p><p>This person,</p><p></p><p>was the Qin family ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Luo Yu is dead, who killed him?" the Qin family ancestor asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>He was clear about Luo Yu's strength, and if he were in his prime, subduing him would not be a problem. But now, with his aging body and declining vital energy, he might not necessarily be Luo Yu's match in a life-and-death battle.</p><p></p><p>Qin Hongtang said, "The one who slew Luo Yu is the Gu family patriarch, Gu Qingfeng. He led the Gu family guards to the Chu family, and at the Chu family's gate, he killed Chu Tianxiong with a single punch.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Luo Yu came with his people and got into a conflict with him.</p><p></p><p>According to the news, Gu Qingfeng only used two moves to slay Luo Yu!"</p><p></p><p>As he said this, a trace of fear could be seen in Qin Hongtang's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Slaying Luo Yu with just two moves, it was understandable for him to be shocked.</p><p></p><p>Even the Qin family ancestor, upon hearing this, had a change in his expression, his old face filled with solemnity.</p><p></p><p>"Slaying Luo Yu with just two moves, this person's strength must have reached the Refinement of Bone Realm, if not already at the threshold of it!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure, I only know that he has cultivated the Qi and Blood Tempest, and he is even taller than five or six zhang—"</p><p></p><p>"Five or six zhang of Qi and Blood Tempest!!"</p><p></p><p>The Qin family ancestor was shocked again.</p><p></p><p>The Qi and Blood Tempest was difficult to cultivate, and even in his prime, he only had a two-zhang Qi and Blood Tempest, but even that was enough to dominate the Baishi Path with few rivals.</p><p></p><p>But now, with his vital energy declining, the Qi and Blood Tempest had become a thing of the past.</p><p></p><p>However, even so,</p><p></p><p>the Qin family ancestor understood the concept of a five or six-zhang Qi and Blood Tempest.</p><p></p><p>As the Qin family ancestor was deep in thought, Qin Hongtang said, "A few years ago, the mysterious expert who slew several of our Qin family's Refinement of Blood elders outside White Stone City, that mysterious expert is very likely Gu Qingfeng."</p><p></p><p>"It's highly possible—"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The patriarch of the Qin family also nodded.</p><p></p><p>Achieving this was not a problem at all for Gu Qingfeng's abilities.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>The patriarch of the Qin family again warned, "You should keep this matter to yourself and treat it as if nothing has happened. The current strength of the Qin family is not enough to provoke a half-step Liangu expert.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, prepare a congratulatory gift to visit the Gu family and express the attitude of our Qin family!"</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Elder!" </p><p></p><p>Qin Hongtang respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>A weakest expert at the half-step Liangu realm is indeed not someone the Qin family can provoke right now, not even when the Qin family was at its peak in the past did they have such a powerful expert guarding them.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>Showing goodwill is a must.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise,</p><p></p><p>The Iron Bone Gang of today may become the Qin family of tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>As for the Qin family, who used to be the hegemon-level force of the Baishi Dao, now bowing their heads to the newly emerging Gu family, Qin Hongtang didn't mind it at all.</p><p></p><p>What is face worth anyway?</p><p></p><p>In the jianghu, it is strength that speaks.</p><p></p><p>If your fist is big, then you have face.</p><p></p><p>If your fist is not big enough, then you can only bow your head and be humble.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore... When Luo Yu was about to die, he once said that he was a man of the Shenwu King. Elder, how do you think about this matter?"</p><p></p><p>At the end, Qin Hongtang said another sentence.</p><p></p><p>"The Shenwu King!"</p><p></p><p>The patriarch of the Qin family's expression changed, then became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"The Shenwu King started his uprising from Nanyang Prefecture, and in just over a decade, he has swept through Nanyang, Chiang, and Danyang three prefectures. If the Iron Bone Gang is indeed related to that person, it means the Shenwu King has already set his sights on Guangyang Prefecture, and may even be eyeing the entire Taishan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>This matter can be both big and small. If a war breaks out, we world-renowned martial artists may find it difficult to remain unscathed!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the possibility of the rebel army entering Guangyang Prefecture and the war affecting the entire Baishi Dao, the patriarch of the Qin family felt restless.</p><p></p><p>With the Qin family's current foundation, if they were to be affected by the war, they might be wiped out in an instant.</p><p></p><p>But if they were to leave the Baishi Dao, it would be like abandoning the business they had built up over the years.</p><p></p><p>At that time,</p><p></p><p>Even if the Qin family were to leave the Baishi Dao and go to other places, they would still find it difficult to settle down.</p><p></p><p>After all -</p><p></p><p>The world is in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>The turmoil is not limited to just one Qingyun State, but the Nine States and Thirty-Six Prefectures of the world, with the flames of war gradually spreading.</p><p></p><p>Qin Hongtang said, "The Shenwu King has been able to gain such momentum in just a few years, perhaps he may one day have the qualifications to ascend the great throne.</p><p></p><p>I think our Qin family should directly ally with the Shenwu King. If the Shenwu King succeeds in the future, our Qin family will have contributed to his cause, and maybe we can even take a step up to the heavens!"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Qin Hongtang's face had a hint of excitement.</p><p></p><p>The patriarch of the Qin family snorted coldly and directly poured a bucket of cold water on him: "In times of chaos and contention, countless people perish. If the Qin family were to get involved in such a war, we would be torn to shreds by the torrents of chaos in an instant.</p><p></p><p>And do you really think that the Taixuan Dynasty, which has ruled the world for hundreds of years, has left behind no foundation? Although the world seems to be in chaos, the Taixuan Dynasty is not as simple as it appears.</p><p></p><p>The Shenwu King may seem impressive, but the power he wields is not necessarily superior to the Taixuan Dynasty, let alone other rebel armies. </p><p></p><p>Hastily choosing a side before the situation becomes clear is completely courting destruction. This matter concerns the future of the Qin family, do not be careless!"</p><p></p><p>These words suddenly awakened Qin Hongtang, and his back was already soaked in sweat.</p><p></p><p>"Elder's teachings are right!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

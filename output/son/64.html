        <h1>Chapter 64</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stood as firm as a boulder, unmoving.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly,</p><p></p><p>The morning sun rose in the east.</p><p></p><p>A beam of dawn light pierced through the darkness of the sky.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng immediately adjusted his breathing and meditated on the true essence of the sun. In his breath, a scorching force seemed to surge into his body, flowing through his meridians and flesh. A faint burning sensation appeared, but it soon dissipated.</p><p></p><p>After a moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's body moved, and he exhaled a breath.</p><p></p><p>"Whew!"</p><p></p><p>The exhalation was like thunder.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a white glow had broken through the air.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at his own attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>On it, the Qingyang Sutra had remarkably reached the introductory level.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Qingyang Sutra (First Level of Initiation)...</p><p></p><p>"The Qingyang Sutra is truly the supreme martial art of the Qingyang Sect, such a unique cultivation method is profoundly extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng withdrew his gaze from the attribute panel and felt the changes within himself. A look of amazement appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>The Qingyang Sutra is different from other martial arts. This martial art emphasizes meditating on the true essence of the sun and refining the first ray of solar energy from the morning sun, then using it to temper one's qi, blood, and physique.</p><p></p><p>This cultivation method can imbue one's qi and blood with the extremely yang and unyielding essence of the sun, granting the cultivator an increase in strength.</p><p></p><p>This is why,</p><p></p><p>Once the Qingyang Sutra is mastered, one can rival those at the half-step Xiu Sui realm.</p><p></p><p>It must be said,</p><p></p><p>This martial art is indeed extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>The difficulty of cultivating the Qingyang Sutra is also extremely high.</p><p></p><p>The first step of meditating on the true essence of the sun and drawing the hidden solar energy into the body is enough to block ninety-nine percent of martial artists.</p><p></p><p>This aspect requires great insight.</p><p></p><p>In the past, it would not have been easy for Gu Qingfeng to reach the introductory level.</p><p></p><p>But he is a high-level Zhan Zang realm cultivator, and no matter how profound the Qingyang Sutra is, it is still only a supreme-grade martial art.</p><p></p><p>As such,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was able to reach the introductory level in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>The Qingyang Sutra is divided into nine levels.</p><p></p><p>The first level involves the Lian Pi realm, the second to fifth levels involve the Lian Xue realm, and the sixth to ninth levels are the cultivation methods of the Lian Gu realm.</p><p></p><p>Now,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has reached the first level of initiation.</p><p></p><p>Although this step can initially draw solar energy into the body, the attracted energy is still too weak to bring about any significant changes.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Qingfeng is not in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation is not something that can be achieved overnight.</p><p></p><p>As long as he gives himself time, the Qingyang Sutra will eventually reach its perfection.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three days later,</p><p></p><p>Shi Kai came to the door again.</p><p></p><p>He handed a dark metal box to Gu Qingfeng and said in a deep voice, "The Zhu Jian Gate has not disappointed, and has forged the divine weapon that the Gu Family Lord requires."</p><p></p><p>"Good!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes lit up, and he immediately opened the box. Inside, a long sword with a black scabbard was resting.</p><p></p><p>Immediately,</p><p></p><p>He grasped the hilt and drew the sword out of the scabbard.</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh!"</p><p></p><p>The long sword emerged, its cold light shimmering like autumn water. Although the blade had a slightly yellowish hue, it gave off an undeniable sharpness.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng gently caressed the blade, feeling its keenness. The skin that could withstand the attacks of Xiu Sui realm cultivators was naturally no match for this blade.</p><p></p><p>But even so, Gu Qingfeng could sense the extraordinary nature of this sword.</p><p></p><p>"This sword has been infused with Blood-Refining Stone, which can contain the cultivator's qi and blood. The Gu Family Lord can try infusing his own qi and blood into the blade," Shi Kai reminded.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng tried to activate the power of his own blood and qi, and the surging blood qi was rushing like a mighty river. This terrifying might caused Stone Open's face to turn pale, and his whole body was trembling involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>Yes, trembling.</p><p></p><p>In Stone Open's eyes, the current Gu Qingfeng was like a ferocious beast from the primordial era, and that majestic blood qi power was something a normal person could not possess.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng paid no attention to Stone Open's shock, as all his focus was now on the long saber.</p><p></p><p>The moment the blood qi power merged into the saber, the long saber suddenly started to vibrate, and the hidden power within seemed to have been fully unleashed.</p><p></p><p>This time, when Gu Qingfeng used the blade to cut across his palm, the skin that could previously defend against a Washing Marrow Realm cultivator was instantly torn apart.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the damaged skin recovered, leaving only a faint scar.</p><p></p><p>"Good saber!" Gu Qingfeng shouted loudly, fully satisfied with this saber.</p><p></p><p>His defensive power was now terrifying, and this saber could hurt him, which meant it could also harm other Refining Impurity Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, this could also enhance Gu Qingfeng's own strength.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Gu Qingfeng just wanted the Forging Sword Gate to forge a reliable weapon for him to unleash the power of the Seven Killing Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, the Forging Sword Gate had given him a pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying blood qi power receded, and while Stone Open's forehead was sweating, he couldn't help but feel a sense of pride upon hearing Gu Qingfeng's words.</p><p></p><p>"The Forging Sword Gate has been focusing on forging weapons for generations. Many of the so-called divine weapons in the jianghu are actually just false divine weapons, not true divine weapons."</p><p></p><p>"But the weapon in the hands of the Gu Family Master is different. It is a true divine weapon!"</p><p></p><p>"A true divine weapon is one that can change according to the cultivator's strength. The stronger the wielder, the greater the power the divine weapon can unleash!"</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, true divine weapons are difficult to forge successfully. In the history of the Forging Sword Gate, there have been only a few true divine weapons forged."</p><p></p><p>"This time, we were able to succeed thanks to the materials provided by the Gu Family Master. Otherwise, even forging a divine weapon would have been difficult!"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Stone Open looked at the long saber with envy.</p><p></p><p>True divine weapons, who wouldn't covet them?</p><p></p><p>When the divine weapon was forged, Stone Open even had the impulse to seize it for himself, but thinking about the Gu Family, he forcibly suppressed this idea.</p><p></p><p>Even though the divine weapon was excellent, one must have the means to wield it.</p><p></p><p>To offend the Gu Family just for a divine weapon, if the matter was exposed, the entire Forging Sword Gate would be uprooted.</p><p></p><p>Of this, Stone Open had no doubt.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Gu Family Master in front of him was never a merciful person, and the amount of blood on his hands was horrifying. Even if the Forging Sword Gate had ten times the courage, Stone Open would not dare to take this divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, with the divine weapon forged, it could make the Gu Family satisfied, which would only bring benefits and no harm to the Forging Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Qingfeng sheathed the saber and placed it in the box, then turned his gaze to Stone Open.</p><p></p><p>"Master Stone, this time you have successfully forged a divine weapon, and Gu is very satisfied. The previous reward of ten thousand taels of silver now seems a bit insufficient."</p><p></p><p>"If there is anything you need, Master Stone can just speak up. As long as it's not too much, Gu will agree to it!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Stone Open immediately understood that he had bet correctly.</p><p></p><p>So, after a brief consideration, he stated his request.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

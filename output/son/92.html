        <h1>Chapter 92</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was a child of about seven or eight years old standing there timidly, his gaze filled with awe as he looked at Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was also looking at the child in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Unlike before when he was sallow and thin, after a month of improved diet and martial arts training, the other party's qi and blood had improved significantly.</p><p></p><p>"His qi and blood are as strong as an ox!"</p><p></p><p>"This is indeed a sign of entering the martial dao!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Just by observing the other party's qi and blood, he could tell whether he had truly entered the ranks of martial artists.</p><p></p><p>After all, </p><p></p><p>the qi and blood of martial artists are robust.</p><p></p><p>Even at the initial stage of Refining Skin realm, their physical strength would be far beyond that of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>"What is your name?"</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the lord, my name is Dog Cub -"</p><p></p><p>The child answered nervously, his speech a bit stuttered.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng asked, "Where is your ancestral home, and do you have any other family members?"</p><p></p><p>"I have forgotten my ancestral home, and I only have my parents, but they passed away due to famine in recent years, so now I am the only one left."</p><p></p><p>This time, Dog Cub answered much more fluently.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Since it is so, from today onwards you shall be named Gu Quan and become a formal inner court disciple. This is Inner Court Master Gu Yang, and he will guide you in your cultivation from now on."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Gu Qingfeng pointed to Gu Yang beside him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Quan, formerly known as Dog Cub, was stunned for a moment, then became overjoyed, bowing his head in gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Lord!"</p><p>"Greetings, Master!"</p><p></p><p>During the time he had spent in the Gu Family Manor, Gu Quan had heard about the existence of the Inner Court. It was a higher level than the Outer Court disciples, and only the direct descendants of the Gu family and those granted the Gu surname could join the Inner Court.</p><p></p><p>Gu Quan had never really thought about the Inner Court before. In his view, his true goal was to reach the Refining Skin realm within a year and become a formal Outer Court disciple, so that he would no longer have to live a life of eating one meal and going hungry for three days.</p><p></p><p>But what Gu Quan didn't expect was that not only did he become an official disciple of the Gu Family Manor, but he was also directly admitted into the Inner Court, granted the Gu surname. How could his heart not be excited?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Gu Quan took his leave.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang took him to familiarize him with the environment of the Inner Court.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, </p><p></p><p>this was the first disciple of the Inner Court.</p><p></p><p>As the true core of the Gu Family Manor, Gu Qingfeng naturally would not allow just anyone to join the Inner Court. They had to either be a direct descendant of the Gu family, or someone truly loyal to the Gu family and possessing sufficient talent.</p><p></p><p>Only these two types of people could become Inner Court disciples.</p><p></p><p>Gu Quan was young and an orphan, so as long as the Gu Family Manor cultivated him carefully, they could easily plant the seeds of loyalty in his heart from a young age. His loyalty would then naturally not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>As for talent,</p><p></p><p>that didn't need much explanation.</p><p></p><p>He could enter the initial stage of Refining Skin realm in just one month.</p><p></p><p>Such talent,</p><p></p><p>was unmatched by ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Recalling that Gu Qingfeng himself had taken several years to barely break through the initial stage of Refining Skin, the gap between them was clearly enormous.</p><p></p><p>Normally, </p><p></p><p>someone who could break through the initial stage of Refining Skin within a year could be roughly called a genius. They would have no problem advancing to Refining Blood, and even have a chance at Refining Bone.</p><p></p><p>If they could break through in half a year, then Refining Bone would be a done deal.</p><p></p><p>As for those who could do it in three months, they would have the hope of becoming a minor sect master in the future.</p><p></p><p>But someone who could enter the realm in just one month, that would be the seedling of a true master.</p><p></p><p>Not bad.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With Gu Quan's talent, if he doesn't die, he may even have a chance to break through to the Sect Master realm one day.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>The probability of breaking through to the Sect Master realm is very low, but there is still a chance.</p><p></p><p>There are many martial artists in the world, but how many can truly reach the Sect Master realm?</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng learned of Gu Quan's talent, he was also slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that among the thousand orphans, there would be such a top-tier genius.</p><p></p><p>Even if the remaining 999 people were all trash, this wave of the Gu Family Manor would not be a loss at all.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>In the residence of the inner disciples, Gu Yang looked at the person in front of him and then handed over a secret manual.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Gu Family Fist, I believe you have practiced it when you were in the outer court, but the Gu Family Fist that the named disciples practice is only a part of it. Now I'm giving you the complete mid-grade martial art.</p><p></p><p>This martial art is enough to lay a solid foundation for you and allow you to advance to the Refine Blood realm.</p><p></p><p>However, this martial art can only be practiced by you alone. If you casually spread it outside, and it is discovered by the manor, it will be an unforgivable capital offense!"</p><p></p><p>"I understand, subordinate!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Quan's expression changed, and he hurriedly bowed his head and said.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang nodded: "Mm, cultivate well, with your talent, you will have a place in the inner court in the future, don't let the lord's emphasis on you go to waste."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Quan solemnly nodded, taking the Gu Family Fist manual with his tender hands.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Yang gave him a few more reminders, telling Gu Quan that if he had any questions, he could come and ask him. Then he turned and left.</p><p></p><p>There are people in the inner court.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was also somewhat delighted.</p><p></p><p>After all, with this, he would not be an empty shell as the inner court hall master.</p><p></p><p>And in the inner disciple's residence, Gu Quan was also inspecting the surrounding environment. Unlike the outer court named disciples, where four or five people shared a room, the formal inner court disciples each had their own room, and the rooms were clean and tidy, and much more spacious.</p><p></p><p>This change made Gu Quan feel increasingly grateful.</p><p></p><p>In the following months, Gu Qingfeng was silently cultivating, but unfortunately, among the many named disciples in the outer court, there was no other top-tier genius like Gu Quan.</p><p></p><p>For this.</p><p></p><p>He was at peace in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, top-tier geniuses are rare, and for one to appear among a thousand people is already extremely surprising. To have another one appear would be virtually impossible.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Although there was no top-tier genius who entered the martial dao in one month, there were four upper-tier geniuses who broke through the martial dao in three months.</p><p></p><p>These few people, their backgrounds were similar to Gu Quan's.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng bestowed the Gu surname on them and brought them all into the inner court.</p><p></p><p>As for the inner court, Gu Qingfeng had no intention of just filling it up. At least they must have the potential to break through to the Small Sect Master realm before they could be admitted to the inner court.</p><p></p><p>From the very beginning.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had set the Gu Family Manor as a benchmark for the top forces. Although the Gu Family Manor currently appears weak, it is only because the time since its establishment is too short, and there is a gap in heritage compared to those major forces.</p><p></p><p>If given decades or even hundreds of years to grow, the Gu Family Manor would not be inferior to anyone.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng naturally would not lower the requirements for the inner court.</p><p></p><p>Later on, for those disciples who broke through the Refine Skin realm in half a year or a year, Gu Qingfeng uniformly made them formal outer court disciples. Whether they could enter the inner court would depend on further assessment in the future.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

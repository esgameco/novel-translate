        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Luo Yu suddenly dismissed the attendants and all the singing girls around him left the room. The other unrelated people also followed them out.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Tianxiong's expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"According to the news, the Great Army of the Shenwu King has already occupied most of the Danyang Prefecture. At most within a year, the Great Army will conquer the entire Danyang Prefecture. </p><p></p><p>At that time, the Great Army of the Shenwu King will certainly march into the Taishan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Now the Taixuan Dynasty is nearing its end, and the Shenwu King has amassed three prefectures in just a few years. He has a high chance of contending for the Heavenly Throne in the future.</p><p></p><p>As long as we can first seize the Baishi Road, when the Great Army of the Shenwu King arrives, we can coordinate with the army to capture Guangyang Prefecture. When the Shenwu King ascends the supreme throne, you and I will be meritorious subjects following the dragon!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Yu's expression was grave, and his words caused Chu Tianxiong's face to change slightly, but he soon smiled and said, "It is an honor for the Chu family to serve the Shenwu King. Whatever needs to be done next, the old man will not hesitate!"</p><p></p><p>"The next step is simple - while dealing with the Qin family, we will gradually devour the other forces on the Baishi Road. When the Great Army of the Shenwu King arrives, I only need the Iron Bone Gang to be the sole voice of the Baishi Road."</p><p></p><p>"Then what about the Tianyun Sect--"</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry about the Tianyun Sect, Yun Changkong is already serving the Shenwu King like me."</p><p></p><p>Luo Yu smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Tianxiong also felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Chu Tianxiong said, "During this time, my Chu family has also been gradually targeting the Gu family, but the Gu family seems to have no reaction at all. Facing the constant pressure from my Chu family, the Gu family has not shown any response.</p><p></p><p>Is there a problem here?"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning the Gu family, there was a hint of apprehension in Chu Tianxiong's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He was not afraid of the Gu family's resistance, but rather that the Gu family would remain as silent as they are now.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "A biting dog does not bark."</p><p></p><p>The more the Gu family remained silent, the more uneasy Chu Tianxiong felt.</p><p></p><p>Especially since the Gu family patriarch's strength was unfathomable. In Chu Tianxiong's judgment, the other party was likely a mid-stage or even late-stage Blood Refining cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Luo Yu's expression was indifferent: "You don't need to worry about the Gu family problem. You just need to gradually devour the Gu family. If Gu Qingfeng doesn't take action, then so be it. But if he dares to take action, I, the Gang Master, will deal with him.</p><p></p><p>Any who dare to resist the Shenwu King will not have a good end!"</p><p></p><p>Regarding the Gu family, Luo Yu never took them seriously.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when he sent people to recruit the Gu family, they were politely rejected. In Luo Yu's mind, the Gu family's fate had already been sealed.</p><p></p><p>Letting the Chu family secretly devour the Gu family was because the Iron Bone Gang was currently fully focused on dealing with the Qin family and had no time to spare.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Iron Bone Gang could not openly attack the Gu family right now. After all, there were still many neutral forces in the Baishi Road, and if the Iron Bone Gang publicly attacked the Gu family, it might cause the other neutral forces to feel threatened and side with the Qin family.</p><p></p><p>This situation was not what Luo Yu wanted to see.</p><p></p><p>Letting the Chu family devour the Gu family was because the Iron Bone Gang had suffered heavy losses in its fight against the Qin family over the years, and it needed to plunder resources from other directions to replenish its own losses.</p><p></p><p>Once the Qin family problem was truly resolved, the Iron Bone Gang would then turn its attention to dealing with these other forces, which would be much easier then.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Tianxiong also felt relieved. With the Iron Bone Gang backing him up, the Gu family's problem was no longer an issue, even if their patriarch was formidable.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even if his strength was formidable, he could not possibly be a match for Luo Yu.</p><p></p><p>After all, the person before him had been cultivating the Blood Refinement Realm for many years, with unfathomable inner strength. Among the entire White Stone Dao, only the one from the Qin family could contend with him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving the orders from the Iron Bone Gang, the Chu family intensified their efforts to secretly devour the Gu family's business.</p><p></p><p>However, the Chu family had never truly made a direct move against the Gu family from the beginning to the end. They only instigated and cultivated other people to target the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>In this way, even if the Gu family took any action, they could not directly confront the Chu family.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Chu Tianxiong secretly hoped that the Gu family would lose their patience and openly attack the Chu family. Then, the Chu family would have sufficient reason to join forces with the Iron Bone Gang and directly eliminate the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>A family clan with a Blood Refinement expert at its core must be in possession of abundant resources. If the Gu family could be destroyed, even if the Iron Bone Gang took the lion's share, the Chu family would still benefit greatly.</p><p></p><p>However, to Chu Tianxiong's disappointment, no matter how the Chu family secretly pressured them, the Gu family remained indifferent and ignored the loss of their business assets.</p><p></p><p>This feeling made Chu Tianxiong feel like he was punching cotton.</p><p></p><p>The problem was that since the Gu family did not respond, the Chu family could not make a direct move against them either.</p><p></p><p>After all, some things are different when brought out into the open compared to behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>In the current situation of the White Stone Dao, the Iron Bone Gang would not allow the Chu family to make a direct move against the Gu family openly.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Gu Qingfeng had Meng Peng report the external situation and the problems the Gu family currently faced every day, but he silently kept them in his heart without any further action.</p><p></p><p>However, in his heart, he had already decided to kill the Chu family.</p><p></p><p>It was just that the time was not right, and Gu Qingfeng was restraining himself.</p><p></p><p>In the past month, Gu Qingfeng had been cultivating the Scorching Sun Divine Palm, and the difficulty of the fourth layer was even higher. Even after a month, he was still stuck at the initial stage of the fourth layer.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Gu Qingfeng was also fully mobilizing the Gu family's resources to support Gu Yang's breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>On this day, while Gu Qingfeng was practicing, the information panel that had been quiet for a long time refreshed with new information.</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has broken through to the Refined Skin Realm Perfection!"</p><p>"Reward: 10 Upgrade Points!"</p><p>"Reward: 100 Blood Refinement Pills!"</p><p>"Reward: Mid-Grade Martial Art 'Heaven Thunder Sword Technique'!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Finally, it's here!" Gu Qingfeng looked at the text on the information panel, and a rare smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>After years of waiting, Gu Yang had finally broken through to the Refined Skin Realm Perfection.</p><p></p><p>This breakthrough of Gu Yang's brought an unprecedented and bountiful reward.</p><p></p><p>Ten upgrade points, one hundred Blood Refinement Pills, and a mid-grade martial art called the Heaven Thunder Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Gu Qingfeng immediately used the upgrade points to further advance the Scorching Sun Divine Palm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Consumed 1 Upgrade Point!"</p><p>"Scorching Sun Divine Palm broke through to the Fifth Layer Perfection!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Consumed 2 Upgrade Points!"</p><p>"Scorching Sun Divine Palm broke through to the Sixth Layer Perfection!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Breakthrough..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Consumed 2 Upgrade Points!"</p><p>"Scorching Sun Divine Palm broke through to the Ninth Layer Perfection!"</p><p></p><p>In a short time, Gu Qingfeng had directly advanced the Scorching Sun Divine Palm from the initial stage of the Fourth Layer all the way to the Ninth Layer Perfection.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 86</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The audacious Gu family, how dare they kill our Crimson Flame Sect's powerful cultivator!" </p><p></p><p>"This time, we must completely destroy the Gu family, slaughter all of them without leaving a single chicken or dog!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill, the Gu family must not be spared—"</p><p></p><p>In the sect's main hall, the elders of the Crimson Flame Sect were filled with righteous indignation, their voices brimming with fury.</p><p></p><p>The death of Wen Jiao.</p><p></p><p>It was a complete and utter slap in the face of the entire Crimson Flame Sect.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in this situation, many people wished to directly annihilate the Gu family in order to wash away the humiliation of the Crimson Flame Sect.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>Elder Leiyu spoke in a deep voice: "Sect Master, Wen Jiao had refined the first realm of impurity and evil within his body in the past, and now after hundreds of years of accumulation, his strength is not weak.</p><p></p><p>Even an ordinary sect master might not necessarily be Wen Jiao's match.</p><p></p><p>Now the outside world is rumoring that Wen Jiao was killed with a single stroke, if the rumors are true, this Gu Qingfeng's strength is likely not to be underestimated."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore—"</p><p></p><p>"In my opinion, it would be better to first bring Wen Jiao's body back, and then make plans!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken,</p><p></p><p>the voices in the hall suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Soon, there were voices refuting it.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Gu's words are mistaken, if the one who died this time was one of Leiyu Peak's people, would Elder Gu be as calm as he is now?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Ren's expression was indignant, and the fury in his eyes was unconcealed.</p><p></p><p>"Now the one who died is our Crimson Flame Peak's Peak Master, not only did Gu Qingfeng kill Peak Master Wen, but he also hung Wen Peak Master's body on that White Stone City, completely trampling on the face of our Crimson Flame Sect.</p><p></p><p>Both in reason and emotion, the Gu family's residence cannot be spared.</p><p></p><p>A small cultivator family, with a shallow foundation, even if Gu Qingfeng's strength is strong, how could he be a match for our Crimson Flame Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this,</p><p></p><p>Yan Ren immediately bowed to the Crimson Flame Sect Master Ouyang Lie in the seat of honor, his voice full of grief.</p><p></p><p>"Please, Sect Master, avenge Peak Master Wen!"</p><p></p><p>"Please, Sect Master, avenge Peak Master Wen—"</p><p></p><p>The remaining elders of the Crimson Flame Peak also spoke in unison.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Lie raised his hand, and the hall immediately fell silent, then the Crimson Flame Sect Master slowly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Of course Wen Peak Master's revenge must be avenged, but the most urgent task right now is to first bring Wen Peak Master's body back."</p><p></p><p>"Why don't we put pressure on the government to have them send Wen Peak Master's body back to us?" </p><p></p><p>An elder proposed.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Lie's expression was indifferent: "Although the court now seems weak, its accumulated strength over the years is not to be underestimated. At this critical juncture, we have no need to tear off our faces with the court.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the local government of White Stone City will not offend the Gu family for the sake of our Crimson Flame Sect."</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Lie was well aware of the government's intentions.</p><p></p><p>Although the court is now weak, it is not something the Crimson Flame Sect can easily offend.</p><p></p><p>Acting without justification.</p><p></p><p>If they rashly put pressure on the government, it will only end up damaging the reputation of the Crimson Flame Sect.</p><p></p><p>Saying this,</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Lie looked at the Qingmu Peak Master Zhu Ming beside him and said, "Now I'll trouble Peak Master Zhu to go to White Stone Road and bring Wen Peak Master's body back."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Ming, who had been silent all along, immediately nodded.</p><p></p><p>Yan Ren and the other Crimson Flame Peak elders still wanted to say something, but now that Ouyang Lie's words had fallen, they could only hold back the rest of their words.</p><p></p><p>When the Sect Master speaks,</p><p></p><p>it is naturally not something ordinary elders can oppose.</p><p></p><p>If Wen Jiao were still alive, the Crimson Flame Peak would at least have a powerful backer.</p><p></p><p>But now that Wen Jiao is dead, the strength of the Crimson Flame Peak has greatly declined, and at this time to further provoke Ouyang Lie's displeasure would only bring more trouble.</p><p></p><p>Where there are people, there is the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Conflicts were endless within the sect.</p><p></p><p>Elder Yan Ren and the others from the Crimson Flame Peak sighed inwardly, as Elder Wen Jiao's death had fallen, the other peaks would likely take some action as well.</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>The Zhuo Family.</p><p></p><p>When Zhuo Peak learned of the news circulating in the jianghu, a look of shock also appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Hegemon Sword Gu Qingfeng!"</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that I had still underestimated him--"</p><p></p><p>Upon learning the news that Wen Jiao had been slain by Gu Qingfeng, Zhuo Peak's instinctive reaction was disbelief.</p><p></p><p>But after several confirmations,</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Peak finally accepted this fact.</p><p></p><p>The Zhuo Peak of the past had already estimated Gu Qingfeng's strength to the best of his ability, but until now, this Zhuo Family elder finally realized that he had still underestimated the other party.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength,</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Peak was confident that he was stronger than Wen Jiao, but only to a limited extent.</p><p></p><p>That is to say,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng, who was able to slay Wen Jiao, would also have the strength to slay him.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the decision of the Peak Elder was correct, Gu Qingfeng is indeed no ordinary person, to be able to slay Wen Jiao with a single strike, his strength is at least at the third realm of Refining Impurity, and may even have stepped into the fourth realm.</p><p></p><p>To have such cultivation at this age, the probability of him breaking through to the Sect Master level in the future is very high."</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Family's patriarch, Zhuo Xuankong, nodded slightly, his expression also slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Although martial artists are not as good as sorcerers, for sorcerers to break through the Spiritual Realm and step into an even higher level is no easy task.</p><p></p><p>A martial artist with the prospect of becoming a Sect Master in the future is not someone we need to offend."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, with Wen Jiao's death, the Crimson Flame Sect will likely be enraged, which will be beneficial for us Zhuo Family to stabilize the situation in the Taishan Dao."</p><p></p><p>Saying this,</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Xuankong's face already had a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>Originally,</p><p></p><p>the Zhuo Family's ambition to dominate the Taishan Dao had already borne a lot of pressure, but now that Gu Qingfeng has displayed such strength, he can to a certain extent divert the attention away from the Zhuo Family.</p><p></p><p>In Zhuo Xuankong's view, this could not be better.</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p></p><p>the Zhuo Family and the Gu Family Villa have no enmity, on the contrary, they have some goodwill between them.</p><p></p><p>In this way,</p><p></p><p>even if the Gu Family Villa is powerful, for the time being, there is no possibility of it posing a threat to the Zhuo Family.</p><p></p><p>There were also Zhuo Family elders who nodded: "That's right, if this person becomes a Sect Master, if our Zhuo Family can recruit him, we will definitely have a top-tier powerhouse in the future."</p><p></p><p>"But the fear is, even if this person submits to our Zhuo Family in the future, it is not certain that he will be truly sincere."</p><p></p><p>There were also elders with a calm expression.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Xuankong's expression was calm: "This problem is not too big, our Zhuo Family's Refining Heart Glyph is not ordinary, as long as we plant the Refining Heart Glyph, even if he breaks through the Spiritual Realm and beyond in the future, there is no possibility of him escaping the control of our Zhuo Family."</p><p></p><p>When they heard the three words "Refining Heart Glyph", the others all had a look of relief.</p><p></p><p>That's right.</p><p></p><p>Their Zhuo Family still has the Refining Heart Glyph.</p><p></p><p>And it is precisely because of the existence of the Refining Heart Glyph that the Zhuo Family can recruit many powerful outsiders to serve the family.</p><p></p><p>With the Refining Heart Glyph,</p><p></p><p>everything is not a problem.</p><p></p><p>Then,</p><p></p><p>the Zhuo Family also has absolute confidence that they can make Gu Qingfeng willingly have the Refining Heart Glyph planted on him.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's put the matter of the Gu Family Villa aside for now, let them fight it out with the Crimson Flame Sect, and next we will focus on supporting the Divine Calamity Gate, completely driving out the other sects and families."</p><p></p><p>"In the future, the Taishan Dao can only have one voice, and that is the voice of our Zhuo Family!"</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Xuankong's eyes were domineering, and his voice also became much colder.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 80</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Tyrant Sword True Intent Level 6!"</p><p></p><p>A cold glint suddenly appeared in Gu Qingfeng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after.</p><p></p><p>He activated the Tyrant Sword True Intent, directly assaulting the Patriarch True Intent, and unleashing the hidden Patriarch True Intent within.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The two collided.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's Level 6 Tyrant Sword True Intent was shattered.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng understood.</p><p></p><p>"The Level 6 Tyrant Sword True Intent is only the threshold of the Patriarch True Intent, but compared to the Patriarch True Intent depicted in the portrait, it is still far inferior!"</p><p></p><p>According to the Zhuo family's explanation.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch True Intent here was left behind by a powerful expert close to the Grand Patriarch level.</p><p></p><p>The True Intent left behind by such a powerful expert is naturally something that he cannot match at the moment.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>This time, Gu Qingfeng could clearly feel that the True Intent contained in the portrait was weaker than before.</p><p></p><p>It can be seen that.</p><p></p><p>The True Intent here is not an eternal and indestructible existence.</p><p></p><p>With the passage of time, and every time someone comprehends it, the power of the True Intent will be consumed.</p><p></p><p>"Only by reaching Level 6 True Intent can one step into the Patriarch realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Only by mastering True Intent above Level 6 can one be truly called a Minor Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>"Although the Level 2 Slaughter True Intent is powerful, compared to the Level 6 True Intent, it is more than just a difference in level."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng clenched his fists, and the information about the Tyrant Sword Slash appeared in his mind one by one.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that.</p><p></p><p>With this comprehension of the Tyrant Sword Slash.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng can be considered a true Minor Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Until his cultivation also reaches the Patriarch realm, only then can he be considered a true Patriarch expert.</p><p></p><p>This time.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng's cultivation did not break through.</p><p></p><p>But with the mastery of the true Tyrant Sword Slash, his strength has doubled directly.</p><p></p><p>This effect.</p><p></p><p>Is much stronger than breaking through the second stage of Refining Impurities.</p><p></p><p>After all, once the Tyrant Sword Slash is unleashed, Gu Qingfeng is confident in instantly defeating his former self.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng turned his attention to other aspects.</p><p></p><p>The Refining Blood Pill and Refining Bone Pill need not be mentioned, as they are old friends.</p><p></p><p>Then.</p><p></p><p>There is the Marrow Cleansing Pill.</p><p></p><p>This is the first time Gu Qingfeng has obtained a pill related to the Marrow Cleansing realm.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the Refining Blood Pill and Refining Bone Pill not only could enhance the cultivator's strength, but also temper the cultivator's foundation, the benefits of which need not be elaborated.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Any kind of pill has its limit.</p><p></p><p>After taking about a hundred Refining Bone Pills, the enhancement of the foundation will reach its limit.</p><p></p><p>And Gu Qingfeng had already gradually refined his entire Golden Bone in the previous period by taking a hundred Refining Bone Pills.</p><p></p><p>Now, his Golden Bone is more than twice as powerful as cultivators at the same level.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>The Refining Bone Pill is truly useless for Gu Qingfeng at the moment.</p><p></p><p>A hundred Refining Bone Pills is the limit.</p><p></p><p>Continuing to take them would only enhance his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But the problem is.</p><p></p><p>The Refining Bone Pill can only enhance the cultivation of cultivators at the Refining Bone realm, and Gu Qingfeng is already a Minor Patriarch of the Refining Impurities realm, so taking them would be a waste.</p><p></p><p>However——</p><p></p><p>The Marrow Cleansing Pill is different.</p><p></p><p>This is the first time Gu Qingfeng has obtained such a pill, and taking it can enhance his foundation, to a certain extent, his strength can be taken to a higher level.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>Among the many rewards.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Tempering Technique is the one that Gu Qingfeng is most concerned about.</p><p></p><p>A secret technique!</p><p></p><p>This is the first time he has heard of it.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng took the secret technique out of his item pouch...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When he took it out and carefully reviewed it, he finally understood what the secret technique was.</p><p></p><p>It was different from martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The secret technique was a special method.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation technique for swords that Gu Qingfeng obtained this time was about how to nurture the spirit of the weapon with one's own qi and blood, until the two become in perfect harmony, like an extension of one's own body.</p><p></p><p>Not only that.</p><p></p><p>This sword cultivation technique could even slowly raise the realm of the spiritual weapon.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, the power of the sword cultivation technique was far greater than the supreme martial arts.</p><p></p><p>However, the sword cultivation technique required time and refinement.</p><p></p><p>After all, nurturing a sword is not a one-day task.</p><p></p><p>It requires daily infusion of one's own fresh blood, along with specific methods, over the course of many years, in order to truly achieve the level of harmony.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, there was a prerequisite for cultivating the sword technique.</p><p></p><p>That is, the warrior must have grasped the true essence.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In half a day's time, Gu Qingfeng had committed all the knowledge of the sword cultivation technique to memory, and then took out the Zhu Xie Dao.</p><p></p><p>The long sword was unsheathed.</p><p></p><p>The slightly yellowed blade flashed with a cold light.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng focused his mind, recalling the details of the sword cultivation technique, and then cut his own finger with the long sword, allowing his fresh blood to flow from the wound.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Gu Qingfeng became completely focused, using the blood as ink to meticulously carve mysterious patterns onto the blade.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Gu Qingfeng also needed to constantly activate the long sword with his true essence, in order to awaken the spirituality of the sword and accelerate the sword cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Only by doing so could it be considered true sword cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, simply nurturing it with blood would not count as true sword cultivation, and would not achieve much effect.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng finished the last stroke, the blade began to emit a faint glow, and all the blood mysteriously seeped into the sword, disappearing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Observing the Zhu Xie Dao, the originally yellowish blade now had a faint reddish hue, adding an eerie aura to it.</p><p></p><p>"This completes the first round of sword cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's gaze fell upon the Zhu Xie Dao, and for the first time, he seemed to sense a slight connection between himself and the sword.</p><p></p><p>However, this connection was very weak and not easily perceptible.</p><p></p><p>This was normal.</p><p></p><p>The sword cultivation technique could not be accomplished overnight.</p><p></p><p>As he continued to cultivate the sword in the future, the effects would naturally become more apparent.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day, Gu Qingfeng met with Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the Blood Refining intermediate stage, Gu Yang's aura had become even more powerful, but more importantly, there was a faint aura of killing intent around him.</p><p></p><p>This was a change brought about by excessive killing.</p><p></p><p>"Have you killed many people these days?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng picked up the tea cup and took a sip, then fixed his gaze on the other person.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang nodded and said, "These people have disrupted my Bai Shi Dao, disregarded the reputation of the Gu Family Manor, and ruthlessly slaughtered many. I had to use iron-fisted methods to suppress them.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if I let these people continue their rampage, the Bai Shi Dao will descend into complete chaos!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke these words, the killing intent around Gu Yang became even more apparent.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at him for a few breaths, then nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, you can kill those people, but don't let the killing cloud your true heart, or it will not be beneficial for your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"I understand, Father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression became serious, and his face grew resolute.</p><p></p><p>"But as you said, the order of this world is decaying. I may not be able to control the entire world, but I can control the Bai Shi Dao. To restore the order of the Bai Shi Dao, I can only use killing to stop the killing!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

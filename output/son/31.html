        <h1>Chapter 31</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng's face broke into a smile.</p><p></p><p>He had been stuck at the Refined Skin realm for many years, unable to break through, both because he lacked the corresponding cultivation method and because the Refined Blood realm was difficult to break through.</p><p></p><p>After all, in terms of natural talent, Meng Peng was not considered powerful.</p><p></p><p>If he only had the complete Gu Family Fist and no Refined Blood Pill to assist him, it would take Meng Peng a year or more to break through the Refined Blood realm.</p><p></p><p>This was also because Meng Peng had accumulated for many years.</p><p></p><p>So, the Refined Blood Pill played a huge role in helping him break through the Refined Blood realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded, "You were able to break through the Refined Blood realm, that's not bad. What reactions have the various forces had so far?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Meng Peng's smile disappeared, and his expression became slightly unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>"So far, only a few small forces have sent people, like the Qin Family and the Tianyun Sect. The major forces like them have shown no signs of movement."</p><p></p><p>"And because the Qin Family and Tianyun Sect haven't made a move, the other forces are also just watching from the sidelines."</p><p></p><p>"In my opinion, this matter may not end well..."</p><p></p><p>The words had already been spoken, but the response was sparse.</p><p></p><p>In Meng Peng's view, the Gu Family seemed to be in a dilemma.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Gu Family really couldn't settle accounts with all the forces? Thinking about this, Meng Peng shook his head inwardly.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he didn't believe in Gu Qingfeng's strength, but to rely on his own power to confront the entire White Stone Dao was ultimately too difficult.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, a gleam of determination flashed in Gu Qingfeng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Not end well? Then don't end it. I've already given them a chance. Since they don't cherish it, then there's nothing more to say."</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Meng Peng was startled.</p><p></p><p>"Does the master really intend to take action against them?"</p><p></p><p>"Why not take action?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng glanced at Meng Peng, his expression cold and murderous.</p><p></p><p>"I've shown them face, but they're unwilling to show the Gu Family face. Then there's nothing more to say, the jianghu ultimately speaks with fists.</p><p></p><p>As long as they dare not heed my words, it means they think my fists are not strong enough.</p><p></p><p>Next, I'll let them see just how strong the Gu Family's fists are!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Gu Family's main hall, several people were sitting upright and tense.</p><p></p><p>When they saw Gu Qingfeng and Meng Peng arrive, they all hurriedly stood up and saluted.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Gu Family Master!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng came and sat down in the main seat, smiling calmly.</p><p></p><p>"No need for formalities, please have a seat."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master Gu!"</p><p></p><p>The others then sat down.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Gu Qingfeng's gaze swept over the people in front of him, and the corresponding information appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family had been in the White Stone Dao for these years, so they naturally understood the jianghu forces here.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Family Martial Arts Hall - Zhou Yuan! Four Seas Gang - Gu Xinghai! </p><p>Poison Hand Sect - Bai Du the Elder!</p><p>Purple Bamboo Manor - Mu Rong Xiu!</p><p></p><p>The first two were Refined Skin realm martial artists, while the latter two were at the half-step Refined Blood realm.</p><p></p><p>Overall, these four forces were not too big or too small in the White Stone Dao. Although they didn't have Refined Blood realm martial artists as their mainstays, their foundations were not weak either.</p><p></p><p>Being under Gu Qingfeng's gaze, the few people all felt a tremendous pressure bearing down on them, causing any remaining thoughts in their minds to dissipate without a trace.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they understood that the strength of this Gu Family Master was likely even more terrifying than the rumors.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "I'm glad you all could come to the Gu Family."</p><p></p><p>"I won't beat around the bush. I plan to unify the White Stone Dao, and if you agree, I can even provide you with opportunities to break through to the Refined Blood realm."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If you do not agree, you can leave right now, but once you step out of the Gu family's door, you and I will be enemies from that day on!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not waste any more words, but directly got to the point and gave the others a choice.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the people from the four major factions changed constantly, obviously also shocked by Gu Qingfeng's words.</p><p></p><p>Although they had already mentally prepared themselves before coming, they still did not expect the other party to be so straightforward.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>The Elder Hundred Poisons of the Poison Hand Sect was the first to cupped his hands in salute.</p><p></p><p>"The Poison Hand Sect is willing to be loyal to the Gu family in the future!"</p><p></p><p>"The Zhou Family Martial Arts Hall is also willing to be loyal to the Gu family in the future!"</p><p></p><p>"The Four Seas Gang..."</p><p></p><p>"The Purple Bamboo Manor..."</p><p></p><p>With the Elder Hundred Poisons taking the lead, the other three also no longer hesitated and directly expressed their loyalty.</p><p></p><p>The current world is in chaos, and the White Stone Dao is also not peaceful.</p><p></p><p>Even if they did not think the Gu family had the strength to unify the entire White Stone Dao, at least with a powerful figure like Gu Qingfeng in charge, the Gu family would definitely not be inferior.</p><p></p><p>If they could ally themselves with the Gu family, it would be like gaining a powerful backing.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention anything else.</p><p></p><p>At least on the rivers and lakes, they would have more protection.</p><p></p><p>"Very good, all of you will be glad for your choice today. It seems that the other factions do not intend to come, since they are not coming, I, Gu, will pay them a visit!"</p><p></p><p>A cold and ruthless smile appeared on Gu Qingfeng's lips.</p><p></p><p>His words.</p><p></p><p>Made the few people all stunned.</p><p></p><p>Mou Rong Xiu cautiously asked, "Does the Lord of the Gu family really intend to take action against the other factions?"</p><p></p><p>"Gu has never spoken in vain!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes were fierce.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the few people were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng immediately ordered Meng Peng beside him to mobilize the Gu family guards and march towards the Qin family.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the people of the other factions could only grit their teeth and follow.</p><p></p><p>They had just bowed to the Gu family, if they did not follow now, they would surely be dealt with by the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>At this point.</p><p></p><p>They could only follow the Gu family to the end.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>When the Gu family made a move, the Qin family was the first to receive the news.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning that Gu Qingfeng was leading others to rush towards the Qin family, Qin Hongtan's expression was also shocked and angry.</p><p></p><p>He could not believe.</p><p></p><p>That the Gu family dared to attack the Qin family without reason.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely.</p><p></p><p>Qin Hongtan already had some regrets in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Since it involved the face of the Qin family, at this point, Qin Hongtan could only maintain a tough attitude, gather all the Qin family warriors, and then personally go to the backyard to invite the Qin family's ancestor.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng led the people to the Qin family, the Qin family was already on high alert.</p><p></p><p>The Qin family's patriarch Qin Hongtan, as well as the Qin family's ancestor, were all present.</p><p></p><p>"The Lord of the Gu family has brought so many people to my Qin family, I wonder what is the purpose?"</p><p></p><p>The Qin family's ancestor spoke first.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the other party.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the Qin family's ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>The person in front of him, although old, still had a powerful aura and blood energy. To possess such strength, he must have at least reached the level of Refining Blood Perfection, so his identity was naturally obvious.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for the Qin family's ancestor to respond.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's icy gaze swept across the other Qin family members, his expression full of killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"I give you Qin family one chance to submit to my Gu family, otherwise, the Qin family will have no reason to exist!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

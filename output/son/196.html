        <h1>Chapter 196</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' led the powerful cultivators of the Divine Martial Sect to attack the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' slew 236 Refine Skin realm martial artists!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' slew 178 Refine Blood realm martial artists!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' slew 89 Refine Bone realm martial artists!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' slew 36 Wash Marrow realm martial artists!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' slew 3 Refine Viscera realm martial artists!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' used the Eradicate Evil Dagger to slay a Metamorphosis realm cultivator, causing a great commotion!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' gained insights from the battles and slaughter, correspondingly increasing his strength!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Gu Qingfeng returned to the Gu Family Manor, the information panel kept updating constantly. When he saw the destruction of the Pei Family, his expression did not change much.</p><p></p><p>The Pei Family was destroyed.</p><p></p><p>This was an inevitable outcome.</p><p></p><p>The small Pei Family.</p><p></p><p>How much foundation could they have?</p><p></p><p>Even though the Pei Family was the governor of the Southern Yang Prefecture, controlling an entire prefecture, but with the death of Pei Jing, the Pei Family had already suffered a heavy blow. Now, how could the Pei Family withstand the power under Gu Yang's command.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>The destruction of the Pei Family was not something surprising.</p><p></p><p>It was only when he saw Gu Yang slaying a Metamorphosis realm cultivator with the Eradicate Evil Dagger that Gu Qingfeng's gaze showed some fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>It was only a slight fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng understood the power of the Eradicate Evil Dagger. He had nurtured this divine weapon with his Refine Sword Technique for many years, and it was constantly being tempered by the true essence. Now, he had even left a drop of his essence blood in the dagger, so slaying ordinary Metamorphosis realm cultivators was not a problem.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>If it were to face experts at the level of the Ancient Heavenly Emperor, it might not be enough.</p><p></p><p>But the Ancient Heavenly Emperor had died, and for the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect to produce a Metamorphosis realm cultivator was already difficult. The difficulty of producing another top-tier expert could be imagined.</p><p></p><p>"After this battle, the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect will no longer exist in the Qingyun State!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was indifferent as he took out the jade bottle containing the severed finger. This was something he obtained after slaying the evil entity of the Blood Mountain Mansion.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Qingfeng's eyes, this severed finger should be on a similar level to the previous drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>The moment the finger appeared, Gu Qingfeng could see that it still emanated a vigorous life force, as if the finger in front of him was a living being, not a dead object.</p><p></p><p>There was a divine aura flowing on it, exuding a terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng focused his attention on the finger, he suddenly saw a vision of a desolate and ruined world, with countless corpses and skeletons piled up. A finger descended from the nine heavens, shattering the layers of void and sky, reducing all the bones and corpses to dust.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a blood light slashed through the endless void, coming towards him.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the finger shattered, and blood splattered across the sky.</p><p></p><p>The scene then abruptly ended.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng remained dumbfounded at the spot. That blood light that slashed through the void and the finger seemed to be deeply imprinted in his mind, unable to be erased.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng focused his attention and observed that blood light again, he finally saw what it truly was.</p><p></p><p>It was a blade!</p><p></p><p>To be precise, it was a powerful strike unleashed by a mysterious existence.</p><p></p><p>That strike.</p><p></p><p>Slashed through the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>Slashed through the laws of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>And it also severed the finger in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven's Sword Technique that Gu Qingfeng had mastered was a true Grand Master martial art, but compared to this strike, it was like the difference between a firefly and the bright moon.</p><p></p><p>"This strike must have reached the level of transcending the Dao," Gu Qingfeng murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>He was proud of creating the Heaven's Sword Technique, but now, compared to this strike, the gap was clearly revealed.</p><p></p><p>The cut on the finger still had lingering sword intent that refused to dissipate.</p><p></p><p>This sword intent, even just a wisp of it, was filled with a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had a premonition that if he could comprehend this sword intent and incorporate it into his own cultivation, the Heaven's Sword Technique could ascend to an even higher level.</p><p></p><p>This was a great opportunity! It was a true great opportunity. Just like the drop of blood left behind by the fallen Demonic Buddha of the Nine Curved Path, it was also a significant opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng understood that if he could refine that drop of blood, he would definitely gain immense power from it.</p><p></p><p>However, that drop of blood had given birth to a demonic entity, and Gu Qingfeng had no intention of recklessly attempting to harness such an uncontrollable power.</p><p></p><p>But the severed finger was different. The lingering sword intent on it could be comprehended to some extent.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Gu Qingfeng recalled the scene he had just witnessed, and his gaze towards the finger became more solemn.</p><p></p><p>"This finger, not knowing how many years it has been severed, can still retain such divine might. It is clear that the owner of this finger must be an extraordinary expert."</p><p></p><p>Beyond Grand Masters! This was undoubtedly the case.</p><p></p><p>But how much more terrifying this existence was compared to Grand Masters, he could not know.</p><p></p><p>"The Demonic Buddha of the Nine Curved Path contributed a drop of blood, and the evil entity of the Blood Mountain Mansion contributed this severed finger. It seems that the truly powerful demonic entities in the world may have various opportunities hidden within them."</p><p></p><p>Of course, this still needed further verification.</p><p></p><p>But if he had the chance...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I can exterminate all the evil spirits in the world and see if I can find any other opportunities!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered in secret. But for him right now, the most important thing was to comprehend the inextinguishable sword intent left on the severed finger.</p><p></p><p>And then, it was to completely perfect the final "Refining the Impurities" chapter of the Longevity Sutra.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Gu Qingfeng's mind sank into the severed finger.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he seemed to re-enter that desolate world, but this time the so-called owner of the severed finger was nowhere to be seen, and he was the only living being in the world.</p><p></p><p>Next, he saw the blood-red sword light that slashed through the universe.</p><p></p><p>Faced with such powerful sword intent, Gu Qingfeng felt as if he was falling into an eternal abyss, his body and blood qi stagnant, almost unable to move at all.</p><p></p><p>But just as the blood-red sword light was about to strike him, Gu Qingfeng took a step forward, and the ruthless sword intent suddenly burst out, with the true essence of the Ten-Grade Heaven Sword erupting.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The two forces collided, and the true essence of the Heaven Sword was annihilated on the spot, like being thoroughly destroyed.</p><p></p><p>And at the moment the true essence of the Heaven Sword was extinguished, Gu Qingfeng's consciousness had already perished in the world.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>In the Whetstone Hall, Gu Qingfeng only felt his head splitting with pain, and his forehead was slightly sweating.</p><p></p><p>He had just fought the sword intent in the severed finger in the invisible realm, but it was clear that he was utterly defeated in the face of that inextinguishable sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Especially at the moment when the sword intent was about to strike him, Gu Qingfeng felt as if he was truly approaching death.</p><p></p><p>But fortunately, it was only an illusion.</p><p></p><p>However, the power of that sword and the feeling of facing death had been deeply imprinted in Gu Qingfeng's mind.</p><p></p><p>This was an opportunity! </p><p></p><p>But also a peril!</p><p></p><p>If ordinary people were to fear such sword intent, it would become their own inner demon, and they would never make any progress.</p><p></p><p>But if one could overcome the shock of such sword intent, there was hope to utilize it to temper oneself and advance further.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, Gu Qingfeng belonged to the latter category.</p><p></p><p>Although the inextinguishable sword intent was powerful, and the threat of facing death was terrifying, Gu Qingfeng had reached this point, his hands stained with countless lives, and he had never feared life and death.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this inextinguishable sword intent deeply imprinted in his mind was completely transformed by Gu Qingfeng into the nourishment for the Heaven Sword, and various insights surged in his heart, allowing him to gain more understanding of the Heaven Sword he had created for the first time.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the following time, Gu Qingfeng devoted himself to comprehending the inextinguishable sword intent, and only in his leisure time did he delve into the "Refining the Impurities" chapter of the Longevity Sutra.</p><p></p><p>Every time his body and spirit were annihilated by the inextinguishable sword intent, Gu Qingfeng was able to gain more insights from it.</p><p></p><p>It was just that the feeling of facing death and having one's soul seemingly slashed was not something that ordinary martial artists could endure.</p><p></p><p>Once or twice was fine.</p><p></p><p>But if it continued for a long time, it would inevitably lead to an inner demon.</p><p></p><p>And during Gu Qingfeng's seclusion, the current Tian Yang Sword Sect in the South Yang Prefecture had been completely reduced to ruins.</p><p></p><p>There were numerous golden coffins appearing on the ruins of the Tian Yang Sword Sect, each containing a powerful evil spirit that had been sealed.</p><p></p><p>These evil spirits were from the Tian Yang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>After all, as an immortal sect, the Tian Yang Sword Sect had many powerful cultivators, and to prevent the evil spirits from causing chaos in the world, Gu Yang had already made comprehensive preparations.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, after all the powerful experts of the Tian Yang Sword Sect perished, the evil spirits that revived were all suppressed by Gu Yang immediately.</p><p></p><p>And in front of the shattered main hall of the Tian Yang Sword Sect, there was a severed head, the face filled with resentment and disbelief, the expression already frozen.</p><p></p><p>This severed head belonged to the current Sect Master of the Tian Yang Sword Sect, Ancient Divine Penetration.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the power of the Demon-Slaying Sword, Gu Yang struck him down with a single blow, severing his head and sealing the revival of his evil spirit, completely destroying the top combat power of the Tian Yang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>"The Tian Yang Sword Sect has finally been destroyed!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression was calm.</p><p></p><p>The existence of an immortal sect had always been like a great mountain weighing on his heart, but now that the Tian Yang Sword Sect had been destroyed, the great mountain on his heart had finally been removed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a scout hurriedly came to report.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the scout has brought news that the rebel armies and the imperial armies are now converging on the Tian Yang Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, the powerful experts of the Ancient Cloud Sect all had their expressions change slightly.</p><p></p><p>This situation was something they had anticipated.</p><p></p><p>But when it actually happened, they still felt immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>After all, no matter how powerful a Sect Master was, they were still human, and there would be a time when their strength was exhausted. Once they were surrounded by chaotic armies, even a Sect Master would have difficulty escaping death.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the change in the expressions of the others, Gu Yang remained much calmer.</p><p></p><p>He said to the scout, "Continue to investigate the situation outside, and report any changes to this king immediately!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>The scout hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>Then, Gu Yang looked at the others and issued a decisive order.</p><p></p><p>"The Tian Yang Sword Sect is easy to defend but difficult to attack. From now on, everyone will defend the Tian Yang Sword Sect and wait for reinforcements to arrive!"</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

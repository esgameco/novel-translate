        <h1>Chapter 37</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the main hall of the Gu family, Meng Peng spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, his gaze towards Gu Qingfeng was filled with admiration.</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng had joined the Gu family from the beginning, and he had witnessed the Gu family's gradual rise.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that Gu Qingfeng could make the Gu family grow into a colossal force in just a few years.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, have everyone pay attention to the news from Guangyang Prefecture and Taishan County. Also, keep a close eye on Danyang County."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The jianghu (martial arts world) can be vast, but it can also be small. On a larger scale, the jianghu covers the entire land, but on a smaller scale, even a single faction is part of the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>Although the Gu family has unified the entire Baishi Path, it is still just the Baishi Path.</p><p></p><p>The Baishi Path is only a part of Guangyang Prefecture, and above Guangyang Prefecture lies Taishan County, and above Taishan County is the vast Qingyun State.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, Gu Qingfeng would not be arrogant or complacent.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the Iron Bone Gang wanting to make a move against the Gu family, Gu Qingfeng would not have acted so openly.</p><p></p><p>But now that things have reached this point, it is impossible for the Gu family to retreat.</p><p></p><p>Unifying the Baishi Path is bound to draw the attention of other forces.</p><p></p><p>What can be done now is to meet force with force and defend as needed.</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng nodded and then said, "Should we go greet the imperial court?"</p><p></p><p>"No need to bother. The current Taixuan Dynasty is already struggling to take care of itself. In the past, when the Qin family and other forces were present, the imperial court also had nothing to do with the jianghu."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng waved his hand, having no intention of facing the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>The Baishi Path is different from Linxian County. The jianghu forces in Linxian County are weak, so they naturally have to consider the imperial court's officials.</p><p></p><p>But the jianghu forces in the Baishi Path are much stronger. Unless necessary, the imperial court does not want to get entangled with the forces in the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>Especially now, with rebellions erupting in various places, the Taixuan Dynasty has no intention of provoking the different factions.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, as long as the jianghu forces do not threaten the foundation of the imperial court and do not directly rebel, the imperial court will turn a blind eye.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, Gu Qingfeng has no intention of creating trouble for himself.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he took out a piece of paper and handed it to Meng Peng.</p><p></p><p>"Gather all the medicinal ingredients listed on this. I have a great use for them."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng looked at the list of medicinal ingredients, some of which he had never even heard of before, but this was not a big problem.</p><p></p><p>With the entire Baishi Path mobilized, finding these medicinal ingredients should be a simple task.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng had Meng Peng take his leave.</p><p></p><p>The majority of the medicinal ingredients Gu Qingfeng had Meng Peng collect were for the Temper Bone Decoction.</p><p></p><p>The formula for the Temper Bone Decoction was something Gu Qingfeng had obtained from the Qin family after eliminating them.</p><p></p><p>The Temper Bone Decoction has only one purpose: to accelerate the breakthrough of Blood Refining realm cultivators to the Bone Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng is now at the half-step Bone Refining realm, and with the unique properties of the Scorching Yang Palm, he can gradually break through to the Bone Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>However, relying solely on the Scorching Yang Palm to break through would be too slow.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng needs to break through faster.</p><p></p><p>The half-step Bone Refining realm may seem close to the Bone Refining realm, but the gap between them is certainly not small.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Gu family has unified the entire Baishi Path, it is possible that other forces will take notice. At this time, only with sufficient strength can all troubles be truly resolved.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Temper Bone Decoction is indispensable.</p><p></p><p>Of course, a small portion of the medicinal ingredients Gu Qingfeng had Meng Peng collect were for the breakthrough of Skin Refining realm cultivators to the Blood Refining realm, as well as for the cultivation of Blood Refining realm cultivators themselves.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>To grow stronger, there must be enough powerful figures to hold the fort. In the past, the Gu family was weak, so it was not easy to gather these things, but now with the entire White Stone Dao mobilized, it would be different.</p><p></p><p>—</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>It has been over a month since Gu Qingfeng unified the White Stone Dao.</p><p></p><p>On this day.</p><p></p><p>The entire Gu family was on high alert.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was pacing back and forth in front of the bedroom, listening to the sounds coming from inside, his face occasionally showing some anxious expressions.</p><p></p><p>It's simple.</p><p></p><p>Because Xu Yulan was about to give birth.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng had the experience of being a father once before, he still couldn't help but feel nervous.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang stood beside him and said, "Father, don't worry, Mother is blessed, there will definitely be no problem—"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yulan was now Gu Qingfeng's legitimate wife, so Gu Yang naturally addressed her as Mother.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly, "I hope so, and you take care of the Gu family's affairs, don't let anyone disturb Yulan's childbirth."</p><p></p><p>"I understand, son!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang withdrew, following Gu Qingfeng's instructions, leading a portion of the Gu family guards to maintain strict security in all directions.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Someone whispered, "Young Master, do we really have to do this?"</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at the person in front of him, his brow slightly furrowed. He recognized the person's identity, a guard who had joined the Gu family for many years, named Liu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Liu Yuan glanced towards the inner courtyard, his eyes flickering.</p><p></p><p>"After all, the Young Master is not the heir of the Mistress. Now that I observe the situation of the Family Head, he seems to dote on the Mistress quite a lot. If we really let the Mistress give birth to the Young Master, in the future, it may threaten the Young Master's position.</p><p></p><p>In my opinion, we should—"</p><p></p><p>Liu Yuan made a gesture with his hand, his expression turning ruthless.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression remained unchanged as he stared directly at the other party.</p><p></p><p>"Who told you to say these words?"</p><p></p><p>"These words are my innermost thoughts. In these years, who does not serve the Young Master in managing the family affairs? I do this for your consideration—"</p><p></p><p>Liu Yuan's words were not finished when Gu Yang suddenly struck, directly twisting his neck.</p><p></p><p>Until death.</p><p></p><p>Liu Yuan's eyes were wide open, completely unprepared.</p><p></p><p>After killing Liu Yuan, Gu Yang immediately summoned the others.</p><p></p><p>"Come, drag the body away, and then thoroughly investigate this person's identity to see if there are others who want to harm my Gu family!"</p><p></p><p>"Understood, sir—"</p><p></p><p>Several guards who heard the news hurriedly came, and after seeing Liu Yuan's body, they first paused, then quickly followed the order and dragged the body away.</p><p></p><p>Dealing with Liu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's heart was not much disturbed.</p><p></p><p>Although he was not yet old, after managing the Gu family for these years, his hands were already stained with blood, killing a person was nothing to him.</p><p></p><p>Dealing with Liu Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked towards the inner courtyard, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>Liu Yuan's words did not make Gu Yang worry at all.</p><p></p><p>The position of the Gu family's young master is his, and can only be his, this Gu Yang is absolutely confident about.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention anything else.</p><p></p><p>He has only been on the martial path for six or seven years, but has already reached the peak of Refining Skin, and breaking through the Refining Blood realm is a done deal.</p><p></p><p>With such talent, Gu Yang is not worried that anyone can shake his position.</p><p></p><p>Liu Yuan's actions, although seemingly for his own good, were actually harboring evil intentions, and this is why Gu Yang directly delivered the fatal blow.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

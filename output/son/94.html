        <h1>Chapter 94</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"What is causing such panic?" </p><p></p><p>"Father, the Jiuqu Sword Sect is gone!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said directly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng heard this and his expression changed slightly: "I've heard that the Jiuqu Sword Sect is the top force of the Jiuqu Dao. That Jiuqu Sword Sect Sect Master, Li Qingwai, also known as the Sword Lord, has cultivated to the Refining Bone Realm. Unless some ancient sects or powerful families intervene, it shouldn't be easy to destroy the Jiuqu Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>Don't think that the Refining Bone Realm is insignificant in the face of the Gu family's villa.</p><p></p><p>But looking at the jianghu (martial arts world), </p><p></p><p>the Refining Bone Realm already belongs to the truly powerful.</p><p></p><p>The top forces of the Baishi Dao were only at the Refining Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Taishan Dao is stronger than the Baishi Dao, but the Qingyang Sect isn't that powerful either, only having one Refining Evil Ancestor who can rival Washing Marrow Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the powerful ones are at most at the Refining Bone Realm.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>the resources of the Jiuqu Dao are not inferior to the Baishi Dao.</p><p></p><p>Normally,</p><p></p><p>there shouldn't be anyone targeting the Jiuqu Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, the Jiuqu Sword Sect also has other forces backing it up.</p><p></p><p>Just like how the Qin family had the Qingyang Sect supporting them in the past.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said, "The Jiuqu Sword Sect disappeared without a trace overnight, and apart from some bloodstained remains, there is no other sign of activity in the entire sect."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore—"</p><p></p><p>"Some people heard the chanting of Buddhist sutras on the night the Jiuqu Sword Sect vanished, and others claimed to have seen the Buddha descend. Now, there are rumors circulating among the common people that the Jiuqu Sword Sect has incurred the wrath of Heaven, and the Buddha has descended in anger to annihilate them!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's words caused Gu Qingfeng's expression to change slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The Buddha..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that there are truly divine beings in this world?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after,</p><p></p><p>he shook his head.</p><p></p><p>If there were truly divine beings in this world, they would not have only destroyed the Jiuqu Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Demonic forces are rampant,</p><p></p><p>and strange occurrences are widespread.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the evil deeds of the ancient sects and immortal cultivators, the Jiuqu Sword Sect is far from the worst.</p><p></p><p>"The so-called divine beings are not to be trusted. The one who destroyed the Jiuqu Sword Sect is likely that demonic force!"</p><p></p><p>"But to be able to wipe out the Jiuqu Sword Sect in a single night, without a single person escaping, it shows that this demonic force's strength is no simple matter—"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's gaze became solemn.</p><p></p><p>For a demonic force to easily slay the Refining Bone Realm's Li Qing is not a problem.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>to completely annihilate the entire Jiuqu Sword Sect, not allowing a single person to escape, that is a different matter.</p><p></p><p>From this, it can be seen that the demonic force in the Jiuqu Dao must be formidable.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Exorcism Bureau made any moves?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng asked again.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang shook his head: "The Exorcism Bureau has probably received the news, but as for their specific actions, I'm unable to accurately understand that for now."</p><p></p><p>The Exorcism Bureau is a powerful government agency, and with the Gu family villa's current intelligence capabilities, it is completely unrealistic to accurately grasp the Exorcism Bureau's movements.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng understood this.</p><p></p><p>"Continue to keep an eye on the situation in the Jiuqu Dao. If there are any problems, report to me immediately. Remember, without my permission, you absolutely cannot set foot in the Jiuqu Dao!"</p><p></p><p>"Your strength may not be weak, but that demonic force was able to wipe out the entire Jiuqu Sword Sect in a single night. Its power is far from simple—"</p><p></p><p>The demonic force capable of destroying the Jiuqu Sword Sect is certainly not something Gu Yang can contend with. </p><p></p><p>If he rashly enters the Jiuqu Dao and encounters that demonic force,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Father, rest assured, your son knows what he's doing!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Yang nodded.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng didn't say much more, and then let the other party leave first.</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng walked out of the Gu family manor and came to Baishi City. On the way, he also heard many commoners discussing and chatting, and most of the content was related to the Nine Twists Path.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that divine Buddhas descended on the Nine Twists Path, and that night the sky was filled with Buddha's light, and the next day all the members of the sect disappeared!"</p><p></p><p>"Whew, the Buddha descended, could it be that there are truly divine beings in the world?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not strange if there are divine beings. It is rumored that there are supernatural occurrences all over the world now. I heard that outside of Guangyang Prefecture, there is even a statue that speaks human language.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Buddha has descended on the Nine Twists Path, it is not impossible either."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's ears caught these words, but his expression remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>However, from this matter, Gu Qingfeng also indirectly understood one thing.</p><p></p><p>That is, the news about the Nine Twists Path could no longer be suppressed by the court.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, this news would not have spread so widely among the people.</p><p></p><p>If it's like this here, the news must have spread to other places as well.</p><p></p><p>"Next, let's see how the Exorcism Bureau will respond!" Gu Qingfeng mused.</p><p></p><p>He did not stay long in Baishi City, just strolled around a bit, and then returned to the Gu family manor.</p><p></p><p>This trip had no other purpose for Gu Qingfeng, he just wanted to come to Baishi City to take a look, and he had been in seclusion for a long time and had hardly ever left the Gu family manor.</p><p></p><p>Now that he has a clear understanding of the situation in Baishi City, Gu Qingfeng has some ideas.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>Nine Twists Path, Yunshan City.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin, the grand marshal, was sitting in the main seat in the government office, and the Yunshan prefect was standing beside him, with a respectful expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"This official wants all the intelligence about the Nine Swords Sect and the origin of that evil entity!"</p><p></p><p>"Lord Jiang, don't worry, I have already sent people to handle it, and I believe the news will come soon!"</p><p></p><p>The Yunshan prefect smiled apologetically.</p><p></p><p>At this point, his expression became a little hesitant: "Now that the evil entity has destroyed the Nine Swords Sect, is there a possibility that it may set its sights on our Yunshan City next?"</p><p></p><p>"The evil entity's actions are unpredictable, and the lifeblood of our human race is exactly what it likes the most. If that thing really sets its sights on Yunshan City, it is not impossible." </p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin glanced at the other party and spoke indifferently.</p><p></p><p>These words made the Yunshan prefect's face turn even paler.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Jiang Qin said, "But you can rest assured, this time the Exorcism Bureau has taken over, so it is absolutely impossible for that evil entity to run rampant.</p><p></p><p>As long as we find the whereabouts of that evil entity, I will personally take action to subdue it!"</p><p></p><p>"With Lord Jiang's words, then I will be at ease!" </p><p></p><p>The Yunshan prefect's expression finally looked much better. The Exorcism Bureau was well-known, and Jiang Qin, as the deputy commander of the Guangyang Prefecture Exorcism Bureau, had astonishing abilities.</p><p></p><p>Since he had spoken up, it seemed that there would be no problem.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a constable hurriedly walked in from outside and respectfully handed a scroll to Jiang Qin.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Jiang, this is all the scroll about that evil entity, please take a look!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm—"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin nodded slightly, then opened the scroll and looked at the information recorded on it.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

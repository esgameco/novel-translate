        <h1>Chapter 83</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The bustling of the past has now become a deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>Most of the disciples not only had their vital energy drained, but also had a gaping hole in their heads, as if their brains had been completely devoured by something. The rigid expressions on their faces revealed unspeakable terror.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall of the Forging Sword Gate, the Sect Master Stone Kai was kneeling before someone, his face full of humble flattery.</p><p></p><p>Around him, the bodies of many Forging Sword Gate experts lay on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Speak, tell me all the intelligence you have about the Gu Family Manor!" </p><p></p><p>Wen Jiao glanced down at the man, speaking in an indifferent tone.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Stone Kai's body trembled slightly, and he then proceeded to reveal all the information he had about the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Stone Kai kowtowed in a panic, "Please, senior, give me one more chance, even if it's to be a lowly servant, I will gladly accept!"</p><p></p><p>"A lowly servant?" Wen Jiao sneered contemptuously. </p><p></p><p>"A mere Blood Refining Realm cultivator is not even qualified to be my dog."</p><p></p><p>With that, a gust of energy shot out from Wen Jiao's fingertips, instantly piercing through Stone Kai's head. A large amount of white brain matter spilled out, and his body soon stopped moving.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Wen Jiao opened his mouth and absorbed all of Stone Kai's vital energy and brain matter into his own body.</p><p></p><p>"The brain matter of the Blood Refining Realm is still a bit lacking in taste!"</p><p></p><p>"According to his words, the Patriarch of the Gu Family Manor should be a Marrow Cleansing Realm expert!"</p><p></p><p>"However, a Marrow Cleansing Realm cultivator is unlikely to make the Exorcism Pavilion and the Zhuo Family yield."</p><p></p><p>Wen Jiao's eyes turned ice-cold, and a sinister, savage smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>Only Qi Polluting Realm cultivators would be able to truly command respect from powers like the Exorcism Pavilion and the Zhuo Family.</p><p></p><p>In the past, even before cultivating the Qi Polluting technique, Wen Jiao had already reached the Qi Polluting Realm. Now, having cultivated the Qi Polluting technique, he had long since surpassed the Spirit Controlling Realm.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, Wen Jiao had not only slain one or two Qi Polluting Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had started with the Forging Sword Gate, intending to gain a deeper understanding of the Gu Family Manor's strength, to ensure that no problems would arise.</p><p></p><p>After all, caution is the mother of safety.</p><p></p><p>Wen Jiao's ability to survive until now was also due to his prudence and carefulness.</p><p></p><p>But now, he had already grasped the strength of the Gu Family Manor - a suspected Qi Polluting Realm cultivator, and a suspected Bone Refining Realm genius.</p><p></p><p>The remaining Blood Refining Realm cultivators were nothing more than ants in Wen Jiao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"You killed the seeds I painstakingly cultivated, so now I shall have all of the Gu Family Manor accompany them in death. The vital energy and brain matter of a Qi Polluting Realm cultivator should be worth more than thousands of ants!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Jiao let out a cold, mocking laugh, and then his gaze fell on the outside of the hall, where he sensed other cultivators approaching the Forging Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, his figure disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>At the Gu Family Manor, Gu Peng hurriedly walked into the main hall, bowing respectfully to the Patriarch, Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Your subordinate pays respects to the Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>"You seem anxious. Has something happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Patriarch, a while ago, people from the Forging Sword Gate came seeking aid, saying that a mysterious strong cultivator had arrived and was massacring them. I then dispatched two Blood Refining Realm stewards and several disciples to investigate the situation. But until now, there has been no news, and I fear something may be amiss!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng's expression was grave as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>As Gu Yang had recently been causing a commotion...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The turmoil of the Pressure Warriors has calmed down, and the entire White Stone Path has become much quieter, with fewer outside martial artists daring to stir up trouble. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>Under such circumstances, there are still mysterious powerful figures who want to make a move against the Casting Sword Gate.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng's many years of jianghu experience have made him instinctively sense that something is amiss.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>He persuaded Gu Yang, who wanted to go directly to the Casting Sword Gate, and instead dispatched two stewards and several disciples to investigate the situation first.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>The few people have all disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng didn't need to think to know that there must be a big problem.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>The temperature in the hall suddenly rose sharply, and Gu Peng's expression was full of doubt and uncertainty, while Gu Qingfeng looked outside the hall and smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't think too much, the other party has already come to our doorstep!"</p><p></p><p>With that.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stood up and went out of the Gu family manor.</p><p></p><p>Since the other party has already come to the door, he naturally couldn't avoid them.</p><p></p><p>Just right.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also wants to see who dares to make a move on the Gu family manor at this time.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>Outside the Gu family manor.</p><p></p><p>Wen Jiao stood with his hands behind his back, and there were many corpses lying around him, their vital energy and brains completely drained.</p><p></p><p>One of the outer court stewards looked at the other party with a terrified gaze, his body trembling violently.</p><p></p><p>Draining vital energy and brains!</p><p></p><p>Such a method is not something a normal person can possess.</p><p></p><p>Especially the scorching and eerie cold aura emanating from Wen Jiao, as well as the fresh blood at the corners of his mouth, making him look like a demonic ghost, terrifying and horrifying.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying aura of vital energy burst forth.</p><p></p><p>A figure shot out like a cannon shell, and a powerful palm strike was fiercely unleashed, the tremendous force causing the air to suddenly explode.</p><p></p><p>Wen Jiao raised his brow, and likewise struck out with a palm.</p><p></p><p>The two palms collided.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming might surged forth, causing the latter to retreat several steps involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>He finally noticed that in front of the Gu family manor, a figure in blue had appeared, seemingly out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>"You must be Gu Qingfeng!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Jiao licked the corner of his mouth, the towering vital energy force of the other party both shocking him and arousing an unprecedented strong desire within him.</p><p></p><p>"Your vital energy is extremely powerful, it seems you have reached the Refining Impurity realm, no wonder you dared to kill my Crimson Flame Sect disciples!"</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the corpses on the ground, his eyes slightly cold, and then his gaze fell back on the person in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"You are from the Crimson Flame Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Leave your name, lest I don't know who I've killed after your death!"</p><p></p><p>With these words.</p><p></p><p>Wen Jiao immediately burst into angry laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Listen up, young man, I am Wen Jiao, the Peak Master of the Crimson Flame Peak. When you go to the underworld, don't forget who killed you—"</p><p></p><p>Before the words could finish.</p><p></p><p>Wen Jiao suddenly appeared, his figure like a ghostly apparition, the icy cold and scorching hot aura intertwined, causing the air to twist and distort, as if unable to withstand such power.</p><p></p><p>"Sword, come!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stretched out his hand, and Gu Peng immediately threw the Zhu Xie Sword out. Gu Qingfeng grasped the sword hilt, and the long sword was instantly unsheathed.</p><p></p><p>With the sword in hand.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's aura changed.</p><p></p><p>His vital energy converged into the sword, and a tyrannical and bone-chillingly murderous sword intent rose up.</p><p></p><p>"Slay!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng uttered a single word, and the Zhu Xie Sword, imbued with the power to break the heavens, descended.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>PS: Brothers, please give me a monthly vote!!!

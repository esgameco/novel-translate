        <h1>Chapter 139</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Inside the Qingjiang Prefecture, when the prefectural governor Taishi Yi heard this news, his expression changed drastically, and the previous calm demeanor had completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>There was no helping it.</p><p></p><p>This news was simply too astonishing.</p><p></p><p>Taishi Yi was well aware of Pei Jing's strength.</p><p></p><p>In these past few years, Pei Jing had been constantly attacking the Taishan Prefecture, and as the prefectural governor, Taishi Yi had engaged him in battle numerous times.</p><p></p><p>Even though Taishi Yi did not believe that Pei Jing had the potential to dominate the world, his strength was undeniable.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that Pei Jing himself was already a Xiantian Sect Master, and he had the backing of the Tianyang Sword Sect, the hegemon of the Qinyun State.</p><p></p><p>Such a force.</p><p></p><p>To be honest.</p><p></p><p>Was quite formidable in the eyes of the Qinyun State.</p><p></p><p>When Taishi Yi learned that Pei Jing was going to make a move on the Baishi Dao, he had made some preparations, intending to intervene at a critical moment and bring the Gu Family Manor into his own camp.</p><p></p><p>In this way.</p><p></p><p>The Taishan Prefecture would have a top-tier True Meaning Sect Master to defend against Pei Jing's Shenwu Army, thereby increasing the chances of persisting in the decisive battle among the warlords of the Central Plains.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly,</p><p></p><p>Before Taishi Yi could even make a move, shocking news came from the Baishi Dao.</p><p></p><p>The Shenwu King Pei Jing had died.</p><p></p><p>This completely caught Taishi Yi off guard.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>The subordinates kneeled and reported, "Not only has the Shenwu King Pei Jing died, but three Fushen Realm Elders of the Tianyang Sword Sect have also fallen at the hands of Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>According to the information, that Hegemon Blade is not just a True Meaning Sect Master, but a Great Sect Master of the present age!!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The entire prefectural government was shaken.</p><p></p><p>A Great Sect Master!!</p><p></p><p>These three simple words.</p><p></p><p>Contained an indescribable weight.</p><p></p><p>Everyone, including Taishi Yi, could not help but widen their eyes when they heard the words "Great Sect Master", as if they had heard something unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>After a long while.</p><p></p><p>Taishi Yi muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"A Great Sect Master... It's been so many years, I never imagined that my Taishan Prefecture could produce a Great Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Pei Jing was defeated and killed, and no wonder the Gu Family Manor was not afraid of the Tianyang Sword Sect, it turns out that Hegemon Blade is a Great Sect Master of the present age--"</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>All of Taishi Yi's doubts were dispelled, and everything before him became clear.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Qingfeng was a Great Sect Master, then everything could be explained.</p><p></p><p>Why the Gu Family Manor was not afraid of the Tianyang Sword Sect.</p><p>Why the Shenwu King Pei Jing was defeated and killed.</p><p></p><p>It was all because.</p><p>That Hegemon Blade was a rare Great Sect Master of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Although the world says that mages are superior to martial artists, that only applies to ordinary martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Once a martial artist reaches the realm of a Great Sect Master, they cannot be compared to the past.</p><p></p><p>A Great Sect Master of the martial dao.</p><p>The value contained within is self-evident.</p><p></p><p>At this time.</p><p>Someone spoke with a grave expression, "The fall of several Fushen Realm Elders, and even the Pei Jing they supported has perished in Guangyang Prefecture, the Tianyang Sword Sect is likely to be enraged."</p><p></p><p>If it were just the Fushen Realm Elders who died, it would have been fine, but Pei Jing was a tool cultivated by the Tianyang Sword Sect to contend for the domination of the world.</p><p></p><p>Now.</p><p>Pei Jing has died.</p><p>The hidden dragon has been extinguished.</p><p>One can imagine how furious the Tianyang Sword Sect must be.</p><p></p><p>In the current chaotic times, being a step slow means being left behind.</p><p>The Tianyang Sword Sect had cultivated Pei Jing for more than twenty years, and now they have lost him in a single day, which is certainly difficult for them to accept.</p><p></p><p>Taishi Yi's gaze was deep and he said indifferently, "The events that follow will no longer be something we can interfere with."</p><p></p><p>"In the current world, it is ultimately the mages' world."</p><p></p><p>"With the appearance of a Great Sect Master of the martial dao, not only the Tianyang Sword Sect, but other immortal sects may not be able to sit still."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"From now on, the Gunjian Prefecture will not interfere with any matters regarding the Gu Family Manor. We shall simply observe the developments!"</p><p></p><p>As Taishi Yi spoke the last words, his expression turned cold and stern.</p><p></p><p>This was no longer just about the conflicts in Qingyun State. On a larger scale, it had involved the rivalry between the martial dao and the occult arts.</p><p></p><p>Since ancient times, why have there been so few grand masters in the world? It is not only because it is extremely difficult to break through to that level, but also because once a grand master emerges, they often vanish without a trace.</p><p></p><p>While others may not be aware of the reasons, as the Prefect, Taishi Yi had some inkling of the information.</p><p></p><p>The majority of grand masters who have emerged have ended up disappearing, and it is all related to those immortal ancestral sects.</p><p></p><p>Now, a grand master has arisen from Guangyang Prefecture. This will inevitably draw the attention of the entire world.</p><p></p><p>Even the Central Plains region might turn their gaze towards Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The future of Guangyang Prefecture is bound to become a muddied water, and Taishi Yi naturally did not wish to get involved in it.</p><p></p><p>"Now, let's see if that person can sweep away all obstacles!"</p><p></p><p>"If they can truly break free from the shackles that have bound previous grand masters, perhaps a true dragon will emerge from Guangyang Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>Taishi Yi's expression gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Although the chances of that happening were slim, it did not matter to him.</p><p></p><p>As long as he did not get involved, let the other factions break their heads against each other - it would not affect him.</p><p></p><p>At the Crimson Yang Sect, the atmosphere in the main hall was now deathly silent.</p><p></p><p>Sect Master Ouyang Lie listened to the report from his subordinates, and his expression darkened unusually, without uttering a word.</p><p></p><p>Some of the other elders were filled with trepidation and disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The death of the Divine Martial King Pei Jing, and the fall of the three Fusion Realm Elders of the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect - either of these news alone would have shaken Guangyang Prefecture, but the two together were beyond description.</p><p></p><p>Panic! Unease! These were the emotions running through the minds of the Crimson Yang Sect's elders.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Crimson Yang Sect had no small amount of conflict and opposition with the Gu Family Manor. In the past, they had not taken the Gu Family Manor too seriously.</p><p></p><p>However, ever since Gu Qingfeng's annihilation of the Divine Fist Sect and the slaying of a Xiantian Sect Master from the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect, the Crimson Yang Sect had grown wary of them.</p><p></p><p>But even that would have been manageable. With the Crimson Yang Sect's foundations, they could have withstood the pressure from a top-tier True Meaning Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>However, a grand master - that was a different story.</p><p></p><p>A Fusion Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Yang Sect had never possessed such a powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>Considering the enmity between the Crimson Yang Sect and the Gu Family Manor, if that Hegemon Saber were to arrive, the Crimson Yang Sect might be reduced to ashes in an instant.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Ouyang Lie slowly spoke, "The Gu Family Manor has produced a grand master, which has indeed caught us off guard. However, the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect will likely not let this matter rest.</p><p></p><p>For now, the Crimson Yang Sect shall not provoke any conflicts with the Gu Family Manor. We shall quietly wait for the right opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"But if the Gu Family Manor were to attack us, how should we respond?" asked Guxin.</p><p></p><p>At these words, Ouyang Lie's expression stiffened slightly, and he shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"If the Gu Family Manor truly wishes to attack us, then the Crimson Yang Sect can only abandon our holdings in Guangyang Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>This was a humiliating admission, but the reality was just as he said. If a grand master were to target the Crimson Yang Sect, they would have no choice but to retreat from Guangyang Prefecture. To stay would be a path to certain death.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

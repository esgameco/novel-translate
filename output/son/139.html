        <h1>Chapter 139</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Inside the Qingjiang Prefecture, when the Prefect Taishi Yi heard this news, his face changed drastically, and the previous calm demeanor had completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>There was no way around it.</p><p></p><p>This news was simply too astonishing.</p><p></p><p>Taishi Yi was well aware of Pei Jing's strength.</p><p></p><p>In these past few years, Pei Jing had been constantly attacking the Taishan Prefecture, and as the Prefect, Taishi Yi had engaged him in battle numerous times.</p><p></p><p>Even though Taishi Yi did not believe Pei Jing had the potential to dominate the world, his strength was undeniable.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that Pei Jing himself was a Xiantian Sect Master, and he had the backing of the Tianyang Sword Sect, the hegemon of the Qinyun State.</p><p></p><p>Such a force was truly formidable, even by the standards of the Qinyun State.</p><p></p><p>When Taishi Yi learned that Pei Jing was going to make a move against the Baishi Dao, he had made preparations to intervene at a critical moment and bring the Gu Family Village into his own camp.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the Taishan Prefecture would have a top-tier True Meaning Sect Master to defend against Pei Jing's Divine Might Army, thereby increasing their chances of prevailing in the decisive battle among the Central Plains' warlords.</p><p></p><p>However, before Taishi Yi could even make a move, shocking news came from the Baishi Dao - the Divine Might King Pei Jing had been killed.</p><p></p><p>This completely caught Taishi Yi off guard.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, one of the subordinates knelt and reported, "Not only has the Divine Might King Pei Jing been killed, but three Fusion Realm Elders of the Tianyang Sword Sect have also fallen at the hands of Gu Qingfeng."</p><p></p><p>"According to the information, that Hegemon Saber is not just a True Meaning Sect Master, but a Great Sect Master of this era!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the entire Prefectural Office was shaken.</p><p></p><p>Great Sect Master!</p><p></p><p>These three simple words carried an indescribable weight.</p><p></p><p>Everyone, including Taishi Yi, could not help but widen their eyes in disbelief, as if they had heard something unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Taishi Yi muttered to himself, "A Great Sect Master... It's been so many years, and I never thought the Taishan Prefecture would produce a Great Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Pei Jing was defeated and killed, and no wonder the Gu Family Village was not afraid of the Tianyang Sword Sect - it turns out that Hegemon Saber is a Great Sect Master of this era."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all of Taishi Yi's doubts had been resolved, and everything had become clear before him.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Qingfeng was a Great Sect Master, then everything could be explained.</p><p></p><p>Why the Gu Family Village was not afraid of the Tianyang Sword Sect.</p><p>Why the Divine Might King Pei Jing was defeated and killed.</p><p></p><p>It was all because that Hegemon Saber was a rare Great Sect Master of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Although the world often says that sorcerers are superior to martial artists, that only applies to ordinary martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Once a martial artist reaches the realm of a Great Sect Master, they cannot be compared to the past.</p><p></p><p>The value of a Great Sect Master in the martial dao is self-evident.</p><p></p><p>At this time, someone spoke up with a grave expression, "The fall of several Fusion Realm Elders, and even the collapse of Pei Jing whom they supported, the Tianyang Sword Sect is bound to be furious."</p><p></p><p>If it were just the loss of Fusion Realm Elders, it might have been bearable, but Pei Jing was a figure the Tianyang Sword Sect had cultivated for over twenty years, hoping to use him to contend for the domination of the world.</p><p></p><p>Now that Pei Jing had been killed, their plans had been shattered. It was undoubtedly difficult for them to accept.</p><p></p><p>Taishi Yi's gaze was deep and he said indifferently, "The events that follow will no longer be something we can interfere with."</p><p></p><p>"In the current chaotic world, it is ultimately the era of the sorcerers."</p><p></p><p>"With the appearance of a Great Sect Master of the martial dao, not only the Tianyang Sword Sect, but other immortal sects may also find it difficult to remain seated."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"From now on, the Junshui Prefecture will not interfere with any of the affairs of the Gu Family Manor. We shall simply observe the developments!"</p><p></p><p>As Taishi Yi said these final words, his expression turned cold and stern.</p><p></p><p>This matter no longer just involves the conflicts in Qingyun State, but on a larger scale, it has even touched upon the rivalry between the martial dao and the sorcerer's path.</p><p></p><p>Since ancient times, why have true grand masters been so rare in the world?</p><p></p><p>It is not only because it is extremely difficult for them to break through, but also because once a true grand master emerges, they often quickly disappear from the public eye.</p><p></p><p>While others may not be aware of the reasons, as the Prefect, Taishi Yi has a vague understanding of certain information.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of grand masters who have emerged have ended up disappearing, and this is all related to those immortal ancestral sects and schools.</p><p></p><p>Now, a grand master has emerged from Guangyang Prefecture, which will inevitably draw the attention of the entire world.</p><p></p><p>Even the Central Plains region might turn their gaze towards Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The future of Guangyang Prefecture is bound to become a muddied situation, and Taishi Yi naturally does not wish to get involved in it.</p><p></p><p>"Now, we can only wait and see if that individual can sweep away all obstacles!"</p><p></p><p>"If they can truly break free from the shackles that have constrained previous grand masters, perhaps a true dragon might emerge from Guangyang Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>Taishi Yi's expression gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Although the probability of this happening is small, so be it.</p><p></p><p>As long as he does not get involved, let the other factions break their heads against each other, it will not affect him.</p><p></p><p>â€”</p><p></p><p>At the Crimson Yang Sect, the atmosphere within the main hall is now deathly silent.</p><p></p><p>Sect Master Ouyang Lie listens to the report from his subordinates, and his expression turns unusually gloomy, without uttering a single word.</p><p></p><p>Some of the other elders are filled with trepidation and disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The death of the Divine Martial King Pei Jing, and the fall of the three Fusion Realm Elders of the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect - either of these news alone would be enough to shake Guangyang Prefecture, but the two combined are beyond description.</p><p></p><p>Panic! Unease! These are the emotions and thoughts of many of the Crimson Flame Sect's elders.</p><p></p><p>After all, to be precise, the Crimson Flame Sect has no small amount of conflict and opposition with the Gu Family Manor. In the past, the Crimson Flame Sect did not pay much attention to the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>But ever since Gu Qingfeng annihilated the Divine Fist Sect and slew a Xiantian Sect Master of the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect, the Crimson Flame Sect has been filled with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>However, if it were just that, it would still be manageable.</p><p></p><p>With the Crimson Flame Sect's foundations, even if they cannot match a peak True Meaning Sect Master, they can still withstand the pressure.</p><p></p><p>But a grand master - that is a different matter entirely.</p><p></p><p>Fusion Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Sect has never possessed such individuals.</p><p></p><p>Considering the enmity between the Crimson Flame Sect and the Gu Family Manor, if that Peerless Saber were to arrive, the Crimson Flame Sect might be reduced to ashes in an instant.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Ouyang Lie slowly spoke, "The fact that the Gu Family Manor has produced a grand master is indeed beyond our expectations. However, the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect will likely not let this matter rest.</p><p></p><p>For now, the Crimson Flame Sect shall not provoke any conflicts with the Gu Family Manor. We shall quietly wait for the right opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"But if the Gu Family Manor were to make a move against us, how should we respond?" Gu Xin asked.</p><p></p><p>These words caused Ouyang Lie's expression to stiffen momentarily, before he shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"If the Gu Family Manor truly decides to attack us, then the Crimson Flame Sect can only abandon our holdings in Guangyang Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>This statement was somewhat embarrassing to make, but the reality is as such.</p><p></p><p>If a grand master were to target the Crimson Flame Sect, then the only choice for the Crimson Flame Sect is to leave Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>If they do not leave, it would be a path to certain death.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

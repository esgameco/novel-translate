        <h1>Chapter 168</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This is our opportunity!" </p><p></p><p>"I have decided to dispatch troops to the prefectures of Yixing, Datong, Danxia, and Huaining starting today," Gu Yang said coldly to the people present.</p><p></p><p>Dispatching troops to four prefectures!</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, the crowd was filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>If this had happened before the fall of the ancient Yuetian, Gu Yang directly dispatching troops to four prefectures would not have excited them so much.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Yang currently only had a solid foothold in one prefecture. Even with some foundation, rashly going to war with four prefectures might not bring much benefit.</p><p></p><p>If he failed, it could lead to the ruin of his entire enterprise.</p><p></p><p>But the situation is different now.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's single sword strike killed the ancient Yuetian, and the reputation of the Hegemon Sword has suppressed the world. Gu Yang is not only the Prince of Guangyang, but also the current lord of the Gu family manor, backed by an unparalleled powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>In this case, when the Guangyang army enters the four prefectures, how much resistance could they possibly face? After all, a person's name casts a long shadow. The mere mention of the Hegemon Sword is enough to deter any thoughts of rebellion.</p><p></p><p>Now that Gu Yang is dispatching troops, he intends to use the momentum to crush them. The probability of success is naturally much higher than ordinary.</p><p></p><p>While the crowd was lost in thought, Gu Yang turned to three of the generals.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Zhen!"</p><p></p><p>"At your service!"</p><p></p><p>"You will lead an army of 150,000 to attack Yixing Prefecture. I will send three Sect Masters to accompany your troops. You must capture Yixing Prefecture as quickly as possible, without any mistakes!"</p><p></p><p>"I will carry out your orders!"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged general solemnly accepted the command, his expression filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Next, Gu Yang looked at the other two.</p><p></p><p>"Xue Cheng, you will also lead an army of 150,000 to Datong Prefecture. Jiang Mo, you will lead 150,000 troops to Danxia Prefecture. As for Huaining Prefecture, I will personally handle it!"</p><p></p><p>"We will obey your orders!" The two men replied in unison, fists clenched in salute.</p><p></p><p>"Since there are no objections, then move out immediately!" Gu Yang waved his hand, and all the generals respectfully withdrew.</p><p></p><p>The once crowded hall was now left mostly empty.</p><p></p><p>Dispatching troops to four prefectures!</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang is taking a risk with this move. The Guangyang army he currently controls numbers less than 700,000 in total. Deploying 600,000 troops to attack the four prefectures, the remaining forces left to defend Guangyang Prefecture would only be a few tens of thousands.</p><p></p><p>Defending a prefecture with just a few tens of thousands of troops is almost like a paper tiger.</p><p></p><p>Normally, Gu Yang would not dare to take such a risk. After all, Guangyang Prefecture is his true foundation. If problems arise there, even if he conquers the other prefectures, it would be a pyrrhic victory.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the military strength of a single prefecture is formidable. Dreaming of suppressing a prefecture with just 150,000 troops is wishful thinking. When Pei Jing attacked and crushed the resistance of Guangyang Prefecture, he had to mobilize tens of thousands of troops to succeed.</p><p></p><p>However, the current situation is different.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Yuetian has just been killed, and the Guangyang army's reputation has soared. Now that they are marching on the four prefectures, who would dare to directly resist them?</p><p></p><p>An unparalleled expert surpassing Great Sect Masters is like an insurmountable mountain to others.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Yang intends to seize this opportunity to bring the entire Taishan Commandery under his control as quickly as possible.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Provinces have thirty-six commanderies. The Azure Cloud Province has four commanderies. </p><p></p><p>Only by establishing a foothold in one commandery can he plan to dominate an entire province, and then compete for the entire world.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Yang looked at Gu Yun beside him.</p><p></p><p>"The Shenwu Sect has many powerful experts..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty the King of Guangyang, I wonder if the Patriarch of the Ancient Sect can convey a message to the Wuzhou side and mobilize a portion of the sect's forces to assist Your Majesty in conquering the Taishan Prefecture?"</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty the King of Guangyang, I have no objections." </p><p></p><p>Gu Yun nodded.</p><p></p><p>Since he had already decided to ally with this person, there was nothing left to hesitate about.</p><p></p><p>Or rather,</p><p></p><p>After witnessing Gu Qingfeng's terrifying abilities and the profound mysteries of the Longevity Sutra, Gu Yun no longer had any other thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He considered himself a disciple in front of Gu Qingfeng, and the King of Guangyang before him was Gu Qingfeng's offspring. From any perspective, Gu Yun had no reason to refuse.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Gu Yun agreed,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang also revealed a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Good, with the assistance of the Divine Martial Sect, I will be as powerful as a tiger with wings!"</p><p></p><p>"For this attack on Huaining Prefecture, I also need the aid of the Patriarch of the Ancient Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty the King can rest assured, I will provide full support!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was also very satisfied with this response.</p><p></p><p>If external forces were not needed, that would be overconfidence.</p><p></p><p>Although he had eleven Transcendent Sect Masters under his command, ordinary Transcendent Sect Masters were no match for the powerful Patriarch of the Divine Martial Sect before him.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Yun appeared humble and submissive in front of Gu Qingfeng, acting like a junior disciple, Gu Yang was well aware that he was not as simple as he seemed on the surface.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Martial Sect had suppressed Wuzhou for many years, and in the current declining state of the martial arts world where sorcerers were revered, the Divine Martial Sect was still able to maintain its position, with a sense of being above the mundane.</p><p></p><p>As the Patriarch, if Gu Yun did not possess considerable strength, he would not have been able to reach this position.</p><p></p><p>Half-step Grand Sect Master! In the current absence of any Grand Sect Masters in the martial arts world, this level of strength could be considered the number one in the martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>The current number one in the martial arts was not Gu Yun, but his own father.</p><p></p><p>But regardless, Gu Yang was well aware that although Gu Yun might not yet reach the level of the number one, he could easily rank among the top three, if not the top two.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>If Gu Yun could personally take action, it would save a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>The next day,</p><p></p><p>The army set out.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Yang at the helm, the sixty-thousand-strong army divided into four routes and headed directly towards the Four Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>As soon as this news was out,</p><p></p><p>It quickly reached the ears of the Four Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>When the prefectural administrators and imperial military leaders heard this news, their expressions changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Everyone now knew that the Guangyang Army was the most formidable force in the Taishan Prefecture. Although they only had sixty thousand troops, the figure behind the King of Guangyang was a single person who could match the strength of a million-strong army.</p><p></p><p>Now,</p><p></p><p>With Gu Yang leading the army, the imperial forces had already lost their morale.</p><p></p><p>Resistance?</p><p></p><p>It was nothing but a joke!</p><p></p><p>Even if they could hold off a hundred and fifty thousand troops, they could not withstand the methods of that Hegemon Saber.</p><p></p><p>If that person were to personally take action, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>When the Guangyang Army entered the Four Prefectures, many cities surrendered without any resistance. The level of smoothness surprised even Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>He had expected some resistance from Huaining Prefecture, but he never imagined that Huaining Prefecture would not put up any resistance at all, and everything would be so effortless.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Yang was about to take control of the entire Huaining Prefecture, there were still a few imperial armies that refused to surrender and vowed to block his entry into Huaining Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>For this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang would not show any mercy.</p><p></p><p>He personally led the army, and had Gu Yun accompany him in taking action. In just a few days, they completely crushed that force.</p><p></p><p>At this point,</p><p></p><p>Huaining Prefecture had fallen into his hands.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

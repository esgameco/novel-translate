        <h1>Chapter 58</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Inside the grand hall of the Qingyang Sect, Gu Qingfeng sat on the throne reserved for the sect master. His mind was focused on the item list, and with a single thought, a secret manual appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Extraordinary martial arts!</p><p>The Heavenly Dipper Divine Body!</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not hesitate and immediately opened the secret manual.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the secret manual transformed into a stream of light and disappeared into his mind.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, numerous memories surfaced in Gu Qingfeng's mind, as if he had cultivated the Heavenly Dipper Divine Body for many years. The twelve layers of the Heavenly Dipper Divine Body were all revealed.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, the Heavenly Dipper Divine Body is the advanced and ultimate technique of the Heavenly Dipper Invincible Body. However, the two are not like the Chaos Iron Cloth and the Hundred Refinements Golden Body, where the former is a part of the latter.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when Gu Qingfeng practiced the Heavenly Dipper Divine Body, the Heavenly Dipper Invincible Body did not disappear.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Gu Qingfeng's qi and blood were stirred, and the aura around him visibly surged.</p><p></p><p>Washing Marrow Middle Stage!</p><p>Washing Marrow Late Stage!</p><p>Washing Marrow Perfection!</p><p></p><p>In less than a few breaths, Gu Qingfeng's cultivation had risen all the way to the Washing Marrow Perfection realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Qingfeng looked at his attribute panel and saw that a new martial art, the Heavenly Dipper Divine Body, had been added to the list.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p>Heavenly Dipper Divine Body (Twelve-layered Perfected Protective Qi, Level 9)</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Afterward, Gu Qingfeng tried to activate the protective qi, and he saw almost tangible qi emerge from his body, which was several times stronger than the protective qi of the Heavenly Dipper Invincible Body.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the power of the protective qi, Gu Qingfeng's eyes gleamed with delight.</p><p></p><p>"With this level of protective qi, even if I were to stand still, the Qingyang Patriarch would have difficulty breaking through my defenses."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the protective qi derived from the perfected Heavenly Dipper Divine Body was exceptionally powerful.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, Gu Qingfeng calmed his mind and looked at the Heavenly Dipper Divine Body on his attribute panel again.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Dipper Divine Body's twelve-layered perfection can reach the peak of the Washing Marrow realm. If I were to break through its limit, I would be able to directly advance to the Refining Viscera realm!"</p><p></p><p>Refining Viscera! This was the pinnacle of the realm below the Innate.</p><p></p><p>This extermination of the Qingyang Sect had made Gu Qingfeng truly realize that in the current chaotic world, there were many powerful experts, and the strength of the Washing Marrow realm, although not weak, might not be that formidable.</p><p></p><p>Just to deal with the Qingyang Patriarch, he had to exert his full strength. If he were to face an opponent stronger than the Qingyang Patriarch, Gu Qingfeng was not confident in his ability to contend.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Qingyang Sect was just one of the sects in the Guangyang Prefecture. Who knows what other powerful existences might be lurking within the Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, once the news of the Qingyang Sect's destruction spread, it would undoubtedly shake the Guangyang Prefecture. At that time, the Gu family would inevitably come into the sight of the major powers.</p><p></p><p>This was different from their small plot of land in the White Stone Dao. Once they reached that stage, the Gu family must have sufficient strength to support themselves.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, if he could break through to the Refining Viscera realm, many problems could be alleviated.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Breakthrough!"</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Gu Qingfeng directly spent 40 Improvement Points to break through the limit of the Heavenly Dipper Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a flood of memories surged forth. In these memories, Gu Qingfeng had spent years cultivating the perfected Heavenly Dipper Divine Body, struggling to break through, and later traveled the world, competing with many powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The End.</p><p></p><p>Before his final passing, he finally attained enlightenment, breaking through the limits of the Heavenly Canopy Divine Body and entering a brand-new realm.</p><p></p><p>Memories spanning decades.</p><p></p><p>Yet, to the outside world, it was but a moment.</p><p></p><p>Within his physical body, the vital energy and strength surged back into his heart. The previously faint heartbeat had completely vanished, leaving Gu Qingfeng's entire being in a deathly stillness.</p><p></p><p>After a long while.</p><p></p><p>The missing heartbeat reappeared.</p><p></p><p>Thump! Thump!!</p><p></p><p>The violent heartbeat thundered like the beating of a great drum.</p><p></p><p>A vast amount of the purest vital energy and strength flowed out from his heart, instantly permeating every inch of Gu Qingfeng's body.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>An even more terrifying vitality force revived, the horrifying blood energy bursting forth and enveloping the entire grand hall.</p><p></p><p>After some time.</p><p></p><p>The blood energy gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sat upright, once again looking at his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng   Age: 36/200   Realm: Refining the Viscera First Realm</p><p></p><p>Martial Arts: Gu Family Fist (Unbreakable Level 1), Iron Body Technique (Iron Body Level 1), Great Tombstone Throw (Proficient), Iron Leg Technique (Perfected), Refining Iron Finger (Proficient), Scorching Sun Divine Palm (Perfected Ninth Layer Scorching Sun Palm Strength Level 4), Heaven Thunder Sword Technique (Beginner), Hundred Temperings Golden Body (Unbreakable Golden Body Level 9), Seven Killing Blade Art (Not Learned), Heavenly Canopy Invincible Body (Perfected Ninth Layer Protective Canopy Qi Level 4), Heavenly Canopy Divine Body (Indestructible Divine Body Level 1)   Upgrade Points: 60...</p><p></p><p>"The First Realm of Refining the Viscera!"</p><p></p><p>"Lifespan of two hundred!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes shone with brilliance.</p><p></p><p>The Refining the Viscera realm is different from other realms, as it does not have the distinctions of initial, intermediate, and advanced stages, but rather five distinct realms.</p><p></p><p>Refining the Viscera has five realms, and one can advance to the next realm upon successfully refining each vital organ.</p><p></p><p>If all five vital organs are refined to perfection, the cultivator can then break through to the Patriarch realm.</p><p></p><p>At the moment.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has succeeded in refining his heart, thus entering the First Realm of Refining the Viscera.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Even the First Realm of Refining the Viscera is not on par with the Marrow Cleansing realm.</p><p></p><p>If his breakthrough to the Perfected Marrow Cleansing realm had increased his strength several times compared to the initial Marrow Cleansing realm, then his current breakthrough to the First Realm of Refining the Viscera has completely crushed his previous Perfected Marrow Cleansing realm.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength.</p><p></p><p>If the Patriarch of the Azure Yang were to be reborn.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng is absolutely confident that he could subdue the other in a single encounter.</p><p></p><p>This.</p><p></p><p>Is the power of the Refining the Viscera realm.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Canopy Divine Body has broken through its limits, and the Ninth Layer Protective Canopy Qi has advanced to the Indestructible Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>At this stage.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng no longer needs to consciously activate his protective Qi and blood energy, as his physical body's defense is now maintained at a true peak state.</p><p></p><p>The Indestructible Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>It is the refinement of his physique.</p><p></p><p>"With my current defensive power, even if I were to just stand still, I doubt anyone below the Refining the Viscera realm would be able to harm me!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng mused inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering this realm, Gu Qingfeng's sense of security has greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>Although he is unsure of how many Refining the Viscera cultivators there are in the Guangyang Prefecture, or even the entire Azure Cloud State, Gu Qingfeng can be certain that the number of Refining the Viscera cultivators is not high.</p><p></p><p>As for the Patriarch-level experts above the Refining the Viscera realm, their numbers would be even fewer.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Patriarch of the Azure Yang's strength is estimated to be at most the initial Marrow Cleansing realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the First Realm of Refining the Viscera, Gu Qingfeng believes that even if someone were to target the Gu Family, they would have to carefully consider whether they have the qualifications to do so.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang entered the grand hall from the outside, his body exuding a strong scent of bloodshed, indicating that he had just been through a fierce battle.</p><p></p><p>"Father, we have discovered a most unusual place!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

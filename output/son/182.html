        <h1>Chapter 182</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After all, Ancient Emperor Gu Yetian had fallen in Guangyang Prefecture, but the Tian Yang Sword Sect had not been extinguished, and Gu Yang still felt like there was a bone stuck in his throat.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Yang Sword Sect did not perish.</p><p></p><p>He was uneasy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Now.</p><p></p><p>Mobilize troops to Nanyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's purpose was very simple, which was to use this opportunity to eliminate the Tian Yang Sword Sect, allowing this immortal sect to completely dissipate.</p><p></p><p>The others heard this and had no objections.</p><p></p><p>With the fall of Ancient Emperor Gu, the awe-inspiring pressure of the immortal sects was no longer significant in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Moreover.</p><p></p><p>To eliminate the immortal sect.</p><p></p><p>Such an achievement would be enough to boast about for a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>After hearing Gu Yang's words, everyone in their hearts agreed.</p><p></p><p>Only Gu Yun said in a deep voice: "The King's mobilization of troops to Nanyang Prefecture is indeed without problem, but the Tian Yang Sword Sect is after all an immortal sect, with profound foundations. This time the mobilization to Nanyang Prefecture, the Tian Yang Sword Sect will not just sit and wait to die."</p><p></p><p>"When Ancient Emperor Gu was alive, the Tian Yang Sword Sect could not even stir up any waves, and now that Ancient Emperor Gu is dead, why should I, the King, fear the Tian Yang Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang sneered.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>He then looked at Gu Yun and said, "The Shen Wu Sect is the number one sect in the world, and I believe its foundations are not weak. Now, dealing with a half-crippled Tian Yang Sword Sect should not be a problem, right?"</p><p></p><p>If a declaration of war is made against the Tian Yang Sword Sect, then the Shen Wu Sect would be the most crucial main force.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun smiled confidently: "This matter, Your Majesty can rest assured. When Ancient Emperor Gu was alive, our Shen Wu Sect could not do anything to the Tian Yang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>But now that Ancient Emperor Gu is dead, as long as the Tian Yang Sword Sect does not have a second Transformation Realm expert emerge, our Shen Wu Sect is sufficient to suppress it.</p><p></p><p>The previous reminder was just to let Your Majesty be a little more careful, lest the Tian Yang Sword Sect, in its desperation, take any unfavorable actions against Your Majesty."</p><p></p><p>"I, the King, will personally pay attention to this matter."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression also became a bit more serious, but he was not too worried about this problem in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It's simple.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the several sect master-level experts currently arriving from the Shen Wu Sect, among whom there are even Profound Meaning Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Yang's view, the power of the Shadow Guards alone is enough.</p><p></p><p>After all.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guards have eleven Transcendent Realm experts, and they are all at the peak Transcendent Realm level, so their strength can be imagined.</p><p></p><p>As long as it is not a Transformation Realm expert taking action, the strength of the Shadow Guards is sufficient to resist.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary.</p><p></p><p>If a Transformation Realm expert personally arrives, even if one is cautious, it would be useless.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang then conveyed some orders, asking the various generals to go and prepare, and then summoned Gu Yi.</p><p></p><p>"You go back and tell your father that the King will soon lead a large army to attack Nanyang Prefecture and eliminate the Tian Yang Sword Sect, but I'm worried that the Tian Yang Sword Sect has some foundations, so I hope to borrow the Demon-Slaying Saber for use!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said.</p><p></p><p>Although he was not afraid of the Tian Yang Sword Sect in his heart, he still made the appropriate preparations for the sake of safety.</p><p></p><p>At least secretly asking Gu Qingfeng for help, Gu Yang did not feel ashamed.</p><p></p><p>After all, in front of Gu Qingfeng, Gu Yang has never regarded himself as the King of Guangyang.</p><p></p><p>When the son has trouble,</p><p></p><p>Seeking help from his own father is perfectly normal.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi immediately accepted the order and withdrew, then galloped quickly towards the Gu family manor.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has made progress in his cultivation with the guidance of the Shen Wu Sect experts!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has made some gains in cultivating the Longevity Sutra, and his cultivation has improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has gained some insights in cultivating the Tyrannical Saber Slash, and his Tyrannical Saber Dao has broken through to the fifth level!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring..."</p><p></p><p>In the Whetstone Hall,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was cultivating as usual, occasionally glancing at the changes on the information panel.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After he created the Longevity Sutra's Marrow Cleansing Technique, he directly handed down this martial art to Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>In fact, not only Gu Yang. </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also took the Longevity Sutra as the foundational cultivation method for all the current Shadow Guards.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guards number three thousand one hundred people.</p><p></p><p>But over the years, there have been quite a few casualties.</p><p></p><p>Up to now, including the three thousand Shadow Guards training in the outer hall, the total number of Shadow Guards is three thousand and seventy-six people.</p><p></p><p>Twenty-four people have perished.</p><p></p><p>Among these twenty-four people, twenty have reached the Marrow Cleansing Realm, four have reached the Refining Impurities Realm, and there were no losses among the Grandmaster realm experts.</p><p></p><p>After all, this is normal.</p><p></p><p>In the current world, it is not easy to slay a Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the Shadow Guards under Gu Yang monitor various factions, and even some top powers have Shadow Guards planted within, so some losses are only to be expected.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Qingfeng is now doing his best to enhance the strength of the Shadow Guards.</p><p></p><p>The Longevity Sutra, as a cultivation method that can perfectly refine the body, is the most suitable as the foundational technique for the Shadow Guards.</p><p></p><p>Shadow Guard cultivators who practice this supreme technique possess unparalleled strength within their realm, and can even easily fight against those of higher realms.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Gu Qingfeng has also passed down four Grandmaster-level supreme arts to the Shadow Guards: the Prajna Sutra, the Pure Yang True Classic, the Tyrannical Saber Slash, and the Sun and Moon Fist Classic.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the original Seven Slaughter Saber Technique and the Crimson Flame Divine Skill, these seven supreme arts are the standard cultivation for the Shadow Guards.</p><p></p><p>For those below the Grandmaster realm, they cultivate the Longevity Sutra and the Crimson Flame Divine Skill.</p><p></p><p>The experts who have reached the Refining Impurities Realm and broken through to the Grandmaster realm cultivate the Prajna Sutra and the Pure Yang True Body.</p><p></p><p>Especially the latter, which can allow one to cultivate the Qi and Blood Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>They also cultivate the Three Supreme Arts: the Seven Slaughter Saber Technique, the Tyrannical Saber Slash, and the Sun and Moon Fist Classic.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, the martial arts of the Shadow Guards can be considered fully armed to the teeth.</p><p></p><p>As for the ordinary martial arts, it's fine. But for the Grandmaster-level supreme arts, as well as the Longevity Sutra which involves perfect body refinement, Gu Qingfeng has no intention of revealing them for now.</p><p></p><p>He has not even passed them down to the outer hall and some inner hall disciples.</p><p></p><p>It's very simple - the time is not yet right.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng has no reservations about the Shadow Guards.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Shadow Guards are absolutely loyal to him, and there is no possibility of betrayal.</p><p></p><p>"Once the Refining Impurities Technique of the Longevity Sutra is fully developed, this supreme martial art will be complete. At that time, the situation of the Sorcerer controlling the world can truly be overturned."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's mind was calm.</p><p></p><p>The Marrow Cleansing Technique has already been created, so how far can the Refining Impurities Technique be? </p><p></p><p>With a supreme art of a commandery in his hands, and numerous martial arts involving the Refining Impurities realm, as long as he is given time, Gu Qingfeng believes that creating the Refining Impurities Technique will not be a big problem.</p><p></p><p>While Gu Qingfeng was in seclusion, two days later, Gu Yi arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Your subordinate pays respects to the Esteemed One!"</p><p></p><p>In the Whetstone Hall, Gu Qingfeng looked at him with a calm gaze and slowly said, "Speak, what is the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"The King wishes to attack Nanyang Commandery and eliminate the Tianyang Sword Sect, but is worried that the Tianyang Sword Sect may have backup plans, so he has sent me to humbly request the Esteemed One to bestow the Exorcising Saber, to deal with the Tianyang Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Qingfeng couldn't help but laugh: "I thought that after becoming the King of Guangyang, he would be more arrogant, but unexpectedly, he is now more cautious!"</p><p></p><p>(Chapter ends)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 126</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Reward Upgrade Points *10!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has made a breakthrough in his cultivation, and his strength has steadily increased!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has secretly expanded his military forces, and his influence has increased!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has angered the Green Forest forces by eliminating too many mountain strongholds!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by post-Bone Refining realm cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain a mid-stage Bone Refining realm cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain 5 late-stage Blood Refining realm cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has broken through to the Skin Refining Realm Perfection!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward Upgrade Points *10!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Shengnan' has cleansed his root foundation, and his talent has slightly improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has attained a sudden enlightenment in battle and has stepped into the Blood Refining Realm Perfection!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward Upgrade Points *50!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward 100 Bone Refining Pills!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward 100 Marrow Cleansing Pills!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward the Peerless Martial Art 'Wind and Thunder Blade Technique' at the Perfection Level!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Over the past month.</p><p></p><p>The messages on the information panel have been constantly updating, and Gu Qingfeng would take a look whenever he had the time.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>When he saw Gu Yang's breakthrough, a smile finally appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Refining Realm Perfection!"</p><p></p><p>"Now it's finally time for my breakthrough!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu's breakthroughs provided some upgrade points, which was enough. And then came Gu Yang's breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>In other words.</p><p></p><p>The three of them breaking through.</p><p></p><p>A total of 70 upgrade points, which is a considerable amount of room for operation.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had a thought and took out the Wind and Thunder Blade Technique.</p><p></p><p>The moment he opened the secret manual, streams of light flowed into his mind, and it was as if he had practiced the Wind and Thunder Blade Technique for many years, with all the memories deeply etched in his mind.</p><p></p><p>After a long while.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>Then.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Wind and Thunder Blade Technique (Perfection, Wind and Thunder Blade Intent Lv.3)!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Wind and Thunder Blade Intent Lv.3!"</p><p></p><p>A cold glint flashed in Gu Qingfeng's eyes, and it seemed that a terrifying true intent in the form of thunder was emanating from between his brows. Even the divine weapons in the vast Whetstone Hall trembled slightly, as if they had sensed something.</p><p></p><p>The Zhu Xie Blade in the center let out a faint hum, and a powerful aura was also emanating from it.</p><p></p><p>Peerless Martial Art!</p><p>True Intent Lv.3!</p><p></p><p>"The Qi Killing Blade Technique at the Perfection level only allows one to comprehend the first level of Killing Intent, and then break through to the second level of Killing Intent.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Wind and Thunder Blade Technique at the Perfection level has only allowed me to possess the third level of Wind and Thunder Blade Intent."</p><p></p><p>"This means that the cultivation of True Intent is not as easy as it seems!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Wind and Thunder Blade Technique is among the top-tier Peerless Martial Arts, and only by reaching its Perfection level can one attain the third level of True Intent.</p><p></p><p>This shows.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty of breaking through True Intent is immense.</p><p></p><p>Only by reaching the sixth level of True Intent can one be considered to have entered the Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>Up to this point.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has mastered three major True Intents.</p><p></p><p>Killing Intent Lv.2! Wind and Thunder Blade Intent Lv.3!</p><p>Tyrant Blade Intent Lv.8!</p><p></p><p>It's worth mentioning that all three True Intents are related to blade techniques, which brings great benefits.</p><p></p><p>When the accumulation of blade technique True Intents is sufficient, Gu Qingfeng can directly use this opportunity to refine and promote the Tyrant Blade Intent, allowing it to break through further.</p><p></p><p>Until now.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has been contemplating the Tyrant Blade Intent, but he has still not been able to make it reach Perfection and break through to the ninth level of True Intent.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng turned his gaze back to other areas of the attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>What he truly needs to improve now are not many, mainly the Prajnaparamita Sutra and the Scarlet Flame Divine Skill, and then the Tyrant Blade Technique.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's thoughts stirred slightly as he tried to break through the Crimson Flame Divine Art.</p><p></p><p>"Breakthrough the Crimson Flame Divine Art!"</p><p></p><p>"It requires 50 points to upgrade."</p><p></p><p>Perceiving the information in his mind, Gu Qingfeng understood.</p><p></p><p>As expected.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Divine Art was not a transcendent martial art, but a true master-level martial art.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, this upgrade would not have been a regular breakthrough, but a direct limit-breaking upgrade.</p><p></p><p>Howeverâ€”</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng saw that upgrading a master-level martial art required 50 upgrade points, his heart trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Fifty upgrade points.</p><p></p><p>That was not a small amount.</p><p></p><p>At least up to this point, Gu Qingfeng would need to accumulate 50 upgrade points, which would take him at least one or two years.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these were only temporary.</p><p></p><p>In the future, when the Gu family's population grows, the speed of obtaining upgrade points will increase greatly.</p><p></p><p>Before that, Gu Qingfeng did not break through the Crimson Flame Divine Art, but instead turned his attention to the Prajna Sutra.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Prajna Sutra has been upgraded to the fourth level of perfection!</p><p>Consumed 10 upgrade points!</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's thoughts stirred, and he directly upgraded the Prajna Sutra to perfection.</p><p></p><p>However, the moment the Prajna Sutra broke through to perfection, Gu Qingfeng felt a tremendously powerful force awakening in his body.</p><p></p><p>Perfect Marrow Cleansing!</p><p></p><p>Without any accidents.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at his own attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>He saw that the moment he achieved Perfect Marrow Cleansing, his lifespan increased by another 400 years.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Gu Qingfeng's lifespan had reached 1,200 years.</p><p></p><p>"1,200 years, who says that the martial dao cannot achieve longevity!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes shone with brilliance.</p><p></p><p>Perfect Marrow Cleansing granted him a lifespan of 1,200 years, which was much stronger than cultivators at the same level.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng understood.</p><p></p><p>From the moment he stepped into the Perfect Martial Dao, the legend that the martial dao cannot achieve longevity has been completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao can achieve longevity!</p><p></p><p>As long as the physical body is pure and perfect, the lifespan can be greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>If Marrow Cleansing is already like this, then in the future when he achieves Perfect Refinement of the Dantian and even becomes a Grand Master, Gu Qingfeng believes that his lifespan will reach a terrifying level.</p><p></p><p>At that time, longevity and immortality may not be an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Gu Qingfeng suppressed the excitement in his heart.</p><p></p><p>For now, the most important thing for Gu Qingfeng is to step into the Perfect Refinement of the Dantian.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the remaining upgrade points, Gu Qingfeng's thoughts stirred, and he directly upgraded the Prajna Sutra to the fifth level.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Prajna Sutra (Fifth Level, Prajna True Body Fourth Grade)!</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When this martial art reached the fifth level, Gu Qingfeng felt that his original heart seemed to undergo a terrifying transformation, and the terrifying vital energy was replenished from it, instantly spreading throughout his body.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the first level of Perfect Refinement of the Dantian!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng closed his eyes and examined his body. He found that his heart now had a different, mysterious quality, and the blood replenished from it was no longer as crimson as before, but had a faint golden hue.</p><p></p><p>Yes, golden!</p><p></p><p>Now Gu Qingfeng found that his blood had become somewhat different. In this golden blood, Gu Qingfeng felt a completely different aura, as if the blood had been endowed with some mysterious power.</p><p></p><p>This change made Gu Qingfeng's brows furrow slightly.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

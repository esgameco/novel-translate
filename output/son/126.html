        <h1>Chapter 126</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Reward Upgrade Points *10!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has cultivated with some insights, and his strength has steadily increased!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has secretly expanded his military forces, and his influence has increased!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has angered the Green Forest forces by eliminating too many mountain strongholds!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by post-Bone Refining realm cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain a mid-stage Bone Refining realm cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain 5 late-stage Blood Refining realm cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has broken through to the Skin Refining Realm Perfection!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward Upgrade Points *10!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Shengnan' has cleansed his root foundation, and his talent has slightly improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has attained a sudden enlightenment in battle, and has stepped into the Blood Refining Realm Perfection!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward Upgrade Points *50!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward 100 Bone Refining Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward 100 Marrow Cleansing Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward the Perfected Tier Excellent Martial Art 'Wind and Thunder Blade Technique'!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Over the past month.</p><p></p><p>The messages on the information panel have been constantly updating, and Gu Qingfeng would take a look whenever he had the time.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>When he saw Gu Yang's breakthrough, a smile finally appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Refining Realm Perfection!"</p><p></p><p>"Now it's finally time for my own breakthrough!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu's breakthroughs provided some upgrade points, which was enough. And then came Gu Yang's breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that.</p><p></p><p>With the three of them breaking through.</p><p></p><p>A total of seventy upgrade points, which is a considerable amount of room for operation.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had a thought and took out the Wind and Thunder Blade Technique.</p><p></p><p>The moment he opened the secret manual, streams of light flowed into his mind, and it was as if he had cultivated the Wind and Thunder Blade Technique for many years, with all the memories deeply etched in his mind.</p><p></p><p>After a long while.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng let out a long breath.</p><p></p><p>Then.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Wind and Thunder Blade Technique (Perfected, Wind and Thunder Blade Intent Lv.3)!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Wind and Thunder Blade Intent Lv.3!"</p><p></p><p>A cold glint flashed in Gu Qingfeng's eyes, and between his brows, a terrifying true intent seemed to have transformed into thunderbolts. Even the divine weapons in the vast Whetstone Hall trembled slightly, as if they had sensed something.</p><p></p><p>The Zhu Xie Blade in the center let out a faint hum, and a powerful aura emanated from it.</p><p></p><p>Excellent Martial Art!</p><p>True Intent Lv.3!</p><p></p><p>"For the top-tier martial art Qi Killing Blade Technique to reach Perfection, one would only have grasped the first level of Killing Intent. To break through and comprehend the second level of Killing Intent would be even more difficult.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the Wind and Thunder Blade Technique reaching Perfection, I have only attained the third level of Wind and Thunder Blade Intent."</p><p></p><p>"This means that the cultivation of True Intent is not as easy as it seems!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Wind and Thunder Blade Technique is among the top-tier Excellent Martial Arts, and for such a high-level martial art to reach Perfection, it has only allowed him to break through to the third level of True Intent.</p><p></p><p>It shows that.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty of breaking through True Intent is immense.</p><p></p><p>Only by reaching the sixth level of True Intent can one be considered to have entered the Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>Up to this point.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has mastered three major True Intents.</p><p></p><p>Killing Intent Lv.2! Wind and Thunder Intent Lv.3!</p><p>Tyrannical Blade Intent Lv.8!</p><p></p><p>It's worth mentioning that all three True Intents are related to blade techniques, which brings great benefits.</p><p></p><p>Once Gu Qingfeng has accumulated enough Blade True Intent, he can directly use this opportunity to refine and promote his Tyrannical Blade Intent, allowing it to break through further.</p><p></p><p>Until now.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has been contemplating the Tyrannical Blade Intent, but he has still not been able to make it reach Perfection and break through to the ninth level of True Intent.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng turned his gaze back to the other areas of the attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts he truly needs to improve now are not many, mainly the Prajnaparamita Sutra and the Scarlet Flame Divine Skill, and then the Tyrannical Blade Technique.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's thoughts stirred slightly as he tried to break through the Crimson Flame Divine Art.</p><p></p><p>"Breakthrough in the Crimson Flame Divine Art!"</p><p></p><p>"Requires 50 Advancement Points to upgrade!"</p><p></p><p>Perceiving the information in his mind, Gu Qingfeng's expression became clear.</p><p></p><p>As expected.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Divine Art was not a transcendent martial art, but a true Grandmaster-level martial art.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, this advancement would not have been a regular breakthrough, but a direct limit-breaking upgrade.</p><p></p><p>However—</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng saw that upgrading a Grandmaster-level martial art required 50 Advancement Points, his heart trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Fifty Advancement Points.</p><p></p><p>That was not a small amount.</p><p></p><p>At least until now, for Gu Qingfeng to accumulate 50 Advancement Points, it would take him at least one or two years.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these were only temporary concerns.</p><p></p><p>In the future, when the Gu family's population grows, the speed of obtaining Advancement Points will increase significantly.</p><p></p><p>Before that—</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not break through the Crimson Flame Divine Art, but instead turned his gaze to the Prajna Sutra.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Prajna Sutra advanced to the Fourth Realm of Perfection!</p><p>Consumed 10 Advancement Points!</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's thoughts stirred, and he directly upgraded the Prajna Sutra to Perfection.</p><p></p><p>However, the moment the Prajna Sutra broke through to Perfection, Gu Qingfeng felt a tremendously powerful force awakening within his body.</p><p></p><p>Perfect Marrow Cleansing!</p><p></p><p>Without any accidents.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at his own attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>He saw that the moment he achieved Perfect Marrow Cleansing, his lifespan increased by another 400 years.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Gu Qingfeng's lifespan had reached 1,200 years.</p><p></p><p>"1,200 years, who says that the Martial Way cannot achieve longevity?!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes shone with brilliance.</p><p></p><p>Perfect Marrow Cleansing granted him a lifespan of 1,200 years, which was far superior to that of cultivators at the same level.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng understood that from the moment he stepped into the Perfected Martial Way, the legend that the Martial Way cannot achieve longevity had been completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Way can indeed achieve longevity!</p><p></p><p>As long as the physical body is pure and perfect, the lifespan can be greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>If Marrow Cleansing could achieve this, then when he reaches the level of Perfect Refinement of the Viscera, or even Grandmaster, Gu Qingfeng believed that his lifespan would reach a terrifying degree.</p><p></p><p>At that time, longevity and eternal life would no longer be mere illusions.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Gu Qingfeng suppressed the excitement in his heart.</p><p></p><p>For now, the most important thing for Gu Qingfeng was to step into the path of Perfect Viscera Refinement.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the remaining Advancement Points, Gu Qingfeng's thoughts stirred, and he directly upgraded the Prajna Sutra to the Fifth Realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Prajna Sutra (Fifth Realm, Prajna True Body Level 4)!</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When this martial art reached the Fifth Realm, Gu Qingfeng felt that his original heart seemed to undergo a terrifying transformation, and the terrifying vital energy within it was being replenished, spreading throughout his limbs and body in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the First Realm of Perfect Viscera Refinement!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng closed his eyes and examined his body. He found that his heart now had a different, mysterious quality, and the blood being replenished from it was no longer the deep red as before, but had a faint golden hue.</p><p></p><p>Yes, golden!</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng realized that his blood had now become somewhat different. In this golden blood, he sensed a completely different aura, as if the blood had been imbued with a mysterious power.</p><p></p><p>This transformation left Gu Qingfeng's brows slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

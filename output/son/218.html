            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stepped into Wuzhou, feeling the rich spiritual energy of the land, his expression slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>He found that the spiritual energy here was much more abundant than in Qingyun State.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng then understood why the Martial Ancestor had established a foothold in Wuzhou.</p><p></p><p>For martial cultivators,</p><p></p><p>the cultivation is inseparable from the refining of the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>In the early stages, it is enough to refine the bones and muscles normally, with the assistance of medicinal baths and the like.</p><p></p><p>But when it comes to the realm of Grandmaster and beyond, the resources required to break through by relying solely on such methods are truly massive.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy of heaven and earth,</p><p></p><p>has become the primary choice for martial cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy in Wuzhou is at least one and a half times more abundant than in Qingyun State. Cultivating here is naturally different from other places.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>this is only temporary.</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Yang established the Shenwu Dynasty in Qingyun State, and then set the capital in Guangyang Prefecture, the spiritual energy of the Nine States has been converging towards Qingyun State.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy in Qingyun State is now gradually recovering.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly,</p><p></p><p>with the passage of time, the spiritual energy concentration in Qingyun State in the future may be the highest in the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>Behind him,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun said respectfully, "The Martial Ancestor chose Wuzhou because the spiritual energy here was abundant."</p><p></p><p>This time Gu Qingfeng came to Wuzhou, not alone, but accompanied by Gu Yun, the Sect Master of the Shenwu Sect.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly and continued on his way.</p><p></p><p>The two of them, one in front and one behind, headed towards the Shenwu Sect.</p><p></p><p>This trip to the Shenwu Sect, Gu Qingfeng did not alert many people, nor did he dispatch a large army to accompany him.</p><p></p><p>Before long,</p><p></p><p>the two of them entered the Shenwu Sect.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they entered the mountain gate, a disciple of the Shenwu Sect came out, and upon seeing Gu Yun beside him, hurriedly bowed in salute.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple greets the Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, you may go about your business."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun clasped his hands behind his back, acting loftily as he slightly nodded, and the disciple respectfully withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>he looked at Gu Qingfeng beside him, and his expression became reverential again.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Shenwu Sect. Gu Venerable, why don't you stay here for a few days, and then I'll bring you the things the Martial Ancestor left behind in the sect for you to have a look?"</p><p></p><p>"That's fine."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Yun's hopeful gaze, Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>He had finally managed to invite Gu Qingfeng to come to the Shenwu Sect, and he naturally did not want the other party to leave immediately.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Qingfeng's consent, Gu Yun personally arranged accommodation for him.</p><p></p><p>It was a courtyard in the back mountains of the Shenwu Sect, with a beautiful environment and abundant spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun said, "This courtyard is said to have been where the Martial Ancestor lived before his ascension, but after the Martial Ancestor's ascension, no one has been qualified to live here.</p><p></p><p>However, the successive Sect Masters of the Shenwu Sect have often come here to clean up.</p><p></p><p>Now that Gu Venerable has come, you can stay here."</p><p></p><p>"You have thought it through!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was quite satisfied with the environment in front of him, and then looked at the hesitant Gu Yun beside him and said.</p><p></p><p>"I see that there are quite a few disciples in the Shenwu Sect. While I stay here for a few days, if there are any disciples with good aptitude, you can bring them here, and I will give them some guidance."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Gu Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun immediately expressed his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>The reason he wanted Gu Qingfeng to stay in the Shenwu Sect for a few days was precisely for this purpose.</p><p></p><p>For a cultivator of Gu Qingfeng's level, as long as he is willing to give a few words of guidance, it would be a lifetime benefit for ordinary martial artists.</p><p></p><p>As for this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not really mind.</p><p></p><p>After all, he came here to gain benefits from the Shenwu Sect, and it would be unreasonable to be completely ungiving.</p><p></p><p>After Gu Yun left, Gu Qingfeng began to examine the courtyard in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The layout of this courtyard was simple, but it had a natural and unrestrained feel to it. In the courtyard stood a jujube tree, its gnarled roots like a coiling dragon, and the trunk was filled with the aura of age.</p><p></p><p>Clearly,</p><p></p><p>this tree had existed for an extremely long time.</p><p></p><p>Normally,</p><p></p><p>a jujube tree would not live for such a long time.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng approached the jujube tree, he saw the tree sway slightly, and a faint fluctuation emanated from it, making him even more surprised.</p><p></p><p>"This is... about to nurture spiritual intelligence?"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder... no wonder this tree can live for so long!"</p><p></p><p>Immortal or demonic! The jujube tree in front of him had obviously lived for countless years and was about to nurture spiritual intelligence. If the jujube tree truly nurtured spiritual intelligence, how would it be different from the legendary demons?</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng's palm fell on the trunk, he could clearly feel the tree tremble slightly, and there seemed to be a mysterious Dao rhythm flowing on it.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>in his vision, a scene suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>The courtyard was still the courtyard! The jujube tree was still the jujube tree!</p><p></p><p>The difference was,</p><p></p><p>in the image, the jujube tree was not as thick as it is now, and there was a middle-aged man in green robes who would occasionally speak to the jujube tree, sometimes drink tea and play chess under the tree, and sometimes practice martial arts in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Spring came and autumn went.</p><p></p><p>Flowers bloomed and withered.</p><p></p><p>The jujube tree grew thicker and thicker day by day, but the appearance of the middle-aged man in green robes never changed.</p><p></p><p>But before long,</p><p></p><p>white hair appeared at the temples of the middle-aged man, and he could no longer resist the erosion of time, his body gradually aging.</p><p></p><p>Again, day after day.</p><p></p><p>Year after year.</p><p></p><p>The young man became old, and the decrepit body still repeated the things he did in his youth, and then the scene dissipated.</p><p></p><p>A sense of sorrow emanated from the jujube tree.</p><p></p><p>"Was that person the Martial Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured to himself, as if talking to the jujube tree in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Until he saw the scene just now, Gu Qingfeng finally understood why the jujube tree in front of him was so extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>It had accompanied the Martial Ancestor, day and night by his side, nourished by the Martial Ancestor's martial dao, and with the abundant spiritual energy of the Shenwu Sect, it naturally developed some mystical qualities over time.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>the Dao rhythm and traces of the Martial Ancestor were also left on the jujube tree. If later comers could perceive the Dao rhythm on the jujube tree, they could see such a scene.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>without reaching a certain level of cultivation, it would be extremely difficult to discover the clues within.</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p></p><p>this also indirectly shows that the Martial Ancestor of the Shenwu Sect was extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Far beyond the reach of ordinary Transcendent Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Dao rhythm remaining for thousands of years without dissipating is enough to show the unfathomable depth of such a powerful figure.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sat down at the foot of the jujube tree, just like the Martial Ancestor did in the past, and the jujube tree swayed slightly, as if emanating a mysterious Dao rhythm.</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes, as if entering a state of enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like a day,</p><p></p><p>or it seemed like a year.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's motionless figure at the foot of the jujube tree, but a mysterious Dao rhythm permeated his body.</p><p></p><p>As the sun set in the west and the jade bow hung high,</p><p></p><p>when the morning sun rose in the east, Gu Qingfeng finally opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He exhaled a turbid breath, and then looked at his own attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng  Age: 51/3000  Realm: Extreme Dao Grandmaster Perfected</p><p></p><p>Martial Arts: Heaven Thunder Sword Technique (Initiate), Prajna Sutra (13th Layer Perfected, Prajna True Body 12th Level), Heavenly Vein Sutra (2nd Layer), Longevity Sutra (Perfected, Longevity 5th Level), Pure Yang True Body (Perfected, Flesh Body Pure Yang 4th Level), Heavenly Saber (Perfected, Heavenly Saber Realm 1st Level), Refine Blood Sutra (Perfected, Divine Blood 8th Level), Divine Movement Hundred Changes (Perfected, Divine Speed 4th Level), Thirty-Six Golden Body (Perfected, Golden Body 9th Level), Great Wasteland Fist Classic (Unlearned)  Upgrade Points: 5032...</p><p></p><p>"The Great Wasteland Fist Classic!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>He knew,</p><p></p><p>this was the legacy left behind by the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wasteland Fist Classic!</p><p></p><p>This was an unparalleled supreme art that had broken through the Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly,</p><p></p><p>the profundity of this martial art could completely match his own Heavenly Saber.</p><p></p><p>Even,</p><p></p><p>the Great Wasteland Fist Classic might be a bit more profound than the Heavenly Saber.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that the Shenwu Sect has not produced a true Dao Grandmaster so far, and they have not been able to discover the clues here. Otherwise, the Shenwu Sect, relying on this martial art, would have achievements beyond the present."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wasteland Fist Classic was extremely profound, and without the realm of Dao Grandmaster, even if one obtained it, it would be difficult to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>After all, high-level martial arts are not just simple techniques, but a manifestation of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Without a deep enough understanding of the power of the Dao, it would be difficult to cultivate the Great Wasteland Fist Classic.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that,</p><p></p><p>the minimum requirement to cultivate this Great Wasteland Fist Classic is the realm of Dao Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>But the problem is,</p><p></p><p>the Shenwu Sect does not even have a Grandmaster, let alone a Dao Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had a thought and directly upgraded the Great Wasteland Fist Classic.</p><p></p><p>200 Upgrade Points! Great Wasteland Fist Classic Initiate!</p><p></p><p>200 Upgrade Points! Great Wasteland Fist Classic Mastered!</p><p></p><p>200 Upgrade Points...</p><p></p><p>In less than a moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had upgraded the Great Wasteland Fist Classic from unlearned to the Perfected stage in one breath.</p><p></p><p>Fully Mastered Great Wasteland Fist Classic.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a flood of memories surged forth.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>an earth-shattering fist intent emanated from Gu Qingfeng's body, forming a realm that covered the vast Shenwu Sect.</p><p></p><p>All the people of the Shenwu Sect felt this terrifying aura pressure, and their blood and qi became greatly stagnant.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>this aura pressure came and went quickly.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, it had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Great Wasteland Fist Classic (Perfected, Great Wasteland Realm 4th Level)!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The Great Wasteland Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng now seemed to have cultivated the Great Wasteland Fist Classic for many years, and this martial art had truly reached a pinnacle of perfection.</p><p></p><p>The only regret is that,</p><p></p><p>the Great Wasteland Fist Classic, which has broken through the Grandmaster limit, does not have the effect of tempering the flesh and body like other ordinary Grandmaster and Dao Grandmaster martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise,</p><p></p><p>with the power of this martial art, Gu Qingfeng could break through the Extreme Dao Grandmaster limit and step into an even higher realm.</p><p></p><p>However, despite this,</p><p></p><p>after truly comprehending the profundity of the Great Wasteland Fist Classic, Gu Qingfeng's strength has risen to a new level even without any breakthrough in his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>To be honest,</p><p></p><p>with his current cultivation level steadily increasing, Gu Qingfeng is not even sure what his true strength has reached.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun had arrived.</p><p></p><p>Behind him were five disciples of the Shenwu Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Venerable, these are the most outstanding disciples of our Shenwu Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun directly spoke.</p><p></p><p>He had wanted to ask Gu Qingfeng about the fleeting aura pressure just now, but after seeing him, Gu Yun suppressed this thought.</p><p></p><p>Now that this figure was presiding over the Shenwu Sect, the previous changes were obviously related to him.</p><p></p><p>Some things, if he was willing to say, he would naturally say, and if he asked too much, it would be somewhat presumptuous.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Gu Yun's words fell, the five people also clasped their fists and saluted Gu Qingfeng in unison.</p><p></p><p>"Greet Venerable Senior Gu!"</p><p></p><p>Before coming here, Gu Yun had already told these people about Gu Qingfeng's identity. Towards this renowned Martial Saint, they did not dare to show the slightest disrespect.</p><p></p><p>Not only that,</p><p></p><p>their gaze towards Gu Qingfeng, besides awe, also contained a reverence for the strong.</p><p></p><p>Martial Saint Gu Qingfeng! The number one expert in the Nine States now.</p><p></p><p>Rumored to be on par with the Martial Ancestor from thousands of years ago, an existence of the highest level.</p><p></p><p>On the path of martial dao,</p><p></p><p>the one before their eyes is truly the pinnacle.</p><p></p><p>Having the chance to truly see such a powerful figure, for these Shenwu Sect disciples, it was already a great honor.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's gaze also fell on the five people.</p><p></p><p>Three men and two women, their ages were not too old, at most around twenty to twenty-five years old.</p><p></p><p>At Gu Qingfeng's level of cultivation, he only needed to observe one person to see their bone age.</p><p></p><p>Among the five people, the weakest in cultivation was at the Bone Refining Realm Perfected, and the strongest had even stepped into the Blood Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>Looking across the Nine States,</p><p></p><p>people of such young age who could reach this realm could be considered true geniuses.</p><p></p><p>From this, one could see that these people were indeed the outstanding disciples of the Shenwu Sect.</p><p></p><p>"At such a young age to have such cultivation is not bad. In the future, as long as there are no accidents, breaking through to the Martial Grandmaster realm is a certainty, and they even have a chance to break through to the Dao Grandmaster realm!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded, giving them some affirmation.</p><p></p><p>Hearing his words, Gu Yun's expression immediately brightened.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun also said, "Then the disciples will take their leave and not disturb Gu Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>"You stay as well."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng gl</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Divine Martial Ancestor did not leave behind a single disciple.</p><p></p><p>However, </p><p></p><p>Aside from the shame,</p><p></p><p>The ancient words also contained a hint of wild joy.</p><p></p><p>The inheritance left behind by the Martial Ancestor was undoubtedly extremely powerful. Now that Gu Qingfeng had obtained this inheritance and was willing to pass it on to the Divine Martial Sect, then with the help of this inheritance, there was hope for reviving the sect.</p><p></p><p>Before Gu Yun could ponder too much, Gu Qingfeng raised his hand and pointed, and at that moment, a profound Dao rhythm entered the minds of the six people including Gu Yun.</p><p></p><p>In an instant,</p><p></p><p>The few of them were like they had been subjected to a paralysis technique, their eyes instinctively closing, silently digesting the information.</p><p></p><p>An hour passed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun was the first to regain consciousness.</p><p></p><p>He reviewed the memories that had appeared in his mind, his expression filled with excitement and gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master Gu, for imparting the Dao to us!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun solemnly bowed to Gu Qingfeng, his expression sincere, without a trace of falsehood.</p><p></p><p>He now had a martial art called the Great Desolation Fist Sutra in his mind, which was much more profound than any of the Divine Martial Sect's previous supreme skills.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had obtained the memories related to the Great Desolation Fist Sutra, Gu Yun still felt a sense of bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>This feeling,</p><p></p><p>Gave rise to a thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>That is,</p><p></p><p>Mastering the Dao! This was a martial art that truly involved the realm of the Dao, incomparable to ordinary martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Although he currently could not comprehend any of the profundities of the Great Desolation Fist Sutra, this was still an opportunity. If one day he could comprehend even a little of the profundities of the Great Desolation Fist Sutra, he could also unleash boundless power.</p><p></p><p>For this, Gu Yun was extremely grateful.</p><p></p><p>After all, a martial art of the level of the Great Desolation Fist Sutra, anyone who obtained it would not easily reveal it.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Qingfeng had not said anything, he would not have known about it.</p><p></p><p>But now that the other party was willing to leave this martial art in the Divine Martial Sect, it was enough to show his magnanimity.</p><p></p><p>Another hour passed.</p><p></p><p>The other five people also gradually regained consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the shocked expressions on their faces, Gu Qingfeng said, "The Great Desolation Fist Sutra is a martial art that can break through the limits of the Great Grandmaster, but it is extremely difficult for true Grandmasters to truly cultivate.</p><p></p><p>However, for ordinary martial artists, even if they cannot truly enter the door of the Great Desolation Fist Sutra, just glimpsing its profundities can be of immense benefit!"</p><p></p><p>"Today, this seat will leave you another opportunity, so watch carefully!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng went to the center of the courtyard, and with a seemingly casual punch, the void suddenly shattered.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun and the others all widened their eyes, staring at that punch that had broken through the void, their blood and qi trembling, their bodies unable to move at all.</p><p></p><p>Shattering the void!</p><p></p><p>What a concept is this! Such a terrifying power made the few of them feel that if even a little of that power were to touch them, they would be instantly reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Such terrifying power,</p><p></p><p>Was enough to make one's heart sink into despair.</p><p></p><p>After a while,</p><p></p><p>They finally snapped out of their shock.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>They discovered that on the ground of the courtyard, there was already a fist print left there, as if it had been there naturally, exuding a terrifying aura and boundless profundity.</p><p></p><p>"This is this seat's slight comprehension of the Great Desolation Fist Sutra, and now it is left here. How much you can comprehend in the future depends entirely on your own opportunities.</p><p></p><p>This can also be considered this seat's compensation for obtaining the Martial Ancestor's inheritance and bestowing it upon the Divine Martial Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The Dao rhythm contained in this fist print could not possibly last for thousands of years like the Martial Ancestor's Dao rhythm.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Martial Ancestor's Dao rhythm could last so long, which also had something to do with the existence of the jujube tree.</p><p></p><p>But nonetheless,</p><p></p><p>This Dao fist print can last for a hundred years, which is not a problem.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years,</p><p></p><p>It remains to be seen how much the people of the Divine Martial Sect can comprehend from it, which depends entirely on their own opportunities.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Qingfeng's view, as long as the people of the Divine Martial Sect are not too stupid, they should be able to comprehend a few of the profundities of the Great Desolation Fist Sutra through this fist print without any problem.</p><p></p><p>In the future,</p><p></p><p>Whether the Divine Martial Sect will have someone who can truly cultivate the Great Desolation Fist Sutra depends on whether a true Grandmaster will emerge.</p><p></p><p>Without the cultivation realm of a true Grandmaster, it is absolutely impossible to truly cultivate the Great Desolation Fist Sutra.</p><p></p><p>At the moment,</p><p></p><p>The strongest one in the Divine Martial Sect who has the most hope of breaking through to true Grandmaster is actually Gu Yun.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun looked at the fist print, his heart also slightly touched, as if he had touched upon something, but still could not grasp it.</p><p></p><p>However, he had a premonition.</p><p></p><p>If he could grasp this bit of enlightenment this time, perhaps it would be the time for him to break through to Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>"The disciple has a slight enlightenment, and needs to go back and cultivate in seclusion for a while, so I'll take my leave first!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun immediately cupped his hands and left, leaving behind a few disciples who had followed him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded, and then looked at the few people in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"You can all say what you have in the way of martial arts, and I will enlighten you."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior Gu!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the few of them were overjoyed, and for the moment did not ponder the profundities of that fist print or the memories of the Great Desolation Fist Sutra in their minds.</p><p></p><p>For them, these things could be contemplated later, and the most important thing now was to seize this opportunity and receive Gu Qingfeng's guidance.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>For two consecutive days,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was guiding and instructing the few of them in their cultivation. For problems below the Grandmaster realm, he would often point out the key with just a few words, making them feel that they had gained immensely.</p><p></p><p>Two days later,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "You don't need to come tomorrow, I've already taught you what I needed to. As for how far you can go in the future, it depends on yourselves."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior, for your guidance these two days, we will never forget it!"</p><p></p><p>The five of them exchanged glances, and although there was some regret in their eyes, they could only withdraw as instructed.</p><p></p><p>After all, for such a powerful expert to be willing to guide them for two days was already a great fortune, and they could not demand too much.</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p></p><p>The gains from these two days of guidance were equivalent to ten years of arduous cultivation. If they could fully digest the enlightenment they had gained, they would not encounter any major bottlenecks before breaking through to Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Such an opportunity was already not small, so the five of them would not be greedy.</p><p></p><p>Being able to obtain the cultivation of the Divine Martial Sect, they regarded it as the foundation for their future, and naturally not only required talent, but also character and conduct in all aspects.</p><p></p><p>On the fourth day after arriving at the Divine Martial Sect,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun arrived in a leisurely manner.</p><p></p><p>His appearance now was slightly younger than before, and his aura had also become much stronger, the powerful blood and qi force not fully contained, occasionally leaking out, making people feel a sense of awe.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Sect Master Gu, for suddenly attaining the realm of Grandmaster!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled slightly and congratulated him.</p><p></p><p>With just one glance, he could see that Gu Yun had already broken through the bottleneck of Half-step Grandmaster and truly entered the ranks of Martial Dao Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>To be honest,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was also a bit surprised that Gu Yun could break through so quickly.</p><p></p><p>This also indirectly showed that his foundation was already very solid, otherwise he would not have been able to attain the realm of Martial Dao Grandmaster so quickly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun's smile on his face was difficult to suppress, but the reverence and gratitude in his eyes towards Gu Qingfeng had increased a lot.</p><p></p><p>"If it were not for Senior Gu's guidance, the disciple might not have had the opportunity to break through to Grandmaster in this lifetime. Senior Gu's kindness is like being reborn, and the disciple is deeply grateful!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun felt that his decision to invite Gu Qingfeng to the Divine Martial Sect was extremely wise.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for this,</p><p></p><p>How could he have broken through to Grandmaster so quickly.</p><p></p><p>But even after breaking through to Grandmaster, Gu Yun did not feel arrogant.</p><p></p><p>He was clear that even though he had stepped into the realm of Grandmaster, in front of this person, he was still just a junior.</p><p></p><p>With the other party's unfathomable strength, a casual gesture could suppress him.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>When his words fell, Gu Yun directly handed the wooden box he had brought to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"This is the thing left behind by the Martial Ancestor, please take a look, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng heard this and immediately took the wooden box, then opened it, and a long sword with a frosty blade appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this sword, Gu Qingfeng could feel that it was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>In this divine weapon, he seemed to sense an aura similar to the Demon-Slaying Saber.</p><p></p><p>And in the wooden box, in addition to this divine sword, there was also a jade slip left behind.</p><p></p><p>When he saw this jade slip, Gu Qingfeng's eyes slightly moved, and he immediately had a sense of familiarity.</p><p></p><p>This kind of jade slip,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was no stranger to.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Gu Yang had brought a jade slip, allowing Gu Qingfeng to see a secret technique called the Forging Immortal Hall.</p><p></p><p>Now that he saw the appearance of this jade slip, Gu Qingfeng was not very surprised, but rather confirmed the many guesses he had in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun said, "This sword is called Qingyu, and it was the saber that the Martial Ancestor left behind. This sword contains a portion of the Martial Ancestor's power, and this is also the fundamental reason why the Divine Martial Sect has been able to stand firm in the Wu State for so many years."</p><p></p><p>"Not long after the news of the Martial Ancestor's passing spread, there were many forces that invaded the Divine Martial Sect, wanting to seize the Martial Ancestor's inheritance. Later, the predecessors of the Divine Martial Sect drew out the Qingyu sword and slew a Martial Dao Grandmaster, which finally intimidated the various forces."</p><p></p><p>"In the following millennium years, there were also immortal sects' top experts who invaded, but they were all killed by the Qingyu sword."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, every time the Qingyu sword is used, the power left behind by the Martial Ancestor will weaken a bit.</p><p></p><p>So unless it's absolutely necessary, the Divine Martial Sect now doesn't dare to casually use the power of this precious treasure!"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun could not help but smile bitterly.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Martial Sect has been able to stand firm for a millennium, all relying on the divine weapon left behind by the Martial Ancestor as a deterrent. Compared to this, the Divine Martial Sect's later generations seem rather incompetent.</p><p></p><p>But there's no help for it, the later generations of the Divine Martial Sect are indeed not outstanding, and there's nothing to defend.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Martial Ancestor's saber left behind to intimidate the various forces, the Divine Martial Sect would have been destroyed long ago.</p><p></p><p>"This sword is indeed extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng's gaze fell on the Qingyu sword, he nodded.</p><p></p><p>The power hidden in this sword has already become much weaker, but even so, it is still unstoppable for those below the Penetrating Celestial realm.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>If faced with a Penetrating Celestial realm expert, the Qingyu sword would be somewhat inadequate.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the Qingyu sword a millennium ago could have the power to subdue a Penetrating Celestial, but now the power contained in the Qingyu sword has already weakened considerably.</p><p></p><p>This is also normal.</p><p></p><p>After all, this is a saber left behind by the Martial Ancestor a millennium ago, and the fact that it still has the power to subdue Grandmasters is already quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>This also further proves that the strength of the Martial Ancestor back then was indeed very powerful.</p><p></p><p>Then,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun pointed to the jade slip and said, "This jade slip was left behind together with the Martial Ancestor's saber, but over the years, the strong experts of our Divine Martial Sect have researched it and found that they only need to press the jade slip against their forehead to use it.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the jade slip has a powerful restriction, and the successive strong experts of the Divine Martial Sect have been unable to break the restriction."</p><p></p><p>Finished speaking,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun sighed bitterly again.</p><p></p><p>The things the Martial Ancestor left behind were indeed many, but it was the later generations of the Divine Martial Sect who were not outstanding, and they were unable to obtain any of them.</p><p></p><p>Only the Qingyu sword was able to guard the sect.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Yun could also see that the power in the Qingyu sword was gradually weakening, and if the Divine Martial Sect could not change, when the power in the Qingyu sword was completely exhausted, the Divine Martial Sect would also lose its strongest deterrent.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>These are all things of the past.</p><p></p><p>With the Great Desolation Fist Sutra that Gu Qingfeng imparted, the Divine Martial Sect has a new trump card.</p><p></p><p>As long as there are people in the sect who can comprehend the profundities of the Great Desolation Fist Sutra, it is enough to ensure the long-term prosperity of the Divine Martial Sect.</p><p></p><p>On the other side,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng heard this and also pressed the jade slip against his forehead. Just as Gu Yun had said, there was indeed a restrictive force in the jade slip blocking later generations from exploring it.</p><p></p><p>However, this restrictive force was not very strong, and Gu Qingfeng only needed to use a little true essence power to completely shatter the restriction.</p><p></p><p>As the restriction was shattered,</p><p></p><p>A huge amount of information surged out from within.</p><p></p><p>Such a terrifying and overwhelming amount of information, even with Gu Qingfeng's current cultivation, took him a long time to barely suppress.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>He looked at Gu Yun and said,</p><p></p><p>"This seat will ponder the things inside for a while, you can go back first."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Gu Qingfeng returned the Qingyu sword to Gu Yun's hands, and as for the jade slip he had, it had already completely crumbled into powder.</p><p></p><p>"The disciple takes his leave!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Yun naturally understood that Gu Qingfeng must have obtained some things from the jade slip, but he did not ask too much, taking the wooden box containing the Qingyu sword and respectfully withdrawing.</p><p></p><p>After Gu Yun left, Gu Qingfeng sat down cross-legged under the j</p>

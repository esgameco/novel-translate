        <h1>Chapter 157</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Everywhere, the ground was littered with corpses.</p><p></p><p>These corpses.</p><p></p><p>There were men and women, both old and young.</p><p></p><p>And in a certain side room, several carefree young men held several disheveled women in their arms, and there were many women timidly serving by their sides.</p><p></p><p>And on the floor of the room, there were many corpses lying there.</p><p></p><p>"Come, everyone, drink to your heart's content. It must be said that although Guangyang Prefecture is ordinary, the beauties and fine wines here are not few!"</p><p></p><p>A young man laughed recklessly, his right hand reaching into the clothes of the woman in his arms, forcefully groping her. The woman showed a painful expression, but dared not make a sound.</p><p></p><p>Because those who made a sound earlier had already become mute corpses.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Jiang, if we do this, if the Guangyang King investigates it, it will surely be a big trouble!"</p><p></p><p>A young man looked slightly worried.</p><p></p><p>To this,</p><p></p><p>Jiang sneered: "What's there to fear about the Guangyang King? When the Taiyang Sword Sect comes, Gu Yang and the Gu Family Manor behind him will surely be reduced to ashes."</p><p></p><p>"Do you really think that a mere Grand Master can be undefeatable in this world?"</p><p></p><p>"This world will ultimately be the world of our Immortal Sects. A mere Grand Master cannot stir up any waves."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, we are disciples of the Taisuzu Sect, why should we fear a martial arts force?"</p><p></p><p>"The Gu Family Manor has already offended the Taiyang Sword Sect, do they still have the guts to offend our Taisuzu Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang's face was full of arrogance, and his words did not put the Guangyang King and the Gu Family Manor in his eyes at all.</p><p></p><p>After all, in his eyes, the so-called Guangyang King and Gu Family Manor were nothing compared to the Immortal Sects.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention a Guangyang King.</p><p></p><p>Even in the prosperous days of the ancient Taixuan Dynasty, they had to be polite to the Immortal Sects, for fear of offending them even a little.</p><p></p><p>Because.</p><p></p><p>The so-called dynastic forces were all supported by the ancestral families of the Immortal Sects.</p><p></p><p>The rise and fall of dynasties.</p><p></p><p>Were all under their control.</p><p></p><p>This.</p><p></p><p>Was Jiang's confidence.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Before his words had even fallen, the door suddenly shattered, and the noisy sounds in the room were abruptly silenced.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi stepped in.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the corpses on the ground, and his already indifferent expression seemed to have become even colder.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Several disciples of the Taisuzu Sect were furious, and one of them directly rebuked.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you, daring to cause trouble on our Taisuzu Sect's turfâ€”"</p><p></p><p>Before he could even finish his words, a flash of a blade appeared, and the head of the young man who spoke fell from his neck, and a gush of blood spurted out, splashing the surrounding people.</p><p></p><p>"This is Guangyang Prefecture, when did it become the turf of the Taisuzu Sect!"</p><p></p><p>After slaying that Taisuzu Sect disciple, Gu Yi slowly spoke, his expression unchanged from beginning to end, as if killing a person was as easy as crushing an ant for him.</p><p></p><p>"By order of the Guangyang King, any who dare to stir up trouble will be punished accordingly!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Jiang and the others finally reacted.</p><p></p><p>The former looked at Gu Yi with a gaze of shock, but more of anger.</p><p></p><p>"I am an inner disciple of the Taisuzu Sect, and my father is an elder of the Taisuzu Sect. You kneel down and cut off both your arms, and I might spare your dog's life.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, I will make sure you cannot seek life nor find death!!"</p><p></p><p>As the esteemed son of an elder of the Immortal Sect, Jiang was furious that someone dared to not show him respect. He had already decided that after Gu Yi cut off his own arms, he would...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>How to torture the other party.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Jiang Mo's plan was good, but Gu Yi did not speak, but responded with a flash of a knife.</p><p></p><p>In the moment the knife slashed down, Jiang Mo felt as if he was being targeted by a terrifying existence. Without thinking, he directly pulled someone beside him.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he broke through the room and rushed outside.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the knife light slashed down, directly splitting a disciple of the Taisuzu Sect in half.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi did not hurry to chase and kill Jiang Mo, but struck again, slaughtering all the remaining disciples of the Taisuzu Sect on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the evil spirits reviving among these corpses, Gu Yi had the following guards suppress these reviving evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>After doing these things, Gu Yi looked at the few trembling women hiding in the corner, then stepped out of the room.</p><p></p><p>Outside the room was a street. The earlier Jiang Mo who had rushed out of the room had already been captured by the guards. Many civilians and others were watching this scene.</p><p></p><p>The latter struggled frantically and shouted angrily, "My father is the elder of the Taisuzu Sect, Jiang Shidao, who dares to kill me!"</p><p></p><p>"I dare to kill you!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Yi's expression was cold, and his long knife at his waist suddenly slashed out, instantly severing Jiang Mo's head.</p><p></p><p>The expression on Jiang Mo's severed head was full of astonishment, obviously completely unprepared that Gu Yi would dare to kill him even after knowing his identity.</p><p></p><p>This scene, in the eyes of the others, was also terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Mo is dead!"</p><p></p><p>"Whew, does that Guangyang King really not fear offending the Taisuzu Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Publicly beheading a disciple of the Immortal Sect, that Guangyang King has already invited death!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems there will be a good show next. I heard that the strong ones from the Taisuzu Sect who came to Guangyang Prefecture this time are led by Jiang Shidao. Now that his son has been tragically killed by the guards, I'm afraid he won't sit still."</p><p></p><p>"Although that's the case, the strength of the guards is not bad either, with several Xiantian Sect Masters."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, even if there are many Xiantian Sect Masters, what use is it? Offending the Immortal Sect, even if they are Great Sect Masters, they will not escape death."</p><p></p><p>Many people of influence were whispering and discussing, their gazes towards Gu Yi and the other guards were like looking at the dead.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, killing Jiang Mo and offending the Immortal Sect, not only Gu Yi would die, even the Guangyang King behind him would be implicated.</p><p></p><p>For this, these people were gloating.</p><p></p><p>Even though many factions were not on good terms with the Taisuzu Sect, they now also hoped to see the miserable end of the guards.</p><p></p><p>After all, as cultivators, how could they have fallen to the point of being publicly beheaded by a martial artist.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi's beheading of Jiang Mo was not just about the head, but also the dignity of the cultivator.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Mo was dead, and the evil spirits within him had also revived.</p><p></p><p>The guards were well prepared, directly sealing the revived evil spirits in the prepared golden coffin.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>At the moment the guards sealed the evil spirits, a terrifyingly powerful aura suddenly erupted, and then a black-robed old man stepped in from the air.</p><p></p><p>The eerie and cold aura ravaged the air, causing the temperature to plummet.</p><p></p><p>When he saw Jiang Mo's corpse, the black-robed old man's pupils turned blood red, looking at the leading Gu Yi with a ferocious and twisted killing intent on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Daring to kill my son, I will flay you, tear out your tendons, and torture you to death bit by bit!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

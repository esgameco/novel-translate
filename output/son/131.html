        <h1>Chapter 131</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The main army was advancing when the vanguard scouts came to report.</p><p></p><p>Before Pei Jing could speak, another vanguard scout quickly arrived and cupped his hands to say:</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the latest news has arrived. Gu Yang, the lord of the Gu Family Manor, has led an army of 100,000 troops and already reached the North Gate Pass."</p><p></p><p>"Gu Yang!"</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing's eyes narrowed slightly. He was no stranger to Gu Yang's existence.</p><p></p><p>In the past few years, he had already thoroughly investigated the intelligence regarding the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>It was just that back then, Gu Yang had not truly caught his attention.</p><p></p><p>Until later.</p><p></p><p>It was only after Gu Yang became the new manor lord that Pei Jing truly took notice of him.</p><p></p><p>"An army of 100,000 troops stationed at the North Gate Pass, this means the Gu Family Manor also has ambitions to dominate the world, which is why they have been secretly cultivating a large army. </p><p></p><p>However, relying on a mere 100,000 troops, they think they can obstruct us is but a pipe dream."</p><p></p><p>"This time, we shall first slay Gu Yang, and then besiege the Gu Family Manor, suppressing Gu Qingfeng, to avenge Elder Duan Ping!"</p><p></p><p>The speaker was named Jiang Ning, an elder of the Tian Yang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Originally, according to the previous instructions of the Tian Yang Sect Master, the Tian Yang Sword Sect did not necessarily need to take action against the Gu Family Manor for the sake of Duan Ping.</p><p></p><p>But times have changed.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Divine Martial Army has thoroughly penetrated Guangyang Prefecture, the issue of the Gu Family Manor must be resolved as well.</p><p></p><p>However, </p><p>the Tian Yang Sect Master had also instructed that the focus should be on suppressing Gu Qingfeng, and not to kill him for the time being, but to bring him back to the Tian Yang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this order, Elders like Jiang Ning all understood the Tian Yang Sect Master's intentions.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating a human talisman! </p><p></p><p>This was not an uncommon practice. </p><p></p><p>Many ancient sects would imprison talented martial artists from the jianghu, and then raise them like livestock. Once they grew to a certain level, they would be used as nourishment.</p><p></p><p>Clearly,</p><p>that Hegemon Blade was the one the Tian Yang Sect Master valued.</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing said, "The Hegemon Blade Gu Qingfeng is suspected to be a peak True Meaning Sect Master. Suppressing him may not be easy!"</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty the Divine Martial King need not worry. This time, three of our Tian Yang Sword Sect Elders at the Fusion Spirit Realm will take action. Even if a great sect master were to come, we would still have a chance to fight, let alone just a peak True Meaning Sect Master!" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Ning sneered disdainfully, and the other two Tian Yang Sword Sect Elders also had arrogant expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Mere martial artists.</p><p>What could they amount to?</p><p></p><p>This was what Jiang Ning wanted to say, but he held back the thought, remembering that Pei Jing was also a martial artist.</p><p></p><p>"Since you Elders are confident, then this battle shall annihilate the Gu Family Manor!"</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing nodded, his eyes already brimming with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>He felt he had given Gu Qingfeng chances, but the other party had repeatedly rejected him, and they were destined to be on opposing sides.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore -</p><p>Gu Qingfeng had grown from a mere Blood Refining Realm martial artist to a peak True Meaning Sect Master in such a short time. Either he had been hiding his true strength all along, or he had an extraordinary opportunity.</p><p></p><p>If it was the former, then it would be fine. But if it was the latter -</p><p>Pei Jing's heart burned with excitement.</p><p></p><p>A heavenly opportunity that could allow a Blood Refining Realm martial artist to become a True Meaning Sect Master in such a short time, if he could obtain it, perhaps he could also step into the Great Sect Master realm.</p><p></p><p>In the world,</p><p>Great Sect Masters could be counted on one's fingers.</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing considered himself exceptionally talented, but he did not have a firm grasp of reaching the Great Sect Master realm.</p><p></p><p>Throughout history,</p><p>many demonic prodigies were stuck at the Sect Master realm, without any earth-shattering opportunities, they basically had no chance of becoming Great Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p>these demonic prodigies would choose to remain at the Sect Master realm, and directly...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Refining evil into the body.</p><p></p><p>It can be said.</p><p></p><p>Refining evil into the body.</p><p></p><p>Is the ultimate path for all martial artists in the world.</p><p></p><p>But the martial cultivation before refining evil into the body is also crucial in determining one's strength after the process.</p><p></p><p>If one can refine evil into the body at the Grand Master realm, then they will be a supreme existence in the world.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>North Gate Pass.</p><p></p><p>The army is stationed.</p><p></p><p>Flags are fluttering.</p><p></p><p>On them is a crimson "Gu" character, representing the army stationed here, which is known as the Gu Family Army.</p><p></p><p>"Report to the lord, the Divine Might Army is only five li away from the North Gate Pass!"</p><p></p><p>"Report to the lord, the Divine Might Army is only three li away from the North Gate Pass!"</p><p></p><p>"Report to the lord—"</p><p></p><p>Messages keep coming in, and Gu Yang stands on the city wall, his gaze fixed on the distance, where dense black dots are appearing. As the black dots draw nearer, a hundred-thousand-strong army comes into view.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Might Army!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang stands with his hands behind his back, his expression more serious than ever before.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Divine Might Army has not yet reached the North Gate Pass, he can already feel the aura of their iron-blooded and ruthless elite troops, forged through the baptism of blood.</p><p></p><p>In comparison,</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family Army lacks this iron-blooded killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Lord, the secret guard reports that there are three Elders from the Solar Sword Sect among the Divine Might Army, all of whom are at the Master realm!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi, standing beside Gu Yang, says in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Three Masters!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang's eyes narrow slightly.</p><p></p><p>Normally, three Masters should make him wary, but thinking of Gu Qingfeng, he feels at ease.</p><p></p><p>Even before Gu Yang led the army to the North Gate Pass, he had already sent the secret guard to inform Gu Qingfeng. Unexpectedly, his father might arrive soon.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>Even if the Solar Sword Sect has three Masters present, he may not necessarily lose this battle.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>The Divine Might Army has arrived.</p><p></p><p>The hundred-thousand-strong army is silent, and Pei Jing, looking at the figures on the city wall, shouts loudly, "Gu Yang, if you surrender now, my king can still spare your life."</p><p></p><p>"But if you stubbornly resist, when the city falls, it will be the end of you!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang scoffs contemptuously, then shouts, "I also have a piece of advice for you: leave with your army now, and I can pretend none of this ever happened."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, once the Divine Might Army attacks the city, I'm afraid the Divine Might King will be staying here forever!"</p><p></p><p>"Insolent wretch!"</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing's face turns cold upon hearing this, and with a wave of his hand, he immediately gives the order.</p><p></p><p>"Attack the city!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fall,</p><p></p><p>The hundred-thousand-strong Divine Might Army sets out.</p><p></p><p>The infantry in the front hold up their shields and advance towards the North Gate Pass, while the archers behind provide cover fire to create opportunities for the infantry.</p><p></p><p>On the other side,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang also waves his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Fire the arrows!"</p><p></p><p>With the order given,</p><p></p><p>Arrows rain down like a waterfall, falling upon the Divine Might Army.</p><p></p><p>In an instant,</p><p></p><p>The battlefield is filled with flying arrows.</p><p></p><p>In their first encounter, both sides suffer numerous casualties.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang draws his long sword at his waist, and the chilling sword light dances, effortlessly shattering all the arrows heading towards him.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after,</p><p></p><p>Siege ladders are raised, and a group of Divine Might soldiers begin climbing up, attempting to scale the city wall.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the martial artists at Blood Refining realm and above appear, directly destroying the siege ladders to prevent the soldiers from reaching the top.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The main army was advancing, and the vanguard scouts came to report.</p><p></p><p>Before Pei Jing could speak, another vanguard scout quickly arrived and cupped his hands, saying:</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the latest news has arrived. Gu Yang, the lord of the Gu Family Village, has led an army of 100,000 troops and already reached the North Gate Pass."</p><p></p><p>"Gu Yang!"</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing's eyes narrowed slightly. He was not unfamiliar with the existence of Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>In the past few years, the intelligence about the Gu Family Village had already been thoroughly investigated by him.</p><p></p><p>It was just that at that time, Gu Yang had not truly caught his attention.</p><p></p><p>Until later.</p><p></p><p>It was not until Gu Yang became the new lord that Pei Jing truly noticed his existence.</p><p></p><p>"An army of 100,000 troops stationed at the North Gate Pass, this means that the Gu Family Village also has the ambition to contend for the rule of the world, so they have secretly cultivated a large army.</p><p></p><p>However, relying on a mere 100,000 troops, they wish to obstruct us, which is but a foolish fantasy."</p><p></p><p>"This time, we shall first kill Gu Yang, and then besiege the Gu Family Village, suppress Gu Qingfeng, and avenge Elder Duan Ping!"</p><p></p><p>The speaker was named Jiang Ning, an elder of the Tian Yang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Originally, according to the previous words of the Tian Yang Sect Master, the Tian Yang Sword Sect did not need to deliberately attack the Gu Family Village for the sake of Duan Ping.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>The times have changed.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Shen Wu Army has thoroughly entered Guangyang Prefecture, the problem of the Gu Family Village needs to be resolved as well.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Yang Sect Master has also instructed on this expedition, which is to focus on suppressing Gu Qingfeng, and not to kill him for the time being, but to bring him back to the Tian Yang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this order, Elders like Jiang Ning all understood the Tian Yang Sect Master's intention.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating a pet!</p><p></p><p>This is not an uncommon practice.</p><p></p><p>Many ancient sects would imprison some talented martial artists in the jianghu, and then raise them like livestock. When they have grown to a certain extent, they would become the sect's nourishment.</p><p></p><p>Evidently.</p><p></p><p>That Hegemon Blade seems to be the one the Tian Yang Sect Master values.</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing said, "Hegemon Blade Gu Qingfeng, suspected to be a peak True Meaning Sect Master, suppressing him may not be easy!"</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty the Shen Wu King need not worry. This time, three Fusion Spirit Boundary Elders of our Tian Yang Sword Sect will take action. Even if a Grand Sect Master were to come, we would still have a chance to fight, let alone a mere peak True Meaning Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ning sneered contemptuously, and the other two Tian Yang Sword Sect Elders also had arrogant expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Mere martial artists.</p><p></p><p>What can they amount to?</p><p></p><p>This was what Jiang Ning wanted to say in his heart, but he thought of Pei Jing also being a martial artist, so he suppressed this idea.</p><p></p><p>"Since you Elders are confident, then this battle shall annihilate the Gu Family Village!"</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing nodded, and his eyes were filled with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>He believed he had given Gu Qingfeng a chance, but the other party had repeatedly refused him, and the two were destined to be on opposing sides.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore—</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's ability to grow from a small Blood Refining Realm martial artist to a peak True Meaning Sect Master in such a short time, either means that he has been hiding his true strength all along, or he has an extraordinary opportunity.</p><p></p><p>If it's the former, then it's fine, but if it's the latter—</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing's heart also burned with excitement.</p><p></p><p>A heavenly opportunity that can allow a Blood Refining Realm martial artist to achieve the realm of a True Meaning Sect Master in such a short time, if he could obtain it, perhaps he could also step into the Grand Sect Master realm.</p><p></p><p>Under the heavens,</p><p></p><p>Grand Sect Masters can be counted on one's fingers.</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing considered himself to have exceptional talents, but he did not have the grasp to become a Grand Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Throughout history,</p><p></p><p>Many demonic prodigies have been stuck at the Sect Master realm, without any earth-shattering opportunities, they basically have no chance of becoming Grand Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>These demonic prodigies have chosen to remain at the Sect Master realm, and directly...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Refining evil into the body.</p><p></p><p>It can be said.</p><p></p><p>Refining evil into the body.</p><p></p><p>Is the ultimate path for all martial artists in the world.</p><p></p><p>But the martial cultivation before refining evil into the body is also what determines one's own strength after the refinement.</p><p></p><p>If one can refine evil into the body at the Grand Master realm, then they will be the supreme existence in the world.</p><p></p><p>—— </p><p></p><p>North Gate Pass.</p><p></p><p>The army is stationed.</p><p></p><p>The flags are fluttering.</p><p></p><p>Only to see on top of it is a red "Gu" character, representing the army stationed here, which is called the Gu Family Army.</p><p></p><p>"Report to the lord, the Divine Might Army is only five li away from the North Gate Pass!"</p><p></p><p>"Report to the lord, the Divine Might Army is only three li away from the North Gate Pass!"</p><p></p><p>"Report to the lord—"</p><p></p><p>Messages kept coming, Gu Yang stood on the city wall, his gaze looking forward, where dense black dots had appeared, and as the black dots drew nearer, the hundred thousand-strong army came into view.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Might Army!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang stood with his hands behind his back, his expression more solemn than ever before.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Divine Might Army has not yet truly arrived in front of the North Gate Pass, he could already feel that aura of iron and blood killing, which can only be honed through the baptism of blood.</p><p></p><p>In comparison.</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family Army lacked this iron and blood killing.</p><p></p><p>"Lord, the secret guard reports that there are three Elders of the Solar Sword Sect among the Divine Might Army, all of whom are at least at the Sect Master level!"</p><p></p><p>Next to Gu Yang, Gu Yi said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Three Sect Masters!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Normally, three Sect Masters should make him wary, but thinking of Gu Qingfeng, he felt at ease.</p><p></p><p>Even before Gu Yang led the army to the North Gate Pass, he had already instructed the secret guard to inform Gu Qingfeng, and unexpectedly, his father might also be arriving soon.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Solar Sword Sect has three Sect Masters present, he might not necessarily lose this battle.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Might Army has arrived.</p><p></p><p>The hundred thousand-strong army was silent, Pei Jing looked at the figures on the city wall and shouted loudly, "Gu Yang, if you surrender now, my king can still spare your life."</p><p></p><p>"But if you stubbornly resist, when the city falls, it will be the end of you!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang sneered contemptuously, then shouted, "I would also advise you, if you lead your troops to retreat now, I can pretend that nothing has happened."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, once the Divine Might Army attacks the city, I'm afraid your Divine Might King will be staying here forever!"</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant wretch!"</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing heard this, his expression turned cold, then he waved his hand widely.</p><p></p><p>"Attack the city!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell.</p><p></p><p>The hundred thousand Divine Might Army immediately set out.</p><p></p><p>The infantry in the front held up their shields and advanced towards the North Gate Pass, while the archers behind them provided cover fire to create opportunities for the infantry.</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang also waved his hand widely.</p><p></p><p>"Fire the arrows!"</p><p></p><p>With the order given.</p><p></p><p>Arrows rained down like a waterfall, falling upon the Divine Might Army.</p><p></p><p>At that moment.</p><p></p><p>The battlefield was filled with flying arrows.</p><p></p><p>After the first exchange, both sides had already suffered numerous casualties.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang drew the long sword at his waist, the chilling sword light swaying, all the arrows coming towards him were shattered by the sword qi, not harming him in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after.</p><p></p><p>Siege ladders were also set up, and a group of Divine Might soldiers began to climb the ladders, trying to scale the city wall.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, all the cultivators at the Blood Refining Realm and above appeared, directly destroying the siege ladders to block these soldiers from reaching the top.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

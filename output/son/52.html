        <h1>Chapter 52</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Refining evil into the body! </p><p></p><p>This was something that Gu Qingfeng could not tolerate.</p><p></p><p>The powerful cultivator from the Exorcism Bureau was the first sorcerer that Gu Qingfeng had encountered.</p><p></p><p>He still vividly remembered the other party's techniques.</p><p></p><p>Once evil was refined into the body, in a certain sense, one would no longer be considered human, but would be no different from an evil spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Now that I have figured out the strength of the Qingyang Sect, this matter can no longer be delayed!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes turned cold.</p><p></p><p>The first to strike wins, the latter is the loser. Since he had already offended the Qingyang Sect, he must completely annihilate them.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the situation will only become more troublesome.</p><p></p><p>However, before dealing with the Qingyang Sect, Gu Qingfeng still needed to make another preparation.</p><p></p><p>"Summon someone!"</p><p></p><p>"Master, what are your orders?"</p><p></p><p>A servant came in.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "Immediately summon Meng Peng to see me."</p><p></p><p>"Understood, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>The servant immediately withdrew, and in less than an hour, Meng Peng hurriedly arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Master has summoned your subordinate, is there anything you need to instruct?"</p><p></p><p>"I have a task for you to do--"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's voice suddenly lowered, and after a while, Meng Peng nodded slightly, then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>The next day, in the Gu family's training ground, three hundred elite guards gathered there. These three hundred guards were the strongest among all the guards, with the weakest being at the Refining Skin Realm, and there were five Refining Blood Realm experts leading them.</p><p></p><p>The many Gu family guards were silent, an aura of ruthlessness permeating the air, their gazes all focused on the figure in front of them, filled with reverence.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng spoke, "I won't say much in formalities, you all know the purpose for which I have summoned you."</p><p></p><p>"I also know the purpose for which you have joined the Gu family."</p><p></p><p>"As long as you annihilate the Qingyang Sect, Refining Skin Realm warriors can obtain a mid-grade martial art, Refining Blood Realm warriors can obtain a high-grade martial art, and the Gu family will not withhold any corresponding cultivation resources from you!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, the expressions of the crowd immediately became fervent.</p><p></p><p>Mid-grade martial art!</p><p>High-grade martial art!</p><p></p><p>Their purpose in joining the Gu family was to have the opportunity to learn advanced martial arts and further their own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Now, Gu Qingfeng had directly offered such temptations, naturally exciting them greatly.</p><p></p><p>"Swear to annihilate the Qingyang Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Someone suddenly shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, the emotions of the entire venue were also ignited.</p><p></p><p>"Swear to annihilate the Qingyang Sect!"</p><p>"Swear to annihilate the Qingyang Sect!!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Qingfeng's eyes showed a satisfied expression.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, as long as the benefits are great enough, even if it means going through fire and sword, there will still be people willing to do it.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary warriors, even if they exhaust all their efforts, they may not necessarily be able to obtain a mid-grade martial art, let alone a high-grade martial art.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Meng Peng also arrived.</p><p></p><p>"How did it go?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng glanced at him.</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng nodded and said in a low voice, "Everything has been prepared as the master has instructed!"</p><p></p><p>"Good--"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes were filled with murderous intent, and he immediately waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Depart!"</p><p></p><p>At the order, the three hundred guards all moved.</p><p></p><p>However, just as Gu Qingfeng was about to step out of the Gu family gate, Xu Yulan walked over, followed by two maids, and she was holding a baby in her arms.</p><p></p><p>"Husband!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yulan</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was filled with concern.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression softened a bit, and then he said, "If this battle goes smoothly, that would be the best. If I don't come back within ten days, you should take the two children and leave this place first, heading to the next resting point according to what I told you before. At that time, I will come and meet up with you!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay, my husband, please be careful!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yulan's lips moved slightly, but in the end, she didn't say much, just nodding her head.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the two maids behind him and said in a deep voice, "You must take good care of the madam. If you are negligent, the punishment will not be simple."</p><p></p><p>"Master, don't worry, we understand!" </p><p></p><p>The two maids hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at Xu Yulan one more time, then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Outside the city gate.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had already prepared three hundred horses.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng was seen leading people out of the city, with a carriage in the middle.</p><p></p><p>Outside the city gate.</p><p></p><p>All the guards mounted their horses and headed towards the Qingyang Sect in a grand manner.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Qingyang Sect.</p><p></p><p>The news of the deaths of King Xue and the others was also transmitted back.</p><p></p><p>When Sect Master Ye Nanshou learned of this news, his face was filled with furious anger.</p><p></p><p>"How dare the Gu family have such audacity to kill the people of my Qingyang Sect!!"</p><p></p><p>The death of King Xue was just a death.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>The death of Ye Shi was truly what made Ye Nanshou feel heartbroken.</p><p></p><p>From the outside, Ye Nanshou, although his temples were slightly graying, still looked like a middle-aged man, not too old. In reality, he was already over ninety years old.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nanshou had a late-life child.</p><p></p><p>It was only when he was over sixty that he miraculously had Ye Shi.</p><p></p><p>Since then.</p><p></p><p>Towards this only heir, Ye Nanshou doted on him tremendously, and with Ye Shi's excellent talent, he had already broken through the Blood Refining Intermediate stage at a young age, and it was a foregone conclusion that he would step into the Bone Refining Realm in the future.</p><p></p><p>In Ye Nanshou's eyes, Ye Shi was the next Sect Master of the Qingyang Sect.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>The news of Ye Shi's death had arrived, how could it not make Ye Nanshou furious.</p><p></p><p>Immediately.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nanshou wanted to gather all the powerful cultivators of the Qingyang Sect and go to Baishi City to completely eradicate the Gu family, burying them with Ye Shi.</p><p></p><p>"What is making you so furious?" </p><p></p><p>A cold voice came.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nanshou looked up and saw the Qingyang Ancestor had appeared in the main hall without him noticing.</p><p></p><p>He immediately changed his expression and hurriedly stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, how did the task I assigned you go?" </p><p></p><p>The Qingyang Ancestor walked slowly to the main seat and sat down, his gaze towards Ye Nanshou somewhat cold.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the latter felt immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>"Originally, Ancestor instructed me to have Elder Xue Wang lead two of my direct disciples to Baishi Road to prepare three thousand boys and girls.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, the Gu family didn't give my Qingyang Sect any face at all, including Elder Xue Wang and my son Ye Shi, the three of them all perished at the hands of the Gu family!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Nanshou gritted his teeth as he spoke the last part.</p><p></p><p>"The Gu family!" </p><p></p><p>Green light flickered in the Qingyang Ancestor's eyes, and a sinister aura seemed to permeate around him, his shadow lengthening and twisting, giving a sense of eerie foreboding.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Xue Wang, I remember he had already reached the Bone Refining Realm for many years. For the Gu family to be able to kill him, it seems their strength is also not simple.</p><p></p><p>But this is also good, it means the Gu family at least has one Silver Bone cultivator guarding them.</p><p></p><p>If we don't have the boys and girls, refining a Silver Bone cultivator will also be not bad!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this.</p><p></p><p>The Qingyang Ancestor paused for a moment, then continued.</p><p></p><p>"This time, I will personally take action. You arrange some people to follow me to the Gu family, I want to make sure not even a chicken or dog is left in the Gu family!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

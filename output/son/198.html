        <h1>Chapter 198</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain 786 rebel soldiers!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by rebel forces 365 times!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by the imperial court 296 times!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by 6 Refining Impurity Realm cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has gained some insights in battle, and his strength has slightly improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been instructed by a Grand Dao Master, and his strength has improved!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While Gu Qingfeng was contemplating the Unextinguished Dao Blade, he also saw the text on the information panel constantly updating.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, intelligence regarding Nanyang Prefecture was continuously being transmitted to him by his secret agents.</p><p></p><p>He was aware of the current situation where Gu Yang was besieged by rebel forces and the imperial army at the Tianyang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>However, he was not overly concerned.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Tianyang Sword Sect was situated in a treacherous location, and Gu Yang had the support of powerful cultivators from the Shenwu Sect, which could hold out for a while.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was also prepared, as the Guangyang Army was constantly marching towards the Tianyang Sword Sect. Once the main force arrived, all the troubles would be resolved.</p><p></p><p>This was the reason why Gu Qingfeng did not personally intervene.</p><p></p><p>Given Gu Yang's foundation, this battle was bound to be a success without any major issues. Those who sought to dominate the world should rely on their own strength to solve problems. Gu Qingfeng would only personally intervene if an irresistible force appeared.</p><p></p><p>At other times, he would let Gu Yang grow on his own.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, flowers grown in a greenhouse ultimately have no great use.</p><p></p><p>However, at least until now, Gu Yang had not disappointed Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>The only thing that surprised him was the appearance of a Grand Dao Master.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Dao Masters are extremely rare in the world, and many immortal sects and families are secretly watching them. Even if a true Grand Dao Master existed, they might not dare to reveal themselves openly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in a mere Nanyang Prefecture, where could a Grand Dao Master come from..."</p><p></p><p>This thought had just emerged when Gu Qingfeng considered other possibilities.</p><p></p><p>If Nanyang Prefecture was destined to produce a Grand Dao Master, it would most likely be a sword cultivator.</p><p></p><p>From the previous battle at Xueshan Prefecture, Gu Qingfeng could see that sword cultivators were only a step away from the Grand Dao Master realm, which was why he had bestowed the Longevity Sutra upon them.</p><p></p><p>Now that a mysterious Grand Dao Master had intervened to rescue Gu Yang, this Grand Dao Master was most likely a sword cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"It seems this person has excellent natural talent, to have advanced to the Grand Dao Master realm so quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng mused.</p><p></p><p>With the appearance of a Grand Dao Master, Gu Qingfeng had even less to worry about.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, he resumed his contemplation of the Unextinguished Dao Blade.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Blade that Gu Qingfeng had created in the past was a fusion of various true essence blade techniques and Grand Master's secret arts, ultimately combining them into a supreme martial art that surpassed the Grand Master realm.</p><p></p><p>But strictly speaking, the Heavenly Blade had only just reached the threshold of the Grand Dao Master realm.</p><p></p><p>However, now, with the comprehension of the Unextinguished Dao Blade, Gu Qingfeng could see an even more advanced path.</p><p></p><p>Imperceptibly, the aura of his blade intent had become more refined, with a terrifying presence permeating the Whetstone Hall, causing the various divine weapons to tremble, as if they were all submitting to him.</p><p></p><p>While Gu Qingfeng was in seclusion, the situation in Nanyang Prefecture was also changing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has defeated the imperial army, and his prestige has greatly increased!"</p><p></p><p>"The Guangyang Army led by your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been unstoppable, and many enemy armies have surrendered wherever they went!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by 36 Refining Impurity Realm cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by 6 Grand Master realm cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by 5 Fusing Spirit Realm spell casters!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has exterminated 3 thousand-year-old families!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has subdued the entire Nanyang Prefecture, and his forces have greatly expanded!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has broken through to the next stage of the Refining Blood Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 20 Attribute Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has broken through to the next stage of the Refining Blood Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 20 Attribute Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Shengnan' has been purified by a Grand Master realm cultivator, and her cultivation has broken through to the next stage of the Refining Skin Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 5 Attribute Points!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>This year, Gu Qingfeng was 44 years old.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu were both 8 years old, and they had simultaneously broken through to the next stage of the Refining Blood Realm. Gu Shengnan, who was just over 3 years old, had been tempered by a Grand Master's true qi, and she had also passively broken through to the next stage of the Refining Skin Realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was not particularly surprised by their breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>After all, during this period, Gu Yang had already subdued the entire Nanyang Prefecture, and he now controlled two prefectures.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the Gu Family Manor had become an existence that transcended the mundane world.</p><p></p><p>The resources from the two prefectures were constantly flowing into the Gu Family Manor, and Gu Xuan and the others lacked nothing in their cultivation resources. Combined with their inherent talent, their cultivation breakthroughs were only natural.</p><p></p><p>However, it was also in this year that...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Having successfully deduced the Purification Scriptures of the Longevity Sutra, the Longevity Sutra is now truly complete in its entirety.</p><p></p><p>"This world's martial dao is flawed, so martial practitioners are inferior to sorcerers, let alone evil spirits. But with the Longevity Sutra's Purification Scriptures fully deduced, the flawed martial dao has finally been completely repaired."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, the so-called defects no longer exist!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled slightly, feeling a sense of pride in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Unlike other martial arts, this martial art was one that he had truly deduced through his own methods. The five volumes of the Longevity Sutra's Body Refining are sufficient to allow martial practitioners to truly transcend the mundane and transform their life realms to higher levels.</p><p></p><p>The mythical legends of undefeatable evil spirits will also be thoroughly shattered.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng can assert that once the Longevity Sutra spreads out, it will become the most important foundation for all martial practitioners in the world.</p><p></p><p>As for the Purification Scriptures afterwards, the realm of Grandmaster, it will depend on how each individual chooses to walk their path.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Longevity Sutra that Gu Qingfeng has now deduced provides an opportunity for the world to build a perfect foundation. How far one can go afterwards is entirely dependent on their own destiny.</p><p></p><p>But one thing is certain.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng can assert that as long as one successfully completes the Purification Scriptures, as long as one's talent is not too poor, then reaching the realm of Qi and Blood Grandmaster will be as easy as turning one's hand over. And if one can advance even further to achieve the Extreme Dao Grandmaster realm, it is not entirely impossible either.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Gu Qingfeng came out of seclusion and summoned all the middle and high-level members of the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>Led by Gu Peng, everyone had an expression of reverence.</p><p></p><p>The so-called middle and high-level members of the Gu Family Manor were either those who had followed the Gu Family from the very beginning, gradually gaining power as the Gu Family Manor was established. Or they were those who had heard of the Gu Family Manor's reputation and directly came to join, passing examinations and tests to confirm their loyalty, and were then granted corresponding authority.</p><p></p><p>But strictly speaking, the true high-level members were only Gu Peng.</p><p></p><p>There's no help for it.</p><p></p><p>The foundation of the Gu Family Manor is ultimately shallow, and the next generation has not yet fully matured. In this vast Gu Family Manor, only Gu Peng, who was granted the Gu surname, can be presented.</p><p></p><p>Now, many people were looking at Gu Qingfeng with reverence in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>These people were naturally no strangers to this Patriarch who shook the world. The reason they joined the Gu Family Manor and have been loyal all along was precisely because of his existence.</p><p></p><p>It's just that in the past, Gu Qingfeng was mostly in seclusion and rarely appeared before the crowd, so this summons of these people has not only excited them, but also made them quite curious.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the changes in everyone's expressions, Gu Qingfeng said indifferently, "Evil spirits run rampant in the world, sorcerers wreak havoc, and it is only we martial practitioners who are weak. At the root of it all is the fact that the martial dao in this world is flawed, making it difficult for martial practitioners to achieve longevity!"</p><p></p><p>"Now, I have been in seclusion for many years, observing the martial arts of the world, and have finally managed to fill the gaps in the martial dao, creating the Longevity Sutra, laying a foundation for our martial dao."</p><p></p><p>"Today, I shall impart the Longevity Sutra to all of you. I hope you will cultivate it diligently and not tarnish the reputation of the Gu Family Manor!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's words fell upon the ears of the crowd like a heavy bomb, causing them to become dazed, as if they were unsure if they had heard correctly.</p><p></p><p>Flawed martial dao! Longevity Sutra!</p><p></p><p>The information contained in Gu Qingfeng's brief words had caused an unprecedented impact on them.</p><p></p><p>The only one who remained calm was Gu Peng.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Peng had already obtained the flawed Longevity Sutra, so he was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>Just as the crowd was still in shock, a terrifying true essence aura began to emanate from Gu Qingfeng, exerting a powerful pressure over the entire hall.</p><p></p><p>Under this true essence pressure, everyone felt their bodies trembling, and their qi and blood became stagnant, their faces filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>However, before they could be shocked any further, Gu Qingfeng pointed a finger, and all the cultivation methods of the Longevity Sutra flooded into the minds of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Including Gu Peng, they all received the complete cultivation methods of the Longevity Sutra.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a large amount of information surged, causing the entire hall to fall into an eerie silence.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Gu Peng was the first to regain his senses. He bowed deeply to Gu Qingfeng and said, "Thank you, Patriarch, for bestowing this law upon us. Your subordinate is deeply grateful!"</p><p></p><p>The complete Longevity Sutra was far more profound and powerful than the flawed version he had obtained earlier.</p><p></p><p>Even with Gu Peng's current temperament, his heart could not help but feel excited.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng handed a book to Gu Peng.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Longevity Sutra I have compiled. You shall make this martial art the foundation for all outer disciples. All martial arts below the Grandmaster realm shall be primarily based on the Longevity Sutra."</p><p></p><p>"But without my order, no one is allowed to leak the Longevity Sutra outside. If I ever find out, the consequences will be clear to you all!"</p><p></p><p>As Gu Qingfeng spoke the last part, a powerful aura emanated from him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng hurriedly accepted the Longevity Sutra with both hands and said anxiously, "Patriarch, rest assured. Whoever dares to reveal the secrets of the Longevity Sutra, your subordinate will ensure they can neither live nor die!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the other people also regained their senses and hurriedly bowed, saying, "Patriarch, rest assured. If anyone leaks the Longevity Sutra, we your subordinates will never forgive them!"</p>

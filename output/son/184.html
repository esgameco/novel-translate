        <h1>Chapter 184</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Have you investigated the identities of those three Xiantian Sect Masters clearly?"</p><p></p><p>On the city wall, Gu Yang's clothes were stained with blood as he looked at the numerous corpses being transported below, his brow furrowed with a cold expression.</p><p></p><p>Attacking Nanyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The million-strong army could not be integrated into one. </p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>This battle was divided into six routes.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang himself led one of the main armies, charging directly into the heartland of Nanyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>But the consequences of doing so were also quite severe.</p><p></p><p>Many forces of Nanyang Prefecture fought back fiercely, making every step of the Guangyang Army's advance fraught with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Even Gu Yang, who was commanding the main force, had no choice but to take the field and slay the enemy.</p><p></p><p>By now,</p><p></p><p>He had even forgotten how many soldiers he had slain.</p><p></p><p>The soldiers killed by Gu Yang's hand came from the imperial court, as well as other rebel armies and aristocratic sects.</p><p></p><p>Among them,</p><p></p><p>There were even several Xiantian Sect Masters who attacked.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the elite bodyguards constantly vigilant, they might have succeeded.</p><p></p><p>Behind him,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi's expression was icy cold as he said in a deep voice, "The identities of the three have been investigated clearly - one is from the Tianyang Sword Sect, one is from the Yin Family, and the last one is from the Yueling Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was not surprised that the Tianyang Sword Sect had intervened.</p><p></p><p>But when he heard the names of the other two forces, his expression clearly grew colder.</p><p></p><p>"The Yin Family... the Yueling Sect... I remember both of these forces have Fushen Realm experts leading them, don't they?"</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty is correct. According to the information obtained by my bodyguards, the Yin Family now has three Fushen Realm experts, while the Yueling Sect has four Fushen Realm experts!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi nodded in response.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang nodded slightly, then spoke, "Summon Gu Yun to see me."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In less than a moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun arrived upon hearing the summons.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>This Shenwu Sect Master also had an aura of bloody slaughter about him, indicating he had just been through a fierce battle.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said, "The identities of the three Xiantian Sect Masters who attacked me have been investigated - one is from the Tianyang Sword Sect, and the other two are from the Yin Family and the Yueling Sect respectively."</p><p></p><p>"I want you to lead the experts of the Shenwu Sect to exterminate the Yin Family and the Yueling Sect, leaving not a single one alive!"</p><p></p><p>As Gu Yang spoke the last words, his expression was filled with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>Wiping out sects and families.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang did not want to do this.</p><p></p><p>After all, things had not reached that point yet. If he acted rashly, it would only make the major sects and families resist the Guangyang Army even more.</p><p></p><p>But the Yin Family and the Yueling Sect dared to make a move, so Gu Yang naturally would not continue to be polite.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun clasped his fists and said, "Your Majesty, rest assured. In the face of my Shenwu Sect, the Yin Family and the Yueling Sect are nothing but a minor disturbance.</p><p></p><p>Within ten days, I will definitely bring the heads of the leaders of these two families before you!"</p><p></p><p>As Gu Yun's words fell, Gu Yang's gaze locked onto him, his expression more solemn than ever before.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, I want all the people of the Yin Family and the Yueling Sect eliminated, not a single one left!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun's heart trembled, and he instinctively bowed his head in response.</p><p></p><p>After Gu Yang left, Gu Yun let out a long sigh, his expression somewhat complex.</p><p></p><p>"His murderous intent and majesty have only grown stronger. The later waves push the earlier ones, I'm getting old!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yangyi was stunned into silence, while Gu Yun let out a self-mocking laugh.</p><p></p><p>He was the mighty Sect Master of the Divine Martial Sect, yet he had been intimidated by a junior. This was truly embarrassing for him.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Yun did not pay it much mind.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was no ordinary junior - he was the Prince of Guangyang, commanding an army of millions, his hands stained with the blood of countless martial artists. He was not someone that others could compare to.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Gu Yun summoned the powerful experts of the Divine Martial Sect, and then led an army of ten thousand to march towards the Yin Clan.</p><p></p><p>The two great sects could not afford to attack separately - they would first eliminate the Yin Clan, and then turn their attention to the Moon Spirit Sect.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Grand Hall of the Taiyang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere was oppressively gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Sitting on the former Sect Master's seat was a different person - the Vice Sect Master of the Taiyang Sword Sect, Gu Shentong. However, the title of Vice Sect Master was now a thing of the past.</p><p></p><p>After the previous Sect Master, Gu Tian, had fallen, Gu Shentong had ascended to become the new Sect Master, overseeing all affairs of the Taiyang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Below, an Elder of the Taiyang Sword Sect spoke in a grave tone: "Sect Master, the Guangyang Army is approaching with great force. Not only does Gu Yang have the mysterious 'Dark Guards' under his command, but he is also backed by the Divine Martial Sect's protectors. It will not be easy to assassinate him.</p><p></p><p>If we cannot stop the Guangyang Army, I fear the millennia-old legacy of our Taiyang Sword Sect will be completely destroyed!"</p><p></p><p>"Since Gu Yang does not give us a chance to live, we might as well fight them to the death!" shouted another.</p><p></p><p>However, someone soon shook their head, pouring cold water on their enthusiasm.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Yang commands an army of millions, with the Divine Martial Sect backing him, and he even has the support of that Martial Saint from the imperial court. What do we have to fight them with?"</p><p></p><p>These words silenced the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, what did they have to fight with? Even at the peak of their power, the Taiyang Sword Sect would be no match for that Martial Saint, let alone in their current weakened state.</p><p></p><p>If they were to go up against Gu Yang, they would need the strength to do so.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the heated discussion below, Gu Shentong raised his hand, and the hall fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Yang has always harbored prejudice against our sect of cultivators. Since he rose to power, countless sects and families have been destroyed by his hand. That Martial Saint has also strictly forbidden cultivators from entering Guangyang Prefecture, which speaks volumes."</p><p></p><p>"Even if the Taiyang Sword Sect allies with Gu Yang, that Martial Saint may not necessarily accept us. At best, it would only be a superficial acceptance, and our eventual fate would be clear."</p><p></p><p>"The only path before the Taiyang Sword Sect is to crush Gu Yang, and exhaust all our resources to ensure the stability of our sect!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Shentong's words caused the expressions of the others to shift, as they pondered his words.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, an Elder asked respectfully, "Sect Master, what is your plan?"</p><p></p><p>"Send orders to the Fei Clan, have them cooperate with the Taiyang Sword Sect's actions. Dispatch a large army to sacrifice the common people of the cities, to help me ascend to the Transformation Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Also, send people to the Blood Mountain Prefecture to sacrifice living beings, and awaken the evil entity that lies sealed there!"</p><p></p><p>"Since Gu Yang does not give us a path to survive, then we shall not hold back. Even if we have to abandon Nanyang Prefecture, as long as we live, the legacy of the Taiyang Sword Sect will not be extinguished!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Shentong spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>At these words, all present were struck with horror on their faces.

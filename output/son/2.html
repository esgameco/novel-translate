        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>On a small plot of land in Linxian County, it could be considered a sizable force.</p><p></p><p>The head of the martial arts school was named Xu Jun, who was a cultivator who had reached the peak of leather refinement, and then there were a group of high-level leather refinement instructors.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng's strength was not too high, he had already entered the middle stage of leather refinement, meeting the requirements to join the Golden Bull Martial Arts School.</p><p></p><p>So, after demonstrating his own strength, it was only natural for him to become an instructor.</p><p></p><p>"The salary for a regular instructor is five taels of silver per month. I assume that won't be a problem for Instructor Gu, right?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Jun chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded, "No problem!"</p><p></p><p>Five taels of silver was not a small amount.</p><p></p><p>In Linxian County, for an ordinary family of three, five taels of silver per year would be more than enough for their expenses.</p><p></p><p>This was the difference between a cultivator and an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>Even at the middle stage of leather refinement, the treatment received was far beyond what ordinary people could compare to.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the two parties signed the contract.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng became a regular instructor at the Golden Bull Martial Arts School, with a monthly salary of five taels of silver, but he was required to guide disciples in cultivation for at least 20 days per month, with a minimum of 4 hours per day. </p><p></p><p>If he failed to meet this requirement, the Golden Bull Martial Arts School had the right to deduct his monthly salary.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had no objections to this.</p><p></p><p>Five taels of silver was more than enough to support a child, and he could even afford to hire a wet nurse without any problems.</p><p></p><p>But considering his current financial difficulties, Gu Qingfeng wanted to receive the first month's salary upfront, to which Xu Jun did not refuse.</p><p></p><p>After receiving the silver, Gu Qingfeng first used one tael of silver per month to hire a wet nurse who had recently given birth and had sufficient milk to nurse the child.</p><p></p><p>The wet nurse was a woman in her thirties, still youthful and attractive, but her complexion was a bit pale, indicating some nutritional deficiency. However, upon hearing the high price of one tael of silver, her face became much more radiant.</p><p></p><p>With everything arranged, Gu Qingfeng's life was back on track.</p><p></p><p>He cultivated daily, and then waited patiently for Gu Yang to grow up, hoping to have another chance to trigger a reward.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Gu Qingfeng had the idea of remarrying and having more children, but the cost of taking a wife was not low, and if he had to raise several more children, he might not have the means to do so.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, when it came to taking a wife, Gu Qingfeng hoped to find someone he had a connection with.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would be like becoming a mere puppet for reproduction, which was not what he desired.</p><p></p><p>At least for now, Gu Qingfeng did not have such thoughts.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flew by.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, seven years had passed.</p><p></p><p>These seven years had made Gu Qingfeng more mature, and he was now 29 years old, just one step away from entering his thirties.</p><p></p><p>Two years earlier, Gu Qingfeng had already cultivated the Collapse Mountain Fist to the peak, breaking through to the advanced stage of leather refinement.</p><p></p><p>It was not because his talent had improved, but because he had refined a blood-refining dan and subsequently used his monthly salary to purchase various cultivation resources, which allowed him to achieve this breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>When his cultivation reached the advanced stage of leather refinement, Gu Qingfeng's status at the Golden Bull Martial Arts School also rose, directly promoted from a regular instructor to a senior instructor.</p><p></p><p>His monthly salary also increased from five taels of silver to ten taels of silver.</p><p></p><p>This monthly salary, if he could maintain it for a few years, would be more than enough for an ordinary person to enjoy a comfortable retirement.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, as a cultivator...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng earned money quickly, but he also spent it just as quickly. Over the years, he had not saved up much silver.</p><p></p><p>However, the courtyard he had previously rented, Gu Qingfeng had directly bought it in a lump sum a few years ago, making it his true foundation in Linxian County.</p><p></p><p>After finishing a set of fist techniques, Gu Qingfeng stopped his movements, allowing the surging qi and blood to gradually subside. At this time, he saw a half-grown child coming back from outside.</p><p></p><p>The other party had a clean and bright appearance, with clear and bright eyes, and there was a certain resemblance to Gu Qingfeng in his brows and eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>"Why are you back so early today?"</p><p></p><p>"The teacher had some matters to attend to, so he dismissed the class early today!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly, and then he looked at his son in front of him. At only seven years old, due to the lack of nutritional deficiencies from a young age, he was much more robust than ordinary children.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Qingfeng spoke: "You've come at the right time. You are now seven years old, which is the stage to lay a foundation. Today, Father will teach you martial arts and see if you have any talent in this area."</p><p></p><p>"Really?" Gu Yang's eyes suddenly lit up. Since he was young, he had watched Gu Qingfeng practice martial arts, and he knew that his father was a senior instructor at the Jinniu Martial Arts Hall, a well-known expert in Linxian County. Gu Yang had previously expressed the desire to practice martial arts, but was always rejected by Gu Qingfeng on the grounds that he was too young. Now that Gu Qingfeng had taken the initiative to mention it, Gu Yang was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Teaching Gu Yang to practice fist techniques was not a difficult task for Gu Qingfeng. After teaching apprentices in the martial arts hall for several years and having cultivated the Beng Mountain Fist to a high level, teaching a seven-year-old child was an easy task.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had prepared to use sticks and clubs, thinking that Gu Yang, being young, would find the practice arduous and have difficulty persisting for long. However, to his surprise, although Gu Yang was young, his perseverance was not lacking at all. No matter how difficult the fist practice was, Gu Yang stubbornly persisted.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the way of the martial arts, Gu Qingfeng found that Gu Yang's talent was far superior to his own. It had taken Gu Qingfeng several years of arduous cultivation to barely enter the Beng Mountain Fist, but Gu Yang had succeeded in cultivating the Beng Mountain Fist to the initial stage in less than three months, breaking through to the Refining Skin Realm.</p><p></p><p>At the moment Gu Yang broke through, Gu Qingfeng's long-dormant information panel finally displayed new messages:</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has broken through to the initial stage of the Refining Skin Realm!"</p><p>"Reward: 1 Promotion Point!"</p><p>"Reward: 20 Blood Qi Pills!"</p><p>"Reward: Low-Grade Martial Art 'Iron Body Technique'!"</p><p></p><p>This reward was much more generous than the previous one. In addition to the Promotion Point, the number of Blood Qi Pills had doubled, and a low-grade martial art, the Iron Body Technique, had also been awarded.</p><p></p><p>So-called low-grade martial arts were entry-level martial arts. The Beng Mountain Fist that Gu Qingfeng cultivated was a type of low-grade martial art.</p><p></p><p>But even low-grade martial arts were precious treasures that were difficult for many people to obtain, requiring joining a martial arts hall and paying a large amount of silver to have the opportunity to learn them.</p><p></p><p>Now, a single reward had provided a low-grade martial art, which naturally made Gu Qingfeng very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, through this experience, Gu Qingfeng had completely grasped how to trigger his attribute panel. As long as his offspring's cultivation advanced, he would receive corresponding rewards.</p><p></p><p>Now that Gu Yang had broken through to the initial stage of the Refining Skin Realm, the rewards were so generous. In the future, as Gu Yang advanced to higher realms, the rewards would only get better.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

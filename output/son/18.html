        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Raging blood and billowing smoke!"</p><p></p><p>"When did White Stone Dao produce such a powerful expert!"</p><p></p><p>The remaining five cultivators at the Blood Refining Realm were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>Raging blood and billowing smoke!</p><p></p><p>This is a manifestation that can only be achieved by cultivators at the Blood Refining Realm after reaching a certain level.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of raging blood and billowing smoke is not related to the cultivator's level in the Blood Refining Realm, it can only occur when one's qi and blood have been refined to an even higher realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, </p><p></p><p>raging blood and billowing smoke represents potential and unrivaled combat prowess within the same realm.</p><p></p><p>If a cultivator at the initial stage of Blood Refining could achieve this, even mid-stage Blood Refining cultivators would not be their match.</p><p></p><p>However, </p><p></p><p>raging blood and billowing smoke is extremely difficult to cultivate. </p><p></p><p>Throughout the entire White Stone Dao, there has not been a single person who has reached this level.</p><p></p><p>The sudden appearance of such a powerful expert wielding raging blood and billowing smoke naturally shocked them greatly.</p><p></p><p>But,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not give them any chance to catch their breath. After swiftly killing one Blood Refining cultivator, he charged towards another.</p><p></p><p>That person hurriedly tried to mobilize his own power, attempting to block Gu Qingfeng's attack with his arm.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately,</p><p></p><p>the gap in their strengths was too great. </p><p></p><p>With just one punch, Gu Qingfeng shattered the opponent's arm into several pieces, exposing the broken bones and flesh, eliciting a piercing scream of agony from him.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh—"</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>the scream was abruptly cut short, for Gu Qingfeng had already punched his head into oblivion.</p><p></p><p>The headless corpse twitched a few times before falling silent.</p><p></p><p>It was only at this moment </p><p></p><p>that the remaining cultivators truly reacted.</p><p></p><p>"This person is ruthless, we must join forces to subdue him!"</p><p></p><p>One of the Blood Refining cultivators spoke in a cold voice, and the others did not object, instead rushing towards Gu Qingfeng with all their might.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's lightning-fast slaughter of two Blood Refining cultivators had left them greatly alarmed by his exposed strength.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the four Blood Refining cultivators charging at him, Gu Qingfeng's eyes burned with battle intent, and his qi and blood began to boil, especially with the lingering scent of blood in the air, which seemed to excite him.</p><p></p><p>Kill!</p><p></p><p>Without any further words,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng poured out all his cultivation, and the surging qi and blood transformed into a billowing blood mist. Each of his punches carried tremendous force, and his bare hands were comparable to divine weapons, causing the four Blood Refining cultivators to be greatly terrified.</p><p></p><p>In a brief moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng crushed a long sword with his bare hands, and with a single finger, he pierced through the throat of a Blood Refining cultivator before his horrified gaze. The latter clutched his throat, stumbled, and soon perished.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng struck out with a palm like a fan, a blow powerful enough to shatter rocks, slamming into another Blood Refining cultivator and tearing his body into pieces, scattering the bloody remains.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>the remaining two Blood Refining cultivators could no longer suppress their fear and hastily retreated without looking back.</p><p></p><p>"Thinking of leaving now is far too late!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng let out a loud laugh, the thrill of the slaughter making his eyes turn crimson. The surging blood qi gathered in his legs, and he soared into the air, delivering a whip-like kick to the back of one of the fleeing Blood Refining cultivators, causing him to cough up a mouthful of blood and lose his face mask.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing the cultivator's true face, those who had been secretly observing, hoping to reap the benefits, all changed color.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Yuanhao!"</p><p></p><p>The person was the Hall Master of the Iron Bone Sect's Divine Skill Hall, a top-tier cultivator who had reached the advanced stage of Blood Refining.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Strong One.</p><p></p><p>But now, the opponent's spine was broken, the entire person collapsed on the ground, blood flowing from the seven orifices, and he was also vomiting large mouthfuls of fresh blood, mixed with fragments of internal organs, clearly beyond saving.</p><p></p><p>After slaying司元昊, Gu Qingfeng also kicked several broken stones, directly hitting the legs of another martial artist, causing him to let out a miserable scream and collapse to the ground.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Gu Qingfeng had taken three steps in two, raised his fist and was about to strike down.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the person was filled with terror and said, "Don't kill me, I am from the Qin family—"</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, Gu Qingfeng's fist had already landed on the opponent's throat, cutting off his voice, and he died on the spot.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Gu Qingfeng returned to his original place, grabbing the blood-stained brocade box.</p><p></p><p>Opening the brocade box, it contained a martial art called the Scorching Sun Divine Palm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng put it in his bosom and then drifted away.</p><p></p><p>It was not until he had left for a while that the others dared to come out from the shadows.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the gruesome scene and the many dead Refining Blood Realm experts, many people had an expression of lingering fear on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Bloody and tumultuous!"</p><p></p><p>"To slay six Refining Blood Realm martial artists with one's own power, and among them was a Sect Master of the Iron Bone Gang's Divine Skill Hall, what a ruthless person is this?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Slaying six Refining Blood Realm experts, and among them, two were at the advanced Refining Blood Realm, the opponent's strength must have reached the peak of the Refining Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could they have accomplished this?</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, someone removed the face veils of the remaining dead, immediately causing an uproar.</p><p></p><p>Elders of the Qin family! The Sect Master of the Iron Bone Gang! Among the six Refining Blood Realm martial artists, the weakest had already reached the middle Refining Blood Realm, and there were even two who had entered the advanced Refining Blood Realm, they were the Elder of the Qin family, Qin Wei, and the Sect Master of the Iron Bone Gang's Divine Skill Hall,司元昊.</p><p></p><p>With such achievements, it was determined that the opponent was a powerful expert at the peak of the Refining Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in such a short time, to have slain so many Refining Blood Realm experts, the opponent must be among the strongest in the peak of the Refining Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The heavens of the White Stone Dao are about to change!" </p><p></p><p>Someone murmured as they looked at the corpses on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Any Refining Blood Realm martial artist had a high status in the White Stone Dao, and now more than ten Refining Blood Realm experts had perished here.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the Qin family and the Iron Bone Gang had each lost three Refining Blood Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Even with the foundations of these two major forces, it was likely a heavy blow.</p><p></p><p>Everyone could imagine the upheaval that would soon sweep through the entire White Stone Dao.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The battle outside the White Stone City quickly spread like a hurricane throughout the White Stone Dao world.</p><p></p><p>Many martial artists secretly speculated about the mysterious Refining Blood Realm expert who had intervened, wondering which force they belonged to.</p><p></p><p>However, some also guessed that the opponent might not be from the White Stone Dao.</p><p></p><p>After all, experts who could reach such a realm were renowned figures, and no one's strength could match theirs.</p><p></p><p>But regardless, the moment this news spread, the Qin family and the Iron Bone Gang were furious, and they widely offered a bounty for the mysterious expert, causing a great commotion in the vast White Stone Dao.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

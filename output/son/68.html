        <h1>Chapter 68</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The problems there were resolved, and the subsequent progress was extremely fast.</p><p></p><p>In less than ten days, the Gu Family Manor was completely constructed.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Gu Qingfeng moved his entire family from Baishi City to settle down in the newly built Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>For this reason, Gu Qingfeng also specially held a grand banquet, inviting various forces to attend.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Gu Family was now recognized as the number one force in the Baishi Dao, and even in the entire Guangyang Prefecture, they were renowned.</p><p></p><p>Any forces that got the news would not dare to not show some face to the Gu Family.</p><p></p><p>After three days of bustling activity, the Gu Family Manor returned to tranquility.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, Gu Qingfeng began to carry out sweeping reforms of the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>First, Gu Qingfeng set up the Inner Hall and the Outer Hall.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the Inner Hall was for the core members of the Gu Family, as well as disciples who were granted the Gu surname. Only they could enter the Inner Hall.</p><p></p><p>As for the Outer Hall, it was the place for the original guards, as well as other non-core Gu Family members and disciples who were not granted the Gu surname.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, Gu Yang was appointed as the Hall Master of the Inner Hall, and Meng Peng was appointed as the Hall Master of the Outer Hall.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Gu Qingfeng also established the Law Enforcement Hall, which existed to supervise the entire Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Yang was also appointed as the Hall Master of the Law Enforcement Hall.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Gu Family lacked manpower, and the Law Enforcement Hall was such an important position that Gu Qingfeng naturally could not entrust it to an outsider.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Gu Family was renamed the Gu Family Manor, and Gu Qingfeng changed his family title to Manor Lord.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that the Gu Family truly became a formidable force in the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall of the Gu Family Manor, Gu Qingfeng said, "The Gu Family Manor has temporarily set up the Inner Hall, Outer Hall, and Law Enforcement Hall. The Inner Hall is currently empty, and the focus will be on developing the Outer Hall. If there are talented and loyal people in the Outer Hall, they can be granted the Gu surname and admitted into the Inner Hall."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's gaze fell on Meng Peng and said, "Meng Peng, you have been by my side for nearly ten years, and all these years you have been loyal and dedicated. I have noticed this."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, today I have decided to grant you the Gu surname. Are you willing to accept it?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Meng Peng, now to be called Gu Peng, immediately stood up and bowed deeply to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Manor Lord, for granting me the Gu surname. Your subordinate is willing to devote his life and blood to the Gu Family Manor, until death!"</p><p></p><p>Being granted the Gu surname meant that he could now truly become a member of the Gu Family, with a status and identity that could not be compared to an outsider.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng then said, "The importance of the Outer Hall cannot be overstated. Next, I will grant the Outer Hall six mid-grade martial arts as the foundation. You can also strictly assess the many Gu Family guards who have been incorporated into the Outer Hall."</p><p></p><p>"Among them, all spies from various forces, as well as those with malicious intentions, must be weeded out."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, I will also recruit some orphans or children with good aptitude from various places, and focus on cultivating them."</p><p></p><p>"The only problem the Gu Family Manor currently has is its weak foundation."</p><p></p><p>"If we can recuperate for twenty years, we will definitely not be weaker than the other forces in the Guangyang Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>This was something Gu Qingfeng was absolutely confident about.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng then looked at Gu Yang and said, "The Inner Hall currently has little to do, so you can follow Gu Peng and learn a thing or two. At the same time, you will also be in charge of the Law Enforcement Hall."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The courtroom also needs to be expanded.</p><p></p><p>And some of the rules within the manor, you can formulate them."</p><p></p><p>"I understand, child!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang also nodded.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng briefly explained a few more things, then had the two of them take their leave.</p><p></p><p>He had already conveyed what needed to be conveyed, and now it was time to allow the Gu family manor sufficient time to grow.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>The Demon Suppressing Prison.</p><p></p><p>This was a place specially constructed by Gu Qingfeng, and the entrance to the Demon Suppressing Prison was located in the backyard where he usually cultivated.</p><p></p><p>The entrance was particularly secretive, with a fake mountain mechanism.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the entire Demon Suppressing Prison was constructed with refined iron.</p><p></p><p>In order to ensure the secrecy of the Demon Suppressing Prison, Gu Qingfeng had the craftsmen manufacture the components, and then he personally assembled the entire Demon Suppressing Prison piece by piece, creating a massive prison.</p><p></p><p>This prison was not meant to imprison other things, but to suppress evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>Due to being made of refined iron, the Demon Suppressing Prison was exceptionally sturdy, and even Bone Refining Realm cultivators would find it difficult to break through.</p><p></p><p>To construct this Demon Suppressing Prison, Gu Qingfeng had spent nearly 200,000 taels of silver.</p><p></p><p>But there was no other choice.</p><p></p><p>Evil spirits were a grave matter.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng naturally would not be careless.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the Demon Suppressing Prison, one could see that the left and right sides were embedded with luminous pearls, serving as illumination.</p><p></p><p>Within the Demon Suppressing Prison, there were three golden sarcophagi.</p><p></p><p>One of the golden sarcophagi was slightly larger, while the other two were a bit smaller.</p><p></p><p>The larger golden sarcophagus contained the sealed Yin Gui, while the other two smaller golden sarcophagi were temporarily constructed by Gu Qingfeng, prepared for future needs.</p><p></p><p>After all, gold was a necessary material for suppressing evil spirits, and if any evil spirits were to appear, there would not be enough time to hastily forge the means to suppress them.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he had them prepared in advance, as they might be needed at any time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng approached the golden sarcophagus containing the sealed Yin Gui, and at this moment, the sarcophagus was slightly trembling, as if something inside was desperately trying to break free, but due to the iron chains holding it in place, it could not truly be shaken.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly are evil spirits, and are they truly unkillable?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>The unkillable nature of evil spirits was an ancient legend.</p><p></p><p>Whether in the Divination Occult Arts or the Longevity Dao Scriptures, there were records stating that evil spirits could not be killed, and could only be sealed away.</p><p></p><p>However, the Divination Occult Arts also recorded that evil spirits were not truly unkillable, and that only evil spirits could kill other evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>This was why some had attempted to refine evil spirits into their own bodies, hoping to harness the power of evil spirits to achieve the goal of killing them.</p><p></p><p>Alas, while refining evil spirits into one's body did grant tremendous power, it was still not enough to truly kill evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that after refining evil spirits, the power was no longer pure, and only the evil spirits that had broken free from suppression and self-revived could kill other evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, there was a contradiction.</p><p></p><p>"Evil spirits are not truly unkillable... Strictly speaking, it's not that they cannot be killed, but that only evil spirits can kill other evil spirits, and nothing else has the ability to do so!"</p><p></p><p>"But how can there be truly immortal and indestructible beings in this world? Since evil spirits can kill each other, there must be a reason behind it."</p><p></p><p>"If I can find the key to this, perhaps the legend of evil spirits being unkillable can be completely shattered—"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes flickered, his mind racing through all the information he had about evil spirits, and he already had some ideas.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

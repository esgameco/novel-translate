        <h1>Chapter 121</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When the news from the Liuyun Manor reached the court, the imperial court was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Fist Sect had been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Immortal Dao and Duan Ping had both perished.</p><p></p><p>Two grandmaster-level powerhouses had fallen at the hands of Gu Qingfeng, effectively weakening the rebel forces, which was seen as a good thing by the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>Duan Ping was from the Tianyang Sword Sect, and his death might anger the Tianyang Sword Sect, making the situation even worse.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>One thing that needs to be understood is that ever since the Tianyang Sword Sect supported Pei Jing, they have been openly opposing the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether Duan Ping's death angers the Tianyang Sword Sect or not, the two sides are destined to have no room for reconciliation.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Tianyang Sword Sect has not launched a large-scale attack, which must be due to their own concerns.</p><p></p><p>Similarly.</p><p></p><p>With such concerns in mind, whether Duan Ping lives or dies makes little difference.</p><p></p><p>When the timing is right.</p><p></p><p>Even if Duan Ping had not died, the Tianyang Sword Sect would have taken action.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary.</p><p></p><p>If the timing is not right.</p><p></p><p>Even though a Duan Ping has fallen, the Tianyang Sword Sect may not necessarily make a move.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>From any perspective, the destruction of the Divine Fist Sect and the loss of a grandmaster from the Tianyang Sword Sect are more beneficial than detrimental to the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Taishan Commandery Governor's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Taishou Yi listened to the report from his subordinate, his eyes flickering: "Hegemon Blade Gu Qingfeng, the rumors in the jianghu say that he is only at the half-step Grandmaster level, but now it seems that his strength is at least at the True Meaning Grandmaster level, to be able to slay the Divine Immortal Dao and Duan Ping."</p><p></p><p>True Meaning Grandmaster!</p><p></p><p>In the entire Taishan Commandery, they are the top-tier powerhouses, comparable to Fusion Realm Magi.</p><p></p><p>There are many Magi in the world.</p><p></p><p>But how many can truly reach the Fusion Realm.</p><p></p><p>This alone shows the extraordinary level of the True Meaning Grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Taishou Yi looked at the subordinate and asked in a deep voice, "How is the situation at the Liuyun Manor now?"</p><p></p><p>"Your Excellency, the Rebel King Pei Jing is now leading a large army to conquer the Liuyun Manor, and our forces there can only put up limited resistance. I'm afraid it won't be long before the Liuyun Manor is completely overrun!"</p><p></p><p>A man said, clasping his fist.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Taishou Yi nodded slightly: "If the Liuyun Manor cannot be defended, then there's no need to defend it. From now on, we will concentrate all our forces, the twelve prefectures of Taishan Commandery, and only need to hold onto six prefectures.</p><p></p><p>Now the one in Central Plains does not have much time left, and once that person passes away, the Taixuan Dynasty will inevitably disintegrate.</p><p></p><p>When the situation in Central Plains settles, it will be the time for the true dragon to emerge. By then, with the forces of six prefectures under our control, we can also make the new ruler value us!"</p><p></p><p>This speech could be considered extremely treacherous, but the people in the governor's mansion showed no surprise on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Because they all clearly see the current situation of the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Dynasty has ruled the world for three thousand years, but now it is at the end of its strength, only waiting for that ruler to pass away, then this three-thousand-year dynasty will completely disintegrate.</p><p></p><p>Unless——</p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Dynasty can once again produce a powerhouse like the Taixuan Ancestor three thousand years ago, who can firmly establish dominion over the world.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>The probability of this is extremely low.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>The collapse of the Taixuan Dynasty is a foregone conclusion.</p><p></p><p>Now, all the rebel kings who have the qualifications to compete for the throne are basically fighting for supremacy in the Central Plains, like Pei Jing, who is still in the small corner of Qingyun Province, have little chance of success.</p><p></p><p>Taishou Yi did not take Pei Jing seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>Even if he has the Tianyang Sword Sect behind him, it makes no difference.</p><p></p><p>An Immortal Sect!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The world is not limited to just the Tianyang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Now, Taishi Yi is waiting for the situation to become clearer, and then he will make a decision. In the current situation, to rashly take a side would be a disaster if he made a mistake.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary,</p><p></p><p>Staying on the sidelines</p><p></p><p>is the best choice.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Taishi Yi is the governor of Taishan Prefecture, commanding a large military force, so he has the qualifications to stay on the sidelines.</p><p></p><p>The prerequisite is that he must ensure he has sufficient strength, otherwise even if a true dragon is born later, the other party may not necessarily look up to him.</p><p></p><p>This is Taishi Yi's way of thinking.</p><p></p><p>The other people in the prefectural government also have the same idea.</p><p></p><p>Or rather,</p><p></p><p>Those with different ideas have already been eliminated.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently,</p><p></p><p>Someone asked, "Then what should we do about the Gu Family Village?"</p><p></p><p>"We can just convey our goodwill a little, but for other matters, there's no need to take drastic actions for now."</p><p></p><p>Taishi Yi pondered for a moment, then said.</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Qingfeng is a True Meaning Sect Master-level expert, the prefectural government will naturally extend goodwill, but for other matters, there's no need to hurry.</p><p></p><p>In Taishi Yi's view, Gu Qingfeng is a proud and arrogant person, so even if the prefectural government extends an olive branch, he may not readily accept it.</p><p></p><p>It's better to first express goodwill, and when the Tianyang Sword Sect really makes a move, and the other party feels the pressure of an immortal sect, then the prefectural government can step forward to recruit him, and the success rate will be much higher.</p><p></p><p>These matters, Taishi Yi has his own calculations in mind.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng completely ignored the upheaval in the jianghu caused by the destruction of the Divine Fist Sect and the death of Duan Ping.</p><p></p><p>Now, he has already transported everything back to the Gu Family Village.</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang, seeing the dozens of horse-drawn carriages and the deep indentations on the ground, could vaguely guess what was loaded on the carriages.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the news from the jianghu had already reached them before Gu Qingfeng's return.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning that Gu Qingfeng had slain a Sect Master, Gu Yang was also shocked.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>This shock was not as great as he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Because Gu Yang found that as more and more of Gu Qingfeng's trump cards were revealed, his father seemed increasingly mysterious and often performed astonishing feats, which Gu Yang now considered normal.</p><p></p><p>But,</p><p></p><p>Normal as it may be,</p><p></p><p>Seeing so many resources appear, Gu Yang's heart could never truly calm down.</p><p></p><p>"These are the things from the Divine Fist Sect and the bandit strongholds along the way. Have someone count them, and there are a few boxes of martial arts, you take a look and handle them, but the rest of the gold is not to be touched, as it is for sealing evil spirits later!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang nodded, and after Gu Qingfeng left, he began to have people inventory the resources.</p><p></p><p>On the thirty or forty horse-drawn carriages, they were piled high with resources, and as one box after another was brought down and opened, what greeted the eye were numerous silver ingots and antique paintings.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's eyes instantly lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good, with this batch of resources, future actions will be much more convenient!"</p><p></p><p>To secretly cultivate and organize a large army, one must have sufficient silver as support, as relying solely on the Gu Family Village would be like a drop in the bucket.</p><p></p><p>But now that such a large amount of resources has been obtained, it can greatly alleviate the urgent need.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was so excited.</p><p></p><p>In fact, anyone who sees so many resources would find it difficult to remain calm.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

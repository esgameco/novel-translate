        <h1>Chapter 121</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When the news from the Liuyun Manor reached the court, the imperial court was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Fist Sect had been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Immortal Dao and Duan Ping had both perished.</p><p></p><p>Two grandmaster-level experts had fallen at the hands of Gu Qingfeng, effectively weakening the rebel forces, which was seen as a good thing by the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>Duan Ping was from the Tianyang Sword Sect, and his death might anger the Tianyang Sword Sect, making the situation even worse.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>One thing that needs to be understood is that.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the Tianyang Sword Sect supported Pei Jing, they have officially stood on the opposing side of the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether Duan Ping's death will anger the Tianyang Sword Sect, the two sides are destined to have no room for reconciliation.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, the Tianyang Sword Sect has not launched a large-scale attack, which must be due to their own concerns.</p><p></p><p>Similarly.</p><p></p><p>Given these concerns.</p><p></p><p>Whether there is one Duan Ping or not, it doesn't make much difference.</p><p></p><p>When the time is right.</p><p></p><p>Even if Duan Ping had not died, the Tianyang Sword Sect would have taken action.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary.</p><p></p><p>If the timing is not right.</p><p></p><p>Even though a Duan Ping has fallen, the Tianyang Sword Sect may not necessarily take any action.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>From any perspective, the destruction of the Divine Fist Sect and the loss of a grandmaster from the Tianyang Sword Sect are more beneficial than detrimental to the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Taiyuan Commandery Governor's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Taishan Yi listened to the report from his subordinates, his eyes flickering: "The Tyrant Sword Gu Qingfeng, the rumors in the jianghu say that he is only at the half-step Grandmaster level, but now it seems that he is able to slay the Divine Immortal Dao and Duan Ping, his strength is at least at the True Meaning Grandmaster level."</p><p></p><p>True Meaning Grandmaster!</p><p></p><p>In the entire Taiyuan Commandery, they are top-tier experts, comparable to Fusion Realm Magi.</p><p></p><p>There are many Magi in the world.</p><p></p><p>But how many can truly reach the Fusion Realm.</p><p></p><p>This alone shows the extraordinary level of a True Meaning Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Taishan Yi looked at the subordinate in front of him and asked in a deep voice, "How is the situation at the Liuyun Manor now?"</p><p></p><p>"Your Excellency, the Rebel King Pei Jing is now leading a large army to conquer the Liuyun Manor, our resistance forces are limited, and it won't be long before the Liuyun Manor is completely overrun!"</p><p></p><p>A man said, clasping his fist.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Taishan Yi nodded slightly: "If the Liuyun Manor cannot be defended, then don't bother defending it. From now on, concentrate all our forces, the Twelve Prefectures of Taiyuan Commandery, we only need to hold onto six prefectures.</p><p></p><p>Now the one in the Central Plains does not have much time left, once that person passes away, the Great Xuan Dynasty will inevitably disintegrate.</p><p></p><p>When the situation in the Central Plains settles, it will be the time for the true dragon to emerge. At that time, with the forces of six prefectures under our control, we can also make the new ruler value us!"</p><p></p><p>This series of remarks could be considered extremely treacherous, but the people in the Governor's Mansion showed no surprise on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Because they all clearly see the current situation of the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>The Great Xuan Dynasty has ruled the world for three thousand years, but now it is at the end of its strength, only waiting for that ruler to pass away, then this three-thousand-year dynasty will completely disintegrate.</p><p></p><p>Unless——</p><p></p><p>The Great Xuan Dynasty can once again produce a strong figure like the Great Xuan Ancestor three thousand years ago, who can stabilize the world.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>The probability of this is extremely low.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>The downfall of the Great Xuan Dynasty is a destined event.</p><p></p><p>Now, all the rebel kings who have the qualifications to compete for the throne are basically fighting for supremacy in the Central Plains, like Pei Jing who is still in the Qingyun Province, they have little chance of success.</p><p></p><p>Taishan Yi did not take Pei Jing seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>Even if he has the Tianyang Sword Sect backing him up.</p><p></p><p>An Immortal Sect!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The world is not just limited to the Tianyang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Now, Taishou Yi is waiting for the situation to become clearer, and then make a decision. In the current situation, to rashly take a side would be a disaster if he made a mistake.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary,</p><p></p><p>To be a bystander,</p><p></p><p>Is the best choice.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Taishou Yi is the governor of Taishan Prefecture, commanding a large military force, so he has the qualifications to be a bystander.</p><p></p><p>The prerequisite is that he must ensure he has enough strength, otherwise even if a true dragon is born later, the other party may not necessarily look up to him.</p><p></p><p>This is Taishou Yi's way of thinking.</p><p></p><p>The other people in the prefectural government also have the same idea.</p><p></p><p>Or rather,</p><p></p><p>Those with different ideas have already been eliminated.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently,</p><p></p><p>Someone asked, "Then what measures should we take regarding the Gu Family Village?"</p><p></p><p>"We can just convey our goodwill a little, but for other matters, there's no need to take drastic actions for now."</p><p></p><p>Taishou Yi pondered for a moment, then said.</p><p></p><p>Since the Gu Family Village has a true master-level combat strength, the prefectural government will naturally show goodwill, but for other matters, there's no need to hurry.</p><p></p><p>In Taishou Yi's view, Gu Qingfeng is a proud and arrogant person, even if the prefectural government extends an olive branch, he may not necessarily accept it.</p><p></p><p>It's better to first express goodwill, and when the Tianyang Sword Sect really makes a move, and the other party feels the pressure of an immortal sect, then the prefectural government can step forward to recruit him. The success rate would be much higher then.</p><p></p><p>These matters, Taishou Yi has his own calculations in mind.</p><p></p><p>—</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng completely ignored the shock in the jianghu caused by the destruction of the Shenquan Sect and the death of Duan Ping.</p><p></p><p>Now, </p><p></p><p>He has brought everything back to the Gu Family Village.</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang, seeing the dozens of horse-drawn carriages and the deep imprints on the ground, could vaguely guess what was loaded on the carriages.</p><p></p><p>In fact,</p><p></p><p>Before Gu Qingfeng returned, news from the jianghu had already reached them first.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning that Gu Qingfeng had slain a master, Gu Yang was also shocked.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>This shock was not as great as expected.</p><p></p><p>Because Gu Yang found that as Gu Qingfeng's various trump cards were revealed, his father became more and more mysterious and often did astonishing things, which Gu Yang now considered normal.</p><p></p><p>But,</p><p></p><p>Normal as it may be,</p><p></p><p>Seeing so many resources appear, Gu Yang's heart could never be at peace.</p><p></p><p>"These are the things from the Shenquan Sect and the bandit strongholds along the way. Have someone count them, there are a few boxes of martial arts, you take a look and handle them, but the rest of the gold cannot be touched, as they are for sealing evil spirits later!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang nodded, and after seeing Gu Qingfeng leave, he began to have people inventory the resources.</p><p></p><p>On the thirty or forty horse-drawn carriages, they were all piled up with resources. As one box after another was brought down and opened, what appeared before their eyes were numerous silver ingots and antique paintings.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's eyes immediately lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good, with this batch of resources, future actions will be much more convenient!"</p><p></p><p>To secretly cultivate and organize a large army, one must have sufficient silver as support, relying solely on the Gu Family Village alone would be like a drop in the bucket.</p><p></p><p>But now that such a large amount of resources has been obtained, it can greatly alleviate the urgent need.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was so excited.</p><p></p><p>In fact, anyone who sees so many resources would find it difficult to remain calm.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

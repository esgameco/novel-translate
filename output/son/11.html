        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng searched the body again, and finally found an identity token and a thin secret manual on the corpse.</p><p></p><p>"Necromantic Art - Devouring Heart Demon!"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the words on the cover, it was as if a bloody aura was rushing towards him. Gu Qingfeng frowned and immediately put away the Necromantic Art.</p><p></p><p>When he looked at the token, the front had the other person's name written on it, and the back had the three words "Exorcism Bureau".</p><p></p><p>"So he was from the Exorcism Bureau!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had already known this when Shangguan Jiang revealed his identity before dying, and now obtaining this token was just a complete confirmation.</p><p></p><p>According to Xu Jun, the people of the Exorcism Bureau were a mysterious organization under the Taixuan Dynasty, specifically responsible for dealing with evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>But now it seems...</p><p></p><p>These Exorcism Bureau people are not simple at all.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Shangguan Jiang's already dead body suddenly trembled slightly, as if something was about to awaken from it. Gu Qingfeng's expression changed slightly, and he did not dare to stay in the original place, taking Gu Yang and leaving immediately.</p><p></p><p>Without Shangguan Jiang's obstruction, Gu Qingfeng broke through the bloody mist very easily.</p><p></p><p>The moment he left the bloody mist, the eerie and cold aura that had been lingering in his heart also disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Looking back, the bloody mist still lingered, and the entire Linxian County was nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's tense nerves relaxed slightly, but then a sharp pain suddenly came. He looked down and found that the many wounds on his body had already severely rotted and emitted a foul odor.</p><p></p><p>If it were an ordinary person, these injuries would have already led to death.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Qingfeng had broken through the Blood Refining Realm, and his vitality was much stronger than that of ordinary people. Even with such serious injuries, it had not truly harmed his life.</p><p></p><p>However, if this matter continued to drag on, it would only become more troublesome.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's leave this place first!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng left with Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Soon after he left, Shangguan Jiang's corpse in the bloody mist suddenly began to tremble violently, and a strange black shadow seemed to emerge from the corpse. The blue-black face was hideous and terrifying, the arms were long and unlike a human's, and the five fingers had sharp claws that seemed to be able to easily tear through human skin and flesh.</p><p></p><p>The moment this strange existence revived, it looked at Shangguan Jiang's corpse with a greedy gaze, then crouched down and began to devour.</p><p></p><p>In less than a moment, the flesh and blood of the corpse had been completely consumed, leaving only a pile of scattered bones on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The strange black shadow let out a howl, and a terrifying and cold aura burst out from the bloody mist, startling the entire Linxian County.</p><p></p><p>Ye Yuan, who was in the government office, sensed this aura and his expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"The aura of an evil spirit!"</p><p></p><p>"No... this is the Devouring Heart Demon!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Ye Yuan rushed into the bloody mist. Seeing the scattered bones and tattered clothes on the ground, he recognized the identity of the person at a glance.</p><p></p><p>"Shangguan Jiang is dead!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Yuan's face turned green.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jiang's death was not a big deal, but the more important question was what could have caused Shangguan Jiang, who was a Taoist practitioner, to die here. After all, Shangguan Jiang was a Taoist practitioner, and even the weakest one would not be comparable to ordinary martial artists, let alone in a place like Linxian County where the strongest were only at the Skin Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>How could such martial artists have the possibility of killing a Taoist practitioner?</p><p></p><p>Moreover...</p><p></p><p>Now that Shangguan Jiang is dead, the thing inside him has apparently come out.</p><p></p><p>Just as this thought flashed through Ye Yuan's mind, a strange and cold aura suddenly attacked him, making him feel a strong sense of crisis. Without thinking, he quickly stepped aside.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Come, the next breath will see the emergence of a strange black shadow and the piercing of sharp claws."</p><p></p><p>"Devouring Heart Demon!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Yuan's mind sank.</p><p></p><p>The worst outcome had already appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Jiang had fallen.</p><p></p><p>The Devouring Heart Demon within the opponent had also completely awakened.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Devouring Heart Demon rushing towards him, Ye Yuan's gaze turned ruthless: "Damn it, don't let me find out who killed Shangguan Jiang, or this matter will never end!"</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>"Family Master!"</p><p></p><p>In a certain courtyard, a middle-aged warrior dressed in tight-fitting clothes was standing respectfully before a person.</p><p></p><p>This person was none other than Gu Qingfeng, who had left Lianxian County.</p><p></p><p>"Still no news?"</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Family Master, we have been trying our best to secretly investigate the situation in Lianxian County, but Lianxian County has disappeared as if it vanished into thin air, and we have not obtained any information at all."</p><p></p><p>The person replied truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Qingfeng nodded and then waved his hand, saying, "If that's the case, then you can leave first."</p><p></p><p>"Yesâ€”"</p><p></p><p>The person respectfully departed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng gently stroked his beard, and an occasional cold glint flashed in his deep eyes.</p><p></p><p>Unable to find the whereabouts of Lianxian County.</p><p></p><p>This meant that something must have happened in Lianxian County.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could a county of such a large scale completely disappear without a trace?</p><p></p><p>It had been nearly half a year since Gu Qingfeng left Lianxian County and went to Baishi Road in Guangyang Prefecture with Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>The Great Xuan Dynasty.</p><p>Thirty-six prefectures in the Nine Provinces.</p><p>One prefecture has twelve counties.</p><p>Guangyang Prefecture, to which Lianxian County belonged, was a prefecture city under Taishan Prefecture. The previously rumored plague-stricken Qingjiang Prefecture also belonged to Taishan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>When he first set foot on Baishi Road, Gu Qingfeng also acted low-key, gradually understanding the strength of Baishi Road.</p><p></p><p>The investigation revealed that the martial arts foundation of Baishi Road was much stronger than that of Lianxian County.</p><p></p><p>In Lianxian County, the Jinniu Martial Arts Academy was considered a renowned martial arts force, but its strongest member was only at the Refining Skin Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, in Baishi Road, while Refining Skin Realm cultivators were not numerous, they were by no means rare.</p><p></p><p>Above Refining Skin, there were also cultivators at the Refining Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>A clan called the Qin Family had five Refining Blood Realm cultivators as its core, and an organization called the Iron Bone Gang had four Refining Blood Realm cultivators as its core.</p><p></p><p>These were the two most powerful forces in Baishi Road.</p><p></p><p>Under these two major forces, there were many small and large factions intertwined, but regardless, as long as one could reach the Refining Blood Realm, they would be considered a strong cultivator in Baishi Road.</p><p></p><p>After understanding the situation in Baishi Road, Gu Qingfeng settled down there and established the Gu Family, a new force that appeared quietly.</p><p></p><p>The emergence of this unfamiliar family naturally attracted the attention of many forces in Baishi Road.</p><p></p><p>Some even focused their attention on the Gu Family.</p><p></p><p>However, when Gu Qingfeng displayed his Refining Blood Realm strength, many voices were silenced.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the jianghu, strength was the most respected.</p><p></p><p>Although the Gu Family's foundation was weak, with a Refining Blood Realm cultivator as its core, it was sufficient to deal with most troubles.</p><p></p><p>Forces with Refining Blood Realm cultivators of their own did not want to pick a fight with a cultivator of the same realm without reason, and those without Refining Blood Realm cultivators did not dare to provoke the Gu Family.</p><p></p><p>In this way, after nearly half a year, the Gu Family established by Gu Qingfeng had firmly rooted itself in Baishi Road.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

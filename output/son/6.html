        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As Xu Jun started talking about the evil spirits, the expressions of everyone in the hall became fearful and perplexed.</p><p></p><p>Only a few of the older instructors and Gu Qingfeng were able to maintain their composure.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng asked, "According to the words of the Pavilion Master, how powerful are the evil spirits?"</p><p></p><p>"As for how powerful the evil spirits are, even I am not certain. But the Qingjiang Prefecture that was destroyed 30 years ago, and the Xuanyuan City that was destroyed 15 years ago, both had many powerful forces stationed there.</p><p></p><p>I do not know the exact level of those powerful forces, but there must have been Refinement of Blood realm cultivators among them.</p><p></p><p>Even so, those two places were still destroyed by the evil spirits!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Jun's words made Gu Qingfeng's heart sink a little.</p><p></p><p>According to the other's description, even Refinement of Blood realm cultivators might not necessarily be a match for the evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, Gu Qingfeng asked again, "Pavilion Master, what are your plans now?"</p><p></p><p>"We can no longer stay in Lian County. Although Lian County is now besieged, we may still have a chance to leave. All of you have reached the Refinement of Skin realm, and Instructor Gu and I have even reached the peak of the Refinement of Skin realm.</p><p></p><p>If we work together to leave the city, perhaps we can break through the blood mist restraints and then leave Lian County!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Jun finally revealed the purpose of gathering everyone.</p><p></p><p>His words caused the expressions of many instructors to fluctuate, as if they were pondering something.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was not a fool.</p><p></p><p>According to Xu Jun's words, the evil spirits were terrifying, and even Refinement of Blood realm cultivators were not their match. As a group of Refinement of Skin realm cultivators, could they really break through the evil spirits' blockade?</p><p></p><p>Seeing the changes in everyone's expressions, Xu Jun also realized their thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow disciples, the evil spirits have both strong and weak ones. Not all evil spirits are as powerful as the one in Qingjiang Prefecture. With our strength, we still have a chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the longer we stay in Lian County, the more dangerous it will be. Now the evil spirits are only besieging Lian County, not truly attacking. If we wait until the evil spirits make their move, it will be impossible for us to leave!"</p><p></p><p>These words became the final straw that broke the back of everyone's defenses.</p><p></p><p>To leave would be to risk their lives, but to not leave would be certain death. There was no need to deliberate further on the choice.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Xu Jun looked at the silent Gu Qingfeng and asked, "Instructor Gu, what are your thoughts?"</p><p></p><p>"According to the Pavilion Master's words, the evil spirits are indeed beyond the understanding of ordinary people. But the imperial court should have ways to deal with the evil spirits. I wonder what the situation of the local government is now?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's words made the others pause in surprise.</p><p></p><p>That's right, they had forgotten about the existence of the local government.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lian County was under the jurisdiction of the Great Xuan Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>If there were truly evil spirits, the imperial court could not have done nothing about it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jun said, "The court does have capable people who can deal with the evil spirits, but the problem is that Lian County is just a small place. Those high-level experts would not stay in Lian County.</p><p></p><p>As for the strength of the Lian County government, it is not that I look down on them, but with their power, they probably do not have the qualifications to deal with the evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>By the time the news of Lian County reaches the imperial court, Lian County would have already followed in the footsteps of Qingjiang Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Xu Jun also bitterly shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He had never really considered relying on the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>His words once again shattered the hope that had just begun to rise in the hearts of the others.</p><p></p><p>Then, someone asked, "Pavilion Master, when do you plan to take action?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The matter of the evil spirit cannot be delayed too long. We will prepare for a maximum of three days, and then we will all gather at the martial arts school and leave together.</p><p></p><p>Remember, this news must not be leaked out, otherwise too many people will know, and it may affect our plan!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Jun said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"After all, the blood and flesh of living beings are of great attraction to the evil spirit. If only a few people leave Linxian County, the evil spirit may not take any action. </p><p></p><p>But if many people leave Linxian County together, the evil spirit may act ahead of time..."</p><p></p><p>His words made it quite clear that he intended to use the local residents to attract the evil spirit's attention, while taking the opportunity to leave himself.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p></p><p>the many instructors showed no surprise on their faces. </p><p></p><p>To them,</p><p></p><p>their own lives were more important.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's brows furrowed slightly, but he did not say much.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng left the Jinniu Martial Arts School, he saw the people on the street looking anxious, all discussing matters related to the blood mist.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng went to the city gate, only to see the blood mist permeating outside the Linxian County gate, filled with a strange, icy aura, as if there was something terrible lurking within the blood mist, making him instinctively feel threatened.</p><p></p><p>In front of the blood mist, the bloodstains had not yet dried, but there were no corpses of the civilians, presumably cleaned up by the officials.</p><p></p><p>"Blood mist!"</p><p>"Evil spirit..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the blood mist deeply, then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>He had no intention of entering the blood mist alone.</p><p></p><p>After all, the so-called evil spirit was likely lurking within the blood mist, and if he were to enter the blood mist alone, he might end up confronting the evil spirit.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Xu Jun's words also resurfaced in Gu Qingfeng's mind.</p><p></p><p>The evil spirit craves the vital energy and blood of living beings.</p><p></p><p>The Jinniu School Master's gathering of the people to leave Linxian County might not necessarily be for their own good.</p><p></p><p>From Xu Jun's words today, Gu Qingfeng had already realized that the other party's heart was cold and he was not a good person.</p><p></p><p>"However, what Xu Jun is planning does not matter. What's important is that my own strength is sufficient. Xu Jun probably only thinks of me as an ordinary person who has reached the peak of leather refining, not knowing that I have already reached the peak in two martial arts.</p><p></p><p>After all, for ordinary people, it is already not easy to practice one martial art to its peak, let alone two."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was confident in his own strength, and Xu Jun, although the Jinniu Martial Arts School Master, was not necessarily stronger than him.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore,</p><p></p><p>he had the Blood Refining Pill in his possession.</p><p></p><p>If he could break through the Blood Refining realm within three days with the help of the Blood Refining Pill, then he would have a better chance of leaving Linxian County.</p><p></p><p>Howeverâ€”</p><p></p><p>Whether he could break through within three days was also a question.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Back at his residence, Gu Yang was still practicing martial arts, as he was deeply passionate about the martial arts path, which was what Gu Qingfeng wanted to see.</p><p></p><p>"Yang'er, there will be great trouble in Linxian County soon. Three days from now, follow your father and leave this place!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng spoke.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was puzzled upon hearing this: "Father, what kind of trouble are you talking about?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't ask so much, just focus on your cultivation these few days."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had no intention of elaborating further, and simply handed a bottle of Blood Refining Pill to Gu Yang, instructing him to take the pill to assist in his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

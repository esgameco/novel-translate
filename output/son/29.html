        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sat at the head position, with Gu Yang and Meng Peng sitting on the sides.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to Father, from the suppression of the Chu family, we have obtained 200,000 taels of silver, as well as various medicinal materials, antiques, and paintings, which are estimated to be worth around 150,000 to 200,000 taels.</p><p></p><p>We have also obtained 6 low-grade martial arts techniques and 1 mid-grade martial art technique!"</p><p></p><p>"Additionally, the Chu family had several businesses, including 3 restaurants, 5 medicine shops, 2 brothels, and 2 casinos!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang held the account book and truthfully reported all of the Chu family's assets.</p><p></p><p>As an established force in the White Stone Dao, the Chu family's assets were quite substantial.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Gu Yang's report, Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly: "Arrange people to take over all of these businesses. The Chu family had dared to encroach on our Gu family's interests, and now it's time for a change."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore -"</p><p></p><p>"Have you compiled the statistics on the Iron Bone Gang's assets as well?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Yang nodded.</p><p></p><p>"The Iron Bone Gang's assets have also been tallied. They currently have around 530,000 taels of silver, as well as 3,000 taels of gold.</p><p></p><p>If we convert all the antiques and paintings into silver, it would be around 300,000 taels.</p><p></p><p>As for their businesses, they have 16 restaurants and inns, 8 brothels, 6 gambling dens, and 23 other miscellaneous enterprises."</p><p></p><p>"In terms of martial arts, we have found 16 low-grade and 2 mid-grade techniques from the Iron Bone Gang."</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Chu family, the Iron Bone Gang's assets were undoubtedly much more substantial.</p><p></p><p>This was to be expected, as the Iron Bone Gang was a dominant force in the White Stone Dao.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng had anticipated this, upon hearing the full extent of the Iron Bone Gang's assets, he couldn't help but take a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>If everything was converted to silver, the Iron Bone Gang's wealth would be worth over a million taels.</p><p></p><p>However, what caught Gu Qingfeng's attention the most was the gold.</p><p></p><p>Yes, the gold.</p><p></p><p>In this world, gold was a truly scarce commodity, unmatched by any other.</p><p></p><p>Although the official exchange rate set by the Taixuan Dynasty was 1 tael of gold to 100 taels of silver, the reality was that gold was priceless.</p><p></p><p>The court had almost complete control over the gold, with very little circulating among the common people, which is what made gold so scarce.</p><p></p><p>Others might not understand why gold was so precious, but Gu Qingfeng, with his mastery of occult arts, knew that gold had a natural ability to suppress evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, to seal away evil spirits, one must have gold.</p><p></p><p>This is why the court tightly controlled the gold.</p><p></p><p>As for the matter of these so-called evil spirits, to be honest, Gu Qingfeng had not heard of their existence during his many years in the White Stone Dao. The incident in Lianxian County had felt like nothing more than a dream.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng was well aware that the events in Lianxian County were not just a dream.</p><p></p><p>This world did have the existence of evil spirits and sorcerers.</p><p></p><p>It's just that they were not something ordinary people could encounter, which is why news of them had not spread.</p><p></p><p>"Bring all the gold to me immediately. Also, dispatch people to take over the assets of the other two factions. Whoever dares to obstruct them shall be killed."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, inform all the factions in the White Stone Dao that they must all gather their leaders within three days."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Come visit our Gu family, and those who don't come will have to face the consequences!"</p><p></p><p>"I understand, father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression was slightly exhilarated.</p><p></p><p>He understood that the Gu family was no longer keeping a low profile.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had already heard about the events happening outside. Gu Qingfeng had single-handedly killed Chu Tianxiong with a punch and defeated Luo Yu in two moves, earning him the title of the strongest in the White Stone Dao.</p><p></p><p>With his father possessing such strength, there was no need for the Gu family to continue staying low-key.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Gu Yang had long wanted to revive the Gu family's glory.</p><p></p><p>It was only because Gu Qingfeng had always acted low-key that Gu Yang had suppressed his inner impulse. But now, Gu Qingfeng's actions had ensured that the Gu family would become the number one force in the White Stone Dao.</p><p></p><p>As Gu Yang was about to leave, Meng Peng quietly said, "Family Master, according to Luo Yu's words before his death, the Iron Bone Gang seems to have a connection with the Divine Martial King. This matter is not trivial. If what he said is true, we may have already offended the Divine Martial King."</p><p></p><p>"How much do you know about this Divine Martial King?" Gu Qingfeng's expression remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng said, "The Divine Martial King's name is Pei Jing. The Pei family is the top family in Nanyang Prefecture, and the governor of Nanyang Prefecture is hereditary to the Pei family. Pei Jing was rumored to have been born with divine strength and later became a true disciple of the Tianyang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Fifteen years ago, when the emperor was seriously ill and the court was in chaos, and a natural disaster struck Nanyang Prefecture, Pei Jing seized the opportunity and within a few years brought the entire Nanyang Prefecture under his control.</p><p></p><p>Later, under Pei Jing's leadership, the army conquered Chijiang Prefecture in less than ten years, amassing an army of several million and calling himself the Divine Martial King."</p><p></p><p>"Now, Pei Jing's Divine Martial Army is attacking Danyang Prefecture. With Danyang Prefecture's strength, it may not be able to withstand the Divine Martial Army. Once Danyang Prefecture falls, Taishan Prefecture will surely become Pei Jing's next target."</p><p></p><p>Meng Peng's words caused a slight change in Gu Qingfeng's expression.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of years ago, the emperor of the Taixuan Dynasty had been seriously ill. Combined with the continuous natural disasters and the uprisings of various rebel armies, these were things that Gu Qingfeng had heard about.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not have much understanding of the specific situations of the various rebel armies.</p><p></p><p>Now, listening to Meng Peng's words, Gu Qingfeng also realized that this Divine Martial King was no simple figure.</p><p></p><p>In just over a decade, the other party had already conquered nearly three prefectures, commanding an army of millions, with truly formidable strength.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng calmly said, "The problem of the Divine Martial King does not need to be considered for now. This is Taishan Prefecture, not Nanyang Prefecture. Moreover, even if the Divine Martial King really conquers and marches on Taishan Prefecture, whether he can reach the White Stone Dao is still a question.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, a small Iron Bone Gang may not even be noticed by Pei Jing.</p><p></p><p>Rather than worrying about these problems, it would be better to first consolidate the forces of the White Stone Dao!"</p><p></p><p>The matter of the Iron Bone Gang made Gu Qingfeng truly understand one truth.</p><p></p><p>In order to survive in this chaotic world, one must possess sufficient strength.</p><p></p><p>If he had an army of millions under his command, why would he need to fear a small Divine Martial King Pei Jing?</p><p></p><p>Therefore, what Gu Qingfeng needed to do now was to first integrate the martial forces of the White Stone Dao and enhance the foundation of the Gu family as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>As long as the strength was sufficient, even if the Divine Martial King eventually conquered Taishan Prefecture, the Gu family would have enough bargaining power.</p><p></p><p>If the Gu family was weak, they might not even have the qualifications to stand before the Divine Martial King.</p><p></p><p>And then, there were the demonic creatures and sorcerers.</p><p></p><p>Although these years, the demonic creatures and sorcerers seemed to have completely disappeared, in front of Gu Qingfeng, things were not that simple.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was to deal with the Divine Martial King or to survive in the chaotic world, strength was an indispensable element.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The morning sun was just rising.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng walked out of the bedroom. The bloodstains in the backyard from yesterday had been washed clean, and the body of Si Tian had been properly disposed of. However, upon closer inspection, one could still see some residual redness.</p><p></p><p>Since he had offended the Shen Wu Wang, Gu Qingfeng did not pay much attention to that. His only focus was on improving his own strength.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, as long as one's strength is sufficient, all problems can be solved.</p><p></p><p>"Yesterday, Si Tian not only had a bronze skeleton, but had also cultivated a partial silver skeleton, indicating that his cultivation had long since entered the intermediate stage of bone refinement. However, in the life-and-death battle, he was not my match.</p><p></p><p>From this, it can be seen that my current strength, if pitted against ordinary late-stage bone refinement cultivators, should have a good chance of victory!"</p><p></p><p>Last night's battle was the first battle Gu Qingfeng had experienced since breaking through the bone refinement realm.</p><p></p><p>One top-tier mid-grade martial art had been perfected.</p><p>Two low-grade martial arts had been broken through.</p><p>One low-grade martial art had been perfected.</p><p></p><p>This allowed his strength after entering the bone refinement realm to be much stronger than ordinary bone refinement realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Scorching Sun Palm is considered a mid-grade martial art, with such a martial art perfected and entering the bone refinement realm, it would be more powerful than cultivators of the same realm who have broken through the bone refinement realm by cultivating high-grade martial arts.</p><p></p><p>This shows how powerful the Scorching Sun Immortal, who created this martial art, must have been."</p><p></p><p>The Scorching Sun Palm had tempered his iron bones, making his entire body's iron bones much more resilient than ordinary iron bones.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Gu Qingfeng had previously consumed a large amount of Blood Refining Elixirs. Such elixirs not only can enhance a cultivator's cultivation, but can also strengthen the foundation of their qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>This is the reason why Gu Qingfeng's overall strength surpasses that of his peers.</p><p></p><p>The external elixirs cannot be compared to the Blood Refining Elixir at all.</p><p></p><p>Such an elixir that builds a solid foundation not only has no side effects, but can also make one's foundation even more robust.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Gu Yang came to pay his respects.</p><p></p><p>"Son pays respects to Father!"</p><p></p><p>"You've come."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the Gu Yang before him. The latter's qi and blood were robust, and his foundation was stable, obviously having reached the peak of skin refinement, and could even be considered to be half a step into blood refinement.</p><p></p><p>Such a cultivation realm, only lacking half a step to break through the blood refinement realm.</p><p></p><p>"I see your qi and blood are stable. It won't be long before you can break through the blood refinement realm. Today, I shall pass on two mid-grade martial arts to you, hoping you will cultivate them diligently."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Father!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the words "mid-grade martial arts", Gu Yang's eyes also lit up.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Gu Qingfeng did not waste any time and directly passed on the Scorching Sun Palm and the Heavenly Thunder Sword Technique to him.</p><p></p><p>The Scorching Sun Palm needs no further explanation - such a powerful martial art is even more precious than ordinary high-grade martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people, Gu Qingfeng would not reveal such a supreme art.</p><p></p><p>But as Gu Yang was being cultivated as the heir of the Gu family, Gu Qingfeng naturally would not be stingy about it.</p><p></p><p>As for the Heavenly Thunder Sword Technique, it is also a top-tier mid-grade martial art.</p><p></p><p>As for why he did not pass on the Hundred Refinements Golden Body or the Seven Killing Sword Technique, it was because the former was not necessarily stronger than the Scorching Sun Palm in terms of foundation cultivation, and the latter would be difficult to fully utilize without the corresponding cultivation base as a foundation.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Thunder Sword Technique was the most suitable martial art.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After handing over the secret manuals containing the Scorching Sun Palm and the Heavenly Thunder Sword Technique to Gu Yang, Gu Qingfeng also handed over the remaining sixty Blood Refining Elixirs to him.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Refining Elixirs were no longer useful to him.</p><p></p><p>Rather than letting them go to waste in his own hands, it was better to give them to Gu Yang directly.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the martial arts and elixirs, Gu Yang respectfully withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng focused on comprehending the Hundred Refinements Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>When he truly comprehended the Hundred Refinements Golden Body...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At that time, Gu Qingfeng discovered that this martial arts technique had many similarities with the Hunjian Iron Cloth Armor.</p><p></p><p>"The Hunjian Iron Cloth Armor should be a remnant of the Hundred Refinements Golden Body, so the Iron Bone Sect must have been supported by the Shenwu King. The so-called unparalleled sect technique is also a part of the Hundred Refinements Golden Body!"</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Refinements Golden Body is divided into three stages. The first stage is Refining the Skin! The second stage is Refining the Blood! The third stage is Refining the Bone! The nine layers of the Hunjian Iron Cloth Armor are the subdivisions of the first and second stages of the Hundred Refinements Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>If he had not obtained the Hundred Refinements Golden Body, Gu Qingfeng would naturally have to cultivate the Hunjian Iron Cloth Armor, but now that he had obtained this martial arts technique, there was no need to cultivate the latter.</p><p></p><p>As Gu Qingfeng's thoughts settled, the text on the attribute panel began to change.</p><p></p><p>The previous "Hunjian Iron Cloth Armor" disappeared, and the "Hundred Refinements Golden Body" also changed from "not yet entered" to the "First Stage Initiation".</p><p></p><p>"It seems that martial arts techniques with the same origin can be integrated together, but I must comprehend it myself first!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng understood this in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, Gu Qingfeng devoted himself to cultivating the Hundred Refinements Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>He would not miss the supreme martial arts technique that leads to the Perfection of the Golden Bone.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Gu Qingfeng also gradually passed down a portion of the Hunjian Iron Cloth Armor to some trusted Gu family guards for them to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>As for Meng Peng, Gu Qingfeng directly bestowed the complete Hunjian Iron Cloth Armor upon him.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Qingfeng had now broken through the Refining the Bone realm and had an supreme martial arts technique in hand, so he no longer needed to control the common mid-grade martial arts so tightly.</p><p></p><p>Providing appropriate benefits can make people more devoted to serving him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed.</p><p></p><p>Sitian Zhe's movements in the Gu family had not caused any disturbance, as if the news had not been leaked out at all.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Qingfeng was not worried. Even if the news was leaked, it's not like the Shenwu King could directly attack Guangyang Prefecture, right?</p><p></p><p>This, Gu Qingfeng was not worried about at all.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had people constantly monitoring the situation in Taishan Prefecture. If the Shenmu King's army really invaded, he would be the first to know the news.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Gu Qingfeng spent all his time cultivating the Hundred Refinements Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>In half a month, he had already advanced the Hundred Refinements Golden Body from the Initiation stage to the Initial Perfection stage of the First Stage.</p><p></p><p>Within a year, Gu Qingfeng was confident of completely cultivating the First Stage of this technique.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the information panel that had been quiet for a long time refreshed again.</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has broken through to the Initial Refinement of the Blood stage!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +50 Promotion Points!"</p><p>"Reward: 100 Refining Blood Elixirs!"</p><p>"Reward: 10 Refining Bone Elixirs!"</p><p>"Reward: Perfected Mid-Grade Martial Art 'Heavenly Might Invincible Body'!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Qingfeng's expression immediately brightened.</p><p></p><p>"Yang'er has broken through!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's breakthrough from Refining the Skin to the Initial Refinement of the Blood stage was much faster than before.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng felt this was normal.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Qingfeng had given Gu Yang almost all the Refining Blood Elixirs previously, so the latter's breakthrough would naturally be faster.</p><p></p><p>The difference was that while the previous breakthrough only gave 10 Promotion Points, this time it directly gave 50 Promotion Points, a several-fold increase in the reward.</p><p></p><p>This shows that the rewards for breakthroughs in higher realms are completely incomparable to the lower realms.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

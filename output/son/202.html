        <h1>Chapter 202</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Regarding the Liang Province Li Family, Gu Qingfeng also had some understanding.</p><p></p><p>Among the immortal sects and families in the world, there were only a small number of them. The Liang Province Li Family was one of the immortal families.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, the strength of the Liang Province Li Family was not weaker than the already destroyed Tianyang Sword Sect. The strength of that Li Family patriarch was far from ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Yet even such a powerful expert was slain on the spot by that Grand Master of the True Intent from the Xie Imperial Clan, showing how terrifying the latter's strength was.</p><p></p><p>"If I had the chance, I would like to exchange blows with that Grand Master of the True Intent, but it seems there is no opportunity for that now," Gu Qingfeng shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple - that Grand Master of the True Intent was going to die. Even if he had not sustained heavy injuries, there was no chance of him surviving. The immortal sects and families would not allow such a Grand Master, who could slay the patriarch of an immortal family, to live.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the qi and blood of a Grand Master was something these powers coveted. Now that the great army was besieging the capital of the Central State, the downfall of the Xie Imperial Clan was only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng continued his seclusion.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, the secret guards delivered the secret methods of the Divine Martial Sect.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng looked at the secret methods, his expression showed some disappointment.</p><p></p><p>"These secret methods are indeed extraordinary, but unfortunately, they are of little use to martial artists at the Grand Master realm and above."</p><p></p><p>While the secret methods of the Divine Martial Sect were indeed extraordinary, Gu Qingfeng could see that they were almost ineffective for him at his current level. </p><p></p><p>There was indeed some disappointment, but Gu Qingfeng soon became at ease. Putting aside the matter of the secret methods, Gu Qingfeng continued to ponder the Indestructible Dao Intention.</p><p></p><p>In the Central State, the ancient capital city was now completely dyed red with blood, with severed limbs and piles of corpses at the city gates, emanating a pungent bloody stench.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the great army was still besieging the city. Several figures stood in the air, looking towards the capital with cold expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Ji Chunqiu, why do you have to resist so stubbornly? Now that Ji Shendao has passed away, what can your Xie Imperial Clan use to withstand us?" The Grand Master Taixuan looked at the figure on the city wall, his gaze indifferent.</p><p></p><p>Ji Chunqiu's expression was icy cold: "My Taixuan Dynasty has ruled the world for three thousand years. Do you really think you can destroy the foundation of my Xie Imperial Clan? If you want to fight, I will accompany you to the end. But last time it was Li Xuanji who died, and this time it might be you."</p><p></p><p>When the name Li Xuanji was mentioned, a trace of wariness flashed imperceptibly in the eyes of the various experts.</p><p></p><p>In the previous battle, Ji Shendao had unleashed a secret technique, ruthlessly slaying Li Xuanji on the spot. That scene had been deeply imprinted in their minds. No one was confident of withstanding that strike from Ji Shendao.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Grand Master Taixuan sneered, "Ji Shendao is dead, and your Xie Imperial Clan has no one to replace him. If you think you can still play tricks, you are being too presumptuous!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Grand Master Taixuan suddenly attacked. The powerful experts at the Transformation Realm unleashed their might, like surging tidal waves sweeping over. Many of the imperial court's experts turned pale at this sight, as they were no different from ants before such powerful figures.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Ji Chunqiu stepped forward, and a terrifying spiritual power suddenly erupted from him. A mysterious black shadow appeared behind him, a hundred-zhang tall figure as towering as a mountain.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Ji Chunqiu struck out with a palm, and the two forces collided, causing Grand Master Taixuan's body to tremble violently, being forced to retreat.</p><p></p><p>This unexpected turn of events made Grand Master Taixuan's pupils constrict.</p><p></p><p>"Transformation Realm!" </p><p></p><p>"You dare to secretly cultivate demonic arts!"</p><p></p><p>This time, Grand Master Taixuan was truly shocked. He never imagined that Ji Chunqiu would secretly cultivate demonic arts and reach the Transformation Realm, and his cultivation had even reached the peak of the Transformation Realm, or even the verge of the Deity Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ji Chunqiu's display of power, the other experts' expressions also changed drastically. A member of the imperial clan cultivating demonic arts was a taboo that all powers had agreed upon and could not be violated, for the ruler must not achieve immortality. If a ruler who controlled the world were to achieve immortality, it would be a disaster for the immortal sects and families.</p><p></p><p>Yet they never expected Ji Chunqiu to have secretly cultivated demonic arts, and to have reached such a terrifying level of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the ruler should live eternally. What's wrong with me cultivating demonic arts? It's just a pity that you all acted too hastily. If you had given me another hundred years, I would have definitely reached the Deity Transformation Realm!" </p><p></p><p>Seeing that his trump card was exposed, Ji Chunqiu was unafraid, looking at the others with disdain, while a trace of regret flickered in the depths of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If he could enter the Divine Realm, all the practitioners in the world would be like ants to him.</p><p></p><p>At that time,</p><p></p><p>The imperial house of the Ji clan would not only be able to suppress the world for three thousand years, but even four or five thousand years would be no problem.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately,</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the Divine Realm is not easy.</p><p></p><p>Even though Ji Chunqiu has been collecting the vital energy and blood of living beings all these years, as well as secretly utilizing many heavenly materials and treasures to cultivate, he has only just barely broken through to the half-step Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Since you all already know my secret, then there is no need for you to live any longer!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Chunqiu roared, stepping out into the air and charging towards Taixuan Shi and the others.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the others' expressions also became grave, directly unleashing their full power to contend with Ji Chunqiu.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Ji Chunqiu had cultivated demonic arts and reached the half-step Divine Realm, the other hidden experts also could not sit still, and one by one appeared to join forces in besieging him.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>The assault on the city became increasingly fierce. Although there were Martial Dao Grand Masters guarding the city gates, they were now unable to completely suppress the momentum of the army.</p><p></p><p>Finally,</p><p></p><p>The city gates were breached. The grand capital was plunged into a sea of fire and chaos.</p><p></p><p>"Kill! I want you all to die without a trace!!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the capital being breached, Ji Chunqiu's expression was filled with rage. His powerful spiritual energy shattered the space as he fiercely attacked Taixuan Shi.</p><p></p><p>The latter's expression changed, and he exerted his full strength to resist, but could not withstand Ji Chunqiu's furious strike. His protective spiritual energy was shattered, and blood seeped from the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"This fellow is so vicious, everyone must not hold back any longer, or else the mission will end in failure—"</p><p></p><p>Taixuan Shi roared hoarsely, and the evil phantom behind him cast its shadow in the void as he unleashed his full spiritual power to the limit.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this situation, the others also did not hesitate, one by one displaying their strongest techniques, joining hands with Taixuan Shi to collectively attack Ji Chunqiu.</p><p></p><p>Even though Ji Chunqiu had reached the half-step Divine Realm, now facing the siege of many experts, he also felt immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>His expression showed no fear at all.</p><p></p><p>"Come, no matter how many of you there are, today I will capture you all!"</p><p></p><p>—</p><p></p><p>In the Central Plains, the battle raged on.</p><p></p><p>The news was immediately sent by messenger pigeon to Gu Yang's hands.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had already returned to the Guangyang Prince's Mansion, silently cultivating and consolidating his own strength, while also commanding the main army and controlling the situation in the entire Qingyun Province.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>The Guangyang Army had already entered the Chiang and Danyang Prefectures, and with the assistance of several Sect Masters, the army was unstoppable, leaving the remaining imperial and rebel armies without any chance of resistance.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, it would not take long for the two prefectures to fall under Gu Yang's control.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>The messenger pigeon arrived with the secret letter.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang opened it, and upon seeing the contents, his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Ji Chunqiu, at the half-step Divine Realm... The imperial house of the Ji clan has hidden their depths quite well!"</p><p></p><p>The contents of the secret letter were about the current events unfolding in the Central Plains.</p><p></p><p>When he learned that the Ji clan had produced five Martial Dao Grand Masters, Gu Yang was already quite surprised, but now that Ji Chunqiu himself was a half-step Divine Realm expert, it left him even more shocked.</p><p></p><p>In an instant,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang recalled the rumors about Ji Chunqiu's illness.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems,</p><p></p><p>Those rumors were merely smokescreens released by the other side.</p><p></p><p>"If this person truly steps into the Divine Realm, perhaps the three-thousand-year cycle of dynastic rule can truly be broken!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm was an existence that Gu Yang was naturally no stranger to. It was a realm that transcended Martial Dao Grand Masters and Transformation Realm experts. Even so-called True Meaning Grand Masters would be insignificant before Divine Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>However, throughout history, Divine Realm experts have been few and far between.</p><p></p><p>But,</p><p></p><p>A half-step is still a half-step.</p><p></p><p>According to the news from the Central Plains, although Ji Chunqiu was a half-step Divine Realm expert, the immortal sects and great families also had profound foundations, and the gathering of various experts in the Central Plains made it difficult for even a half-step Divine Realm to withstand.</p><p></p><p>However, one thing,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang could be certain of.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Ji clan's imperial house were to perish, the other factions likely would not fare well either.</p><p></p><p>A half-step Divine Realm's final retaliation before death would be no simple matter.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang transmitted this news back to the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>Such a major event occurring in the Central Plains, Gu Yang naturally had to inform Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>After taking care of these matters,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression also calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Since he could not intervene in the affairs of the Central Plains for now, he would first focus on conquering Qingyun Province.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>A fragrant breeze blew in his face.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked towards the main hall outside, and a gentle smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Lai'er has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>"My lord."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Lai smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Gu Yang pulled her into his embrace.</p><p></p><p>As for Zhong Lai, Gu Yang was quite fond of her. After all, if he did not like her, he would not have taken her as his wife.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Yang's palm caressed Zhong Lai's abdomen, as if sensing something.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, I wonder if the secret method of the Shenwu Sect has been effective..."(End of chapter)</p>

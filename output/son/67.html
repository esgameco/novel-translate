        <h1>Chapter 67</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Please explain the specific situation!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng glanced at the other mummified corpses, then his gaze fell upon the group.</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, one of the blood refinement realm guards immediately spoke up: "Reporting to the master, starting five days ago, people have been disappearing one after another. We have searched extensively but have found no results.</p><p></p><p>Until today, we found these missing people in a dried-up well. </p><p></p><p>However, when we found them, their entire vital energy had vanished, and their internal organs were hollowed out. We suspect that this may be related to some evil entity!"</p><p></p><p>Evil entity!</p><p></p><p>For the Gu family guards, this was no longer an extraordinary secret. </p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng previously led the Gu family experts to the Qingyang Sect, they had already witnessed the existence of the Qingyang Patriarch, which had given them a glimpse of what sorcerers and evil entities were.</p><p></p><p>Now.</p><p></p><p>With such a bizarre incident occurring here, they could not help but suspect the involvement of an evil entity.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, there is a somewhat similar aura to that of an evil entity, but to say it is an evil entity, we cannot determine that for certain yet," Gu Qingfeng's words immediately caused the expressions of the crowd to change.</p><p></p><p>Although they had already speculated, hearing these words from Gu Qingfeng's mouth still shook them deeply.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the few people and said indifferently, "Tell me where the well where the bodies were found is, I'll go take a look."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir—"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>They headed towards the dried-up well. </p><p></p><p>This place was only within the backyard of the Gu family manor. The moment he stepped into the courtyard, Gu Qingfeng felt a dense, icy cold aura.</p><p></p><p>And when they arrived at the well, this icy cold aura suddenly intensified greatly.</p><p></p><p>Immediately.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng directly leaped into the well, and saw that the well had long dried up, with little trace left on the walls. But the dense, icy cold aura here made him realize that the matter was not that simple.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng came out of the well.</p><p></p><p>"Father, have you discovered anything?" Gu Yang asked first.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head slightly: "I have a lead, but I can't confirm it yet. I will stay here for the next few days, you can continue with your other matters as usual."</p><p></p><p>"I want to see what kind of thing dares to cause trouble right under my nose!" </p><p></p><p>As Gu Qingfeng spoke, his expression had become cold.</p><p></p><p>No matter if it was an evil entity or something else, anything that dared to block his path would have to die.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd all felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>With him personally taking action, there would surely be no major problems.</p><p></p><p>—</p><p></p><p>Thereafter.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng remained within the Gu family manor.</p><p></p><p>As night fell.</p><p></p><p>The sky gradually darkened in silence.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng sat on the roof, majestic and imposing, his eyes closed as if in meditation, with the Demon-Slaying Blade placed beside him.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The sky was now extremely dark.</p><p></p><p>The entire Gu family manor seemed to have fallen into eternal desolation, the surrounding darkness like a raging beast gradually devouring everything, the eerie, icy cold aura reaching its peak at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"It's here!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes grew cold.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not see the evil entity anywhere, relying on the keen senses of a cultivator, Gu Qingfeng could feel that something was staring at him from the darkness.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family manor was now eerily silent.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It must be known that Gu Family Village now has hundreds of craftsmen, and by all rights, it should not be this quiet.</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment, the Slaughter Dagger trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had a premonition in his heart, and the moment he gripped the hilt of the blade, he saw the long sword draw out of the sheath. The chilling sword light, like the dawn, sliced through the dark night, and the terrifying power of blood and qi burst forth with a thunderous killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Ah—"</p><p></p><p>A sword strike cut out.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng only heard a piercing wail, and then the scene before his eyes tore open like a curtain.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that Gu Qingfeng finally realized that he was not actually on the rooftop, but had somehow walked up to the edge of a dried-up well, just one step away from falling into it.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, on the ground of the dried-up well, there were remnants of black ashes, which still carried a cold, ominous aura.</p><p></p><p>But the icy chill that had permeated the backyard had now completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"It's not an evil spirit after all!"</p><p></p><p>"But to be able to silently influence my mind, whatever is here is no ordinary thing—"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the ashes on the ground and the dissipating cold in the air, realizing that he had already dealt with whatever was here.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that this thing could control the mind of martial artists, even those at the Polluted Realm would find it difficult to resist, but it was not particularly powerful itself, as Gu Qingfeng had been able to slay it with a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Gu Qingfeng suspected that even if he did not resist, this thing might not be able to break through his defenses.</p><p></p><p>But regardless, this warning from the Slaughter Dagger had resolved a lot of the troubles.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was increasingly satisfied with this divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng bent down and pinched some of the black powder, feeling a terrifying icy aura emanating from it, as if it could freeze the blood and qi of a martial artist.</p><p></p><p>But in the face of Gu Qingfeng's level of blood and qi, this icy aura seemed rather weak.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it is not an evil spirit. It seems the depths of this world are not ordinary, aside from evil spirits, there are such strange things as well."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng mused.</p><p></p><p>Evil spirits do not die so easily.</p><p></p><p>So he could be certain that this was not an evil spirit.</p><p></p><p>But as for its exact origins, he would need to investigate further to understand clearly.</p><p></p><p>Thereupon, Gu Qingfeng collected the black ashes on the ground, intending to examine them later.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Gu Qingfeng looked around, and the mysterious darkness had completely disappeared. There were now sounds of bustling activity and lights shining throughout Gu Family Village.</p><p></p><p>But just to be safe, Gu Qingfeng still entered the dried-up well to confirm that the icy aura had completely dissipated, only then was he certain that the strange thing had been thoroughly eliminated.</p><p></p><p>The next day, at dawn, Gu Qingfeng summoned Gu Yang and the other martial artists responsible for this area, and said directly:</p><p></p><p>"The thing in Gu Family Village has been resolved by me last night. There is no need to worry about further problems. Additionally, all the deceased craftsmen will be given a hundred taels of silver each as condolence."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Gu Yang's expression relaxed, and then he asked, "May I ask, Father, what was that thing? Could it have been an evil spirit?"</p><p></p><p>"Evil spirits do not die so easily. That thing was slain by me, so it was clearly not an evil spirit. But as for its exact origins, that is still unknown for now."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

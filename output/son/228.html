        <h1>Chapter 228</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Inside the main hall of the Gu family manor, Gu Xiu respectfully bowed to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>In front of his own father, he always had an innate sense of fear and dared not act rashly.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiu only thought that this was his father's suppression of his son's bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"You're back, at the middle stage of the Washing Marrow Realm, it seems you've had your own opportunities these past few days!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded in satisfaction, as if he had just learned of the other's breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's gaze swept over Gu Xiu, and when he noticed the black ring on Gu Xiu's left hand, his brow furrowed slightly, then quickly returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiu said, "I plan to go out and temper myself for some time, and may not be able to return for a long time, so this return is also to bid farewell to Father."</p><p></p><p>"The flower in the greenhouse must eventually weather the wind and rain. That you were able to break through so much in the short time you've been away shows that staying at home is not beneficial for your cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, your mother has missed you for a long time, so since you've returned, go keep her company for a couple of days before leaving."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng waved his hand, just about to hurry him away, when he suddenly thought of something and casually tossed a jade box over.</p><p></p><p>"Inside is something I've prepared for you. If you encounter danger, infuse it with your vital energy, and it can subdue powerful enemies."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiu looked at the jade box in confusion, but still took the item with him.</p><p></p><p>"The remnant soul of a powerful expert..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's gaze became profound. He had just sensed a faint yet terrifying aura from Gu Xiu, which should be the remnant soul mentioned on the information panel.</p><p></p><p>As for what level this powerful expert's remnant soul was, Gu Qingfeng did not know for now.</p><p></p><p>The last time he learned of the cultivation realm of the middle-aged man in purple, it was because he had seen the other's figure in the memory of a fierce beast.</p><p></p><p>But now he only saw the treasure the other was residing in, without truly seeing the existence of the remnant soul. Whether the information panel would reveal corresponding information later, Gu Qingfeng could not be certain.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>the cultivation realm of that remnant soul must not be weak.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was well hidden, and if Gu Qingfeng had not reached the fourth layer of the Dao Palace and his divine sense power had not greatly increased, it would have been difficult to truly discover the other's existence.</p><p></p><p>But since Gu Xiu did not say anything, Gu Qingfeng did not intend to expose the other.</p><p></p><p>As for Gu Xiu's mention of going out to temper himself for a period of time, Gu Qingfeng suspected that the other might be planning to leave the Nine Heavenly Realms.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not stop him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At night, in the bedroom, Gu Xiu opened the jade box left by Gu Qingfeng, and his pupils immediately contracted. Inside the jade box, there was a severed finger lying quietly.</p><p></p><p>The wound of the severed finger was fresh, and the blood seemed to be slowly flowing, as if it had just been cut off.</p><p></p><p>More importantly,</p><p></p><p>the severed finger emanated a powerful aura, with a terrifying might that made Gu Xiu's breathing slow down considerably.</p><p></p><p>"This is what your father has left for you. This severed finger is no ordinary thing. Even a casual Dao Palace realm cultivator would have the possibility of being directly suppressed by it!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the voice of the Supreme Saint of the Extreme slowly sounded.</p><p></p><p>Hearing his words,</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiu's expression changed: "Does the senior mean to say that this severed finger can subdue Dao Palace realm experts?"</p><p></p><p>What is the Dao Palace realm! Gu Xiu naturally understood very well.</p><p></p><p>According to the Supreme Saint of the Extreme's words, in the current末法era, the Dao Palace realm is roughly the top powerhouses in the Primordial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Any Dao Palace realm expert has a distinguished position in the Primordial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore,</p><p></p><p>they are existences that surpass the Divine Change realm.</p><p></p><p>Regarding Dao Palace realm experts, although Gu Xiu had not truly witnessed them with his own eyes, from the Supreme Saint of the Extreme's few words, he could also understand the terrifying nature of this realm.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>this powerful expert's severed finger can directly suppress them.</p><p></p><p>Such a discovery, how could it not shock Gu Xiu?</p><p></p><p>At this time,</p><p></p><p>the voice of the Supreme Saint of the Extreme also became solemn, even with a hint of shock.</p><p></p><p>"Your father is no ordinary person. If this seat has not guessed wrong, he may have already discovered this seat's existence. According to your previous words, your father was only at the Divine Change realm.</p><p></p><p>But now, it seems to be far more than just the Divine Change realm. Even ordinary Dao Palace realm experts in front of him would probably be easily subdued and killed!"</p><p></p><p>"His cultivation is not particularly strong, but his divine sense has reached an unbelievable level, and his vital energy is also astonishingly powerful."</p><p></p><p>"If this seat has not guessed wrong, when the great upheaval comes in the future, your father may be able to ascend to sainthood in an instant, and it would only be a matter of time before he reaches the Great Saint realm!"</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Saint of the Extreme was truly shocked.</p><p></p><p>In his era, the Supreme Saint of the Extreme had seen too many prodigies and monstrosities.</p><p></p><p>There were prodigies who could defeat Dao Palace realm experts with the Divine Change realm, and there were also Half-Saints who could rival true Saints.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>a monster like Gu Qingfeng, the Supreme Saint of the Extreme had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>With the Supreme Saint of the Extreme's cultivation and vision, he was able to see that Gu Qingfeng was currently only at the fourth layer of the Dao Palace realm.</p><p></p><p>But that powerful vital energy and divine soul made the Supreme Saint of the Extreme almost think he was facing a Half-Saint.</p><p></p><p>The fourth layer of the Dao Palace realm!</p><p></p><p>Rivaling a Half-Saint!</p><p></p><p>It could only be described as defying the heavens.</p><p></p><p>If the other were to truly reach the ninth layer of the Dao Palace realm, or even ascend to the Half-Saint realm, subduing Saints would probably be an easy task for him.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Saint of the Extreme's words left Gu Xiu dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>He asked with some disbelief, "Senior, is my father truly this strong?"</p><p></p><p>"Very strong!" </p><p></p><p>The Supreme Saint of the Extreme gave an affirmative evaluation.</p><p></p><p>"With your father's current strength, placed in the Primordial Realm, he would probably be among the truly top-tier, and if Saints do not appear, there might be only a few experts who can match him.</p><p></p><p>This seat originally thought your talent was already strong enough, but now seeing your father's existence, I realize the saying 'the son of a tiger is a tiger' is true.</p><p></p><p>Your future achievements will definitely not be low, but as for your father's achievements, even this seat cannot make a definitive judgment!"</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Saint of the Extreme sighed.</p><p></p><p>With only about one or two thousand years left before the great upheaval, with the other's current cultivation, there would be no problem when the great upheaval arrived.</p><p></p><p>In this era,</p><p></p><p>that person would definitely shine brilliantly.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>the Supreme Saint of the Extreme also felt gratified.</p><p></p><p>As he was now just a remnant soul, if he could establish a good relationship with the descendant of such a powerful expert, it would make it much easier for him to rebuild his physical body in the future.</p><p></p><p>While the Supreme Saint of the Extreme was pondering, Gu Xiu's mind was shaken, unable to recover from the former's words for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Understandably so.</p><p></p><p>Whoever knows that their own father's cultivation has reached the top-tier of the current world would be shocked.</p><p></p><p>All along,</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiu had thought that Gu Qingfeng's peak was just the Divine Change realm.</p><p></p><p>The decline of the Nine Heavenly Realms,</p><p></p><p>according to the Supreme Saint of the Extreme's words, in such an environment, being able to cultivate to the Divine Change realm was already not easy, and wanting to truly reach the Dao Palace realm was as difficult as ascending to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>As a result,</p><p></p><p>his own father not only reached the Dao Palace realm, but was suspected to be a top-tier existence on par with a Half-Saint.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiu looked at the severed finger in the jade box, his expression slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"So this severed finger is also from Father's own body?"</p><p></p><p>"Even Divine Change realm cultivators can regenerate severed limbs. Many geniuses of the Primordial Realm have some precious treasures to protect themselves, but powerful expert's remnant bodies are not often seen.</p><p></p><p>After all, the higher the cultivator's realm, the less their physical body can be damaged. Even if they can regenerate severed limbs, the newly grown limbs cannot be compared to the original.</p><p></p><p>Just take this severed finger for example, for the regenerated finger to be refined to the peak, it would not be a short process.</p><p></p><p>For powerful experts, time is an extremely important thing, so they will not easily damage their own bodies unless necessary."</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Saint of the Extreme's words made Gu Xiu's expression enlightened, and he also felt a bit touched.</p><p></p><p>His father, although seemingly stern, was actually quite concerned about him.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that he was going to leave, he left this severed finger for him to protect himself.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>even though he now clearly understood that Gu Qingfeng's cultivation was very strong, and could be considered a top-tier expert in the current末法era, Gu Xiu still wanted to leave the Nine Heavenly Realms and enter the Five Domains.</p><p></p><p>Because according to the Supreme Saint of the Extreme's words, the Nine Heavenly Realms had scarce spiritual energy, and if he continued to cultivate there for a long time, he would ultimately not be able to compare to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not know how Gu Qingfeng was able to reach this step in the Nine Heavenly Realms, Gu Xiu understood that he himself probably did not have the qualifications to be compared to his own father.</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p></p><p>his father was an expert comparable to a Half-Saint, and he, the son, had not even completed the fifth layer of the Tempering Body realm, which would be embarrassing to say out loud.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiu stayed in the Gu family manor for two days, and finally, under Yu Lian's reluctant gaze and admonitions, set out on the path to the Five Domains.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the esteemed lord, the Third Young Master has left the capital city and is heading towards the Ancient Beast Mountain Range!"</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, Hongye came to report.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded: "You don't need to continue tracking Xiu'er's movements, just keep a close eye on the others coming out of the Ancient Beast Mountain Range."</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>Hongye withdrew after receiving the order.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the main hall, Gu Qingfeng was silent for a moment, then suddenly shook his head and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"The child has grown up!"</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>he looked at the information panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has been guided by a Great Saint realm ninth layer remnant soul, and his strength has improved slightly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' was attacked by a fierce beast *69!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' slew a second layer Refining Impurity beast!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuán' was attacked by a fierce beast *367!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuán' has been guided by a Divine Change realm ninth layer cultivator, and his strength has improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuán' unexpectedly consumed heavenly materials and earthly treasures, and his cultivation has improved slightly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has gained some insights into the Divine Change realm techniques, and his strength has correspondingly improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Shengnan'..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Great Saint realm ninth layer!"</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng saw the first piece of information, his gaze instinctively contracted, as if he had seen something unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the powerful expert's remnant soul on Gu Xiu was not simple, as it had almost managed to evade his divine sense perception, so it was naturally not weak.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Qingfeng never imagined that the powerful expert's remnant soul on him would be a Great Saint realm ninth layer expert.</p><p></p><p>Above Saints, there are Great Saints!</p><p></p><p>In the information left by Maorongxiu, Saints were already terrifyingly powerful, able to establish an eternal sacred land.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The great saints who surpassed the holy ones were truly terrifying in their power and might.</p><p></p><p>"The remnant soul of a great saint!"</p><p></p><p>"Xu has been granted such an opportunity, his future accomplishments will surely be remarkable."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured to himself, comparing the opportunities Gu Xu had obtained to those of Gu Xuan, the latter's opportunities seemed rather lacking. After all, the latter was only following a Shenbian Realm Ninth Layer cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>A Shenbian Realm Ninth Layer cultivator was also not weak.</p><p></p><p>It's just that compared to a Great Saint Realm Ninth Layer expert, they were simply not enough.</p><p></p><p>Even if that Great Saint Realm Ninth Layer expert was just a remnant soul, they would still be far beyond the reach of Shenbian Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Additionally,</p><p></p><p>The fact that there was a remnant soul of a top-tier Great Saint in the Nine Realms was also quite intriguing.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was somewhat curious, whether this Great Saint was a native cultivator of the Nine Realms or an outsider. If it was an outsider, how could they have perished in the Nine Realms?</p><p></p><p>But upon recalling the information he had gathered, Gu Qingfeng suppressed those thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Nine Realms</p><p></p><p>Had many secrets.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' was enraged upon learning that an outsider cultivator had caused trouble in the Nine Realms, and immediately dispatched powerful experts to suppress them!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' increased the defensive forces along the borders of the Nine Realms to stabilize the hearts of the people!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' vigorously developed the Shenwu Academy, strengthening the foundation of the Shenwu Dynasty!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Xuan' unexpectedly obtained heavenly materials and earthly treasures, which led to a certain improvement in his aptitude!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Xuan' gained a deeper understanding of the Heavenly Sword Dao in the life-and-death battles, breaking through the Sixth Level of the Heavenly Sword Dao!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Xu' accidentally encountered an attack by a Shenbian Realm fierce beast, but later used a severed finger to subdue the beast!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Xu' discovered a mature spiritual herb at the site where the Shenbian Realm fierce beast fell!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Xu' cultivated the spiritual herb, greatly improving his cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Xu' broke through to the Xiwu Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +50 Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Xu' reached the peak of the Xiwu Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +50 Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Xu' was attacked by fierce beasts 1369 times!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Xu' entered the Eastern Domain!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Xu' was attacked by cultivators 2369 times!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Xu' was attacked by Zongshi Realm cultivators 19 times!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Xu' was attacked by Grand Zongshi Realm cultivators 6 times!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Xu' was attacked by a Shenbian Realm cultivator, but he used his severed finger to subdue and kill him!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While Gu Qingfeng was in seclusion, he would occasionally check the information panel to keep track of the movements of his descendants.</p><p></p><p>In the beginning,</p><p></p><p>The text appearing on the information panel was still relatively normal.</p><p></p><p>But after Gu Xu entered the Eastern Domain, it was as if he had poked the nest of a certain powerful force, frequently being attacked by numerous cultivators, including Zongshi Realm and Grand Zongshi Realm experts, and even Shenbian Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Just from the over 2,000 attack records of Gu Xu, Gu Qingfeng could clearly understand how treacherous the situation was.</p><p></p><p>"Daring to lay a hand on my son, if I find out who it is, I will definitely go settle the score!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes turned cold.</p><p></p><p>Although currently, it seemed that Gu Xu, despite being attacked numerous times, had not suffered any serious injuries, and the only Shenbian Realm expert who attacked him was killed by the severed finger left behind.</p><p></p><p>But seeing his son being bullied, it was impossible for Gu Qingfeng to not feel angry.</p><p></p><p>It was only because the Eastern Domain was separated by the Ancient Beast Mountain Range that Gu Qingfeng did not immediately go there.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Gu Xu had the remnant soul of a top-tier Great Saint, as well as the trump cards left behind by Gu Qingfeng, so the problem should not be too great.</p><p></p><p>With this in mind,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also calmed down a bit.</p><p></p><p>Being tempered would also have its benefits.</p><p></p><p>As for settling the score, there would be opportunities in the future.</p><p></p><p>During this time,</p><p></p><p>More and more cultivators were also emerging from the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, entering the Nine Realms and causing quite a commotion.</p><p></p><p>For these outer realm cultivators, the Nine Realms cultivators were weak, and they could freely stir up conflicts and slaughter, even killing hundreds of thousands of commoners just to refine a certain precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p></p><p>The Shenwu Dynasty was enraged.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang immediately dispatched Gu Wu and the other three Shenbian Realm Ninth Layer experts to various places to suppress all the troublemakers.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of these four Shenbian Realm Ninth Layer powerhouses finally caused the arrogance of the outer realm cultivators to subside significantly.</p><p></p><p>No one had expected that the seemingly weak Nine Realms would have four Shenbian Realm Ninth Layer experts guarding it.</p><p></p><p>Faced with such strength, the other cultivators naturally did not want to provoke the dynasty.</p><p></p><p>In this way,</p><p></p><p>The Nine Realms regained a certain level of peace.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>These cultivators were still lurking within the Nine Realms, and they were ultimately a hidden danger.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng understood these matters, but for now, Gu Yang seemed able to stabilize the situation, so he had not personally intervened.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>One day,</p><p></p><p>Celestial anomalies appeared.</p><p></p><p>In the Qingyu State, a terrifying celestial phenomenon suddenly emerged, as if a colossal figure stood towering in the sky, with divine light surging towards the heavens, illuminating the night like day.</p><p></p><p>This terrifying celestial anomaly covered a vast area, as if all the people in the state could clearly see it.</p><p></p><p>In the Gu Family Manor,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was also startled by this celestial phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards the empty space in front of him, where the majestic figure stood in the sky, emanating a terrifying aura that shook Gu Qingfeng's spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Daogong Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"No... At least half-Saint level, or even a true Saint!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the figure before him was truly horrifying, indicating the incredible power it possessed in life.</p><p></p><p>And in the memories left behind by Meng Rou, whenever a secret realm was about to manifest, it would be accompanied by celestial anomalies.</p><p></p><p>Now,</p><p></p><p>Such a celestial phenomenon had appeared, clearly in line with the information Meng Rou had left behind.</p><p></p><p>Not only Meng Rou's memories,</p><p></p><p>Han An and that old man Ke's memories also contained relevant information.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that,</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the information left by Meng Rou and extracting the memories of the two from the Guiyuan Imperial Dynasty, even though Gu Qingfeng had been staying in the Nine Realms, he was well-informed about the situation in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Immediately,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stepped into the void, his figure hovering in the sky, his gaze fixed on the celestial anomaly, allowing him to truly see the direction from which it originated.</p><p></p><p>"Outside the Tianxiong Pass!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>And in his line of sight, many cultivators were now heading towards the Tianxiong Pass.</p><p></p><p>These cultivators</p><p></p><p>Included both native Nine Realms cultivators and outer realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that</p><p></p><p>The celestial anomaly outside the Tianxiong Pass had caused a great disturbance.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stepped into the imperial palace to meet with Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Yang had also been startled by the celestial anomaly, and upon seeing Gu Qingfeng's arrival, his grave expression finally eased somewhat.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "The celestial anomaly is likely related to the emergence of a secret realm, and there must be ancient powerful experts' legacy outside the Tianxiong Pass. You should lead people to go there."</p><p></p><p>"I understand, Father!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the words "secret realm", Gu Yang's expression also became heated.</p><p></p><p>His current accomplishments were due to the opportunities he had obtained.</p><p></p><p>Now that such a celestial anomaly had appeared, the power of the emerging opportunity must be immense, and Gu Yang naturally did not want to miss this chance.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said, "With the celestial anomaly manifesting, the Tianxiong Pass will likely be affected as well. Please go to the Tianxiong Pass first to stabilize the situation, so that the outer realm cultivators do not harm our Shenmu people!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded, and then immediately departed into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Qingfeng leave, Gu Yang also immediately mobilized the dynasty's powerful experts and led them towards the Tianxiong Pass.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Celestial anomaly!"</p><p></p><p>"There must be a great opportunity emerging!"</p><p></p><p>In the Ancient Beast Mountain Range, Fu He, upon seeing such a celestial phenomenon appear, was also startled, and immediately led Gu Xuan towards the location.</p><p></p><p>Although Fu He had no particular interest in Saint-level legacies, it did not mean he was not attracted to opportunities.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p></p><p>Fu He had already reached the Shenbian Realm Ninth Layer, which was almost his limit.</p><p></p><p>To break through the Shenbian Realm Ninth Layer and truly enter the Daogong Realm, he would need extraordinary opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Now,</p><p></p><p>An opportunity had emerged.</p><p></p><p>Judging from the celestial anomaly, this phenomenon was at least related to the Daogong Realm, or even higher, so Fu He naturally did not want to miss it.</p><p></p><p>On the other side,</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged cultivator stood in the air, looking towards the direction of the celestial anomaly, his previously calm expression finally showing some changes, his eyes burning with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"The aura is at least half-Saint, or even possibly a true Saint."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, even if I cannot find the Saint-level legacy that the Shenyang Sacred Land once possessed, obtaining this opportunity would still be a worthwhile endeavor!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Yu's heart was also filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>He was a Daogong Realm expert and an elder of a top-tier sacred land, but it did not mean he was not attracted to such opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention Saint-level opportunities,</p><p></p><p>Even half-Saint level opportunities emerging would be coveted by many powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Ancient Beast Mountain Range for a long time, Shi Yu had not gained much, but now that such an opportunity had appeared, how could he ignore it?</p><p></p><p>As Shi Yu headed towards the location of the celestial anomaly, the other powerful experts in the Ancient Beast Mountain Range were doing the same.</p><p></p><p>Once they entered the Ancient Beast Mountain Range,</p><p></p><p>It was as if they had fallen into a quagmire, and it was not easy to truly find a way out.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>When the celestial anomaly appeared, it was like a lighthouse in the vast sea, a guiding light in the darkness, and all the cultivators rushed towards the direction of the anomaly like moths to a flame.</p><p></p><p>Just from the aura emanating from the illusory image, most cultivators could already tell that the emerging opportunity was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Faced with such an opportunity, many cultivators even temporarily abandoned their search for Saint-level legacies.</p><p></p><p>Whether they could find the Saint-level legacies was filled with uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the passage of countless years, finding them would not be easy.</p><p></p><p>But the opportunity that had now emerged was a tangible reality, and the cultivators naturally knew which one was more important.</p>

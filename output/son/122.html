        <h1>Chapter 122</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang listened to the report from the subordinates, his gaze slightly shifting.</p><p></p><p>To slay a Sect Master!</p><p></p><p>And to annihilate a Sect Master!</p><p></p><p>These were two completely different concepts.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, </p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had an idea in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi also cupped his hands and said, "Patriarch, according to the news from the other secret guards, Pei Jing is now recklessly occupying the Liuyun Manor, and it seems the imperial court has no intention of resisting.</p><p></p><p>A large number of combat-ready forces have withdrawn from the Liuyun Manor, and that Taishan County Magistrate may also have some ideas."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's brows slightly raised.</p><p></p><p>"Are you saying that the Taishan County Magistrate is also not loyal to the Great Xuan Dynasty?"</p><p></p><p>"From the current situation, this Taishou Yi does not seem willing to devote himself to the Great Xuan Dynasty!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Yi said.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang immediately fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>After a while,</p><p></p><p>he looked at Gu Yi and asked, "I previously asked you to investigate the situation of Mu Qing. Do you have any news now?"</p><p></p><p>"Please take a look, Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi took out a secret letter from his bosom and handed it to Gu Yang, who opened it and scanned it briefly, his face suddenly revealing a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Great Xuan Dynasty is indeed doomed!"</p><p></p><p>The other nine states may be unclear, but at least the officials in the various prefectures of Taishan County have their own ideas. This secret letter records some hidden information about Mu Qing.</p><p></p><p>After a moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said, "Three days from now, I want to meet that Mu Magistrate!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi took his leave.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, Gu Er came.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>"How is the inventory of all the supplies going?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the other party arrive, Gu Yang's expression also became serious.</p><p></p><p>Gu Er cupped his hands and said, "To report to the Patriarch, all the supplies have been fully inventoried, including about 600,000 taels of silver, 6.84 million taels of silver notes, as well as many antique paintings and calligraphies, with an approximate value of 2 million taels."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a gleam instantly appeared in Gu Yang's eyes.</p><p></p><p>According to the other party's words, the silver notes and silver taels combined were a full 6.9 million taels, and if the antique paintings and calligraphies were included, it would be close to 9 million taels.</p><p></p><p>This was an extremely terrifying number.</p><p></p><p>At least,</p><p></p><p>when the Gu Family Manor previously exhausted all its assets, it did not have as much as 9 million taels.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention 9 million taels, even half of that would be better than what they had.</p><p></p><p>After all, despite the Gu Family Manor being a powerful force in the jianghu, the overlord of the White Stone Dao, and all the major powers bowing to them, their daily expenditures for their many disciples were not small.</p><p></p><p>So, being able to put out 2-3 million taels would already be their limit.</p><p></p><p>And if they used so much money, it might even affect the entire operation of the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>But now it's different.</p><p></p><p>9 million taels of silver, there is more than enough room for maneuvering.</p><p></p><p>"Immediately convert all the antique paintings and calligraphies into cash, then use 4 million taels of silver to purchase grains from various places. This matter must be handled with utmost caution and discretion, so as not to attract the attention of other powers!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said at the end, adding another reminder.</p><p></p><p>If it were in a prosperous era, spending several million taels of silver in one place to purchase grains would cause quite a stir. Let alone now, in this chaotic time when grains are in short supply.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention spending 4 million taels in one place, even tens of thousands of taels would be enough to attract the attention of many powers.</p><p></p><p>But grain procurement is indispensable.</p><p></p><p>In that case, it would require dividing it up, but this would also require...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This approach also adds a considerable amount of risk.</p><p></p><p>However, there is no risk-free way to do anything, and Gu Yang sees this risk as completely acceptable.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang took action.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not intervene.</p><p></p><p>He only occasionally refreshed the information panel to keep track of the other party's movements.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Gu Qingfeng found that the updates on the information panel seemed to be becoming more and more comprehensive. From previously only triggering corresponding prompts when it involved the cultivation and battles of his offspring, to now having additional triggering methods.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' successfully subverted the Prefect of Baishi City, Mu Qing!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has secretly recruited troops and horses in collaboration with Mu Qing!"</p><p></p><p>"The influence of your offspring 'Gu Yang' is gradually expanding!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been extensively purchasing grain in various places!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' learned that grain was being plundered by mountain bandits, became furious, and ordered his secret guards to go and destroy the mountain stronghold!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has broken through the Refine Skin Later Stage!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward increased by 5 points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has made some breakthroughs in cultivating the Gu Family Fist, and his cultivation has improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Shengnan' has refined the marrow, and her talent has improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The information panel now refreshed messages very frequently, with dense lines of text appearing, allowing Gu Qingfeng to be fully aware of Gu Yang and the others, even without leaving his residence.</p><p></p><p>However, when he saw the information that Gu Yang had successfully subverted Mu Qing, Gu Qingfeng's expression also showed a slight surprise.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Alang has already prepared to take action!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Qing was the Prefect of Baishi City, and once he was subverted, it would be equivalent to the entire Baishi City falling under the control of the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, from the information panel, it could be seen that after subverting Mu Qing, Gu Yang used this opportunity to secretly recruit troops and expand his own influence.</p><p></p><p>It can be seen that Gu Yang's actions are progressing in the direction that Gu Qingfeng had anticipated.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, Gu Qingfeng did not plan to intervene too much.</p><p></p><p>Since he understood the true use of the "golden finger", Gu Qingfeng no longer intended to interfere with the affairs of his later generations, as long as it did not affect the foundation of the entire Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>The most normal way to truly stabilize the foundation is to strive to enhance one's own strength as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>The main source of Gu Qingfeng's strength enhancement comes from his later generation offspring.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Qingfeng is now in a completely "hands-off" state.</p><p></p><p>He wants to see whether, by letting Gu Yang freely do as he pleases, he can trigger some useful achievements.</p><p></p><p>With the current accumulation of foundation, as long as he can trigger new achievements, Gu Qingfeng has a 100% chance of breaking through the Sect Master realm.</p><p></p><p>Once he breaks through the Sect Master realm, even if he faces a Grand Sect Master, he would have a chance to contend with them.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng looked at the other information.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiu has broken through!</p><p></p><p>This was within his expectations.</p><p></p><p>After all, both Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu had been cultivating since childhood, and their natural talents were quite good. However, since Gu Xuan broke through first, it shows that his talent is slightly better.</p><p></p><p>Even if Gu Xiu is not as good as Gu Xuan, he would not be too far behind.</p><p></p><p>Given that Gu Xuan had broken through the Refine Skin Later Stage for some time, Gu Xiu following suit and breaking through is also very normal.</p><p></p><p>"With Xuan's and Xiu's talents, they should not take too long to break through the Refine Skin Perfection and Refine Blood Initial Stage as well. As long as they have enough heavenly materials and earthly treasures to assist their cultivation, they can quickly break through."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

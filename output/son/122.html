        <h1>Chapter 122</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang listened to the report from the subordinate, his gaze slightly shifting.</p><p></p><p>Slaying a Sect Master!</p><p></p><p>And annihilating a Sect Master!</p><p></p><p>These were two completely different concepts.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, </p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had an idea in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi also cupped his hands and said, "Patriarch, according to the news from other secret guards, Pei Jing is now recklessly occupying the Liuyun Manor, and it seems the imperial court has no intention of resisting.</p><p></p><p>A large number of combat-ready forces have withdrawn from the Liuyun Manor, and that Taishan County Magistrate may also have some ideas."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's brow slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Are you saying that the Taishan County Magistrate is also not loyal to the imperial court?"</p><p></p><p>"From the current situation, this Taishou Yi does not seem willing to devote himself to the Taixuan Dynasty!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi said.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang immediately fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>After a moment,</p><p></p><p>He looked at Gu Yi and asked, "I previously asked you to investigate the situation of Mu Qing. Do you have any news?"</p><p></p><p>"Please take a look, Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi took out a secret letter from his bosom and handed it to Gu Yang. The latter opened the letter and scanned it, a smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Taixuan Dynasty is indeed doomed!"</p><p></p><p>The other nine states may be unclear, but at least the officials in the Taishan County have their own ideas. This secret letter recorded some hidden information about Mu Qing.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, </p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said, "Three days from now, I want to meet with that Mu Magistrate!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi took his leave.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, Gu Er came.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>"How is the inventory of all the resources?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the other party arrive, Gu Yang's expression also became serious.</p><p></p><p>Gu Er cupped his hands and said, "To report to the Patriarch, all the resources have been fully inventoried. There are about 60,000 taels of silver, 6.84 million taels of silver notes, as well as many antique paintings and calligraphies, with an approximate value of 2 million taels."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a gleam flashed in Gu Yang's eyes.</p><p></p><p>According to the other party's words, the silver notes and silver taels combined were a full 6.9 million taels, and adding the antique paintings and calligraphies, it was close to 9 million taels.</p><p></p><p>This was an extremely terrifying number.</p><p></p><p>At least,</p><p></p><p>When the Gu Family Manor previously exhausted all its assets, it did not have as much as 9 million taels.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention 9 million taels, even half of that would be beyond their means.</p><p></p><p>After all, despite the Gu Family Manor being a powerful force in the jianghu, the overlord of the White Stone Dao, and all the major factions bowing to them, their daily expenditures for the many disciples were not small.</p><p></p><p>So, being able to bring out 2-3 million taels was about the limit.</p><p></p><p>And if they were to use so much money, it might even affect the overall operation of the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>But now it's different.</p><p></p><p>9 million taels of silver, there is more than enough room for maneuvering.</p><p></p><p>"Immediately convert all the antique paintings and calligraphies into cash, then use 4 million taels of silver to purchase grain from various places. This matter must be handled with utmost caution and discretion, so as not to attract the attention of other factions!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang added a reminder at the end.</p><p></p><p>If it were in a prosperous era, spending several million taels of silver in one place to purchase grain would cause quite a stir. Let alone now, in this chaotic time when grain is in short supply.</p><p></p><p>Not to speak of 4 million taels of silver being spent in one place, even tens of thousands of taels would be enough to attract the attention of many factions.</p><p></p><p>But purchasing grain was indispensable.</p><p></p><p>In that case, it would require dividing it up, but this would also present its own challenges.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This approach also adds a considerable amount of risk.</p><p></p><p>However, there is no risk-free way to do anything, and Gu Yang sees this risk as completely acceptable.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang took action.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not interfere.</p><p></p><p>He only occasionally refreshed the information panel to keep track of the other party's movements.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Gu Qingfeng found that the updates on the information panel seemed to be becoming more and more comprehensive. From previously only triggering corresponding prompts when it involved the cultivation and battles of his offspring, it now had additional triggering methods.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' successfully subverted the Prefect of Baishi City, Mu Qing!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has secretly recruited troops and horses in collaboration with Mu Qing!"</p><p></p><p>"The influence of your offspring 'Gu Yang' is gradually expanding!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been purchasing large amounts of grain in various places!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' learned that some grain had been looted by mountain bandits, became furious, and ordered his secret guards to go and destroy the mountain stronghold!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has broken through the post-Refine Skin stage!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +5 Promotion Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has gained some insights into the Gu Family Fist and made progress in his cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Shengnan' has undergone the Marrow Cleansing of the Book of Changes, and her aptitude has improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The information panel now refreshed its messages very frequently, with line after line of text appearing, allowing Gu Qingfeng to be fully aware of the situations of Gu Yang and the others, even without leaving his residence.</p><p></p><p>However, when he saw the information about Gu Yang successfully subverting Mu Qing, Gu Qingfeng's expression also showed a slight surprise.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Alang has already prepared to take action!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Qing was the Prefect of Baishi City, and once he was subverted, it would be equivalent to the entire Baishi City falling under the control of the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, from the information panel, it could be seen that after subverting Mu Qing, Gu Yang had taken the opportunity to secretly recruit troops and expand his own influence.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that Gu Yang's actions were progressing in the direction that Gu Qingfeng had anticipated.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, Gu Qingfeng did not plan to intervene too much.</p><p></p><p>Since he had understood the true use of the "golden finger", Gu Qingfeng no longer intended to interfere with the affairs of his later generations, as long as it did not affect the foundation of the entire Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>To truly stabilize the foundation, the most normal approach was to strive to enhance one's own strength as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>The main source of Gu Qingfeng's strength enhancement came from his later generation offspring.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Qingfeng was now in a completely hands-off state.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see whether, by allowing Gu Yang to do as he pleased, it would trigger some useful achievements.</p><p></p><p>With the current accumulation of foundation, as long as he could trigger new achievements, Gu Qingfeng had a 100% chance of breaking through the Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>Once he broke through the Grandmaster realm, Gu Qingfeng would even have a chance to contend with the Great Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng turned his attention to the other information.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiu had broken through! This was within his expectations.</p><p></p><p>After all, both Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu had been cultivating since childhood, and their natural talents were quite good. However, since Gu Xuan had broken through first, it meant that his talent was slightly better.</p><p></p><p>Even if Gu Xiu was not as good as Gu Xuan, he would not be too far behind.</p><p></p><p>Given that Gu Xuan had broken through the post-Refine Skin stage some time ago, Gu Xiu breaking through as well was quite normal.</p><p></p><p>"With Xuan's and Xiu's talents, they should not take too long to break through the Refine Skin Realm and the Refine Blood Realm, as long as they have enough heavenly materials and earthly treasures to assist their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The promotion points given for breaking through the post-Refine Skin stage and the Refine Skin Realm, as well as the Refine Blood Realm, must be even more!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

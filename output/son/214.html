        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In a brief moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had directly broken through to the fourth layer of the Renjiu Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>The fourth layer of the Renjiu Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>It caused some subtle changes to his physical body, seemingly with a faint golden hue.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng flicked his right hand with his left hand, immediately emitting a metallic clanging sound, leaving only a barely discernible white mark on his physical body, but it disappeared in less than a breath.</p><p></p><p>"The Renjiu Golden Body is truly an unparalleled secret art from the Buddhist sect thousands of years ago. The profundity of this cultivation method is indeed extraordinary. Even with my current cultivation realm, I can further strengthen my physical body!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>His seemingly ordinary finger flick contained enough power to crush mountains and split rivers, but such an attack only left a negligible white mark on the skin, demonstrating the remarkable strength of his physical body.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that,</p><p></p><p>this was only the fourth layer of the Renjiu Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>If he truly entered the complete ninth layer of the Renjiu Golden Body, his physical body would undoubtedly become even more powerful.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately,</p><p></p><p>even the fourth layer of the Renjiu Golden Body was unable to allow Gu Qingfeng to break through to the realm of the Grand Dao Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>After stepping into the realm of the Grand Dao Patriarch, he had embarked on a completely different path.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary martial arts could hardly allow Gu Qingfeng to truly break through. Each of his breakthroughs required the gradual accumulation and precipitation of various martial arts, before he could step by step break through the bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was not in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>As long as he had sufficient cultivation, breaking through to higher realms would only be a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>Over the next month,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng continued to cultivate the Renjiu Golden Body, and he also passed on a martial art called the Qinglian Sword Classic to Gu Shengnan.</p><p></p><p>The Qinglian Sword Classic!</p><p></p><p>It was created by a Grand Master known as the Qinglian Sword Saint six thousand years ago, who had once dominated the world with his unique sword art.</p><p></p><p>However, after the Qinglian Sword Saint's passing, the Qinglian Sword Classic had been lost, until it was recently obtained by Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>Given Gu Shengnan's interest in swordplay, Gu Qingfeng handed the Qinglian Sword Classic to her, allowing her to delve into and cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng would often guide Gu Shengnan in her cultivation of the Qinglian Sword Classic.</p><p></p><p>Although he was not proficient in swordplay, after reaching the realm of true understanding, Gu Qingfeng could easily see through the profundity of other martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Qinglian Sword Classic was an esoteric art of a Grand Master, it was more than enough for him to guide Gu Shengnan.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile,</p><p></p><p>news continued to arrive regarding the situation in the Nine Provinces, as well as Gu Yang's Guangyang Army.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' has conquered the territory of Huangzhou!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by a Patriarch-realm expert *36 times!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' has slain Patriarch-realm experts, and his Tyrannical Saber has reached the initial stage of mastery!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' has slain *1389 rebel soldiers!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' has slain *163 Refining Impurity realm martial artists!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' has slain *13 Demonic Soul-level evil entities!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Shengnan' has gained some insights in the Qinglian Sword Classic, and her strength has slightly increased!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Shengsheng' has broken through to the initial stage of the Refining Blood realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +20 Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Shengan' has broken through to the initial stage of the Refining Blood realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +20 Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Shengsheng' has obtained the Heavenly Saber secret art, and his strength has greatly increased!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Shengan' has obtained the Heavenly Saber secret art, and his strength has greatly increased!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the text on the information panel, and his heart was not particularly stirred.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Saber he had created was rightfully possessed by the descendants of the Gu family. </p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>upon learning that Gu Shengsheng and Gu Shengan were both interested in the saber art, Gu Qingfeng simply passed on the Heavenly Saber techniques to them. Whether they would be able to cultivate it successfully remained to be seen.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>to be honest,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was somewhat unexpected that Gu Yang, with his post-Washing Marrow realm cultivation, could slay Patriarch-realm experts. But upon realizing that he had grasped the Tyrannical Saber and reached the initial stage of the Seventh-level True Meaning, Gu Qingfeng felt at ease.</p><p></p><p>True Meaning was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>For many Patriarchs, the Sixth-level True Meaning was already an unreachable realm. If one possessed the Seventh-level True Meaning, they would be even more powerful.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, although Gu Yang was at the post-Washing Marrow realm, he had been constantly provided with numerous elixirs by Gu Qingfeng over the years, solidifying his foundation, and had also received guidance from many Grand Masters. He also had various fortuitous encounters.</p><p></p><p>With all these factors,</p><p></p><p>slaying Patriarchs did not seem impossible.</p><p></p><p>Flawed martial artists could not be compared to those who had attained the complete martial dao.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Gu Yang has destroyed many ancient sects and families, his ambition is clearly evident. Should the Xie Family truly sit idly by and watch?"</p><p></p><p>In the Xian State, the Xie Family elders had grave expressions.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Guangyang Army growing increasingly powerful, and half of the Nine Provinces already fallen, many in the Xie Family felt threatened.</p><p></p><p>Although Xie Liuyun had already reached an agreement with Gu Yang, the Guangyang Army's methods of destroying sects and families made it clear that many things were at stake.</p><p></p><p>Some elders even believed that Gu Yang's actions were gradually encroaching on the Xie Family.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p></p><p>Xie Liuyun's expression was indifferent: "The current situation does not allow the Xie Family to turn against the Gu Family. Furthermore, I order the rest of the Xie Family to restrain themselves. If any problems arise, I may not be able to protect them.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if you wish to confront the Gu Family, I have no objections.</p><p></p><p>But there is one prerequisite: no one can involve the Xie Family, or else I will destroy you before Gu Yang even needs to act!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke the last part, a murderous intent flashed in Xie Liuyun's eyes, causing the other indignant elders to change their expressions and remain silent.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>Xie Liuyun's expression softened slightly, and then he shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"The Gu Family is powerful, and that Martial Saint is immortal. Even if my Xie Family's Transcendent Realm ancestors were to be reborn, they would still be unable to match him. It is better to endure for now and maintain peace, for how long can ordinary martial artists live?"</p><p></p><p>"Since the Xie Family has already made an agreement with Gu Yang, as long as we act according to the rules, we need not worry about these problems."</p><p></p><p>"After all, the Xie Family is blameless. Even if Gu Yang wants to make a move, he must have sufficient reason to do so!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Liuyun understood that Gu Yang wanted to re-establish the rules, so as long as they followed the rules, he would not act recklessly against the Xie Family.</p><p></p><p>The Xie Family was an immortal clan with many powerful connections behind them.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Yang were to destroy the Xie Family without reason, it would undoubtedly cause a great upheaval, which would not be beneficial for his upcoming plans.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>Xie Liuyun was not worried that Gu Yang would make a false move.</p><p></p><p>He was only concerned that some members of the Xie Family might not listen to his orders and act secretly, and then be caught by Gu Yang, who could then threaten the Xie Family itself.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why</p><p></p><p>Xie Liuyun directly issued a warning.</p><p></p><p>If the Xie Family were to be implicated due to individual actions, then he would have no choice but to abandon them.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was too powerful.</p><p></p><p>He was unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' has annexed the territories of six states, and his forces have greatly increased!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' has annexed the territories of seven states, and his forces have greatly increased!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' has ordered the forging of the Nine Provinces Cauldron!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' has received guidance from a Grand Master, and his cultivation has improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' has broken through to the complete Washing Marrow realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +150 Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 200 Washing Marrow Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 100 Refining Impurity Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' has established a dominating presence over the world, and his army has exceeded 50 million!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' has unexpectedly obtained a mysterious expert's inheritance, and his strength has increased!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Xuan' has gained some insights into the Heavenly Saber's true meaning, and his strength has slightly increased!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Shengnan' has gained some insights into the Qinglian Sword Classic, and her strength has slightly increased!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Shengsheng' has broken through to the middle stage of the Refining Blood realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +20 Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Shengan' has broken through to the middle stage of the Refining Blood realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +20 Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After another year had passed,</p><p></p><p>the Guangyang Army led by Gu Yang had occupied most of the territories of the Nine Provinces, and the overall situation was improving.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had used the accumulated Cultivation Points to directly advance his Renjiu Golden Body to the sixth layer.</p><p></p><p>Two realm breakthroughs in one go.</p><p></p><p>This finally allowed him to break through from the Grand Dao Patriarch's later stage to the complete Grand Dao Patriarch realm.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng was originally just a step away from the complete Grand Dao Patriarch realm, upon truly shattering the barrier and stepping into the complete Grand Dao Patriarch realm, his strength underwent a startling transformation.</p><p></p><p>Qi and blood, like mercury!</p><p></p><p>Capable of suppressing the stars!</p><p></p><p>The power contained in Gu Qingfeng's refined qi and blood had reached a terrifyingly extraordinary level, where each drop of blood held immense power.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng suspected that a single drop of his blood could suppress a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>"I have finally reached the complete Grand Dao Patriarch realm!"</p><p></p><p>Feeling the changes within himself, he had a slight smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Beyond this,</p><p></p><p>the mysteries of surpassing the Grand Dao Patriarch realm were still unknown to Gu Qingfing.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Grand Dao Patriarch realm was his own path, different from the paths of other martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>he could not refer to any examples. </p><p></p><p>He could only gradually unravel the profundities through his own exploration.</p><p></p><p>With the breakthrough in cultivation,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng, unusually, did not continue to seclude himself in the Grinding Pavilion, but instead came out to spend time with Xu Yulan and guide her cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yulan had also been cultivating the Longevity Sutra, and she had almost completely mastered the Washing Marrow chapter.</p><p></p><p>However, to break through the Patriarch's shackles and step into the Grand Master realm, she still lacked a lot.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p></p><p>Xu Yulan's talent was average. </p><p></p><p>Her ability to break through to the Patriarch realm was entirely due to the elixirs.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the elixirs, with her talent, she might not even be able to break through to the Refining Bone realm at this point.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also tested the cultivation progress of Gu Xuan and the others, and he was quite satisfied with their improvements.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>One day, in the main hall,</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan came alone.</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng raised his brow.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan was usually somewhat fearful of him, and he would not normally come to see him alone, as he would at least bring Gu Xiu along.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan smiled awkwardly: "As expected, I can't hide anything from Father's eyes. I have indeed come to seek Father's guidance on a matter."</p><p></p><p>"Speak."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Xuan hesitated for a moment, then cupped his hands and said, "I have been stuck in my cultivation for some time, so I wish to go out and experience some tempering, hoping to find a breakthrough opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"Tempering?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression changed slightly as he looked at Gu Xuan's earnest expression, then nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Your desire for this is good. Being confined within the Gu Family estate has limited your horizons. However, going out to experience tempering also means facing dangers. Are you mentally prepared?"</p><p></p><p>"After all, within the Gu Family estate, no one dares to do anything to you, but once you leave, others may not be as considerate of your identity as the young master of the Gu Family.</p><p></p><p>In fact, your identity may even bring you trouble!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng warned him.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, Gu Xuan's expression was serious: "I have already thought it through. Although it is peaceful within the Gu Family estate, it is not what I truly desire. I hope Father will allow me to do this."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Qingfeng no longer tried to dissuade him.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me."</p><p></p><p>He said to Gu Xuan and then stood up, walking out of the main hall.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan hurriedly followed behind Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Soon,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng led Gu Xuan into the Grinding Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he stepped in,</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan immediately felt a terrifying aura of swords, as if he had been targeted by a formidable presence, and the slight sword intent he had grasped was utterly fragile in the face of this sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan was naturally no stranger to the Grinding Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>However, the number of times he had actually entered the Grinding Pavilion could be counted on his fingers.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was Gu Qingfeng's seclusion place, and others were not allowed to enter casually.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan was puzzled, not understanding why Gu Qingfeng had brought him here.</p><p></p><p>"The divine weapons in the Grinding Pavilion, although not as powerful as the Slaughter Demon Saber, have been tempered by sword intent for years, and are no ordinary weapons. Since you wish to experience tempering, you can choose a divine weapon here to protect yourself."</p><p></p><p>Gu Q</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it felt as if the bloodlines were connected.</p><p></p><p>The divine blade was unsheathed.</p><p></p><p>The icy gleam was chilling.</p><p></p><p>"What a fine blade!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>he also saw two small seal characters on the blade.</p><p></p><p>Bi Kong!</p><p></p><p>The divine blade Bi Kong!</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "The divine blade Bi Kong was the personal saber of Bi Ruhai, a swordsman from three thousand years ago who roamed the jianghu with his half-step grand master cultivation and defeated many powerful experts. </p><p></p><p>It is rumored that in his later years, Bi Ruhai glimpsed the profundities of the grand master realm and became a true grand master of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>But the specifics are not very clear. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>This blade was accidentally found by the bodyguards and later brought back to the Gu manor. Since then, the divine blade Bi Kong has remained in the whetstone hall, its blade intent tempered day and night.</p><p></p><p>Compared to ten years ago, the divine might of this blade has grown even greater!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's words</p><p></p><p>made Gu Xuan even more fond of the divine blade Bi Kong.</p><p></p><p>Bi Ruhai, the swordmaster!</p><p></p><p>This name was completely unfamiliar to him.</p><p></p><p>But since Gu Qingfeng mentioned it, it must be true.</p><p></p><p>This was a divine weapon! And it belonged to a suspected grand master of the martial dao from thousands of years ago! It was clear that the divine blade Bi Kong was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan could also feel the terrifying blade intent surging within it, which, if unleashed, could display earth-shattering power.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng handed Gu Xuan a scroll of secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Blade Nurturing Art. You can cultivate it day and night to align the divine blade Bi Kong with your mind and spirit."</p><p></p><p>After saying that,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng flicked his finger, and a drop of fresh blood fell into the divine blade Bi Kong, making the aura of this divine weapon even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Additionally, I have left a drop of my essence blood in the divine blade Bi Kong. When used normally, it can unleash five strikes that can even slay a grand master of the martial dao."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan expressed his gratitude, his heart filled with a deep sense of security.</p><p></p><p>The divine blade Bi Kong!</p><p>The protection of the essence blood!</p><p></p><p>With such trump cards, he could even retreat unscathed when facing a grand master of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Afterward,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at him seriously and said, "Remember, the human heart can sometimes be the most treacherous. If you are to venture into the jianghu, you must be extremely careful. If you can avoid conflicts, then so be it. But if a conflict arises, you must cut the root and leave no room for retaliation.</p><p>Showing mercy like a woman may ultimately harm you in the end."</p><p></p><p>"I understand, son."</p><p></p><p>"That's good then."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng didn't continue, as many things were better left unsaid - only through personal experience could one truly understand.</p><p></p><p>Two days later,</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan departed the Gu manor, the divine blade Bi Kong on his back.</p><p></p><p>After Gu Xuan's departure, Gu Peng was the first to come and see Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"The second young master has left the Gu manor!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's hand holding the tea cup paused slightly, then resumed as before.</p><p></p><p>"He should go out and see the world. The Gu manor is ultimately too small for him!"</p><p></p><p>"The second young master is venturing into the jianghu alone, and there may be some dangers. Should I secretly send someone to follow him?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng suggested.</p><p></p><p>To be honest,</p><p></p><p>he was also worried about Gu Xuan going out alone.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Xuan was the one Gu Peng had watched grow up, and he had often guided Gu Xuan's cultivation, so their relationship was quite special.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Qingfeng was about to shake his head, but after a moment of contemplation, he changed his response.</p><p></p><p>"I will make the arrangements for this. You don't need to get involved."</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing that Gu Qingfeng would make the arrangements, Gu Peng didn't say much more.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Peng left, Gu Qingfeng summoned a person.</p><p></p><p>"Duobo, pay respects to the master!"</p><p></p><p>"Xuan'er has left the Gu manor to venture into the jianghu. You will follow him and guard his path. Remember, unless it is a life-and-death crisis, you must not truly intervene, and you cannot let him know of your existence."</p><p></p><p>"Understood, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>Duobo remained calm and composed, clasping his fist in acknowledgment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng waved his hand, dismissing him.</p><p></p><p>Duobo was an assassin, a peak Xiantian realm expert, and although he had not truly comprehended the true meaning of the Xiantian realm, he was still a formidable figure in the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>With Duobo guarding the way,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not see it as a major problem.</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan had the divine blade Bi Kong, which had the power to slay a grand master of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>this venture into the jianghu</p><p></p><p>would not pose any significant issues.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has promulgated many benevolent policies, and his virtuous name is spreading more and more widely!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' was attacked by martial artists*426!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' slew a Refining Skin realm martial artist*137!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' slew a Refining Blood realm martial artist*26!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' slew a Refining Bone realm martial artist*3!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' slew a Washing Marrow realm martial artist*1!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' faced a Blood Soul level mysterious attack!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' slew a Blood Soul level mysterious being*1!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' gained insights in the life-and-death struggle, and his strength has grown even greater!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has gained a reputation in the jianghu!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' received guidance from a grand master, and his cultivation has slightly improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' unexpectedly obtained a mysterious expert's inheritance, and his cultivation has greatly increased!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has broken through to the late Refining Bone realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward points increased by 30!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Xuan left the Gu manor, the numerous texts refreshing on the information panel included many related to Gu Xuan himself.</p><p></p><p>Just from the text alone,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng could see that Gu Xuan's journey after leaving the Gu manor was not entirely smooth.</p><p></p><p>In less than half a month,</p><p></p><p>he had already stained his hands with much bloodshed.</p><p></p><p>Especially the most recent incident, where he was suddenly attacked by hundreds of martial artists, and Gu Qingfeng suspected that Gu Xuan might have offended some sect or force, causing them to rise up against him.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was not too concerned about these matters.</p><p></p><p>After all, when venturing into the jianghu, one cannot avoid battles, and it would even allow Gu Xuan to grow.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>seeing that Gu Xuan could break through to the late Refining Bone realm so quickly, Gu Qingfeng understood that Gu Xuan's departure was the right decision.</p><p></p><p>While staying in the Gu manor was comfortable, it also lacked many opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Now,</p><p></p><p>with Gu Xuan out cultivating, although the dangers are not small, his cultivation has advanced by leaps and bounds, breaking through the middle Refining Bone realm to the late Refining Bone realm in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>From Gu Yang,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had already realized one thing.</p><p></p><p>The history of the Nine Provinces was not as simple as recorded.</p><p></p><p>This could be seen from the Zhuangxian Hall as well.</p><p></p><p>In those unrecorded ancient eras, there might have existed even more glorious periods, and although that era has disappeared, there must be many opportunities left behind.</p><p></p><p>Like the Heavenly Dipper Divine Formation! Like the Zhuangxian Hall! Gu Qingfeng suspected that these were remnants from that bygone era.</p><p></p><p>Now,</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan had been in the jianghu for only a short time, yet he could obtain opportunities, which showed that his fortune was also not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise,</p><p></p><p>obtaining opportunities would not be so easy.</p><p></p><p>The next day,</p><p></p><p>the bodyguards brought some intelligence reports.</p><p></p><p>These reports</p><p></p><p>were all related to Gu Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng had given Gu Xuan the freedom to venture into the jianghu and had Duobo secretly guard his path, he could not be completely unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>whenever Gu Xuan caused a stir in the jianghu, the bodyguards would immediately report back.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing the latest reports, Gu Qingfeng understood the situation.</p><p></p><p>It was simple.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan, while traveling in the jianghu, had displayed his profound martial arts and the extraordinary divine blade Bi Kong, which caught the attention of some interested parties.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>there were jianghu forces harboring sinister intentions, wanting to capture Gu Xuan and force him to reveal the secrets of his inheritance, as well as seize the divine blade Bi Kong.</p><p></p><p>But the result was clear.</p><p></p><p>This jianghu force had overestimated themselves and underestimated Gu Xuan.</p><p></p><p>In the end,</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan, relying on his own strength, completely eliminated this jianghu sect.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Gu Xuan still wanted to spare some lives, but remembering Gu Qingfeng's instructions, he simply cut the root without leaving any potential threats.</p><p></p><p>"Well done!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems this brat has taken my words to heart."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled calmly.</p><p></p><p>Since Gu Xuan understood this point, he could avoid many troubles.</p><p></p><p>As for the subsequent events,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's days returned to their usual routine.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had thought that Gu Xu would also follow Gu Xuan out to venture into the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly,</p><p></p><p>Gu Xu was patient enough to remain in the Gu manor, continuing his secluded cultivation, without any intention of going out to the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not force anything.</p><p></p><p>After all, whether to venture out or not is a personal choice, and he would not compel it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the second young master has now entered Lingzhou!"</p><p></p><p>In the Guangyang Royal Palace, Gu Yirou reported.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Yang nodded slightly: "Continue to monitor the movements of my second brother. Also, have someone secretly follow him, but do not intervene unless it is a critical moment."</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yirou clasped his fist and responded.</p><p></p><p>After learning that Gu Xuan had ventured out to the jianghu, Gu Yang immediately arranged for bodyguards to secretly follow him, mainly out of concern that Gu Xuan, being inexperienced, might face some dangers.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>in the past few months,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang found that his worries were somewhat excessive.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Xuan was new to the jianghu, his actions were also cautious and experienced. And with his strength not being weak, even if he encountered some troubles, there was no great peril.</p><p></p><p>At this time,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yirou also said, "Furthermore, I discovered that there seems to be a Xiantian realm expert secretly following the second young master as well!"</p><p></p><p>"This matter need not be addressed. If I'm not mistaken, it should be someone Father has secretly dispatched to guard his path."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression remained calm, as he could easily deduce where the Xiantian realm expert following Gu Xuan came from.</p><p></p><p>Clearly,</p><p></p><p>their father also did not want to leave Gu Xuan to venture alone, so he had sent a Xiantian realm expert to secretly guard his path, which was perfectly normal.</p><p></p><p>Afterward,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yirou presented the intelligence reports from the various states before Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>After the unbreakable sects and families of the Nine Provinces had bowed their heads, and now, more than a year had passed.</p><p></p><p>In over a year,</p><p></p><p>the Guangyang Army had conquered the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>Up to now,</p><p></p><p>eight states had fallen under their control, and the remaining one state, although not yet completely conquered, was only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the great army pressing in, the rebel forces could not stir up much of a storm.</p><p></p><p>"Issue an order to Shizhen, commanding him to subdue the last state within a month!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yirou took Gu Yang's decree and left.</p><p></p><p>Afterward,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang came to the grand hall's map, where the Nine Provinces were displayed. The majority of the territory was now adorned with the banners of the Guangyang Army, with only a few remaining areas not yet fully conquered.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost done!"</p><p></p><p>"It won't be long before the Nine Provinces are all in my hands!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang murmured to himself, his chest filled with grand ambitions.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that</p><p></p><p>in less than ten years, he had developed from a mere 100,000 soldiers to the current state.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the Shenwu King Pei Jing had taken more than a decade to subdue just one Qingyun State.</p><p></p><p>But now,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was about to completely conquer the Nine Provinces in less than ten years.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang also understood the key factor behind it.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial point was due to Gu Qingfeng's influence.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for Gu Qingfeng's suppression of the Nine Provinces, causing the unbreakable sects and families to submit, the Guangyang Army would have needed at least twice the time, if not more, to truly pacify the Nine Provinces and reshape the world.</p><p></p><p>But even so,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang also had the right to be proud of himself.</p><p></p><p>Although he relied on Gu Qingfeng's reputation to achieve such smooth progress, his own methods and abilities were what allowed him to integrate the various states, quell the rebellions, and implement benevolent policies in such a short time - this would not have been possible without his own capabilities.</p><p></p><p>Military force can subdue the world,</p><p></p><p>but to govern the world is another matter entirely.</p><p></p><p>Thinking that it would not be long before the Nine Provinces were completely in his hands, and that he would soon establish his own dynasty, Gu Yang could not help but feel excited.</p><p></p><p>This was only natural.</p><p></p><p>For anyone who has reached this stage,</p><p></p><p>it would be difficult to remain truly calm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the other side,</p><p></p><p>upon receiving Gu Yang's order, the numerous generals led by Shizhen did not hesitate at all, immediately mobilizing their armies for the campaign.</p><p></p><p>Millions of soldiers swept through like a raging wind, sweeping away the rebel forces and warlords as if they were mere fallen leaves.</p><p></p><p>What rebel forces? What warlords? In the face of such absolute power, they were nothing but a joke.</p><p></p><p>When the last rebel general was beheaded, the Nine Provinces had completely fallen under the control of the Guangyang Army.</p><p></p><p>And this</p><p></p><p>was done in just twenty days, shortening the one-month time frame given by Gu Qingfeng by a third.</p><p></p><p>As the</p>

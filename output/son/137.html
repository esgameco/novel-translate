            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"When I reach the perfect refinement of the Five Realms, my strength will have increased even further."</p><p></p><p>"By now, I have entered the realm of the Qi and Blood Grandmaster, but I'm not sure just how powerful I've become--"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>At this point, even he was unsure of the full extent of his own abilities.</p><p></p><p>But there was one thing he was certain of.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng could definitively say that ordinary Grandmasters and Transformation Realm cultivators would absolutely not be his match now.</p><p></p><p>In this vast world,</p><p></p><p>The only ones worthy of his trepidation</p><p></p><p>Might only be the truly ancient existences within the immortal sects and ancestral families.</p><p></p><p>With that thought, </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng turned his gaze to his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng  Age: 42/3000  Realm: Qi and Blood Grandmaster</p><p>Martial Arts:</p><p>Gu Family Fist (Unbreakable Lv.1), Iron Body Technique (Iron Body Lv.1), Great Slab Smashing Palm (Perfected), Iron Leg Technique (Perfected), Forged Steel Fingers (Perfected), Heaven Thunder Sword Technique (Initiate), Hundred Temperings Golden Body (Indestructible Golden Body Lv.9), Seven Killing Blade (Killing Intent Lv.3), Heaven Canopy Invincible Body (Protective Qi Lv.4), Heaven Canopy Divine Body (Inextinguishable Divine Body Lv.1), Pure Yang Technique (9th Layer Perfected, Pure Yang Qi and Blood Lv.8), Five Viscera Classic (5th Layer, Divine Viscera Lv.5), Primordial Treasure Mirror (5th Layer, Viscera Forged as Iron Lv.5), Tyrannical Blade Slash (Mastered, Tyrannical Blade Intent Lv.8), Scarlet Flame Divine Skill (9th Layer Perfected, Scarlet Flame Palm Lv.8), Mysterious Heart Saintly Body (3rd Layer Perfected, Flesh as Jade Lv.2), Great Vajra Invincible Body (3rd Layer Perfected, Flesh as Diamond Lv.2), Prajna Sutra (9th Layer, Prajna True Body Lv.8), Sun and Moon Fist Classic (Not Initiated), Wind and Thunder Blade Technique (Perfected, Wind and Thunder Blade Intent Lv.3)</p><p>Upgrade Points: 263...</p><p></p><p>"Qi and Blood Grandmaster!"</p><p></p><p>"Three Thousand Year Lifespan!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's pupils constricted slightly.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had mentally prepared himself, when he actually saw the change in his lifespan, his heart could not help but be shaken.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the perfect refinement of his viscera, Gu Qingfeng's lifespan had already broken through to two thousand years. Now, upon advancing to the Qi and Blood Grandmaster realm, his lifespan has increased by another thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Now,</p><p></p><p>This is a lifespan of three thousand years.</p><p></p><p>"Transformation Realm cultivators have three thousand year lifespans!"</p><p></p><p>"And now, as a Qi and Blood Grandmaster, I also possess a three thousand year lifespan!"</p><p></p><p>"Combined with the perfect refinement of my body, my current level of existence has undergone another transformation, far surpassing that of mere cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's thoughts stirred, and then he used the Demon-Slaying Blade to cut his palm, allowing a drop of golden blood to flow out.</p><p></p><p>This blood, like liquid gold, contained a terrifying aura, originating from the transformation of his level of existence, not just a simple breakthrough in strength.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this drop of blood, Gu Qingfeng felt a sensation that was both familiar and unfamiliar.</p><p></p><p>The familiar part</p><p></p><p>Was that Gu Qingfeng could sense a power akin to that of demonic entities within this blood.</p><p></p><p>But the difference was</p><p></p><p>This power was fundamentally different from that of demonic entities, even though they existed on the same level of existence.</p><p></p><p>In this moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng understood</p><p></p><p>That he might now possess the ability to slay demonic entities.</p><p></p><p>But--</p><p></p><p>This would need to be verified.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the remaining 200-plus upgrade points and directly continued to improve his martial arts.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Consumed 50 upgrade points! Prajna Sutra broke through to the 10th Layer!...</p><p></p><p>At the moment the Prajna Sutra broke through, Gu Qingfeng only felt a mysterious aura surge forth from within his qi and blood, a true qi that had been nurtured from within his blood.</p><p></p><p>The difference was</p><p></p><p>That the power of this true qi was greater than the true qi that had previously self-generated from the Scarlet Flame Divine Skill.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The power of qi, it has not just increased tenfold.</p><p></p><p>The robust true qi was born and directly devoured the true qi of the previous Crimson Flame Divine Art. This true qi power, without Gu Qingfeng's active guidance, charged towards the dantian.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>The dantian was opened.</p><p></p><p>A new power surged forth from within.</p><p></p><p>"Innate Grandmaster realm!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took a deep breath. The realm that common people could only dream of and vainly wish to break through, he had now broken through in less than a breath.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>The attribute panel had changed again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Realm: Extreme Dao Grandmaster</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Extreme Dao Grandmaster!"</p><p></p><p>"Is this the difference between the true qi and blood qi both entering the Grandmaster realm?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>He was unsure whether this was the change brought about by the true qi and blood qi both entering the Grandmaster realm, or if it was just a change in himself alone.</p><p></p><p>But it was clear.</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Dao Grandmaster he had attained must be far more powerful than an ordinary Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the remaining upgrade points and in one breath, directly upgraded the Prajna Sutra to the thirteenth layer of perfection.</p><p></p><p>With the breakthrough of the Prajna Sutra, a surge of memories emerged, as if Gu Qingfeng had cultivated the Prajna Sutra for hundreds of years, and the true qi in his dantian suddenly became much more robust.</p><p></p><p>This level of true qi robustness was several times stronger than when he had just entered the Extreme Dao Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>At this point.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had perfected the Prajna Sutra, and by conventional martial arts standards, he should now be at the peak of the Innate Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Now, in terms of the Extreme Dao Grandmaster, he naturally had not yet reached the peak of the Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>After all.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng's true qi had broken through, his entire qi and blood power had only just entered the Grandmaster realm and had not yet reached the limit of this realm.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Gu Qingfeng tried to break the limit of the Prajna Sutra's martial arts.</p><p></p><p>But when he saw the required upgrade points for the breakthrough, his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"One thousand upgrade points!"</p><p></p><p>If the Prajna Sutra could be broken through, it would allow him to directly step into the Great Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was clear that the upgrade points required for such a level of breakthrough would be numerous.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that the breakthrough from Grandmaster to Great Grandmaster for the Prajna Sutra would require one thousand upgrade points.</p><p></p><p>After all.</p><p></p><p>The advancement to the Grandmaster realm only required fifty upgrade points.</p><p></p><p>Even the breakthrough to the Great Grandmaster, normally, would only require one or two hundred upgrade points.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>For the martial arts breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>It required a full one thousand upgrade points.</p><p></p><p>Instantly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng abandoned the idea of breaking the limit.</p><p></p><p>"The more advanced the martial arts, the more upgrade points are required for the breakthrough!"</p><p></p><p>"Even for the Great Grandmaster, it is like this. In the future, if I were to break through the shackles of the Great Grandmaster and step into an even higher realm, the required upgrade points would probably be even more."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng never thought that he would be stuck at the Great Grandmaster, even though the Great Grandmaster was the pinnacle of the martial arts world.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>With the attribute panel, breaking through the Great Grandmaster's shackles would not be too difficult, not to mention easy.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng himself had not yet reached that step, so he did not waste time on this matter.</p><p></p><p>The boat will reach the bridge when it arrives.</p><p></p><p>Take it step by step and see!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

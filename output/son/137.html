            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"When I have perfectly refined the five impurities and reached the pinnacle, my strength will have increased even further."</p><p></p><p>"By now, I have entered the realm of the Blood Qi Grandmaster, but I'm not sure to what extent my power has grown—"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, even he was unsure of the exact extent of his own abilities.</p><p></p><p>But there was one thing he was certain about.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was confident that ordinary Grand Masters and Transformation Realm cultivators would absolutely not be his match now.</p><p></p><p>In this vast world,</p><p></p><p>the only ones worthy of his vigilance</p><p></p><p>might be the truly ancient existences from the immortal sects and ancestral families.</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Gu Qingfeng turned his gaze to his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng  Age: 42/3000  Realm: Blood Qi Grandmaster</p><p>Martial Arts: Gu Family Fist (Unbreakable Lv.1), Iron Body Technique (Iron Body Lv.1), Great Tombstone Slamming Hand (Perfected), Iron Leg Technique (Perfected), Forged Iron Finger (Perfected), Heaven Thunder Sword Technique (Initiate), Hundred Temperings Golden Body (Indestructible Golden Body Lv.9), Seven Killing Blade Art (Killing Intent Lv.3), Heaven Canopy Invincible Body (Protective Qi Lv.4), Heaven Canopy Divine Body (Undying Divine Body Lv.1), Pure Yang Technique (9th Layer Perfected, Pure Yang Blood Qi Lv.8), Five Viscera Classic (5th Layer, Five Viscera as Divine Lv.5), Primordial Treasure Mirror (5th Layer, Refine Impurities as Iron Lv.5), Tyrannical Blade Slash (Mastered, Tyrannical Blade Intent Lv.8), Scarlet Flame Divine Skill (9th Layer Perfected, Scarlet Flame Palm Lv.8), Mysterious Heart Saint Body (3rd Layer Perfected, Flesh as Jade Lv.2), Great Vajra Invincible Body (3rd Layer Perfected, Flesh as Vajra Lv.2), Prajna True Sutra (9th Layer, Prajna True Body Lv.8), Sun and Moon Fist Classic (Not Learned), Wind and Thunder Blade Art (Perfected, Wind and Thunder Blade Intent Lv.3)</p><p>Upgrade Points: 263...</p><p></p><p>"Blood Qi Grandmaster!"</p><p></p><p>"Three Thousand Years of Lifespan!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's pupils constricted slightly.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had mentally prepared himself, when he truly saw the change in his lifespan, his heart could not help but be shaken.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the moment he perfectly refined the impurities, Gu Qingfeng's lifespan had already broken through to two thousand years. Now, upon advancing to the Blood Qi Grandmaster realm, his lifespan has increased by another thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Now,</p><p></p><p>this is a lifespan of three thousand years.</p><p></p><p>"Transformation Realm cultivators have three thousand years of lifespan!"</p><p></p><p>"I, as a Blood Qi Grandmaster, also have three thousand years of lifespan!"</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, with my perfected body refinement, my life realm has undergone another transformation, far surpassing that of mere cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's thoughts stirred, and then he used the Demon-Slaying Blade to cut his palm, allowing a drop of golden blood to flow out from the wound.</p><p></p><p>This blood, like liquid gold, contained a terrifying aura, which was the result of the transformation of his life realm, not just a simple breakthrough in strength.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this drop of blood, Gu Qingfeng felt a sense of familiarity and strangeness.</p><p></p><p>The familiarity</p><p></p><p>was that Gu Qingfeng could sense a power akin to that of demonic entities in this drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>But the difference was</p><p></p><p>that this power was fundamentally different from that of demonic entities, even though they were on the same life realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng understood that he might now possess the ability to slay demonic entities.</p><p></p><p>But—</p><p></p><p>this would need to be verified.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the remaining 200-plus upgrade points and proceeded to further enhance his martial arts.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Consumed 50 upgrade points! Prajna True Sutra breakthrough to the 10th Layer!...</p><p></p><p>At the moment of the Prajna True Sutra breakthrough, Gu Qingfeng only felt a mysterious energy surge forth from his blood qi, a true qi that had been nurtured within his blood qi.</p><p></p><p>The difference was</p><p></p><p>that the power of this true qi was even greater than the true qi that had been self-generated by the Scarlet Flame Divine Skill before.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The power of qi, it has not just increased tenfold.</p><p></p><p>The robust true qi was born and directly devoured the original Crimson Flame Divine Art's true qi. Then, this true qi power, without needing Gu Qingfeng's active guidance, charged towards the dantian.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>The dantian was opened.</p><p></p><p>A new power surged forth from within.</p><p></p><p>"Innate Grandmaster realm!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took a deep breath. The realm that common people could only dream of and vainly aspire to reach, he had now broken through in less than a breath.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>He saw that the attribute panel had changed again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Realm: Extreme Dao Grandmaster</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Extreme Dao Grandmaster!"</p><p></p><p>"Is this the difference between true qi and blood qi both entering the Grandmaster realm?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>He was unsure whether this was the change brought about by true qi and blood qi both entering the Grandmaster realm, or if it was just a change within himself.</p><p></p><p>But it was clear.</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Dao Grandmaster he had attained must be far more powerful than an ordinary Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the remaining upgrade points and in one breath, directly upgraded the Prajna Sutra to the thirteenth layer of perfection.</p><p></p><p>With the breakthrough of the Prajna Sutra, a surge of memories emerged, as if Gu Qingfeng had cultivated the Prajna Sutra for hundreds of years. The true qi in his dantian suddenly became much more robust.</p><p></p><p>This level of true qi robustness was several times stronger than when he had just entered the Extreme Dao Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>At this point.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had perfected the Prajna Sutra. By conventional martial arts standards, he should now be at the peak of the Innate Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Now, in terms of the Extreme Dao Grandmaster, he naturally had not yet reached the peak of the Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>After all.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng's true qi had broken through, his entire qi and blood power had only just entered the Grandmaster realm and had not yet reached the limit of this realm.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Gu Qingfeng tried to break the limit of the Prajna Sutra's martial arts.</p><p></p><p>But when he saw the required upgrade points for the breakthrough, his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"One thousand upgrade points!"</p><p></p><p>If the Prajna Sutra could be broken through, it would allow him to directly step into the Great Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was clear that the upgrade points required for such a level of breakthrough would be numerous.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that the breakthrough from Grandmaster to Great Grandmaster for the Prajna Sutra would require one thousand upgrade points.</p><p></p><p>After all.</p><p></p><p>The upgrade to the Grandmaster realm only required fifty upgrade points.</p><p></p><p>Even the breakthrough to Great Grandmaster would normally only require one or two hundred upgrade points.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>For the martial arts breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>It required a full one thousand upgrade points.</p><p></p><p>Instantly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng abandoned the idea of breaking the limit.</p><p></p><p>"The more advanced the martial arts, the more upgrade points are required for the breakthrough!"</p><p></p><p>"Even for the Great Grandmaster, if I were to break through the shackles and step into an even higher realm, the required upgrade points would likely be even more."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng never thought that he would be stuck at the Great Grandmaster realm, even though it was currently the pinnacle of the martial arts world.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>With the attribute panel, breaking through the Great Grandmaster's shackles would not be too difficult, not to mention effortless.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng himself had not yet reached that step, so he did not waste time on this matter.</p><p></p><p>The boat will reach the bridge when it arrives.</p><p></p><p>Take it step by step and see!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

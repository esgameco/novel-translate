        <h1>Chapter 210</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You've also cultivated a Forbidden Area!!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing his own Forbidden Area shattered, Fu Zhao was like seeing something terrifying, the previous air of assured victory had disappeared, replaced by a face full of horror.</p><p></p><p>After all, </p><p></p><p>To break through a Forbidden Area, </p><p></p><p>It requires either absolute power, or using the Forbidden Area to break the Forbidden Area.</p><p></p><p>To say that Gu Qingfeng's strength had completely crushed him, and could easily shatter his Forbidden Area, Fu Zhao absolutely did not believe it.</p><p></p><p>So, </p><p></p><p>The first thing he thought of was the Forbidden Area.</p><p></p><p>But very soon,</p><p></p><p>Fu Zhao realized something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>"No... this is not the power of a Forbidden Area, just who are you—"</p><p></p><p>Fu Zhao was a bit frantic.</p><p></p><p>"I am Gu Qingfeng!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said calmly, then with a thought, the Heaven Sword Domain swept across the area, the terrifying sword qi surging towards Fu Zhao like a tidal wave.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Forbidden Area,</p><p></p><p>In Gu Qingfeng's view, was essentially of the same nature as the True Meaning Domain.</p><p></p><p>But the difference was,</p><p></p><p>The True Meaning Domain was far more powerful than the so-called Forbidden Area.</p><p></p><p>As you can see,</p><p></p><p>The Forbidden Area that Fu Zhao had painstakingly condensed was easily torn apart by the first-grade Heaven Sword Domain.</p><p></p><p>From this, one can see the huge gap between the Forbidden Area and the True Meaning Domain.</p><p></p><p>"No matter who you are, you will die today!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the terrifying sword qi rushing towards him, Fu Zhao's face turned ferocious, his powerful spiritual power erupting, the evil phantom behind him almost solidifying, the bizarre and icy power exploding, with a snap of his fingers it had the momentum to destroy the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The sword qi was shattered.</p><p></p><p>After all, Fu Zhao had reached the Transcendent Realm, possessing power that surpassed Grand Dao Masters and Transformation Realm cultivators, the ordinary sword qi of the Heaven Sword Domain posed little threat to him.</p><p></p><p>But this scene, in Fu Zhao's eyes, was a display of Gu Qingfeng's insufficient strength.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Zhao's eyes turned ruthless, his palm once again pressing down towards Gu Qingfeng, the terrifying abyss-like power causing the space to crack like a spider web, as if it would shatter at any moment.</p><p></p><p>This time, Gu Qingfeng finally moved his right hand, and a finger strike seemed to cleave the heavens and the earth with a dazzling sword beam.</p><p></p><p>The power of a single finger strike,</p><p></p><p>Was like shattering the starry river.</p><p></p><p>This power easily dissolved Fu Zhao's attack, and the lingering force surged towards the opponent, causing the latter's expression to change.</p><p></p><p>"Boom—"</p><p></p><p>Fu Zhao activated his spiritual power to resist, but in the next moment, he saw the spiritual power shield shatter, the powerful force directly sending him flying back.</p><p></p><p>When he stabilized his body, Fu Zhao's face was full of shock, even with his bleeding arm, he didn't pay any attention to it.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, I have already reached the middle stage of the Transcendent Realm, even if the Ancestral Martial Saint was reborn a million years ago, he could not be my opponent!!"</p><p></p><p>This time,</p><p></p><p>Fu Zhao was truly shocked.</p><p></p><p>His full-power strike was unable to withstand Gu Qingfeng's casual strike.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the Transcendent Realm had become a joke.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head slightly: "If this is the power of the Transcendent Realm, then I have indeed overestimated you!"</p><p></p><p>"Well, this battle is no longer necessary to continue—"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell,</p><p></p><p>The long sword behind Gu Qingfeng suddenly unsheathed, he grasped the hilt with his right hand, activating his two great celestial veins, a terrifyingly powerful aura erupting.</p><p></p><p>The Sword of Slaying Evil descended upon many.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Sword Qi cleaved the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>The majestic divine might made it difficult for anyone to have the slightest urge to resist.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Heavenly Sword Qi entering his vision, a terror he had never experienced before swept over him, causing fear to appear in Fu Zhao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after,</p><p></p><p>His expression became ruthless, with a touch of the madness of facing certain doom.</p><p></p><p>"I have cultivated for thousands of years to reach the Transcendent Realm, how dare you, a junior, contend with me!!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Zhao's expression turned ferocious, various bizarre patterns appearing on his body, the terrifying icy aura freezing the void, a sign that the evil phantom was about to revive.</p><p></p><p>Normally, Fu Zhao would not act so recklessly.</p><p></p><p>But faced with Gu Qingfeng's sword, he had no confidence in blocking it.</p><p></p><p>The revival of the evil phantom was just a possibility, and there was still a chance to suppress it afterwards, but if he perished here, it would be the end of everything.</p><p></p><p>"Boom—"</p><p></p><p>The evil phantom in the void merged with Fu Zhao, the peak power of the Transcendent Realm striking out, the spider web-like space suddenly shattering.</p><p></p><p>This strike,</p><p></p><p>Was Fu Zhao's desperate all-out attack.</p><p></p><p>The moment the two forces collided, the Heavenly Sword Qi broke through effortlessly, the terrifying sword beams seemingly splitting the entire sky in half.</p><p></p><p>After the space shattered, the blackness surged through the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>Fu Zhao's physical body also exploded instantly, scattering into a mist of blood.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>With Fu Zhao's death, the evil phantom within him also revived.</p><p></p><p>But before the evil phantom could act, it was directly slain on the spot by the lingering sword qi.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble rumble—"</p><p></p><p>This sword stretched across hundreds of miles.</p><p></p><p>The sun and moon dimmed.</p><p></p><p>When the Heavenly Sword Qi finally dissipated, only the surging blackness remained, slowly healing completely under the stunned and horrified gazes of everyone.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Silence! The battlefield of millions of troops was now in a deathly silence!</p><p></p><p>Everyone was looking at the figure in the sky, their expressions a mix of shock, but more of terror.</p><p></p><p>Slicing through space for hundreds of miles, this was beyond what human power could achieve.</p><p></p><p>Only the legendary immortal gods were said to possess such power.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Grand Master Taixuan, upon seeing Fu Zhao slain by Gu Qingfeng, and that sword that stretched across hundreds of miles, caused the Sect Master of Taixu Sect to tremble in fear.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even care about the presence of the Sword Dao Cultivator, directly spitting out a mouthful of blood and fleeing the battlefield like a rainbow.</p><p></p><p>Burning blood to form a rainbow!</p><p></p><p>This was a technique only used when facing certain doom.</p><p></p><p>Grand Master Taixuan fled so quickly that even the Sword Dao Cultivator couldn't stop him in time.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stood in the air, looking in the direction Grand Master Taixuan fled, casually slashing out a sword qi that once again broke through the void, instantly cleaving Grand Master Taixuan in half.</p><p></p><p>The mighty Sect Master of Taixu Sect, in the face of the current Gu Qingfeng, was no different from an ant.</p><p></p><p>With the death of Grand Master Taixuan, the previously silent battlefield erupted in slaughter once more.</p><p></p><p>General Shizhen and other Guangyang Army commanders personally led their troops to attack the Ling King's army, who had now lost morale after witnessing Gu Qingfeng's terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stepped forward, heading straight for the main camp.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Ling King's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Stop him!! Quickly stop him!!!"</p><p></p><p>The usually calm Ling King, upon seeing Gu Qingfeng approaching, found it difficult to remain composed.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the order, many guards rushed forward, trying to block Gu Qingfeng's path.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment,</p><p></p><p>The Heaven Sword Domain descended.</p><p></p><p>Endless sword qi slashed.</p><p></p><p>Whether they were Sect Master realm experts or armored guards, they were all directly slashed to death by the sword qi.</p><p></p><p>In less than a breath,</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred guards were killed.</p><p></p><p>The others who wanted to step forward to block him, upon seeing this scene, instinctively stopped.</p><p></p><p>The way they looked at Gu Qingfeng was as if they were seeing a ghost.</p><p></p><p>"So you are the Ling King?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the middle-aged man in front of him and slowly asked.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Ling King's expression fluctuated, but after a moment, he regained his composure, took a deep breath, and said in a forced calm manner.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder you are the Martial Saint personally enfeoffed by the Great Xuan Dynasty, your strength is even more terrifying than the rumors. Now that the winner has been decided, there is nothing more to say, I, the King, am willing to accept my defeat!"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, the Ling King's mouth revealed a bitter smile, also deeply feeling his own powerlessness.</p><p></p><p>What use were his hundred thousand troops?</p><p></p><p>In the face of a true expert, a hundred thousand troops were nothing but illusions.</p><p></p><p>To be honest,</p><p></p><p>The Ling King was not reconciled.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had already crushed the other warlords, and if it weren't for Gu Qingfeng's intervention, defeating Gu Yang would not have been a problem.</p><p></p><p>The opportunity to unify the Nine Provinces was right in front of him, but now it was like an insurmountable chasm.</p><p></p><p>"Then I shall send you on your way."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not waste any words, raising his hand to strike out a palm, the Ling King and the surrounding guards' physical bodies exploded into a mist of blood, dying instantly.</p><p></p><p>The process of slaying the Ling King was without any obstacles.</p><p></p><p>In fact,</p><p></p><p>In the face of absolute power, many things could be directly ignored.</p><p></p><p>With the Ling King's death,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng stepped into the void, his terrifying aura fully erupting, dominating the area, and then he shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>"The Ling King is dead, those who surrender will not be killed!"</p><p></p><p>These words immediately threw the Ling King's army into chaos.</p><p></p><p>The hundreds of thousands of troops were scattered in various directions, not everyone could witness the scene of the Ling King's death with their own eyes, but Gu Qingfeng's previous awe-inspiring display of slaying Fu Zhao suddenly hearing his words caused them to lose their composure.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression brightened, and he immediately shouted loudly: "The Ling King is dead, those who surrender will not be killed!"</p><p></p><p>Following Gu Yang's words, shouts also came from the Guangyang Army.</p><p></p><p>"The Ling King is dead, those who surrender will not be killed!"</p><p>"The Ling King is dead, those who surrender will not be killed!"</p><p>"The Ling King..."</p><p></p><p>These shouts like waves rolled across the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Ling King's army still had some doubts, but now the news of the Ling King's death had entered their minds, causing them to waver.</p><p></p><p>But soon,</p><p></p><p>The news of the Ling King's death spread even more.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the fierce attack of the Guangyang Army, some could not withstand the pressure and directly threw down their weapons to surrender.</p><p></p><p>"I surrender!"</p><p>"Don't kill me, I surrender!"</p><p></p><p>Now the Ling King's army had fallen into a state of complete demoralization, as one by one they threw down their weapons and surrendered, this spread like a contagion.</p><p></p><p>Seeing more and more people surrendering, some loyal Ling King commanders immediately beheaded a soldier, roaring angrily.</p><p></p><p>"Anyone who disturbs the army's morale will be killed without exception—"</p><p></p><p>Before he could even finish his words, Gu Qingfeng simply flicked his finger, a gust of wind broke through the air, causing the commander's head to explode.</p><p></p><p>For Gu Qingfeng now, Sect Master realm experts could be casually slain with a single strike.</p><p></p><p>After slaying this Sect Master commander,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked coldly across the battlefield and shouted in a stern voice, "Whoever wants to die, I can oblige you."</p><p></p><p>At these words, some of the loyal generals of the Ling King were filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't be helped. The strength between the two sides was simply on completely different levels.</p><p></p><p>The strength they were proud of was like a joke in the face of Gu Qingfeng, who could easily destroy them with a wave of his hand.</p><p></p><p>So this battle had no suspense at all.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain 693 ordinary soldiers!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by a Grandmaster-realm cultivator 13 times!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain 36 Refining Impurities realm cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain 127 Washing Marrow realm cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has led the army to defeat the Ling King and recruited a large number of surrendering troops, greatly increasing his forces!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has achieved a great victory at the Tianxiong Pass, greatly increasing his prestige!"</p><p></p><p>In the Gu family manor, Gu Qingfeng looked at the constantly updating text messages, and his heart was much calmer.</p><p></p><p>It had been three days since the battle at Tianxiong Pass.</p><p></p><p>Three days ago, Gu Qingfeng had slain Fu Zhao and the Taixuan Master at Tianxiong Pass, and then annihilated the Ling King, laying the foundation for the Guangyang Army's victory.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng did not interfere much in Gu Yang's takeover of the Ling King's army, but directly returned to the Gu family manor.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Qingfeng had already resolved the biggest obstacle, and he believed that Gu Yang had the ability to handle the remaining issues.</p><p></p><p>However, the hundreds of millions of troops under the Ling King's command could not all truly surrender.</p><p></p><p>So in the past few days, the information panel showed that Gu Yang had been slaughtering relentlessly, and almost all those who did not submit had become victims of his blade.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had no objections to this approach.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the last piece of information, Gu Qingfeng realized that the hundreds of millions of defeated troops brought by the Ling King had been completely controlled by Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>"By swallowing the Ling King's hundreds of millions of troops, Alang's forces have at least doubled. Now that Fu Zhao has perished, the unparalleled sects in the world probably no longer dare to make a move.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the Nine Provinces of the world will truly belong to the Gu family!"</p><p></p><p>Even though Gu Qingfeng's temperament had become less volatile, he could not help but feel somewhat unsettled at this moment.</p><p></p><p>There was a time when Gu Qingfeng had never thought that the Gu family would have the qualifications to dominate the world.</p><p></p><p>But now, this situation, barring any unexpected events, meant that the Guangyang Army would soon establish its rule over the Nine Provinces, it was just a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng continued to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>The battle with Fu Zhao had allowed him to witness the techniques of the Transcendent Realm, but to be honest, Gu Qingfeng was somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>The Transcendent Realm was indeed powerful, much stronger than the Grand Martial Masters, and even more formidable than the evil entity from the Blood Mountain Mansion in the past.</p><p></p><p>However, that was about it.</p><p></p><p>The climactic and thrilling battle he had imagined did not truly materialize, as Gu Qingfeng had simply slain Fu Zhao with a single stroke when he was truly serious.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, Gu Qingfeng was still eager to further enhance his own strength.</p><p></p><p>After all, there are always higher realms beyond the sky, and people beyond the people. After obtaining that mysterious drop of blood and the severed finger, Gu Qingfeng realized that the Nine Provinces were ultimately too small, and perhaps there were even more expansive realms outside of it.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the owner of that drop of blood or the owner of the severed finger, their strength was far beyond what a mere Transcendent Realm cultivator like Fu Zhao could match.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, even though Gu Qingfeng had slain Fu Zhao, he did not feel proud and complacent.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While Gu Qingfeng was in seclusion, the battle at Tianxiong Pass had spread like a hurricane throughout the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who learned of this news had their expressions change drastically.</p><p></p><p>Especially the various immortal sects and noble families, when they first heard this news, they thought they had misheard.</p><p></p><p>But when they confirmed again and again that Fu Zhao had indeed been slain by Gu Qingfeng at Tianxiong Pass, they finally accepted this incredible fact.</p><p></p><p>"Fu Zhao is dead!"</p><p></p><p>"The mighty Transcendent Realm cultivator was no match for a mere martial artist!"</p><p></p><p>In the Xian State, the current patriarch of the Ji Family, Ji Liuyun, had his usually composed expression change greatly upon hearing this news.</p><p></p><p>He was well aware of how formidable the Transcendent Realm was.</p><p></p><p>The Ji Family had once produced a Transcendent Realm expert in the past. Although that Transcendent Realm ancestor had already passed away, his legacy and power were still far beyond the reach of the Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even the so-called Half-step Transcendent Realm cultivators were insignificant in the face of a true Transcendent Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>Precisely because Ji Liuyun understood the power of the Transcendent Realm, he could clearly see what Gu Qingfeng's ability to slay Fu Zhao truly represented.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the other Ji Family elders also had grim expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Now that the news of Fu Zhao's death has spread throughout the world, Master, how do you think we should proceed?"</p><p></p><p>One of the Ji Family elders asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>If the Taigu Sect had produced a Transcendent Realm expert, the Ji Family could still barely accept it. But with the news of the battle at Tianxiong Pass, they were completely caught off guard.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was not a cultivator, but a martial artist.</p><p></p><p>This was not just a matter of who would control the Nine Provinces, but also a question of the status between the cultivator and martial artist systems.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the measures Gu Qingfeng had taken in the past in Guangyang Prefecture, as well as the policies Gu Yang had implemented in Qingyun State, which were extremely unfriendly to cultivators, the implications were profound.</p><p></p><p>If the cultivators were still the supreme ones, it would be a different matter.</p><p></p><p>But now a peerless expert had emerged from the martial artists, the meaning was different.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, Gu Qingfeng's slaying of Fu Zhao meant that even if the Ji Family produced a Transcendent Realm expert, they might not necessarily be a match for him.</p><p></p><p>Ji Liuyun's expression fluctuated, and it took him a moment before he let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Martial Ancestor passed away, the martial artists have been in a weak position for countless generations. Now with the appearance of Gu Qingfeng, perhaps it is the turning of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>With Fu Zhao's demise and the Taixuan Master's fall in Qingyun State, the great tide has completely fallen into Gu Yang's hands.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Ji Family exhausts all its resources, resisting that person would be like an egg hitting a rock!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Liuyun said this with great resignation, but there was nothing he could do about it.</p><p></p><p>Because the facts were just as such.</p><p></p><p>When the news of the battle at Tianxiong Pass spread, Ji Liuyun realized that the Ji Family's prospects had already been ruined.</p><p></p><p>Not only the Ji Family, but all the cultivator sects in the world were in the same situation.</p><p></p><p>At this point, not only the Ji Family, even ten Ji Families, if they were to become enemies of Gu Qingfeng, they would be instantly annihilated.</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Ji Liuyun paused for a moment, and then said with resignation, "I will personally go to Qingyun State. As long as the Ji Family is willing to submit, I believe that the Guangyang King will not slaughter us to the last.</p><p></p><p>After all, the lifespan of martial artists is limited. If we really tear off the mask, by the time that Martial Saint passes away, the consequences will not be so simple."</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Ji Liuyun's gaze became more ruthless.</p><p></p><p>He did not want to fight to the death with the Gu family, but that did not mean the Ji Family was truly afraid of them.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Ji Family of the Xian State had stood for countless generations, and its foundations were not as simple as they appeared on the surface.</p><p></p><p>It's just that some things, when it's time to yield, one should yield, there's no need to fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the main reason was that the lifespan of martial artists was limited.</p><p></p><p>As powerful as the Martial Ancestor in the past, he only lasted about two thousand years before directly passing away.</p><p></p><p>Two thousand years, not too short, but not too long either.</p><p></p><p>As long as Gu Qingfeng passed away, in Ji Liuyun's view, no one else would be able to stir up any waves.</p><p></p><p>After all, for someone to reach Gu Qingfeng's level in the Martial Dao, it was rare to see even one in thousands of years, the Martial Dao was arduous, and Ji Liuyun was not worried that there would be a second Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ji Liuyun's words, the other Ji Family elders also relaxed their expressions.</p><p></p><p>Indeed.</p><p></p><p>The lifespan of cultivators was much longer than that of martial artists. As long as they outlived that Martial Saint, the Ji Family would always have a chance to make a comeback.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While the Xian State Ji Family was taking action, the other immortal sects across the various states were also taking similar measures.</p><p></p><p>Anyone with clear eyes could see that with Fu Zhao's death, the might of Gu Yang, the Guangyang King, was unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>At this time, if they continued to be enemies with him, it would be like an egg hitting a rock.</p><p></p><p>Even if the immortal sects and noble families had strong foundations, they were not so foolish as to waste themselves.</p><p></p><p>Enduring for the time being, and let the Martial Saint live out his days.</p><p></p><p>A mere two thousand years was nothing to these sects and families with legacies spanning countless generations.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, many martial artists across the world, upon learning the news of Gu Qingfeng's slaying of Fu Zhao, were flocking towards Qingyun State.</p><p></p><p>Even some reclusive experts were unable to restrain themselves.</p><p></p><p>Slaying Fu Zhao! This showed that the cultivators could no longer suppress the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Gu Qingfeng's performance in this battle was enough to convince others that his cultivation was sufficient to become the second Martial Ancestor, or even stronger than the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>If they could obtain some guidance from him, perhaps the path of the Martial Dao would be smooth sailing in the future.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this was the reason why these martial artists were heading to Qingyun State.</p><p></p><p>However, they also understood that they were not qualified to directly meet Gu Qingfeng. Thus, these people chose to join Gu Yang's forces instead, hoping to seize the opportunity to eventually meet Gu Qingfeng in the future.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Gu Yang was rapidly dispersing the original Ling King's army and integrating them into the various divisions of the Guangyang Army.</p><p></p><p>In just half a month, Gu Yang had completed the expansion and reorganization of the entire army.</p><p></p><p>Then, he ordered the army to march to the various states.</p><p></p><p>With the Ling King's defeat and the influx of martial artists coming to join him, Gu Yang understood that the future of the Nine Provinces was now in his hands.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that the battle at Tianxiong Pass had already laid the foundation for the future of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>At such a time, Gu Yang naturally had no hesitation, directly ordering his generals to lead the armies and march towards the various states.</p><p></p><p>The various state lords had already been defeated in the Central State.</p><p></p><p>Now with the Ling King's demise, the other states no longer had much resistance to offer.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Yang's eyes, this world was within his grasp.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The True Scriptures of the Heavenly Meridian (First Layer)!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked inwardly at his own body, and saw that blood-colored meridians had already condensed within his body. These meridians were different from the other meridians in his body, and they were also filled with a primitive and ancient aura.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Meridian!</p><p></p><p>This was the Heavenly Meridian spoken of in the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Meridian.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the profound and mysterious aura within the Heavenly Meridian, it was just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p></p><p>At that moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng tried to activate the Heavenly Meridian.</p><p></p><p>In an instant,</p><p></p><p>the Heavenly Meridian began to tremble.</p><p></p><p>An unprecedented powerful force awakened from within the Heavenly Meridian, as if it was connected to the heavens and the earth. In a flash, Gu Qingfeng's physical body and qi blood had already surged.</p><p></p><p>After a moment,</p><p></p><p>this force gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng let out a long breath, his face unable to conceal his excitement.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Heavenly Meridian!"</p><p></p><p>"This meridian can connect to the heavens and the earth, and borrow the power of the heavens and the earth. No wonder cultivating the Heavenly Meridian can greatly increase a cultivator's strength, it's actually like this!!"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Meridian, the Heavenly Meridian!</p><p></p><p>The most important thing is the "Heavenly" part.</p><p></p><p>This meridian can connect to the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>In that moment when he activated the Heavenly Meridian just now, Gu Qingfeng experienced the mighty and majestic power from the heavens and the earth for the first time.</p><p></p><p>According to the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Meridian, each time a Heavenly Meridian is condensed, one's own strength can be doubled.</p><p></p><p>Before truly entering the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Meridian, Gu Qingfeng had doubts about this.</p><p></p><p>But now,</p><p></p><p>he no longer had any doubts.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the powerful force of the Heavenly Meridian, it was clear that the descriptions in the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Meridian were not false at all.</p><p></p><p>After the shock,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression also changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"With the powerful True Scriptures of the Heavenly Meridian, the strong experts who created this martial art in the past must be unfathomable existences, at least at the Grand Master level."</p><p></p><p>"And if such powerful experts were to condense all nine Heavenly Meridians, they would be able to dominate the world with little resistance."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had truly experienced the power of the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Meridian.</p><p></p><p>He was also quite curious about who created the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Meridian.</p><p></p><p>Normally,</p><p></p><p>if someone created the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Meridian, they would not be an unknown figure.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>there have been many powerful experts throughout history, but Gu Qingfeng had never heard of the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Meridian before.</p><p></p><p>But from the current situation, since Grand Masters can live for 800 years, perhaps the powerful expert who created the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Meridian has already passed away.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng temporarily set aside this matter.</p><p></p><p>The origins of the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Meridian and who created it are not that important to him right now.</p><p></p><p>What's truly important is,</p><p></p><p>the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Meridian can indeed strengthen his own power, and that is enough.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at his attribute panel again, wanting to see how many points he would need to upgrade the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Meridian to the second layer.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment,</p><p></p><p>his brows furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"One thousand upgrade points!"</p><p></p><p>"Ten-fold amplification--"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's pupils constricted.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that it only required 100 upgrade points to start with the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Meridian, he already knew that if he wanted to continue upgrading, he would need to use a lot of upgrade points.</p><p></p><p>One thousand upgrade points,</p><p></p><p>just to condense the second Heavenly Meridian.</p><p></p><p>Clearly,</p><p></p><p>this was already comparable to the martial arts of Grand Masters breaking their limits.</p><p></p><p>From this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng suspected that the level of the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Meridian was likely even higher than Grand Master martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately,</p><p></p><p>the attribute panel so far had not shown the ability to display the level of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>regarding the level of the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Meridian, Gu Qingfeng could only hold a speculative idea.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The meditation session was over, so he continued his closed-door cultivation.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>"I've broken through to the Refine Bone Realm!"</p><p></p><p>In the secret chamber, Gu Yang opened his eyes, and a fierce killing intent burst forth from his eyes, exuding an overbearing and solemn aura that made others feel dread.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the Refine Bone Realm.</p><p></p><p>He did not feel as excited as he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>It was as if this level of breakthrough was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was indeed the case.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang had never doubted that he could break through to the Refine Bone Realm.</p><p></p><p>His goal...</p><p></p><p>At the very least, it was the Patriarch realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, his father was a renowned Patriarch in the world, and although Gu Yang could not match his father, he should still be able to break through to the Patriarch realm.</p><p></p><p>If it had been in the past, Gu Yang's goals would not have been so grand.</p><p></p><p>But with the rise of the faction he belonged to, as well as the power and reputation that Gu Qingfeng had displayed, as the current lord of the Gu Family Manor, Gu Yang naturally did not want to fall behind.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention becoming a Great Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, he must break through to the Patriarch realm.</p><p></p><p>With his cultivation breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang immediately came out of seclusion.</p><p></p><p>On the war table in the main hall, nearly half of Guangyang Prefecture had already fallen under his control.</p><p></p><p>The banner of the Gu Family Army had completely crushed the imperial forces and the Divine Martial Army.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the downfall of Pei Jing, the Divine Martial Army was in turmoil, and many of its generals were vying to establish their own power.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, under the iron cavalry of the Gu Family Army led by Gu Yang, these forces attempting to establish their own rule were one by one annihilated, and no one could stop the footsteps of the Gu Family Army.</p><p></p><p>This was only natural.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Gu Family Army now numbered nearly 600,000, and they had the powerful Covert Guards secretly supporting them.</p><p></p><p>Not only Guangyang Prefecture, but even the entire Taishan Prefecture, this force had the qualifications to set its sights on.</p><p></p><p>From the time Gu Yang started his campaign to the present, when he had conquered half of Guangyang Prefecture, it had only been about two months.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the military commanders in the main hall and the leader of the Covert Guards, Gu Yang said in a deep voice, "I want the entire Guangyang Prefecture to have only one voice within a month, and that is the voice of my Gu Family Army. Can you all accomplish this?"</p><p></p><p>"Your subordinates are willing to devote our lives for Your Highness!" the many commanders said in unison.</p><p></p><p>Since they were not from the Gu Family Manor, they naturally did not need to address Gu Yang as the lord.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, Gu Yang waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Mobilize the army, I want to conquer the entire Guangyang Prefecture within a month!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!" </p><p></p><p>The commanders saluted and accepted the order.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In half a day's time, the army was on the move again.</p><p></p><p>This time, Gu Yang divided his forces into three routes, directly attacking the remaining territories of Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Under the onslaught of Gu Yang's iron cavalry and the covert assassination and recruitment of the powerful Covert Guards, the resistance forces of Guangyang Prefecture were greatly weakened. In just twenty days, the imperial army and the Divine Martial Army were completely routed.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Guangyang Prefecture had fallen under Gu Yang's control.</p><p></p><p>With the fall of Guangyang Prefecture, the news spread quickly, and all the prefectures in Taishan Prefecture received the information.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the intelligence reports in their hands, many people were shocked.</p><p></p><p>From the time Gu Yang started his campaign to the complete collapse of Guangyang Prefecture, it had been less than three months.</p><p></p><p>Such momentum...</p><p></p><p>was even stronger than that of Pei Jing back then.</p><p></p><p>After all, Pei Jing's rapid rise to power was due to the support of the Pei family, who were the governors of a prefecture. In comparison, although the Gu Family Manor seemed to have a Great Patriarch as its pillar, that Great Patriarch had not taken much action.</p><p></p><p>The reason Guangyang Prefecture fell so quickly was that, in the eyes of other factions, it was entirely due to Gu Yang's own foundation and methods.</p><p></p><p>This made them feel greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

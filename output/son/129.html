        <h1>Chapter 129</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang suddenly felt a terrifying murderous intent permeating the air, giving him a chilling sensation.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>He understood.</p><p></p><p>This was a symbol of his father's strength advancing once again.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's strength seemed to be constantly improving, and the speed of this improvement could only be described as astonishing.</p><p></p><p>"You're here!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng opened his eyes, and a cold glint of bloodthirstiness seemed to flash, causing Gu Yang's entire body to break out in goosebumps, as if he had seen a terrifying existence.</p><p></p><p>This feeling came quickly and left just as fast, but Gu Yang's back was already drenched in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang took a deep breath, steadying the shock in his heart, and then bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng calmly asked, "Tell me, has something happened?"</p><p></p><p>There was no need.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang would almost never come to the Grinding Hall to disturb him.</p><p></p><p>This was also Gu Qingfeng's instruction.</p><p></p><p>The Grinding Hall was the place where he secluded himself for cultivation, and only a few people like Gu Yang were allowed to enter freely, but even they would not come unless it was necessary.</p><p></p><p>"I report to Father that in the past few days, Pei Jing has led an attack on Guangyang Prefecture, and the imperial court has suffered a great defeat, with now as many as 100,000 elite Shenwu troops directly heading towards the Baishi Road.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of the Shenwu troops is obvious, and in this battle, Father, how do you think we should act?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression remained unchanged as he looked at the other person indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"What is your plan?"</p><p></p><p>"I think that our Gu family manor has been painstakingly cultivated over the years, and if we were to abandon our existing business, it would be equivalent to giving up the efforts of many years."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang did not hesitate at all and directly expressed his own views.</p><p></p><p>"These years, I have used the Baishi Road as the foundation, and have also secretly recruited soldiers. Now I have about 100,000 troops. If we were to fight head-on, we might not necessarily be defeated.</p><p></p><p>The only problem is that Pei Jing has the support of the Tianyang Sword Sect behind him.</p><p></p><p>I heard that the imperial court's great defeat this time was because a powerful expert from the Tianyang Sword Sect intervened!"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at Gu Qingfeng, waiting for his decision.</p><p></p><p>To retreat.</p><p></p><p>He was unwilling to do so.</p><p></p><p>But if they don't retreat, they have to see if there is a chance of victory.</p><p></p><p>If it were just the 100,000 Shenwu troops, Gu Yang would be confident in being able to fight them, after all, the 100,000 troops have been cultivated for some time, with abundant resources and martial arts teachings, they are no ordinary soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Now,</p><p></p><p>These troops only lack the baptism of a real battle to transform into true elites.</p><p></p><p>But the most important problem now is the Tianyang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>If they can withstand the Tianyang Sword Sect, then the 100,000 troops would not be a problem, but if they cannot withstand the Tianyang Sword Sect, then even if they defeat the 100,000 troops, it would be useless.</p><p></p><p>In this world, the strong are still the most respected.</p><p></p><p>If it were ordinary martial artists, they would have difficulty surviving being surrounded by a large army, but for top experts, the difficulty of being surrounded and annihilated by a large army is not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore,</p><p></p><p>As long as the other party is willing, they can completely use the decapitation tactic.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>If there is no top expert stationed here, even a large army would be useless.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>Nothing is absolute.</p><p></p><p>If the top expert is truly determined to fight to the death, then the final result may also be exhaustion and demise.</p><p></p><p>"Tianyang Sword Sect..."</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng heard this name, a cold glint flashed in his eyes, and he then said.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The issue with the Tian Yang Sword Sect is not that big. When the critical moment comes, I will take action myself."</p><p></p><p>Saying this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's palm transformed, and the Demon-Slaying Saber, as if drawn by some force, directly fell into his palm.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng handed the Demon-Slaying Saber to Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>"You should carry this saber with you. If a sect master attacks, it can protect your life!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang received the Demon-Slaying Saber with both hands. He could feel the terrifying power contained within the saber sheath, as if the long saber, once unsheathed, would unleash a shocking scene.</p><p></p><p>Holding the Demon-Slaying Saber,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's inner confidence surged.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Gu Qingfeng's words also solidified his determination.</p><p></p><p>Immediately,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang took his leave.</p><p></p><p>Since he had to fight, he must win this battle. Otherwise, if he were to lose the first battle, the subsequent struggle for supremacy would become a joke.</p><p></p><p>Not long after Gu Yang's departure, someone entered the Whetstone Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Your Highness!"</p><p></p><p>"How is the investigation of the Tian Yang Sword Sect's news going?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the person in front of him, Gu Er, and slowly asked.</p><p></p><p>Although the secret guards had already been entrusted to Gu Yang, Gu Qingfeng still had the authority to command the secret guards. A year ago, he had already instructed the secret guards to secretly investigate the intelligence regarding the Tian Yang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had already torn off the mask with the Tian Yang Sword Sect, so he naturally wanted to know his enemy well. Otherwise, if he were to confront the Tian Yang Sword Sect, he would be caught off guard.</p><p></p><p>Gu Er said, "Your Highness, the Tian Yang Sword Sect has a solid foundation. The sect has thirty-six elders, each of whom is at the Xian Tian realm or the Rong Shen realm of cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"At the same time, the rumor is that the Tian Yang Sect Master broke through the Rong Shen realm barrier long ago, and stepped into the legendary Hua Sheng realm."</p><p></p><p>"However, for the past few hundred years, the Tian Yang Sect Master has been in seclusion and rarely made appearances."</p><p></p><p>"There are some rumors that the reason the Tian Yang Sect Master has not appeared is because the previous life-and-death battles have led to the resurgence of evil forces within his body, so he has been suppressing the revival of the evil forces."</p><p></p><p>"There are also rumors that the Tian Yang Sect Master is in seclusion, trying to break through to realms beyond the Hua Sheng realm. But the specifics are unknown to me."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly at Gu Er's words.</p><p></p><p>The secret guards were able to gather such information, which was already not easy. To uncover the secrets of the Tian Yang Sect Master would not be that simple.</p><p></p><p>The Rong Shen realm and the Hua Sheng realm mentioned by Gu Er were the two cultivation realms of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The Yu Ling realm cultivators were only equivalent to the Lian Zang and ordinary Xian Tian realms.</p><p></p><p>Rong Shen realm cultivators were comparable to the peak of True Intent masters, and the pinnacle could even rival half-step Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>As for the Hua Sheng realm,</p><p></p><p>Even at the initial stage of the Hua Sheng realm, one could be no weaker than a Grand Master of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>According to this information, the Tian Yang Sword Sect conservatively had at least one peak Hua Sheng realm cultivator. As for whether the Tian Yang Sect Master had broken through the Hua Sheng realm and stepped into an even higher realm, the possibility was not that great in Gu Qingfeng's view.</p><p></p><p>Because according to Gu Qingfeng's understanding, the top-tier cultivators of the immortal families and sects in the world were mostly at the Hua Sheng realm.</p><p></p><p>Although the Hua Sheng realm seems to be only equivalent to a Grand Master, in reality, the two are completely incomparable.</p><p></p><p>The simple reason is:</p><p></p><p>Grand Masters have a lifespan of 800 years.</p><p></p><p>Hua Sheng realm cultivators have a lifespan of 3,000 years.</p><p></p><p>This is the difference.</p><p></p><p>A lifespan of 3,000 years.</p><p></p><p>Even if they had to outlive several Grand Masters, it would not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Bluntly speaking, in the face of such a long lifespan, Grand Masters are naturally inferior to cultivators of the same realm.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 129</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang suddenly felt a terrifying murderous intent permeating the air, giving him a chilling sensation.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>He understood.</p><p></p><p>This was a symbol of his father's strength advancing once again.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's strength seemed to be constantly improving, and the speed of this improvement could only be described as astonishing.</p><p></p><p>"You're here!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng opened his eyes, and a cold glint of bloodlust seemed to flash, causing Gu Yang's entire body to break out in goosebumps, as if he had encountered a terrifying existence.</p><p></p><p>This feeling came quickly and left just as fast, but Gu Yang's back was already soaked in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang took a deep breath, steadying the shock in his heart, and then bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng calmly asked, "Tell me, has something happened?"</p><p></p><p>There was no need.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang would almost never come to the Grinding Hall to disturb him.</p><p></p><p>This was also Gu Qingfeng's order.</p><p></p><p>The Grinding Hall was the place where he secluded himself for cultivation, and only a few people like Gu Yang were allowed to enter freely, but they would not come unless it was necessary.</p><p></p><p>"Father, in the past few days, Pei Jing has led an attack on Guangyang Prefecture, and the imperial court has suffered a major defeat. Now, there are 100,000 elite troops directly heading towards the Baishi Road.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of the elite troops is obvious, and in this battle, Father, how do you think we should act?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression remained unchanged as he looked at the other person indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"What is your plan?"</p><p></p><p>"I believe that our Gu family manor, which we have painstakingly built up over the years, should not be abandoned. To do so would be to give up the efforts of many years."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang did not hesitate at all and directly expressed his view.</p><p></p><p>"These years, I have used the Baishi Road as a foundation and have been secretly recruiting soldiers. Now, I have about 100,000 troops. If we were to fight head-on, we might not necessarily be defeated.</p><p></p><p>The only problem is that Pei Jing has the support of the Tianyang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>I heard that the reason for the imperial court's great defeat was that there were powerful experts from the Tianyang Sword Sect intervening!"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at Gu Qingfeng, waiting for his decision.</p><p></p><p>To retreat.</p><p></p><p>He was unwilling to do so.</p><p></p><p>But if they don't retreat, they need to see if there is a chance of victory.</p><p></p><p>If it were just the 100,000 elite troops, Gu Yang would be confident in being able to fight them, after all, the 100,000 troops had been cultivated for some time, with abundant resources and martial arts teachings, they were no ordinary soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Now,</p><p></p><p>These troops only lacked the baptism of war to be transformed into true elites.</p><p></p><p>But the most important issue at hand is the Tianyang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>If they could withstand the Tianyang Sword Sect, then the 100,000 troops would not be a problem. But if they couldn't withstand the Tianyang Sword Sect, then even if they defeated the 100,000 troops, it would be useless.</p><p></p><p>In this world, the strong are still the most respected.</p><p></p><p>If it were ordinary warriors, they would have difficulty surviving being surrounded by a large army, but for top-tier experts, the difficulty of being surrounded and killed by a large army is not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore,</p><p></p><p>As long as the other party is willing, they can completely use the decapitation tactic.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>If there are no top-tier experts stationed, even a large army would be useless.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>Nothing is absolute.</p><p></p><p>If the top-tier experts were to fight to the death without retreating, then the final result would probably be that they perish from exhaustion.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianyang Sword Sect..."</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng heard this name, a cold glint flashed in his eyes, and he then said.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The issue with the Tian Yang Sword Sect is not that big. When the critical moment comes, I will step in myself."</p><p></p><p>Saying this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's palm transformed, and the Zhu Xie Dao (Exorcising Blade) was drawn into his hand as if it was being pulled by some force.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng handed the Zhu Xie Dao to Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>"Carry this blade with you. Even if a sect master attacks, it can protect your life!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang received the Zhu Xie Dao with both hands. He could feel the terrifying power contained within the scabbard, as if the long blade, once unsheathed, would unleash an earth-shattering scene.</p><p></p><p>Holding the Zhu Xie Dao,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's heart was filled with confidence.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Gu Qingfeng's words had also solidified his determination.</p><p></p><p>Immediately,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang took his leave.</p><p></p><p>Since he had to fight, he must win this battle. Otherwise, if he were to lose the first battle, the subsequent struggle for supremacy would become a joke.</p><p></p><p>Not long after Gu Yang's departure, someone entered the Grinding Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Your Highness!"</p><p></p><p>"How is the investigation on the Tian Yang Sword Sect going?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the person in front of him, Gu Er, and slowly asked.</p><p></p><p>Although the secret agents had already been entrusted to Gu Yang, Gu Qingfeng still had the authority to command them. A year ago, he had already instructed the secret agents to secretly gather intelligence on the Tian Yang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had already torn off the mask with the Tian Yang Sword Sect, so he must know his enemy well. Otherwise, if he were to confront the Tian Yang Sword Sect, he would be caught off guard.</p><p></p><p>Gu Er said, "Your Highness, the Tian Yang Sword Sect has a solid foundation. The sect has thirty-six elders, each of whom has reached the Xian Tian (Transcendent) realm or the Rong Shen (Fusion Spirit) realm of cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Additionally, the rumor is that the Tian Yang Sect Master had broken through the Rong Shen realm barrier and stepped into the legendary Hua Sheng (Transformation) realm many thousands of years ago."</p><p></p><p>"However, for the past few hundred years, the Tian Yang Sect Master has been in seclusion and rarely made appearances."</p><p></p><p>"There are some rumors that the reason the Tian Yang Sect Master has not appeared is because the previous life-and-death battles have caused some evil forces to stir within his body, so he has been suppressing the resurgence of these evil forces."</p><p></p><p>"There are also rumors that the Tian Yang Sect Master is in seclusion, attempting to break through to realms beyond the Hua Sheng realm. But the specifics are still unknown to me."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly at Gu Er's words.</p><p></p><p>The secret agents were able to gather such information, which was already not easy. To uncover the true secrets of the Tian Yang Sect Master would not be that simple.</p><p></p><p>The Rong Shen realm and Hua Sheng realm mentioned by Gu Er were the two cultivation realms of Sorcerers.</p><p></p><p>The Ling Gui (Spirit-Controlling) realm Sorcerers were only equivalent to the Lian Zang (Refining Impurities) realm and the ordinary Xian Tian realm.</p><p></p><p>Rong Shen realm Sorcerers were comparable to the peak of True Meaning Sect Masters, and the pinnacle could even rival Half-Step Grand Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>As for the Hua Sheng realm,</p><p></p><p>Even at the initial stage of the Hua Sheng realm, one could be no weaker than a Grand Sect Master of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>According to the information provided, the Tian Yang Sword Sect likely had at least one Hua Sheng realm pinnacle Sorcerer. As for whether the Tian Yang Sect Master had broken through the Hua Sheng realm and stepped into an even higher realm, the possibility seemed rather small in Gu Qingfeng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Because according to Gu Qingfeng's understanding, the most outstanding Sorcerers of the various immortal families and sects were mostly at the Hua Sheng realm.</p><p></p><p>Although the Hua Sheng realm may only be equivalent to a Grand Sect Master, the reality was that the two were completely incomparable.</p><p></p><p>The simple reason was:</p><p></p><p>Grand Sect Masters had a lifespan of 800 years.</p><p></p><p>Hua Sheng realm Sorcerers had a lifespan of 3,000 years.</p><p></p><p>This was the difference.</p><p></p><p>A lifespan of 3,000 years.</p><p></p><p>They could outlive several Grand Sect Masters without any problem.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, in the face of such a long lifespan, Grand Sect Masters were naturally inferior to Sorcerers of the same realm.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

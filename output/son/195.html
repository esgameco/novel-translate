            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was enough to shock the entire Nanyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>It had not been long since Gu Qingfeng left the Blood Mountain Manor, but soon others entered the Blood Mountain Manor.</p><p></p><p>When they saw that the vast Blood Mountain Manor had become a hellish slaughterhouse, everyone was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Mountain Manor is gone!"</p><p></p><p>"An entire manor has been completely massacred, what a ruthless method—"</p><p></p><p>Even those who had already seen the tragic state of the Blood Mountain Manor could not help but feel horrified when they truly entered the Blood Mountain Manor this time.</p><p></p><p>It was originally thought that although some people had died in this Blood Mountain Manor incident, it was not too serious.</p><p></p><p>But now, it seems...</p><p></p><p>The Blood Mountain Manor was not just a matter of a few people dying.</p><p></p><p>The vast Blood Mountain Manor.</p><p></p><p>Had been completely massacred.</p><p></p><p>The hundreds of thousands of manor residents.</p><p></p><p>It was far more than just a few million.</p><p></p><p>Even in these times of endless natural disasters and great upheaval in the world, the death of so many civilians was an earth-shattering event.</p><p></p><p>Especially when someone entered the cursed mountain range and saw the cracked earth and the sword marks that had split the mountains, their pupils suddenly contracted, and the shock on their faces was indescribable in words.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss, a world-shaking battle must have taken place here!"</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful sword intent, this sword intent has probably already surpassed the limits of a Sect Master's sword intent!"</p><p></p><p>"The sword intent of a Great Sect Master, this must be the legendary Great Sect Master sword intent..."</p><p></p><p>Some veteran Sect Master experts, looking at the deep sword marks embedded in the mountain range and the terrifying sword intent, were deeply shocked.</p><p></p><p>Although ordinary Sect Master sword intent was already terrifying, it was nowhere near as horrifying as the one before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>This sword intent seemed indestructible and eternal, and even just looking at it directly caused a mysterious, painful sensation.</p><p></p><p>Some people tried to approach the sword marks, but before they could even get close to the hundred-yard range, they were directly blown away by the terrifying sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Some were even unable to dodge in time and were cut in half by this sword intent.</p><p></p><p>This scene.</p><p></p><p>Caused the other people who wanted to comprehend and observe the sword intent to instinctively stop in their tracks.</p><p></p><p>There was no way.</p><p></p><p>The sword intent was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Even Sect Masters found it difficult to approach.</p><p></p><p>To withstand the pressure of this true intent, one would either have to be a master who had comprehended the Sect Master's true intent, or have strength comparable to a Great Dao Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise.</p><p></p><p>There was no possibility of withstanding this sword intent's attack.</p><p></p><p>"This sword intent is much more domineering than the one in Guangyang Manor, could it be that another peerless expert has appeared in the world?"</p><p></p><p>Some Sect experts had doubtful and fearful expressions, their gazes still filled with terror as they looked at the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>The sword intent in Guangyang Manor was left behind by the one known as the Martial Saint today. Now, the sword intent here was even more terrifying than the one in Guangyang Manor, which was hard not to make people wonder.</p><p></p><p>Like such Martial Dao experts, it was rare for even one to appear in a millennium, and now there seemed to be two experts on par with the Martial Ancestors emerging, which naturally shook all parties.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Soon, some experts discerned the clues and shook their heads slightly: "Although the sword intent here is stronger than the one in Guangyang Manor, if you observe carefully, you can see that they have many similar characteristics.</p><p></p><p>In the opinion of this old man, the expert who left this sword intent is likely to be from the same source as the one in Guangyang Manor!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the other experts also carefully sensed it and soon found that what the other person said was true.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the sword intent here is indeed from the same source as the one in Guangyang Manor!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the expert who left this sword intent is that Martial Saint!"</p><p></p><p>"This sword intent is terrifying, compared to the one in Guangyang Manor, it has clearly reached a higher level, which shows that the strength of that Martial Saint has also improved further!"</p><p></p><p>Some people exclaimed in awe.</p><p></p><p>In such a short time.</p><p></p><p>The other party's cultivation had made another breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Gu Qingfeng's cultivation breakthrough, they were more inclined to believe that Gu Qingfeng had hidden his true strength before, and this sword strike he unleashed now reflected his real level.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise.</p><p></p><p>For his strength to make another breakthrough in such a short time would be quite shocking.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently.</p><p></p><p>Some also discovered the remnants of the cursed aura in the mountain range, as well as the traces of blood sacrifice, which made it easy to deduce the course of events.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>The news that the Blood Mountain Manor had been invaded by a curse, massacring all the manor residents, and that the Martial Saint Gu Qingfeng had single-handedly entered the Blood Mountain Manor to slay the curse, spread like a hurricane throughout the entire Nanyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>—</p><p></p><p>"Father has succeeded!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang, who was leading the experts of the Divine Martial Sect towards the Tian Yang Sword Sect, saw the report from his subordinates and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect Gu Qingfeng to act so quickly, as he had just sent the message, and the other party had already entered the Blood Mountain Manor and completely slain the awakened curse.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>When he heard that all the hundreds of thousands of Blood Mountain Manor residents had been massacred by the curse, Gu Yang's face darkened, and he looked towards the direction of the Tian Yang Sword Sect, a cold gleam appearing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The hundreds of thousands of Blood Mountain Manor residents have all been sacrificed by the Tian Yang Sword Sect, such a sect must be destroyed, for it defies the will of heaven!"</p><p></p><p>"In this battle, I will ensure that not a single one of the Tian Yang Sword Sect's members survives!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was inwardly furious about the actions of the Tian Yang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of thousands of lives.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the Tian Yang Sword Sect's blood sacrifice of the curse, this would not have happened.</p><p></p><p>Such a heaven-defying and people-hating act, Gu Yang would certainly not tolerate.</p><p></p><p>The other experts of the Divine Martial Sect also had expressions of indignation upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"The Tian Yang Sword Sect has already earned a death sentence!"</p><p></p><p>"In this battle, we will annihilate the Tian Yang Sword Sect, to mourn the residents of the Blood Mountain Manor."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Damned souls!" </p><p></p><p>The other members of the Divine Martial Sect were filled with righteous indignation, and even the usually calm Gu Yun had a gloomy expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>To be honest.</p><p></p><p>He was well aware that if the Heaven Yang Sword Sect were to perform a blood sacrifice, it would inevitably result in significant casualties. But Gu Yun never imagined that this incident would lead to the entire population of Blood Mountain Prefecture being wiped out.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun also understood.</p><p></p><p>If the evil entity of Blood Mountain Prefecture could slaughter all the people of a prefecture, then its strength must be terrifying beyond imagination.</p><p></p><p>Even the powerful demonic Buddha of the Nine Bends Dao was only capable of massacring the people of a single Dao, and could not be compared to the evil entity of Blood Mountain Prefecture that had wiped out an entire prefecture.</p><p></p><p>For the evil entity.</p><p></p><p>The more lives it slaughtered, the more terrifying its strength would become.</p><p></p><p>"The evil entity of Blood Mountain Prefecture is capable of massacring millions of people, its strength must have reached a horrifying level. If not for Master Gu's personal intervention, the entire South Yang Prefecture would have been reduced to a sea of blood, just as the Heaven Yang Sword Sect had intended."</p><p></p><p>"To put it more broadly, perhaps the entire Nine Provinces could be engulfed in disaster because of this!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>This was not just idle speculation.</p><p></p><p>The evil entity of Blood Mountain Prefecture was already formidable, and now that it had massacred the people of an entire prefecture, there were few in the South Yang Prefecture who could contend with it. </p><p></p><p>Furthermore, with the current chaos in the world, where various factions were embroiled in bloody conflicts across the Central Plains, how many would have the spare strength to resolve the problem in the South Yang Prefecture?</p><p></p><p>If that were the case.</p><p></p><p>This evil entity would be free to wreak havoc in the South Yang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>At that point.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the evil entity would undoubtedly become even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>By then.</p><p></p><p>Even those immortal sects and noble families, if they wanted to deal with this evil entity, might not necessarily succeed.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's slaying of the evil entity of Blood Mountain Prefecture this time has resolved an immense crisis.</p><p></p><p>"Father has already dealt with the problem of Blood Mountain Prefecture, and now it is our turn to resolve the issue of the Heaven Yang Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression was icy cold as he quickened his pace, heading towards the Heaven Yang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>South Yang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The Fei Residence.</p><p></p><p>The Fei Residence was now in complete chaos, as Gu Yi and others, leading a group of elite Shadowguards, had barged in and were ruthlessly slaughtering.</p><p></p><p>"How dare a mere Shadowguard come to my Fei Residence and run amok, seeking death!" </p><p></p><p>A Fei Family expert roared, but was immediately silenced by a chilling blade light. He hastily drew his sword to block, but was no match for the sheer power of the strike.</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>The sword shattered.</p><p></p><p>The Fei Family expert was cleaved in two, his blood spraying everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"Sixteenth Elder!!"</p><p></p><p>A Fei Family disciple, eyes bulging with rage, watched the fallen Fei Family elder, his expression a mix of fury and terror.</p><p></p><p>The Fei Family had eighteen elders.</p><p></p><p>Even the weakest of them had reached the Refined Impurity Perfection realm. </p><p></p><p>Such powerful experts were formidable existences in the entire South Yang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Yet.</p><p></p><p>Now a Shadowguard expert had struck, slaying the Sixteenth Elder in a single move, causing the others to be gripped by fear.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Elder Fei Lin stepped forward, unleashing a powerful palm strike towards the Shadowguard, his enraged face filled with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you kill my Fei Family elder, prepare to die!"</p><p></p><p>"Primal Patriarch Master..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Er's expression remained indifferent, a trace of disdain flashing in his eyes. He poured his mighty Primal True Qi into the long saber, and the terrifying saber qi, like a bolt of lightning, struck out, seemingly able to cleave the heavens and earth, its aura of slaughter overwhelming. Even Fei Lin was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Although Fei Lin had not yet reached the Patriarch Master Perfection realm after breaking through to the Primal Patriarch Master realm for decades, his cultivation was already at the higher echelons of that realm. </p><p></p><p>While Gu Er was able to slay the Sixteenth Elder with a single stroke, Fei Lin did not consider him a threat.</p><p></p><p>After all, the gap between the Refined Impurity Perfection and the Primal Patriarch Master realms was immense.</p><p></p><p>If the latter were to truly unleash his full strength, he could easily annihilate the former.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>When the two actually clashed, Fei Lin suddenly realized that he had greatly underestimated Gu Er.</p><p></p><p>The latter's strength was far beyond that of a newly ascended Primal Patriarch Master, his Primal True Qi was so overwhelming that it surpassed Fei Lin's accumulated foundation over the decades.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they engaged, Fei Lin was pushed back, struggling to keep up.</p><p></p><p>Moments later.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a sword slicing through the air, a geyser of blood erupted, and Fei Lin's severed head flew off, his expression one of disbelief as he uttered four words with great difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch Master Perfection..."</p><p></p><p>Before the words fully left his lips, Fei Lin's expression was frozen forever.</p><p></p><p>At this point.</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder of the Fei Family was dead.</p><p></p><p>"No, the Second Elder is dead!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the heavens are truly intent on destroying my Fei Family!?"</p><p></p><p>Witnessing Fei Lin being slain by Gu Er in the blink of an eye, the remaining Fei Family members were gripped by terror, and many lost the will to fight, their eyes filled with despair.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a agonizing scream rang out, and the Fei Family members all turned to look.</p><p></p><p>They saw Fei Sheng, who was being surrounded and attacked by Gu Yi and two other Primal Patriarch Masters, suddenly being cleaved in two by a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>The lifeless body fell, staining the ground with blood.</p><p></p><p>This scene.</p><p></p><p>Completely extinguished the last vestiges of fighting spirit in the remaining Fei Family members.

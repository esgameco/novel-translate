        <h1>Chapter 222</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fierce beasts were rampaging.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, many villages had been reduced to ruins, with bloodied corpses strewn everywhere.</p><p></p><p>At that time, when General Shi led the Tiangong Army to the scene, they happened to witness a ferocious beast, resembling a giant ape, wreaking havoc. With its massive palm-like hand, it grabbed a person and, to the victim's horrified gaze, its hideous bloody maw opened wide and bit down, causing blood to spray everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, there were numerous bodies lying on the ground - some were ordinary civilians, while others were from the imperial army. When the others attacked this beast, their strikes couldn't even damage its fur, let alone injure it.</p><p></p><p>Fear and despair spread among the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Just then, an angry roar rang out:</p><p></p><p>"Vile beast, how dare you harm my divine and mighty people!"</p><p></p><p>Before the words had fully faded, a terrifying aura of blood energy transformed into a thunderous blade qi that came crashing down upon the ape-like beast. The beast let out a furious roar and struck back with a powerful punch.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, its fur was shattered, and flesh and blood flew everywhere. The beast's right hand was drenched in blood, with its white bones visible, and its hideous face became distorted as it let out a pained howl.</p><p></p><p>The one who had attacked was none other than General Shi. Seeing that the beast could withstand his blade, Shi's gaze remained cold and ruthless. His crescent moon blade unleashed a flurry of strikes, and the pinnacle of his true martial intent erupted, exerting a powerful pressure that finally instilled fear in the beast.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, the beast turned and tried to flee.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a flash of cold light appeared.</p><p></p><p>The beast's body suddenly stiffened, and then its massive head tumbled from its neck, spraying blood high into the air as its gigantic corpse crashed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>This sight left the onlookers stunned, but then their faces broke into expressions of wild joy.</p><p></p><p>"It's dead! The fierce beast is finally dead!"</p><p>"This great hero's strength is incredible, slaying such a monster with just two strikes!"</p><p></p><p>All eyes were filled with awe as they looked upon General Shi.</p><p></p><p>The weak revere the strong - this is an eternal truth.</p><p></p><p>However, Shi's expression did not show much joy. As he gazed upon the ape-like beast's corpse, his brow was furrowed.</p><p></p><p>From their earlier clash, Shi had realized that this was a beast that could rival the greatest of martial masters. He had been able to slay it so easily only because he had struck first, instilling fear in the beast. If they had engaged in a true frontal confrontation, Shi would have been able to defeat it, but it would not have been so effortless.</p><p></p><p>It was only half a day later that the Tiangong Army finally arrived.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the Tiangong Army's speed would not be slow, but Shi had received news of the beast first and thus arrived ahead of them.</p><p></p><p>Over the past half year, the problem of fierce beasts in the Nine Provinces had become increasingly severe. It was as if something in the Ancient Beast Mountains was driving them all out.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, Lord Gu Yang had no choice but to issue bounties, mobilizing not only the imperial forces but also various martial artists from the jianghu to jointly suppress the rampaging beasts.</p><p></p><p>However, the Ancient Beast Mountains were simply too vast, with too many fierce beasts dwelling within. Even with the full might of the imperial forces, they could only temporarily alleviate the pressure.</p><p></p><p>Some who hunted the beasts discovered that their blood and flesh contained immense energy that could strengthen one's own qi and blood, thus improving their cultivation. This led to more and more martial artists from the jianghu venturing to the borders of the Nine Provinces to hunt the fierce beasts.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, under Lord Gu Yang's guidance, the Shenwu Academy led by Yan Yun had been gradually established in various parts of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>This news shocked the jianghu world, as the imperial court had traditionally suppressed the martial arts sects, but now the Shengu Dynasty was openly promoting the cultivation of martial arts, emulating the actions of the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>On a certain day, in the Gu Family Manor, an ancient and powerful sword intent suddenly surged into the heavens, its presence felt for miles around. Any cultivators who sensed this intent were struck with awe and terror, for even the greatest of martial masters were like ants before such a formidable aura.</p><p></p><p>This sword intent persisted for several days before finally dissipating.</p><p></p><p>The news of this event shook the entire world, but Gu Qingfeng paid it no heed. His attention was now focused on his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant Gu Yang has made a breakthrough in his cultivation and his strength has increased slightly."</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant Gu Yang, angered by the havoc wreaked by the fierce beasts, has dispatched imperial forces to suppress the unrest."</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant Gu Yang has established the Shenwu Academy across the Nine Provinces, promoting martial arts, winning the hearts of the people, and gaining great renown."</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant Gu Yang has had a spiritual awakening and has broken through to the initial stage of the Grand Master realm."</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 500 Cultivation Points, 100 True Essence Elixirs, 100 Divine Blood Elixirs, the complete 'Purple Extreme Dao Classics' Profound Technique, and 4 Divine Soldier Guardians."</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant Gu Shengnan has broken through to the later stage of the Bone Refining Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 30 Cultivation Points."</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant Gu Shengnan has gained insights into the Qinglian Sword Classics, greatly increasing his strength."</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant Gu Xuan has been guided by a Divine Soldier Realm cultivator, improving his abilities."</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant Gu Xuan has gained deeper insights into the True Essence of the Heavenly Saber while cultivating in the Ancient Beast Mountains."</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant Gu Xuan has broken through to the middle stage of the Marrow Cleansing Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 50 Cultivation Points."</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant Gu Xiu has been guided by a Grand Master, breaking through to the later stage of the Bone Refining Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 30 Cultivation Points."</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant Gu Shengjing has broken through to the later stage of the Blood Refining Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 20 Cultivation Points."</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant Gu Shengan has broken through to the later stage of the Blood Refining Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 20 Cultivation Points."</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant Gu Shengjing has reached the peak of the Blood Refining Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 20 Cultivation Points."</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant Gu Shengan has reached the peak of the Blood Refining Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 20 Cultivation Points."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the numerous messages, gaining an understanding of the events that had transpired during his seclusion. He was not surprised that his son Gu Yang had broken through to the Grand Master realm, as the young man possessed the auspicious blessings of the dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Over the past year, Gu Qingfeng had turned 52 years old, while Gu Yang was now 31. Gu Qingfeng was not shocked by Gu Yang's rapid advancement, as the young man had many fortuitous encounters.</p><p></p><p>As for Gu Qingfeng's other descendants, they had all made varying degrees of progress in their cultivations as well. However, what truly concerned Gu Qingfeng was the impact of Gu Yang's breakthrough to the Grand Master realm.</p><p></p><p>The rewards Gu Qingfeng received this time, including the complete Profound Technique and the Divine Soldier Guardians, were rare and valuable. This indicated that Gu Yang's accomplishments had reached a significant level.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng summoned the four Divine Soldier Guardians and bestowed them with the Gu Family's elder titles, passing on the Divine Yang Classics to them as well. With their cultivation at the peak of the Divine Soldier Realm, they had the potential to break through to the Dao Palace Realm in the future.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also provided them with identity tokens imbued with his own true essence, to prevent any forgeries. This was inspired by the information he had obtained from Mu Rongxiu's legacy.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng could sense that the events unfolding in the world were just the beginning of greater changes to come.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was just a superficial understanding at best.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>Murong Xiu naturally would not leave behind the method of refining.</p><p></p><p>Without such a method, Gu Qingfeng could only settle for the next best thing, leaving a trace of his true intent on the identity token, although not as good as the identity tokens of the major forces in the Huagu Realm, but it was still not bad.</p><p></p><p>Although there were still flaws in it, at least there was a means of identification.</p><p></p><p>After letting the four people leave, Gu Qingfeng took out the Purple Extreme Dao Canon.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Gu Qingfeng opened the cultivation method, it turned into a stream of light and retreated into his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>A large number of memories surged forth.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's qi and blood boiled, like a vast and terrifying flood rushing forth, with a mighty momentum.</p><p></p><p>But despite this, Gu Qingfeng's cultivation did not make any breakthroughs, but his entire qi and blood had become more refined.</p><p></p><p>After a long time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng exhaled a mouthful of turbid air, with a faint smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"A top-tier divine ability realm cultivation method, although my cultivation has not broken through, my strength has indeed increased significantly!"</p><p></p><p>This was another advantage of his innate divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people, after their qi and blood are refined to a certain degree, want to further refine and condense them, and every step is as difficult as ascending to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not need to worry about these problems.</p><p></p><p>As long as the improvement points are sufficient, he can refine his qi and blood to a truly extreme degree.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Purple Extreme Dao Canon has appeared, it has saved Gu Qingfeng a lot of painstaking effort in cultivating the foundation, and it has also indirectly compensated for the deficiencies of the Divine Yang Classic in the divine ability realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, although the Divine Yang Classic is powerful, it is impossible to refine every realm to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Just the perfect body refinement alone has already made the Divine Yang Classic extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>To refine every step, from the Grandmaster, Great Grandmaster, to the Divine Ability Realm and the Dao Palace Realm, is simply impossible.</p><p></p><p>Similarly.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Divine Yang Classic could achieve this, it would be difficult for cultivators to achieve great success.</p><p></p><p>After all, the more extreme the martial arts, the more difficult they are to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>The final step.</p><p></p><p>Is the most difficult to break through.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Purple Extreme Dao Canon has appeared, it has saved Gu Qingfeng a lot of painstaking effort, and it has also added another divine ability realm peak cultivation method to the Gu Family Village.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked inward at his Dao Palace divine soul.</p><p></p><p>The Desolate Ancient Heaven Saber had broken through.</p><p></p><p>The five-inch divine soul had directly grown to a nine-inch divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Nine is the ultimate number.</p><p></p><p>The moment the divine soul stepped into the nine-inch realm, Gu Qingfeng sensed a bottleneck, as if there was an invisible force suppressing and restricting him, preventing the divine soul from breaking through further.</p><p></p><p>When this feeling appeared, Gu Qingfeng already knew that it was time for him to break through again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's thoughts moved, and with the consumption of 500 improvement points, the Divine Yang Classic instantly broke through from the first layer of the Dao Palace Realm to the second layer.</p><p></p><p>With the appearance of a large amount of memories, Gu Qingfeng's aura also suddenly surged, and the suppressive power within his divine soul also abruptly disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Growth!</p><p></p><p>The divine soul began to grow frantically. Ten inches! Eleven inches! Twelve inches! ...</p><p></p><p>In a moment.</p><p></p><p>The divine soul had stepped into the eighteen-inch realm.</p><p></p><p>But after the divine soul broke through to the eighteen-inch realm, the disappeared bottleneck appeared again.</p><p></p><p>Immediately.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng continued to break through.</p><p></p><p>Dao Palace Realm Third Layer!</p><p></p><p>Dao Palace Realm Fourth Layer!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng used up all his improvement points in one breath, directly raising the Divine Yang Classic to the fourth layer of the Dao Palace Realm, and his own cultivation also rose to the Dao Palace Realm Fourth Layer.</p><p></p><p>The powerful forces that had been dormant in his physical body were revived, which were many times stronger than when he was at the Dao Palace Realm First Layer.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>Due to the rapid rise in realm, his divine soul power had also surged.</p><p></p><p>Now, even if he were to face a Divine Ability Realm Ninth Layer expert, Gu Qingfeng could directly kill them with his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng  Age: 52/6000  Realm: Dao Palace Realm Fourth Layer</p><p>Martial Arts: Heaven Vein True Classic (Second Layer), Heaven Saber (Perfected), Great Desolate Fist Classic (Perfected), Divine Yang Classic (Dao Palace Realm Fourth Layer), Desolate Ancient Heaven Saber (Initiate), Purple Extreme Dao Canon (Perfected)</p><p>Improvement Points: 534...</p><p></p><p>"Dao Palace Realm Fourth Layer!"</p><p></p><p>"Desolate Ancient Heaven Saber Initiate!"</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Gu Qingfeng had a truly clear understanding of the inheritance of the Sages.</p><p></p><p>The Desolate Ancient Heaven Saber was just an initiate, yet it had caused his divine soul power to surge, allowing his Dao Palace divine soul to grow, enabling him to break through to the Dao Palace Realm Fourth Layer in one breath.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng looked inward at the Dao Palace in his dantian, his divine soul had already grown to thirty-two inches.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>This had not yet reached the limit of the Dao Palace Realm Fourth Layer.</p><p></p><p>Based on the nine-inch limit per realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng suspected that only when his divine soul broke through to thirty-six inches would he truly be able to touch the limit of the Dao Palace Realm Fourth Layer.</p><p></p><p>"According to the information left behind by Murong Xiu, the limit that each layer of the Dao Palace Realm can reach represents the talent and potential of the cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"For ordinary Dao Palace Realm cultivators, reaching two inches of divine soul per realm is already considered excellent, and those who can enter the three-inch realm are considered geniuses."</p><p></p><p>"If the divine soul can reach five inches or more, they belong to the true prodigy category."</p><p></p><p>"And my limit for each realm is a nine-inch divine soul, such an anomaly must be closely related to the Ancient Immortal Body!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was very clear that his natural talent and constitution could only be considered average, but now he could achieve this, the only possible reason was the Ancient Immortal Body.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of such an immortal body had allowed his aptitude to truly reach the top tier.</p><p></p><p>"The oldest immortal body in the heavens and earth!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>He found that he had never been able to fully uncover the true profundity of the Ancient Immortal Body, but even so, relying on the advantages of the Ancient Immortal Body, his own foundation was unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>Now.</p><p></p><p>A thirty-two-inch divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Even many peak Dao Palace Realm experts might not necessarily possess.</p><p></p><p>To be honest.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng himself was not even sure what level of strength he was at now.</p><p></p><p>The surging realms.</p><p></p><p>Only gave Gu Qingfeng a feeling.</p><p></p><p>That is, he is now terrifyingly strong.</p><p></p><p>Immediately.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's divine sense moved, and the Exorcism Saber directly fell into his hand.</p><p></p><p>The long saber was unsheathed.</p><p></p><p>Slicing his palm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng used his own fresh blood to imbue the saber sheath, and then slowly seeped into the saber blade.</p><p></p><p>With his current Dao Palace Realm Fourth Layer cultivation, every drop of blood contained boundless divine might, and now this blood infusing into the Exorcism Saber caused the divine weapon to tremble slightly, as if an earth-shattering saber intent was emanating from it, but it did not exceed the scope of the Grinding Hall.</p><p></p><p>Sword Nurturing Technique! Gu Qingfeng had cultivated this secret art for decades.</p><p></p><p>To him.</p><p></p><p>The Exorcism Saber was no longer a simple weapon, but a partner of his own.</p><p></p><p>After years of being nourished by his own fresh blood, Gu Qingfeng felt that his connection with the Exorcism Saber had deepened further, and this divine saber also seemed to have something that was about to be born within it.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was not unfamiliar to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>On that jujube tree in the Divine Martial Sect before, Gu Qingfeng had the same feeling.</p><p></p><p>The difference is.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the spirituality of the jujube tree, the spirituality of the Exorcism Saber is obviously much weaker, and to truly reach the level of the jujube tree, it still needs time to be nurtured.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>What Gu Qingfeng lacks the most now is time.</p><p></p><p>To him.</p><p></p><p>The six thousand years of lifespan in the Dao Palace Realm is already quite long, and he is only fifty-two years old so far.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the six thousand years of lifespan, it is not even one percent.</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng emerged from seclusion.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he came out, Gu Peng was the first to arrive.</p><p></p><p>"Your subordinate greets the lord, congratulations on the lord's great progress in cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, during the time I was in seclusion, was there anything that happened?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly, and when he looked at the person in front of him, his divine sense could easily see through the entire person.</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood of the peak Great Grandmaster was robust, but there was not much difference from a year ago. To break through to the Divine Ability Realm, he needed to further refine his qi and blood and give birth to various divine abilities, only then could he truly break through the Great Grandmaster bottleneck and step into a higher realm.</p><p></p><p>But obviously.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng was still far from breaking through to the Divine Ability Realm.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, he felt as if all his secrets were exposed, his body instinctively trembling, but then he quickly recovered.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Gu Qingfeng's question, Gu Peng did not dare to hesitate and respectfully said.</p><p></p><p>"During the lord's seclusion, His Majesty has established Divine Martial Academies in various parts of the Nine States, and there is also an academy established in Baishi City, but due to the lack of teachers, he has ordered people to come to the Gu Family Village to have some of the disciples from the village go to the Divine Martial Academies in Baishi Road and other places to serve as teachers."</p><p></p><p>"Mm..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's goal of conquering the world, he naturally understood, establishing the Immortal Court Kingdom was just the beginning, to further advance to a dynasty or even an empire, he needed to enhance the overall aura of the kingdom.</p><p></p><p>And the simplest way to enhance the aura of the kingdom is to strengthen the overall power of the kingdom.</p><p></p><p>This overall power not only refers to the internal power of the court, but also the power of the entire world.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>Establishing Divine Martial Academies and teaching martial arts to the world is the simplest method.</p><p></p><p>But the Nine States are so vast, if many academies were to be established, the court would have difficulty providing enough manpower, so it is only natural to reach out to the various sects in the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>As the largest jianghu force now, and the foundation behind the Divine Martial Kingdom, Gu Yang's request to the Gu Family Village is very reasonable.</p><p></p><p>These matters.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was not interested in delving too deeply into.</p><p></p><p>When he originally established the Gu Family Village, he only wanted to provide a foundation for his descendants to live and thrive.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng also handed a jade box to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"In addition, this is something His Majesty ordered to be brought to the lord half a year ago, but the lord has been in seclusion, so I did not dare to disturb you!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Qingfeng's divine sense moved, and the jade box directly detached from Gu Peng's hand and fell into his own hand.</p><p></p><p>This jade box was completely sealed, without any keyhole, but this was not a difficult task for Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>He simply squeezed it, and easily broke open the jade box, revealing a jade slip inside, and next to the jade slip was a letter, with a few large words written on the cover.</p><p></p><p>Father, please open!</p><p></p><p>From the handwriting, Gu Qingfeng could tell at a glance that this was Gu Yang's writing.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, Gu Peng watched as the Great Grandmaster, who would be difficult for even him to truly shake, easily crushed the mysterious jade box in Gu Qingfeng's hand as if it were made of paper, and his expression could not help but have even more shock and awe.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 201</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>"If it were not for the fact that the Taixuan Dynasty's mandate of heaven has already been exhausted, perhaps I would have let you take that final step!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuanji's gaze was cold, looking at Ji Shendao's eyes as if looking at a dead person.</p><p></p><p>What does a Grand Master of True Meaning matter! </p><p></p><p>As an immortal clan, the Li family of Huangzhou, with Li Xuanji as its patriarch, had strength that was truly extraordinary. </p><p></p><p>Even when facing a Grand Master of True Meaning, he was not the least bit afraid.</p><p></p><p>"The Taixuan Dynasty has no grievances with the Li family of Huangzhou, and since the imperial house of the Ji family has ruled the world, they have taken good care of Huangzhou as well.</p><p></p><p>The Li family patriarch is now taking action, could it be that he truly wants an irreconcilable feud with our Taixuan Dynasty?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shendao tightly gripped the divine saber in his hand, his gaze like lightning looking at Li Xuanji. </p><p></p><p>He did not want to fight Li Xuanji, not because he feared the other, but because of the current situation of the Taixuan Dynasty - it would be best to have one less enemy.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ji Shendao also understood that since Li Xuanji had appeared, the possibility of the Li family of Huangzhou withdrawing was not great.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough.</p><p></p><p>As Ji Shendao's words fell, Li Xuanji said indifferently, "The great trends of the world have their own destiny, the Taixuan Dynasty's rule over the three thousand realms for three thousand years has reached its limit, why do you insist on going against heaven?</p><p></p><p>If you were to retreat now, perhaps you could preserve some of the Ji family imperial bloodline!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid the Li family patriarch does not believe this either." Ji Shendao sneered, his words making Li Xuanji fall silent.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the other's silence, Ji Shendao's gaze was filled with murderous intent, the aura of a Grand Master of True Meaning already quietly permeating the void.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean by 'great trends' and 'going against heaven'? Plainly speaking, it's a matter of who has the stronger fist. Our Ji family imperial house has ruled the three thousand realms for three thousand years, and we will not let you dictate to us.</p><p></p><p>If you want to destroy the foundation of our Taixuan Dynasty, let's see if you have what it takes!"</p><p></p><p>With these words, Ji Shendao immediately attacked.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The slight pain in Gu Qingfeng's mind soon subsided.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, Gu Qingfeng took a look at his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng</p><p>Age: 44/3000</p><p>Realm: Extreme Dao Grandmaster Middle Stage</p><p></p><p>Martial Arts:</p><p>- Heaven Thunder Sword Technique (Beginner)</p><p>- Prajna Sutra (13th Layer Perfected, Prajna True Body 12th Level)</p><p>- Heavenly Vein Sutra (2nd Layer)</p><p>- Longevity Technique (Perfected, Longevity 5th Level)</p><p>- Pure Yang True Body (Minor Success, Flesh Body Pure Yang 2nd Level)</p><p>- Heavenly Saber (Perfected, Heavenly Saber True Intent 12th Level)</p><p>Upgrade Points: 41</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Saber True Intent at the 12th Level!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled slightly. This comprehension had allowed his Heavenly Saber True Intent to advance further, reaching the 12th Level.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Saber technique was a post-Grandmaster level martial art. As his saber intent grew stronger, comprehending the Inextinguishable Saber Intent within the severed finger became much easier.</p><p></p><p>However, over time, Gu Qingfeng noticed that the Inextinguishable Saber Intent in the severed finger had weakened considerably. If he continued to comprehend it, the Inextinguishable Saber Intent would eventually dissipate completely. But it would still take a considerable amount of time before it was completely gone.</p><p></p><p>This was a problem that Gu Qingfeng was not too concerned about.</p><p></p><p>In his leisure time, Gu Qingfeng looked at the information panel again.</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has divided his forces of 1.6 million troops to attack the Danyang and Chiang Jiang prefectures!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has obtained the secret method of the Divine Martial Sect, increasing the probability of birthing offspring!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has received guidance from a Grandmaster, slightly advancing his cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has obtained the inheritance of a mysterious Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has received guidance from a Grandmaster, slightly advancing his cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' and his mighty army are unstoppable, gaining great fame!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by Sect Master realm cultivators *3!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain 6 Refining Impurity realm cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has received guidance from a Grandmaster, slightly advancing his cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Gu Yang had divided his 1.6 million troops to attack the two prefectures, Gu Qingfeng was not too surprised. At this point, if he were in Gu Yang's shoes, he would also seize this opportunity to conquer the two prefectures and completely control the entire Qingyun State.</p><p></p><p>However, when he saw the mention of the Divine Martial Sect's secret method to increase the probability of birthing offspring, Gu Qingfeng was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Martial Sect actually has a secret method to improve the chances of birthing offspring?"</p><p></p><p>He did not expect the Divine Martial Sect to have such a thing. But then he thought about it and felt at ease. The Divine Martial Sect's inheritance spanned millennia, so it was not too surprising that they had some mysterious secret methods.</p><p></p><p>After that, the rest of the information was rather trivial. Ever since the Iron Sword Sect submitted to the Guangyang Army, Gu Yang had gone from receiving guidance from Ancient Cloud to receiving guidance from a true Grandmaster. This was only natural, as Ancient Cloud was at most a half-step Grandmaster, and could not be compared to a true Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Gu Qingfeng could see the profound foundation of the Sword Dao cultivators. Now that they had broken through to the Grandmaster realm, they were far beyond ordinary Grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>With this rate of progress, Gu Qingfeng believed that Gu Yang would break through to the Refining Bone Perfected realm in no time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng then summoned a hidden guard and instructed him to inquire with Ancient Cloud about the Divine Martial Sect's secret method, to see if it could be of use to the Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>The next day, news came from the Central State before any news from the Southern Yang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall, a hidden guard respectfully reported: "Your Lordship, news has come from the Central State. Patriarch Li Xuanji of the Desolate State has joined forces with other powerful cultivators to attack the Imperial Capital, aiming to slay the only True Intent Grandmaster of the Jia Clan, Jia Shendao.</p><p></p><p>This has enraged the Jia Clan's Imperial House, and several Grandmasters have taken action. At a critical moment, Jia Shendao used a secret technique, sacrificing his own body to slay Li Xuanji, shocking all parties. However, the latest news indicates that although Jia Shendao has slain Li Xuanji, he has suffered grave injuries and is now on the verge of death!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's heart trembled slightly upon hearing the guard's report. Although he had some guesses, the actual events still caught him by surprise.</p>

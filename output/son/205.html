        <h1>Chapter 205</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Thanks to Gu Qingfeng's guidance, the other party gained a lot.</p><p></p><p>Not long after the swordsman left, the Sect Master of the Divine Martial Sect, Gu Yun, also came to visit.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of the other party's visit was also very simple.</p><p></p><p>Just like the swordsman.</p><p></p><p>The other party also had some problems in the martial dao and wanted to ask for advice.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yun was clear that the swordsman was able to break through the realm of the Grand Martial Sect Master because he had received guidance from Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Now Gu Yun was at the half-step Grand Sect Master realm, and he had been stagnating at this realm for many years, so he naturally hoped to make further progress.</p><p></p><p>So, with Gu Qingfeng's consent, Gu Yun expressed all the doubts he had accumulated in his martial dao practice over the years.</p><p></p><p>In response, Gu Qingfeng provided answers.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Qingfeng's eyes, these martial dao problems were not big issues at all.</p><p></p><p>Leaving aside the cultivation realm, in terms of martial dao knowledge alone, Gu Qingfeng was far superior to Gu Yun.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had cultivated various martial arts and created the Longevity Sutra involving perfect martial dao, which could be considered a true martial dao master.</p><p></p><p>This master referred not to his strength, but to his true understanding.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it was easy for Gu Qingfeng to guide Gu Yun and resolve his doubts.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, Gu Yun emerged from his contemplation, his eyes filled with amazement and admiration towards Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Shifu's insights in the martial dao are truly beyond my reach!"</p><p></p><p>Many of his previous doubts were resolved, allowing Gu Yun to vaguely see the path ahead for the Grand Martial Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Although this guidance was not enough to truly break through the Grand Martial Sect Master realm for Gu Yun, it at least increased his chances of breakthrough by one-tenth.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that a one-tenth probability was already not low. For normal sect masters to break through to the Grand Sect Master realm, even if there were a hundred half-step Grand Sect Masters, it was unlikely that one would take that step.</p><p></p><p>So, an additional one-tenth probability was a great opportunity for Gu Yun.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng stayed in the manor for a few more days, personally using his own vital energy to cleanse the root bones of Gu Shengxing and Gu Shengan, and then left this place and returned to the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Possibility of Breaking Through Boundaries.</p><p></p><p>It can be said.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao Domain is far more powerful than the Heavenly Dao True Essence, by more than just one level.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had a thought.</p><p></p><p>Quickly.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao Domain unfolded.</p><p></p><p>The vast Gu Family Manor was completely covered by the power of the domain.</p><p></p><p>This.</p><p></p><p>Is the first-level Heavenly Dao Domain, the true range it can cover.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had a premonition that if he wished, with just a single thought, he could completely annihilate all the people within the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Gu Family Manor instinctively felt a emotion called fear, as if they were being watched by a terrifying existence, but no matter how they searched, they could not find anything wrong.</p><p></p><p>Even Gu Peng and other Grandmaster-level martial artists could not detect any issues.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>The domain dissipated.</p><p></p><p>That feeling also dispersed.</p><p></p><p>"The True Essence Domain is far more powerful than ordinary True Essence, to the point that with my current Heavenly Dao Domain, even if I were to face an ordinary Martial Dao Grand Master, I wouldn't even need to personally act to completely annihilate them!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled slightly, very satisfied with his current Heavenly Dao Domain.</p><p></p><p>This powerful technique is the strongest he possesses, aside from the Heavenly脉True Classics.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly脉True Classics can amplify one's strength.</p><p>The Heavenly Dao Domain can subdue and kill any enemy.</p><p></p><p>Wielding these two supreme skills together, Gu Qingfeng doubted whether even Transcendent Realm martial artists could withstand a single strike from him.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at his attribute panel, then began to cultivate other martial arts.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Fifty Upgrade Points! Refining Blood True Classics advanced to the First Layer! Fifty Upgrade Points! Refining Blood True Classics advanced to the Second Layer! Fifty Upgrade Points! Refining Blood True Classics advanced to the Third Layer! ...</p><p></p><p>In just a short moment.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng directly advanced the Refining Blood True Classics from the beginner level all the way to the Fourth Layer.</p><p></p><p>Fourth Layer Refining Blood True Classics.</p><p></p><p>Equivalent to the peak of the Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's qi and blood suddenly became much more robust, but even so, he still had not broken through to the Extreme Dao Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Refining Blood True Classics (Fourth Layer, Divine Blood Level 4)! ...</p><p></p><p>"Fourth Layer Refining Blood True Classics!"</p><p></p><p>"Divine Blood Level 4!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng felt the changes brought about by the breakthrough of the Refining Blood True Classics, he could sense that his refined blood had undergone some subtle transformations.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>These transformations.</p><p></p><p>Were still far from achieving the "Dripping Blood Rebirth" mentioned in the Refining Blood True Classics.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>The foundation of a martial artist is their qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>Now that his qi and blood had undergone a transformation, it naturally led to an increase in Gu Qingfeng's strength.</p><p></p><p>It can be said.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the Grandmaster peak realm.</p><p></p><p>The effects brought by the Refining Blood True Classics are far superior to the Pure Yang True Body.</p><p></p><p>It can be seen.</p><p></p><p>The Refining Blood True Classics is truly a Grand Master-level cultivation method, even at the Grandmaster realm, it can overwhelm other Grandmaster martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"If the Refining Blood True Classics can make a further breakthrough, reaching the Fifth Layer and above the Grand Master realm, then I should have the opportunity to break through to the Extreme Dao Grandmaster realm!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was only a step away from the Extreme Dao Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>Crossing this gap is not difficult, but neither is it as simple as one might imagine.</p><p></p><p>But the Fifth Layer of the Refining Blood True Classics involves the Grand Master realm, and the resulting enhancement to his own breakthrough, in Gu Qingfeng's view, should not pose much of a problem.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Breakthrough in True Essence.</p><p>Increase in Strength.</p><p></p><p>In the following time, Gu Qingfeng was in seclusion, quietly cultivating the Refining Blood True Classics.</p><p></p><p>The Unextinguished Dao of the Heavenly Dao in his severed finger had already been exhausted, and after his True Essence had transformed into the Heavenly Dao Domain, further advancement was not something that could be achieved overnight.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng spent most of his time cultivating the Refining Blood True Classics.</p><p></p><p>The remaining small portion of time was spent guiding Gu Xuan and the others in their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Among them.</p><p></p><p>Gu Shengnan had also reached the age of six.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng formally imparted martial arts to her.</p><p></p><p>In the inner courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Gu Shengnan sat with her chin resting on her hands, her delicate little face filled with a serious expression, her eyes lively and full of curiosity. Occasionally, she would tilt her head, revealing a touch of mischievousness and cleverness.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng suddenly reached out and tapped her forehead, speaking in a serious tone.</p><p></p><p>"Have you remembered clearly the things I just said about cultivating the Longevity Sutra?"</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, I remember clearly."</p><p></p><p>Gu Shengnan's childish face scrunched up, and she dared not be distracted again.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at her expression and shook his head slightly. "Since you remember, then repeat what I just explained about the Longevity Sutra."</p><p></p><p>"Okay..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Shengnan's clear voice responded, and she then recited the Longevity Sutra that Gu Qingfeng had just explained, without missing a single word.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the recitation, Gu Shengnan looked at Gu Qingfeng with a touch of pride.</p><p></p><p>"How is it? I've remembered it, haven't I?"</p><p></p><p>"Your memory is indeed impressive."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng rarely praised her, and then he continued to explain the other aspects of the Longevity Sutra, followed by personally demonstrating and guiding Gu Shengnan in the cultivation, and then having her repeat it again.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Shengnan was still young and this was her first time cultivating martial arts, as long as she saw it once, she could remember everything Gu Qingfeng had taught.</p><p></p><p>Because of this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng became increasingly satisfied with this granddaughter of his.</p><p></p><p>Gu Shengnan was born with the Grandmaster's innate true qi cleansing her foundation, and she was often immersed in various medicinal baths. Even before truly engaging in martial arts, she had already entered the Refined Skin Realm.</p><p></p><p>It is clear that her natural talent in martial arts is truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>And now,</p><p></p><p>In terms of comprehension, Gu Shengnan is also performing outstandingly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was very satisfied with this.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>In the following, he taught Gu Shengnan with even greater care.</p><p></p><p>Similarly,</p><p></p><p>Gu Shengnan's performance did not disappoint Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>In just three days,</p><p></p><p>Gu Shengnan had mastered the Refined Skin Realm of the Longevity Sutra, and in ten days, she had already reached small accomplishment.</p><p></p><p>In two time periods,</p><p></p><p>Gu Shengnan had cultivated the Refined Skin Realm of the Longevity Sutra to perfection, and her cultivation had also broken through to the Refined Skin Realm Perfection.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that.</p><p></p><p>The Longevity Sutra is different from other martial arts.</p><p></p><p>This kind of martial art that forges a perfect foundation is much more difficult to cultivate than ordinary martial arts of the same realm.</p><p></p><p>Even though Gu Shengnan had been receiving the cleansing of innate true qi for a long time, allowing her to enter the Refined Skin Realm before even engaging in martial arts, the fact that she could cultivate the Longevity Sutra to the level of her own realm in just two months, and even further breakthrough to the Refined Skin Realm Perfection, is truly astonishing.</p><p></p><p>As for the others, Gu Qingfeng did not make any comparisons.</p><p></p><p>But if compared to the members of the Gu Family, be it Gu Yang, Gu Xuan, Gu Xiu, or the others, they are all far inferior to Gu Shengnan.</p><p></p><p>Witnessing the talent of his own granddaughter, Gu Qingfeng's mood was greatly improved.</p><p></p><p>For this reason,</p><p></p><p>The blood qi pills he had previously kept for himself, Gu Qingfeng gave to Gu Shengnan to further solidify her foundation.</p><p></p><p>And in the fourth month of Gu Shengnan's encounter with martial arts,</p><p></p><p>She had successfully entered the Refined Blood Realm of the Longevity Sutra, and her cultivation had directly broken through to the Refined Blood Realm Initiation.</p><p></p><p>This news caused a stir throughout the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>Many outer disciples and middle-level members of the Gu Family Manor knew that the Gu Family Manor had produced a peerless prodigy, only six years old, who had achieved the Refined Blood Realm Initiation in just four months of engaging in martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p></p><p>The Outer Hall Master, the current First Heavenly Grandmaster Gu Peng, was also stunned when he heard this news.</p><p></p><p>"A Refined Blood Realm before the age of seven, it seems I have truly lived a dog's life all these decades!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng chuckled bitterly.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he had wasted decades in the martial dao, unable to break through to the Refined Blood Realm, and if it were not for the opportunities granted by Gu Qingfeng, he might have never had the chance to make a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Now, in comparison to Gu Shengnan's prodigious talent, the impact on Gu Peng can be imagined.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>It was not just Gu Peng who was impacted.</p><p></p><p>In the inner courtyard,</p><p></p><p>Xu Yulan, in her long dress, had a touch of youthful charm added to her appearance after breaking through to the Grandmaster realm, despite the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the practicing Gu Shengnan, her beautiful face bearing a gentle expression.</p><p></p><p>"Shengnan's talent is truly extraordinary, aside from my husband, how far can she ultimately go?"</p><p></p><p>"Her limit, I cannot be certain, but at the very least, she should be able to reach the Martial Dao Grand Master realm for our Gu Family's children!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng smiled confidently.</p><p></p><p>If these words had come from anyone else, they would have been scoffed at.</p><p></p><p>After all, Martial Dao Grand Masters are rare, and in the past thousands of years, the appearance of Martial Dao Grand Masters in the jianghu has been as rare as phoenix feathers and qilin horns, showing how difficult it is to reach that level.</p><p></p><p>But when these words came from Gu Qingfeng's mouth, Xu Yulan did not feel much surprise.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Qingfeng's current cultivation realm has already reached a mysterious and unfathomable level, and in his eyes, the Martial Dao Grand Master realm does not seem to be that difficult to attain.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this,</p><p></p><p>Xu Yulan withdrew her gaze from Gu Shengnan and looked at Gu Qingfeng beside her.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, what realm are you currently at?"</p><p></p><p>"My realm is different from ordinary people, if you ask me what realm I am at, I cannot give you a good answer, but even if it was tens of thousands of years ago, the so-called Martial Ancestor Reborn who broke through the limits of the Martial Dao Grand Master, I would still have the confidence to subdue him."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head and said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>This sentence,</p><p></p><p>He was actually being a bit humble.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the Heavenly Dao Domain and the two great Heavenly Veins he had cultivated, Gu Qingfeng doubted whether the Martial Ancestor Reborn could even withstand a single strike from him.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't say these words out loud.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yulan nodded slightly upon hearing this, and did not ask any further questions.</p><p></p><p>As for Gu Qingfeng's strength, she was not particularly concerned about it, as long as she could be by his side, that would be enough.</p><p></p><p>In the following days,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng guided Gu Shengnan's cultivation even more frequently.</p><p></p><p>When she entered the sixth month of her martial arts journey, Gu Shengnan broke through to the Refined Blood Realm Intermediate.</p><p></p><p>In the tenth month,</p><p></p><p>Gu Shengnan broke through to the Refined Blood Realm Advanced.</p><p></p><p>In the eighteenth month,</p><p></p><p>Gu Shengnan finally cultivated the Refined Blood Realm of the Longevity Sutra to perfection, and her martial arts cultivation formally entered the Refined Blood Realm Perfection.</p><p></p><p>And this year,</p><p></p><p>Gu Shengnan was only seven and a half years old, still half a year away from eight.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng was somewhat mentally prepared, when he truly witnessed this scene, his heart was still somewhat shaken.

        <h1>Chapter 179</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Deathly silent.</p><p></p><p>Various martial arts scattered on the ground.</p><p></p><p>After a long time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's face revealed a smile, and when he looked at his own attribute panel again, he found that there had been some changes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Longevity Sutra (Perfected, Longevity Level 3)!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The Refining Bone Technique has been completed!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not have much emotional fluctuation, as if creating the Refining Bone Technique was a matter of course.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was indeed the case.</p><p></p><p>This time, Gu Yang had people send a large amount of martial arts, and combined with his previous cultivation, the difficulty for Gu Qingfeng to create the Refining Bone Technique was much lower than before.</p><p></p><p>Now.</p><p></p><p>The Refining Bone Technique is completed.</p><p></p><p>The Longevity Sutra has now been half completed.</p><p></p><p>According to Gu Qingfeng's current plan, the Longevity Sutra only involves the five realms of Body Refinement.</p><p></p><p>From refining the skin to refining the internal organs.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Refining Bone Technique has been created, the only thing left is the Marrow Cleansing Technique and the Refining Internal Organs Technique.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng habitually glanced at the information panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been enfeoffed by the court!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has perfectly refined his skin, and his strength has increased!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been guided by the Sect Master of the Divine Martial Sect, Ancient Cloud, and his cultivation has improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has unexpectedly obtained a Grandmaster inheritance!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xuan' has made some progress in cultivating the Longevity Sutra, and his strength has increased!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Xiu' has made some progress in cultivating the Longevity Sutra, and his strength has increased!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has taken the secret pills of the Divine Martial Sect, and his cultivation has increased significantly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has broken through the post-Refining Bone realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +100 Upgrade Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 100 Refining Bone Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 100 Marrow Cleansing Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 10 Refining Internal Organs Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When he saw that Gu Yang had successfully and perfectly refined his skin, Gu Qingfeng also revealed a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Perfect Skin Refinement.</p><p></p><p>Can increase lifespan by a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>For martial artists, an increase of a hundred years can change many things.</p><p></p><p>Similarly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's successful perfect skin refinement means that even if his cultivation does not make any further breakthroughs, he can still live for an extra hundred years.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>When he saw that Gu Yang had obtained a Grandmaster inheritance and taken the secret pills of the Divine Martial Sect, Gu Qingfeng was somewhat surprised in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Grandmaster inheritance is understandable.</p><p></p><p>But the secret pills of the Divine Martial Sect, which can directly allow one to break through from the middle Refining Bone realm to the post-Refining Bone realm, are quite extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>But after thinking about it, Gu Qingfeng felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Divine Martial Sect is the number one sect in the world, inheriting from the Martial Ancestor, so it is normal for them to have some secret pills that can help martial artists break through.</p><p></p><p>Moreover.</p><p></p><p>It's just allowing a Refining Bone realm martial artist to break through, not a Grandmaster realm martial artist.</p><p></p><p>In comparison.</p><p></p><p>The matter of being enfeoffed by the court is what made Gu Qingfeng's brows furrow slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Enfeoffed by the court?"</p><p></p><p>"Enfeoffed as a rebel?"</p><p></p><p>Now that Gu Yang has established himself as a king and taken over Taishan Prefecture, in the eyes of the court, he is no different from a rebel. </p><p></p><p>In the past, it would have been a heinous crime punishable by the confiscation of property and the extermination of the family, but now the court has come forward to enfeoff him, which is quite thought-provoking.</p><p></p><p>After thinking about it.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also understood the key point.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at his own attribute panel and directly promoted the Fist of Sun and Moon to the Perfected level.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The Fist of Sun and Moon has reached Perfection.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth-Level True Meaning was born.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes seemed to have become reflections of the sun and moon, his majestic vital energy surging, and it seemed that there was a powerful force behind him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The aura that was dispersed was like the interweaving of the sun and moon, or like the presence of a supreme figure that suppressed the vast expanse of the sky.</p><p></p><p>This anomaly appeared quickly.</p><p></p><p>And it also disappeared quickly.</p><p></p><p>In less than a moment.</p><p></p><p>The breakthrough of the Scripture of the Sun and Moon Fist had already been completed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Qingfeng's understanding of the Scripture of the Sun and Moon Fist had reached its peak, not inferior even to the great masters who had created the Scripture of the Sun and Moon Fist in the first place.</p><p></p><p>Improving one's martial arts through a breakthrough is not just about directly grasping power. It's as if one has cultivated a martial art for many years, and the memories and insights of that arduous cultivation emerge along with it.</p><p></p><p>In other words, Gu Qingfeng was equivalent to having contemplated and studied the Scripture of the Sun and Moon Fist for hundreds of years, having thoroughly mastered this supreme martial art, even reaching a level of returning to the essence.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, Gu Qingfeng took another look at his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng  Age: 43/3000  Realm: Extreme Dao Master Middle Stage</p><p></p><p>Martial Arts: Heaven Thunder Sword Technique (Beginner), Seven Killing Blade Technique (Killing Intent Level 3), Heaven Talisman Body (Indestructible Body Level 1), Five Viscera Scripture (Fifth Layer, Five Viscera as Deities Level 5), Primordial Treasure Mirror (Fifth Layer, Refine Viscera as Iron Level 5), Tyrannical Blade Slash (Perfected, Tyrannical Blade Intent Level 9), Crimson Flame Divine Skill (Ninth Layer Perfected, Crimson Flame Palm Strength Level 8), Prajna True Scripture (Thirteenth Layer Perfected, Prajna True Body Level 12), Scripture of the Sun and Moon Fist (Perfected, Sun and Moon Fist Intent Level 9), Wind and Thunder Blade Technique (Perfected, Wind and Thunder Blade Intent Level 3), Heavenly Vein True Scripture (Second Layer), Longevity Technique (Perfected, Longevity Level 3)  Improvement Points: 54...</p><p></p><p>This year, Gu Qingfeng was 43 years old.</p><p></p><p>His martial dao realm had advanced to the Extreme Dao Master Middle Stage.</p><p></p><p>The perfection of a supreme martial art had greatly enhanced Gu Qingfeng's strength, allowing his original realm to take another step forward.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Extreme Dao Master Initial Stage, after breaking through to the Extreme Dao Master Middle Stage, Gu Qingfeng felt that his vital energy and physical strength had become even more powerful than before.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the role of true qi had actually diminished significantly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was clear about the reason for this.</p><p></p><p>Martial artists emphasize the tempering of the physical body, with the cultivation of vital energy as the main focus, while the appearance of true qi was a bit of a detour.</p><p></p><p>After all, it is not easy for martial artists to cultivate vital energy, so once they reach the perfection of refining the viscera, the truly powerful experts who can break through to become Vital Energy Masters are few and far between.</p><p></p><p>Some martial artists who find it difficult to break through to the Vital Energy Master realm instead choose to cultivate true qi, thereby attaining mastery through an alternative method, becoming Innate Masters.</p><p></p><p>However, vital energy is still the foundation for martial artists.</p><p></p><p>This is why Vital Energy Masters are stronger than Innate Masters.</p><p></p><p>As for Extreme Dao Masters, they are the next level of transformation from Vital Energy Masters.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the vital energy of Extreme Dao Masters is vastly superior to that of the so-called Vital Energy Masters.</p><p></p><p>"With my current Extreme Dao Master Middle Stage cultivation, even without the power of two great heavenly veins, I would be able to suppress the Ancient Overlord Emperor with ease!"</p><p></p><p>"If I were to activate the power of a heavenly vein, a single heavenly vein would be enough to instantly slay him!"</p><p></p><p>A gleam of determination flashed in Gu Qingfeng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, compared to the existence that had left behind its bloodline, his cultivation was still lacking.</p><p></p><p>But these problems were not significant.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation would steadily accumulate step by step.</p><p></p><p>In the future, Gu Qingfeng would have the confidence to confront that Nine Heavens Buddha.</p><p></p><p>Before that, he must strive to continuously elevate his cultivation realm.</p><p></p><p>Each breakthrough to a higher level of Extreme Dao Master requires a substantial accumulation of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Scripture of the Sun and Moon Fist had been perfected, further breakthroughs would require too much effort, so he needed to focus on other aspects to make progress.</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Gu Qingfeng turned his gaze to the supreme martial arts of various sects.

        <h1>Chapter 43</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked down at the other person with an indifferent expression.</p><p></p><p>"Speak, what is the purpose of your coming here?"</p><p></p><p>"Gu Qingfeng, I am a subordinate of the Divine Martial King. If you dare to lay a hand on me, you will be offending the Divine Martial King... Ah!!!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Sitian finished his cold warning, he saw Gu Qingfeng step on one of his palms with his right foot, grinding the sole down forcefully. Instantly, the palm became a bloody mess, with the bones even shattering under the immense force.</p><p></p><p>The excruciating pain made the other party let out a miserable scream.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes were ice-cold.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you haven't grasped the current situation. I'm asking you, and if you utter even half a nonsensical word, I'll make you wish you were dead!"</p><p></p><p>"Speak."</p><p></p><p>"What is the purpose of your coming here?"</p><p></p><p>This time, </p><p></p><p>Sitian did not dare to waste words or threaten with words again. With a fearful expression, he said:</p><p></p><p>"The King has heard that you have destroyed the Iron Bone Gang and unified the entire Baishi Path. He wants you to serve him!"</p><p></p><p>"The one behind the Iron Bone Gang is the Divine Martial King. I killed Luo Yu and destroyed the Iron Bone Gang. Does Fei Jing not want to avenge them?"</p><p></p><p>"A small gang like the Iron Bone Gang is not worth the King's vengeance. The fact that the Gu family could destroy the Iron Bone Gang and unify the Baishi Path shows that the Gu family has more potential.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Gu family is willing to serve the King, the King will certainly not be stingy with the benefits.</p><p></p><p>With the Gu family master's talent, if he can obtain the King's resources, he may even have the chance to break through to the Refining Impurity realm in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Sitian did not hide anything, directly telling everything.</p><p></p><p>In the end,</p><p></p><p>He still wanted to win over Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the current situation, if he could not win over the other party, he might not be able to leave the Gu family alive.</p><p></p><p>Sitian's response</p><p></p><p>did not surprise Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>From this, it can also be seen that the Divine Martial King is somewhat cold-hearted and only values ability without much consideration for personal feelings.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, this is also normal.</p><p></p><p>Those who achieve great things do not get bogged down in trivial matters.</p><p></p><p>The other party can control several commanderies, which is not without reason.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng asked, "If I don't agree, what will Fei Jing do?"</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Sitian hesitated a bit, and Gu Qingfeng immediately pressed down harder with his shoe, causing the other party's face to turn deathly pale, not daring to have the slightest hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"The King's intention is that if the Gu family is unwilling to submit, then there is no need for their existence!"</p><p></p><p>"How much power does Fei Jing have in Guangyang Prefecture?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure about that..."</p><p></p><p>Sitian first said one sentence, then quickly added another, afraid that Gu Qingfeng would not believe him.</p><p></p><p>"I really don't know. Only the commanding officer would know the movements of the Black Mysterious Guard. We, the centurions, can only understand a small portion of the other Black Mysterious Guard's situation.</p><p></p><p>However, the prefect of Taishan Commandery has been continuously suppressing the Black Mysterious Guard. It's not easy for us to act in Taishan Commandery."</p><p></p><p>"How many experts does Fei Jing have under his command?"</p><p></p><p>"The King has many powerful experts under his command, but I don't know the specific number of experts."</p><p></p><p>"What is Fei Jing's own cultivation level?"</p><p></p><p>"The King's cultivation is profound, at least at the Refining Impurity realm, and it is rumored that he may have already reached the Grandmaster realm, but I'm not sure of the specifics."</p><p></p><p>For all of Gu Qingfeng's questions, Sitian answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>Not answering</p><p></p><p>would be a dead end.</p><p></p><p>After a long while,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng confirmed that he had no more questions to ask. He looked at Fei Jing and said,</p><p></p><p>"You have trespassed into the Gu family, which should have been a dead end for you. But today, I will give you a chance. Write down all the martial arts you have cultivated, and I may consider sparing your life."</p><p></p><p>"Are you serious about this?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure about this?" </p><p></p><p>"Gu certainly does not speak false words!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's words caused Sitian's expression to fluctuate, and finally, he gritted his teeth and made a decision. "I beg the Gu family master to set my bones, and I will do as instructed!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Qingfeng wasted no time and completely reset Sitian's dislocated limbs, though Sitian's left hand was already badly decayed, which did not affect his ability to write with his right hand.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng had someone bring writing materials, and instructed Sitian to write down all his martial arts techniques from memory.</p><p></p><p>The latter endured the pain in his left hand and obediently wrote everything down.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>An hour later, Sitian had written down all the martial arts, his face somewhat pale from blood loss.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, all the martial arts are here. I hope the Gu master can fulfill his promise!"</p><p></p><p>"If there are no issues with the martial arts, I, Gu, will certainly keep my word."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng picked up the papers, the ink not yet fully dry, and scanned them quickly, committing all the martial arts to memory in no time.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Gu Qingfeng checked the attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>As expected, the corresponding martial arts had been recorded.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The "Hundred Tempering Golden Body" (not yet mastered) and the "Seven Killing Blade Technique" (not yet mastered)!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>These two martial arts were top-grade, belonging to the pinnacle of the upper echelon, directly pointing to the realm of bone refinement perfection. The "Hundred Tempering Golden Body" focused on tempering and breakthrough, while the "Seven Killing Blade Technique" was primarily for combat.</p><p></p><p>The latter's profundity was much deeper than the "Heavenly Thunder Sword Technique", being a pure military martial art focused on slaughter.</p><p></p><p>Normally, such upper-grade martial arts would be completely inaccessible to ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>To have obtained these two top-grade martial arts from the Black Mysterious Guard was an unexpected windfall.</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts are fine, you may leave now."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Gu master!"</p><p></p><p>Sitian's heart, which had been in suspense, finally relaxed. Just as he was about to leave Gu's residence, a sword beam sliced through the night, piercing his chest.</p><p></p><p>Thud! Sitian's body, which had just leaped up, came crashing down.</p><p></p><p>Then Gu Qingfeng struck out with a palm, directly shattering his head in the face of Sitian's disbelieving gaze. The headless corpse twitched briefly, then became motionless.</p><p></p><p>"I only promised to consider letting you live, but upon reflection, it's better for you to die here!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was cold.</p><p></p><p>From the moment the Iron Bone Gang was destroyed, he and the Divine Martial King had already torn off their masks.</p><p></p><p>Even if Sitian had followed his instructions and served the Divine Martial King, it would not necessarily have brought him any benefits.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple - this was Guangyang Prefecture. Taishan Commandery had been under the control of the imperial court up to this point. If the news of the Gu family siding with the Divine Martial King were to be leaked, their fate would not be a good one.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, given the Divine Martial King's fickle and unscrupulous nature, even if the Gu family served him, they might not necessarily gain much in return.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, Gu Qingfeng had no habit of being someone's dog.</p><p></p><p>So from the moment Sitian appeared, his fate had already been sealed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng simply saw that Sitian had delivered his message efficiently, so he did not torture him and instead gave him a quick death.</p><p></p><p>With Sitian's death, Gu Qingfeng had now firmly positioned himself against the Divine Martial King.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Qingfeng was unconcerned about these matters. If the Divine Martial King wanted to deal with him, he would at least have to conquer Guangyang Prefecture first.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 127</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"How interesting!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng tried to break his own skin and squeeze out a little fresh blood, only to find that the blood had a faint golden color and contained a powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>The strength of this aura was not just manifested in its power, but in the level of life, giving a more noble feeling.</p><p></p><p>"Transformation of the level of life!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that when entering the stage of perfect refinement of impurities, the warrior's level of life can begin to transform?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression changed slightly, and then he left the Whetstone Hall and entered the Demon Suppression Prison.</p><p></p><p>The current Demon Suppression Prison.</p><p></p><p>It actually held three evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng skillfully opened the golden coffin that sealed the Yin Gui, and then directly cut off a part of the Yin Gui, trying to extinguish the existence of the Yin Gui with his own spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>When his spiritual power collided with the remnant of the Yin Gui, it was like hot oil meeting cold water, instantly causing a violent reaction.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, Gu Qingfeng could even hear a piercing wail coming from the remnant of the Yin Gui.</p><p></p><p>But he paid no attention to it, and instead fully mobilized his spiritual power to continuously consume the remnant of the Yin Gui.</p><p></p><p>After a long time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's spiritual power was almost exhausted, but there was no disappointment on his face, but rather an undisguised smile.</p><p></p><p>Because the small piece of severed finger that represented the remnant of the Yin Gui had completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"It really works!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect refinement of impurities can cause changes in the heart, thereby enhancing the warrior's level of life, and the rumor that evil spirits cannot be destroyed will also be completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>My current level of life is probably higher than that of the so-called sorcerers, although it is still a bit lower than the evil spirits, but as long as I continue to improve my cultivation, truly slaying the evil spirits will no longer be a problem!"</p><p></p><p>Although for now, he had to use up his entire spiritual power just to consume a small piece of the Yin Gui's severed finger, which still seemed to be a long way from truly eliminating an evil spirit.</p><p></p><p>But one thing must be understood.</p><p></p><p>Many things, the real difficulty is just at the beginning.</p><p></p><p>In the past, evil spirits were difficult to extinguish, and even a small piece of a severed finger was equally difficult to shake.</p><p></p><p>But now it's different.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has been able to extinguish a piece of the Yin Gui's severed finger, and when his cultivation level improves in the future, truly eliminating an evil spirit will certainly not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>This shows that the rumor that evil spirits cannot be destroyed can be broken.</p><p></p><p>In comparison.</p><p></p><p>Although sorcerers are powerful, they also do not have the ability to truly eliminate evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>If the evil spirits in this world have the highest level of life, then the sorcerers who bear the evil spirits must be one level lower than the evil spirits, while the warriors are half a level lower than the sorcerers.</p><p></p><p>This level of life has little to do with strength.</p><p></p><p>This is why.</p><p></p><p>Sorcerers can be stronger than warriors, but warriors can also slay sorcerers, but sorcerers cannot slay evil spirits when facing them.</p><p></p><p>Now.</p><p></p><p>With the transformation of his heart, Gu Qingfeng's level of life has further improved, already reaching half a level higher than sorcerers, and only half a level lower than evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>As long as he can truly raise the five stages of refinement of impurities to perfection, Gu Qingfeng believes that his level of life will definitely be able to transform again, reaching the same level as the evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Demon Suppression Prison, Gu Qingfeng felt that the sunlight had become much brighter.</p><p></p><p>Evil spirits cannot be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>It was like a huge mountain pressing on his heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, such an immortal existence, no matter how much it is suppressed, is ultimately useless.</p><p></p><p>So-called suppression.</p><p></p><p>One day it will have the possibility of breaking the seal.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Only by truly exterminating the evil spirits can a lasting solution be achieved.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, Gu Qingfeng sees the hope of vanquishing the evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>As long as he can cultivate the Five Impure Realms to the perfect level, he will have the chance to break through the level of life and truly slay the evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>Back at the Grinding Knife Hall, Gu Qingfeng continued to cultivate the Prajna Sutra.</p><p></p><p>According to his plan, if he can complete the Five Impure Realms once, the subsequent cultivation of the techniques related to the Impure Realms will become much easier.</p><p></p><p>With the difficulty of the Prajna Sutra, Gu Qingfeng was confident that he could successfully cultivate the Five Impure Realms within half a year.</p><p></p><p>However, when he actually started the cultivation, Gu Qingfeng found that things were not as simple as he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the past, when the cultivation of the Five Impure Realms in the Chaos Precious Mirror or the Scarlet Flame Divine Skill was almost divinely assisted, the cultivation of the Prajna Sutra was completely different.</p><p></p><p>It was abstruse, and every step was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>After half a month, Gu Qingfeng's expression became slightly gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"The difficulty coefficient of cultivating the Prajna Sutra has increased greatly, which should be related to the perfect refinement of the Impure Realms. My current refinement of the five viscera is only one step away from perfect transformation.</p><p></p><p>So to take this step, it will require time and gradual polishing, only then will there be the possibility of a breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Gu Qingfeng's original plan to first cultivate the Prajna Sutra to the level of the perfected Five Impure Realms, and then use the promotion points to break through the Patriarch realm, was thwarted.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Gu Qingfeng used another forty promotion points to directly upgrade the Prajna Sutra from the fifth layer to the seventh layer, achieving two realm breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>In return, two of Gu Qingfeng's viscera had been perfectly refined, making his overall strength even more formidable, and his life level was also gradually rising.</p><p></p><p>"With my current blood and qi strength, I can directly grind away not only a Shadow Deception Finger, but even a Shadow Deception palm. However, to truly slay a Shadow Deception in one breath, I'm not quite capable of that yet."</p><p></p><p>Feeling the changes in his body, Gu Qingfeng realized that he had become much stronger compared to when only his heart had mutated. </p><p></p><p>However, this was still not enough. In Gu Qingfeng's view, this strength was still insufficient to truly slay the evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>After all, in a life-and-death confrontation, who would have the time to gradually grind down the evil spirits, as they are not inanimate objects and will not willingly submit to annihilation.</p><p></p><p>The evil spirits can run and resist.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, what Gu Qingfeng needs to do is to truly elevate his life level to the same level as the evil spirits, so that slaying them would become much easier.</p><p></p><p>However, after glancing at the remaining three promotion points, Gu Qingfeng gave up the idea of further advancement.</p><p></p><p>From now on, he will wait. Wait for the descendants of the Gu family to make a breakthrough, then he can directly use the promotion points to completely refine his five viscera.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Gu Qingfeng can start to break through the Patriarch realm.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, although I cannot truly erase the evil spirits, if I were to face Shen Wudao again, I believe a single strike would be enough to slay him."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was confident.</p><p></p><p>Although he has not broken through to the Patriarch realm, his strength is no longer comparable to the past. </p><p></p><p>The only uncertainty is that Gu Qingfeng is not sure how his strength compares to the rumored great Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

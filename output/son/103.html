        <h1>Chapter 103</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this time, Gu Qingfeng came over. </p><p></p><p>Gu Yang saw the newcomer and hurriedly bowed in greeting: "Father!"</p><p></p><p>"How is Lai Niang doing?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked towards the tightly closed door of the side room, from which sounds of anguish could be heard.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang shook his head: "There is still no news!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Gu Yang could not help but pace back and forth again, his expression changing constantly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng furrowed his brow and sternly rebuked: "What kind of conduct is this, all flustered and agitated!"</p><p></p><p>These words made Gu Yang's face stiffen, and he no longer dared to pace about. Even the anxious and worried look on his face diminished somewhat.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Gu family manor, the only one Gu Yang truly feared, or rather revered, was Gu Qingfeng. Especially now that Gu Qingfeng's cultivation had grown ever more profound, and he had honed his own blade intent in the Grinding Knife Hall, emanating an indescribable aura of might that made others not dare to look him directly in the eye.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Yang forcibly calming down, Gu Qingfeng kept his gaze fixed on his information panel.</p><p></p><p>This time, it was also a moment of verification.</p><p></p><p>Time passed bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the information panel that had been still for a long time refreshed with new text:</p><p></p><p>"You have a new offspring born!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Qingfeng's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"It worked as expected!"</p><p></p><p>Just as this thought crossed his mind, the sound of a newborn baby's cries came from the side room, and the midwife came out with a beaming smile, repeatedly bowing in congratulation.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Young Master Gu, Patriarch Gu, the Lady has given birth to a daughter, both mother and child are safe and sound!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Gu Yang immediately rushed into the room.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the servant beside him and said indifferently, "Bring a reward of a hundred taels of silver."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Patriarch Gu!!" The midwife's face lit up with joy.</p><p></p><p>This was the benefit of dealing with a prominent family - if there were any problems, the responsibility would be hard to escape, but if the task was accomplished, the rewards could be remarkably generous.</p><p></p><p>A hundred taels of silver. For the common person, this would be considered unimaginable wealth.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Gu Yang came before Gu Qingfeng, cradling a baby girl.</p><p></p><p>"Please, Father, bestow a name upon the child!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the infant before him and then smiled, "Call her Shengnan."</p><p></p><p>"Shengnan!"</p><p></p><p>"Gu Shengnan!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang murmured the name, his face then breaking into a joyous expression.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Shengnan is a wonderful name, thank you, Father, for bestowing it!"</p><p></p><p>"If the child is to cultivate exceptional innate talents, she must be nourished from a young age. This is something you must remember. Furthermore, the higher a warrior's cultivation, the more difficult it is for them to have offspring.</p><p></p><p>If possible, you should try to leave behind several children before breaking through the Refine Bone Realm, in order to strengthen the Gu family bloodline."</p><p></p><p>In the end, Gu Qingfeng added another piece of advice.</p><p></p><p>From the fact that Gu Shengnan could be recorded by the information panel, Gu Qingfeng had vaguely understood the true use of this "golden finger".</p><p></p><p>Expand the branches and increase the family. </p><p></p><p>Currently, the Gu family only had a few members, and this advantage was not yet apparent, but if the Gu family bloodline grew to hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of people, it would be truly formidable.</p><p></p><p>Of course, whether this conjecture was correct, Gu Qingfeng could not yet confirm for certain.</p><p></p><p>This matter would require further verification.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, in the Gu family's rear garden, Gu Xuan and Gu Xiu appeared.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On their youthful faces, there was an undisguised excitement.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng arrived, the two of them performed a proper salute.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Father!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded, his gaze falling upon the two of them.</p><p></p><p>Although they were only six years old, due to their constant tempering and refining of their physiques through medicinal baths, their bodies had grown quite robust, not much different from those who were several years older.</p><p></p><p>"You two are no longer young. Today, I shall impart to you the methods of martial arts cultivation, and I hope you will comprehend them well!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The two of them hastily responded.</p><p></p><p>They had long harbored an interest in the martial arts, seeing many in the Gu family compound skilled in the martial arts, making them eager to learn.</p><p></p><p>Alas.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had repeatedly emphasized that they were not yet of age to cultivate the martial arts, so they dared not disobey the order, and no one in the Gu family compound had the audacity to secretly teach them.</p><p></p><p>"The technique I am about to teach you is the Gu family's introductory fist art, known as the Gu Family Fist. While it is not the pinnacle of martial arts, it will allow you to refine your foundations, and with it, you may one day progress even further."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng spoke slowly.</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family Fist of today was different from the original.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, Gu Qingfeng had made improvements to it, transforming a martial art that could barely reach the threshold of Blood Refining into one that could rival the top-tier mid-grade martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had incorporated the advantages of his Perfect Skin Refining and Perfect Blood Refining into this fist art.</p><p></p><p>Although the Gu Family Fist still could not grant the practitioners Perfect Skin Refining or Perfect Blood Refining, it could greatly compensate for the deficiencies of other techniques.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, with the Gu Family Fist as the foundation, even if one could not achieve a perfect physique, they could still attain a level of physical prowess close to perfection.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng believed that the Gu Family Fist was truly among the top mid-grade martial arts. Even the once formidable Scorching Sun Palm might not be able to surpass it.</p><p></p><p>The true advantage of the Scorching Sun Palm lay in its ability to assist the cultivator in refining their bones after achieving Blood Refining mastery, allowing them to passively enter the Bone Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>This alone made the Scorching Sun Palm superior to many mid-grade martial arts, even more important than some high-grade ones.</p><p></p><p>However, in terms of foundational cultivation, the Gu Family Fist had an edge over the Scorching Sun Palm.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the excited expressions on Gu Xuan's and Gu Xuan's faces, Gu Qingfeng wasted no time in explaining the incantations and breathing techniques of the Gu Family Fist, ensuring they could remember them, before proceeding to demonstrate the techniques.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Gu Qingfeng completed a set of the fist art, intending to ask if they had remembered it, but seeing their bewildered expressions, he simply shook his head slightly and patiently demonstrated the techniques again.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, the two had memorized the sequence of the fist art and the corresponding mental cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was quite satisfied with this.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of their innate talents, the fact that they could remember a martial art so quickly on their first encounter was already far superior to ordinary people in terms of memory and comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how long it will take for them to truly enter the path of the martial arts," Gu Qingfeng thought to himself as he watched the two diligently practicing the Gu Family Fist.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

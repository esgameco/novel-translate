        <h1>Chapter 84</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Tyrannical Blade Slash -</p><p></p><p>This terrifying blade intent came rushing towards him, making Wen Jiao feel as if his entire spirit and lifeblood had been frozen. Immediately after, the icy blade light flashed before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Against this single blade strike,</p><p></p><p>All power was rendered futile.</p><p></p><p>The tyrannical blade cleaved through the waves, with the force of splitting mountains, and fell heavily upon Wen Jiao.</p><p></p><p>The blade light flashed and vanished.</p><p></p><p>Wen Jiao's body stood motionless at the spot.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the other with a gaze of shock and disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Master-level true intent - you have actually comprehended the master-level true intent, you are a half-step master!!"</p><p></p><p>As Wen Jiao's words fell, a bloody trace appeared on the other's brow, which quickly spread across his entire body. In the next moment, his body was split in two, with a large amount of fresh blood and internal organs spilling onto the ground.</p><p></p><p>The sect leader of Crimson Flame Peak had perished on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after,</p><p></p><p>An extremely chilling and sinister aura directly erupted from Wen Jiao's corpse, and a demonic entity with a completely black body, like an infant, crawled out from the other's remains, appearing like a true evil spirit emerging from the depths of hell.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Before the demonic entity could act, Gu Qingfeng swung his blade, directly pinning the demonic entity to the ground. The scorching yang energy from his blood power merged into the demon-slaying blade, colliding with the entity's yin energy, causing a violent trembling sound, like boiling oil meeting water.</p><p></p><p>"Howl!!"</p><p></p><p>The demonic entity struggled and twisted violently, letting out an inhuman howl that caused all of Gu Clan Village's disciples to change their expressions in alarm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pressed down the demonic entity with his blade, and solemnly said to the approaching Gu Yang behind him, "Yang'er, quickly go to the Demon-Subduing Prison and bring a golden coffin!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang heard the order and immediately turned and entered the Gu Clan Village.</p><p></p><p>Soon,</p><p></p><p>He returned carrying a golden coffin.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng forcefully opened the coffin lid, then used his long blade to lift the demonic entity and swiftly toss it into the coffin. He then closed the lid and completely sealed it within.</p><p></p><p>As the iron chains wrapped around it, the trembling of the golden coffin gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>"Take it to the Demon-Subduing Prison!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng calmly spoke, then turned his gaze back to Wen Jiao's corpse.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng found two thin secret manuals on the other's body - one was a sorcerer's demonic cultivation technique, and the other was the martial arts of Crimson Flame Peak.</p><p></p><p>Having done this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said to the nearby Gu Peng, "Reassemble this person's body and hang it on the east gate of White Stone City, to serve as a warning to all under heaven!"</p><p></p><p>"I will carry out the order, master!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Peng clasped his fist in reverence, his face filled with awe.</p><p></p><p>He had heard of the reputation of Crimson Flame Peak's sect leader Wen Jiao, who was a top expert of the Crimson Flame Sect and had caused the downfall of many demonic cultivators.</p><p></p><p>This person's strength was among the top in the entire Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Yet,</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful expert was felled by a single strike from Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>The strength of their clan leader truly filled Gu Peng with deep reverence.</p><p></p><p>The remaining disciples of the Gu Clan Village also snapped out of their shock, and their expressions became increasingly fervent as they looked at Gu Qingfeng's back.</p><p></p><p>"Our lord's divine might!"</p><p>"Our lord's supreme martial arts, how dare these demonic entities come to our Gu Clan Village and cause trouble!"</p><p></p><p>This was the sky of their Gu Clan Village.</p><p></p><p>To join such a force, with such a powerful backer, was something many could only envy.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the praises around him and feeling the numerous admiring gazes, Gu Qingfeng's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>"You all remember, the Gu Clan Village does not actively seek trouble, but we also do not fear it. When you go out, do not bring disgrace to the Gu Clan Village!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"We shall heed the teachings of the lord!" </p><p></p><p>The crowd spoke in unison.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>In the study.</p><p></p><p>Two secret manuals were placed before Gu Qingfeng. But his attention was not on the secret manuals, but rather on recalling the recent battle with Wen Jiao and the details within.</p><p></p><p>To an outsider, it seemed that Gu Qingfeng had easily slain his opponent with a single stroke.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Only Gu Qingfeng himself knew the truth.</p><p></p><p>That single stroke contained the full force of his will, the peak of his vital energy and spirit, and the slaying of Wen Jiao was a natural consequence.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>This does not mean that Wen Jiao was weak.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary.</p><p></p><p>Wen Jiao's strength was formidable.</p><p></p><p>If they had engaged in normal combat, suppressing him would not have been so easy, and that was not what Gu Qingfeng desired.</p><p></p><p>In the current chaotic state of the world, the Gu family manor must display sufficient strength to stand firm in this turbulent era.</p><p></p><p>The previous annihilation of the Qingyang Sect was not enough to awe the various factions.</p><p></p><p>After all, while the Qingyang Sect was a major sect in Guangyang Prefecture, it was still far inferior to the thousand-year-old sects like the Chiyan Sect.</p><p></p><p>Wen Jiao, as the peak master of the Chiyan Sect, was a formidable presence within the entire sect.</p><p></p><p>Now.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had slain him with a single stroke, and the news, once spread, would be enough to shock the four corners.</p><p></p><p>In that case.</p><p></p><p>If other powers were to make a move against the Gu family manor or set their sights on the Baishi Dao, they would have to carefully consider their options.</p><p></p><p>After all —</p><p></p><p>Before taking action.</p><p></p><p>They would at least need to ponder whether they could withstand that single stroke.</p><p></p><p>"Wen Jiao was originally a Refining Filth Realm martial artist, having cultivated evil arts for many years, and had already broken through the Commanding Spirit Realm. Such a foundation of strength was not only renowned within the Chiyan Sect, but also throughout the entire Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>In other words, my current strength, even at the peak of the Commanding Spirit Realm, is not without the capital to contend with him!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes gleamed with insight.</p><p></p><p>Half-Step Sect Master!</p><p></p><p>He recalled the words Wen Jiao had spoken before his death.</p><p></p><p>Previously.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had believed that only Refining Filth martial artists who had comprehended the true essence could be truly called a Minor Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>But now, it seems the world does not hold the same view.</p><p></p><p>Refining Filth is considered a Minor Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>If one comprehends the true essence, they can be called a Half-Step Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Above the Half-Step Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Lies the true Sect Master realm.</p><p></p><p>With these thoughts settled, Gu Qingfeng turned his gaze back to the two secret manuals before him.</p><p></p><p>The Refining Spirit Technique!</p><p>The Chiyan Divine Technique!</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>Among them.</p><p>The Refining Spirit Technique is a secret art for cultivating evil arts within the body, and from this, Gu Qingfeng also understood the name of the evil entity that Wen Jiao had harbored within himself.</p><p></p><p>The Brain Demon!</p><p>Feeding on the brains of living beings! This Refining Spirit Technique specializes in the cultivation of any evil entity that resides within the physical body.</p><p></p><p>Among the three secret arts of cultivating evil arts, the Refining Spirit Technique is the most powerful.</p><p></p><p>This is because, in the previous techniques, whether it was the Communicating Treasure Art or the Longevity Dao Scripture, the recorded methods of cultivating evil arts were only suitable for hosting evil entities at the level of Bone Refining and below.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Longevity Dao Scripture could host the Shadow Demon, but if faced with a Brain Demon on par with the Blood Cleansing Demon, the methods in the Longevity Dao Scripture would most likely end in failure.</p><p></p><p>But the Refining Spirit Technique is different.</p><p></p><p>This sect's cultivation technique is the supreme secret manual for hosting Refining Filth Realm evil entities.</p><p></p><p>This alone makes it incomparable to the previous two secret manuals.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 91</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the token left behind by Zuo Li, his expression unchanged. He casually reached out with his right hand and directly grasped the token.</p><p></p><p>On the token, the words "Divine Martial Army" were clearly written.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Gu Qingfeng clenched his five fingers tightly, and the token made of refined iron gradually crumbled into powder that fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Yang also walked out from the back of the hall.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the token of the Divine Martial Army turned to powder, his face showed confusion: "Father, why did you not agree to join the Divine Martial Army?"</p><p></p><p>When Zuo Li came, Gu Yang was discussing other matters with Gu Qingfeng, and later when the other party came here, he had temporarily withdrawn to the inner hall.</p><p></p><p>However, as a martial artist, his hearing and vision were sharp. Listening clearly to the conversation in the hall was an easy task for him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's blood surged, blowing away the remaining powder in his palm, and then he asked calmly, "What do you think of the Divine Martial Army?"</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Martial Army is indeed not weak in strength. In just over a decade, they have been able to annex three prefectures, commanding a million-strong army, and are backed by the ancient Taiyang Sword Sect, a venerable sect."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang answered without hesitation, stating the advantages of the Divine Martial Army. After all, these things were easy to know as long as one made some inquiries.</p><p></p><p>To this, Gu Qingfeng shook his head slightly: "It cannot be denied that Pei Jing's strength is indeed not weak, but compared to the true dragon that has ruled the world for three thousand years, Pei Jing is still too weak.</p><p></p><p>The nine states and thirty-six prefectures of the world, he Pei Jing only controls three prefectures.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these three prefectures are also at the lower end among the thirty-six prefectures."</p><p></p><p>"Now, the various warlords have risen, and each has a powerful force backing them, wanting to divide the true dragon and establish their own dominance."</p><p></p><p>"Pei Jing may have the possibility of sitting on that position in the future, but it is only a possibility, and his chances of success are not high at the moment."</p><p></p><p>Pausing here, Gu Qingfeng continued.</p><p></p><p>"In the current chaotic world, it is not a good thing to hastily choose a side. If the Gu family manor is weak and cannot maintain its independence in the overwhelming tide, then so be it.</p><p></p><p>But now the strength of the Gu family manor is not weak, at least in this chaotic world, it has the capital to make its own choices."</p><p></p><p>"In this case, why should we hurry to declare our stance!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this is Guangyang Prefecture of Taishan Prefecture, which is still under the control of the court. If the Gu family manor allies with the Divine Martial Army, and the news leaks out, the consequences would be grave!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng would not naively believe that the Taihe Dynasty was so weak that it could be easily manipulated.</p><p></p><p>After all, the dynasty had stood for three thousand years. Its foundation was not something that ordinary forces could compare to.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, the various warlords were rising, and there were continuous natural disasters, but it had not yet reached the point of true demise.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family manor was located in Guangyang Prefecture, but if they secretly colluded with the Divine Martial Army, unless they were completely reckless, there was no real necessity for them to do so.</p><p></p><p>This was the reason why Gu Qingfeng refused Zuo Li's recruitment. It was not that the offer from the Divine Martial Army was not good enough, but that in the current situation, the Gu family manor had no need to take such risks.</p><p></p><p>Steady and stable progress was the proper approach for the Gu family manor.</p><p></p><p>Becoming a Half-Step Sect Master was not Gu Qingfeng's goal. Even Sect Master or Grand Sect Master were not what he wanted.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through the limits of the martial dao and achieving an even higher realm, that was Gu Qingfeng's true goal.</p><p></p><p>"Father's words are absolutely right. It was my short-sightedness this time!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression showed understanding. He had not thought so deeply about it.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng glanced at him and shook his head slightly, "You should..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Young one, in the future you will understand these things on your own. For now, the reputation of the Gu Family Manor is my priority. As long as Guangyang Prefecture does not fall, the White Stone Path will be temporarily safe.</p><p></p><p>In the coming period, you should focus on improving your strength first!"</p><p></p><p>"I understand, father."</p><p></p><p>After Left Li left, </p><p></p><p>In just a few days, there were other forces coming to visit.</p><p></p><p>Among them was a familiar face from the Exorcism Bureau, Jiang Qin. Compared to his previous aloof attitude, this time Jiang Qin was much more humble, at least treating the two as equals.</p><p></p><p>Their purpose was still the same as before - they wanted Gu Qingfeng to join the Exorcism Bureau.</p><p></p><p>The difference was,</p><p></p><p>This time,</p><p></p><p>Jiang Qin's offer was very generous.</p><p></p><p>At least,</p><p></p><p>It was no worse than the conditions Pei Jing had offered.</p><p></p><p>After that, there were also other sects and noble families, including the Zhuo family, all wanting to recruit Gu Qingfeng. Gu Qingfeng rejected them one by one.</p><p></p><p>In response,</p><p></p><p>These people simply left with a smile, without any intention of making a scene.</p><p></p><p>This scene made Gu Qingfeng increasingly aware of the importance of strong strength.</p><p></p><p>"In times of chaos, only those with enough fist power can truly prevail, even if the other party is deeply dissatisfied, they have to endure it!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng mused.</p><p></p><p>If he was already at the Half-Saint Realm, then reaching the Saint Realm would be even more formidable.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also indirectly understood something.</p><p></p><p>That is, the Half-Saint Realm is not the only path for cultivators of the Impure Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators of the Impure Martial Arts can only be called Minor Saints, and then they need to break through the shackles of the Impure Martial Arts to become Saint Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Above the Saint Realm, there are also True Saint Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Only by achieving the True Saint Realm can one have the qualifications to assault the Grand Saint Realm.</p><p></p><p>To become a True Saint Realm expert, one must comprehend the corresponding level of Dao.</p><p></p><p>The Half-Saint Realm,</p><p></p><p>Is equivalent to the seedling of a True Saint Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Once a Half-Saint Realm breaks through to become a Saint Realm expert, they can directly crush ordinary Saint Realm experts and become the top existence among Saint Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>At this point,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng truly understood why these forces were so eager to recruit him.</p><p></p><p>A powerful Minor Saint is naturally not treated this way, but if it is a strong cultivator with the potential to become a True Saint Realm expert, it would be different.</p><p></p><p>In the martial dao of the world,</p><p></p><p>Grand Saint Realm experts are extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>True Saint Realm experts are almost the strongest in the martial dao of the world.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On this day,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng consumed the Great Sun Yang Qi, and his entire body's blood and qi suddenly boiled, with the pure Yang Qi in his blood and qi increasing significantly.</p><p></p><p>"The Fifth Layer of the Azure Yang Technique is complete!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>Small-scale breakthroughs no longer caused much inner turmoil for him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Peng came.</p><p></p><p>"Your subordinate pays respects to the Manor Lord."</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was indifferent, unaffected by external matters.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng cupped his hands and said, "I report to the Manor Lord that one of the outer court's registered disciples has successfully stepped into the martial dao!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, a gleam of light flashed in Gu Qingfeng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>If he remembered correctly, even the earliest batch of registered disciples had only been here for about a month.</p><p></p><p>In just a month, to have stepped into the martial dao, this meant that there was a top-tier genius among this batch of registered disciples.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng immediately said,</p><p></p><p>"Bring that person to me!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

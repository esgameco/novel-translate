        <h1>Chapter 133</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The blood-red blade light slashed through the sky, the tyrannical and unparalleled sword intent surging forth, causing Jiang Ning's pupils to dilate involuntarily, the expression of terror just starting to appear on his face before becoming frozen.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after.</p><p></p><p>A bloody trace appeared on Jiang Ning's brow, and in the next breath, his opponent's body was suddenly split into two halves.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A terrifying and icy aura suddenly erupted, with an evil entity reviving from Jiang Ning's corpse, and then it bent down and began to frantically devour Jiang Ning's flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>This scene.</p><p></p><p>Left both parties dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>In the next instant.</p><p></p><p>The Demon-Slaying Sword let out a trembling hum, and then the long sword struck towards the evil entity, instantly pinning the one that was devouring Jiang Ning's corpse firmly to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!!"</p><p></p><p>The evil entity let out an unwilling roar, its inhuman body thrashing wildly, but it could not break free from the suppression of the Demon-Slaying Sword.</p><p></p><p>All of this.</p><p></p><p>Happened in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Until this moment.</p><p></p><p>The crowd finally snapped out of their daze.</p><p></p><p>"Father!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression was shocked, with undisguised joy in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that the Demon-Slaying Sword left behind by Gu Qingfeng would be so powerful, directly killing a Fusion Realm cultivator, and even being able to independently suppress an evil entity.</p><p></p><p>Even though Gu Yang had always believed in Gu Qingfeng's words, witnessing it in person was still profoundly shocking.</p><p></p><p>Now.</p><p></p><p>The evil entity was struggling frantically, but the long sword remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>"What kind of divine weapon is that, able to slay Jiang Ning—"</p><p></p><p>On the side of the Divine Martial Army, Laoqiu and Cui Mingfeng's smiles had long disappeared, their eyes filled with horror as they looked towards the direction of the North Gate.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ning's strength.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, was not much inferior to theirs.</p><p></p><p>They had thought that with Jiang Ning's methods, killing Gu Yang would be an easy task.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ning hadn't even truly unleashed his strength, yet he was directly killed by a mysterious divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>"That is Gu Qingfeng's sword!"</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing said word by word.</p><p></p><p>After learning that Gu Qingfeng had destroyed the Divine Fist Sect and slain the Primal Master of the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect, Pei Jing had been diligently gathering information about him.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>The moment he saw the Demon-Slaying Sword, he recognized that it was Gu Qingfeng's sword.</p><p></p><p>His words.</p><p></p><p>Caused the expressions of the others to change again.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's sword!</p><p></p><p>The person himself hadn't even arrived, yet with just a sword, he was able to slay a Fusion Realm cultivator? One must know that Jiang Ning was no ordinary Fusion Realm cultivator, but a Fusion Realm peak expert.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength.</p><p></p><p>He was comparable to the top True Meaning Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Ning was dead.</p><p></p><p>Killed by Gu Qingfeng's sword.</p><p></p><p>To be precise.</p><p></p><p>It was Gu Qingfeng's divine sword protecting its master, directly killing Jiang Ning.</p><p></p><p>The impact of this scene was unimaginable, causing Laoqiu and Cui Mingfeng to feel a chill in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng not showing up was already so terrifying, if he were to truly appear, how dreadful would that be? Just then.</p><p></p><p>A sudden figure appeared on the North Gate, the person in azure robes, with a detached gaze, standing there with hands behind his back, exuding an aura as if a transcendent immortal had descended to the mortal realm, all the arrows shot towards him dissipating and shattering without a sound.</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's expression brightened.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng glanced at him and said indifferently, "...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Seal this evil spirit for now!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang immediately ordered someone to bring the already prepared golden coffin, and at the same time, Gu Qingfeng had a slight thought, and the Demon-Slaying Sword that was nailed to the evil spirit flew towards the latter.</p><p></p><p>Without the suppression of the Demon-Slaying Sword, the evil spirit immediately erupted.</p><p></p><p>But in the next breath.</p><p></p><p>The evil spirit was suppressed and sealed into the golden coffin by the joint efforts of Gu and the others.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing's face also looked unsightly.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Qingfeng—"</p><p></p><p>The other party had arrived.</p><p></p><p>This was within his expectations.</p><p></p><p>After all, the purpose of this trip was to suppress the White Stone Sect and eliminate the Gu Family Manor, so the appearance of the old master of the Gu Family Manor was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>But his side had three elders of the Tian Yang Sword Sect guarding, and Pei Jing was absolutely confident that he could defeat the other party.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>This self-confidence was completely shattered with the fall of Jiangning.</p><p></p><p>When he truly saw Gu Qingfeng, Pei Jing's heart unexpectedly rose with deep awe, and even a trace of fear that he himself had not noticed.</p><p></p><p>Yes.</p><p></p><p>It was fear.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's strength made this Divine Martial King feel a sense of fear.</p><p></p><p>The person had not arrived yet.</p><p></p><p>But a sword had already killed a peak Fusion Spirit Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Then how terrifying would Gu Qingfeng's true strength be?</p><p></p><p>A Grand Master? Or even higher? At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also looked at Pei Jing, the two separated by a hundred yards, but they could still make eye contact.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Martial King Pei Jing, today we finally meet!"</p><p></p><p>He spoke slowly, but his voice could override all the sounds on the battlefield and accurately reach the other party's ears.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Pei Jing suppressed the emotions in his heart and said calmly, "The reputation of the Tyrannical Sword Gu Qingfeng has long been known to me, and I have always had great respect for the old master of the Gu Family Manor.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Great Xuan Dynasty is on the verge of collapse and the heroes of the world are rising, if the old master of the Gu Family Manor is willing to cooperate with me, we may not have no chance of contending for the great position.</p><p></p><p>When the day comes that I rule the world, I will certainly not forget the contributions of the old master of the Gu Family Manor. At that time, Guangyang Prefecture and even the entire Taishan Prefecture can be the fiefdom of the Gu Family.</p><p></p><p>All the secret martial arts of the world, as long as I can produce them, can be reviewed by the old master of the Gu Family."</p><p></p><p>After witnessing Gu Qingfeng's powerful strength, Pei Jing gave up the idea of attacking the North Gate Pass.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful figure.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people could not be compared to him.</p><p></p><p>The outside world had always rumored that Gu Qingfeng was only a top-tier True Meaning Master, but now it seems that this person is clearly a true Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>It's just that this Grand Master has always been low-key, so he has misjudged the other party's strength several times.</p><p></p><p>Now.</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing's biggest idea is to do whatever it takes to bring Gu Qingfeng into his own camp.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful figure.</p><p></p><p>If he can be used, the benefits are unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Pei Jing's words, Luoqiu and Cui Mingfeng exchanged a glance, and neither of them spoke.</p><p></p><p>On the North Gate Pass.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng heard this and his expression remained indifferent: "The conditions offered by the Divine Martial King are indeed difficult to refuse, but unfortunately, Gu always only believes in the power of strength.</p><p></p><p>With the current strength of the Divine Martial King, I'm afraid he is still not qualified to make Gu submit!"</p><p></p><p>"Today, the 100,000 Divine Martial Army attacked the North Gate Pass, and the Divine Martial King even led the army in person. Let me take a look at your strength and see if it is worthy of your ambition—"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Gu Qingfeng's blood surged, and he stepped out, falling into the battlefield like a cannon shell.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Sword light was crisp.</p><p></p><p>Killing erupted.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 90</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the invitation in his hand, his brows slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>The Commanding Officer of the Black Mysterious Guard!</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was naturally no stranger to the existence of the Black Mysterious Guard.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had once captured a member of the Black Mysterious Guard and obtained from him the technique of the Golden Body Forged by a Hundred Refinements and the Seven Killing Blade.</p><p></p><p>What Gu Qingfeng found a bit puzzling was that, after he had openly confronted the Shen Wu King, the Commanding Officer of the Black Mysterious Guard would now come to his doorstep.</p><p></p><p>There must be some other implications behind this.</p><p></p><p>"Whether the visitor is up to no good, I shall see him first before deciding."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng suddenly smiled, realizing that he might have overthought the matter.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, he really did not need to worry too much. This was Guangyang Prefecture, not Danyang County. Even if Pei Jing had some other motives, he might not necessarily be able to threaten Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Qingfeng simply had his subordinates bring in Li Standing.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, a middle-aged man walked in from outside and politely cupped his hands towards Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Li Standing pays his respects to Lord Gu."</p><p></p><p>"Please have a seat," Gu Qingfeng said calmly, and the other man sat down as instructed. Gu Qingfeng then slowly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"As far as I know, I don't have much to do with the Shen Wu King. Commander Li, what advice do you have for me today?"</p><p></p><p>"I dare not presume to give any advice. I have come here on the orders of the King, to invite Lord Gu to join our Shen Wu Army!"</p><p></p><p>Li Standing did not beat around the bush, but stated it directly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Qingfeng's eyes narrowed slightly. "Previously, a member of the Black Mysterious Guard came to ask me to serve the Shen Wu King. If I did not comply, they threatened to wipe out the Gu family."</p><p></p><p>"Now that Commander Li has come in person, if I refuse, will the fate awaiting the Gu family be the same as total annihilation?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, Li Standing's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He could clearly feel a terrifying killing intent permeating the hall. If he were to utter even a single word that displeased the other party, Li Standing believed he might not be able to leave the Gu family manor alive.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Standing was the one in charge of the Black Mysterious Guard. His expression only changed slightly before quickly returning to normal, and he even revealed a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Gu, you jest. Our Shen Wu Army values heroes from all over the world and would never do anything so blatantly disregarding the ethics of the jianghu."</p><p></p><p>"The previous Black Mysterious Guard member acted on his own accord and offended Lord Gu. Today, I am here to apologize to Lord Gu on his behalf!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Li Standing started to rise to apologize.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng raised his hand to stop him. "Apologies are unnecessary. I'm sure the grass on that person's grave has grown quite long by now. I killed a member of your Black Mysterious Guard - Commander Li, are you not bothered by that?"</p><p></p><p>"That person did not understand the rules and deserved to die for offending Lord Gu. Even if Lord Gu had not personally taken action, I would not have spared him upon learning of this. </p><p></p><p>Now that Lord Gu has taken the initiative to eliminate this thorn in our side, I am deeply grateful!"</p><p></p><p>Li Standing lowered his posture to an extreme degree, his face full of smiles, without a trace of unnaturalness or resentment.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the smile on Gu Qingfeng's face disappeared, and he looked at Li Standing deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Commander Li is indeed able to bend and yield. But alas, I have no interest in getting involved in the turmoil of this chaotic world. I established the Gu Family Manor only in the hope of having a place to call home.</p><p></p><p>So I'm afraid I must disappoint the Shen Wu King's kind offer."</p><p></p><p>"Lord Gu has not even heard the conditions of our Shen Wu Army yet. Why the hasty refusal?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Zuo Li had already anticipated Gu Qingfeng's refusal, so as soon as the other party's words fell, he immediately continued speaking.</p><p></p><p>"The King's decree is that as long as Master Gu is willing to join the Divine Martial Army, all the secret martial arts scriptures can be provided, even the supreme martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"You must know that the high-level martial arts in the world are all under the control of various aristocratic families and sects. For other cultivators to learn advanced martial arts is extremely difficult!"</p><p></p><p>"As for the supreme martial arts, even less need be said. Such martial arts are scarce in the world."</p><p></p><p>"But the King values Master Gu greatly. As long as Master Gu agrees, the supreme martial arts will definitely be presented to him with both hands."</p><p></p><p>"Even if Master Gu's martial dao reaches its limit in the future, the King can also provide Master Gu with the most top-notch secret techniques for refining evil into one's body, allowing Master Gu to have the hope of glimpsing the mysteries of eternal life and immortality."</p><p></p><p>After finishing speaking.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Li quietly waited for Gu Qingfeng's response.</p><p></p><p>He believed.</p><p></p><p>That with such conditions, no one would be able to refuse.</p><p></p><p>Supreme martial arts!</p><p></p><p>The most top-notch secret techniques for refining evil into one's body!</p><p></p><p>Any of these would be an opportunity that is hard to come by in the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>Even Gu Qingfeng, upon hearing such conditions, was slightly stunned, somewhat unexpectedly impressed by Pei Jing's generosity.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, he still resolutely shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"It's still the same, Gu has no desire to participate in the world's turmoil, and has once again disappointed the Divine Martial King!"</p><p></p><p>These words.</p><p></p><p>Caused the smile on Zuo Li's face to fade a bit.</p><p></p><p>"Why must Master Gu refuse? The great trend of the world has gone through a cycle of three thousand years. The previous dynasty ruled the world for three thousand six hundred years, but eventually its fortune was exhausted, and the heroes of the world rose up, finally breaking through the siege and ascending the great throne, establishing the nation of Taixuan."</p><p></p><p>"And from the establishment of the Taixuan dynasty to the present, there have also been three thousand years."</p><p></p><p>"Now the fortune of the Taixuan dynasty is nearing its end, and the heroes of the world are rising up again, and the turbulent tide of chaos will surely sweep across the world."</p><p></p><p>"And in such a situation, where is there true peace?"</p><p></p><p>"My lord is a man of heavenly mandate, and in just over a decade, he has already brought three prefectures under his control, a strength that is unparalleled among the warlords and princes of the world."</p><p></p><p>"More importantly, my lord has the support of the Tianyang Sword Sect, an ancient and truly immortal sect."</p><p></p><p>"As long as Master Gu is willing to serve my lord, when my lord eventually dominates the world, he will certainly not forget Master Gu's contributions. At that time, Master Gu can easily use this advantage to establish a thousand-year-old aristocratic family and sect."</p><p></p><p>"Even further, there is a chance of becoming an immortal sect and family!"</p><p></p><p>Zuo Li persuaded earnestly, stating the pros and cons, only to try to recruit Gu Qingfeng into the Divine Martial Army.</p><p></p><p>After all, the other party's strength was worthy of his such effort.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's heart was firm, and he still refused in stern words.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Li sighed inwardly, his face revealing a wry smile: "Well, since Master Gu has not yet decided, I shall not continue to force the matter."</p><p></p><p>"When the peace of Taishan Prefecture is shattered, and the thirty-six prefectures of the nine states are completely engulfed in the flames of war, Master Gu will naturally understand the great difficulty of remaining aloof in such a chaotic world."</p><p></p><p>"This is the token of our Divine Martial Army. If Master Gu changes his mind in the future, you can send someone to the Divine Martial Army with this token, and they will certainly not disappoint you."</p><p></p><p>"That is all I have to say!"</p><p></p><p>"I shall take my leave now!"</p><p></p><p>Zuo Li stood up, left behind a token of the Divine Martial Army, and then turned and left without any delay.</p>

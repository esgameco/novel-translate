        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The people in Linxian County were hurrying about, most of them wearing thick cotton coats. Occasionally, there would be someone dressed lightly, shivering like sifted flour in the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>But in a certain courtyard, there was a young man dressed lightly, practicing punches in the wind and snow. Each punch was fierce and powerful, with wisps of white vapor seemingly rising from the top of his head - it was quite mysterious.</p><p></p><p>After a long while.</p><p></p><p>After finishing a set of punches, the young man's mind stirred, and his gaze seemed to have an extra line of text that others couldn't see.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng  Age: 22/80  Realm: Beginner Leather Refining</p><p></p><p>Martial Arts: Collapse Mountain Fist (Beginner) --</p><p></p><p>"To make the Collapse Mountain Fist reach the minor success stage, it seems it won't be accomplished in a short time!" </p><p></p><p>The young man shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>His name was Gu Qingfeng. Before the age of sixteen, he was no different from ordinary people. But after turning sixteen, he suddenly awakened the wisdom of his past life, gaining a memory of an additional lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Upon realizing this was a world in chaos, with the collapse of rituals and music, Gu Qingfeng understood that strength was the foundation for one's standing in this world.</p><p></p><p>So, he did not hesitate to exhaust his family's meager resources to successfully enter a martial arts school and become a disciple, learning a technique called the Collapse Mountain Fist.</p><p></p><p>This martial art, although only a beginner-level skill, was sufficient for Gu Qingfeng's temporary needs.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Gu Qingfeng's natural talent was average. After spending several years in the martial arts school, he still could not master the Collapse Mountain Fist. Later, due to being unable to pay the continued tuition fees, he had to leave the school. After wandering around, he eventually settled down in Linxian County.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until a year ago that Gu Qingfeng finally managed to learn the Collapse Mountain Fist to the beginner level.</p><p></p><p>And with the moment he mastered the Collapse Mountain Fist, he discovered that the "golden finger" he had obtained from his transmigration had also appeared.</p><p></p><p>A simple attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing else beyond that.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had researched it many times, but found no additional functions for the attribute panel, as if it were just a simple display panel.</p><p></p><p>Over time, Gu Qingfeng gave up on this idea.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the attribute panel that had remained unchanged for a long time suddenly had an additional line of small text.</p><p></p><p>"Your first offspring has been born (can only be triggered once)!"</p><p>"Reward: 1 Upgrade Point!"</p><p>"Reward: 10 Qi Blood Pills!"</p><p></p><p>The sudden change left Gu Qingfeng slightly stunned, as if he had witnessed something incredible.</p><p></p><p>The attribute panel now had two interfaces.</p><p></p><p>One interface displayed the just-received notification, and the other was his original attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>The difference was that the attribute panel now had some changes compared to before.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng  Age: 22/80  Realm: Beginner Leather Refining</p><p>Martial Arts: Collapse Mountain Fist (Minor Success) Upgrade Points: 1 --</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng's gaze fell on the Upgrade Points, information naturally surfaced in his mind, allowing him to understand the function of Upgrade Points.</p><p></p><p>Upgrade Points! As the name suggests, they are used to upgrade martial arts realms.</p><p></p><p>With this realization, Gu Qingfeng tried to use the Upgrade Point on the Collapse Mountain Fist.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the Collapse Mountain Fist advanced from the Beginner stage to the Minor Success stage.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, a powerful surge of blood energy and strength erupted from Gu Qingfeng's body, and his skin became even more resilient, as if he had undergone a tremendous transformation.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the memories related to the Minor Success stage of the Collapse Mountain Fist suddenly emerged, like a series of vivid images.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A scene appeared in Gu Qingfeng's mind, as if he had cultivated it countless times before.</p><p></p><p>When he looked at his own attribute panel, Gu Qingfeng found that his realm had directly broken through from the initial stage of skin refining to the intermediate stage.</p><p></p><p>"I've broken through!"</p><p></p><p>He was delighted.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that Gu Qingfeng truly discovered the true wondrous use of his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>He had painstakingly cultivated the Collapse Mountain Fist for many years, barely entering the introductory stage, but now with just a few points of improvement, he had broken through from the introductory stage to the minor success stage, and his realm had also risen to the intermediate stage of skin refining.</p><p></p><p>In a small place like Linxian County, being at the intermediate stage of skin refining was already quite formidable.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng further discovered that there was an item bag below the attribute panel, and the rewarded Blood Qi Pill was clearly listed there.</p><p></p><p>With just a thought, a blue bottle appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng quickly grabbed the bottle, pulled out the stopper, and a rich fragrance wafted out, revealing the corresponding medicinal pill inside the bottle.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Qi Pill! Consuming it can enhance the cultivator's blood qi and assist in their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had heard of such medicinal pills when he was in the martial arts hall, but he had never truly experienced them before.</p><p></p><p>After putting away the medicinal pill, Gu Qingfeng continued to study his golden finger.</p><p></p><p>From the prompts in the information panel and the changes in himself, he could confirm one thing - his golden finger seemed to be related to his descendant bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"The most urgent task is to find my adopted son!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered.</p><p></p><p>Finding his son was not difficult, as he had only broken through once in this world, and the other party was not from Linxian County, but this was not a problem.</p><p></p><p>After a simple cleanup, Gu Qingfeng shouldered his backpack and left the courtyard he had rented for a long time.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ten days later,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng returned to Linxian County, but this time he was carrying a baby in his arms.</p><p></p><p>During these ten days,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had traveled thousands of miles and arduously found his offspring, only to discover that the child's mother had already died in childbirth. There were only an elderly couple left, who were planning to abandon the infant, and that was when he found them.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the woman's passing,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was also somewhat saddened.</p><p></p><p>Although they had little emotional connection, and their relationship was due to some accident, upon hearing the news of her death, he still could not remain calm in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After giving most of the few silver taels he had to the elderly couple, Gu Qingfeng took the child and left.</p><p></p><p>This was a baby boy.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng named him Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>After bringing him back to Linxian County, Gu Qingfeng began to worry about how to raise the infant.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had never had the experience of raising a child, and in his two lifetimes, this was the first time he had his own offspring.</p><p></p><p>There was another problem.</p><p></p><p>That was, his silver taels were already almost depleted.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't solve the silver problem, not only could he not raise the child, he might even starve to death himself.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took a deep breath, as if he had made some decision, and holding the child, he went out again.</p><p></p><p>But this time,</p><p></p><p>he came to the front of a martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>"I am Gu Qingfeng, and I would like to ask if the hall is recruiting disciples?"</p><p></p><p>"Disciples?"</p><p></p><p>The martial arts hall personnel looked at the young man with a scrutinizing gaze, especially when they saw him holding a child, their expression became even more strange.</p><p></p><p>"Of course there's no problem with becoming a disciple of the martial arts hall, but there's one requirement - your cultivation must be at least at the intermediate stage of skin refining!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this,</p><p></p><p>a confident expression appeared on Gu Qingfeng's face.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

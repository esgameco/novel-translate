        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The people in Linxian County were hurrying about, most of them wearing thick cotton jackets. Occasionally, there would be someone dressed lightly, shivering like sifted flour in the wind and snow.</p><p></p><p>In a certain courtyard, there was a young man dressed lightly, practicing punches in the wind and snow. Each punch was fierce and powerful, with wisps of white vapor seemingly rising from the top of his head - it was quite mysterious.</p><p></p><p>After a long while.</p><p></p><p>After finishing a set of punches, the young man's spirit stirred, and his gaze seemed to have an extra line of text that others couldn't see.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng, Age: 22/80, Realm: Beginner Leather Refining</p><p></p><p>Martial Arts: Collapse Mountain Fist (Beginner) --</p><p></p><p>"To make the Collapse Mountain Fist reach the initial mastery, it seems it won't be accomplished in a short time!" </p><p></p><p>The young man shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>His name was Gu Qingfeng. Before the age of sixteen, he was no different from ordinary people. After turning sixteen, he suddenly awakened the wisdom of his past life, gaining a memory of an additional lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Upon realizing this was a world in chaos, with the collapse of rituals and music, Gu Qingfeng understood that strength was the foundation for his survival in this world.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he did not hesitate to exhaust his family's meager resources to successfully enter a martial arts school and become a disciple, learning a technique called the Collapse Mountain Fist.</p><p></p><p>Although this martial art was only a beginner-level skill, it was sufficient for Gu Qingfeng's temporary needs.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Gu Qingfeng's natural talent was average. After spending several years in the martial arts school, he still could not master the Collapse Mountain Fist. Later, due to his inability to pay the continued tuition fees, he had to leave the school. After wandering around, he eventually settled down in Linxian County.</p><p></p><p>It was not until a year ago that Gu Qingfeng finally managed to master the Collapse Mountain Fist.</p><p></p><p>And with the mastery of the Collapse Mountain Fist, he discovered that the "cheat" that had come with his transmigration also appeared.</p><p></p><p>A simple attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing else beyond that.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had researched it many times, but found no additional functions for the attribute panel, as if it were just a simple display.</p><p></p><p>Over time, Gu Qingfeng gave up on this idea.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the attribute panel, which had remained unchanged for a long time, suddenly had an additional line of text.</p><p></p><p>"Your first offspring has been born (can only be triggered once)!"</p><p>"Reward: 1 Upgrade Point!"</p><p>"Reward: 10 Qi Blood Pills!"</p><p></p><p>The sudden change left Gu Qingfeng stunned, as if he had witnessed something unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>The current attribute panel had now split into two interfaces.</p><p></p><p>One interface displayed the just-received notification, and the other was his original attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>The difference was that the attribute panel now had some changes compared to before.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng, Age: 22/80, Realm: Beginner Leather Refining</p><p>Martial Arts: Collapse Mountain Fist (Initial Mastery), Upgrade Points: 1 --</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng's gaze fell on the Upgrade Points, information naturally surfaced in his mind, allowing him to understand the function of the Upgrade Points.</p><p></p><p>Upgrade Points! As the name suggests, they are used to upgrade martial arts realms.</p><p></p><p>With this realization, Gu Qingfeng tried to use the Upgrade Point on the Collapse Mountain Fist.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the Collapse Mountain Fist advanced from the Beginner realm to the Initial Mastery realm.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, a surge of powerful blood energy erupted from Gu Qingfeng's body, and his skin became even more resilient, as if he had undergone a tremendous transformation.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the memories related to the Initial Mastery of the Collapse Mountain Fist suddenly emerged, like a series of vivid images.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A scene appeared in Gu Qingfeng's mind, as if he had cultivated it countless times before.</p><p></p><p>When he looked at his own attribute panel again, Gu Qingfeng found that his realm had directly broken through from the initial stage of skin refining to the intermediate stage of skin refining.</p><p></p><p>"I've broken through!"</p><p></p><p>He was delighted.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that Gu Qingfeng truly discovered the true wonder of his own attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>He had arduously cultivated the Collapse Mountain Fist for years, barely entering the introductory stage, but now, with just a few points of improvement, he had broken through from the introductory stage to the minor success stage, and his realm had also risen to the intermediate stage of skin refining.</p><p></p><p>In a small place like Linxian County, being at the intermediate stage of skin refining was already quite formidable.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng further discovered that below the attribute panel, there was also an item column, in which a reward of a blood-replenishing pill was clearly listed.</p><p></p><p>With just a thought, a blue bottle appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng quickly grabbed the bottle, pulled out the stopper, and a rich fragrance wafted out, revealing the corresponding medicinal pill inside the bottle.</p><p></p><p>The Blood-Replenishing Pill! Consuming it can enhance a warrior's blood qi and assist their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had heard of such pills before when he was at the martial arts hall, but he had never truly experienced them.</p><p></p><p>After putting away the pill, Gu Qingfeng continued to study his golden finger.</p><p></p><p>From the prompts in the information panel and the changes in himself, he could confirm one thing - his golden finger seemed to be related to his descendant bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"The most urgent task is to find my adopted son!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered.</p><p></p><p>Finding his son was not difficult, as he had only broken through once in this world, and the other party was not from Linxian County, but this was not a problem.</p><p></p><p>After a simple cleanup, Gu Qingfeng shouldered his backpack and left the courtyard he had rented for a long time.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ten days later, Gu Qingfeng returned to Linxian County, but this time, he was carrying a baby in his arms.</p><p></p><p>During these ten days, Gu Qingfeng had traveled through countless mountains and rivers, and when he finally found his offspring, he discovered that the child's mother had already died in childbirth. Only an elderly couple remained, who were planning to abandon the infant, as they lacked the ability to raise the child. That was when Gu Qingfeng found them.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the woman's passing, Gu Qingfeng felt somewhat saddened. Although they had little emotional connection, and their relationship was due to some unexpected circumstances, upon hearing the news of her death, he still could not remain calm within.</p><p></p><p>After giving most of the few silver taels he had to the elderly couple, Gu Qingfeng left with the child.</p><p></p><p>This was a baby boy. Gu Qingfeng named him Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>After bringing him back to Linxian County, Gu Qingfeng began to worry about how to raise the infant. After all, he had never had any experience in raising children, and this was the first time he had his own descendant.</p><p></p><p>There was another problem - his silver taels were now almost depleted.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't solve the issue of money, not only would he be unable to care for the child, he might even starve himself.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Gu Qingfeng took a deep breath, as if he had made some decision, and holding the child, he went out again.</p><p></p><p>But this time, he went to a martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>"I am Gu Qingfeng, and I would like to inquire if the hall is recruiting instructors?"</p><p></p><p>"Instructors?"</p><p></p><p>The martial arts hall personnel eyed the young man with a scrutinizing gaze, especially when they saw him holding a child, their expression becoming even more peculiar.</p><p></p><p>"There's no problem with you becoming a martial arts hall instructor, but there's one requirement - your cultivation must be at least at the intermediate stage of skin refining!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, a confident expression appeared on Gu Qingfeng's face.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 165</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere in the entire sect's main hall was now heavily suppressed.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder of the Taisuzu Sect, Master Taixuan, who had previously been lofty and high-above, now had a gloomy and unsightly expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"The evil spirits are prohibited from entering Guangyang Prefecture... and they even forbid all practitioners from entering Guangyang Prefecture. This person is truly audacious!!"</p><p></p><p>Master Taixuan's voice was ice-cold.</p><p></p><p>In the battle of Guangyang Prefecture, the other sects may have been fine, but the Taisuzu Sect not only lost a batch of disciples, but also sacrificed a half-step Nascent Soul Realm elder.</p><p></p><p>Such actions, in Master Taixuan's view, were a direct slap in the face of the Taisuzu Sect.</p><p></p><p>If it had been in the past, Master Taixuan would not have swallowed this resentment.</p><p></p><p>But nowâ€”</p><p></p><p>Although Master Taixuan's heart was filled with fury, he did not directly order an attack on Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>After all, a terrifying expert who was rumored to be on par with the Martial Ancestor was not that simple to deal with.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the one from Guangyang Prefecture even slew the evil spirit that was the legacy of the Ancient Celestial Sustainer, breaking the legend that evil spirits cannot be killed. If this person is truly capable of doing this, our status may also be affected!"</p><p></p><p>A Taisuzu Sect elder spoke with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>The reason why practitioners could grow stronger was not only because of their long lifespans, but also because warriors found it difficult to deal with evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>If warriors gained the ability to resolve evil spirits, the significance of the existence of practitioners would naturally be impacted.</p><p></p><p>Master Taixuan's expression now became indifferent: "What all people in the world pursue is nothing more than longevity and longevity. Even if one is on par with the Martial Ancestor, their lifespan is only about two thousand years at most."</p><p></p><p>"Those who reach the Fusion Spirit Realm can live for 1,500 years, those in the Nascent Soul Realm can live for 3,000 years, and if one can break through to the Divinity Realm, they can even live for 5,000 years!"</p><p></p><p>"It is rumored that above the Divinity Realm, there exists the true secret of eternal and immortal life."</p><p></p><p>"Relying on this, warriors can never shake the status of practitioners!"</p><p></p><p>Master Taixuan was well aware that the growth of practitioners was not truly because many people cared about the common people and wished to refine evil spirits into their bodies to devour the demonic.</p><p></p><p>The fundamental reason for the rise of practitioners was the two words "longevity".</p><p></p><p>Although it was said that since the appearance of practitioners, the strongest have been those in the Divinity Realm.</p><p></p><p>The so-called eternal and immortal life only existed in rumors.</p><p></p><p>But still, rumors are rumors, and there is always a chance.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, the deficiency of warriors in terms of lifespan is a well-known fact.</p><p></p><p>"Now, the Supreme Elder has been in seclusion for hundreds of years, striving to break through to the Divinity Realm. As long as the Supreme Elder succeeds, ordinary warriors are insignificant!"</p><p></p><p>"Even if one is on par with the Martial Ancestor, once they step into the realm of the Divinity Realm, they will be able to dominate the world."</p><p></p><p>"In the past, when the Divinity Realm Ancestor of the Ji Clan was still alive, his aura pressed down on the Nine Provinces. It was not until that Ancestor ascended that other sects and families could finally catch their breath."</p><p></p><p>"Now, as long as we wait for the Supreme Elder to break through, our Taisuzu Sect will be the second Ji Clan!"</p><p></p><p>Master Taixuan's gaze became heated. This matter was the secret of the Taisuzu Sect, known only to the sect's high-level elders.</p><p></p><p>That Supreme Elder had already reached the half-step Divinity Realm and had been in seclusion all this time. The outside world had rumored that he had already ascended, but that was not the case.</p><p></p><p>After all, such matters, if leaked, would undoubtedly make the Taisuzu Sect a target of other forces.</p><p></p><p>When the Ji Clan produced a Divinity Realm Ancestor in the past, it allowed the Ji Clan to dominate the world for five thousand years. The various immortal sects and families did not wish to see such a situation again.</p><p></p><p>So, if news of a powerful cultivator in the Taisuzu Sect secretly striving for the Divinity Realm were to spread, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>At that time, even if the Taisuzu Sect was an immortal sect, it might not be able to withstand such suppression.</p><p></p><p>But as long as the Supreme Elder could break through, the Taisuzu Sect...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zu Zong, the true patriarch of the Suzong Sect, had already broken through to the Tong Shen Realm. Therefore, all the problems were no longer a big deal to him.</p><p></p><p>What Domineering Blade? What Immortal Sect Families? In the face of the Tong Shen Realm patriarch, they were all insignificant.</p><p></p><p>"As for the matters in Qing Yun State, I, the Suzong Sect, will not intervene for now. If the other sects cannot sit still, let them go and test the depth of that person's abilities!"</p><p></p><p>Grand Master Taixuan suppressed all the thoughts in his heart and looked at the other sect elders, speaking up.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, the other elders naturally had no objections.</p><p></p><p>It is true that the Suzong Sect had lost face this time, but in the face of the sect's foundation and their own lives, what is a mere loss of face?</p><p></p><p>After all, if they were to make a move against that person from Guangyang Prefecture, then who in this group would be a suitable candidate? Including Grand Master Taixuan himself, they all feared that they would not be a match for that Domineering Blade.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yuetian had already sacrificed his life to tell the world how terrifying that person's strength was.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Central State, in the imperial palace, in the Emperor's study, the Emperor of the Taixuan Dynasty, Ji Chunqiu, was sitting on the dragon throne, his appearance aged and exuding a sense of decline.</p><p></p><p>Before him was a memorial from Qing Yun State, the content of which was related to Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"Domineering Blade Gu Qingfeng! He slew the sect master of the Tianyang Sword Sect, Gu Yuetian, with a single sword strike. His cultivation has reached the Tong Shen Realm, possibly rivaling the Martial Ancestor from a millennium ago!"</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, this person also possesses the means to eliminate evil spirits."</p><p></p><p>After reading the memorial for a long time, Ji Chunqiu let out a long sigh and handed it to the other members of the imperial family sitting in the study.</p><p></p><p>They took turns reading the memorial, and their expressions changed accordingly.</p><p></p><p>"Father, is this news truly real?" asked the Crown Prince, Ji Zhen'an.</p><p></p><p>Ji Chunqiu replied indifferently, "This news should be true. In the past, that Martial Ancestor preached to the world, and it was said that he had broken through the limits of the Grand Masters. However, since the Martial Ancestor's passing, there has been no one in the world who could reach that level of strength again."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect Guangyang Prefecture to produce such a powerful figure!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Chunqiu's tone carried a hint of emotion.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ji Zhen'an cautiously asked, "Father, are you planning to try to win over this person?"</p><p></p><p>"Correct!" Ji Chunqiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Although our Taixuan Dynasty is founded by the Ji family, the cycle of the kingdom has been turning for three thousand years, a fate that no one can resist. The previous dynasty managed to last for six hundred years through its own foundations, but in the end, it could not escape its demise."</p><p></p><p>"Now, the warlords are vying for control of the Central State, wanting to destroy the foundation of our Taixuan Dynasty. If the dynasty falls, you all will have no chance of survival!"</p><p></p><p>This was a cruel truth, but it was the reality they faced.</p><p></p><p>The founding emperor of the Taixuan Dynasty was actually from a branch of the Ji family, and it was with the support of the Ji family that he was able to conquer the world and establish the Taixuan Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, the Taixuan Dynasty has been constantly providing resources to the Ji family.</p><p></p><p>But now that the three-thousand-year cycle is about to end, the Ji family no longer protects the Taixuan Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Without the protection of the Immortal Sect Families, the downfall of the Taixuan Dynasty is imminent.</p><p></p><p>Faced with this, Ji Chunqiu was unwilling to accept it.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 147</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, it is just so plain and unadorned! There is no so-called great strategy to speak of, after all, in this world where the strong are revered, strength is the root of everything.</p><p></p><p>When the high-level officers of a large army are all assassinated and turned against, then how much resistance capability would the army have left?</p><p></p><p>This is the logic.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang understood this.</p><p></p><p>So, </p><p></p><p>To prevent others from imitating his actions, Gu Yang would not dispatch all his bodyguards, but would at least leave one or two Xiantian Sect Masters to guard him, to prevent any problems from arising.</p><p></p><p>With two perfected Xiantian Sect Masters guarding him, as long as it's not a Grand Sect Master or a top-tier Zhenyi Sect Master taking action, there would basically be no major issues.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang not only has Sect Masters protecting him, but he also now has hundreds of thousands of troops under his command.</p><p></p><p>In this way,</p><p></p><p>As long as the opponent cannot land a decisive blow, once they are surrounded by the large army, they will most likely meet their demise.</p><p></p><p>Do not be fooled by the fact that Gu Yang's forces have not developed for many years, and he has not even occupied a single prefecture - in terms of innate strength and power, he is destined to be stronger than many other forces.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>The bodyguards did not take too long to retrieve the items.</p><p></p><p>After Gu Qingfeng threw the golden coffin containing the evil entity into the Demon-Subduing Prison, he directly released the evil entity and suppressed and slew it with absolute strength.</p><p></p><p>These things, if left alone, would only bring calamity, so Gu Qingfeng naturally could not leave them be.</p><p></p><p>Then,</p><p></p><p>There were the martial arts of the Crimson Flame Sect, as well as a special cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>"The True Scriptures of the Heavenly Veins!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems this is the mysterious inheritance that Yang'er has obtained."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Veins in his hand, and he also noticed that the material on which the martial arts were recorded was rather special. He tried to tear it slightly, but found that the secret manual did not budge at all.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression became increasingly astonished.</p><p></p><p>One must know that at his level of cultivation, even a single finger could unleash a mighty force, and even the so-called peerless divine weapons would likely not be able to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>This power could not even affect the paper in the slightest, revealing the extraordinary nature of this secret manual.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's gaze fell upon the content of the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Veins.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour passed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng regained his senses.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, there was one-third astonishment and seven-tenths doubt.</p><p></p><p>"By condensing nine Heavenly Veins, one can amplify one's own battle prowess by nine times!"</p><p></p><p>"Can there truly be such an extraordinary cultivation method in this world?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was somewhat disbelieving.</p><p></p><p>He, like Gu Yang, had some doubts about the authenticity of the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Veins.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng looked at his own attribute panel, he was stunned.</p><p></p><p>There, a line of text had clearly appeared.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p>True Scriptures of the Heavenly Veins (Unlearned)!...</p><p></p><p>"This cultivation method is indeed real!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression changed again.</p><p></p><p>Since it could be recorded on the attribute panel, it meant that the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Veins was real.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p></p><p>The attribute panel is a method to verify the authenticity of martial arts and cultivation methods. If a martial art or cultivation method was fabricated, it would not be recorded on the attribute panel, and vice versa.</p><p></p><p>With this thought in mind,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng tried to cultivate the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Veins.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>The True Scriptures of the Heavenly Veins did not budge at all.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng also understood the true reason why the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Veins was difficult to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>"The first layer..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It requires a hundred Advancement Points to advance, even Martial Arts Grandmasters only need fifty Advancement Points. Could it be that the Heavenly Meridian True Classic's level is comparable to that of the Martial Arts Grandmasters?"</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, Gu Qingfeng felt it was normal.</p><p></p><p>If the Heavenly Meridian True Classic was real, then the powerful expert who created this martial art must not be simple. To be called a Martial Arts Grandmaster would not be an exaggeration.</p><p></p><p>However, a hundred Advancement Points. </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng currently did not have that many.</p><p></p><p>After all, he only had a mere thirteen Advancement Points at the moment.</p><p></p><p>To obtain more Advancement Points, it would either require Gu Yang and the others to make a breakthrough in their cultivation, or for the other party to achieve some kind of accomplishment.</p><p></p><p>But triggering accomplishments is difficult, and so far, Gu Yang has only triggered a couple.</p><p></p><p>As for the former, it would be much easier.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Yang and Gu Xuan are in a state of realm completion. The former can advance to the Refining Bone Realm, while the latter can advance to the Refining Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for Gu Shengnan, she is still too young.</p><p></p><p>"However, Yangér should leave behind more descendants now. Otherwise, when his cultivation progresses further, it will not be as easy to leave behind descendants."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng pondered.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's current situation is much better than Gu Qingfeng's back then.</p><p></p><p>After all, at that time, Gu Qingfeng did not have any supporting forces behind him, and he had to single-handedly support the entire Gu family, so he had to be very careful. Bringing a family along was indeed not the best strategy.</p><p></p><p>But now it's different.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang has the entire Gu Manor behind him, and he also has Gu Qingfeng, who is comparable to a Martial Arts Grandmaster, as his father. So the problem of leaving behind descendants will be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Gu Qingfeng summoned Gu Peng.</p><p></p><p>"Your subordinate pays respects to the Manor Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Convey my message to Yangér, let him have the opportunity to leave behind more descendants to strengthen the Gu family bloodline."</p><p></p><p>"...Understood, I will carry out your orders!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng was taken aback, completely not expecting Gu Qingfeng to summon him for this purpose.</p><p></p><p>After a brief moment of hesitation, Gu Peng respectfully withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Whatever Gu Qingfeng said, he would do.</p><p></p><p>Gu Peng was clear about his own position and status.</p><p></p><p>After Gu Peng left, Gu Qingfeng turned his gaze to the many martial arts of the Crimson Flame Sect.</p><p></p><p>Esoteric techniques for refining evil, top-tier martial arts!</p><p></p><p>It must be said that the Crimson Flame Sect, being a thousand-year-old sect, is indeed extraordinary, even if it only shows its might within the Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts here, although lacking in Grandmaster-level techniques, are abundant in terms of refining the internal organs and other advanced levels of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Gu Qingfeng began to study these martial arts, and from the insights left by previous generations, he could feel the profundity, which would help him further advance on the path of perfecting the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' defeated the Imperial Army, causing a sensation!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' conquered five cities in three days, greatly increasing his forces!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Xuan' has made some breakthroughs in his martial arts cultivation, with his strength slightly improving!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Shengnan' has cleansed her root foundation, with her aptitude slightly increasing!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' slew 697 Refining Skin Realm cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' defeated the remnants of the Divine Martial Army, killing many enemies!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' slew 1786 members of the Divine Martial Army!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Whetstone Hall, during his free time in seclusion, Gu Qingfeng looked at the information panel that constantly updated, his brows slightly raised.</p><p></p><p>From the information on the panel, it seems Gu Yang has killed quite a few people recently.</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 229</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to come here and cause trouble? Do you not fear the punishment of the court!!" </p><p></p><p>Su Guangdao shouted angrily.</p><p></p><p>He was the county magistrate responsible for managing this city. When he saw the appearance of the Blood Cloud, he naturally felt uneasy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, </p><p></p><p>despite his unease,</p><p></p><p>Su Guangdao did not show any fear.</p><p></p><p>As his words fell, a blood-robed figure suddenly appeared in the void, revealing a middle-aged face with an evil smile.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, for you all to serve as the nourishment for my Blood Banner is the greatest honor of my life. A mere dynasty dares to threaten me? Have you never heard of the name of the Blood Cloud Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Cloud Ancestor sneered contemptuously, his gaze full of disdain towards Su Guangdao.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator at the Refining Impurity Fifth Realm was nothing but an ant in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Under his spiritual perception, there were quite a few cultivators in this county, but the highest cultivation was only at the Refining Impurity Realm. Such cultivators were mere insects to the Blood Cloud Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>some cultivators outside of Xing'an County had their expressions change slightly upon hearing this and seeing the Blood Cloud in the void.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Cloud Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>"So he has come as well!"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, I didn't expect this celestial anomaly to attract him over. I'm afraid many will die now..."</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators spoke of the Blood Cloud Ancestor with great trepidation, as if he was a terrifying existence.</p><p></p><p>On the other side,</p><p></p><p>Fu He and Gu Xuan had also arrived here.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the discussions about the Blood Cloud Ancestor and the other cultivators, Gu Xuan couldn't help but turn his head and ask.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable master, who is this Blood Cloud Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Cloud Ancestor is a wandering cultivator from the Eastern Domain. His infamous reputation precedes him, rumored to have already reached the third level of the Dao Palace Realm, with a cultivation that is truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, his methods are extremely cruel. He cultivates a technique called the Blood Cloud Demonic Skill, often massacring ordinary cultivators, earning him the hatred of the world.</p><p></p><p>A sacred place once dispatched several Dao Palace Realm experts to surround and kill the Blood Cloud Ancestor, but they were all easily escaped by him.</p><p></p><p>With his appearance here, I'm afraid the people of this county will not be able to avoid calamity!"</p><p></p><p>Fu He looked at the Xing'an County now covered by the Blood Cloud, shaking his head slightly, as if he had already foreseen the fate of these common people.</p><p></p><p>It was not surprising that Fu He thought so.</p><p></p><p>After all, any Dao Palace Realm expert was an extremely terrifying existence, let alone the Blood Cloud Ancestor who had already reached the third level of the Dao Palace Realm, far surpassing ordinary Dao Palace cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan's expression became somewhat unsightly.</p><p></p><p>The world was now the domain of the Gu Clan. With the Blood Cloud Ancestor wanting to massacre the subjects of the court, it was a direct affront to the Gu Clan's face.</p><p></p><p>For a moment,</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan wanted to forcibly intervene.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Fu He saw through his thoughts and directly stopped him.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Cloud Ancestor's strength is not simple, and he acts without any restraint. If you don't take action, as a disciple of the Taixu Sacred Land, he may still have some scruples. But if you provoke him, even the Taixu Sacred Land may not be able to protect you!"</p><p></p><p>Fu He said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"You must know that once you die, you will not be able to come back to life, no matter how the Taixu Sacred Land avenges you by slaying the Blood Cloud Ancestor. The principle I've taught you is to preserve the green mountains when there is no shortage of firewood."</p><p></p><p>Any genius was a proud and arrogant person.</p><p></p><p>This, Fu He understood well.</p><p></p><p>But in Fu He's view, one must know when to yield. Throughout history, many experts had reached the peak step-by-step in this way.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Gu Xuan clenched his fists, his gaze towards the Blood Cloud Ancestor filled with killing intent, but he was helpless.</p><p></p><p>Just as Fu He said, with his current strength, going against the Blood Cloud Ancestor would be like a futile attempt, completely useless.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>the Blood Cloud Ancestor seemed to have sensed something, and his cold gaze fell on Gu Xuan, his expression becoming ferocious.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, you seem to have some dissatisfaction with me?"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, a terrifying aura immediately pressed down towards Gu Xuan. At this time, Fu He stepped forward, blocking in front of Gu Xuan, cupping his hands towards the Blood Cloud Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Cloud Senior, do not be angry. The young one is ignorant, and I hope you can give my Taixu Sacred Land some face!"</p><p></p><p>"Taixu Sacred Land... Haha!" </p><p></p><p>The Blood Cloud Ancestor's gaze towards Fu He slightly flickered, as if there was a cold killing intent, but then he seemed to have thought of something and finally withdrew his gaze.</p><p></p><p>A Manifestation Realm Ninth Level Fu He, he did not take seriously.</p><p></p><p>But the Taixu Sacred Land behind him, the Blood Cloud Ancestor had to give some face to.</p><p></p><p>He had survived until now precisely because he understood what he could offend and what he could not.</p><p></p><p>As fellow sacred lands, the Taixu Sacred Land was also one of the top powers in the Eastern Domain.</p><p></p><p>After all, not all sacred lands were on the same level.</p><p></p><p>Some sacred lands had only saints guarding them, while others had produced Great Saints or even stronger existences in the past.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>the other cultivators who heard Fu He's words also looked at him with some trepidation.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect the people of the Taixu Sacred Land to have come as well!"</p><p></p><p>"Three thousand years ago, the Taixu Sacred Land had produced a Great Saint-level expert, shaking the entire Eastern Domain. The foundation of such a power is truly unfathomable..."</p><p></p><p>The Taixu Sacred Land had an ancient heritage, with saints emerging in almost every era. Three thousand years ago, the Taixu Sacred Land had even produced a top-tier Great Saint, demonstrating its formidable strength.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the words of the other cultivators, Gu Xuan finally truly understood the status of the Taixu Sacred Land in the Eastern Domain.</p><p></p><p>On the other side,</p><p></p><p>the Blood Cloud Ancestor's cold gaze fell on Xing'an County, and his terrifying power suddenly descended, intending to refine all the people of the city.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Blood Cloud Ancestor about to act, Su Guangdao's expression changed, and he immediately unleashed his official seal, causing a powerful aura to erupt and form a blue barrier to protect the entire Xing'an County.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the meager aura of a dynasty is trying to obstruct me? How laughable!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Cloud Ancestor sneered, and with a flick of his finger, a beam of blood light struck the blue barrier, shattering it instantly.</p><p></p><p>In a moment,</p><p></p><p>Su Guangdao was struck by the backlash, his face turning deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Blood Cloud Ancestor, his eyes filled with a sense of despair.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that heaven is truly going to destroy my Xing'an County!?"</p><p></p><p>Mobilizing the aura to protect an entire county was the limit of Su Guangdao's abilities.</p><p></p><p>Normally,</p><p></p><p>with such a method, even if a Patriarch-level expert attacked, Su Guangdao would have the ability to block it.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately,</p><p></p><p>the one who acted was a Dao Palace Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>The power to suppress a Patriarch was like a mere illusion before such a powerful being.</p><p></p><p>"Perish!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Elder Blood Cloud's expression changed, and then he saw a Taoist monk in blue robes step into the void, causing the vast blood clouds to instantly dissipate.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Blood Cloud's expression was deeply grave, as the appearance of this monk posed a great threat to him.</p><p></p><p>"I am Gu Qingfeng. Those who dare to cause chaos shall be executed!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng spoke these words, then raised his hand and pressed down with a palm strike. Terrifying power shattered the layers of space, like the collapse of the celestial vault, shocking Elder Blood Cloud's heart.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng! He had just arrived in the Nine Provinces and did not know much about him. But as the other party struck, Elder Blood Cloud already understood - the visitor's strength was formidable, and if he did not go all out, he would surely perish here.</p><p></p><p>He would die!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this possibility, Elder Blood Cloud no longer hesitated, immediately summoning a blood banner. Terrifying blood clouds surged, covering the sky and obscuring the sun, as if they could corrode the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>However, this power was like paper in front of Gu Qingfeng. The palm strike pressed down, and all the blood clouds were extinguished, the blood banner violently shaking before shattering completely under Elder Blood Cloud's horrified gaze.</p><p></p><p>"No—"</p><p></p><p>Elder Blood Cloud was shocked and desperate. He had cultivated the blood banner for thousands of years, allowing it to truly ascend to the ranks of ancient weapons, yet it was shattered by a single palm strike from this unfamiliar cultivator. How could this not shock Elder Blood Cloud?</p><p></p><p>Disregarding the pain of the banner's destruction, Elder Blood Cloud turned and fled.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng, with his left hand behind his back and his right hand transformed into a blade, struck down towards Elder Blood Cloud's retreating figure.</p><p></p><p>"Boom—"</p><p></p><p>This seemingly simple action tore open the void for hundreds of miles. Elder Blood Cloud's figure paused, and in the next moment, he was completely cleaved in two, his body plummeting down.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, the shattered void gradually healed back to its original state.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Silence! The entire scene was deathly quiet!</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked towards the figure in blue robes, as if they had seen a terrifying existence.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Blood Cloud is dead!"</p><p></p><p>"He killed Elder Blood Cloud in just two moves, his strength is truly horrifying!"</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought that Elder Blood Cloud, who had dominated the Eastern Domain for years, would perish in this insignificant place... Gu Qingfeng, this name sounds familiar!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, of course it sounds familiar. He is the Martial Saint of the Nine Provinces, known as the number one expert in the Nine Provinces—"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was shocked by Gu Qingfeng's strength. Some newly arrived cultivators were completely unfamiliar with this name.</p><p></p><p>But for those who had already entered the Nine Provinces, this name was not at all unfamiliar.</p><p></p><p>Martial Saint Gu Qingfeng, the number one expert in the Nine Provinces! Before Gu Qingfeng truly displayed his power, these cultivators from the Eastern Domain had thought he was just a Shen Change Realm cultivator and paid him little attention.</p><p></p><p>The reason they feared the Divine Martial Kingdom was because it had four Shen Change Realm Ninth Layer experts as its pillars. If not for those four Shen Change Realm Ninth Layer experts, the Divine Martial Kingdom would have long been overthrown.</p><p></p><p>But now, these cultivators realized how naive they had been.</p><p></p><p>This Martial Saint was far more than just a Shen Change Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Killing Elder Blood Cloud in just two moves, as easily as crushing an ant, such strength was difficult even for a typical Dao Palace Realm Sixth Layer expert to achieve.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that his strength was at least at the Dao Palace Realm Seventh Layer, or perhaps even higher.</p><p></p><p>In this era of the末法, where Saints no longer appear, the Dao Palace Realm was the pinnacle of cultivation. Those who could truly reach the Dao Palace Realm Seventh Layer and above were extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>No one had expected that the Divine Martial Kingdom could produce an expert who was likely at least Dao Palace Realm Seventh Layer or higher.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone looked at Gu Qingfeng with trepidation and fear. In this era where the strong prevailed, Gu Qingfeng's strength made them feel terrified.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Palace Realm Ninth Layer!"</p><p></p><p>"This person is at least a Dao Palace Realm Ninth Layer expert!"</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Shi Yu looked at Gu Qingfeng with utter shock. While the others might not be able to fully comprehend Gu Qingfeng's terrifying power, as an Elder of the Purple Cloud Sacred Land and a Dao Palace Realm Sixth Layer expert himself, Shi Yu could accurately sense the horrifying level of power Gu Qingfeng possessed.</p><p></p><p>This level of power was something Shi Yu had only sensed from one person before - the Sacred Master of the Purple Cloud Sacred Land, who had reached the Dao Palace Realm Ninth Layer.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Shi Yu completely suppressed the many thoughts in his mind, even the idea of competing for the Sacred Person inheritance of the Divine Yang Sacred Land was directly abandoned.</p><p></p><p>Ridiculous. In the presence of an expert comparable to Dao Palace Realm Ninth Layer, even if the Sacred Person inheritance was excellent, no one would dare to act rashly.</p><p></p><p>After all, experts at this level were truly the strongest under the Saints. In this era where Saints no longer appeared, there were few who could contend with them.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were opponents of equal strength, who would risk tearing their faces off just for a Sacred Person inheritance?</p><p></p><p>The risk far outweighed the benefits.</p><p></p><p>When the Divine Yang Sacred Land was destroyed, it was because the sect had declined and lacked a powerful enough expert to deter others. But the Divine Martial Kingdom was different.</p><p></p><p>Even if they openly declared their possession of a Sacred Person inheritance, no force would dare to act rashly against them.</p><p></p><p>This was the influence of strength.</p><p></p><p>Just like the ancient Sacred Lands of Purple Cloud and Taixu, they possessed Sacred Person or even Great Saint level inheritances, yet who would covet them? It was simply because these two Sacred Lands had the strength to intimidate everyone.</p><p></p><p>Now, in Shi Yu's eyes, the Divine Martial Kingdom having an expert like Gu Qingfeng guarding them meant they had the qualifications to possess a Sacred Person inheritance.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the diverse thoughts of the cultivators, Gu Qingfeng's calm and majestic voice echoed, reaching the ears of every cultivator present.</p><p></p><p>"I care not where you all have come from or what your purposes are, but if you dare to lay a hand on the people of my Divine Martial Kingdom, your fate shall be the same as this one!"</p><p></p><p>This statement did not leave any of the cultivators present with any face. However, not a single one of them felt it was problematic.</p><p></p><p>Only Fu He had a stunned expression, turning to Gu Xuanand asking with disbelief, "This is your father?"</p>

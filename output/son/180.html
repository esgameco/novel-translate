        <h1>Chapter 180</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Many top-tier martial arts have disappeared from the character attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>The reason for this is that the Longevity Sutra's Refining Bone Chapter was derived from these martial arts, and now that the Refining Bone Chapter has been created, it has encompassed all of these martial arts within it.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Gu Qingfeng's attribute panel appears much more concise.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, there are many master-level martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took a quick look and finally found a master-level martial art that refines the physical body.</p><p></p><p>The Pure Yang True Body!</p><p></p><p>This is a supreme martial art of the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>When mastered, it can make the flesh and blood purely yang and unyielding.</p><p></p><p>Although the Azure Yang Sect's Azure Yang Sutra can also cultivate pure yang qi and blood, when compared to this, the difference is a hundredfold or even more.</p><p></p><p>"Pure yang flesh and blood is the most effective against evil spirits, which shows that the ancestors of the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect who created this martial art also had the intention of suppressing evil spirits!"</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that the thoughts of later generations have ultimately changed!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The slayer becomes the evil dragon.</p><p></p><p>From the existence of the Pure Yang True Body, it can be seen that in the beginning, the Heavenly Yang Sword Sect indeed had the idea of suppressing evil spirits, otherwise they would not have created such a supreme skill.</p><p></p><p>According to the introduction of the Pure Yang True Body, only a childlike body is most suitable for cultivating this supreme skill. If one who is not a childlike body cultivates it, it will be twice the effort for half the result, and it will be difficult to truly master it.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, Gu Qingfeng is no longer a childlike body.</p><p></p><p>However, with the attribute panel in hand, Gu Qingfeng is not afraid.</p><p></p><p>After Gu Qingfeng thoroughly studied all the cultivation methods and detailed introductions of the Pure Yang True Body, he finally gained an absolute in-depth understanding of this supreme skill.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that this Pure Yang True Body is not as simple as just requiring a childlike body, but the cultivation requirements are also extremely high. Only with the foundation of the Refining Viscera Five Realms complete can one cultivate this Pure Yang True Body."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Pure Yang True Body is different from other martial arts, this is a true master-level martial art.</p><p></p><p>Like other cultivated martial arts, they generally start from refining the skin, and then step by step cultivate to the upper limit of the martial art.</p><p></p><p>But the Pure Yang True Body is not like this.</p><p></p><p>This martial art starts from the master level and ends at the peak of the master level.</p><p></p><p>A martial artist who has reached the Refining Viscera Five Realms complete can enter the Pure Yang True Body at the initial stage of the Blood Master, and when the cultivation is complete, they can reach the peak of the Blood Master.</p><p></p><p>As a supreme martial art of the master level, this kind of martial art involving the Blood Master is undoubtedly much more precious.</p><p></p><p>Now that Gu Yang has brought many supreme skills, but the only one involving the cultivation of the Blood Master is this Pure Yang True Body.</p><p></p><p>Other master-level supreme skills are more like the Prajna Sutra, where the master focuses on cultivating the physical body before, and then cultivates the true qi after becoming a master.</p><p></p><p>These martial arts are not as consistent in refining the physical body as the Pure Yang True Body.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Gu Qingfeng had memorized all the cultivation methods of the Pure Yang True Body, and then glanced at his own attribute panel, only to see the words "Pure Yang True Body (Unmastered)" added.</p><p></p><p>"Upgrade!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not hesitate and directly used fifty upgrade points to upgrade the Pure Yang True Body to the entry stage.</p><p></p><p>With the breakthrough of the Pure Yang True Body, Gu Qingfeng felt a mighty blood force reviving from within his physical body, and his entire muscles and tendons became more refined, as if they had been tempered a thousand times.</p><p></p><p>The surging blood flow was like a raging river, rampaging and crashing through his physical body.</p><p></p><p>However, with Gu Qingfeng's current cultivation level, this torrential blood flow was not enough to shake his physical body at all.</p><p></p><p>Finally, this boiling...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The power gradually subsided, and Gu Qingfeng's aura also became stronger.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The True Yang Physique (Initiation, Flesh and Blood Pure Yang Level 1)! ...</p><p></p><p>"Flesh and Blood Pure Yang!"</p><p></p><p>"Impervious to evil!"</p><p></p><p>As the memories of cultivating the True Yang Physique flooded his mind, Gu Qingfeng finally understood the benefits of this cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>The moment he attained the Pure Yang Physique, even just at the initiation stage, he would be able to resist various evils and poisons, with most toxins in the world having little to no effect on him.</p><p></p><p>When the Pure Yang Physique reached its ultimate perfection, he would truly become immune to all poisons.</p><p></p><p>The advantages and profundity of this cultivation technique left Gu Qingfeng in awe, even with his current level of understanding.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had already reached the realm of an Extreme Dao Patriarch, and the breakthrough in the Pure Yang Physique did not allow him to advance his cultivation further.</p><p></p><p>If possible.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng hoped he could directly cultivate the Pure Yang Physique to its perfection.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately.</p><p></p><p>The remaining points for improvement had already been used up, and it was impossible to further enhance them.</p><p></p><p>In the coming time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng would focus on researching the Longevity Sutra and delving deeper into the Pure Yang Physique.</p><p></p><p>He would not place all his hopes on the attribute panel; if he had any improvement points, he would use them to directly break through. But without any points, Gu Qingfeng would have to rely on his own research and cultivation.</p><p></p><p>When he truly began cultivating the Pure Yang Physique, he realized the immense difficulty of this martial art, perhaps due to the fact that he was not a child, or perhaps because of his own aptitude.</p><p></p><p>But for now.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was still in the initiation stage of the Pure Yang Physique and found it difficult to make further progress, let alone achieve a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Your subordinate pays respects to the Honored One!"</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>In the main hall, Gu Qingfeng, unusually, stepped out of the Whetstone Hall and sat on the main seat, asking the visitor calmly.</p><p></p><p>The latter, upon hearing the question, respectfully took out two imperial edicts and humbly presented them to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"These are imperial edicts from the Great Xuan Dynasty. The King has instructed me to bring them for Your Honored One's perusal."</p><p></p><p>"Imperial edicts..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at the two imperial edicts, his expression not changing much, as he was already aware of the court's enfeoffment matters.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Enfeoffment should only require one imperial edict, but now there were two, which puzzled Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Immediately.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took the imperial edicts and examined them. After a moment, he let out a wry laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Apart from bringing these two imperial edicts, does the Great Xuan Dynasty have anything else?"</p><p></p><p>"No, they do not."</p><p></p><p>"The Great Xuan Dynasty is naive to think that two imperial edicts can make Gu serve them!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng nodded slightly, then his palm emanated power, completely shattering the two imperial edicts.</p><p></p><p>The titles of National Master and Martial Saint meant nothing to him.</p><p></p><p>The two imperial edicts.</p><p></p><p>Held no benefits for him whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>To think they could make him serve the court in this way, Gu Qingfeng found it laughable.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Great Xuan Dynasty offered some benefits, Gu Qingfeng would not be interested.</p><p></p><p>But whether he had any interest is one thing, and how the Great Xuan Dynasty acts is another.</p><p></p><p>The court's current approach has made Gu Qingfeng scoff in disdain.

        <h1>Chapter 146</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' led the army to attack and decisively defeated the imperial troops!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' crushed the remnants of the Divine Martial Army and incorporated them!"</p><p></p><p>"The influence of your offspring 'Gu Yang' has greatly increased!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' unexpectedly discovered the legacy of an ancient mysterious powerful expert!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' obtained the 'True Scriptures of the Heavenly Veins' and his strength has improved!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Whetstone Hall, Gu Qingfeng looked at the information on the panel, his expression involuntarily startled.</p><p></p><p>"The True Scriptures of the Heavenly Veins!!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng was not particularly shocked by the previous content.</p><p></p><p>After all, the downfall of the Crimson Flame Sect was already within his expectations.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>What really made Gu Qingfeng somewhat unexpected was that Gu Yang was actually able to obtain the legacy of a mysterious ancient powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>The True Scriptures of the Heavenly Veins!</p><p></p><p>Judging from the name, Gu Qingfeng did not know the level of this legacy for the time being.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Being able to be described as "ancient", it is likely not simple.</p><p></p><p>"The world is so vast, there must be many resources, it's just that I don't know what kind of profundity the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Veins possess!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he suppressed the thoughts in his heart and continued to create his own perfect martial dao.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>"The True Scriptures of the Heavenly Veins!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at the secret and rare book in his hand, which was made of an unknown material. Even with his current strength, it was difficult to damage the book in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>This True Scriptures of the Heavenly Veins was something that was found by an undercover agent in a sudden collapse of the ground not long ago, and was then handed over to him.</p><p></p><p>And the so-called True Scriptures of the Heavenly Veins was not a traditional martial art, but rather a kind of alternative secret technique.</p><p></p><p>"Condense the Nine Great Heavenly Veins!"</p><p></p><p>"Martial power reaching the heavens--"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang's mind involuntarily revealed the cultivation method of the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Veins.</p><p></p><p>This cultivation method does not focus on improving realm, nor does it temper the flesh and physique, but rather emphasizes the condensation of the so-called Heavenly Veins within the cultivator, thereby enhancing the cultivator's strength.</p><p></p><p>Condensing one Heavenly Vein can double the cultivator's strength.</p><p></p><p>If two Heavenly Veins are condensed, the cultivator's strength can be doubled twice.</p><p></p><p>If nine Heavenly Veins are condensed, the cultivator's strength can be increased ninefold.</p><p></p><p>To be honest.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was somewhat scornful of the description in the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Veins.</p><p></p><p>After all, there are many martial arts in the world, and there is no existence like the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Veins that is so extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Nine Heavenly Veins!</p><p></p><p>Ninefold increase! This is what kind of concept.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that the improvement of a cultivator's strength is not as simple as one plus one equals two.</p><p></p><p>A Refined Skin realm cultivator, if his strength is transformed by one fold, can already rival a Refined Blood realm cultivator. If he truly condenses nine Heavenly Veins, he may even be able to directly slay a Refined Bone realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>This.</p><p></p><p>Is the terrifying nature of the Nine Great Heavenly Veins.</p><p></p><p>And precisely because of the extraordinary nature of the Nine Great Heavenly Veins, Gu Yang has some doubts about the existence of the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Veins.</p><p></p><p>After all, such an extraordinary martial art, even if it is created by a Sect Master or the so-called Grand Sect Master, may not necessarily be able to create it.</p><p></p><p>Taking a step back.</p><p></p><p>If there really is a Grand Sect Master who created the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Veins and condensed the Nine Great Heavenly Veins, then how terrifying would his strength be?</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Grand Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Even an ordinary Sect Master, if he possesses the Nine Great Heavenly Veins, can directly slay a Grand Sect Master expert.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang has great doubts about the authenticity of the True Scriptures of the Heavenly Veins.</p><p></p><p>However--</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Doubt, he had also silently committed the entire cultivation methods of the Heavenly Vein True Classic to memory.</p><p></p><p>Although such a heretical martial art was most likely not real, if it was indeed real, it would be an unimaginably heaven-defying opportunity.</p><p></p><p>So, Gu Yang naturally could not afford to miss it.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, he summoned another shadow guard and instructed him to bring the Heavenly Vein True Classic, as well as all the secret manuals confiscated after the destruction of the Crimson Flame Sect, along with the evil spirits sealed by the Crimson Flame Sect, back to Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Then, Gu Yang began to tally the other resources of the Crimson Flame Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Hundreds of millions of taels of silver!"</p><p></p><p>"Countless ancient treasures and artifacts!"</p><p></p><p>"These sects are truly all rich beyond measureâ€”"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at the piles of silver in front of him and couldn't help but feel a sense of awe.</p><p></p><p>The amount of silver he had seized after occupying Taiyan Dao was less than half of what the Crimson Flame Sect had.</p><p></p><p>Although Taiyan Dao's forces surrendered quickly, and Gu Yang did not completely plunder and exterminate them, by occupying numerous cities, the stockpiles within each city had also fallen under his control.</p><p></p><p>Even so, it was still not as substantial as the resources of a single Crimson Flame Sect.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that these thousand-year-old ancestral sects possessed an enormous amount of resources.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Yang's eyes, these sects were like leeches that clung to the common people, constantly draining their lifeblood to strengthen themselves.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, while natural disasters and human calamities plagued the common people, these ancestral sects remained aloof and unaffected, as if they were above it all.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, not all ancestral sects were like this. Only those sects founded by cultivators could achieve such a state.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Lord Protector!" Gu Yi entered from outside.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang looked at him and asked, "Is there any news from the Tianyang Sword Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Recently, someone from the Fei family in Nanyang Prefecture went to the Tianyang Sword Sect, seemingly seeking their assistance. But since then, the Tianyang Sword Sect has not made any moves. I'm not sure if they have any plans. We have already stationed spies to keep a close watch on them, and they will report back immediately if there are any changes."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yi replied truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Yang's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He had always had people monitoring the situation of the Tianyang Sword Sect, as they were an immortal sect. Gu Yang naturally could not afford to be careless.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the Tianyang Sword Sect remaining completely silent, it was somewhat intriguing.</p><p></p><p>If the Tianyang Sword Sect were to make a big move, Gu Yang would not be too worried. However, their current tranquility gave him an eerie feeling.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, silence could be the most terrifying.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the Tianyang Sword Sect's foundations, even if Gu Qingfeng had already broken through to the Grand Master realm, they might not necessarily fear a Grand Master expert.</p><p></p><p>Puzzled, he decided not to dwell on it for now.</p><p></p><p>"The shadow guards should quicken their pace and try to eliminate the remaining resistance forces within Guangyang Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang pondered for a moment and then spoke.</p><p></p><p>The reason Gu Yang's army could occupy dozens of prefectures so quickly was not only due to the overwhelming strength of his main forces, but also because of the powerful shadow guards acting behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>In a war, it was not just a matter of numbers, but also the combat prowess of the upper echelons.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the formidable strength of the shadow guards, there were few forces within Guangyang Prefecture that could obstruct their progress.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the shadow guards could delve deeper into communication with the high-ranking officials of the court.</p><p></p><p>Whether they were willing to submit or not, there would be a perfect solution.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The government office was brightly lit.</p><p></p><p>Several people were sitting there discussing matters.</p><p></p><p>If there were other people present, they would have noticed that one of them was a middle-aged man with a refined and amiable appearance, but with a hint of the majesty of a superior, and this person was none other than the county magistrate Zhao Jiang.</p><p></p><p>The other two were:</p><p></p><p>One was tall and thin, named Shangguan Jiang.</p><p>The other was burly, named Ye Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In front of these two men, Zhao Jiang was humble and obsequious.</p><p></p><p>"My lords, the entire county is now under lockdown. How should we proceed from here?"</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Spirit Formation is almost complete. The people in the office must guard all the entrances and exits, and absolutely cannot allow what happened before to happen again.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the important matter will be delayed, and your days as the county magistrate will be numbered!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Yuan's gaze was cold and his voice was icy.</p><p></p><p>His words made Zhao Jiang hurriedly nod in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Zhao Jiang, Shangguan Jiang said in a gentle tone, "Your Excellency need not worry. If this matter is handled properly, we will recommend you for an appointment elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>A small place like Linxian has no great prospects. With your talents, you can certainly go to a better place and make a great achievement. Who knows, you may even one day enter the imperial court."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, my lords!" </p><p></p><p>Zhao Jiang's face lit up with joy.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Shangguan Jiang's gaze suddenly became strange, and an ominous and eerie power seemed to emanate from him, and the shadows under the candlelight even underwent subtle changes.</p><p></p><p>"I'm a bit hungry..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing him like this, Zhao Jiang was startled and hurriedly said, "My lord, please wait a moment, I'll make the arrangements!"</p><p></p><p>Saying that, Zhao Jiang quickly left, afraid that if he stayed any longer, something untoward might happen.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, Gu Qingfeng was practicing the Collapse Mountain Fist, a martial art he had already mastered. His movements were smooth and natural, as if they were innate.</p><p></p><p>This "mastery" meant that Gu Qingfeng had reached the level of the creator of this martial art, having gradually refined and elevated it through his own diligent practice.</p><p></p><p>As he executed the techniques, he seemed to have gained some unique insights. These insights were subtle, and Gu Qingfeng sometimes tried desperately to grasp them, but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>He understood that if he could seize this insight, he might be able to break through the limits of the Collapse Mountain Fist and take it to an even higher level. At that point, he might be able to break through the Blood Refining Realm without external aid.</p><p></p><p>However, grasping this insight was no easy task. Creating a new martial art was difficult, and breaking through the constraints of an existing one was even more so.</p><p></p><p>After going through the forms several times, Gu Qingfeng had completely assimilated the power of the Blood Refining Elixir in his body.</p><p></p><p>His purpose in practicing the martial art was to accelerate the digestion of the Blood Refining Elixir, in order to hasten his breakthrough to the Blood Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was the third day since he had learned about the Exorcism Bureau, and the sixth day since he had taken the Blood Refining Elixir.</p><p></p><p>Over the past six days, Gu Qingfeng felt that his qi and blood had reached a critical point, and he was just missing a trigger to complete the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the surging power in his body, Gu Qingfeng's gaze suddenly turned fierce, and he directly swallowed another Blood Refining Elixir.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The moment the medicinal pill fell into his abdomen, the terrifying power of the pill erupted, causing his entire body's blood and energy to instantly boil up. His skin flushed bright red, and his meridians and flesh throbbed with pain, as if they were about to burst open from the energy of the pill.</p><p></p><p>However, this transformation made Gu Qingfeng's eyes light up. The faint opportunity seemed to be about to descend upon him.</p><p></p><p>"Breakthrough to the Refine Blood realm!"</p><p></p><p>"It will be today—"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Gu Qingfeng unleashed the Collapse Mountain Fist again. Every move and technique he executed contained terrifying power. Powerful gusts of wind howled out, causing the air to suddenly explode.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Rumble! His fists struck like thunderclaps, even waking up the sleeping Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Yang arrived, he saw Gu Qingfeng practicing the Collapse Mountain Fist. Each move and technique contained unparalleled power, seemingly able to collapse mountains and split rocks.</p><p></p><p>This scene left Gu Yang dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Qingfeng paid him no mind. He had already entered a profound realm. The overwhelming power of the Refine Blood Pill and the full force of the Collapse Mountain Fist had fused, undergoing a transformation of sorts.</p><p></p><p>As Gu Qingfeng struck out with another punch, a blood-colored wolf smoke instantly rose up, transforming into a massive fist aura that shattered a two-person-tall artificial mountain with a single blow.</p><p></p><p>The mountain rocks crumbled, shaking the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>When he unleashed that punch, Gu Qingfeng's entire body creaked and popped, and the wolf-smoke-like blood energy within him gradually dissipated and settled down.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!" </p><p></p><p>He let out a long breath, then looked at his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng   Age: 29/100   Realm: Initial Refine Blood   Martial Arts: Collapse Mountain Fist (Unbreakable Lv.1), Iron Body Technique (Perfect)   Upgrade Points: 0...</p><p></p><p>"The Refine Blood realm has been achieved—"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression was filled with joy, as if he had expected this all along.</p><p></p><p>However, the changes to the Collapse Mountain Fist left him somewhat surprised, but he soon seemed to understand.</p><p></p><p>"Unbreakable, so this is the change brought about by breaking through the limits of a martial art!"</p><p></p><p>This realm, Gu Qingfeng named it "Break Limit."</p><p></p><p>To break through the limits of perfection is to "Break Limit."</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the Collapse Mountain Fist after breaking through the limit had risen from a low-grade martial art to a mid-grade one.</p><p></p><p>The so-called "unbreakable," at the moment the Collapse Mountain Fist broke through, Gu Qingfeng felt that his fists had become much harder, with his finger joints containing immense power.</p><p></p><p>If, when the Iron Body Technique was perfected, Gu Qingfeng's physique was as hard as iron, then the breakthrough of the Collapse Mountain Fist had taken it even further.</p><p></p><p>Splitting mountains and rocks with his bare hands was now easily within his capabilities.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the greatest transformation was the change brought about by the cultivation breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Before breaking through to the Refine Blood realm, Gu Qingfeng had never truly understood the difference between this realm and the Refine Skin realm.</p><p></p><p>But now, after the breakthrough, he finally grasped the true power of the Refine Blood realm.</p><p></p><p>If it had been his former self, Gu Qingfeng now had the confidence to easily slay three opponents with just his fists.</p><p></p><p>This was the gap between the initial Refine Blood realm and the perfected Refine Skin realm.</p><p></p><p>A single step of breakthrough was like the difference between the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>In the current martial arts world of Linxian County, the Refine Blood realm breakthrough Gu Qingfeng had achieved already made him the number one expert.</p><p></p><p>Even Xu Jun would be easily suppressed by him.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

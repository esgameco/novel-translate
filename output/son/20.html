            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Half-Step Bone Refining!</p><p></p><p>This was somewhat beyond Gu Qingfeng's expectations.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that the Scorching Sun Divine Palm reaching the pinnacle was just the completion of Blood Refinement, but he didn't expect it could advance further, stepping into the realm of Half-Step Bone Refining.</p><p></p><p>But upon further reflection,</p><p></p><p>What Cloud Pavilion said wasn't wrong either.</p><p></p><p>Half-Step Bone Refining is essentially the peak of Blood Refinement completion.</p><p></p><p>But regardless of how one looks at it,</p><p></p><p>The profundity of the Scorching Sun Divine Palm still fills Gu Qingfeng with great delight.</p><p></p><p>A powerful martial art.</p><p></p><p>If one can cultivate it to perfection, its power will undoubtedly be greatly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>The inscrutable nature of the Scorching Sun Divine Palm also means that the difficulty in cultivating this martial art will greatly increase.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took a look at his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Name: Gu Qingfeng   Age: 32/100   Realm: Mid-stage Blood Refinement   Martial Arts: Gu Family Fist (Unbreakable Lv.1), Iron Body Technique (Iron Body Lv.1), Great Tombstone Throw (Mastered), Iron Leg Technique (Mastered), Iron Finger (Mastered), Scorching Sun Divine Palm (Not Learned)   Upgrade Points: 0</p><p></p><p>As expected.</p><p></p><p>The Scorching Sun Divine Palm is currently in an "unlearned" state.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng realized another advantage of his golden finger - all martial arts in the world, as long as he carefully studies them, can be completely recorded, and then he can directly upgrade them with his upgrade points.</p><p></p><p>In the time that followed,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng quietly cultivated the Scorching Sun Divine Palm.</p><p></p><p>In the face of such a supreme mid-grade martial art, other martial arts were temporarily neglected by Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p></p><p>With a top-tier mid-grade martial art in hand, to waste time cultivating other low-level martial arts would be to lose sight of the bigger picture.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Gu Qingfeng had to cultivate many inferior martial arts, only because he didn't have a mid-grade martial art, so he could only hope to trigger a qualitative change through quantitative change.</p><p></p><p>While Gu Qingfeng was in closed-door cultivation, the White Stone Sect was also in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Mysterious strong experts appeared.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the heavy losses of many Blood Refinement realm cultivators from the major factions, it caused quite a few waves in the originally calm rivers and lakes.</p><p></p><p>Especially some factions that had previously been suppressed by the two major powers, they had some restless ideas.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Sky Cloud Sect.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Tianxing stood respectfully in front of a certain courtyard, his face slightly pale, indicating that the injuries he had suffered before had not recovered much.</p><p></p><p>After a moment,</p><p></p><p>The tightly closed courtyard door opened, and a brocade-clad elder walked out.</p><p></p><p>The other party seemed aged, but his eyes were bright and piercing, and his temples were also protruding, indicating that his cultivation had reached the Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the other party walked out, Cloud Tianxing felt a surging blood qi coming towards him, causing a look of shock to appear on his face, which was quickly replaced by delight.</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Elder has broken through!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I managed to break through recently."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Changkong nodded slightly, with a look of pride on his face.</p><p></p><p>The inheritance of the Sky Cloud Sect could only be cultivated to the later stage of Blood Refinement, and he was able to break through to the peak of Blood Refinement, which meant he had successfully broken through the limits on the basis of the Sky Cloud Sect's inheritance. This allowed him to step into such a realm.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the entire history of the Sky Cloud Sect, there had never been anyone who could break through the limits.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>Cloud Changkong had the right to be proud.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>He looked at the present Cloud Tianxing and frowned: "You're injured?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right..."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Tianxing smiled bitterly and recounted the events that had occurred.</p><p></p><p>When he finished speaking, a cold killing intent suddenly erupted from Cloud Changkong.</p><p></p><p>"Good, the Qin family, good..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Iron Bone Gang really thinks that our Tianyun Sect is just made of mud, not worth anything. This matter must be accounted for by our Tianyun Sect.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, this matter will never be settled!</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Tianyun Sect itself is not weak, it's just that there was no top-tier expert to lead the situation, which is why it is not as strong as the Qin family and the Iron Bone Gang.</p><p></p><p>But now, Yunchangkong has broken through to the Refined Blood realm, his strength is enough to rival the top experts of the two major forces, so he has the confidence to demand an explanation from the two major forces.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Tianyun Sect suffered heavy losses this time. Not only did two Refined Blood intermediate elders perish, but they also lost a top-tier mid-grade martial art. No matter what, the two families must give an explanation.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Yunchangkong was in closed-door cultivation to break through to the Refined Blood realm, so he had Yuntianxing lead other sect experts to go to Baishi City, intending to seize the Scorching Sun Divine Palm.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, an accident occurred in the end.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the killing intent in Yunchangkong's eyes receded, and he asked in a deep voice, "You said that old man Qin Wei died at the hands of a mysterious expert, what is the origin of this person, does the sect have any clear information?"</p><p></p><p>"That mysterious expert acts very secretly, the martial arts he uses are like the Collapse Mountain Fist, but even more exquisite. I suspect this person may have cultivated the Collapse Mountain Fist to its limit."</p><p></p><p>Yuntianxing told the information he had gathered without any concealment.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yunchangkong's brow furrowed slightly: "The Collapse Mountain Fist is just a low-grade martial art. Even if it has been cultivated to the limit, how could it be any stronger than a typical Refined Blood realm cultivator? According to your description, this person has already cultivated his qi and blood to the point of a raging inferno, and can slay many Refined Blood realm experts with his limit-breaking Collapse Mountain Fist, which means his strength foundation is not simple at all!"</p><p></p><p>A formidable rival! This is what Yunchangkong is thinking.</p><p></p><p>If it were him, he might not even be able to reach the other party's level.</p><p></p><p>However, the experts of the Baishi Dao are limited, if someone really possesses such strength, they would not have been so low-key and inconspicuous all this time.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in Yunchangkong's view, the other party is most likely not a martial artist of the Baishi Dao, and his appearance is probably because he is after the mid-grade martial art.</p><p></p><p>Now that the mysterious expert has succeeded, he has most likely already left Baishi Dao.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Yunchangkong temporarily does not want to think about this matter.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the mysterious expert has slain six Refined Blood realm experts from the two forces, which Yunchangkong sees as an ally of the Tianyun Sect.</p><p></p><p>After all, the enemy's enemy is a friend.</p><p></p><p>The two forces each lost three Refined Blood realm experts, two of which were Refined Blood intermediate and one was Refined Blood late-stage. In comparison, although the Tianyun Sect also suffered heavy losses, Yunchangkong still feels a sense of relief.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Yunchangkong left the Tianyun Sect and headed to Baishi City.</p><p></p><p>This matter, the two families must give an explanation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On this day, in front of the Qin family mansion, a dignified old man in brocade clothes stepped forward, and the Qin family guard who was about to speak was blown away by a powerful force, directly smashing the Qin family gate.</p><p></p><p>The huge commotion immediately caused the people around to change their expressions, and also alarmed the people inside the Qin family.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to come to the Qin family and act recklessly!"</p><p></p><p>A cold voice came, and Qin family warriors appeared.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the qi and blood power on Yunchangkong's body erupted, the terrifying blood energy rising like a rolling smoky haze, and the dreadful pressure spread out, causing the Qin family warrior who had just appeared to turn pale, his breathing becoming difficult.</p><p></p><p>"I am Yunchangkong of the Tianyun Sect, and I have come here today to demand an explanation from your Qin family!"</p><p></p><p>Yunchangkong's voice, filled with anger, echoed throughout the area.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

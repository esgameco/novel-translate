        <h1>Chapter 61</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The study was brightly lit.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang came here and had a conversation with Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Father, in this battle with the Qingyang Sect, I discovered that the Gu family also has a problem, which is that we Gu family do not have enough strong experts, and people we can truly trust.</p><p></p><p>Although those wandering cultivators serve as our guards, they ultimately have their own motives.</p><p></p><p>If their interests are aligned, they will obey our orders, but if their interests conflict, I'm afraid they may stab us in the back!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>His words made Gu Qingfeng nod.</p><p></p><p>"The things you said, Father has also considered them. What are your plans?"</p><p></p><p>"I think that since the Gu family is short on manpower, we should emulate other sects and families by recruiting and cultivating a group of orphans from a young age, so that they can be used by the family in the future."</p><p></p><p>"If the family's population can be increased in the later period, these problems can be greatly alleviated!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Gu Yang waited for the other's response.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng said, "The lack of manpower in the Gu family is indeed a problem, but if we want to recruit more people to expand the scale, the Gu family itself also needs to expand."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, Alang, you will be fifteen years old soon, and if a few more years pass, you should be at the age of getting married and having children."</p><p></p><p>"This is something that cannot be delayed, after all, the stronger the martial cultivator, the lower the probability of leaving behind offspring."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Gu Qingfeng looked at the change in Gu Yang's expression, and then asked, "Do you have any object of affection now? If you do, Father can arrange a match for you in a few years."</p><p></p><p>"These matters are all up to Father to decide."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang lowered his head.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Qingfeng did not say anything more.</p><p></p><p>In this world, it is the parents' orders and the matchmaker's words that matter. Given the Gu family's current status and position, it would not be a problem for Gu Yang to get married.</p><p></p><p>To be blunt, if the news of the young master of the Gu family wanting to get married were to be released, the Gu family's doorstep would be trampled on by various major forces the next day.</p><p></p><p>"In the next few days, you should find a place to serve as the new residence of the Gu family, as this place is a bit small."</p><p></p><p>"I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang nodded.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Qingfeng also guided him in his cultivation, and then let Gu Yang leave.</p><p></p><p>In the quiet study,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at his own attribute panel again.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Heavenly Flame Divine Body has broken through the limit, he needs 80 upgrade points to continue breaking through.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately,</p><p></p><p>After the last breakthrough,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng only had 60 upgrade points left.</p><p></p><p>To break through the limit,</p><p></p><p>He was still a little short.</p><p></p><p>And to collect enough upgrade points, it would most likely have to wait until Gu Yang makes another breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Yang has only just entered the Blood Refining Realm, so a breakthrough in the short term is impossible.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng plans to use these upgrade points to improve his strength in other aspects.</p><p></p><p>First,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng will focus on high-grade martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Now, his cultivation foundation is solid, but he lacks truly powerful combat techniques.</p><p></p><p>Like the palm techniques contained in the Scorching Sun Divine Palm, and the Heavenly Thunder Sword Technique, etc., they are only mid-grade martial arts. The former, although perfected, the techniques are not exquisite enough.</p><p></p><p>As for the latter, Gu Qingfeng has just barely grasped the basics.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's target this time is the Seven Killing Blade Technique.</p><p></p><p>This blade technique is a supreme military art, focusing on killing, and is a high-grade martial art. If he can cultivate it to perfection, it can further advance his strength.</p><p></p><p>So...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng did not hesitate, directly using 20 promotion points to upgrade the Seven Killing Sword Technique from the initial stage to the perfected level.</p><p></p><p>As the Seven Killing Sword Technique continued to improve, Gu Qingfeng seemed to have stepped onto a certain battlefield, becoming one of the foot soldiers, wielding a long saber and fighting to the death, gradually comprehending the profundities of killing and slaughter.</p><p></p><p>It could have been in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Or it could have been over ten or a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>When the Seven Killing Sword Technique truly reached perfection, Gu Qingfeng opened his eyes, and a startling icy glint seemed to shoot out from his eyes, and a terrifying murderous intent suddenly erupted, causing the temperature in the spacious study to drop significantly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Seven Killing Sword Technique (Killing True Essence Level 1)...</p><p></p><p>This was the peak level that the past masters who created the Seven Killing Sword Technique could truly reach.</p><p></p><p>Battlefield slaughter.</p><p>Condensing the true essence of killing.</p><p></p><p>Normally, </p><p>to condense the true essence of killing, one must be tempered through prolonged battlefield slaughter, only then would there be a chance of success.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Qingfeng used promotion points to break through, directly skipping the necessary steps.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, </p><p>Gu Qingfeng's comprehension of the Seven Killing Sword Technique was already on par with its original creator.</p><p></p><p>If he were to break through the limit,</p><p>it would require 40 promotion points.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng directly used the remaining 40 promotion points to elevate the Seven Killing Sword Technique to an entirely new height.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>His aura underwent another transformation.</p><p></p><p>In this moment,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng was like a slaughter demon that had emerged from the depths of hell, with a blood-red color flashing in his eyes, and a murderous intent surging in his mind, giving him an urge to slaughter all under the heavens.</p><p></p><p>But very soon,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng forcefully suppressed this impulse.</p><p></p><p>When he looked at the attribute panel again, the Killing True Essence had already been upgraded to Level 2.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p>Gu Qingfeng let out a long breath, closed his eyes to digest everything related to the Seven Killing Sword Technique, and after a long time, he reopened his eyes, and the blood-red color gradually disappeared.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the limit, the Seven Killing Sword Technique was equivalent to transcending the realm of superior martial arts, able to be compared to the finest martial arts.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the exquisiteness of the techniques, there was no difference before and after the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>The real difference</p><p>lay in the mastery of the Killing True Essence.</p><p></p><p>If the power of the true essence was strong enough, one could even kill with just a glance.</p><p></p><p>Now, although Gu Qingfeng's cultivation did not seem to have made any breakthrough, the breakthrough of the Seven Killing Sword Technique had already elevated his overall strength to a new level.</p><p></p><p>This</p><p>is the power of the martial arts of killing and slaughter.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the breakthrough of one's own cultivation realm, the advancement of the martial arts of killing and slaughter, although unable to allow the cultivator to break through their realm, can still enhance the cultivator's strength on another level.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the profound applications,</p><p>if the cultivator of the martial arts of killing and slaughter truly reaches a high level, their potential is unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Killing Sword Technique has been broken through!"</p><p>"Next, I should also forge a suitable weapon, otherwise, having the sword technique alone without a matching weapon to assist, I will not be able to truly unleash the full power of the Seven Killing Sword Technique!"</p><p></p><p>The next day,</p><p>Gu Qingfeng asked Meng Peng to help him find several master weapon forgers to forge a suitable weapon for him.</p><p></p><p>The jianghu, though not too large, is not small either, and there are some renowned weapon forging clans.</p><p></p><p>This force</p><p>was called the Sword Forging Sect.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the request of the Gu family patriarch to forge a divine weapon, the Sword Forging Sect did not dare to refuse, and hurriedly came to visit Gu Qingfeng to discuss the details of forging the divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 140</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chaos! The news of Pei Jing's death spread.</p><p></p><p>It was not just in Guangyang Prefecture, but the prefectures of Nanyang, Chijiang, and Danyang were all in great turmoil.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple.</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing had left no heir.</p><p></p><p>Now that Pei Jing was dead, the Shenwu Army that had been under his control immediately descended into internal strife. </p><p></p><p>Everyone wanted to seize the opportunity to overthrow Pei Jing's position, and a major internal conflict soon erupted.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Nanyang Prefecture Governorate.</p><p></p><p>The Prefecture Governor Pei Sheng was furious, smashing countless cups in the main hall. All the servants and other senior members of the Pei family looked at him with a hint of fear.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>"Gu Qingfeng, you deserve to die!!"</p><p></p><p>"You killed my son, destroying the hope of the Pei family. This enmity between our families will never be reconciled!!"</p><p></p><p>Pei Sheng roared in rage, the murderous intent in his eyes almost palpable, wishing he could rush to Guangyang Prefecture and have Gu Qingfeng and the entire Gu family slowly tortured to death.</p><p></p><p>However, Pei Sheng was also aware.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Qingfeng was truly a Grand Master, then it would be difficult for him to be a match for Gu's powers.</p><p></p><p>The title of "Grand Master" contained boundless might.</p><p></p><p>Even as the governor of a prefecture, Pei Sheng could not help but feel a sense of despair.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, with Pei Jing's death, not many of the Shenwu Army soldiers were truly loyal to the Pei family anymore. </p><p></p><p>This loss of power made it hopeless for the Pei family to seek revenge.</p><p></p><p>At this point, a Pei family elder cautiously said, "Family Head, why don't we request the assistance of the Tianyang Sword Sect? After all, the sect has also lost several Fusion Spirit Realm experts with the death of the young master. Moreover, the young master was also a true disciple of the Tianyang Sword Sect. No matter what, the sect cannot simply ignore this matter.</p><p></p><p>Even if this Grand Master is formidable, the Pei family may not be able to handle him, but the Tianyang Sword Sect certainly can."</p><p></p><p>"Correct, we should inform the Tianyang Sword Sect of this matter."</p><p></p><p>"In my opinion, the Tianyang Sword Sect will want to support the Pei family in vying for supremacy. Now that the young master has passed, requesting the sect's intervention could also be an opportunity for them to select another member of the Pei family to nurture."</p><p></p><p>The other Pei family elders also chimed in, each with their own thoughts. </p><p></p><p>When Pei Jing was alive, they had little chance to interfere, but now that he was gone, his death might not necessarily be a bad thing for them.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, with Pei Jing's death, if the Tianyang Sword Sect were to support another person, it was very likely that they would choose from the Pei family.</p><p></p><p>In that case, the prospects for their descendants would improve greatly.</p><p></p><p>If they were to be favored by the Tianyang Sword Sect, their branch of the family could truly soar.</p><p></p><p>Pei Sheng was also aware of this.</p><p></p><p>But he was powerless.</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing was dead.</p><p></p><p>He too hoped that another member of the Pei family would be recognized by the Tianyang Sword Sect, even if it was not from his own branch. At least it would revive the Pei family.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Pei Sheng's murderous intent only grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>In his view, if it were not for Gu Qingfeng killing Pei Jing, he would not have fallen into such a predicament.</p><p></p><p>"I will personally inform the Tianyang Sword Sect of this matter. Additionally, I will do my best to stabilize the morale of the army. The Shenwu Army that Jing left behind cannot all be turned into cannon fodder for others!"</p><p></p><p>Pei Sheng said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he had resigned himself to the situation. The most pressing matter now was to seize control of the Shenwu Army that Pei Jing had left behind.</p><p></p><p>Although the Shenmu Army was in turmoil, there were still some who remained loyal to the Pei family. </p><p></p><p>If he could control this remaining force, he might be able to recoup some of the losses.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has subdued the remnants of the Divine Martial Army, greatly increasing his foundational power!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' conquered the Taishan Road in three days, and his reputation is gradually spreading!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain 356 Refine Skin realm martial artists!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain 213 Refine Blood realm martial artists!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain 9 early-stage Refine Bone realm martial artists!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' is leading a grand army with majestic momentum, conquering several cities in just ten days, and the Gu family army's reputation has spread far and wide!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by a mid-stage Wash Marrow realm martial artist!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by a Third Realm Refine Filth martial artist!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by Third Realm Refine Filth martial artists 3 times!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring..."</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng returned to the Gu family manor, he saw a large amount of text refreshing on the information panel, with information about Gu Yang occupying 99% of the interface.</p><p></p><p>It is clear that after subduing the remnants of the Divine Martial Army, Gu Yang has led this force to begin conquering the entire Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>From the information panel, it can be seen that the Gu family army led by Gu Yang is almost unrivaled in Guangyang Prefecture, and they were able to completely conquer the Taishan Road in just three days.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng understands that this is not because the Gu family army is truly so powerful, but rather because of Gu Yang's reputation as the "Tyrant Saber," which makes the forces of the Taishan Road unwilling to resist.</p><p></p><p>A figure suspected to be a supreme grandmaster of the current era is enough to make people feel hopeless.</p><p></p><p>From this, Gu Qingfeng has also witnessed the influence that top-tier combat power can bring.</p><p></p><p>The title of "Grandmaster" is even more terrifying than an entire army.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng also understands that even without Gu Yang's "Tyrant Saber" reputation to suppress them, Gu Yang would still be able to easily conquer the Taishan Road.</p><p></p><p>This is because Gu Yang has five Innate Perfected experts following him.</p><p></p><p>Yes, five of them.</p><p></p><p>Three Innate Realm Promotion Elixirs have directly elevated Gu Yi, Gu Er, and Gu San to the Innate Perfected realm.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Gu Qingfeng has also sent Snatch Soul and Chase Soul to follow Gu Yang, one to protect him and the other to resolve any difficult problems.</p><p></p><p>As for Red Leaf, Gu Qingfeng has brought her back to the Gu family manor, letting her stabilize the situation there.</p><p></p><p>Many times, Gu Qingfeng is too lazy to personally take action.</p><p></p><p>With an Innate Grandmaster-level expert guarding the Gu family manor, as long as it's not a Transformation Realm or Supreme Grandmaster-level expert, they can basically handle any situation.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if it's an Innate Grandmaster who has comprehended the True Meaning, then it would be different.</p><p></p><p>Whether it's the Promotion Elixirs or the current reward of Death Soldiers, they only possess the strength of ordinary top-tier Innate Grandmasters, and not the true power of a Grandmaster who has comprehended the True Meaning.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, the realm of comprehending the True Meaning is an extremely profound one.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary Grandmasters, whether they have comprehended the True Meaning or not, it does not affect their breakthrough to the Supreme Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>This is because the breakthrough from Grandmaster to Supreme Grandmaster is simply a matter of accumulating power, but the comprehension of the True Meaning is a transformation at the level of combat power.</p><p></p><p>Top-tier Innate Grandmasters who have mastered the True Meaning are undoubtedly much stronger than those who have not.</p><p></p><p>However, ordinary top-tier Innate Grandmasters can also assault the Supreme Grandmaster realm, so the comprehension of the True Meaning is not a critical factor for breaking through to the Supreme Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

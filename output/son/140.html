        <h1>Chapter 140</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chaos! The news of Pei Jing's death spread.</p><p></p><p>It was not just Guangyang Prefecture, but the commanderies of Nanyang, Chijiang, and Danyang were all in great turmoil.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple.</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing had left no heir.</p><p></p><p>Now that Pei Jing was dead, the Shenwu Army that had been under his control immediately descended into internal strife. </p><p></p><p>Everyone wanted to seize the opportunity to overthrow Pei Jing's position, and a major internal conflict soon erupted.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Nanyang Commandery Governorate.</p><p></p><p>Commandery Governor Pei Sheng was furious, smashing countless cups in the main hall. All the servants and other senior members of the Pei family looked at him with a hint of fear.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>"Gu Qingfeng, you deserve to die!!"</p><p></p><p>"You killed my son, destroying the hope of the Pei family. This enmity between our families will never be reconciled!!"</p><p></p><p>Pei Sheng roared in rage, the murderous intent in his eyes almost palpable, wishing he could rush to Guangyang Prefecture and have Gu Qingfeng and the entire Gu family torn to pieces.</p><p></p><p>However, Pei Sheng was also aware.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Qingfeng was truly a Grand Master, then with the power he wielded, it would be difficult for Pei Sheng to be his match.</p><p></p><p>The title of "Grand Master" contained boundless might.</p><p></p><p>Even as the governor of a commandery, Pei Sheng could not help but feel a sense of despair.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, with Pei Jing's death, there were not many in the Shenwu Army who were truly loyal to the Pei family.</p><p></p><p>The loss of this force was making it hopeless for the Pei family to seek revenge.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a Pei family elder cautiously said, "Family Head, why don't we request the assistance of the Tianyang Sword Sect? After all, the loss of the young master is also a loss for the Tianyang Sword Sect, as he was their disciple. </p><p></p><p>Even if this Grand Master is formidable, the Tianyang Sword Sect may have the ability to deal with him, which we the Pei family do not possess."</p><p></p><p>"Correct, we should inform the Tianyang Sword Sect of this matter."</p><p></p><p>"In my opinion, the Tianyang Sword Sect will want to support the Pei family in vying for supremacy. Now that the young master has passed, requesting the Tianyang Sword Sect's intervention could also be an opportunity for them to choose another member of the Pei family to nurture."</p><p></p><p>The other Pei family elders also chimed in, each harboring their own thoughts. </p><p></p><p>When Pei Jing was alive, they had little chance to interfere, but now that he was gone, his death might not necessarily be a bad thing for them.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, with Pei Jing's death, if the Tianyang Sword Sect were to support another person, it was very likely they would choose from the Pei family.</p><p></p><p>In that case, the prospects for their descendants would improve significantly.</p><p></p><p>If they were to be favored by the Tianyang Sword Sect, their lineage could truly soar.</p><p></p><p>Pei Sheng was also aware of this.</p><p></p><p>But he was powerless.</p><p></p><p>Pei Jing was dead.</p><p></p><p>He too hoped that another member of the Pei family could be recognized by the Tianyang Sword Sect, even if it was not from his own branch. At least it would revive the Pei family.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Pei Sheng's murderous intent only grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>In his view, if it were not for Gu Qingfeng's killing of Pei Jing, he would not have fallen into such a predicament.</p><p></p><p>"I will personally inform the Tianyang Sword Sect of this matter. Additionally, I will do my best to stabilize the morale of the army. The Shenwu Army left behind by the young master cannot all be turned into someone else's pawns!"</p><p></p><p>Pei Sheng said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he had resigned himself to the situation. The most pressing matter now was to seize control of the portion of the Shenwu Army that remained loyal to the Pei family.</p><p></p><p>Although the Shenwu Army was in turmoil, there were still some who were faithful to the Pei family. If he could control this force, he could regain some of the losses.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' has subdued the remnants of the Divine Martial Army, greatly increasing his foundational power!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' conquered the Taishan Road in three days, and his reputation is gradually spreading!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' has slain 356 Refining Skin realm cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' has slain 213 Refining Blood realm cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' has slain 9 early-stage Refining Bone realm cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' is leading a mighty army with a soaring momentum, having conquered several cities in just ten days, and the Gu family army's reputation has spread far and wide!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by a mid-stage Washing Marrow realm cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by a Refining Filth Third Realm cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant 'Gu Yang' has been attacked by Refining Filth Third Realm cultivators 3 times!"</p><p></p><p>"Your descendant..."</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng returned to the Gu family manor, he saw a large amount of text refreshing on the information panel, with information about Gu Yang occupying 99% of the interface.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that after subduing the remnants of the Divine Martial Army, Gu Yang had led this force to begin conquering the entire Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>From the information panel, it could be seen that the Gu family army led by Gu Yang was almost unrivaled in Guangyang Prefecture, having completely conquered the Taishan Road in just three days.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng understood this situation well. It was not that the Gu family army was truly so powerful, but rather that Gu Yang's reputation as the "Tyrant Saber" had made the forces of the Taishan Road unwilling to resist.</p><p></p><p>The name of a suspected top-tier Grand Master was enough to make people feel hopeless.</p><p></p><p>From this, Gu Qingfeng had also witnessed the influence brought by the peak combat power.</p><p></p><p>The title of Grand Master was even more terrifying than that of a general.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Qingfeng also understood that even without Gu Yang's "Tyrant Saber" reputation to suppress them, Gu Yang would still be able to easily conquer the Taishan Road.</p><p></p><p>This was because Gu Yang had five Xiantian Perfected experts following him.</p><p></p><p>Yes, five of them.</p><p></p><p>Three Xiantian Realm Promotion Elixirs had directly promoted Gu Yi, Gu Er, and Gu San to the Xiantian Perfected realm.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Yuepo and Zhuihun had also been sent to accompany Gu Yang, both to protect him and to resolve any difficult problems.</p><p></p><p>As for Hong Ye, Gu Qingfeng had brought her back to the Gu family manor, letting her stabilize the situation there.</p><p></p><p>Most of the time, Gu Qingfeng was too lazy to personally take action.</p><p></p><p>With a Xiantian Grand Master at the peak guarding the Gu family manor, as long as it was not a Transformation Realm or Grand Master realm expert, they could basically be dealt with.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if it was a Grand Master who had comprehended the True Meaning, it would be different.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Promotion Elixirs or the current rewards of the Death Soldiers, their strength was only that of ordinary top-tier Xiantian Grand Masters, and not true Grand Masters who had comprehended the True Meaning.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, the realm of comprehending the True Meaning was an extremely profound one.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary Grand Masters, whether they had comprehended the True Meaning or not, it did not affect their breakthrough to the Grand Master realm.</p><p></p><p>This was because the breakthrough from Grand Master to Grand Master was simply a matter of accumulating power, but the comprehension of the True Meaning was a transformation at the level of combat power.</p><p></p><p>A peak Xiantian Grand Master who had mastered the True Meaning would be much stronger than a peak Xiantian Grand Master who had not.</p><p></p><p>However, ordinary peak Xiantian Grand Masters could also assault the Grand Master realm, so the comprehension of the True Meaning was not a key factor in breaking through to the Grand Master realm.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 93</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain a mid-level blood refining martial artist!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has made some progress in cultivating the Scorching Sun Divine Palm!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has made some advancement in his cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain a Malicious Ghost-level bizarre existence!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has slain..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The information on the panel would occasionally refresh.</p><p></p><p>But ever since Gu Qingfeng's reputation as a domineering swordsman spread, the White Stone Dao has also regained its former tranquility. Occasionally, there would be some short-sighted people who would cause trouble, but they could not stir up much of a storm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's current habit was to check the information panel daily to understand the movements of others.</p><p></p><p>However, this time, Gu Qingfeng's expression became slightly solemn as his gaze fell on one of the pieces of information.</p><p></p><p>"Malicious Ghost-level bizarre existence!"</p><p></p><p>Bizarre existences. </p><p></p><p>He had only encountered one before.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half a day later.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang arrived.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's brows furrowed slightly: "Have you encountered a bizarre existence?"</p><p></p><p>"How did Father know?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang was taken aback, but then he nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, in the past few days, many civilians have been disappearing, including some disciples of the sects and families. They came to our Gu Family Manor for help, so Gu Peng sent people to investigate the situation. They eventually discovered that the problem was with an abandoned temple.</p><p></p><p>So I personally went there to take a look, but unexpectedly encountered a bizarre existence.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, that bizarre existence was not too strong, so there were not too many unexpected incidents!"</p><p></p><p>Abandoned temple! </p><p>Bizarre existence!</p><p></p><p>Hearing Gu Yang's words, Gu Qingfeng's expression became serious: "Although bizarre existences are not as indestructible as evil spirits, they can still manipulate the mind and spirit of martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Your ability to slay that bizarre existence is related to your comprehension of the Sect Master's true intent.</p><p></p><p>If you did not have the true intent to protect the Dao, you would not only be unable to slay the bizarre existence, but even escaping would be difficult."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng had naturally understood these matters from his own encounters with bizarre existences.</p><p></p><p>Bizarre existences manipulate the mind and spirit, which is essentially a form of power at the level of spiritual consciousness. Martial artists who have comprehended the true intent have essentially refined their spiritual consciousness, so the influence of bizarre existences is greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>However, bizarre existences are still bizarre existences.</p><p></p><p>Such existences represent unknown dangers.</p><p></p><p>"You are the future of the Gu Family Manor, be sure not to act rashly. For ordinary martial artists it may be fine, but for existences like bizarre existences and evil spirits, you must be extremely careful!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng warned.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yang had an obedient look on his face.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Qingfeng shook his head slightly: "Now is a chaotic time, with all kinds of natural and man-made disasters. Bizarre existences are born from this, and outside the White Stone Dao, there may also be bizarre existences proliferating."</p><p></p><p>"Father is right, I have been hearing news of bizarre existences and even evil spirits lately."</p><p></p><p>"News of evil spirits..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Where did you get this news of evil spirits from?"</p><p></p><p>"The news came from the Nine Twists Path, apparently there are several villages where the civilians have disappeared without a trace. Although the court is trying to suppress the news, there is no wall that is completely impenetrable.</p><p></p><p>Although not much news has been made public, the major sects and families are all aware of this. </p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, our Gu Family Manor also has spies hidden in the Nine Twists Path, and this news only reached me a few days ago!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yang said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Nine Twists Path! Hearing this name, Gu Qingfeng's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>If he remembered correctly, the former Lin County...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Belonging to the Nine Curve Dao, the current situation in the Nine Curve Dao inevitably made him associate it with the events in Lincounty.</p><p></p><p>Immediately.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng instructed, "Keep a close eye on the news of the Nine Curve Dao, and even if there are traces of evil spirits, do not act without my order."</p><p></p><p>"I understand, father!"</p><p></p><p>"Go."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng waved his hand, and Gu Yang withdrew.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Curve Dao!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the evil spirits are truly related to this?"</p><p></p><p>In the study, Gu Qingfeng's gaze fell back on the Sect Master's True Intent diagram in front of him. As a perceptive martial artist, after hearing Gu Yang's words, his sixth sense instinctively sensed an ominous sign.</p><p></p><p>Evil spirits are different from the strange and eerie. </p><p></p><p>The appearance of evil spirits in an area can easily affect an entire prefecture or city.</p><p></p><p>Even with Gu Qingfeng's current strength, he was still wary of evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>"If there are indeed evil spirits appearing in the Nine Curve Dao, the Exorcism Bureau of Guangyang Prefecture should take some action. As long as it doesn't affect this place, there shouldn't be any major problems for now!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng took a deep breath and temporarily suppressed the ominous premonition in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He had always paid close attention to the matter of evil spirits. Now that he had learned of the news of evil spirits emerging in the Nine Curve Dao, Gu Qingfeng did not have the intention to go and take a look.</p><p></p><p>After all.</p><p></p><p>When he had witnessed the true troublesomeness of evil spirits, Gu Qingfeng had already understood.</p><p></p><p>Even if these things could be suppressed, it was difficult to completely eradicate them, and if he encountered powerful evil spirits, it was questionable whether he could even escape unharmed, let alone subdue them.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng naturally did not want to take the risk.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng continued to ponder the Sect Master's True Intent diagram.</p><p></p><p>With his continuous contemplation, Gu Qingfeng's understanding of the Tyrant Saber Slash and the Tyrant Saber's True Intent had become increasingly profound.</p><p></p><p>Among them.</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant Saber Slash had already reached the peak of the introductory stage and was ready to break through to the minor success stage at any time.</p><p></p><p>As for the Tyrant Saber's True Intent, he was still at the sixth-level True Intent stage.</p><p></p><p>However—</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng now faintly sensed the threshold of the seventh-level True Intent.</p><p></p><p>He had a premonition.</p><p></p><p>If he could step into the seventh-level True Intent, his personal strength could advance further.</p><p></p><p>The difference between the sixth-level True Intent and the seventh-level True Intent was not just a simple matter.</p><p></p><p>Now, the true intent power contained in the Sect Master's True Intent diagram was gradually weakening, and Gu Qingfeng suspected that this Sect Master's True Intent could at most support him to cultivate up to the seventh-level.</p><p></p><p>To advance further, there was currently no possibility.</p><p></p><p>—</p><p></p><p>In Guangyang Prefecture, in the Nine Curve Dao, inside the Nine Curve Sword Sect, the Sect Master Li Qing listened to the report from his subordinates, his face dark as water.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>One of the Nine Curve Sword Sect elders couldn't help but say, "Sect Master, several villages and towns have had their residents disappear, undoubtedly due to the work of evil spirits. The government authorities have not taken any action so far, and the Exorcism Bureau is also nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>If that evil spirit were to attack our Nine Curve Sword Sect, what should we do!"</p><p></p><p>The elder's fear was understandable.</p><p></p><p>The outside world had rumors that there were evil spirits appearing in the Nine Curve Dao, causing the disappearance and death of many commoners, but only the people of the Nine Curve Sword Sect knew that the missing were not just commoners, but also several sects within the Nine Curve Dao.</p><p></p><p>These sects might not be the strongest, but they at least had Blood Refining Realm cultivators, and their strength within the Nine Curve Dao was not weak.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Curve Sword Sect, as the top sect of the Nine Curve Dao, only had one Perfected Iron Bone expert as its pillar.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, just as Li Qing was about to say something, suddenly a strange and eerie murmuring sound came, like the wailing of living beings, or the chanting of deities and Buddhas, causing his expression to change drastically.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

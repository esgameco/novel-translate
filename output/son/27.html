        <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A fist came down.</p><p></p><p>The sword's shadow vanished.</p><p></p><p>As Chu Tianxiong's body crashed to the ground, the others were only just now startled awake.</p><p></p><p>They saw that Chu Tianxiong's chest was now sunken in, and he was coughing up mouthfuls of fresh blood. The other party tried to struggle up from the ground, but had no way to do so.</p><p></p><p>In less than a moment,</p><p></p><p>Chu Tianxiong was no longer moving.</p><p></p><p>He had died.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the other party was shock and disbelief, as if they could not believe that he had died so decisively.</p><p></p><p>"Sss... Chu Tianxiong is dead!"</p><p></p><p>"The Thunderbolt Sword Chu Tianxiong had cultivated to the Blood Refining intermediate stage for many years, and even stood on par with other Blood Refining late stage experts, yet he was unable to withstand Gu Qingfeng's single punch!"</p><p></p><p>"To kill Chu Tianxiong with a single punch, this person's cultivation must have already reached Blood Refining perfection, right?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the gazes of the crowd towards Gu Qingfeng were filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>To kill a Blood Refining intermediate stage expert with a single punch - it was only natural that they were shocked.</p><p></p><p>Looking across the White Stone Path, there were not many who could step into the Blood Refining realm, and among them, those who could cultivate to the Blood Refining intermediate stage were the elites.</p><p></p><p>Yet such an expert was unable to withstand a single punch from the other party. </p><p></p><p>The strength of this Gu family patriarch made them feel utterly hopeless.</p><p></p><p>But the most hopeless were the Chu family's people.</p><p></p><p>With the only Blood Refining realm expert of the Chu family now dead, the remaining members had no way to resist the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment, commotion came from outside. The crowd that had originally surrounded the Chu family to watch the show were all retreating, and then Luo Yu, the leader of the Iron Bone Gang, appeared leading a group of experts.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing Chu Tianxiong lying on the ground with a sunken chest, no longer breathing, Luo Yu's pupils suddenly constricted.</p><p></p><p>At this time, an Iron Bone Gang disciple walked out from the crowd and whispered a few words into Luo Yu's ear, causing the latter's expression to fluctuate.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Luo Yu walked up to Gu Qingfeng and cupped his fists in salute. "I am Luo Yu, the leader of the Iron Bone Gang. Greetings, Gu family patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>Before Gu Qingfeng could speak, the Chu family members rushed up, kowtowing and pleading.</p><p></p><p>"Master Luo, Gu Qingfeng has inexplicably brought people to openly commit murder, and our Chu family patriarch has been killed by his hand. We beg Master Luo to uphold justice for us!"</p><p></p><p>"We beg Master Luo to uphold justice--"</p><p></p><p>The other Chu family members also shouted in unison, their gazes towards Gu Qingfeng filled with resentment and murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Gu Qingfeng's expression remained indifferent. He simply swept a cold glance over the Chu family members, then looked at the Luo Yu before him.</p><p></p><p>"Master Luo, have you brought so many people here to stand up for the Chu family?"</p><p></p><p>This sentence did not give Luo Yu any face at all.</p><p></p><p>Luo Yu's gaze turned cold, and the slight smile on his face disappeared. "Conflicts and killings in the jianghu, the Iron Bone Gang normally should not interfere. But the Chu family and the Iron Bone Gang do have some connections. Gu family patriarch, you have inexplicably killed the Chu family patriarch, so you must give an explanation!"</p><p></p><p>"An explanation?" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng looked at Luo Yu as if he had heard a joke, his gaze filled with disdain.</p><p></p><p>"Do you Iron Bone Gang think you're qualified to make me give an explanation?"</p><p></p><p>"Audacious, how dare you be disrespectful to the Gang Master--"</p><p></p><p>The moment these words left his mouth, one of the Iron Bone Gang warriors suddenly felt a shadow flashing before his eyes, and then a fierce gust of wind struck him.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng slapped down, and the man's head instantly sank into his neck, a large amount of fresh blood gushing out as he died on the spot.</p><p></p><p>This sudden turn of events startled everyone.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Luo Yu was furious: "Gu Qingfeng, how dare you!"</p><p></p><p>Before the words had even left his mouth, Luo Yu took a step forward. His qi and blood erupted, turning into a billowing cloud of black smoke. His right fist struck out with earth-shattering force, a power that could split mountains and rocks, leaving onlookers stunned.</p><p></p><p>Unrivaled divine fist! Luo Yu! His iron fists were formidable weapons.</p><p></p><p>"Come at me then!" Gu Qingfeng's eyes turned icy cold, and his qi and blood also exploded out, his terrifying aura soaring up to the heavens. </p><p></p><p>If Luo Yu's qi smoke was only about a zhang tall, then Gu Qingfeng's was a towering five or six zhang high, his bloody aura permeating the heavens and earth, his scorching hot presence spreading out.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!" Luo Yu's expression changed drastically when he saw the immense qi smoke, his face filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>But he had no time to think further, as Gu Qingfeng's attack was already upon him.</p><p></p><p>A powerful palm strike shot out, the palm like a scorching hot branding iron colliding with Luo Yu's fist. The tremendous force erupted between them, but Gu Qingfeng's body remained as steady as a boulder.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Luo Yu felt a terrifying scorching heat suddenly explode from his fist, violently invading his body. The powerful backlash force sent him stumbling back dozens of steps.</p><p></p><p>"You..." Luo Yu had just opened his mouth to say something when that scorching aura invaded his organs, causing him to cough up fresh blood, his face turning deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>Defeated! The Iron Bone Sect leader Luo Yu had been injured and defeated in a single exchange.</p><p></p><p>This scene shocked the onlookers even more than when Gu Qingfeng had just destroyed Chu Tianxiong with a single punch.</p><p></p><p>Who was Luo Yu? A top expert of the White Stone Dao. With his own power, he had established the Iron Bone Sect, his divine fists unmatched in the White Stone Dao. </p><p></p><p>Yet this level of expert had been directly defeated in a single exchange by Gu Qingfeng, leaving everyone stunned by the latter's strength.</p><p></p><p>"This is your strength? I'm a bit disappointed," Gu Qingfeng sighed, his expression full of regret.</p><p></p><p>He had thought Luo Yu, renowned for so many years, would be much stronger. Turns out he was only about on par with Gu Qingfeng's own strength a month ago.</p><p></p><p>Now that Gu Qingfeng had perfected the Scorching Sun Divine Palm to the ninth level, and his cultivation had reached the half-step Refining Bone Realm, experts like Luo Yu were nothing to him.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have any last words to say?" Gu Qingfeng asked.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough... The Iron Bone Sect will no longer interfere in the Chu family's affairs. I beg you, Sect Master Gu, to spare my life!" Luo Yu, his face deathly pale, had abandoned all pretense as the sect leader, directly pleading for his life while enduring the scorching pain in his organs.</p><p></p><p>Hearing his words, Gu Qingfeng shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Is that your last words?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Gu Qingfeng slowly approached Luo Yu.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the latter's expression became panicked. "You can't kill me! I have the backing of the Divine Martial King. If you kill me, the Divine Martial King won't let you off!"</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the threat, Gu Qingfeng struck out with a palm, directly shattering Luo Yu's head and ending the life of the Iron Bone Sect leader.</p><p></p><p>After slaying Luo Yu, Gu Qingfeng turned to look at the Iron Bone Sect and the Chu family members, a cruel and icy smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Kill, today not a single one of the Iron Bone Sect or the Chu family shall be spared!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Gu Qingfeng immediately unleashed a massacre.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

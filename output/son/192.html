        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Instantly, it drew the attention of the other people.</p><p></p><p>When someone saw the countless corpses strewn across the Blood Mountain Manor, their pupils involuntarily widened, as if they had witnessed a terrifying sight.</p><p></p><p>"So many corpses!"</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to commit such an outrageous act in the Blood Mountain Manor!"</p><p></p><p>These people were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Mountain Manor was one of the twelve prefectures of Nanyang, a rather crucial location, not ordinary by any means.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there were many sects and prominent families existing within the Blood Mountain Manor, but now, they were nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>However, </p><p></p><p>before these people could be shocked any further,</p><p></p><p>a terrifying power suddenly surged forth from within the Blood Mountain Manor, unleashing a myriad of sinister, evil, and negative emotions.</p><p></p><p>In an instant,</p><p></p><p>the earth trembled.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth changed color.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a supreme demonic monster had emerged.</p><p></p><p>This dreadful power instantly enveloped the entire Blood Mountain Manor, and even beyond its borders, it was clearly audible.</p><p></p><p>At that moment,</p><p></p><p>in the Nanyang Prefecture, many powerful experts from the sects and prominent families were alarmed, turning their gaze towards the Blood Mountain Manor, their eyes filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>Some of the veteran powerhouses even recalled a scene from hundreds of years ago.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Mountain Manor is in upheaval, could it be that evil entity emerging again!?"</p><p></p><p>"Back then, the evil entity wreaked havoc, and the Heaven Yang Sword Sect along with the Exorcism Bureau paid a great price to seal it within the Blood Mountain Manor. If this evil entity truly emerges, the world will descend into chaos!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it..."</p><p></p><p>These powerhouses, upon recalling the events from hundreds of years ago, were filled with dread.</p><p></p><p>In the face of such a formidable evil entity, the so-called cultivators were as insignificant as ants.</p><p></p><p>Back then, the evil entity wreaked havoc in the Nanyang Prefecture, causing endless slaughter, and it was only through the joint efforts of the Exorcism Bureau and the Heaven Yang Sword Sect that they were able to subdue and seal it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Chongming Prefecture, the Sect Master of the Iron Sword Sect, Lu Ying, as if sensing something, involuntarily turned his gaze towards the Blood Mountain Manor, his eyes filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>"Trouble in the Blood Mountain Manor, the Nanyang Prefecture is about to descend into chaos again!"</p><p></p><p>"If that evil entity is allowed to emerge, countless lives will be lost..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Ying sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Iron Sword Sect did not wish to interfere in the turmoil of the world, as the current state of the world was in disarray. If the Iron Sword Sect were to get involved, their centuries-old foundation might be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>when the Guangyang Army invaded the Nanyang Prefecture, even reaching as far as the Chongming Prefecture, Lu Ying turned a blind eye and did not intervene.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>this was also due to his fear of Qing Feng.</p><p></p><p>After all, everyone knew that the Guangyang Prince had a powerful cultivator on his side, one who could rival the ancient Martial Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>Now, seeing the upheaval in the Blood Mountain Manor, Lu Ying could already foresee the impending situation.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>he had no choice.</p><p></p><p>He could not intervene.</p><p></p><p>According to the historical records of the Iron Sword Sect, the evil entity from hundreds of years ago was exceptionally powerful, far beyond the Iron Sword Sect's ability to contend with.</p><p></p><p>In fact,</p><p></p><p>the founding patriarch of the Iron Sword Sect had perished at the hands of that evil entity.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>an overwhelmingly powerful sword intent suddenly surged forth, ancient yet without any trace of decay, possessing a relentless sharpness.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of this sword intent caused the entire Iron Sword Sect to tremble, and Lu Ying's expression changed once more as he headed towards the rear mountain of the sect.</p><p></p><p>There, he saw that the massive boulder had crumbled, and a gray-robed Taoist had appeared, seemingly out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing the presence of the gray-robed Taoist, Lu Ying hastily bowed in reverence.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master Lu Ying of the Iron Sword Sect, paying respects to the Supreme Elder!"</p><p></p><p>"So you are the current Sect Master of the Iron Sword Sect?" </p><p></p><p>The Sword Taoist looked at the person before him, and his originally dull eyes suddenly flashed with a sharp gleam, which fell upon the latter, causing him to feel a sense of unease, as if he had been targeted by a terrifying existence.</p><p></p><p>Despite Lu Ying's current cultivation at the Innate Sect Master level, he couldn't help but tremble, and his blood and qi momentarily stagnated.</p><p></p><p>This change in demeanor made Lu Ying's expression even more reverent.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I am the current Sect Master of the Iron Sword Sect. I wonder what instructions the Supreme Elder has for me this time?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Ying had never truly seen this Supreme Elder before, as the latter had been in seclusion since before Lu Ying joined the sect. The only reason he could recognize the Taoist was due to the portraits and information about him that had been passed down within the Iron Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>All this time,</p><p></p><p>Lu Ying had assumed that this Supreme Elder who had been in seclusion for two hundred years had already ascended. But now, he realized that the Taoist was still alive.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this,</p><p></p><p>Lu Ying's heart was filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>After all, according to the records, when this Supreme Elder had entered seclusion, he was at the Qi Blood Sect Master level. Now, after two hundred years of seclusion, his strength must have advanced even further.</p><p></p><p>Especially with the terrifying aura Lu Ying had sensed from the Sword Taoist, he understood the Taoist's formidable power.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Iron Sword Sect, while not in decline, was only barely maintaining its status. If a top-tier expert like this were to emerge, the Iron Sword Sect could rise to even greater heights.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the bigger picture,</p><p></p><p>with such a powerful figure leading the Iron Sword Sect, the sect's future would be...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sect might be able to become a top-tier force like the Divine Martial Sect of Wu Prefecture, standing shoulder to shoulder with the immortal sects and families.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lü Ying's mind was filled with numerous thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Cultivator glanced at him, then looked towards the direction of the Blood Mountain Manor. The sky and earth had changed color, as if a formidable demonic entity had emerged.</p><p></p><p>"It has been five hundred years, and that evil entity has resurfaced. If it is not resealed this time, it will surely bring calamity to the world. The purpose of this old man's emergence from seclusion is to deal with this evil entity!"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Cultivator's words caused Lü Ying's expression to change, and all the scattered thoughts in his mind dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Elder, the evil entity of the Blood Mountain Manor is no ordinary matter. Back then, the Heaven Yang Sword Sect and the Exorcism Bureau joined forces, and they could only barely seal it, but even then, both sides paid a heavy price.</p><p></p><p>Now, if the Venerable Elder goes to deal with that evil entity, and something were to happen, it would be a loss for our Iron Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>It was not that Lü Ying looked down on the Sword Dao Cultivator, but he understood the terrifying nature of the Blood Mountain Manor's evil entity better.</p><p></p><p>That kind of existence, even if a Transformation Realm expert were to face it, they might not necessarily be a match.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Cultivator had been in seclusion for many years, and even if his strength had increased, he might not have reached the realm of a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Sword Dao Cultivator had reached the Grand Master realm, a Grand Master of the Martial Dao might still not be a match for a Transformation Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>In Lü Ying's view, the Sword Dao Cultivator was the hope for reviving the Iron Sword Sect, and he could not be allowed to perish at the Blood Mountain Manor.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Sword Dao Cultivator's brow furrowed, and his expression towards Lü Ying was somewhat displeased: "The founding principle of the Iron Sword Sect by my master was to eradicate evil entities and protect the peace of the land. When that evil entity of the Blood Mountain Manor emerged back then, my master personally went to suppress it. After that battle, my master returned with grave injuries and passed away within a hundred years. As his disciple, I have both the emotional and logical reasons to avenge him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the emergence of the evil entity will surely bring calamity to the common people. How can this old man sit idly by and watch?"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Cultivator's attitude was resolute, leaving Lü Ying at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Lü Ying spoke up: "Now that the King of Guangyang has taken control of the Southern Yang Prefecture, and news of the emergence of the Blood Mountain Manor's evil entity has reached him, that Martial Saint behind the King of Guangyang will surely not sit idle. As long as that Martial Saint takes action, there is a chance to subdue the evil entity of the Blood Mountain Manor."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Lü Ying quickly organized his thoughts, and his speech became much faster.</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, the Venerable Elder does not need to take any risks. Just wait for that Martial Saint to arrive, and all the problems can be solved. If even that Martial Saint cannot deal with it, the Venerable Elder would have no need to intervene either!"</p><p></p><p>"Martial Saint?" The Sword Dao Cultivator's brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Who is this person you speak of, daring to call himself a Martial Saint?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the Sword Dao Cultivator recalled the many memories in his mind, but he could not remember any powerful experts who had claimed the title of Martial Saint.</p><p></p><p>After all, the title of Martial Saint was no ordinary matter.</p><p></p><p>Without the corresponding strength and destiny, to claim the title of Saint would be courting one's own destruction.</p><p></p><p>Lü Ying said, "That Martial Saint was not self-proclaimed, but was bestowed the honorific title of Martial Saint by the imperial court..."</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, Lü Ying proceeded to explain everything about Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>The more he spoke, the more astonished the expression on the Sword Dao Cultivator's face became.</p><p></p><p>Until Lü Ying finished speaking, the Sword Dao Cultivator sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>"I never imagined that during my two hundred years of seclusion, there would be such an extraordinary talent emerge in the world, one who could slay the Ancient Overlord with a single sword strike. No wonder he is honored as the Martial Saint.</p><p></p><p>The martial cultivation of this person may truly be comparable to the Martial Ancestor of ages past!"</p><p></p><p>"With such a powerful figure emerging, the Martial Dao can be revived!"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Cultivator's face was filled with smiles.</p><p></p><p>The decline of the Martial Dao had been a long-standing issue. Ever since the Martial Ancestor passed away, the rise of the Sorcerers had gradually diminished the Martial Dao. But now, with the appearance of such a powerful figure, the revival of the Martial Dao was only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the Sword Dao Cultivator looked towards the direction of the Blood Mountain Manor, and his smile faded, his expression becoming serious once more.</p><p></p><p>"Based on your explanation, that Martial Saint indeed has the ability to deal with the evil entity of the Blood Mountain Manor. However, since he is in the Guangyang Prefecture, even if he receives the news, it will still take some time.</p><p></p><p>As for the evil entity, as long as it continues to slaughter living beings, it will only grow stronger. If no one steps forward to resist it this time, it will undoubtedly cause even greater trouble.</p><p></p><p>I am already advanced in years, and I may not have the chance to take that final step. Rather than die in regret, I might as well exhaust my last bit of strength, and at least try to secure a glimmer of hope for the people of the Southern Yang Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>As the Sword Dao Cultivator said this, with a wave of his hand, he shattered the surrounding boulders, revealing the secluded abode within.</p><p></p><p>"This is the place where I have been in seclusion. There are some insights I have left behind, as well as some inheritances of the Iron Sword Sect. As the Sect Master, you can enter and take a look. How much you can obtain will depend on your own fortune."</p><p></p><p>"As for the Iron Sword of the sect, I will use it to deal with the evil entity of the Blood Mountain Manor. If I perish at the Blood Mountain Manor, you can go there later and retrieve the sword."</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Cultivator patted the sword on his back as he spoke to Lü Ying, as if he was making arrangements for his final affairs.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Lü Ying to speak, the Sword Dao Cultivator let out a long howl, and his terrifying true qi suddenly erupted, causing him to vanish from the spot and rush towards the direction of the Blood Mountain Manor.</p>

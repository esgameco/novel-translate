        <h1>Chapter 170</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"That Prince of Guangyang has already established his dominance!" </p><p></p><p>In the capital of Qingjiang Prefecture, the Prefect Taishi Yi heard this news and his expression was unsettled.</p><p></p><p>Dominance already established!</p><p></p><p>This was something he had not anticipated.</p><p></p><p>After all, Taishi Yi had always believed that Gu Yang would not last too long.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Tianyang Sword Sect made a move, that Prince of Guangyang and the Gu family estate behind him would be instantly reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>Taishi Yi realized he had misjudged the situation.</p><p></p><p>That Hegemon Blade's strength completely exceeded everyone's expectations.</p><p></p><p>He had slain the ancient YutiƒÅn with a single stroke.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that he had even broken the legend of the undying evil.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful expert has already been whispered to have the title of the Martial Saint in the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>The Saint of Martial Arts!</p><p>The Martial Dao Sage!</p><p></p><p>There are many powerful martial artists under the heavens, and there have been some grand masters over the millennia, but none have ever been worthy of the title of Martial Saint.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng has earned the qualification to be called a Saint in the jianghu.</p><p>This is an unparalleled honor.</p><p></p><p>As long as Gu Qingfeng does not perish, Taishi Yi is clear that no one can shake Gu Yang even slightly, not even the so-called immortal sects and families.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>In Taishi Yi's view,</p><p></p><p>the Martial Dao is ultimately not as powerful as the path of the Occult Masters.</p><p></p><p>Even if Gu Qingfeng's martial cultivation has reached the level of the ancient Martial Ancestors, he can only live for about two thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Looking at those immortal sects and families, which one of them does not have a heritage spanning thousands or even tens of thousands of years?</p><p></p><p>At the root of it,</p><p></p><p>it is because these immortal sects and families can continuously give birth to powerful enough beings to ensure their foundations never crumble.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators at the Transformation Realm can live for three thousand years.</p><p></p><p>It may seem like only a thousand years more than the ancient Martial Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>But one must understand that this extra thousand years is enough to change so much.</p><p></p><p>An extra thousand years of life.</p><p></p><p>Means the other side has more time to cultivate the next generation of experts.</p><p></p><p>An extra thousand years.</p><p>Means an extra thousand years of accumulated foundation.</p><p></p><p>And then.</p><p>There is the issue of breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Martial breakthrough is arduous, even reaching the Grand Master realm, without exceptional natural talent, one has almost no chance.</p><p></p><p>In comparison,</p><p>for Occult Masters to break through the Transformation Realm, the difficulty is much lower.</p><p></p><p>To break through to the Grand Master level is already so difficult.</p><p>But to step into the realm of Gu Qingfeng and the Martial Ancestors, one must break free of the Grand Master shackles and take another step forward.</p><p></p><p>Over the millennia.</p><p>In the Nine Provinces under the heavens.</p><p>There have only been two who truly reached this level.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p>in Taishi Yi's view, even if that Prince of Guangyang obtains Gu Qingfeng's assistance and seizes the world, it will be difficult for him to truly stabilize the situation.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Qingfeng's lifespan is exhausted and he passes away, that will be the moment of the other's downfall.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the day,</p><p>relying solely on martial experts is ultimately too difficult.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p>if there was a choice, Taishi Yi does not have high hopes for Gu Yang.</p><p></p><p>But in the current situation, Taishi Yi also understands that it may not be up to him to choose.</p><p></p><p>The five prefectures of Taishan have fallen.</p><p>As the Prefect, he has reached the point of having to decide which side to take a stand on.</p><p></p><p>Either he exerts every effort to obstruct Gu Yang's footsteps, but the likely consequence of that would be his own demise.</p><p>Or he directly allies with Gu Yang and takes a gamble.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p>someone has suggested: "Your Excellency the Prefect, if it truly cannot be helped, why don't we abandon the assets of Taishan Prefecture and leave first?"</p><p></p><p>"Abandon the assets?"</p><p>Taishi Yi looked at the speaker as if he were a fool.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Now, if I were to abandon the foundation of Taishan Prefecture, where else in the nine states of the world would be a place for us to take refuge?" </p><p></p><p>With these words spoken, the other party was left speechless.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, without sufficient strength, abandoning one's foundation would be akin to severing one's own arm, which was naturally unacceptable.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Taishi Yi smiled wryly, "The great tide of the world is beyond our control. Now, that Prince of Guangyang is coming with formidable might, and there is also a master who can be called a martial dao saint backing him. </p><p></p><p>The four prefectures of Qingyun State will most likely have no one who can match them!"</p><p></p><p>"Since this is the inevitable trend, then I can only go with the flow!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has suppressed Lianyun Prefecture, greatly increasing his strength!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has gained a far-reaching reputation, and the name Prince of Guangyang is known to all!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has taken medicinal pills, slightly advancing his cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has received guidance from the Sect Master of the Divine Martial Sect, improving his cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>"Your offspring 'Gu Yang' has broken through to the middle stage of Refining Bones!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: +100 Cultivation Points!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 100 Refining Bones Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 100 Marrow-Washing Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"Reward: 10 Refining Viscera Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Middle stage of Refining Bones achieved!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingfeng's expression changed slightly. </p><p></p><p>As for Gu Yang's cultivation breakthrough, he was not particularly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Yang had not been in the initial stage of Refining Bones for long, his own natural talent was not weak, and now he was also in control of various prefectures, with an abundance of resources at his disposal.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, from the information panel, it could be seen that Gu Qingfeng had also provided him with much guidance.</p><p></p><p>Given these circumstances, Gu Yang's breakthrough was only natural.</p><p></p><p>With abundant resources and guidance from a powerful expert, even a mediocre talent could forcefully break through, let alone Gu Yang, who was not a mediocre talent.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Gu Qingfeng would have been quite delighted by Gu Yang's breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>However, in the current situation, the benefits brought by Gu Yang's breakthrough were no longer enough to move Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Each advancement in the Heavenly Dao True Scriptures would provide a tenfold increase in Cultivation Points.</p><p></p><p>The last time he broke through, Gu Qingfeng had spent a thousand Cultivation Points. Now, for the next breakthrough, he would need ten thousand Cultivation Points.</p><p></p><p>Given the current circumstances, accumulating ten thousand Cultivation Points was a distant and uncertain prospect.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Qingfeng abandoned the idea of continuing to accumulate Cultivation Points to advance the Heavenly Dao True Scriptures.</p><p></p><p>However, apart from the Heavenly Dao True Scriptures, ordinary martial arts were of little use to him.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, he would need to reach the Grandmaster level of martial arts to bring about any significant improvement for Gu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Since that is the case, then I shall focus on advancing the Sun and Moon Fist Classic."</p><p></p><p>Although he had always practiced the way of the sword, the Sun and Moon Fist Classic, as the supreme martial art of the Divine Fist Sect, was also profoundly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Gu Qingfeng made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>Consuming a hundred Cultivation Points, the Sun and Moon Fist Classic, which he had not even begun to learn before, instantly broke through to the Mastery stage.</p><p></p><p>As the Sun and Moon Fist Classic reached the Mastery stage, Gu Qingfeng felt a surge of profound memories flooding his mind, and his blood and qi were stirred, as if his fists had undergone endless tempering, containing formidable divine might.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Gu Qingfeng opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Whew!"</p><p></p><p>"The Sun and Moon Fist Classic is indeed the supreme martial art of the Divine Fist Sect. Its profundity is far better than I had imagined."</p><p></p><p>Decades or even hundreds of years of tempering had allowed the Sun and Moon Fist Classic to reach the Mastery stage, and had also strengthened Gu Qingfeng's blood and qi.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Qingfeng's cultivation was still at the initial stage of the Extreme Dao Grandmaster realm, his strength had once again increased to some extent.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

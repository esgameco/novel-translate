        <div class="content">
            <p>"The soul of heaven and earth, once it has accepted its heavenly duty, will never suddenly disappear unless it is killed by someone before completing its mission." The white-haired man whispered.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator was stunned at first, not understanding why the other party suddenly brought this up.</p><p></p><p>However, after a moment, he was slightly startled and said with some uncertainty, "Brother Zhan, do you mean that these two incidents were done by the same organization?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, right?" The black-robed cultivator frowned, "To be able to kill the soul of heaven and earth without attracting the attention of the Immortal Alliance. Such strength..."</p><p></p><p>The white-haired man surnamed Zhan smiled disdainfully, "Brother Xiang, don't you find it strange that your Xiang family has only recently discovered this Liefeng Dongtian. How could these foreign cultivators know about it?"</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, an ordinary Yuan Ying Dongtian is actually nothing special. The key is that the ability demonstrated behind this makes people feel a bit uneasy."</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the Immortal Alliance attaches great importance to this matter, and even a Transmitter has intervened." The white-haired man said with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator was shocked and terrified, "This... why go to such lengths?"</p><p></p><p>He, who had been somewhat arrogant in his tone earlier, actually became a little nervous after hearing the three words "Transmitter".</p><p></p><p>This matter had already involved so deeply behind the scenes, which was really beyond his imagination.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xiang also knows that my father works in the 'Zhangtian Department'. Therefore..." The white-haired man stopped at that.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator nodded, constantly pondering in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator surnamed Zhan looked at his good friend, and there were actually some words in his heart that he hadn't said yet.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Zhangtian Department is a mysterious organization within the Immortal Alliance that specializes in observing and supervising the traces of the souls of heaven and earth and the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>It is not on the official list of organizations, and only a very small number of cultivators know about the existence of the Zhangtian Department.</p><p></p><p>The souls of heaven and earth involve the power of the Dao convergence.</p><p></p><p>Each one is extremely important, so it makes sense for the Immortal Alliance to monitor them.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, the efficiency of trying to bring every soul of heaven and earth under the monitoring of the Zhangtian Department has become higher and higher. Although it cannot be done 100%, nearly one-third of the souls of heaven and earth in the present world have been registered by the Zhangtian Department.</p><p></p><p>This can be considered the most precious wealth of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>However, this is actually just an incidental task of the Zhangtian Department.</p><p></p><p>The true responsibility of the Zhangtian Department is to monitor the traces of the laws of heaven and earth at all times.</p><p></p><p>Even if the laws of heaven and earth remain unchanged for nearly thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>But the Zhangtian Department must always keep a close eye on it and never relax in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>The laws of heaven and earth are like a huge net crisscrossing and interweaving, weaving together the Dao of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>There are immortal venerable ones who go against the laws of heaven and earth and thus become a part of this huge net.</p><p></p><p>The process of going against the laws will inevitably trigger the strings of this huge net.</p><p></p><p>Thereby emitting bursts of fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>The higher the degree of reversal, the stronger the fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>Through this method, it is possible to observe whether there are cultivators who are reversing the laws of heaven and earth and attesting to immortality.</p><p></p><p>If such traces are discovered, the identity of the cultivator who is reversing the laws must be immediately investigated.</p><p></p><p>If the other party belongs to the Five Elders Council, then we must do everything possible and spare no effort to prevent the other party from successfully reversing the laws.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The various aspects of the Zhangtian Department flashed through Zhan Fei's mind.</p><p></p><p>For this organization that he was about to serve, he actually had no good feelings in his heart. Even though his father had already unknown</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>He had emphasized the importance of the Heavenly Controller countless times in front of him.</p><p></p><p>After all, once you enter the Heavenly Controller, for the majority of your life, you have to sit still in front of that instrument.</p><p></p><p>You might not even have a single day off in a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>This kind of life...</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the appointment of the Heavenly Controller was not something he could influence.</p><p></p><p>Zhan Fei looked at his good friend beside him, a trace of envy flashing through his heart.</p><p></p><p>Actually, being a local tyrant wasn't bad either.</p><p></p><p>However, the black-robed cultivator named Xiang Zengqiang did not know what his good friend was thinking.</p><p></p><p>He pondered and hesitated for a while, and finally made a decision.</p><p></p><p>First, find out the identity of the cultivator who stole the Liefeng Dongtian, but don't act rashly.</p><p></p><p>Wait and see how the Heavenly Controller reacts first.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli, who had already returned to Haixuan Island, originally didn't know that he was being watched.</p><p></p><p>However, after he dealt with many miscellaneous matters of the mutual aid society, he received an anonymous message.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Ji, do you have a grudge with the Xiang family of Juchao Prefecture? I see someone there secretly inquiring about your information."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's expression was puzzled: "Juchao Prefecture?"</p><p></p><p>He frowned tightly.</p><p></p><p>His only connection with Juchao Prefecture was probably the Liefeng Dongtian he had devoured not long ago.</p><p></p><p>He immediately understood the possible reason for offending the other party.</p><p></p><p>After a series of searches, Ji Shaoli's heart relaxed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Even if they came to his door, Ji Shaoli was fearless.</p><p></p><p>"However, I still need to make some preparations."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Tianjian Sect, Sword Tomb.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who was concentrating on comprehending, suddenly woke up with a start.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't because of the crisis his avatar might face, but because he inexplicably couldn't comprehend anything from the [Sword] at all.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked around.</p><p></p><p>He found that it wasn't just him.</p><p></p><p>The thousands of remnant swords in the Sword Tomb also seemed to have lost their connection to the [Sword] at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The slightly bent sword bodies returned to being straight, looking utterly confused.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared intently at the wooden sword in front of him: "Is it its own change? Loss of spiritual nature?"</p><p></p><p>"No, this is temporary."</p><p></p><p>Very quickly, Li Fan noticed the clue.</p><p></p><p>He didn't act rashly, just carefully observed the wooden sword and patiently waited.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, just a quarter of an hour later, the wooden sword once again regained its magnificence as a Heavenly Wonder.</p><p></p><p>Filled with the profound mystery of the sword, causing thousands of swords to bow their heads.</p><p></p><p>The question was...</p><p></p><p>What happened during that quarter of an hour?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately became interested.</p><p></p><p>While comprehending the Dao of the Sword, he waited for the next "failure" event to occur.</p><p></p><p>After several consecutive days of observation, Li Fan also discovered the pattern in it.</p><p></p><p>Every period of time, the swords would regularly lose their spirituality for a quarter of an hour.</p><p></p><p>During this time, the thousands of remnant swords in the Sword Tomb also simultaneously lost their connection to the [Sword].</p><p></p><p>There was only one exception!</p><p></p><p>Thanks to the existence of the Dao Stone in his mind, Li Fan was able to completely record the reactions of each sword before and after, and then compare them one by one.</p><p></p><p>Thus discovering this peculiarity!</p><p></p><p>Locking onto the target, when the next "failure" event occurred, Li Fan leaped to its side.</p><p></p><p>It was an inconspicuous black sword covered in dust.</p><p></p><p>Plain and simple.</p><p></p><p>It had neither a sharp blade nor an intricate design.</p><p></p><p>It was like the first practice work of a blacksmith apprentice, looking so ordinary and even a bit ugly.</p><p></p><p>But it was this very sword that gained the favor of the wooden sword, the Heavenly Wonder.</p><p></p><p>If this scene of thousands of swords in the Sword Tomb paying homage was said to be the wooden sword giving a unified lesson.</p>

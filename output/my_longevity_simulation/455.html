        <h1>Chapter 455</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Mo Sha, who obtained the terrifying end-of-world decree, was truly dreadful.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators who had just formed their Dao had no power to resist in front of Him.</p><p></p><p>"The actual combat power of Junior Brother Tianyang is probably not even as good as Zhang Zhiliang from the previous life, so I won't let him go to his death."</p><p></p><p>"The puppet body is different from normal humans. There may be other methods to improve combat power besides breaking through realms."</p><p></p><p>"The cost of creation is high, but once Congyun Sea is destroyed and I run away with the money, it will be enough for me."</p><p></p><p>After a brief contemplation, Li Fan ultimately abandoned the plan to let Tianyang take the risk of trying to form his Dao and instead focused on observing and protecting him.</p><p></p><p>Fifteen days later.</p><p></p><p>As all the resources in the Return to Origin Formation were exhausted, Tianyang also completed his final transformation.</p><p></p><p>The puppet body was perfectly completed, and his realm stabilized at the Nascent Divinity stage.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Tianyang's combat heavily relies on his brute strength. We need to find ways to hone his skills."</p><p></p><p>With his cultivation completed and nothing else to do, Tianyang silently stood up and followed behind Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took out the prepared clothing from his storage ring and helped him put it on, while also imparting the Secret Technique of Concealing the Sky with One Hand to him.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, next, you will learn this technique. Once you have mastered it, you can accompany me in our future actions." Li Fan instructed.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang nodded solemnly and began studying diligently.</p><p></p><p>With just a hint of intuition, the secrets of the Tianji Sect were still somewhat complex for Tianyang. Thankfully, with Li Fan's careful guidance and his focused efforts, he would eventually master them.</p><p></p><p>While Tianyang was earnestly improving himself under Li Fan's guidance, the latter directed his attention to Lingwu Island.</p><p></p><p>He made a quiet visit to Lingwu Island and silently locked the island with an imperceptible killing intent technique.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Tianxuan Mirror, he began discreetly purchasing Lingwu Grass while waiting patiently.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the day of the attack by the Dragon Whale Beast from the previous life arrived on Lingwu Island.</p><p></p><p>However, to his surprise, until sunset, the Dragon Whale had not appeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately had a bad premonition.</p><p></p><p>As he feared, three days passed, and Lingwu Island remained unscathed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan finally confirmed that the variables he brought to the Xuanhuang Realm a year earlier could not be avoided.</p><p></p><p>Without rushing into action, Li Fan first carefully investigated the news about the disappeared beast.</p><p></p><p>After half a day of searching, he found nothing.</p><p></p><p>Finally, through anonymously posting a reward for information, Li Fan obtained the answer.</p><p></p><p>The beast had recently been killed by a Golden Pill Refiner named Yue Zaisen, who took all its valuable materials and even offered to sell them at a low price.</p><p></p><p>After some feigned inquiry, Li Fan purchased some segments of the whale bones.</p><p></p><p>Upon completing the transaction, Li Fan engaged the refiner in conversation, trying to learn the reasons behind his unusual behavior.</p><p></p><p>It was not classified information, and Yue Zaisen quickly spilled the beans to Li Fan in the absence of suspicion.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that at the request of his friend Mu Rong, Yue Zaisen ventured to collect materials scattered throughout Congyun Sea to forge a high-quality defensive artifact.</p><p></p><p>As for why Mu Rong, a well-behaved person, suddenly had such an idea, Yue Zaisen did not inquire.</p><p></p><p>"Mu Rong..." Li Fan interrupted the communication, his expression changing.</p><p></p><p>The name was not unfamiliar to him, and they had even interacted before.</p><p></p><p>Mu Rong was Chen Ying's assistant, and before Chen Ying went to the Five Elements Great Hidden Realm in the previous life, he had left his contact information for Li Fan, in case he had any questions.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he saw Chen Ying purchase numerous lifesaving treasures and felt a sense of crisis? Thus, he made this move?"</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps Chen Ying said something to him..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt helpless for a moment.</p><p></p><p>In any case, the Dragon Whale did not attack Lingwu Island. To correct the history back to its original trajectory, Li Fan had to take action personally.</p><p></p><p>"The risk is not small, and it needs to be done without leaving a trace." Li Fan didn't act hastily but carefully planned in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Disguise as a beast? Or use the power of the Five Elders Association?"</p><p></p><p>"Maybe it doesn't necessarily have to be focused on Lingwu Grass. As long as it meets the stable demand quota and grows only in certain special regions, such as spiritual herbs and plants." </p><p></p><p>"Let's see if there are similar existences."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered and carefully searched in the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>There were plenty of targets that met the conditions, but he added a constraint, focusing on those with recent abnormal price fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>After careful scrutiny, Li Fan finally fixed his gaze on a spiritual plant called the "Universal Wise Leaf."</p><p></p><p>This herb had a long growth cycle and was not commonly used, with its main purpose being to create a talisman called the "Wisdom Discernment."</p><p></p><p>During the time before the Tianxuan Locking Spiritual Array was developed, the Five Elders Association's spies were everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Most of them, like Zhou Qing'ang, possessed shapeshifting secret techniques that could even deceive the White Jade Questioning Heart Platform's test.</p><p></p><p>When the Wisdom Discernment talisman was first invented hundreds of years ago, it had made significant contributions by exposing several spies within the Five Elders Association.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, a customary rule was established that before entering certain important areas of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, one must first pass the verification of the Wisdom Discernment talisman.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Five Elders Association had improved their spies' hiding methods, the Wisdom Discernment talisman had since lost its efficacy.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, using the Wisdom Discernment talisman had become a sort of habit.</p><p></p><p>It was impossible for members of the Five Elders Association to openly announce that the Wisdom Discernment talisman had lost its effectiveness.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance also did not decide to remove the Wisdom Discernment talisman.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a profit chain had formed behind the production and manufacture of the Wisdom Discernment talisman.</p><p></p><p>Driven by various reasons, the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance still needed a considerable quantity of Universal Wise Leaves every year.</p><p></p><p>For some unknown reason, the stable price of Universal Wise Leaves had slowly started to decline recently.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>He remembered that in the previous life, as the price of Lingwu Grass skyrocketed, it had led to an increase in the prices of other spiritual herbs and plants in the market.</p><p></p><p>The Universal Wise Leaf, however, was an exception.</p>

            <p>He Zhenghao's eyes lit up, as if he had received some extraordinary information from Li Fan, this senior. New69book28shu.com</p><p></p><p>He was eagerly looking forward to hearing more, but the other suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>This made He Zhenghao extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>He hesitated several times, wanting to speak but stopping himself.</p><p></p><p>"How is it, we both practice the same cultivation technique now, it's already good that we're not at odds. Do you hope I can give you some guidance?" Li Fan sneered.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao, however, realized that this senior only appeared to be a bit fierce on the surface.</p><p></p><p>He was not really a wicked person.</p><p></p><p>Hastily, He Zhenghao said, "Senior's insight is keen, you see clearly. Although the 'Sitting on the Mountain Technique' is an unparalleled divine skill, my progress in cultivating it has been too slow. I have been thinking of switching to a different technique."</p><p></p><p>"Please rest assured, senior, I will never compete with you for techniques."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing He Zhenghao's statement, Li Fan's expression softened slightly.</p><p></p><p>"You are a sensible boy, and it saves me from committing more sins."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao tentatively asked, "However, I have been practicing the 'Sitting on the Mountain Technique' for over a hundred years, pouring a lot of emotions into it."</p><p></p><p>"I only know that I may have practiced it wrongly, but I do not know the correct way to cultivate it."</p><p></p><p>"I feel a sense of reluctance."</p><p></p><p>"I hope that senior can enlighten me."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully examined him.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, He Zhenghao felt the nervousness he had when he first saw a cultivator back when he was still an ordinary human.</p><p></p><p>"After all, we were originally separated by thousands of years, but being able to practice the same technique together shows that our fate is not shallow. The mysteries of fate are unpredictable, perhaps meeting you after I wake up is also fate."</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Li Fan sighed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The cave where you obtained the technique, is also..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head and stopped abruptly.</p><p></p><p>Solemnly he said, "Since you are also practicing the 'Sitting on the Mountain Technique', you naturally know that the essence of the technique lies in the four words 'sit and enjoy the success.'"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued, "But the changes in the world take thousands of years. Relying solely on 'sitting on the mountain' makes the cultivation process too slow. To be honest, it may not even be considered a third-rate technique."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao became even more convinced.</p><p></p><p>"So, if you want to cultivate the 'Sitting on the Mountain Technique' quickly, you have to rely on 'sitting as an immortal'!" Li Fan emphasized.</p><p></p><p>"Assisting fellow cultivators who are in difficulties, once their luck changes and they soar into the sky, their cultivation will advance by leaps and bounds. Naturally, we will also benefit greatly."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, although the feedback from one person may be small, under wide deployment, 'many a mickle makes a muckle,' and 'gathering sand into a tower.' How could cultivation possibly be slow?"</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shifted his tone, "The key lies here. Although there are many cultivators in the world, those who can cultivate step by step from Qi Refinement and Foundation Building to Golden Elixir and Nascent Soul are ultimately only a small part."</p><p></p><p>"If there are no special means, blind investment will not only be inefficient but in most cases will also be useless."</p><p></p><p>"I think this is the reason why your cultivation has been so slow."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao nodded quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, finding the right person is key."</p><p></p><p>"The so-called resonance between heaven and man. If there are extraordinary talents, the heavens and the earth will surely respond."</p><p></p><p>"My Tianji Sect has a secret technique that can locate and find various extraordinary talents in the world based on the changes in the qi between heaven and earth in advance."</p><p></p><p>"If we bestow favors on them before they grow up..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's voice trailed off, but He Zhenghao listened with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"In this way, the cultivation of the 'Sitting on the Mountain Technique' will surely advance hundreds or even thousands of times faster!"</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful, wonderful!" He looked intoxicated, as if he had fallen into his own beautiful fantasy.</p><p></p><p>But it was Li Fan's cold snort that brought him back to reality.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I've already told you the answers you wanted. When are you going to switch techniques?"</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, with the 'Great Original True Scripture of the Highest Heaven' Transformative Chapter, it should not have much impact on you." Li Fan inquired.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's expression slightly froze, feeling somewhat embarrassed. "The contribution points required for the technique I want to switch to, called the 'Mountain and River Hidden Dragon Technique,' amount to a total of two hundred and fifty thousand..."</p><p></p><p></p><p>He spoke rapidly, revealing his bottom line.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Li Fan's eyes showed a hint of darkness.</p><p></p><p>"How many contribution points have you saved up now?"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"I usually keep a little over a thousand contribution points on hand for emergencies, and the rest are invested through various channels."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao took out a Tianxuan small mirror, glanced at it, and his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"When all added up, it should be around sixteen... fifteen thousand." He said, then cautiously glanced at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, Li Fan did not show anger.</p><p></p><p>Rather, he nodded and said, "Hmm, you are still short of a hundred thousand contribution points."</p><p></p><p>"Give yourself a month, you should be able to make up for it."</p><p></p><p>With that, he flicked his finger.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao felt a cold breath penetrating his body. When he tried to sense it further, he found nothing.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said coldly, "This is my Tianji Sect's secret technique, the 'Spiritual Lock.' Apart from the one cursed, no one can undo it."</p><p></p><p>"When the time comes, if the Spiritual Lock is not removed, you will only perish, body and soul!"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's face turned pale at his words.</p><p></p><p>"Boy, remember! Within a month, change your cultivation technique willingly. Otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced at He Zhenghao and was about to fly away.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao couldn't help but lament, "Senior is really too demanding! From fifteen to twenty-five thousand within a month! How is that possible! It's better to kill..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly turned back and landed in front of He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you so noisy? I've already shown you great mercy by giving you such a long time."</p><p></p><p>"If you can't make it from fifteen thousand to twenty-five thousand in a month, why bother investing?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sounded impatient.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao stammered, looking like he dared not speak his mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was instantly furious, "What's with that expression of yours?"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao had to force himself to say, "It's not that the junior is excusing himself, it's just..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan waved his hand, "You're really in a hopeless situation. Such a simple matter is as difficult as asking for your life."</p><p></p><p>"If I were to take action, I wouldn't need a month. I could settle it in only seven or eight days."</p><p></p><p>The expression on He Zhenghao's face said it all.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sneered, "What? Do you not believe me?"</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, shall we make a bet?"</p><p></p><p>For once, He Zhenghao showed some resolve, "Let's bet! But if Senior loses, you can't go back on your word!"</p>

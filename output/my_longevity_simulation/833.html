        <h1>Chapter 833</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"First, we need to figure out what's going on with that arrow." </p><p></p><p>Not long after, Li Fan, having made up his mind, conducted a search through his avatar Ji Shaoli and found the answer by offering a hefty reward.</p><p></p><p>"The Patrolling Heaven Arrow. One of the latest developments of the Wanxian Alliance to deal with the major offensive from the Five Elders Association."</p><p></p><p>"Its speed is unimaginably fast. It can almost complete a patrol around the Wanxian Alliance's territory in just one day. It also automatically locks onto suspicious targets, descending from the sky and causing devastating strikes."</p><p></p><p>"It can almost instantly kill those below the Hedao realm. Even Hedao cultivators will suffer severe injuries on the spot if caught off guard."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully read the information about the Patrolling Heaven Arrow, his expression solemn.</p><p></p><p>"The key point is that this thing can be mass-produced. It is speculated that there are currently at least five Patrolling Heaven Arrows constantly patrolling the airspace of the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"If used in wartime, it's feared that dozens of arrows could be fired simultaneously, creating an absolute advantage in the aerial environment."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but frown.</p><p></p><p>The power of this Patrolling Heaven Arrow was indeed a bit too formidable. If it weren't for Tian Yang and Lin Ling's protection this time, he would have likely perished on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as a key weapon of war, the Patrolling Heaven Arrow had an immunity clause. </p><p></p><p>In other words, if you were unlucky enough to be right in the flight path of a Patrolling Heaven Arrow and got pierced through, dying an untimely death...</p><p></p><p>No one would be held responsible for your demise.</p><p></p><p>Even if you died, it would be in vain.</p><p></p><p>"From this perspective, it seems Ou Daozi and his son have nothing to do with this Patrolling Heaven Arrow."</p><p></p><p>"They simply predicted the trajectory of the Patrolling Heaven Arrow, wanting to kill someone with a borrowed knife and take the opportunity to escape."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded to himself.</p><p></p><p>After understanding the general situation, Li Fan began his plan.</p><p></p><p>Ou Daozi and his son probably never imagined that Li Fan's retaliation would come so quickly.</p><p></p><p>And it was completely unreasonable!</p><p></p><p>In just three days, a video spread throughout nearly the entire Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The unimaginable content in the video not only shocked countless cultivators in the Wanxian Alliance, but also stirred up killing intent and greed in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>That's right, Li Fan directly gave up on the idea of finding Ou Daozi and his son alone.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he directly publicized the fact that they possessed a supreme magical treasure!</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, the human heart is always greedy and selfish.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning that the other party has a peerless treasure on them, one would definitely try every means to take it for themselves.</p><p></p><p>Secretly scheming alone, the fewer people who know the better.</p><p></p><p>Even if one's abilities are insufficient and help is needed, or if one simply sells the secret for a good price...</p><p></p><p>In any case, this matter should only circulate within a small scope.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan didn't follow the routine at all. Without the slightest hesitation or greed, he made the matter known to everyone in just a few days!</p><p></p><p>There are so many cultivators in the world! Even if the secret on Ou Daozi and his son changed hands, it would definitely have nothing to do with Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Just to vent his anger, he even gave up the opportunity to profit from it...</p><p></p><p>It was truly unwise and could be called crazy behavior.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if it weren't for [Huan Zhen], Li Fan definitely wouldn't have done this.</p><p></p><p>But with Huan Zhen, there was no urgency to obtain anything in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>"The kid is indeed troublesome. Let the cultivators of the Immortal Alliance explore for me..."</p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Scout the way and see if there are any good strategies to capture them."</p><p></p><p>"In the next life, I will follow suit." Li Fan's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan's plan can be said to be quite effective.</p><p></p><p>Foresee the future, the art of reversing time!</p><p></p><p>Anyone who has seen the abilities displayed by Ou Daozi and his son in the video cannot help but be moved and want to make them their own!</p><p></p><p>For a while, within the Wanxian Alliance, a frenzy of searching for Ou Daozi was set off.</p><p></p><p>Several families even offered heavy rewards. As long as they provided information on the whereabouts of Ou Daozi and his son, there would be generous rewards of the highest level Dao techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you can run, the world is vast, but there is no place for you to stay." Li Fan, who personally created all this, watched the cultivators who were gradually going crazy, thinking of the somewhat mocking expression of Ou Daozi's son, and snorted coldly in his heart.</p><p></p><p>When almost all the cultivators of the Wanxian Alliance joined forces to do the same thing.</p><p></p><p>How terrifying would the efficiency be?</p><p></p><p>The answer had already been given in the process of exploring the white fog and the small cave heaven world in the 115th generation.</p><p></p><p>Less than five days after the video was released, Ou Daozi and his son, who were hiding in the deep forest, were found.</p><p></p><p>Although they managed to escape again by using strange means.</p><p></p><p>But since they had already appeared, under the watchful eyes and pursuit of the cultivators of the Immortal Alliance, the distance between them and being captured was certainly not far.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Li Fan a little was that the father and son persisted longer than expected.</p><p></p><p>And in this process, their abilities and information were slowly probed.</p><p></p><p>Ou Daozi's son was named Ou Shangtian.</p><p></p><p>Predicting the future and reversing the universe were all Ou Shangtian's personal abilities.</p><p></p><p>At present, it is speculated that it most likely comes from Ou Shangtian's companion artifact.</p><p></p><p>Not all the details of the future can be predicted. It seems that only when life is under major threat will Ou Shangtian have a premonition.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, he can foresee his countless ways of death.</p><p></p><p>Thus avoiding misfortune and finding a way to survive.</p><p></p><p>As for reversing the universe, it is consistent with Li Fan's guess. It is not really able to reverse time, but only to reverse the state of objects and energy to a certain time before. And in this process, a mysterious connection can be formed between oneself and the object.</p><p></p><p>For example, Ou Shangtian once reversed dozens of attacks launched against him.</p><p></p><p>And he even mastered the ability of one of them, turned around and wiped out the surrounding cultivators, and left proudly.</p><p></p><p>But the power to reverse the universe cannot be used without limits. Every time it is released, Ou Shangtian has to rest for a period of time before he can continue to use it.</p><p></p><p>After the truth was revealed, many cultivators were greatly disappointed. They gave up the pursuit of Ou Shangtian.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, although these two abilities are very strong. But there is still a lot of difference from the imagined power of reversing time.</p><p></p><p>However, there are still a considerable number of cultivators who are continuing.</p><p></p><p>After all, cultivators with such talents in the past were all absorbed by major forces and held in high esteem. The current opportunity to beat a drowning dog is very rare.</p><p></p><p>Knowing Ou Shangtian's specific abilities, the cultivators cooperated very tacitly in the subsequent pursuit process.</p><p></p><p>When planning, they do not go for the kill, but only seek to capture alive.</p><p></p><p>This invalidated most of Ou Shangtian's predictive ability.</p><p></p><p>Instead of making a move at the same time, they adopted a continuous wheel war. Consuming the power of reversing the universe...</p><p></p><p>Gradually, it became more and more difficult for Ou Shangtian to escape.</p>

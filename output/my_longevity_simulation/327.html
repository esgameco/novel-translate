        <div class="content">
            <p>"This is an unavoidable accident. Who would have thought that this slightly crazy old man would have a connection with a broken sword in the distant Congyun Sea?"</p><p></p><p>Carefully recalling every moment of his recent interaction with the fisherman, Li Fan realized that although the fisherman's sudden appearance had startled him, the level of danger during the entire encounter was vastly different compared to his previous experience with the Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>Even the oppressive feeling the black-robed Hedao from Yuandao Prefecture gave Li Fan far exceeded that of the old fisherman.</p><p></p><p>Was the fisherman's strength inferior to that black-robed Hedao?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't think so.</p><p></p><p>As the master of the Tiansha Sword, his strength must be far beyond ordinary Hedao cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Even if he had become crazy and lost his memory for some unknown reason, he absolutely could not be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>But the feeling he gave Li Fan was so unique.</p><p></p><p>During their interactions, there was no sense at all of communicating with a powerful Hedao immortal.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it felt like talking with an ordinary and amiable elder.</p><p></p><p>Apart from his own psychological factors, he didn't feel the slightest bit of pressure.</p><p></p><p>The reason for this...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Old Fisherman has also forgotten the fact that he is an extremely powerful expert?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a vague feeling in his heart that this might indeed be the case.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps there were still other secrets behind this, but it should be more or less like this.</p><p></p><p>"An expert of Old Fisherman's level, wandering around crazily in the territory of the Wanxian Alliance, can be said to be extremely dangerous."</p><p></p><p>"If he suddenly goes berserk and runs amok, the destruction caused may be no less than another Tianling Prefecture war."</p><p></p><p>"Even so, the Wanxian Alliance actually let him be and didn't expel him."</p><p></p><p>"There should be some deeper reason behind this."</p><p></p><p>"The waters are too deep. Before I grow stronger, it's best for me to avoid contact with him as much as possible."</p><p></p><p>As his thoughts gradually calmed down, Li Fan looked again at the still unconscious female cultivator from the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Her face was pretty. Although she couldn't be called a stunning beauty, she was definitely a beauty.</p><p></p><p>Judging from her appearance, she looked quite young, but a cultivator's looks actually had little to do with their age.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps she was even a bit older than Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Because Li Fan actually couldn't sense this woman's specific cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>This meant that either she had a treasure protecting her body and concealing her aura, or her strength far surpassed Li Fan's, at least at the Yuanyingn or Huashen stage.</p><p></p><p>"This woman will be of great use to me? What does that mean?"</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what the fisherman had seen, but he probably wouldn't say that without reason.</p><p></p><p>Capturing the female cultivator, Li Fan quietly left this hollowed out mountain.</p><p></p><p>After flying for a while, he arrived at an empty space in the forest and put the female cultivator down.</p><p></p><p>Then he wanted to wake her up.</p><p></p><p>However, after trying several methods, Li Fan actually failed to succeed.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that slap from the fisherman was really heavy."</p><p></p><p>Without figuring out the female cultivator's identity, Li Fan didn't act rashly.</p><p></p><p>He just quietly guarded by the side.</p><p></p><p>While cultivating, he waited for her to wake up.</p><p></p><p>A full two days later, the female cultivator let out a moan and finally regained consciousness.</p><p></p><p>She sat up straight on the ground, looking a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>Glancing around, she saw Li Fan sitting quietly to the side and seemed a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>"You are..."</p><p></p><p>"I am Li..." Before Li Fan could finish answering.</p><p></p><p>This female cultivator seemed to suddenly remember something, and a look of horror appeared on her face.</p><p></p><p>Letting out a scream, she actually forgot to stand up, but directly used her hands to support her body and kept scooting backwards.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she kept saying, "Don't come near me!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face darkened and he immediately swallowed the words that were about to leave his mouth.</p><p></p><p>With a solemn expression, he used a bit of spiritual power, his voice like thunder, and said coldly, "Fellow Daoist, please calm down!"</p><p></p><p>The female cultivator indeed stopped moving and froze in place.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the expression on her face became even more terrified for some reason.</p><p></p><p>"It seems she shouldn't be someone with profound cultivation." Li Fan made a judgment in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Trying his best to put on a gentle face, Li Fan asked softly, "May I ask how to address Fellow Daoist? And why were you captured by that Old Fisherman?"</p><p></p><p>The female cultivator showed an expression uglier than crying, looking extremely unwilling.</p><p></p><p>But her mouth opened and closed, constantly saying, "My name is Lu Xuejing. I had heard rumors about Old Fisherman before and was very interested in them."</p><p></p><p>"Not long ago, I happened to hear that he appeared near Tianyu Prefecture. My mother has been busy with official duties recently and has loosened her control over me."</p><p></p><p>"So I secretly slipped out to find Old Fisherman."</p><p></p><p>"I happened to see a cultivator use a tattered iron piece to exchange for a cultivation technique."</p><p></p><p>"I became interested and also wanted to try."</p><p></p><p>"Who knew that old fellow actually ignored me. I got so angry that I cursed at him."</p><p></p><p>"Then..."</p><p></p><p>"I blacked out and seemed to be trapped in a small, dark place."</p><p></p><p>Lu Xuejing's face was extremely aggrieved, and two lines of tears flowed down.</p><p></p><p>Her body trembled slightly, as if she was sobbing.</p><p></p><p>But her speech was still very steady.</p><p></p><p>"When I woke up, I appeared here."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan saw Lu Xuejing's strange and contradictory performance.</p><p></p><p>He muttered in his heart, "I just asked casually, but you're telling me so much detail."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, as if thinking of something, Li Fan's expression couldn't help but become a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>"I won't take your things for nothing."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I seem to have something here that will be of great use to you."</p><p></p><p>Old Fisherman's words echoed in his ears. In order to verify his guess, Li Fan spoke up, "Fellow Daoist, stand up."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lu Xuejing indeed stood up.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, then asked, "Fellow Daoist, how old are you now? What's your cultivation level? What cultivation technique do you practice?"</p><p></p><p>Asking a stranger these two questions was obviously an extremely rude thing to do.</p><p></p><p>Just leaving with a sleeve wave was already very restrained. Drawing a sword on the spot was also possible.</p><p></p><p>But Lu Xuejing still didn't know how to refuse and answered Li Fan's questions without hurry.</p><p></p><p>"I'm twenty-three years old this year, at the late Foundation Establishment stage. I cultivate the 'Two Qi Illuminating the Gods and Extinguishing All Heavens Technique' prepared for me by my mother."</p><p></p><p>The questions were answered truthfully, but the look of trepidation on Lu Xuejing's face became more and more obvious.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she looked at Li Fan, a flash of resentment passing through her pupils.</p><p></p><p>The instant he heard the name of the cultivation technique, Li Fan's heart jumped slightly.</p><p></p><p>Then he understood, "So she's an immortal second generation who hasn't experienced much of the world's dangers. She went out to play, disrespected the fisherman, and was captured."</p><p></p><p>"Afterwards, she was treated as an object and traded to me."</p><p></p><p>"In other words, this immortal second generation now belongs to me?"</p>

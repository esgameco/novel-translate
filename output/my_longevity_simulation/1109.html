        <h1>Chapter 1109</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1107: A Plan to Disrupt the World</p><p></p><p>The allure of a true immortal is simply too fatal for cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the immortal path was severed, achieving immortality has become an impossible dream for cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But now, suddenly, the remains of a true immortal have appeared in the world.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, all signs indicate that these remains are very likely to be genuine!</p><p></p><p>At this point, no matter how much doubt they harbor in their hearts, the choice made by the cultivators is to first obtain these remains and then figure things out.</p><p></p><p>Even if it's not the remains of a true immortal, judging from the various anomalies it has caused, the benefits gained will be no small matter!</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance left the celestial cities where they resided and searched everywhere for traces of the true immortal's remains.</p><p></p><p>Even quite a few Five Elders Society cultivators who were shopping in the Nine Mountains State traveled thousands of miles to join in the excitement.</p><p></p><p>With the establishment and development of the Nine Mountains Free Trade State, the Myriad Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Society have maintained peace for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The relationship between the two sides has further eased. As long as they apply, cultivators from both sides can visit the other side for tourism.</p><p></p><p>It seems they intend to prove through this method that they are more suitable for cultivators' survival than the other side.</p><p></p><p>However, there have been no reports of anyone being able to change their allegiance.</p><p></p><p>The exchanges between the two sides are still at the most superficial stage.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Immortals Alliance cultivators are mostly wary of these Five Elders Society members.</p><p></p><p>While searching for the true immortal's remains in groups, they try to stay away and be on guard.</p><p></p><p>"Say, could this true immortal's remains be a ploy by the Five Elders Society? Deliberately stirring us up into chaos. We're all just thinking about doing business now, and our vigilance against the Five Elders Society is decreasing year by year. Alas, this is not a good thing."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, who knows if one day they will suddenly attack again! The Five Elders Society is no good!"</p><p></p><p>"What are you thinking? Those inexplicably appearing world souls were also arranged by the Five Elders Society? This is on our Myriad Immortals Alliance's turf. We ourselves don't even know about the existence of these world souls. If the Five Elders Society could know so clearly, we might as well surrender early!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The occasional appearance of Five Elders Society cultivators did not affect the Myriad Immortals Alliance's pursuit of the true immortal's remains.</p><p></p><p>With the emergence of the second lucky individual, their desire grew even stronger.</p><p></p><p>The second fortunate cultivator who had close contact with the true immortal's remains was named Xue Mu.</p><p></p><p>He was a Foundation Establishment formation master.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he never truly touched the true immortal's remains, only being blocked by the golden light surrounding it.</p><p></p><p>But the moment the golden light entered his body, countless bizarre and unimaginable formations instantly flashed through Xue Mu's mind.</p><p></p><p>That vast amount of data almost burst his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>At the critical moment of life and death, Xue Mu subconsciously let go. The true immortal's remains then escaped again.</p><p></p><p>But Xue Mu, who missed this great opportunity, was not regretful at all. Instead, after being dazed for a long time, his face showed ecstatic joy as he laughed loudly towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Later, everyone learned that in that seemingly brief instant, he obtained at least hundreds of formations from the true immortal's remains.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps even the current strongest grand formation of the Myriad Immortals Alliance is far incomparable to any single one in his mind!</p><p></p><p>Although his cultivation did not improve, for the formation master Xue Mu, the harvest this time was far more important than advancing his cultivation by several major realms!</p><p></p><p>Soon, Xue Mu was dispatched by the Formation Hall headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The person was taken away.</p><p></p><p>And the internal news that came out soon after confirmed the advanced nature of the formation obtained in his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Apart from true immortals, what other existence could have such abilities?</p><p></p><p>This undoubtedly substantiated the rumors of a true immortal's remains.</p><p></p><p>After the news spread, some people in the Myriad Immortal Alliance finally couldn't sit still.</p><p></p><p>In the Lingmu Realm, Li Fan connected with the messenger Zhou.</p><p></p><p>"Recently, the matter of the true immortal's remains has caused quite a stir. What does fellow Daoist think about it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quickly gave a reply, firmly stating, "It's purely fictitious and just a rumor! Fellow Daoist Zhou, don't believe it at all!"</p><p></p><p>"You're so sure?" Now it was messenger Zhou's turn to be a little suspicious.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sneered, "The immortal path has been severed for so many years, and none of our colleagues from various realms have ever seen the remains of a true immortal."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"It's the same. How could it be so coincidental that it suddenly appeared out of nowhere? And it instantly became known to everyone. I think there must be someone behind the scenes pulling the strings!" Li Fan said with certainty.</p><p></p><p>"But the accompanying spirit of heaven and earth that appeared is indeed genuine. Even two people in the Immortal Alliance have successfully advanced to the Merged Dao realm because of it. I really can't think of any force in the Xuanhuang Realm that could so casually take out so many Merged Dao resources and use them as bait," messenger Zhou refuted instead of believing Li Fan's words.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan seemed to be stumped as well.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, he sighed, "The more it is like this, the more it shows that the other party has great intentions! Your Myriad Immortal Alliance is reaping the benefits, while we are living in fear."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, messenger Zhou suddenly asked, "Is it really not your handiwork?"</p><p></p><p>"What kind of talk is this! Our Myriad Realms United Association has been lying low for many years, how could we suddenly stir up trouble like this?" Li Fan's tone was a little displeased.</p><p></p><p>"In my opinion, it might be an enemy of your Myriad Immortal Alliance instead. Ruling the Xuanhuang Realm for thousands of years, haven't you had any mortal enemies?"</p><p></p><p>"Hm?!" Li Fan's words seemed to remind him of something.</p><p></p><p>Messenger Zhou was a little startled, and after a brief silence, he hastily ended the communication.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a mysterious expression finally appeared on Li Fan's face.</p><p></p><p>Without saying much, all this turmoil was naturally Li Fan's doing.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the dark power of the black puppet, the true immortal's remains were able to shuttle back and forth between various places, appearing and disappearing mysteriously, escaping the pursuit of countless cultivators.</p><p></p><p>And by secretly distorting the Heavenly Dao's decree, Li Fan instructed the spirits of heaven and earth to actively appear one by one. Li Fan also made this play more realistic.</p><p></p><p>As for the two beneficiaries of this incident, Zhang Haobo and Xue Mu. Although they had nothing to do with him in this life, they were all acquaintances from his past reincarnation experiences.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't mind, and incidentally did a good deed to help them.</p><p></p><p>However, as he falsely spread the Heavenly Mandate everywhere, the tolerance and vigilance of the Xuanhuang Realm had almost reached its limit.</p><p></p><p>Next, he might have to lie low for a while.</p><p></p><p>"The situation is set, and I'm not afraid of them not entering the game. Such a chaotic situation should be able to conceal my true intentions," Li Fan laughed in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"But messenger Zhou's reaction at the end was a bit strange. What did she think of?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Myriad Immortal Alliance really has an enemy who can use several Merged Dao advancement resources as bait?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Li Fan couldn't help but frown.</p>

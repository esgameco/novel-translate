        <h1>Chapter 822</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>As soon as Pei Tuo said these words, the other people present were instantly shocked. At the same time, they had a sudden realization in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Pei Tuo had just lost his composure like that. It turned out that what Ji Shaoli had promised was actually an ownerless Nascent Soul cave abode!</p><p></p><p>You should know that for a Golden Core cultivator to advance to the Nascent Soul realm, they must have a cave abode.</p><p></p><p>Each ownerless cave abode almost represents a Nascent Soul cultivator who is about to rise.</p><p></p><p>The value is immeasurable.</p><p></p><p>Apart from relying on those illustrious immortal alliance families, one has to completely rely on their own luck to find one.</p><p></p><p>Difficult, difficult, difficult!</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Immortal Alliance has countless Foundation Establishment and Golden Core cultivators, like crops in the ground, changing batch after batch.</p><p></p><p>As for Nascent Soul cultivators, they can already be considered to have entered the inner circle, holding important positions in various states.</p><p></p><p>They are completely the backbone of the immortal alliance.</p><p></p><p>The difference of one realm can be said to be earth-shattering.</p><p></p><p>It's just...</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli himself is only at the Golden Core realm, yet he provides information about ownerless cave abodes to members of the mutual aid society?</p><p></p><p>Is this possible?</p><p></p><p>The people present all couldn't help but have a trace of doubt flash through their hearts.</p><p></p><p>It's not that they are overly suspicious.</p><p></p><p>It's just that this matter...</p><p></p><p>It's a bit unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that Ji Shaoli is just a lonely person without any powerful backing.</p><p></p><p>Even if he were a member of some mysterious organization.</p><p></p><p>With an ownerless cave abode in hand, those willing to follow him would surely be countless.</p><p></p><p>So why bother coming to this Congyu Sea to recruit?</p><p></p><p>Could it be the Five Elders Society?</p><p></p><p>As soon as this thought emerged, the crowd, who had calmed down from their initial excitement, couldn't help but be startled. The more they thought about it, the more anxious they became in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>And Ji Shaoli naturally saw what these people were thinking.</p><p></p><p>He smiled faintly: "You don't need to worry too much. I'm definitely not some Five Elders Society spy."</p><p></p><p>"The ownerless cave abode prepared for Pei Tuo is also within the Myriad Immortal Alliance's territory."</p><p></p><p>The crowd then breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"It's very normal for you to have doubts when the [Mutual Aid Society] is first established. But facts speak louder than words. Once Pei Tuo achieves the Nascent Soul realm, all doubts will naturally collapse," Ji Shaoli said with full confidence.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli lightly clapped his hands, and after a moment, the image of a faceless stone statue suddenly appeared in the banquet hall of this cave mansion.</p><p></p><p>"This is the true immortal of [Relieving Suffering and Difficulties, Compassion in the Mortal World]. You only need to sincerely pray to it and silently recite the oath of joining the society to complete the joining ceremony," Ji Shaoli introduced with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Afterwards, I will transfer the contribution points to you." </p><p></p><p>"It's that simple?" Xiang Xin was a bit skeptical.</p><p></p><p>"It is that simple. Our mutual aid society doesn't engage in any mysticism," Ji Shaoli said with certainty.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone couldn't help but look towards the faceless stone statue in the air.</p><p></p><p>It seemed there was nothing mysterious about it, only vaguely sensing some inexplicable aura from it.</p><p></p><p>Telling of the extraordinariness of this statue.</p><p></p><p>With the temptation of an ownerless cave abode, Pei Tuo naturally had no fear and was the first to step forward and silently recite in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>He raised his head: "That's it?"</p><p></p><p>It seemed nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>"That's it. Welcome to officially joining the [Mutual Aid Society]." Ji Shaoli showed an enthusiastic smile.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other few people also followed suit one after another.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the first batch of six cultivators had completed their registration for the Mutual Aid Society.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli also kept his word and immediately transferred 100,000 contribution points to each of them.</p><p></p><p>When they truly confirmed through the Heavenly Profound Mirror on the island that they had received this huge sum of contributions</p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>They all looked somewhat dazed, as if in a dream.</p><p></p><p>"The members of the mutual aid society are about quality, not quantity. So please don't intentionally promote it. Of course, if you have exceptionally talented relatives and friends, you can also take the initiative to introduce them to join," Ji Shaoli reminded them again before sending them off.</p><p></p><p>After the group left, Ji Shaoli finally turned around and looked at the somewhat impatient Bei Tuo.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what Brother Bei's foundation-building treasure and golden core method are? And what kind of Nascent Soul cultivation technique are you preparing to practice?" Ji Shaoli suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>Bei Tuo hesitated for only a moment before telling him everything.</p><p></p><p>"I used the 'Solid Rock Wall' to establish my foundation, and the three methods of protection, life, and earth to form my golden core."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli first praised him, saying, "The foundation-building treasure and golden core method mutually reinforce each other. Fellow Daoist, you are truly extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for the other party to respond, he immediately followed up with another question: "I happen to know of a place, the 'Thousand Rock Grotto-Heaven', which is very compatible with your Dao path."</p><p></p><p>"What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>"Thousand Rock Grotto-Heaven? This is naturally excellent." Upon hearing this, Bei Tuo was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>However, immediately after, he repeatedly realized something, and his body suddenly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Ji Shaoli not far away, and the shock in his heart was already difficult to describe in words.</p><p></p><p>To be able to cultivate alone all the way to the perfection of the golden core stage.</p><p></p><p>Bei Tuo was definitely not a foolish person.</p><p></p><p>He keenly noticed some things that were amiss.</p><p></p><p>Happening to know of a 'Thousand Rock Grotto-Heaven' that was extremely compatible with himself...</p><p></p><p>How could there be so many coincidences!</p><p></p><p>You should know that the grotto-heavens devoured by the vast majority of Nascent Soul cultivators in the world are very difficult to match with their own foundation-building and golden core methods.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was already a great blessing to find a grotto-heaven to form a Nascent Soul.</p><p></p><p>Except for the core disciples of those illustrious families, who could afford to be picky?</p><p></p><p>But oddly enough, the one prepared by Ji Shaoli for him was almost tailor-made...</p><p></p><p>Either it was a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>Or it meant...</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli knew of not just one, but even many different grotto-heavens.</p><p></p><p>After learning about his cultivation path, he immediately selected the most suitable one.</p><p></p><p>What did this imply?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps only the top few forces of the Immortal Alliance could do this.</p><p></p><p>A sense of coldness surged in Bei Tuo's heart.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the image of that 'Faceless Stone Statue' once again surfaced.</p><p></p><p>The true immortal of 'Relieving Suffering, Saving Hardship, and Compassion in the Mortal World'.</p><p></p><p>Just as Bei Tuo was feeling uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli spoke again: "Brother Bei, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>"If there are no objections, then let's set off now."</p><p></p><p>Bei Tuo hastily agreed.</p><p></p><p>Next, the two of them first arrived at Wanxian Island via a teleportation array.</p><p></p><p>Then they proceeded all the way towards the hinterland of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>This slightly reduced the worry in Bei Tuo's heart.</p><p></p><p>"At the very least, it definitely won't be from the Five Elders Council," he thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Arriving in Gufeng Prefecture and exiting the floating celestial city.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli used a secret technique to conceal their whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>Then they quickly traveled to a desolate desert.</p><p></p><p>After looking around to ensure there were no cultivators nearby.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli pointed to the sky and quietly transmitted a message: "The Thousand Rock Grotto-Heaven is right here."</p><p></p><p>Bei Tuo was slightly stunned, then flew to the location Ji Shaoli pointed to and carefully sensed it.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he indeed sensed the existence of an ownerless grotto-heaven and was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he couldn't hide the shock in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"You can ascend here."</p><p></p><p>"I will protect you."</p>

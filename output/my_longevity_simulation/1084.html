        <h1>Chapter 1084</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke tightly gripped the Beast Turning Wheel in his hand, not daring to relax his spirit for a moment. </p><p></p><p>After a while, the restless beast troops finally calmed down slowly. It was not due to Xu Ke's credit, but because Emperor San Mao had appeared.</p><p></p><p>Interestingly, at the Sacred Beast Conference on Nanming Mountain, when Emperor San Mao was mentioned, these beasts all sneered at him without exception, calling him a traitor to the beast race who deserved to be executed by all beasts. But at this moment when Emperor San Mao really appeared, the beasts present were as silent as cicadas in winter, and not one dared to speak loudly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke raised his doubts in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Xuan Niao, how come I feel that in the eyes of these guys, Grandpa San seems to be even more terrifying than Emperor Yi?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and said, "Emperor Yi, as the emperor of beasts, has to consider the entire beast race and mete out rewards and punishments appropriately. Under normal circumstances, as long as you don't anger him, there is no real danger. But this Emperor San Mao in front of us has openly betrayed the beasts and defected to the humans."</p><p></p><p>"Not only is this traitor to the beast race living well, he even helped human cultivators establish the Beast Taming Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"Guess who has killed more beasts over the years, Emperor Yi or Emperor San Mao?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke immediately fell into deep thought. Then glancing at the kind-looking white-haired elder, he couldn't help but shudder.</p><p></p><p>With Emperor San Mao personally suppressing them, this beast troop naturally became obedient on the surface.</p><p></p><p>However, Emperor San Mao did not excessively force these beasts to join the Beast Taming Sect and be enslaved by human cultivators.</p><p></p><p>He just cordoned off a large area on the Beast Taming Sect's territory to temporarily provide a dwelling for these beasts. </p><p></p><p>Although it was a bit crowded, there was no problem with survival.</p><p></p><p>After hearing Xu Ke recount the course of events, Emperor San Mao asked, "What was your reason for saying those words to Emperor Yi?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke was well prepared and said calmly, "Emperor Yi said that a great calamity is coming to the Xuanhuang Realm, so he plans to split the realm and leave. But while he can escape, we cannot. In order to deal with the calamity, we must unite all forces that can be united. With the strength of this beast troop joining us, at least the possibility of our Beast Taming Sect surviving the calamity will be much greater."</p><p></p><p>Emperor San Mao pondered in silence.</p><p></p><p>These words did not seem like something a young boy could come up with. But Emperor San Mao had lived for too long and had long since stopped judging one's wisdom solely by their age.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, he said indifferently, "Since you brought this trouble, I'll leave it to you to handle completely. If any of these beasts stir up trouble and break the sect rules in the future, I'll hold you accountable."</p><p></p><p>With that said, Emperor San Mao also tossed over a round disk.</p><p></p><p>It was not much different from the one Emperor Yi had bestowed upon Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>Except the beast patterns carved on it were even more rich and vivid.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"The sect's supreme treasure, the Beast Turning Wheel?" Xu Ke quickly recognized the treasure Emperor San Mao handed to him and subconsciously gripped it tightly.</p><p></p><p>Before he could say anything more, Emperor San Mao's figure had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"This treasure was handed to me so easily?" Xu Ke looked completely at a loss, feeling it was incredibly unreal.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan secretly compared the two different Beast Turning Wheels.</p><p></p><p>The one gifted by Emperor Yi, although the beast patterns on it only included...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The types of beasts were diverse, but the suppression of demon beasts was even stronger. Even the strongest among them, comparable to human immortal realm cultivators like Chi Jiutou, had their life and death determined by a single thought of the Beast Dharma Wheel holder. This was determined by the characteristics of the demon beast clan in the Xuanhuang Realm, all of which were differentiated from the Emperor One.</p><p></p><p>As for the Beast Control Dharma Wheel of Emperor San Mo, it seemed to include all the demon beasts in the world except for the imperial beasts. However, the ability to control the demon beasts was relatively weaker. After all, the wise and prophetic could only give specific suggestions, but could not determine the choice of direction.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if the memories related to cultivation techniques and divine powers will be lost after coming out of this trial illusion of the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate."</p><p></p><p>"If the techniques of these two Beast Dharma Wheels can be absorbed and transformed, perhaps the empire can really cultivate atavistic demon beasts."</p><p></p><p>Exotic beasts were derived from demon beasts, and all the demon beasts in the world had a common ancestor. So in fact, every exotic beast contained complete demon beast bloodline information.</p><p></p><p>The refinement of the fusion beast that resembled the Emperor One was based on this conjecture.</p><p></p><p>However, with too little information about ancient demon beasts, it was impossible to carry out targeted demon beast atavism experiments. Otherwise, it might not be difficult to recreate the situation of ancient demon beasts rampaging.</p><p></p><p>"In any case, let's record them well first."</p><p></p><p>The information contained in the two Beast Dharma Wheels was too complex. Even with Li Fan's current abilities, it was very difficult to fully grasp them. Moreover, perhaps because they were not native to Xuanhuang, the Beast Dharma Wheel information in this illusion seemed to be missing compared to the actual objects.</p><p></p><p>But that didn't stop Li Fan from occupying the two Beast Dharma Wheels at all times.</p><p></p><p>Next, the plot of "The Change of the Beast Taming Sect" began to deviate from what had happened before.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke no longer received the task of going to the Divine Brush Sect to find the Rift Whale, but instead focused on dealing with the group of demon beasts within the sect.</p><p></p><p>"Uniting all forces that can be united" should be the content that this second scene needs to test.</p><p></p><p>When a catastrophe descends, as the Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate, one naturally needs to demonstrate the ability to coordinate far beyond ordinary people. The forces within the Xuanhuang Realm were complex and each had their own agenda. But in the end, they all belonged to the human race.</p><p></p><p>The contradictions and conflicts between them were certainly not as great as those between humans and demon beasts.</p><p></p><p>At least that's how it should appear on the surface.</p><p></p><p>If this group of demon beasts and the Beast Taming Sect could be handled well, it seemed that this test could be passed.</p><p></p><p>"Don't always think about suppressing with the Beast Dharma Wheel whenever you encounter difficulties. Convince the beasts with reason..."</p><p></p><p>"What if one day, the Beast Dharma Wheel becomes ineffective, how will you deal with it then?"</p><p></p><p>"In ancient times, there was a sage emperor in the Xuanhuang Realm. Although he had no strength to even tie up a chicken, his words were sincere and he treated people with genuine sincerity. Everyone who talked with him felt refreshed as if in a spring breeze. Both superiors and subordinates respected and submitted to him."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan studied the Beast Dharma Wheels while cultivating to increase his own strength.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he instructed Xu Ke on how to handle and command the group of demon beasts.</p><p></p><p>Compared to humans, demon beasts had fewer tricks up their sleeves. They even appeared much simpler.</p><p></p><p>Under the personal guidance of Li Taishi, Xu Ke only used the power of the Beast Dharma Wheel three times in these years. In the vast majority of situations, he resolved various crises only by words and actions.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he slowly gained the trust of all the demon beasts.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the great tribulation of "the law cannot be cultivated together" finally descended.</p><p></p><p>Because the entire Beast Taming Sect only cultivated one cultivation technique, they could not hold on for long and soon showed signs of collapse.</p><p></p><p>"Such a terrifying tribulation, the law cannot be cultivated together..."</p>

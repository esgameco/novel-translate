        <h1>Chapter 545</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"The celestial official positions that we are so enamored with may not be important to him."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Lord disguises it well, those who truly crave power can be easily spotted."</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan spoke with a profound tone.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, He Zhenghao's expression turned serious, nodding in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"As far as I know, in fact, the Lord of the Secret Envoys was forced to accept the role of acting island lord of the Wanxian Island. Tasked with rebuilding the Immortal City, it was like a duck being forced onto a perch, a necessary but reluctant matter," Gao Yuan suddenly revealed.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was surprised, asking, "Is that so?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan nodded, "Although I don't know all the details, fortunately, the Lord of the Secret Envoys eventually completed this mission."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, he also changed the fate of many of us."</p><p></p><p>"Now, although he holds the position of the Secret Envoy and oversees the political affairs of the entire region of Congyunhai, I speculate that he may not actually be interested in managing every little thing personally."</p><p></p><p>"I also believe that with the Lord's extraordinary talents, wasting time on such mundane matters would be a true waste."</p><p></p><p>"He needs a bigger stage. As for these trivial matters, there are naturally people below to handle them."</p><p></p><p>"What he needs are individuals who can handle everything efficiently in his absence, without him needing to worry too much."</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan analyzed step by step.</p><p></p><p>"The two tasks he assigned to us this time are a test in this regard. New 69 Bookâ†’69shux.com"</p><p></p><p>"And the Splitting Soul Jade Scriptures is a trap."</p><p></p><p>"Once we lose control of the situation and reach the point of needing to seek advice from the Lord of the Secret Envoys..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps there won't be any change in our positions, but in his heart, we will definitely be labeled as incompetent."</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan spoke solemnly.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was startled, "Really?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan coldly hummed, "I don't know if you noticed the way the Lord looks at us."</p><p></p><p>"The look in his eyes, what about it?" He Zhenghao was somewhat puzzled and quickly asked for clarification.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Lord may appear friendly on the surface and sometimes even shows respects to his subordinates, in reality..."</p><p></p><p>A trace of horror flashed in Gao Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"When he looks at all of us, the gaze from deep within his eyes is the same."</p><p></p><p>"It's as if we, all of us cultivators, are like ants in his eyes..."</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not it..." Gao Yuan shook his head, frowning, seemingly searching for the right description.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he suddenly pointed at the tables and chairs in the council chamber, saying in a deep voice, "That's right. In his eyes, all of us are like these, merely tools."</p><p></p><p>"It's as though we're not in the same realm of existence. To him, we are all just simple tools."</p><p></p><p>"When I was still standing guard at the entrance of the Ministry of Government Affairs, I was fortunate enough to see a True Dao Cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"But even if it was a True Dao Immortal, the look in his eyes towards me was not as indifferent as the Lord's..."</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the Lord is a cultivator from the ancient Tianji Sect. Due to some reason, he has been in deep sleep until now, and his cultivation has fallen to the Golden Core realm."</p><p></p><p>"There were rumors before of the Lord killing several Nascent Soul cultivators with his Golden Core cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"So, what was his cultivation level during the ancient peak period?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan's voice grew quieter, and a hint of fear flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao couldn't help but shudder.</p><p></p><p>The implications in Gao Yuan's words were becoming obvious.</p><p></p><p>He suspected that in the ancient times, Li Fan was actually a Longevity Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Because it was widely known that once they entered the Longevity Realm, they truly achieved transcendence.</p><p></p><p>The nature of life also changed, making them entirely different from cultivators in realms like Harmonization, Nascent Soul, or Divine Transformation. </p><p></p><p>Perhaps only a Longevity Supreme could view the world's beings indifferently and equally.</p><p></p><p>Once accepting this viewpoint and combining it with Li Fan's shocking abilities in the past, everything suddenly seemed logical.</p><p></p><p>There are countless cultivators proficient in divination arts in the world, but it has never been heard of anyone like Li Fan, effortlessly using it for profit and doubling assets.</p><p></p><p>If the divination art were truly so magical, then all the cultivators in the world would be fighting to learn it.</p><p></p><p>For thousands of years, the divination arts have been lukewarm for a reason.</p><p></p><p>With the greedy nature of cultivators who seize everything they can, there is no reason for them not to take advantage.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps only a Longevity Supreme who had perfected the divination arts could easily foresee the future.</p><p></p><p>In the underground rumor mill of Congyunhai, there were stories of Wanxian Island suddenly being sealed off, and then the Five Elders Association raiding and seizing the entire island.</p><p></p><p>All of this was due to a prophecy.</p><p></p><p>Although it was said that the renowned Gong Sun Qixuan derived the prophecy.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, if Li Fan was once a Longevity Supreme, then his slaying of Nascent Soul cultivators with a Golden Core cultivation, and using a puppet with Divine Transformation cultivation as a mount...</p><p></p><p>All of this would not matter.</p><p></p><p>If they couldn't do these things, would they still be called Longevity Supremes?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the council hall of the Ministry of Government Affairs, there was an absolute silence for a while.</p><p></p><p>A strange atmosphere was brewing between He Zhenghao and Gao Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The more they thought about it, the more they felt that these speculations were reasonable and well-founded.</p><p></p><p>Thus, their bodies began to tremble uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>One was due to the inherent fear of powerful beings of the Longevity Realm.</p><p></p><p>The other was because...</p><p></p><p>Being taken as a confidant by a Longevity Supreme, even if temporarily, even just outwardly...</p><p></p><p>It was an absolute honor.</p><p></p><p>With their thoughts fluctuating, the two men imagined a lot and could not calm down for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, He Zhenghao broke the silence.</p><p></p><p>He cleared his throat and said softly, "Brother Gao, this matter is all your speculation."</p><p></p><p>"It's best not to easily speak of it to outsiders."</p><p></p><p>"Only you and I know."</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan glanced at He Zhenghao and nodded faintly, "I am well aware of this matter."</p><p></p><p>The two men exchanged a smile, all understood without words.</p><p></p><p>There was still one superficial phrase they didn't say.</p><p></p><p>If Li Fan really was a Longevity Supreme, then serving him now.</p><p></p><p>Once his injuries are fully healed and his cultivation is restored...</p><p></p><p>By that time, their stage would no longer be this small corner of Congyunhai.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao also thought of his wife who had long extinguished the flame of ambition in her eyes, feeling it faintly reignite.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>Deep within the Ministry of Government Affairs.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan withdrew his attention, summoning a water mirror.</p><p></p><p>He touched his chin and gazed at his reflection in the mirror.</p><p></p><p>Eyes that indifferent look at everything...</p><p></p><p>He stared blankly at his own eyes.</p>

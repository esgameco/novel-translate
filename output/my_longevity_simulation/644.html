        <h1>Chapter 644</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Fortunately, since the last attack by the Five Elders on Wanxian Island, the reconstruction and defense level in Yuncheng have been higher than that of the usual fairy cities in the province, enough to be comparable to several central provinces. After the protective formation shone brightly for a while, the crack vanished instantly.</p><p></p><p>Before everyone could relax, the second flow fire collided with the protective light shield again. This time, the intensity was even stronger than before, causing the celestial city in the clouds to sway slightly, as if it would fall from the sky at any moment.</p><p></p><p>What chilled everyone even more was that after the black flow fire burst, it did not completely disappear. Instead, it left behind a sticky black gel-like substance that wriggled and corroded the protective formation. Even from a distance, one could hear the sizzling sound coming from outside the formation.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Heavenly Rebirth Formation of Congyun City is strong, it won't hold for long," Li Fan quickly judged as a formation master.</p><p></p><p>While the formation and the black viscous substance were deadlocked, countless black lights continued to fly towards Congyun Immortal City. Although there were purple lights emitted from the Celestial Figures to strike down some of the flow fires, more were unstoppable and bombarded Congyun City.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Congyun Immortal City looked as precarious as leaves swaying in a storm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Hongxi Immortal Sovereign finally showed his determination as the leader of a province.</p><p></p><p>He transformed into a giant towering figure and intercepted numerous black flow fires, then coldly commanded, "Activate the entire Heavenly Rebirth Formation of Yuncheng, draw power from the surrounding nodes to ensure that Congyun City is in the best state!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he cast a spell and flew towards the highest point of Congyun City.</p><p></p><p>After his words spread throughout Congyun City, there was a sudden silence. While most cultivators did not understand the meaning behind Hongxi Immortal Sovereign's words, those who understood were all pale-faced in that moment.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted his eyes and watched Hongxi with a decisive expression, secretly admiring his boldness.</p><p></p><p>Having studied formations for many lifetimes, Li Fan was well aware of the general defense system of the Wanxian Alliance. Each city would have a protective formation. Within a province, centered around the floating city in the center, there were hundreds of small protective formations that formed a medium-sized formation spanning the province.</p><p></p><p>When all these medium-sized formations within the territories of the Wanxian Alliance were combined, they could form a colossal and terrifying formation that covered almost half of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Layer by layer, the power was infinite!</p><p></p><p>The types of protective formations in the Wanxian Alliance changed every five hundred years. Previously, Li Fan had seen the "Wanli Mountain and River Formation" used on a sunken island. Currently, the Wanxian Alliance was using the "Heavenly Rebirth Formation."</p><p></p><p>Although its protective ability was weaker compared to the Wanli Mountain River Formation, it had an irreplaceable function.</p><p></p><p>That was to absorb the spiritual energy of living beings within the formation to enhance its effectiveness!</p><p></p><p>Hence, Hongxi Immortal Sovereign's intentions were quite clear.</p><p></p><p>By fully activating the Heavenly Rebirth Formation, they would absorb the spiritual energy of the surviving creatures on the islands in Congyun Sea. This was to maintain the safety of the formation in Congyun Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Rationally speaking, this choice was not a problem. In the face of such a catastrophe, apart from the current Congyun City, which could barely resist, all other islands were destined to turn to ashes in an instant. By using the lives of those destined to die to strengthen the formation, it might provide a lifeline for the cultivators in Congyun City.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Being annihilated by the soul of heaven and earth and being slaughtered by their own people were two different matters.</p><p></p><p>Not everyone could make such a cold-blooded decision, treating the lives of their compatriots as nothing.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, after Hongxi Immortal Sovereign's words spread, the cultivators of the formation hall remained silent, without taking any action.</p><p></p><p>Hongxi himself seemed to lack the courage to repeat the order and watched the protective light shield which was about to collapse, without issuing another command.</p><p></p><p>"I'll help you out."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed, his clone flew into the air, and he shouted, "What are you hesitating for? At this critical moment, all you need to do is follow orders! Whatever consequences arise, Hongxi and I will bear them together!"</p><p></p><p>Hongxi looked at Li Fan in surprise.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators in the formation hall looked at each other, gritted their teeth, and ultimately made a firm decision by force.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the spells flew to various nodes of the Heavenly Rebirth Formation, and the light on the protective shield suddenly intensified.</p><p></p><p>As if time froze suddenly, in the next moment, it seemed that endless spiritual energy was rushing from all directions. The purple light shield then became solid as it easily blocked the impact of the black flow fires.</p><p></p><p>There were no more violent tremors, just continuous dull sounds.</p><p></p><p>The crisis was temporarily averted, but the surviving cultivators in Congyun City did not show much excitement. Along with the tremendous strengthening of the Heavenly Rebirth Formation, there were continuous cries and curses coming from the light screen. Faintly visible were the horrific scenes where humans were instantly drained of all their spiritual energy and turned into skeletons.</p><p></p><p>It was like a purgatory on earth, chilling and terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Although it can protect safety temporarily, it is not a long-term solution. All contact with the headquarters has been cut off, and staying here is just waiting for death."</p><p></p><p>"I want to go out and meet this soul of heaven and earth. I'll leave it to you here!" Hongxi Immortal Sovereign ignored the terrifying scenes all around and transmitted his voice to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After looking into the distance at the point where the black meteorites fell, he took a step forward.</p><p></p><p>His figure flickered, and in an instant, he disappeared from everyone's sight.</p><p></p><p>Hongxi's departure made the originally calm cultivators once again uneasy. Fortunately, the Master Envoy was still there, so they could still maintain some peace of mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, on the other hand, had a stern look on his face as he carefully watched the center of Congyun Sea, waiting patiently.</p><p></p><p>As time passed slowly, when the first wave of black flow fires was all repelled, the crisis of destruction seemed to have passed. The waves in Congyun Sea gradually calmed down, with only the black gelatinous substance clinging to the protective light shield, reminding them of the disaster that had once existed.</p><p></p><p>This abnormal calmness hinted at an ominous impending storm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also sensed something amiss.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Black Flame?" Sensing the swift return of Hongxi Immortal Sovereign, Li Fan's eyes swept across the sky and then towards the deep sea.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like a terrifying disaster was brewing at the bottom of the sea.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a bubble emerged on the surface of the sea. Subsequently, a body akin to a cooked fish, belly up, floated up.</p><p></p><p>Then, in an instant, the entire Congyun Sea seemed to boil.</p><p></p><p>Countless bubbles kept surfacing, accompanied by the countless corpses of marine creatures.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

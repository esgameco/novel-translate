        <h1>Chapter 1041</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>With the mysterious figures leading the way, the two soul fragments no longer encountered any incidents of being torn apart. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, their speed on the mountain path increased several times, with the surrounding scenery rapidly passing by.</p><p></p><p>The only thing that puzzled Li Fan was that the place where he first appeared was clearly at the foot of the Duguo Sect's mountain.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't climbed up much, but the way down the mountain was just as long as the way up.</p><p></p><p>As if there was no end.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time had passed,</p><p></p><p>The two soul fragments' vision blurred, and the hazy figures enveloping them disappeared.</p><p></p><p>As it became quiet around them, they looked to the left and right.</p><p></p><p>The scenery around them was exactly the same: a small courtyard with white walls and a half-closed red wooden door. The walls were mottled with green and red spots, the red seemingly being blood. As for the green, it was the moss growing from the cracks in the walls.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's main body, seeing the identical scene in his mind, had a somewhat inexplicable expression.</p><p></p><p>"Two Duguo Sects? What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Without thinking for too long, he controlled the two soul fragments to push open the red wooden doors and enter the small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The red doors didn't make any creaking sounds due to being old and unmaintained, instead opening silently, bringing a sense of unreality.</p><p></p><p>The instant they entered the courtyard, Li Fan only felt a pair of hands suddenly grab his ankles.</p><p></p><p>This happened in both locations.</p><p></p><p>However, when he looked down, he didn't see anything. But the eerie feeling originating from the depths of his soul couldn't be faked.</p><p></p><p>"This time I must give Tian Xuan Jing a good beating. He never mentioned how bizarre this Duguo Sect is."</p><p></p><p>This thought flashed through his mind, and the two soul fragments ignored the strange sensation coming from below, continuing to explore deeper into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The doors of the central hall were tightly locked and couldn't be opened.</p><p></p><p>There was only one stone door on the left and right each, leading to unknown places.</p><p></p><p>The scenes where the two soul fragments were located were exactly like this.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting." Li Fan's eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>He first tried attacking the central hall, but even after the hall was destroyed, it was restored in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then had the two soul fragments each enter a stone door, one on the left and one on the right.</p><p></p><p>The scene before his eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan's vision cleared, he couldn't help but be a bit stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because beyond the stone doors was surprisingly the exact same scene as the previous courtyard!</p><p></p><p>There were still stone doors on the left and right, with the central hall's doors tightly locked!</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>The way back had disappeared, leaving only the option to continue exploring forward.</p><p></p><p>The four soul fragments each walked into different stone doors.</p><p></p><p>The scene changed again.</p><p></p><p>As expected, what met his eyes was still the same scene as before.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan furrowed his brows and continued dividing his soul.</p><p></p><p>Eight soul fragments slowly floated into the stone doors.</p><p></p><p>Sixteen, thirty-two, sixty-four, one hundred twenty-eight...</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was only a single soul fragment of Li Fan's that entered the Duguo Sect to explore. After splitting into 1,024 individuals, he finally had no strength to continue dividing.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the left and right doors beside the soul fragments, Li Fan knew that the initial exploration had failed.</p><p></p><p>"Did I go in the wrong direction and enter a trap? Or..."</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Duguo Sect's test?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, then cut off nearly a third of his own soul.</p><p></p><p>Even with the Wuji Yingxu technique to replenish it, Li Fan felt a wave of dizziness.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The difference between this one-third of the soul and the previous simple soul division is that it is wrapped with a large amount of extracted power from the five elements.</p><p></p><p>It is enough to support this soul to complete multiple divisions.</p><p></p><p>"Go." Watching the soul disappear into the void, Li Fan quickly recovered from his injuries while continuing to view the images transmitted by the soul.</p><p></p><p>Just like the previous encounter, the soul soon entered the Duguo Sect.</p><p></p><p>Once again, it was torn apart by the mysterious figure and entered different courtyards above and below.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Li Fan a little was that he didn't find the souls that had entered before.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that they entered different spaces respectively.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart moved, and he let the original 1,024 souls self-destruct simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>As the sensory images disappeared, the souls deep within the Duguo Sect did not feel any change.</p><p></p><p>"Isolated perception."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed worthy of being one of the top ten immortal sects of ancient times."</p><p></p><p>Having not yet reached the realm where he could ignore the arrangements here, Li Fan could only explore according to their game rules.</p><p></p><p>Each time he entered a courtyard, he divided into two individuals and explored separately.</p><p></p><p>This continued for a total of 72 times.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Duguo Sect, the Hua Dao Stone in Li Fan's sea of consciousness emitted an unprecedented brilliant glow.</p><p></p><p>Countless identical scenes were listed in the Hua Dao Stone.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, these extremely similar scenes reduced the processing burden. Otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew that this was already his limit.</p><p></p><p>If he split one more time, the soul could still support it.</p><p></p><p>But he himself would be forced to cut off all those sensory images. Otherwise, there was a risk of his sea of consciousness being blown up.</p><p></p><p>The souls now were only left with an extremely weak trace.</p><p></p><p>The void was almost invisible.</p><p></p><p>Without the attachment of power, even a mortal strike might be able to disperse them.</p><p></p><p>But they still floated slowly towards their respective entrances according to Li Fan's instructions.</p><p></p><p>More images surged together again.</p><p></p><p>It caused Li Fan's thoughts to fall into a brief stillness.</p><p></p><p>Then...</p><p></p><p>Like countless souls all projected downwards, they finally converged to a point.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of dizziness, they merged back together.</p><p></p><p>It took some time to adapt to the single image.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes and observed the surrounding environment.</p><p></p><p>It was still the courtyard he had seen countless times.</p><p></p><p>But there were no more stone doors on the left and right of the wall.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the central hall, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>He walked up slowly and gently pushed open the door.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, a black dot seemed to appear, absorbing all the surrounding light.</p><p></p><p>Scene after scene played out rapidly in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Catastrophe is coming, it is a great calamity, but also an opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"If we can successfully pass this catastrophe, we shall exist forever..."</p><p></p><p>"In endless possibilities, there indeed exists that one thread of chance."</p><p></p><p>"Only by seeking life in death."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, if the Xuanhuang can survive the great catastrophe, we can also use the power of the catastrophe to achieve transcendence."</p><p></p><p>"Then, let's start."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, there seemed to be many identical figures conversing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>And as the images progressed, Li Fan discovered with some shock that these figures had all turned into the appearance he had seen before.</p><p></p><p>The dense paper men filling the world!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mind was shaken, and he wanted to look further.</p><p></p><p>But he felt the surrounding dark space shaking violently.</p><p></p><p>All the illusory scenes disappeared.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 898</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"It's truly pitiful..."</p><p></p><p>From the memories of the young preacher, the Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect learned about the various events that occurred in the Xuanhuang Realm during his slumber. It made him feel as if he was reading a third-rate absurd story.</p><p></p><p>"Even when a great calamity is about to befall, they still continue to fight endlessly..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps this is human nature. The judgment of the Xuantian King back then was not wrong."</p><p></p><p>The Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he had no intention of setting things right.</p><p></p><p>What he wanted to do now was to find the Xuantian King and escape from this place before the Xuanhuang Realm completely fell into the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>If the Xuantian King was still nowhere to be found...</p><p></p><p>Then he could only find a way on his own.</p><p></p><p>In the mind of the young preacher, there were quite a few plans for escape.</p><p></p><p>But in the eyes of the Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect, the feasibility of these plans was not very high.</p><p></p><p>What is the "Darkest Starry Sky"?</p><p></p><p>Why did the Xuantian King firmly believe that only those who had reached the true immortal realm could escape from this dead domain?</p><p></p><p>The various escape plans deduced by the Myriad Immortal Alliance could indeed enable some people to leave the Xuanhuang Realm and temporarily escape the attraction of the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>But the influence of the Immortal Ruins was an unimaginably vast void.</p><p></p><p>In the void, the many immortal realms that were originally full of life, like stars, had all been devoured by the Immortal Ruins in recent years.</p><p></p><p>The bright starry sky had also become dark and silent because of it.</p><p></p><p>Many people could escape from the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>But to escape from this dark prison...</p><p></p><p>It was not only because this dark void was too vast. Even if a powerful being at the Longevity Realm ventured into it without any reference or guidance from a Dao marker, they would only end up lost and trapped to death.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, outside the Darkest Starry Sky, a "high wall" was artificially created.</p><p></p><p>At the edge of the Darkest Starry Sky, it made all living beings who wanted to break through sigh in despair.</p><p></p><p>The Xuantian King speculated that this "high wall" might have been built by cultivators outside the Darkest Starry Sky to prevent the disaster of the Immortal Ruins from continuing to spread outward.</p><p></p><p>To cross the high wall, one must burst out with superhuman power in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the so-called escape was just moving from one place to another within the prison.</p><p></p><p>"If the Floating Star Array Formation is still intact, with the current scale of the Xuanhuang Realm, if the power of the array formation is fully activated, perhaps the burst at the very peak would be enough to cross the high wall."</p><p></p><p>The young man pondered, looking at the ruins of the Purple Dawn Sect around him.</p><p></p><p>Then with a wave, he removed the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths Array Formation covering this place.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, his figure flickered and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The ruins of the Purple Dawn Sect once again fell into the long-standing tranquility.</p><p></p><p>The air distorted, and a figure suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect, who had originally left and returned, had actually come back to this place again.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, he had never left.</p><p></p><p>The previous "departure" was just a trick to deceive the eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I still wanted to see this brother of the sect, but it's a pity."</p><p></p><p>Since it was not meant to be, the Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect did not insist.</p><p></p><p>With a flash, his figure completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>This time, it was not a feint, but he really left.</p><p></p><p>After more than ten days, a furtive figure came to the outskirts of the Purple Dawn Sect ruins.</p><p></p><p>The appearance could not be seen clearly, and the aura was hidden.</p><p></p><p>It was Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After observing from a distance for a while and making sure there was no danger...</p><p></p><p>And there was no warning in his own heart.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he vigilantly step forward.</p><p></p><p>During this time, after diverting the trouble of the Wanxian Alliance's Dharma transmitters, he had been patiently waiting around.</p><p></p><p>Sensing that the aura here had completely disappeared, he waited for a long time before returning.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he thought that when two strong forces fought, there must be injuries.</p><p></p><p>But somewhat to his surprise, the Wanxian Alliance had no reaction to this matter at all.</p><p></p><p>Even those people from the exposed Congyun Sea Mutual Aid Association were not pursued by the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>It was as if nothing had ever happened.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan wanted to know what exactly happened here.</p><p></p><p>A flash of silver light appeared in his eyes, and a hidden formation in the air was activated.</p><p></p><p>This was a formation that Li Fan derived from the Endgame Dissociation Disc, which was one level higher than this era and difficult for other cultivators to detect.</p><p></p><p>It had only one function, which was to record all the scenes within the coverage of the formation.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan kept casting spells, the scenes that happened more than ten days ago reappeared in the air.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the bizarre divine ability of the Xuantian Sect's Dharma King, a trace of horror flashed through Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>Especially after he devoured the young Dharma transmitter, who seemed to be at the peak of the Hedao realm, with almost no effort, Li Fan was even more shocked.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he suppressed the shock in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the strength of the Xuantian Sect's Dharma King?"</p><p></p><p>"It's truly strange and unpredictable, making it difficult to guard against."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan put himself in the young Dharma transmitter's shoes and exchanged positions with him. However, he couldn't think of a suitable countermeasure for a while.</p><p></p><p>Although he had the immense power of the Five Elements Grotto-Heaven and the protection of the Seven-Colored Divine Light,</p><p></p><p>when facing the bizarre offensive means of the Xuantian Sect, he couldn't exert any particularly great advantage.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but recall the several Xuantian Sect's divine techniques he had seen in Senior Sister Zhao's illusion.</p><p></p><p>"The Ode of Heaven and Earth's Mutual Conquest", "The Eternal Solitude Secret", "The Soul-Severing Divine Light Technique", "The Scripture of Heaven's Sorrow and Earth's Grief".</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Zhao could become a One-Heart Celestial Venerable with just one "Eternal Solitude Secret".</p><p></p><p>This was enough to show how powerful the foundation of the Xuantian Sect was.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I was cautious enough and didn't provoke this person just because I had great strength. Otherwise, I'm afraid I would have been forced to show my true face again." Li Fan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Next, Li Fan saw that after devouring the young Dharma transmitter, this Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect looked dazed.</p><p></p><p>He would sometimes look up at the sky and sometimes mutter to himself.</p><p></p><p>When he heard the other party mistakenly regard himself as a member of the Xuantian Sect, Li Fan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, this Dharma King seemed to fall into reminiscence.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could only vaguely distinguish the words "Xuantian King" and "escape" that he occasionally uttered.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't know what the other party was really thinking in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to play the footage.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the other party playing a trick, trying to ambush him, Li Fan couldn't help but sneer coldly.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't a hundred percent safe, how could he show up?</p><p></p><p>After patiently watching the rest of the recorded footage at an accelerated speed, Li Fan erased the formation.</p><p></p><p>Then he hurriedly returned to the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>He came to the circular grand hall where the faceless statue of Xuantian God was placed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared at this stone statue intently.</p><p></p><p>"Originally, I was thinking of using this as bait to lure the remnants of the Xuantian Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Then I would close the door and beat the dog, capturing them alive. From their minds, I would obtain some ancient secrets of the Xuantian Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Now it seems that I overestimated myself."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1112</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1110: The Celestial Venerable of Life and Death Appears</p><p></p><p>These corpses were all frozen in pale blue transparent ice crystals.</p><p></p><p>Through the ice crystals, one could vaguely see the final expressions on these corpses' faces before they died.</p><p></p><p>Anger, fear, confusion...</p><p></p><p>Lifelike, as if they were still alive.</p><p></p><p>The densely packed ice crystal coffins filled the entire field of vision, covering the entire black sea.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention those few Dao-Merging cultivators, even the three Dharma-Transmitting leaders felt their hair stand on end and were shocked speechless upon witnessing the scene before them.</p><p></p><p>Stunned by this scene, by the time they came back to their senses, the True Immortal's remains that had lured them here had long disappeared without a trace!</p><p></p><p>"What... what the hell is this place?!"</p><p></p><p>After a deathly silence, one of the Dao-Merging cultivators named Zhu Gongchuan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Gongchuan's voice was very soft, for fear of disturbing the cultivators resting here. And one could vaguely hear the fear in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It's not that they had never seen dead people before.</p><p></p><p>But to have so many corpses all gathered in one place, and still preserving their vivid expressions from when they were alive...</p><p></p><p>The shock brought by this scene was far beyond what words could describe.</p><p></p><p>No one answered Zhu Gongchuan's question.</p><p></p><p>The group flew silently over the dead sea for a full half day, still not finding an end.</p><p></p><p>"By initial estimates, there are over 2 billion corpses here... I'm afraid even if you add up all the cultivators and mortals currently living in the Biao State Domain of the Myriad Immortal Alliance, there wouldn't be this many. Just what..."</p><p></p><p>"These people are not from the Xuanhuang World. Or rather, the vast majority are not from the Xuanhuang World." Dharma-Transmitter Wei said slowly at this time. </p><p></p><p>"Judging from the style of their clothing, these people should all be from different immortal cultivation worlds. But for some reason, they were all frozen here."</p><p></p><p>"So many corpses, hidden within our Myriad Immortal Alliance's territory. Yet for such a long time, we were completely unaware of this." The other Dharma-Transmitter Zhu's face also turned extremely ugly.</p><p></p><p>"What was the purpose of that True Immortal's remains in luring us here? Could it be that it also wants to turn us into this state?"</p><p></p><p>"No. We've been in here for so long, yet we haven't been attacked at all."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The group discussed in low voices, but had no clue about the True Immortal's remains' ultimate goal.</p><p></p><p>"Let's keep searching."</p><p></p><p>So they flew over the dead sea for a long time again.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Dharma-Transmitter Wei discovered a clue: "These countless frozen corpses seem to form a huge formation."</p><p></p><p>"A formation?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone looked at each other, then carefully looked around again.</p><p></p><p>"A formation of such a large scale, I'm afraid it has the power to destroy heaven and earth. Could it be that this is the Five Elders' secret arrangement over these years to destroy our Myriad Immortal Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>"This formation is extremely complex. We've only seen a corner and not the full picture, so we can't deduce its true purpose. The most urgent task is to first notify the Immortal Alliance headquarters of our discovery here. Staying here for too long, I always feel a bit uncomfortable." Dharma-Transmitter Zhu said gravely.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, this formation doesn't seem to be targeting us outsiders. It's neither a trapping formation nor a killing formation. As long as we find the eye of the formation, we should be able to get out." Dharma-Transmitter Wei also made a judgment.</p><p></p><p>With the two Dharma-Transmitters reaching conclusions, the group secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>After wandering in the formation for several days, they finally...</p><p></p><p>The travelers finally found the center of the formation. Passing through it, they thought they would leave this bizarre area, but unexpectedly, they didn't return to the white fog.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they appeared above another unfamiliar ocean.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the deathly still, frozen black sea before, the salty and humid sea breeze here was slightly intoxicating, and the cries of birds constantly reached their ears.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, schools of fish could be seen leaping out of the water or swimming swiftly in the sea.</p><p></p><p>It was full of vitality, making people feel refreshed and happy.</p><p></p><p>After a brief moment of surprise, the group quickly scanned their surroundings and found no danger.</p><p></p><p>The Dao cultivators felt slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>However, the three leading Dharma Masters had an unprecedented solemn expression on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Dharma Master Wei frowned, gazing at the sky, and muttered to himself, "Different worlds, two sides of the same body."</p><p></p><p>"One is for life, the other for death."</p><p></p><p>Dharma Master Chu interrupted his words, "No, death is the source of life, and life is the gathering of death. This is..."</p><p></p><p>The two looked at each other, a look of horror on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Reversing life and death?"</p><p></p><p>The two were very tacit and did not say these four words out loud.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they used voice transmission to communicate.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is. In that case, this place is the Dao arena of that Ascended Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder He reversed the principles of heaven and earth and attained the Dao so quickly. It turns out He had long been hidden in this white fog, using formations as a foundation to thoroughly study the principles of life and death!"</p><p></p><p>"Then what does the remains of the True Immortal have to do with the Ascended Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>Having solved one mystery, new doubts immediately arose in their minds.</p><p></p><p>"From the current situation, they shouldn't be in cahoots."</p><p></p><p>"He discovered the location of this Dao arena long ago, so he deliberately led us here to probe the Ascended Venerable's background?"</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, there was no definite conclusion.</p><p></p><p>"Once we find the formation's center in the world of life, we should be able to leave from here." Unable to find any information related to the Ascended Venerable's true identity after searching the entire Dao arena, the three Dharma Masters decided to return first and plan for the long term.</p><p></p><p>However, just as they were about to leave, Dharma Master Wei's body slightly paused, as if he had thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"Reversing life and death, reversing life and death..."</p><p></p><p>"The great formation is complete, but those dead cultivators haven't been revived. What has truly been revived is the [world]?"</p><p></p><p>"In that case, the Ascended Venerable's true purpose is..."</p><p></p><p>Dharma Master Wei was struck as if by lightning, his face turning deathly pale in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Go!" He decisively shouted.</p><p></p><p>However, as if sensing his thoughts, a figure seemingly made of white fog quietly appeared, blocking the group's path.</p><p></p><p>Faced with this sudden enemy, who very likely was the elusive Ascended Venerable, everyone instantly became extremely tense.</p><p></p><p>A battle was imminent.</p><p></p><p>Dharma Master Wei stared at the figure before him for a moment. After a while, a look of disbelief flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, the white fog figure suddenly opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>Endless white fog surged out from its body, engulfing everything like a vast blanket.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it swallowed the entire Wanxian Alliance group.</p><p></p><p>Ten Dao cultivators and three Dharma Masters.</p><p></p><p>Such a huge force, at this moment, had no power to resist at all and disappeared into the white fog in the blink of an eye.</p>

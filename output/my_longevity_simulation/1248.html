        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang hid himself and observed the battle between the Five Elders Sect cultivators and the Great Ape Monkey. Slowly, he couldn't help but feel a sense of gravity in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"So strong..."</p><p></p><p>This was his evaluation of the cultivators before him.</p><p></p><p>Without spiritual energy fluctuations, and with the destructive range of both sides' techniques limited to a certain space, Sun Erlang could not sense their specific cultivation levels.</p><p></p><p>But just from the coordination between the cultivators in battle, as well as their fearlessness and calmness in facing various crises and other combat qualities, the level of this team of cultivators was truly the best he had ever seen in his life.</p><p></p><p>Even counting those he encountered in the simulated world of the Dao Stone, this team of cultivators was still an extremely top-notch existence.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Sun Erlang even more was their attack and healing methods.</p><p></p><p>In addition to various magical tools, these cultivators would occasionally use some rather peculiar items. Such as books, wine cups, and even necklaces. While providing buffs to their own side, they also inflicted various negative effects on the Great Ape Monkey.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, their healing speed was also frighteningly fast.</p><p></p><p>New Law cultivators who housed their bodies in grotto-heavens, after their bodies were destroyed and reborn from the grotto-heaven, needed at least a few breaths of time.</p><p></p><p>But this group of people only had a flash of white light, and even the heaviest injuries could be instantly restored. In the previous moment, they were hit by the Great Ape Monkey's attack and their lives were in danger. The next second, under the illumination of the white light, they became lively and energetic again.</p><p></p><p>Even if that Great Ape Monkey had thick skin and strong flesh, it couldn't withstand such consumption.</p><p></p><p>And strangely, this demonic beast was stubborn and didn't know how to escape.</p><p></p><p>It fought until the last moment of its life, and then collapsed with a bang.</p><p></p><p>The moment the Great Ape Monkey died, it turned into a dazzling golden light and surged into the bodies of the team of cultivators who killed it.</p><p></p><p>Those people immediately let out a cheer.</p><p></p><p>"The boss that spawned this time was really damn thick-blooded. Fortunately, we prepared enough supplies, otherwise we would have definitely lost."</p><p></p><p>"It also gave a lot of experience. I'm about to break through to the next realm."</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that its [Snow Ape Sacred Armor] in the encyclopedia didn't drop, otherwise we would have really struck it rich this time."</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out, it caused the crowd of team members to agree and sigh one after another.</p><p></p><p>However, Sun Erlang listened to this completely meaningless speech with a somewhat subtle expression.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, there's nothing good around here. Let's go back to [Paradise] first and talk about it."</p><p></p><p>"This [Xuanhuang Realm] is indeed not a place for people to stay. If it weren't for the mission requirements, I really wouldn't want to come here."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the small team flew into the airship in the sky one after another, discussing.</p><p></p><p>The airship was enveloped in a colorful light, and disappeared on the sky as if it had teleported.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang stared at the position where they left, and the Dao Stone in his mind kept replaying the recorded images just now.</p><p></p><p>"Paradise..."</p><p></p><p>"It should be the sphere of influence of that Carefree Celestial Venerable. It seems to be somewhat different from other places in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"They actually called the Xuanhuang Realm 'a place not for people to stay'... Interesting."</p><p></p><p>"This matter should perhaps be reported to Master."</p><p></p><p>Keeping in mind the mission entrusted by his master, he continued to advance towards the True Realm.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, when passing through a white fog barrier, Sun Erlang clearly felt that something in the world had changed.</p><p></p><p>"The state I was in just now belongs to the [Human Dao Celestial Realm]. As for here, it should be the [True Realm]."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang knew that within the True Realm, under the coverage of the Celestial Venerable's principles and laws, all cultivators could not fabricate lies.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he became even more cautious.</p><p></p><p>Being a newcomer, he was very unfamiliar with everything here. Sun Erlang decided to inquire about the situation first, and then find a way to meet the Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Human Dao Celestial Realm, the True Realm appeared more peaceful. It was rare to see patrolling Five Elders Sect cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The boundaries between mortals and cultivators within the realm were also not particularly obvious.</p><p></p><p>It could be seen from afar that they lived in the same city.</p><p></p><p>"Those are indeed all mortals, without cultivation. It seems that the power of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma is suppressed here."</p><p></p><p>After careful observation, Sun Erlang came to a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>What made him feel even more novel was that the actual seniority here was not determined by the level of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He could even see a young Golden Core cultivator respectfully bowing to an elderly mortal.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't help but make him click his tongue in amazement.</p><p></p><p>After secretly observing for three days, although he had a general understanding of the customs and people of the True Realm, he still hadn't found any suitable breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"I can't just shout on the street that I'm here to seek an audience with the True Celestial Venerable, right?"</p><p></p><p>Just when Sun Erlang was at his wit's end, this day, he suddenly discovered a few outsiders like himself.</p><p></p><p>"People from the Myriad Immortals Alliance?" Sun Erlang narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>After eavesdropping for a while, Sun Erlang immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>These four cultivators were captured in the conflict between the Five Elders Sect and the Myriad Immortals Alliance, and were now naturalized members in their probationary period.</p><p></p><p>Their freedom was not restricted, and they were allowed to travel in the three major realms of the Five Elders Sect except for the Carefree Paradise.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, what do you think of the Five Elders Sect compared to the Immortal Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>The few people were all wearing the same eye-catching green clothes like prison uniforms. One of them, a middle-aged man with a long beard, asked his companion beside him.</p><p></p><p>That cultivator surnamed Xu seemed to have not recovered from serious injuries, his face pale. He coughed lightly, and then replied, "Compared to the Immortal Alliance, it is indeed much more free and leisurely."</p><p></p><p>Another young cultivator echoed, "Moreover, once you sign a contract here, there is no shortage of cultivation technique resources. As long as you show enough talent, there is endless room for development, and no one will hinder or suppress you. Unlike that Myriad Immortals Alliance, humph..."</p><p></p><p>Although the long-bearded man's expression was somewhat unsightly, he had to agree with the views of the others.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Brother Wang Yang still has illusions about the Myriad Immortals Alliance!" That cultivator surnamed Xu saw Wang Yang's expression and couldn't help but sneer.</p><p></p><p>"Do you remember the Myriad Immortals Alliance, does the Myriad Immortals Alliance remember you? I have never heard of a cultivator who was captured by the Five Elders Sect and successfully escaped back to the Immortal Alliance. Moreover, even if you are lucky enough to escape, the Myriad Immortals Alliance will probably treat you as a spy and directly arrest you."</p><p></p><p>Wang Yang's expression was uncertain, but in the end he could only sigh and couldn't refute.</p><p></p><p>The four fell into an awkward silence for a while.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, that senior who introduced the situation of the Five Elders Sect before said that the cultivators of every state here have the opportunity to directly meet the Celestial Venerable. I don't know if it's true or false." It was still that young cultivator who stood out to smooth things over.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry about this, Brother Zhang. I have inquired about it before, and it is absolutely true. However, the methods of meeting the Celestial Venerable in various places are also different, and without exception, they are all extremely difficult. Only the most extraordinary geniuses can..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's possible," said the man surnamed Xu.</p><p></p><p>"For example, in the One Heart Immortal Sect, if someone wins twenty consecutive battles within their territory and remains unmatched, they have a high probability of being brought before the One Heart Celestial Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Another example is here in the Realm of Truth. It's said that as long as one sits and comprehends the Dao under the Tree of Truth, the longer they persist, the greater the chance of receiving guidance from the Celestial Lord." The man surnamed Xu explained incessantly.</p><p></p><p>"I have also attempted the trial of the Tree of Truth..." The man surnamed Xu said, deliberately pausing.</p><p></p><p>Once the gazes of the others were all gathered on him, he continued, "Difficult! Difficult! Difficult!"</p><p></p><p>"You all know that lies do not exist within the Realm of Truth. And the trial of the Tree of Truth is to weave lies as much as possible!"</p><p></p><p>The Xu cultivator's expression became a bit strange: "Sitting under the fruit, it's as if one becomes an omnipotent god of creation. One needs to create something out of nothing, fabricating an illusory, alternate world. The richer and more realistic the details of the world, the longer one can endure under the Tree's cleansing."</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment..." Upon hearing this, Wang Yang couldn't help but interrupt the Xu cultivator's words.</p><p></p><p>"Are there any restrictions on weaving this world? Otherwise, wouldn't it be very easy to substitute it with the unique small world styles found in the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Xu cultivator shook his head: "At the very least, small worlds that truly exist within the scope of the Xuanhuang Realm cannot be manifested in the fruit's illusion. It's like..."</p><p></p><p>He pondered for a moment before slowly saying, "It's a bit like 'Techniques Cannot Be Cultivated Together'. Imitating a world based on an existing model will vanish into thin air the moment it takes shape. Only completely fictitious worlds can stably exist and withstand the fruit's trial. It does sound a bit profound when described in words. However, you'll understand once you personally experience it."</p><p></p><p>"Even if one ultimately cannot meet the True Celestial Lord, sitting in meditation on that Tree of Truth is still a tremendous opportunity for cultivators like us. Weaving a world involves myriad aspects of the Great Dao. It's truly difficult to achieve relying solely on a cultivator's own strength. When undergoing the trial, it's more about borrowing the power of the Tree. It's as if the Celestial Lord lends us a brush, assisting us in splashing ink and painting..." The Xu cultivator's expression became dreamy, as if savoring that magical experience.</p><p></p><p>"What is the purpose of the Celestial Lord doing this?" Wang Yang frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Xu cultivator chuckled: "Purpose? Why bother considering that? I only know that completing the trial not only results in no losses but also has a high chance of comprehending the Dao and achieving a breakthrough. This kind of good fortune is something only a select few can enjoy in the Myriad Immortal Alliance. Yet in this Five Elders Assembly, everyone has the opportunity to attempt it."</p><p></p><p>"That Tree of Truth takes root and sprouts in the illusory, blooming in every city. Anyone interested can sit cross-legged and meditate under the tree."</p><p></p><p>"The manifestation of the fruit this time also seems to be not far off. You can all personally experience it. If it weren't for the fact that one only has a single chance in their lifetime, I would definitely want to taste the opportunity of creating a world again." The Xu cultivator said with some regret.</p><p></p><p>The other three had varied expressions.</p><p></p><p>"How coincidental? Just as I was dozing off, someone comes to deliver a pillow? Could it be that I've been discovered, and this is some kind of plot?"</p><p></p><p>This thought immediately flashed through Sun Erlang's mind.</p><p></p><p>"No, Master should have known in advance that each region of the Five Elders Assembly has methods to directly meet the various Celestial Lords. That's why he sent me on this trip. Otherwise, under normal circumstances, what kind of opportunity would an outside cultivator have to meet the supreme ruler at the Eternal Realm?" After pondering for a moment, Sun Erlang suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>"The Fruit of Truth?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, he had the Dao-Transforming Stone and the experience of going through another life in a simulated world. Participating in this so-called world creation under the Tree should give him some advantage.</p><p></p><p>"I'll try it first and see. If it really doesn't work, I'll think of other methods."</p><p></p><p>With a plan in mind, Sun Erlang patiently waited.</p><p></p><p>Another twenty-some days passed. On this day, the tranquil city suddenly became a bit chaotic.</p><p></p><p>On the ground, a shadow rapidly spread from the center of the city.</p><p></p><p>Enveloping the entire city.</p><p></p><p>Then, a lush and verdant giant tree rose from the shadow.</p><p></p><p>Seeming both real and illusory.</p><p></p><p>On the tree branches hung quite a few tender and glistening fruits that captivated one's gaze with just a single glance.</p><p></p><p>"The Tree of Truth manifests in the world, existing for seven days and seven nights. All living beings within the realm can comprehend the Dao under the tree."</p><p></p><p>Ding!</p><p></p><p>The crisp sound of a bell resonated, spreading towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>A clear voice came from the sky, appearing in everyone's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Thank the Celestial Lord for his grace!"</p><p></p><p>Within the Realm of Truth, countless living beings kowtowed in unison.</p><p></p><p>Three times in a row, the echoes lingered.</p><p></p><p>After the ceremonial formalities concluded, cultivators began walking to the shadow beneath the Tree of Truth one after another, sitting cross-legged with their eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>The city also instantly became very quiet, afraid of disturbing these cultivators undergoing the trial.</p><p></p><p>The group of Myriad Immortal Alliance assimilators that Sun Erlang had encountered earlier also slowly walked towards the Tree of Truth.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, they didn't encounter any inspectors.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Lord's words about all living beings being allowed to attempt were indeed not false.</p><p></p><p>Arriving under the canopy of the Tree, Sun Erlang even saw not only humans but also some flying insects and walking beasts occupying a spot under the tree's shade.</p><p></p><p>This peculiar scene made Sun Erlang feel a bit emotional.</p><p></p><p>"It's said that the sages of ancient times taught without discrimination. Not only humans but all living beings in the world could receive their teachings. This True Celestial Lord does seem to have that flavor."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang also followed the others' example and sat on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Sun Erlang only felt the surrounding world disappear.</p><p></p><p>The faint rustling sounds originally present in the city all vanished.</p><p></p><p>Although his eyes were closed, Sun Erlang felt as if he had opened them.</p><p></p><p>Before him was a vast expanse of white nothingness.</p><p></p><p>"Create a world..."</p><p></p><p>Numerous rule-related information surfaced in Sun Erlang's mind one after another.</p><p></p><p>"First is the general state of the world."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang then set it according to the simulated world he had experienced in the Dao-Transforming Stone.</p><p></p><p>The blank world gained color.</p><p></p><p>However, to his surprise, just as the world was about to take shape, it collapsed like a sand sculpture.</p><p></p><p>Returning to blankness once again.</p><p></p><p>"Even a modified world based on the Xuanhuang Realm won't work?"</p><p></p><p>"A completely fictitious world?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang couldn't help but frown slightly.</p><p></p><p>But then, he had a flash of inspiration, recalling a world his Master had used as an example when teaching him.</p><p></p><p>His heart immediately had an idea.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Dao is not manifest, only matter endures."</p>

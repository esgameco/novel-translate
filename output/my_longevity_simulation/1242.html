        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Murderous intent surged in Li Ping's mind, but very quickly, the aura emanating from his body disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>As the Holy Emperor of the Great Enlightenment, he must not show his emotions on his face.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were no outsiders present at the moment, it had to be this way.</p><p></p><p>"Withdrawing the power of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao does not necessarily mean they have to be executed."</p><p></p><p>"If they are willing to return the power, I do not wish to create more killing. But if..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's heart turned cold.</p><p></p><p>Although Ruomu and Shiban were both alone in the world, their combat strength was definitely equivalent to that of an Immortal at the Changsheng Realm. Fighting them would be a good choice as a warm-up before the decisive battle with the Myriad Immortal Alliance. </p><p></p><p>"When a lion hunts a rabbit, it must use its full strength. I cannot underestimate them either."</p><p></p><p>"If Ruomu is weaker, I will start with him first. I must also avoid Shiban's eyes..."</p><p></p><p>A plan gradually took shape in the Holy Emperor's mind.</p><p></p><p>As one of the three main branches of Ruomu's fall to the mortal world, the Ancient Tree of Earth Veins must have a specific connection with the main body.</p><p></p><p>Since being heavily injured by cultivators, Ruomu had gone mad and did not appear in the world.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the true hiding place of Ruomu could be located first through the Ancient Tree of Earth Veins. And then weaken his power.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, before long, Wang Xuanba arrived at the Holy Emperor's seat.</p><p></p><p>The evil thoughts of Xuanhuang were completely devoured by Li Ping, so naturally there was no need for him to stay on the mountain peak of the sealed small world all the time.</p><p></p><p>After receiving the Holy Emperor's telepathic message not long ago, he had already returned to the Holy Capital.</p><p></p><p>And the heavenly blessing that descended during Li Ping's breakthrough, because of the presence of an avatar body in the small world, was also enjoyed a little.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wang Xuanba's cultivation had almost reached the peak of the Nascent Soul stage, and he was not far from Deity Transformation.</p><p></p><p>However, Wang Xuanba's strength was more reflected in the abilities of various demonic beasts. The cultivation stage was actually not that important to him.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao-One Insect has a mutant strain that can erode spiritual wood. Cultivate some first, I will have a great use for them soon."</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba nodded and accepted the order.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Just as the Holy Emperor Li Ping was preparing to reveal his lofty ambitions to the Xuanhuang Realm for the first time.</p><p></p><p>In the distant Dark Star Sea on the other side of the Xuanxian Boat, the Holy Fetus Li Fan encountered a crisis.</p><p></p><p>The source of the danger did not come from the remnant power of true immortals in the starry sky, nor from unknown cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But the sea of relics he was in.</p><p></p><p>Just not long ago, for some unknown reason, this originally very stable ruins suddenly began to tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>The tremor of the sea of relics was secondary, more importantly, when this continuous ruins was no longer like a single entity, the suction from the high wall in the deeper starry sea became more and more obvious.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the Holy Fetus Li Fan, the entire starry sky was like a sudden high tide, sweeping countless gathered relics and dragging them to the shore.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanxian Boat activated a special contingency plan.</p><p></p><p>It was not advancing in a fixed direction, but flashing and shifting, constantly changing positions.</p><p></p><p>Like a constantly rotating compass needle, it dissipated the suction from the high wall.</p><p></p><p>At first, the Holy Fetus Li Fan also wanted to learn this method to resist the suction of the high wall.</p><p></p><p>But it was not as easy as it looked.</p><p></p><p>"The rotation of the immortal boat is not only taking itself as the node, but is vaguely connected with the entire sea of relics. Relying on these nearly infinite relics, it barely escapes."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan only felt a force pulling on his body.</p><p></p><p>Even flying in the opposite direction with his sword, he was still sinking little by little.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that he was getting farther and farther away from the Xuanxian Boat and about to be dragged into the depths of the sea of relics, the Holy Fetus Li Fan couldn't help but have the idea of forcing his way into the immortal boat for shelter.</p><p></p><p>Although he would face a bitter battle, it was better than crashing head-on into that invisible high wall.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to take action, in the Dark Star Sea, from the direction of the Xuanhuang Realm and the Immortal Ruins, a seven-colored rainbow light suddenly attracted his attention.</p><p></p><p>At first he was slightly stunned, but he quickly realized that it was the sixteen Dao-Unifying cultivators who came in response to the Myriad Immortal Alliance's summons!</p><p></p><p>"They came so fast?"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan couldn't help but be surprised.</p><p></p><p>Even considering the factor of different time flow speeds in various regions of the starry sea, the arrival of this rainbow light was much earlier than Li Fan had expected.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, could it be that this sudden change in suction is precisely to guide the rainbow light of the Myriad Immortal Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that rainbow light speeding through the starry sea, this thought couldn't help but surface in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, he gave up the futile struggle and flew towards the depths of the starry sea with the help of the suction.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the rainbow light was extremely fast, but it slowed down in the sea of relics full of ruins.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan followed quietly with his sword formation protecting his body.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Fan thought that the scope of this sea of relics should be limited.</p><p></p><p>But after tracking for about three days in the Xuanhuang Realm's time, he still had not flown out of this continuous ruins. Li Fan finally had a general understanding of the scale of the once prosperous cultivation world in the Dark Star Sea.</p><p></p><p>Outside the relics, there was no end in sight, no distinction between east, west, south and north.</p><p></p><p>But the rainbow light of the Myriad Immortal Alliance obviously had a special guide, always maintaining a fixed direction.</p><p></p><p>And the route seemed to be carefully calculated, avoiding all the dangerous areas in the ruins.</p><p></p><p>Another four days passed.</p><p></p><p>The dense broken relics in front suddenly became sparse.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's spirit shook, knowing that he was about to fly out of the range of the sea of relics.</p><p></p><p>Without obstruction, the rainbow light gradually accelerated.</p><p></p><p>In just half a day, an unforgettable scene appeared before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>A long wall stood in the dark void ahead.</p><p></p><p>At first, Li Fan thought this was the so-called high wall.</p><p></p><p>But when he saw the details of the long wall clearly, Li Fan suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>Those "bricks" that made up the endless city wall were clearly one broken world after another!</p><p></p><p>Just like the ruins in this sea of relics, ahead were the ruins of worlds!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan estimated that even if it devoured many remnants of cultivation realms, far exceeding the scale of the Xuanhuang Realm in ancient times, it would only be an insignificant section in this long wall of remnant realms.</p><p></p><p>"Just how many cultivation realms perished in the ancient calamity?"</p><p></p><p>"And by what great power were they all gathered here?"</p><p></p><p>"The high wall..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked into the distance, trying to find the high wall that he had only heard of but never seen.</p><p></p><p>But in the darkness, apart from countless world fragments, no other anomalies could be seen.</p><p></p><p>After a brief daze, Li Fan found that he was still uncontrollably flying towards the ruins of the remnant realms.</p><p></p><p>And the speed was getting faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>"If I crash into it like this, even if I am the Heavenly God Sword..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Li Ping frowned to himself. "If I'm not careful, my body and soul will be destroyed."</p><p></p><p>But he quickly locked onto the Rainbow Light of the Wanxian Alliance ahead of him. </p><p></p><p>For some reason, that Rainbow Light showed no signs of slowing down at all.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it actively sped up again, rushing forward.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, the Holy Fetus Li Fan resolutely followed closely.</p><p></p><p>As if confirming Li Fan's guess, after going deep into the Remnant Boundary Sea for a distance, the Rainbow Light actually ignored the suction of the high wall, and suddenly turned in a direction, flying towards one of the remnant world fragments.</p><p></p><p>It was as if there was some kind of attraction there that was stronger than the circling star power of the high wall.</p><p></p><p>An inexplicable sense of unease flashed through the Holy Fetus Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma Heavenly Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>After getting close to where the Rainbow Light turned, he also felt that power.</p><p></p><p>However, under the warning in his heart, the Holy Fetus Li Fan did not follow and fly over.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he continued to fly towards the depths of the Remnant Boundary Sea for a period of time. Due to the possible influence of the Dharma power, Li Fan's speed was able to slowly decrease.</p><p></p><p>Finally finding a stable point, he finally stabilized.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Ping also knew that this stability was only temporary.</p><p></p><p>As long as that suspected Dharma power disappeared, he would once again rush uncontrollably towards the high wall.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan tried to fly into the broken worlds here to hide.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the corpses of these worlds obviously would not provide shelter for cultivators like the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It looks like I'm going to die soon."</p><p></p><p>Just as the Holy Fetus Li Fan was thinking this, not far away, where the Rainbow Light of the Wanxian Alliance had gone.</p><p></p><p>The sudden disappearance of an aura made him shudder.</p><p></p><p>Before he could react, the second and third auras of Dao-Unifying cultivators disappeared one after another.</p><p></p><p>Dao-Unifying cultivators, even if they were fast-tracked Dao-Unifying cultivators, were ultimately the strongest beings below the Eternal Life Realm.</p><p></p><p>The existence that countless cultivators dreamed of.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, in this dark void, inside the Remnant Boundary Wall, they died silently without even making a bit of struggling noise.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" </p><p></p><p>"Was it the Dharma that made a move?"</p><p></p><p>"Painstakingly calling them over, just to slaughter them?"</p><p></p><p>While the Holy Fetus Li Fan was shocked and doubtful in his heart, the speed at which the Dao-Unifying cultivators disappeared from the Rainbow Light of the Wanxian Alliance did not decrease.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, all sixteen Dao-Unifying cultivators died.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, Huan Dao Yu Tian..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly thought of something, and hurriedly gathered his spirit to sense the place where the Rainbow Light disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Although the life aura of the cultivators had disappeared, the power of the laws of heaven and earth still vaguely existed there.</p><p></p><p>But it was slowly and regularly weakening, like ice gradually melting into water.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." Li Fan's heart shook, knowing what had just happened.</p><p></p><p>And then, the originally turbulent Remnant Boundary Sea inexplicably became stable again.</p><p></p><p>This further proved Li Fan's judgment.</p><p></p><p>"Actually using the Essence of Heaven and Earth within the bodies of Dao-Unifying cultivators to repair the Remnant Boundary Wall?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was both shocked and angry.</p><p></p><p>"Going to such great lengths, just to rob Peter to pay Paul?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan only felt it was extremely absurd.</p><p></p><p>But then, the complete stabilization of the Remnant Boundary Wall and the gradual weakening of the circling star power of the high wall.</p><p></p><p>All of this made him have no choice but to believe it.</p><p></p><p>Although in his heart, he really wanted to rush to where the Rainbow Light disappeared to take a look.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the Holy Fetus Li Ping was not yet ready to face the Dharma directly. Especially since his Holy Fetus body was also formed from the Sword Laws of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Rushing over recklessly, I'm afraid the outcome would only be the same as those sixteen Dao-Unifying cultivators, becoming materials for repairing the Remnant Boundary Wall.</p><p></p><p>Although the Holy Fetus Li Fan was not afraid of death, dying like this would be too depressing.</p><p></p><p>"The great upheaval in the Xuanhuang Realm originated from the circling star power of the high wall."</p><p></p><p>"According to the scene before us, there seems to be a subtle balance between this circling star power and the Remnant Boundary Wall. Under normal circumstances, it is not enough to spread to the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"So, it was because the Remnant Boundary Wall was out of balance due to external forces, which caused the Star Sea upheaval?" </p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"This remnant world ruins that have existed since ancient times will have an imbalance."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan couldn't help but recall the matter of him destroying a remnant boundary in the Xuanhuang Realm's Chizha Abyss before.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, a figure suspected to be the Dharma appeared and patched it up with a new world fragment.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart suddenly felt a sense of being unable to laugh or cry.</p><p></p><p>"What is this? Dismantling the east wall to repair the west wall, then dismantling the west wall to repair the east wall?"</p><p></p><p>After some pondering, Li Fan felt that the possibility of this being the case was still very high.</p><p></p><p>"After all, from the current real situation, it really allowed him to turn this catastrophe around."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>He carefully recalled and reviewed the details of this matter.</p><p></p><p>"There are still some strange points."</p><p></p><p>"If the state of the Remnant Boundary Wall is so easily broken, then the Dharma should have been extremely cautious when taking away the world fragments. Doing things so carelessly is not the Dharma's style at all."</p><p></p><p>"Unless the operating mechanism of this Remnant Boundary Wall is too mysterious, and even the Dharma only has a partial understanding. Or..."</p><p></p><p>"That node inside the Chizha Abyss is crucial to the Xuanhuang Realm again. It cannot be lost. So even if it would lead to an imbalance in the Remnant Boundary Wall, the Dharma had no choice but to do so."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan's thoughts turned rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Under the current conditions, it was impossible to determine which guess was correct.</p><p></p><p>But now it could be confirmed that the Dharma Heavenly Venerable was inside this Remnant Boundary Wall.</p><p></p><p>Or, it was the Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan carefully concealed his aura again, not acting rashly, but quietly hiding.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the energy here was quite complex and chaotic.</p><p></p><p>Although the circling star power was suppressed by the Remnant Boundary Wall, it had already set off waves of ripples in the void like waves.</p><p></p><p>It well concealed the little bit of fluctuation that Li Fan had left exposed.</p><p></p><p>He patiently waited for more than ten days, until the warning in his heart completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the Holy Fetus Li Fan slowly fly towards where the Rainbow Light disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Flying very slowly, a distance that could originally be reached in the blink of an eye, he spent a full half a day.</p><p></p><p>After making sure that no one was there, Li Fan only then began to observe the small world he was in.</p><p></p><p>It seemed no different from the other world fragments here.</p><p></p><p>But for some reason, Li Fan always had a sense of familiarity with this place.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is..."</p><p></p><p>After a while, Li Fan realized.</p><p></p><p>"Congyu Sea..."</p>

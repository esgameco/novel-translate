        <div class="content">
            <p>"It's not some special elixir. It's just a weakened version of the Heart's Desire Ascension Pill, which simultaneously accelerates the outbreak of the Immortal Miasma within the cultivator's body..."</p><p></p><p>"So you're saying that even without this so-called special medicine, we could have endured it on our own?"</p><p></p><p>Compared to Kou Hong, Dao Xuanzi appeared much calmer.</p><p></p><p>However, he still clenched his fists tightly, his face looking unwell.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder I've been feeling a bit mentally dazed from time to time recently. Wanting to do something, but feeling a bit lost and at a loss. It turns out it was all because of this Heart's Desire Ascension Pill!" Kou Hong gritted his teeth, suddenly realizing.</p><p></p><p>"To think that we two brothers were even grateful and joined the Myriad Immortal Alliance overnight..."</p><p></p><p>Feeling deceived and greatly insulted, Kou Hong stood up abruptly.</p><p></p><p>"No, the more I think about it, the angrier I get."</p><p></p><p>"I can't stay in this Myriad Immortal Alliance for a moment longer!"</p><p></p><p>With his fiery temper, Kou Hong made a decision on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Wait!" Ji Shaoli reached out to stop him.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I know you're feeling indignant, Brother Kou. But..."</p><p></p><p>"Have you considered the consequences of leaving the Myriad Immortal Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli said meaningfully, "I've never heard of anyone living well after leaving the Myriad Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong raised his eyebrows and said angrily, "So what? I, Kou Hong, am not one to fear death for the sake of life."</p><p></p><p>"At worst, I'll make the secret of this special medicine public! Perish together with them!"</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, no matter what, I will definitely not stay in this Myriad Immortal Alliance anymore! It simply makes me feel disgusted!"</p><p></p><p>Dao Xuanzi also stood up, apparently making the same decision as Kou Hong.</p><p></p><p>"You two are truly righteous and heroic!"</p><p></p><p>"I indeed didn't misjudge you!" Ji Shaoli applauded and praised.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean by that, Daoist friend?" Dao Xuanzi asked, his eyes flashing.</p><p></p><p>"I also believe that the Immortal Alliance is unrighteous. We cultivators should unite to overthrow them and restore a bright and clear world in the Xuanhuang Realm!" Ji Shaoli's face turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi were startled and glanced at each other, instantly becoming much more polite to Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>But they just had a problem with the Myriad Immortal Alliance, they weren't fools.</p><p></p><p>They were merely at the Golden Core stage, while the Myriad Immortal Alliance had countless Nascent Soul and Dao Integration powerhouses...</p><p></p><p>Overthrow the Myriad Immortal Alliance? </p><p></p><p>What a joke.</p><p></p><p>The two of them pretended not to have heard Ji Shaoli's words and were about to take their leave.</p><p></p><p>But how could Ji Shaoli let them leave so easily?</p><p></p><p>In this small secret room, he forcibly educated them about the existence of the [Myriad Realms United Association].</p><p></p><p>In short, after he finished speaking, Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi had already changed from their previous desire to avoid it at all costs to being eager to join.</p><p></p><p>"The so-called most solid fortress is often breached from the inside."</p><p></p><p>"Our Congyu Mutual Aid Society is a nail driven into the Immortal Alliance! Hidden and not acting, until one day when the time is ripe, we will completely bury the Myriad Immortal Alliance!" Ji Shaoli's tone was very resolute.</p><p></p><p>"You two, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at Ji Shaoli's earnest and enthusiastic gaze, Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi still hesitated a bit.</p><p></p><p>You should know, this was different from when they were rogue cultivators and could speak without restraint. This was truly risking getting their heads chopped off!</p><p></p><p>But things had come to this point. Now that they knew the secret of the Myriad Realms United Association, if they didn't agree, they probably wouldn't be able to safely leave this secret room today.</p><p></p><p>The two brothers were hesitating when Ji Shaoli once again raised the stakes.</p><p></p><p>"Do you two know why our Congyun Mutual Aid Association, established only a few years ago, has been able to attract countless cultivators who come to join us?"</p><p></p><p>"Apart from the so-called mutual assistance and resource sharing, the most fundamental reason is that the [Myriad Realms United Association] will select and cultivate core talents from among us."</p><p></p><p>"All cultivation resources will be made readily available."</p><p></p><p>"For example..."</p><p></p><p>"Nascent Soul Grotto-Heavens, Transformation of the Deity, and even the Essence of Heaven and Earth!"</p><p></p><p>Although Ji Shaoli's tone was light, it was like a thunderclap to the ears of Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong couldn't help but swallow his saliva: "Brother Ji, is this true?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli smiled slightly and nodded in confirmation.</p><p></p><p>"You two brothers were previously rogue cultivators, so you must know the difficulties of cultivation. Let's not even mention the Essence of Heaven and Earth or the Transformation of Life. Just take these Nascent Soul Grotto-Heavens, do you have the confidence to find them relying solely on your own luck?"</p><p></p><p>"If there's no hope of advancing to the Nascent Soul stage, don't tell me you're content with having your cultivation locked at the Golden Core realm for the rest of your lives?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's voice grew louder and louder, constantly echoing in the minds of Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes gradually changed, and they finally made up their minds.</p><p></p><p>"A real man living between heaven and earth, how can he be mediocre for a lifetime!" Kou Hong thought viciously.</p><p></p><p>"Such a heaven-sent opportunity must not be missed." Dao Xuanzi also said with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Very good! Then let us hold the initiation ceremony again. The real initiation ceremony." Ji Shaoli laughed loudly.</p><p></p><p>Following that, the mysterious and unfathomable faceless stone statue appeared once more above the secret room.</p><p></p><p>After reciting with some changes to the content, they felt as if their minds were shackled with an invisible set of fetters.</p><p></p><p>The two brothers looked at each other, secretly alarmed in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Since we're all family now, let me speak frankly." Ji Shaoli warmly pulled the two to sit down at the stone table in the secret room.</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, your two Foundation Establishment Wondrous Items are the Dao Xuan Sword and the Qiu Long Branch, right?" Ji Shaoli asked.</p><p></p><p>How did he see through this?</p><p></p><p>The two brothers were so shocked they wanted to stand up on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Indicating for the two not to be surprised, Ji Shaoli spoke bluntly again: "I see that you two brothers have innate talent. However, you've been held back by the quality of these Foundation Establishment Wondrous Items."</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention Heaven-rank or Earth-rank items, even if you switch to high-grade Human-rank items, your future prospects can be said to be limitless."</p><p></p><p>Even though the two brothers were very confident, they couldn't withstand Ji Shaoli's praise.</p><p></p><p>Their old faces turned red, and they were about to humbly say a few words.</p><p></p><p>But they were instantly captivated by what Ji Shaoli said next.</p><p></p><p>"Our Mutual Aid Association selects core members not based on aptitude or talent, but on their character!"</p><p></p><p>"As long as their character meets the requirements, we will help them..."</p><p></p><p>"Defy the heavens and change their fate!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong's breath caught: "Defy the heavens and change fate? But we have already..."</p><p></p><p>"That's right. Have you two ever heard of the [Re-establishing the Dao] method?" Ji Shaoli said enticingly.</p><p></p><p>"The Re-establishing the Dao method allows a cultivator to establish a new foundation without affecting their original cultivation and magic power at all. Moreover, they can slowly use the new foundation to devour and replace the original foundation. In this way, they can silently complete the transformation and make up for all past flaws..."</p><p></p><p>As Ji Shaoli spoke, Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi's breathing became more and more rapid.</p><p></p><p>"There's actually such a heaven-defying method in the world?"</p>

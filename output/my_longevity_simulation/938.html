        <h1>Chapter 938</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"This move is truly brilliant!"</p><p></p><p>The power of the five Patriarchs would indeed recover soon. </p><p></p><p>By then, in the face of the Eternal Realm, all the advantages established would vanish in an instant.</p><p></p><p>But if before that, all the people of the Five Elders Council were captured...</p><p></p><p>What would be left for the five Patriarchs is just a vast and empty land.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know much about the Eternal Realm, Li Fan was certain that even the most ordinary cultivators would be useful to these five Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps reducing some wouldn't have much impact.</p><p></p><p>But if he controlled the realm, and cultivators, even mortals, were all gone...</p><p></p><p>It would definitely be a major blow to them.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Five Elders Council of this world is really going to be defeated like this?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but think so in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In the next few days, the war proceeded very smoothly.</p><p></p><p>The balance of victory kept tilting towards the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But after all, it was a behemoth that had been passed down for thousands of years. When it was about to be driven into a desperate situation, the Five Elders Council finally erupted with a powerful force of resistance.</p><p></p><p>The scene in the Heavenly Profound Mirror suddenly switched to a sky.</p><p></p><p>From the oval-shaped door, a team of cultivators flew out in unison.</p><p></p><p>They were obviously not from the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But their clothing style was also not the same as the current Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>On their clothes, the same mysterious patterns were embroidered uniformly.</p><p></p><p>These cultivators looked at the neat rows of black-clothed formations not far away, and their faces revealed excited smiles one after another, eager to have a try.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... the Supreme Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the somewhat familiar sect emblem and frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>The scene in the Heavenly Profound Mirror changed again.</p><p></p><p>One after another, doors appeared. Those many ancient sects that were said to have been destroyed actually reappeared in the world at this time.</p><p></p><p>And joined the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Not only that.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Profound Mirror focused again, recording an unbelievable scene.</p><p></p><p>A female cultivator wearing a white tight-fitting outfit with a graceful figure, not knowing where she was, was slowly kowtowing towards a closed golden door in the void ahead, emanating an ancient and sacred aura.</p><p></p><p>As the light disappeared, what appeared in the mirror were more than a dozen figures identical to this white-clothed female cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Their appearances were exactly the same, only with subtle differences in age and strength.</p><p></p><p>It was as if...</p><p></p><p>The white-clothed female cultivator at different ages.</p><p></p><p>Without saying a word of nonsense, these white-clothed female cultivators rushed towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Sect Armory?" A flash of brilliance appeared in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The information about the Immortal Sect Armory that he had collected before surged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Sect Armory was an existence similar to the Heavenly Profound Mirror of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>There, the various techniques, scriptures, and treasures from the vast ancient immortal sects could be exchanged at will by cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The resources needed were not contribution points, but soul points.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan already knew before that there were also real illusions of many ancient sects from the ancient times in the Immortal Sect Armory.</p><p></p><p>What created the real illusions was a power extremely similar to the Fallen Immortal Realm. There, the Five Elders Council cultivators could travel through many extinct ancient sects. There were still many images of ancient cultivators in the sects. Most of them didn't have their own consciousness, just simple bodies. But in actual combat, the power in their every move was almost no different from real people.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders Council cultivators could consume soul points to fight with these ancient...</p><p></p><p>The warriors continuously practiced and honed their combat skills. Moreover, in the [Immortal Sect Armory], all injuries would not affect their physical bodies in reality, only causing slight damage to their souls. What's even more amazing is that this kind of soul injury can also be healed by consuming soul points.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically speaking, as long as one has enough soul points, even a mortal who has just started cultivating can become extremely powerful through countless battles.</p><p></p><p>"Are these summoned beings the projections of myself left in the Immortal Sect Armory by consuming soul points?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan instantly understood the origin of these cultivators who were like clones.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, Li Fan's guess was not wrong.</p><p></p><p>Similar scenes were happening in various parts of the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>As the golden ancient gate continuously projected rays of light, the remaining resistance forces of the Five Elders Council instantly expanded more than tenfold.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these cultivators who could leave their projections in the Immortal Sect Armory were all veterans of hundreds of battles.</p><p></p><p>With their extremely rich combat experience, their appearance caused great damage to the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, as long as their true bodies did not die, after resting for a period of time, they could summon their projections from the Immortal Sect Armory again by consuming soul power.</p><p></p><p>It was almost equivalent to infinite resurrection.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance's offensive slowed down.</p><p></p><p>And not long after the stalemate appeared, another force joined the battle.</p><p></p><p>The scene in the Heavenly Profound Mirror changed.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be disturbed by something, and the image shown in the mirror was a bit blurry.</p><p></p><p>It was like a continuous city built on the sky.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators in the city were all in deep slumber.</p><p></p><p>Slightly trembling, the cultivators all woke up.</p><p></p><p>There was no confusion after waking up from a long sleep, but anger on their faces for being disturbed from a beautiful dream.</p><p></p><p>Cursing and swearing, without any visible movement, their clothes turned into fully-enclosed, liquid metal-like battle armor.</p><p></p><p>They flew towards the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The scene in the Heavenly Profound Mirror suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be forcibly interrupted.</p><p></p><p>"That place is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was a bit stunned: "The Land of No Worries?"</p><p></p><p>The Land of No Worries was the most mysterious place in the territory of the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>It was the dreamland of all cultivators, and only those who passed the test could enter.</p><p></p><p>And once one went to the Land of No Worries, few would return.</p><p></p><p>In that fleeting glimpse just now, Li Fan also saw many interesting things in that illusory city in the sky.</p><p></p><p>For example, skyscrapers and neon lights like those in modern cities.</p><p></p><p>For example, the rainbow-like aerial roads connecting many buildings.</p><p></p><p>For example, the shuttles constantly flying through the city.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The power of no worries almost covers the entire Xuanhuang Realm. The Celestial Venerable of No Worries should be the strongest among the five of them."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>That place looked extremely similar to the future cultivation world scenes Li Fan had seen in the era.</p><p></p><p>"If possible, it would be nice to use a clone to travel there."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a feeling that he should be able to find some interesting things in the Land of No Worries.</p><p></p><p>The joining of the cultivators from the Land of No Worries completely turned the tide of the battle.</p><p></p><p>Although their cultivation was not that great, the magic treasures on their bodies were truly formidable.</p><p></p><p>That metal battle armor could absorb most attacks and then reflect them back.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, each cultivator carried almost endless energy beams.</p><p></p><p>With a single thought, they unfurled behind them.</p><p></p><p>Then they began to bombard the cultivators of the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1053: Meeting of the Law Transmitters</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, there's finally some progress."</p><p></p><p>"Not only has the acting become more realistic, but the schemes are also starting to take shape."</p><p></p><p>The white-haired elder commented.</p><p></p><p>The leading black-robed cultivator became anxious: "Senior, you've truly misunderstood!"</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly ordered his companions to release the formation restraining the white-haired elder: "Senior, you are now free. Surely this can't still be an act, right?"</p><p></p><p>The white-haired elder narrowed his eyes slightly: "I personally created the Underworld Prison back then. If I truly wanted to leave, how could it possibly confine me?"</p><p></p><p>"You can't even figure out this much..."</p><p></p><p>The white-haired elder's eyes grew even more distrustful.</p><p></p><p>"I told you they're all liars. Senior, you should come with me instead. I'm alone, so even if I wanted to scheme against you, I wouldn't be a match for you." Li Fan, who had been observing the situation, said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>However, despite his words, he made no move to approach and welcome the white-haired elder over.</p><p></p><p>"You little..." The white-haired elder found it somewhat difficult to understand the young man before him.</p><p></p><p>The mission, which had originally been proceeding exceptionally smoothly, had reached a stalemate in a way no one had anticipated.</p><p></p><p>With each passing second, there was a possibility of being discovered by the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The leading cultivator, left with no choice, grew increasingly anxious.</p><p></p><p>Gritting his teeth, he had already begun to consider taking action to subdue the white-haired elder by force and bring him back.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a clear sigh suddenly rang out above everyone's heads.</p><p></p><p>"Old Wai, you're still so self-righteous."</p><p></p><p>The moment the voice appeared, the black-robed cultivators' faces lit up with joy: "Senior Zhou!"</p><p></p><p>As for the white-haired elder, also known as Law Transmitter Wai, the aura around him abruptly changed.</p><p></p><p>His originally turbid eyes instantly erupted with a brilliant light, staring straight upward.</p><p></p><p>A woman in white plain clothes with a beautiful face had quietly appeared at some point.</p><p></p><p>Law Transmitter Wai carefully discerned for a moment and was slightly stunned: "It really is you..."</p><p></p><p>He looked at the group of black-robed cultivators before him, his expression becoming somewhat peculiar: "So, what these little ones said was true?"</p><p></p><p>Law Transmitter Zhou let out another sigh.</p><p></p><p>"When you think too much about conspiracies and schemes, everything looks fake."</p><p></p><p>"Many things have happened in the Myriad Immortal Alliance recently. I suspect the Law Transmitter Council has become corrupt, so I wanted to invite you out."</p><p></p><p>"However, if I had personally made an appearance, I would have definitely seen your smug face. That's why I sent these little ones instead."</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought..."</p><p></p><p>Law Transmitter Zhou's tone was somewhat strange, listless and dispirited.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the white-haired elder's expression froze for a moment.</p><p></p><p>To divert his gaze, he immediately locked his eyes on Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Since you're real, then what's the deal with this little one?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression remained unperturbed as he cupped his hands in greeting: "Greetings to the two seniors."</p><p></p><p>"This farce was merely to meet you both."</p><p></p><p>Wai and Zhou glanced at each other, both revealing a look of interest on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"The people from the Myriad Immortal Alliance will arrive soon. Let's change locations."</p><p></p><p>Law Transmitter Zhou waved her hand in the air, opening a spatial passage. She led the group of black-robed cultivators into it.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired elder looked back at Li Fan: "Little one, do you have the guts to follow us in?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, then...</p><p></p><p>Qi followed and entered the small world.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? This place..."</p><p></p><p>After seeing the surroundings clearly, Li Fan almost thought he had fallen into another illusion.</p><p></p><p>Because the architectural style of this small world was extremely similar to the world Li Fan lived in before he crossed over.</p><p></p><p>Skyscrapers stood tall and dense.</p><p></p><p>In the dark night sky, a drizzle was falling.</p><p></p><p>The numerous neon lights on the exterior walls of the buildings adorned the city under the night with a dazzling and bizarre appearance.</p><p></p><p>This somewhat distant yet very familiar scene made Li Fan dazed for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Not only him.</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Wei also had some trouble adapting.</p><p></p><p>"How is it? It looks quite nice, right? I went to the Land of No Worries for a vacation before and thought this kind of scenery was pretty good. So I just copied it over." </p><p></p><p>The voice of Dharma Transmitter Zhou slowly came through.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked towards the voice and saw that she had already changed into a different set of clothes.</p><p></p><p>A neat white shirt and tight pants.</p><p></p><p>She even wore a pair of black-framed glasses on her face.</p><p></p><p>She didn't look like a Dharma Transmitter, but more like a fashionable urban woman.</p><p></p><p>"Still so unreasonable." Dharma Transmitter Wei shook his head slightly, not daring to agree.</p><p></p><p>"You're still so stuck in the past and annoying." Dharma Transmitter Zhou also said sarcastically.</p><p></p><p>"I think it's quite good. Especially this outfit, it suits you very well, senior." Li Fan interjected at this time.</p><p></p><p>The gazes of the two Dharma Transmitters fell on Li Fan at the same time.</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, young people's taste is so much better than some old things. This is also why I like to collect young people." Dharma Transmitter Zhou looked at Li Fan and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, whatever your purpose is, you better speak directly. This old man's patience is very limited." Dharma Transmitter Wei's face didn't look so good.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan could see that Wei's anger was just a pretense.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the three of them were already on the top floor of the tallest building in the city. Through the huge glass curtain wall, the prosperous city under the night could be taken in at a glance.</p><p></p><p>The entire floor had nothing else besides the central office desk, sofa, and the red carpet that covered the entire floor.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sat down casually against the sofa as if he were in his own home.</p><p></p><p>He then started to explain the reason for seeking out Dharma Transmitter Zhou: "I want to know what exactly happened at the Wanxian Alliance headquarters five years ago."</p><p></p><p>"And where the real Tianxuan Mirror is now."</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Wei had been locked up for many years and didn't understand the situation for a while.</p><p></p><p>As for Dharma Transmitter Zhou, the calm expression on her face slowly disappeared. She carefully sized up Li Fan, seeming to be guessing his background.</p><p></p><p>"Appearing in front of me out of nowhere and asking for such confidential matters as soon as you open your mouth."</p><p></p><p>"Little guy, where does your confidence come from?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou's tone gradually changed from languid to icy: "Just Yuanyuan cultivation. Even if the grotto heaven you devoured is a bit more vast, it's still only Yuanyuan realm after all."</p><p></p><p>"Dare to talk to me like this?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained unfazed: "When talking to you Dharma Transmitters, my tone has always been like this. The fact that you didn't directly make a move, but instead probed with words, doesn't that explain where my confidence lies?"</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere instantly became tense again.</p><p></p><p>But it shattered in an instant with Dharma Transmitter Zhou's charming smile.</p><p></p><p>"You're right."</p><p></p><p>"I haven't seen such an outstanding young man like you in a long time. Why don't you come and be my collectible?"</p><p></p><p>"If you're willing, whatever secrets you want to know, I can tell you."</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Zhou's tone became languid again like before.</p>

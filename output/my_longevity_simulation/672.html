        <h1>Chapter 672</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>As Li Fan regained consciousness from seclusion, he had already successfully advanced to the middle stage of the Yuan Ying realm.</p><p></p><p>"It has been anchored for seventeen years..."</p><p></p><p>"After all, with only the assistance of the Dao-enlightening pill, and lacking the awakening effect of the Tian Xuan Mirror, progress has been slow."</p><p></p><p>Checking his own condition, the size of the Five Elements cave in his body had expanded more than three times compared to the early Yuan Ying stage. Each cave was now brimming with vitality, no longer as silent and still as before. However, the manifestation of creations was still a bit far off. The circulation of the Five Elements' power had become much more agile, as if something was brewing within the cave world.</p><p></p><p>At present, Li Fan had completely mastered both his own Five Elements cave and this beast species little world. It could be said to be an existence similar to the laws of nature itself.</p><p></p><p>But upon close comparison, Li Fan also noticed many differences between the two.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements cave was stolen from the Xuan Huang Realm. Although it was reinforced using a new method and incorporated into his body, it was still impossible to completely control it, just like how one's own body or an ordinary person couldn't be fully controlled. The operation and evolution of the cave were mostly spontaneous actions of the cave itself, the result of some sort of natural law. Although he could clearly sense every change that occurred within the cave world, the current Li Fan still could not fully understand it, let alone make changes or creations at will.</p><p></p><p>The beast species world, on the other hand, was different. With just a thought, the world was filled with wind, rain, thunder, ice, snow, and flowing fire, all following his will. As long as Li Fan wished, the beast species world could be fixed in a certain state in an instant, and that state never changed in the future. At the same time, Li Fan could freely reshape the beast species world according to his desire. Raising mountains with a thought, flattening rivers with a thought, were all common occurrences.</p><p></p><p>"Under normal circumstances, even if one seizes all the luck of a small world using certain methods, it is impossible to reach a realm where one can control everything at will like I do in the early stages. It still requires years of insight and resonance with the origin of the world. However, Little Black has already done this for me. I am just inheriting its legacy and taking advantage of it."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the familiar image in the feathers of the dark bird within him, realizing it instantly.</p><p></p><p>Turning his attention back to the beast species world, after two years, there had been earth-shattering changes here. The spiritual energy density had soared to a level just below that of the Xuan Huang Realm, and the once desolate land had now become vibrant.</p><p></p><p>Various spirit plants and herbs were categorized and planted in the spirit fields, being diligently worked on by the beast species. However, he did not see the "Beast Control Ring" that Fang Zaiji mentioned before on their necks.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan scanned the entire world with his divine sense, finding only traces of control on the strongest few exotic beasts.</p><p></p><p>"If you can control above, you can control below. When dealing with these beast species, it indeed does not take much effort." </p><p></p><p>Liu San and Fang Zaiji were not present in the beast species world at that moment. Li Fan passed through the spatial passage, arriving in Changsheng Valley, only to find the two of them together, seemingly discussing something.</p><p></p><p>Feeling Li Fan's presence, both of them showed a hint of joy on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you've come out of seclusion!"</p><p></p><p>"What has happened? Why do I feel your expressions are a bit serious?" Li Fan asked as he stood in front of the two.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on your cultivation progress and further improvement!" Liu San inspected Li Fan with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji then explained to Li Fan the reason for their serious demeanor.</p><p></p><p>About half a year ago, a group of Wanxian League cultivators piloting Puxian Zhenzhou arrived in the White Mist. At first, Liu San thought their target was Changsheng Valley and reacted as if facing a formidable enemy. They even mobilized all the Medicine King Sect cultivators and remained prepared to flee at any time.</p><p></p><p>However, soon, Liu San realized that it was a false alarm. The Wanxian League cultivators did not stop at the entrance to Changsheng Valley but seemed to be heading further into the White Mist.</p><p></p><p>This relieved Liu San, thinking that Wanxian League cultivators might have just passed by accidentally.</p><p></p><p>But what happened next made Liu San realize his mistake. Over the past six months, every once in a while, dozens of zhenzhou filled with cultivators would sail into the depths of the White Mist. It felt like they were carrying out some sort of mission, emanating a solemn and murderous atmosphere. Occasionally, some cultivators would retreat from the depths of the White Mist, looking desolate and worried.</p><p></p><p>These cultivators' overall cultivation levels were not too high, but for safety, Liu San did not inspect too closely and just observed from afar.</p><p></p><p>Although the target of these Wanxian League cultivators was not the Medicine King Sect, their passing frequency was too high. No one could guarantee that, by sheer coincidence, they wouldn't discover the location of Changsheng Valley. And if they did, whether or not conflicts would arise with the Medicine King Sect.</p><p></p><p>So, during this time, Liu San and Fang Zaiji had been very vigilant.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a secret operation of the Wanxian League, or is it a conspicuous act? Do ordinary Wanxian League cultivators know about this?" After listening to their reports, Li Fan's eyes flickered as he asked.</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary cultivators are not aware of this. At least, that seems to be the case based on the information we have gathered," Fang Zaiji replied.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan said, "This matter seems suspicious. We must be prepared for changes. Let me go out and investigate the truth before making a decision."</p><p></p><p>Having great confidence in Li Fan's abilities, the two immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Liu San took out twelve jade bottles and handed them over, saying, "These are the pills I have refined during this period. Nine bottles contain a total of eighty-one Longevity Pills, two bottles contain twenty No-Mercy Pills. And one..."</p><p></p><p>Liu San paused, his expression a bit peculiar, "is the 'Ascension Pill of Mind.'"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your hard work, Master Liu." Li Fan collected the remaining pills, holding the bottle containing the Ascension Pill of Mind in his hand, ready to open and examine it.</p><p></p><p>He was suddenly stopped by Liu San.</p><p></p><p>"Is there anything wrong with this pill?" Li Fan asked with a furrowed brow.</p><p></p><p>Liu San smiled bitterly, "Although this pill is non-toxic, its actual harm is not inferior to any poisonous substance in the world."</p><p></p><p>"The Ascension Pill of Mind is a special pill that may be born during the refining of the No-Mercy Pill. After any cultivator swallows it, they will experience an illusion of understanding the Great Dao and about to become an immortal." Fang Zaiji explained at this time.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the more one consumes, the stronger this illusion becomes. Until finally, in order to taste the flavor of ascension, those addicted cultivators can do anything." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan instinctively held onto the jade bottle in his hand tightly.</p><p></p><p>He knew what this so-called Ascension Pill of Mind was.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, because of this pill, immense trouble was caused. Therefore, under the rule of the Ten Sects of Immortality, it is an absolute forbidden item. But from what our disciples have inquired about, the current Wanxian League seems to have no prohibition regarding this pill," Fang Zaiji added.</p>

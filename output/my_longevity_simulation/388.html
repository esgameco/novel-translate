        <h1>Chapter 388</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In today's world of cultivating immortality, even cultivating oneself is not an easy task. Who would still go spreading teachings and passing on knowledge to solve puzzles.</p><p></p><p>Since he embarked on the path of cultivation all these years ago, he has never seen a genuine master-disciple relationship.</p><p></p><p>Out of curiosity, Li Fan looked towards the direction where the voice came from.</p><p></p><p>He saw an old man and a young child standing beside the giant Dust Crossing Boat, both dressed in green robes. The old man had white hair but a youthful face with rosy cheeks, while the child had a weathered face, looking like someone who had seen through the world's affairs.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Li Fan was that the innocent child-like voice he had just heard came from the mouth of the elderly man with white hair.</p><p></p><p>He looked bewildered, full of curiosity, as he lowered his head to look at the child beside him and asked.</p><p></p><p>The child appeared to be only five or six years old, but the words coming out of his mouth were far beyond what a child could express.</p><p></p><p>"All things come from nothingness, and return to nothingness."</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elements return to one, it's just reverting to their original forms."</p><p></p><p>The child in green robes replied with a smile.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, the elderly man suddenly understood the answer, and joyfully said, "I know, Master, you mean that soon, this place will return to a chaotic void, just like what we saw before. Is that right?"</p><p></p><p>The child chuckled and looked at the old man with a serene expression, "You are right. If there is no external intervention allowing it to evolve freely, that would indeed be the case."</p><p></p><p>"But if one day, outsiders intrude here and take away some of the materials inside this cave, then things might not be as simple."</p><p></p><p>The child looked down at the Five Elements Cave below, sighing.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan was slightly stunned, squinting his eyes as he carefully observed the master and disciple in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The elderly man frowned as if pondering over his master's words.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he suddenly realized, "This cave, where the Five Elements circulate, blending into one, is flawless. It can either be divided into five elements or reunite the elements into one. However, if outsiders take a portion from each of the Five Elements, it will lead to an imbalance in the elements. And then..."</p><p></p><p>"And then..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, the old man seemed stuck, unable to come up with the next part.</p><p></p><p>The child in green robes chuckled and continued the narrative, "Actually, if it's just a small-scale, long-term extraction, the Five Elements Cave can rely on its own attributes to circulate and self-regulate, thus avoiding an imbalance in the Five Elements."</p><p></p><p>"It's when there's a sudden, large-scale plundering of resources from certain elemental caves within a short period of time..."</p><p></p><p>"If the adjustment mechanism of the cave is insufficient to cope with the expenditure, it will lead to a complete imbalance in the Five Elements Cave."</p><p></p><p>"Master, what will happen after a complete imbalance?" the old man in green robes asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>The child in green robes now stopped smiling, "Do you remember when I first introduced you to the concept of the Five Elements sect?"</p><p></p><p>The old man nodded, "The disciple remembers. The Five Elements sect is an affiliated sect of the Great Dao sect. A few years ago, when their sect master visited our Dust Crossing Sect, I saw him!"</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan listened in to the conversation between the master and disciple, he was greatly shaken.</p><p></p><p>He finally confirmed that the two people in front of him were not actually on the Dust Crossing Boat but rather a mirage, similar to a mirage in the desert!</p><p></p><p>The conversation between the master and disciple seemed to be happening in the ancient world of cultivating immortality before the Great Calamity, while the sect still existed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked around and found that people were coming and going on the Dust Crossing Boat, but for some reason, besides himself, no one else could see this illusionary scene.</p><p></p><p>Silent, Li Fan continued to observe the conversation between the ancient Dust Crossing Masters.</p><p></p><p>The child in green robes continued, "The Five Elements sect's strength was not weak back in the day. Apart from our Ten Immortal Sects, they were considered one of the top cultivation sects in the Xuanhuang realm. Within their sect, there was a hidden place named [Five Elements Heaven]. It was almost like a separate realm with abundant resources, almost infinite."</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the Five Elements Grand Cave here, it was far superior."</p><p></p><p>"Relying on this hidden place, if the Five Elements sect had continued to develop slowly, after hundreds or thousands of years, they might have easily risen to become one of the top sects in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the former sect master, Lan Xiangfeng, was short-sighted..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the child in green robes snorted coldly, a hint of resentment flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The elderly man widened his eyes, remaining silent, waiting for the continuation.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the child in green robes continued, "It was said that the Heavenly Sword Sect needed a large amount of [Taiyuan Essence Gold] to forge the legendary [Breaking Realm Divine Weapon]."</p><p></p><p>"This Taiyuan Essence Gold is extremely rare, only naturally occurring in metallic mineral veins, making it a chance encounter. The Heavenly Sword Sect had almost depleted all the resources they could find on the market and still fell short of the required amount."</p><p></p><p>"It was rumored that the Five Elements Heaven in the Five Elements sect might have a large stock. So the sect master of the Heavenly Sword Sect personally went to request it."</p><p></p><p>"That notoriously arrogant old man actually bowed down to the Five Elements sect. Lan Xiangfeng was immediately elated and lost his bearings."</p><p></p><p>"Add to that the excessively high price offered by the Heavenly Sword Sect, which swayed all the elders of the Five Elements sect."</p><p></p><p>"So, the Five Elements sect began a massive excavation of the [Taiyuan Essence Gold] from the hidden place. Just this action alone would not have led to the tragedy that followed."</p><p></p><p>"But they were misled by someone, saying that since various metallic ores were being unearthed during the excavation, it would be a waste not to sell them too. Other sects also heard about the abundance of metal ores in the Five Elements sect and came to purchase them."</p><p></p><p>"Driven by greed, the Five Elements sect's actions in excavating metallic veins became increasingly frenzied."</p><p></p><p>"Finding the labor insufficient, they even hired wandering cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"One day, due to the massive loss of metallic resources, the balance of the Five Elements within the Five Elements Heaven was disrupted."</p><p></p><p>"Unavoidably, it transformed into a state of annihilation towards a unified Five Elements."</p><p></p><p>"And, when the missing metallic element could no longer satisfy the need for a unified Five Elements, the remaining elements of wood, water, fire, and earth underwent uncontrolled and ceaseless energy collisions..."</p><p></p><p>"The ultimate result was a massive explosion that completely destroyed the Five Elements Heaven."</p><p></p><p>"The entire Five Elements sect suffered losses that could not be described as anything less than catastrophic. Their core strength was nearly wiped out, and they never recovered from the blow."</p><p></p><p>"In order to survive, they had to actively seek refuge with the Great Dao sect, relying on the old friendships from back then to become an affiliated sect."</p><p></p><p>As the child finished speaking, he sighed.</p><p></p><p>Listening in, Li Fan felt a chill creeping up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't the ordeal of the ancient Five Elements Heaven similar to the current situation in the Five Elements Grand Cave?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that after the Five Elements unite, a thunderous explosion would occur here too?</p><p></p><p>Cursing under his breath, Li Fan looked back at the Dust Crossing Masters, only to find their figures gradually becoming blurred.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1266</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"The original Dao meaning of the Starry Sea..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan repeatedly pondered the insights that were just transmitted from the Holy Emperor. </p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also vaguely sensed the current state of the Xuan-Huang Realm, reviving from the inside out.</p><p></p><p>"If there were no new Fa cultivators devouring the heavens and earth inside, and no Immortal Ruins outside, perhaps the Xuan-Huang Realm could truly be reborn."</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity... this is bound to treat the symptoms but not the root cause."</p><p></p><p>While shaking his head slightly, a trace of doubt also emerged in his heart. Logically speaking, it's impossible for the Xuan-Huang Dao not to know this. Instead of accumulating this bit of revival power to erupt in the decisive battle in the future, it is impatiently evolving and spreading out.</p><p></p><p>What is the reason for this?</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, let me wait and see."</p><p></p><p>The perspective returned to the Great Sheng Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>After sensing the changes in the Xuan-Huang Realm, the Stone Tablet immediately came to the Holy Emperor's seat. Seeing the Holy Emperor also surging with profound aura, the Stone Tablet was instantly startled.</p><p></p><p>"You already know what happened in the Xuan-Huang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"No need to panic, it's beneficial and harmless." The Holy Emperor responded.</p><p></p><p>The Stone Tablet's expression eased slightly: "I thought the Xuan-Huang Realm was facing a great calamity and having its last radiance before death..."</p><p></p><p>"What you said is not wrong. The revival power bursting out from a momentary enlightenment is destined not to last long. But for us, it may be a rare opportunity."</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, the Holy Emperor said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"You mean, the Xuan-Huang Orthodox plan?" The Stone Tablet was slightly stunned, but quickly reacted.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor nodded, and a miniature scene of the Xuan-Huang Realm appeared in front of the two.</p><p></p><p>Among it was the original part of the Xuan-Huang Realm, glowing in yellow.</p><p></p><p>And from the collapse of the Immortal Dao, the native forces of the Xuan-Huang Realm, the Xuan-Tian Sect, and the cave heavens and worlds captured by the Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao using the [Floating Crossing Starry Sky Grand Formation], showed a strange green color.</p><p></p><p>After the Great Calamity spread and the Starry Sea was destroyed, the remnants of other cultivation realms forcibly stitched by outsiders were in a dead black color.</p><p></p><p>This was the transmitted information from the Xuan-Huang Dao.</p><p></p><p>It could be seen that the yellow color only occupied about less than one-thirtieth of the entire miniature landscape of the Xuan-Huang Realm.</p><p></p><p>While the green color occupied one-tenth.</p><p></p><p>As for the rest, they were all large swathes of black.</p><p></p><p>The glowing yellow representing the Xuan-Huang Realm seemed to be an anomaly.</p><p></p><p>But unlike the green and black colors, the glowing color representing the Xuan-Huang Realm, as if having its own life consciousness, flickered and constantly overflowed and spread to the surrounding heterochromatic areas.</p><p></p><p>From a direct visual representation, the green and black areas were not pure.</p><p></p><p>They were mixed with specks of dark yellow.</p><p></p><p>However, over thousands of years, this erosion in a certain sense had become slower and slower. There was even a trend of being backwashed.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>"The Xuan-Huang Orthodox..."</p><p></p><p>The Stone Tablet pondered: "Those areas that originally belonged to the Xuan-Huang Realm naturally need no further explanation. Everything that happens in them is recorded in detail by the Creation Stone Tablet. As for those green areas..."</p><p></p><p>The Stone Tablet carefully distinguished: "Some are within the scope of the Stone Tablet's records, while others are not."</p><p></p><p>"As for those black areas, they are purely blind spots."</p><p></p><p>Holy Emperor Li Ping said, "If we do nothing, the final outcome of the Xuan-Huang Realm will be engulfed by those black areas that occupy an absolute advantage in quantity. As for the future, these black areas will probably evolve into another form."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, we need to take a step ahead and deeply inject the Xuan-Huang Orthodox into these foreign remnant domains."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's voice was low, but the determination in his words was evident.</p><p></p><p>"How to do it?" The Stone Tablet became interested.</p><p></p><p>"Observe the Dao of Heaven, execute the actions of Heaven..."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor explained slowly, and the Stone Tablet listened carefully, nodding from time to time.</p><p></p><p>After explaining the method in detail, the Holy Emperor's tone became a little solemn: "When doing these, we need to be careful and cautious to prevent being discovered by the mastermind."</p><p></p><p>Although the Holy Emperor did not explicitly say who it was, the Stone Tablet understood his meaning.</p><p></p><p>The Stone Tablet rarely showed a playful smile: "The so-called 'moistening things silently'. This method is so hidden, coupled with the active cooperation and concealment of the Xuan-Huang Dao, I think even if that person has unparalleled cultivation, he will not be able to detect it."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor said solemnly, "We must not be careless. Even if he is not in the Xuan-Huang Realm, we must guard against the various backups he left behind."</p><p></p><p>The Stone Tablet nodded, indicating that he knew.</p><p></p><p>"For this matter, the fewer participants in the action, the better. It should have been that Ruo-Mu to come, which would be the most efficient. After all, as a primordial tree spirit, he has a closer connection with the Xuan-Huang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"It's not that I don't trust him, but Ruo-Mu's every move will attract the attention of other powerful figures in this realm. As an action party, he is too conspicuous. On the contrary, people think that you are deeply oppressed by the Creation Stone Tablet and under constant pressure, so they will subconsciously ignore you." Perhaps because it concerned the future of the Xuan-Huang Realm, the Holy Emperor rarely rambled on for a few sentences.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be talking to the Stone Tablet, but also seemed to be talking to Ruo-Mu.</p><p></p><p>"This is the so-called 'the darkest place is under the candlestick'?" The Stone Tablet nodded in agreement, "Now that I have lost the weight of the Stone Tablet, I will make some changes. I guarantee that in this Xuan-Huang Realm, no one will associate me with my past image."</p><p></p><p>"Then wait a few days until the revival power released by the Xuan-Huang Realm this time reaches its peak, and then take action. It can achieve twice the result with half the effort."</p><p></p><p>The Stone Tablet immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>He didn't leave either, just stood quietly in the hall of the Holy Emperor's seat, watching the miniature scene of the Xuan-Huang Realm transformed by the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The light in the center of the Xuan-Huang Realm kept flashing. Like a beating heart, it transported strands of Xuan-Huang color to all parts of the Xuan-Huang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Including those green and black areas.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to take action." The Faceless Holy Emperor said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The Stone Tablet smiled slightly, his figure flashed, and in an instant, it split into two completely identical bodies in the Holy Emperor's seat.</p><p></p><p>Then two became four, four turned into eight, and eight increased to sixteen.</p><p></p><p>In just the blink of an eye, countless densely packed and completely identical figures of the Stone Tablet filled the hall.</p><p></p><p>"Change! Change! Change!"</p><p></p><p>The Stone Tablets said in unison.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Stone Tablet clones transformed into various real existing figures in the Xuan-Huang Realm.</p><p></p><p>There were dashing white-robed scholars, stooped woodcutters, peerlessly beautiful women, and frivolous old men...</p><p></p><p>Each person's appearance was extremely vivid, and it was impossible to tell that they were transformed from the same person.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going."</p><p></p><p>They each saluted the Holy Emperor, all with smiles on their faces, and their figures disappeared from the Holy Emperor's seat.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in various states of the Xuan-Huang Realm, without anyone being able to detect it.</p><p></p><p>Some special existences were added.</p><p></p><p>When they all gathered in the Holy Emperor's seat,</p><p></p><p>In the crowded Xuanhuang Realm, they dispersed without making a ripple.</p><p></p><p>"Observe the way of heaven, and follow its course."</p><p></p><p>"When heaven and man unite, all changes will have a foundation..."</p><p></p><p>They chanted softly as they headed towards the cities where mortals gathered in each state.</p><p></p><p>The Sage Emperor's plan was simple.</p><p></p><p>It was to use human will to establish the foundation of heaven.</p><p></p><p>By utilizing the stone tablet's ability to disguise itself in any form, countless avatars were created and infiltrated into the mortal population.</p><p></p><p>They subtly preached the existence of the "Xuanhuang Realm" to all mortal beings in Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Currently, mortals only knew the corner of the world they lived in. They had no special awareness of this world, the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The concept of the Xuanhuang Realm itself did not exist in their minds.</p><p></p><p>The first step in establishing Xuanhuang's orthodoxy was to popularize the existence of the Xuanhuang Realm they lived in.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this could not be accomplished overnight. It required years or even decades of dissemination.</p><p></p><p>To avoid arousing suspicion, they needed to tirelessly integrate into the mortal population and spread the word through word of mouth.</p><p></p><p>However, with the power of the stone tablet, even if there were thousands of avatars, it was not a difficult task.</p><p></p><p>A single mortal, hundreds, or thousands were as insignificant as ants, but if all the mortals in the Xuanhuang Realm were combined, it would be a force that could not be ignored.</p><p></p><p>Once the mortal population of the Xuanhuang Realm reached a consensus, the second step of the plan could be carried out.</p><p></p><p>With the will of the "myriad beings of heaven and earth," they would launch a synchronized counterattack and annihilate the remnant consciousness of those foreign immortal cultivation remnant realms.</p><p></p><p>This step required the assistance of Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>As a ghostly existence of the world, he had a profound understanding of how to devour the consciousness of a world.</p><p></p><p>After cooperating with the Xuanhuang Dao to complete the encirclement and suppression of the immortal cultivation remnant realms, the final step was to help the remnant realms fully integrate into Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>In fact, most regions of the Xuanhuang Realm had already completed superficial integration.</p><p></p><p>Only a few states still experienced frequent anomalies due to improper integration.</p><p></p><p>These "festering wounds" required thorough cleansing and reconstruction.</p><p></p><p>If the first and second steps could be concealed, the third step would definitely alert the Wanxian Alliance and even the Chuanfa Tianzun beyond the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>At that time, there would inevitably be a confrontation.</p><p></p><p>However, according to the Sage Emperor, as long as the second step was completed, even if they ultimately failed, the situation would be irreversible, and no one would be able to turn the tide.</p><p></p><p>Unless more immortal cultivation remnant realms were brought in and another round of dismemberment and reorganization was carried out over nearly 10,000 years.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet, which had not been excited about anything for a long time, felt its blood boiling at the Sage Emperor's plan.</p><p></p><p>In addition to saving the Xuanhuang Realm, the benefits were self-evident if it succeeded.</p><p></p><p>It would gain more authority over heaven and earth and become a stronger existence than Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the reason, the stone tablet would not refuse this plan.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Sage Emperor's seat.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping summoned Ruomu.</p><p></p><p>A true sage would not put all their eggs in one basket.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, he would not entrust such an important task as establishing Xuanhuang's orthodoxy solely to the stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>Even if the stone tablet was trustworthy and the plan had low risk, he said the same words as the stone tablet, only with a different phrasing.</p><p></p><p>The main body for achieving the goal became Ruomu.</p><p></p><p>And the "myriad beings of heaven and earth" that implanted the concept of the Xuanhuang Realm became the ordinary plants, birds, and beasts of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"As the ancestor of all living beings in the world, you should be able to subtly influence them."</p><p></p><p>"Establish the will of the 'Xuanhuang Realm.'"</p><p></p><p>This was a trivial matter for Ruomu.</p><p></p><p>The fact that withered branches had sprouted new leaves had also reinvigorated his spirit.</p><p></p><p>Rarely motivated, he readily agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Ruomu, stone tablet."</p><p></p><p>"They alone are not enough."</p><p></p><p>"In the end, I will need to personally take action for this matter."</p><p></p><p>"Only with three layers of insurance can it be considered foolproof."</p><p></p><p>The Sage Emperor's thoughts flowed slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Confronting the Wanxian Alliance is the battlefield on the surface."</p><p></p><p>"Establishing Xuanhuang's orthodoxy is the hidden battle."</p><p></p><p>"Comparatively, this hidden battle is even more important. There is only one chance; losing means a complete defeat."</p><p></p><p>As the Sage Emperor pondered, his forehead gradually bulged.</p><p></p><p>The flesh swelled, and a tumor kept growing.</p><p></p><p>After half a day, the flesh exploded, and a mass of Xuanhuang Qi burst out.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Qi swirled, and the image inside was hazy.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to resemble Mr. Bai a little, and also Li Ping himself.</p><p></p><p>"Mao Bao."</p><p></p><p>The faceless Sage Emperor woke up the dozing Mao Bao.</p><p></p><p>Pinching its neck, he reluctantly made it use its replication ability.</p><p></p><p>Another mass of Xuanhuang Qi, identical to the first, appeared in the Sage Emperor's seat.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>With a shout from the Sage Emperor, the two masses of Xuanhuang Qi tore through the void, leaving the Sage Court's small world and flying towards different states in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>They did not directly merge with the Dao but lurked in secret.</p><p></p><p>The Sage Emperor coughed lightly. Even with his strength, he felt a slight, temporary weakness.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Qi that split from his body could be considered the Xuanhuang evil thoughts he had swallowed in the past.</p><p></p><p>However, after being refined by him and blended with the Sage Court's fortune from the "Emperor's Qi Scripture," it became an existence similar to the embodiment of Xuanhuang's fortune.</p><p></p><p>If he had not ventured into the starry sea and witnessed the true meaning of its origin, it would have been difficult for him to condense this embodied fortune.</p><p></p><p>"Each embodied fortune can be integrated into and govern about three states."</p><p></p><p>"Putting aside the Five Elders, with Mao Bao's assistance, it won't take long to cover the entire Wanxian Alliance."</p><p></p><p>After a few breaths, the Sage Emperor's aura returned to its peak of strength.</p><p></p><p>But Li Ping knew this was due to the support of the Sage Court's fortune reserves and the feedback from his own enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>If the condensation was too frequent, it would not recover so quickly.</p><p></p><p>"The integration of Xuanhuang's fortune into heaven and earth is equivalent to re-declaring sovereignty."</p><p></p><p>"Even if Ruomu and the stone tablet fail, Xuanhuang's orthodoxy will still be firmly controlled."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, it would be even better if they succeed."</p><p></p><p>In Li Ping's extrapolation, it was best to fight the Wanxian Alliance after establishing Xuanhuang's orthodoxy.</p><p></p><p>Because at that time, when dealing with these "heretics" of the Wanxian Alliance, it would be like fighting on home ground. With a single thought, he could ignore spatial distance and mobilize the power of Xuanhuang's Dao to bring down endless heavenly punishment.</p>

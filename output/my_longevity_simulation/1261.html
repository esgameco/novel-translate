        <h1>Chapter 1261</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The handwriting was extremely sloppy, with large sections of scribbles and deletion marks.</p><p></p><p>However, Sun Erlang could still grasp the general idea.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Dynasty ruled by the Taoist Emperor Tai Xuan was growing increasingly powerful, with talented individuals emerging one after another. In the struggles against the other two nations, they emerged victorious time and again.</p><p></p><p>The Master of Heaven and Earth and the Sage of the Human Realm had no choice but to join hands to resist the might of Tai Xuan...</p><p></p><p>This plot was clearly not what the writer truly wanted to write about.</p><p></p><p>Not only was the writing style and wording much weaker compared to before, even the attitude towards writing became perfunctory. Perhaps unable to bear it any longer, the writer was unwilling to continue writing before reaching the ending. He spent his days drinking and living in a daze.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang was not surprised by this outcome.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Awakening of the Holy Dynasty, the symbols on Taoist Emperor Tai Xuan and the Faceless Sacred Emperor were too similar. If he suffered even a little setback in the plot, the writer would be criticized by thousands. Under such real-life pressure, Taoist Emperor Tai Xuan naturally had to enjoy smooth sailing in the plot. As this continued, his strength surpassed the other two sages by a large margin.</p><p></p><p>However, Sun Erlang was a bit curious about what kind of plot development the writer originally had in mind.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Sun Erlang sent out a thread of divine sense, probing into the writer's sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Before long, amidst the chaotic thoughts, he found the content related to "The Romance of the Three Realms of Profound and Yellow".</p><p></p><p>It had to be said that the writer, after all, was a native of the Holy Dynasty. Having basked in the grace of the Sacred Emperor for many years, his subconscious reverence for the Sacred Emperor made the ending he envisioned still one where Taoist Emperor Tai Xuan overcame various difficulties and successively suppressed the other two victors, unifying the Profound Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, there were failures, setbacks, and even moments when he was on the verge of doom, his life hanging by a thread.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang had to admit that compared to the revised version he saw in reality, the original plot arrangement in the writer's mind was more ups and downs and gripping.</p><p></p><p>"As they say, writing is like viewing mountains - one does not enjoy flatness. In comparison, the outside version is indeed as bland as chewing on wax."</p><p></p><p>Although this was what Sun Erlang thought, the content of this book involved his master after all, so he dared not make decisions on his own.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, he returned to the Sacred Emperor's seat and reported the matter to Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>It was just a small matter, but for some reason, it made the Sacred Emperor silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Taoist Emperor Tai Xuan is me, the Sage of the Human Realm is me, and the Master of Heaven and Earth is also me."</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Sacred Emperor slowly uttered a sentence that echoed in the cold Sacred Emperor's seat.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang was stunned at first, but then he suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>He left with a delighted expression.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Ping's state of mind, which was usually difficult to shake by ordinary things, rarely rippled with waves that could not be calmed because of this matter.</p><p></p><p>He might have understood a little why Chuan Fa had stopped concerning himself with worldly affairs and disappeared from the public eye after establishing the League of Ten Thousand Immortals.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Hongze Realm.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ming, the Golden Core cultivator guarding this realm on behalf of the Holy Dynasty's Great Awakening, suddenly received a report from his subordinates.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that some uninvited guests from the League of Ten Thousand Immortals had intruded into this small world.</p><p></p><p>"Three Nascent Souls, seven Golden Cores."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ming's brows furrowed tightly.</p><p></p><p>"This Hongze Realm is not big, and the aura carried by the Kongming Flowing Crystals is very unique. Even though I have formation talismans to conceal it slightly, I'm afraid it will be difficult to escape the investigation of these people."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that this battle is inevitable."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ming quickly calculated the forces he could mobilize at present.</p><p></p><p>Including himself, there were only five Golden Cores at most.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that the disparity in strength was huge, and defeat was certain.</p><p></p><p>If he chose to retreat, the Holy Dynasty would not impose a very severe punishment.</p><p></p><p>However, the pride of being a soldier of the Great Awakening made Zhang Ming determined not to directly withdraw without even having the courage to fight.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ming was very decisive and directly unleashed the only [Concealing Heaven Talisman].</p><p></p><p>As the name suggests, the Concealing Heaven Talisman could conceal the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>It was well known that when a cultivator in the Profound Yellow Realm fell, there would be anomalies descending in the sky. The fallen cultivator's life, and even the specific manner of death, would be vividly displayed in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Under normal circumstances, it was fine, but if it was a life-and-death battle like today, any casualty on either side would instantly spread. It greatly increased the difficulty of combat.</p><p></p><p>However, with the [Concealing Heaven Talisman], the situation could be reversed and even turned into favorable combat conditions.</p><p></p><p>The Concealing Heaven Talisman could not only conceal the anomalies of cultivators' deaths but also accurately identify friend and foe and treat them differently.</p><p></p><p>If our side killed the enemy cultivators, no anomalies would occur. But if our cultivators were killed, anomalies would still descend and alert us.</p><p></p><p>Although the specific principle of how this talisman worked was unknown, there was no doubt that this single Concealing Heaven Talisman alone could turn the tide of victory.</p><p></p><p>"Relying on this talisman alone is not enough."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ming looked at a white jade arrow in his bosom.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, with our team's qualifications, we can only apply for one Annihilating Army Arrow each time we go out."</p><p></p><p>"If we could get more, let alone these Nascent Soul cultivators, I wouldn't be afraid even if they were Transformed Spirit."</p><p></p><p>The Annihilating Army Arrow was a weakened version of the Holy Dynasty's Patrolling Heaven Arrow.</p><p></p><p>Although it was weakened, it could still cause devastating damage to Nascent Soul realm cultivators and those below.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it had built-in tracking and aura locking functions. Once targeted, there was no chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>"With only this one arrow, it needs to be utilized to the fullest."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Zhang Ming had an idea in mind.</p><p></p><p>"Your subordinate is here!" A Golden Core middle-stage cultivator wearing earth-yellow clothes immediately responded to Zhang Ming's call.</p><p></p><p>"You use the [Rushing Flow Talisman] to transport these Kongming Flowing Crystals to the underground here." Zhang Ming marked the specific location on the map.</p><p></p><p>Fu Ge did not hesitate at all and collected the storage ring handed over by Zhang Ming.</p><p></p><p>With a flash of yellow light on his body, he disappeared from the ground.</p><p></p><p>The storage ring contained all the crystals Zhang Ming and the others had mined, which was only a small part of the giant ore vein here.</p><p></p><p>However, if it were to be detonated and specially guided, the diffused aura would be enough to attract the attention of the League of Ten Thousand Immortals cultivators on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Sick Three!"</p><p></p><p>"You set up formation arrays along the way to obstruct them. Remember, don't make it too easy for them, but also don't unleash those killing formations."</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged man with an earth-yellow complexion responded and left.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ming methodically completed the deployment of his own forces in a short time.</p><p></p><p>However, even though these few people all possessed unique skills, they still felt a bit stretched in the face of the absolute power gap.</p><p></p><p>The plan encountered an unexpected situation in the first step.</p><p></p><p>Those few League of Ten Thousand Immortals cultivators were not ordinary either. The person responsible for luring them to the ambush location was named Qiu Di.</p><p></p><p>In this small team, he was particularly outstanding in escape techniques.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, just after a brief encounter, before he could even use his escape technique, he was trapped by a white-clothed man among the League of Ten Thousand Immortals group who unleashed a Grotto-Heaven Dharma Domain.</p><p></p><p>This Grotto-Heaven Dharma Domain was quite peculiar. It did not manifest any specific appearance. It only projected a white light ring, suppressing Qiu Di.</p><p></p><p>Having tried various methods and seeing no hope of escape, Qiu Di resolutely...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He directly self-detonated, ending his own life.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the disappearance of the life force under his hands, Zhang Ming's heart twisted and his fists clenched tightly.</p><p></p><p>And these Wanxian Alliance cultivators obviously did not expect the other party to be so unyielding. Committing suicide at the slightest disagreement.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere suddenly became strange.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, Brother Lin Bai, something is wrong!" </p><p></p><p>After a while, some of them reacted.</p><p></p><p>"Is it fake death?"</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't seem like it. Indeed, the soul has been completely destroyed."</p><p></p><p>Lin Bai's expression turned solemn as he looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, his face turned ugly: "Be careful, someone has concealed the Heavenly Secrets."</p><p></p><p>Although he gave such a warning, the other few people were not afraid at all, but instead became extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"Concealing the Heavenly Secrets? Such an ordinary small world actually used such means. It seems there are secrets!"</p><p></p><p>"We ran to several places in vain. We finally have some gains."</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's not Kongming Flowing Crystal, if we can uncover the secrets of this place, perhaps this trip will not be in vain."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While everyone was discussing, they suddenly felt the earth tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a familiar aura came from underground.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned at first.</p><p></p><p>Then their faces were full of disbelief: "It's really Kongming Flowing Crystal?"</p><p></p><p>In their perception, in addition to the pervasive aura of flowing crystal, there seemed to be several figures quickly flying away from the source of the underground tremor.</p><p></p><p>"Seeing that it can no longer be concealed, they want to escape?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone subconsciously thought so.</p><p></p><p>Although they really wanted to go down and investigate, they were still somewhat on guard after all. They did not act rashly, but looked at Lin Bai in unison.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lin Bai quickly made a decision.</p><p></p><p>"Split into two groups. Brother Qian, you take three people to chase those fleeing cultivators. The rest follow me."</p><p></p><p>Without further ado, the Wanxian Alliance group quickly split into four people and chased towards the horizon.</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Bai, he led the team and rushed towards the place where the aura of Kongming Flowing Crystal came from underground.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, although there were some formations blocking the way.</p><p></p><p>They were easily broken through by them.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, many of the formations I have never seen before. Interesting..."</p><p></p><p>Everyone became more and more excited.</p><p></p><p>They quickly arrived at the destination.</p><p></p><p>A giant hole left after an explosion, where fragments of Kongming Flowing Crystal could still be vaguely seen.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! So ruthless, they actually destroyed it directly!"</p><p></p><p>"This is too wasteful! Now the price of a fist-sized flowing crystal has already risen to 50,000 contribution points! It's priceless!"</p><p></p><p>"There are still many fragments, quickly pick them up, we can't waste them!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Wanxian Alliance group was still somewhat organized.</p><p></p><p>However, after seeing the Kongming Flowing Crystal fragments all over the ground, their greed was aroused and they could no longer hold back.</p><p></p><p>They scrambled and flew into the hole one after another.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Bai was also a little greedy, he habitually observed the surroundings first.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to not have found any danger, only then did he also fly in.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, this place doesn't look like the original underground mineral vein of flowing crystals. Could it be a warehouse where they collected and stored them..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Bai picked up a small piece of flowing crystal, but this thought arose in his mind.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>A white jade arrow, unknowingly, silently shot from the dark underground towards the few people in the hole.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!" Lin Bai subconsciously shouted.</p><p></p><p>He fully activated his Dongtian Realm and set up hundreds of command flags to assist around his body.</p><p></p><p>However, the white jade arrow was even faster than expected.</p><p></p><p>A dazzling ball of light was born underground.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it devoured all the cultivators in the hole.</p><p></p><p>Along with their Dongtian, they completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, seeing the death of the Wanxian Alliance members, Zhang Ming's heart had no fluctuations at all.</p><p></p><p>Without delay, Zhang Ming hurried to his subordinates who acted as bait.</p><p></p><p>Compared to his side, their situation could be said to be extremely miserable.</p><p></p><p>Without a powerful weapon like the Annihilation Arrow, they could only rely on small tricks to block. They were quickly caught up by the Wanxian Alliance people.</p><p></p><p>They fell into a bitter battle.</p><p></p><p>By the time Zhang Ming led the crowd to arrive, there were only two people left desperately holding on.</p><p></p><p>That Wanxian Alliance cultivator surnamed Qian was still persuading: "Why bother, fellow Daoists? It's just something external, how can it compare to your own life? We also have no intention of taking your lives..."</p><p></p><p>Although he said so, the offensive on his hands did not weaken at all.</p><p></p><p>The armor on Zhang Ming's body burst out a crimson glow.</p><p></p><p>It turned into a red line and crashed straight towards the cultivator surnamed Qian.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qian be careful!"</p><p></p><p>After all, the difference in strength was too great. Even with the enhancement of the protective armor, it was not enough to make up for the gap between Golden Core and Nascent Soul.</p><p></p><p>He still dodged it.</p><p></p><p>The sneak attack failed, and instead he was heavily injured by the other party.</p><p></p><p>The light of the armor suddenly dimmed.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? What kind of protective magic treasure? After taking my full-strength attack, there is actually no crack at all?"</p><p></p><p>There was some surprise in the tone of the cultivator surnamed Qian, and also some greed mixed in.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that we are destined to die here."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ming thought so in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But he had no regrets.</p><p></p><p>He had delayed for so long, the reinforcements from the Holy Dynasty should arrive soon.</p><p></p><p>Before the giant Kongming Flowing Crystal mineral vein was discovered by the Wanxian Alliance, the Holy Dynasty would be able to reoccupy this place.</p><p></p><p>"After my death, my family should be proud of me."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe, I can even receive personal commendation from the Holy Emperor."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ming's heart was peaceful. Looking at the opposing Wanxian Alliance cultivators, he said in an icy tone: "Burn the soul!"</p><p></p><p>In the burning of the soul, the originally weakened aura suddenly erupted again.</p><p></p><p>"You guys are crazy?!" The Wanxian Alliance cultivators screamed in complete incomprehension.</p><p></p><p>For these people who were bound to die, they didn't bother to clash head-on with them.</p><p></p><p>Even though their strength was overwhelming, the Wanxian Alliance cultivators mainly focused on ensuring they were not injured and dodging.</p><p></p><p>The amplification effect brought by soul burning slowly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ming and the others finally reached the end of their lives.</p><p></p><p>Just before his consciousness was about to dissipate, Zhang Ming seemed to see a familiar figure.</p><p></p><p>"Little General Sun?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ming felt relieved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Boundless golden light enveloped him.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ming seemed to see the great faceless Holy Emperor on a vortex starry river.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang gathered the remaining thoughts of Zhang Ming and the others, and then looked at the Wanxian Alliance members.</p><p></p><p>Infinite killing intent instantly enveloped them.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, the few Wanxian Alliance members were buried along with the brave warriors of the Holy Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's gaze looked at the quiet sky, and his heart moved.</p><p></p><p>He pointed at the center of the sky.</p><p></p><p>The phenomenon of falling slowly appeared.</p><p></p><p>But it was completely fabricated falling information, contrary to the facts.</p>

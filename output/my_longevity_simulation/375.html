        <h1>Chapter 375</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Supported only by a few stone pillars.</p><p></p><p>The giant whale-like beast spewed out a burst of air, gently placing the Dust Ferry on an open platform.</p><p></p><p>Then it leaped into the river below.</p><p></p><p>An incredibly strange scene unfolded.</p><p></p><p>Such a huge beast leaped into the Qing River, yet not a single spray of water was splashed.</p><p></p><p>Just circles of ripples were stirred up, indicating that the whale had indeed leaped into the river and it wasn't a hallucination.</p><p></p><p>Dongfang led the others to leave the Dust Ferry, walked along the corridor, and headed towards a nearby group of buildings from the platform.</p><p></p><p>Walking on the river, the group felt somewhat jittery.</p><p></p><p>Afraid that the stone pillars below might collapse and they would fall into the river.</p><p></p><p>The green river water seemed to share the same origin as the Spirit Stone.</p><p></p><p>Countless river waters converged, and the suppression of spiritual energy reached its limit here, causing the power within Li Fan's body to completely quiet down.</p><p></p><p>Without the support of cultivation, Li Fan, nearing his limit, felt the effects of aging on himself more profoundly.</p><p></p><p>Even walking a few steps became a bit breathless.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the next second, he would be unable to hold on and fall.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the astonishment, Li Fan attempted to call upon his True Essence in his mind and found that he could still use it normally.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"This ghostly place can only be tolerated by people like you."</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's not the first time coming here, it's still hard to get used to."</p><p></p><p>After walking for a while, they finally arrived at a hall.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song wiped the sweat off his forehead and sighed. [\*content obscured\*]</p><p></p><p>"No way, the number of Soul Beads is limited. Building a large array is urgent and can't be delayed."</p><p></p><p>"Distribute them all to your subordinates and try to speed up the progress, there's no extra time."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, I could give one to Huangfu Brother to help in emergencies." Dongfang said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song waved his hand: "The mission is important, the mission is important."</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and finish the task, leaving this ghostly place is what matters."</p><p></p><p>Dongfang nodded, about to say something, but his face slightly changed.</p><p></p><p>A blue light suddenly flew in from outside and stopped directly in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked over and saw a small delicate blue bird.</p><p></p><p>Fluttering its wings and chirping, as if conveying something.</p><p></p><p>Dongfang seemed to understand this "bird language."</p><p></p><p>With the blue bird's chirping, he suddenly stood up, his expression becoming more serious.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, you can go now." Dongfang spoke.</p><p></p><p>The blue bird turned into a blue light and disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" Seeing Dongfang looking like he's facing a formidable enemy, Huangfu Song couldn't help but be curious and asked.</p><p></p><p>Dongfang arched his hand: "Huangfu brother, forgive me for not accompanying you."</p><p></p><p>"Received a sudden notification."</p><p></p><p>"The Chief is about to come for inspection, I need to make use of the time and inspect again. To avoid any oversight."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing that the leader's Chief is coming for inspection, Huangfu Song also became nervous.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, I understand."</p><p></p><p>"Official matters are important, Dongfang Brother, go and attend to your duties quickly."</p><p></p><p>"This rumored figure is really not so easy to deal with..."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu nodded, wanting to say something more, but suddenly froze in place.</p><p></p><p>The shock on his face could no longer be concealed as he turned abruptly towards Li Fan, who was sitting quietly on the side.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly indifferent to their conversation.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the reason he came here?"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible?!"</p><p></p><p>"A coincidence, or..."</p><p></p><p>After all, Huangfu Song is not an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he suppressed the abnormality on his face.</p><p></p><p>Dongfang, seemingly aware, glanced in the direction where Li Fan was.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't inquire further, bid farewell and left.</p><p></p><p>After Dongfang left, Huangfu Song could no longer contain himself and called out to Li Fan alone in an empty room.</p><p></p><p>Lowering his voice, he stared at Li Fan intently: "Kid, did you know in advance that Chief Lu would come?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan just smiled slightly, neither denying nor admitting.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Huangfu Song was already clear in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, as a member of the Tianyu State Formation Hall, Huangfu Song understood very well how high Chief Lu's position was.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention her own cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>Just her position as the Chief Formation Master of the Wanxian Alliance Formation Hall, and her authority over all formation affairs in the alliance, would easily crush Huangfu Song like an ant.</p><p></p><p>All the formation masters of the Wanxian Alliance Formation Hall are technically under her.</p><p></p><p>And this Chief Lu's methods are extremely ruthless.</p><p></p><p>The group of people who competed with her for the position of Chief in the past, shortly after she took office, all were suppressed for various reasons.</p><p></p><p>Disappeared from the world.</p><p></p><p>Such blatantly striking retaliatory actions not only did not cause any backlash but also gained strong support from the top decision-makers of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Then her series of decisive reform measures and several severe punishment methods.</p><p></p><p>It made the formation masters of the Formation Hall keep silent.</p><p></p><p>Various rumors about her kept surfacing in their minds.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song was sweating coldly on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Such a figure.</p><p></p><p>The seemingly unremarkable little guy in front of him, who looks like he has no foundation, actually knew her whereabouts several days in advance?</p><p></p><p>What does this mean?</p><p></p><p>Even if his background isn't Chief Lu herself.</p><p></p><p>He must be very close to Chief Lu.</p><p></p><p>…</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Huangfu Song couldn't help but feel dry in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder every time I see this kid, I feel like he's extraordinary, not an ordinary person."</p><p></p><p>"So he does have a backer, and such a strong one!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's past experiences rushed through Huangfu Song's mind, and he suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder he fought so desperately for the rankings, still full of indifference even close to death."</p><p></p><p>"It turns out he has a backing and is fearless."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder his selfless dedication has spread so quickly and widely within the Wanxian Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"It turns out he had planned it all in advance."</p><p></p><p>"Whatever selflessness for others, turns out it was a golden opportunity for him."</p><p></p><p>…</p><p></p><p>Several thoughts crossed his mind, cursing inwardly.</p><p></p><p>No matter how much he complained internally, Huangfu Song put on a brilliant smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Li Xia..."</p><p></p><p>"Uh, uh, Li Fan, my young friend, you really hide it well!"</p><p></p><p>"With such a relationship, why hide and pretend. You treat me like an outsider!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression remained the same: "Senior Huangfu, I don't know what you've guessed."</p><p></p><p>"But, it seems you misunderstood."</p><p></p><p>"Youngster, absolutely has no background."</p><p></p><p>He said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Still pretending, just pretending in front of me. Just afraid of a bad influence."</p><p></p><p>Thinking so in his mind, but Huangfu Song immediately nodded seriously: "I understand, I understand!"</p>

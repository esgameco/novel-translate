        <h1>Chapter 593</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Han Yi paced back and forth, muttering to himself. "Loss of one-third of the penalty, and my principal is ninety-one thousand."</p><p></p><p>"If I can successfully recover it, it will be sixty thousand..."</p><p></p><p>A pang of heartache struck Han Yi.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a look of inner conflict, he muttered, "Still missing over five hundred thousand!"</p><p></p><p>"If I push myself to rebound again within a year, I can earn this much."</p><p></p><p>"Just that, doing it so frequently might harm the foundation."</p><p></p><p>After a moment of inner conflict, Han Yi finally made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>"I used to think that as long as I could control the luck, I would definitely succeed in cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"However, based on my experiences in recent years, luck is not all-powerful. To achieve Dao, or even immortality, just relying on luck is far from enough."</p><p></p><p>"Resources, connections, they are equally important!"</p><p></p><p>"This opportunity to display my skills in the world is a once in a millennium chance. If I let it slip, it will be my loss!"</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Han Yi headed straight towards the Political Hall in Congyun City.</p><p></p><p>On his way there, he had already heard that a large group of cultivators had gathered here. Just like him, all of them were trying to redeem their contributions in advance.</p><p></p><p>Initially, he felt a bit relieved, thinking that with more people, things could be handled more smoothly.</p><p></p><p>But when he arrived, he felt a chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>There were only a few scattered people left here, looking frostbitten and despondent.</p><p></p><p>"Could there be some trouble again?" Anxious Han Yi quickly began to inquire.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, he had worried for nothing.</p><p></p><p>"As long as you are willing to compensate one-third of the penalty, you can retrieve your contributions?"</p><p></p><p>"No other additional conditions?"</p><p></p><p>Clarifying this, Han Yi couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator opposite him seemed somewhat displeased. "This is one-third, but you seem as if you don't care at all, fellow cultivator."</p><p></p><p>Han Yi shook his head. "I'm willing to accept the outcome. It was clearly stated in the contract. Since I signed it, even if I regret it, I won't say much about it."</p><p></p><p>"I originally thought that the Lord would take advantage of everyone's urgent need for money to add more conditions."</p><p></p><p>"But now it seems that their credibility is not bad."</p><p></p><p>Unintentional words might lead to intentional interpretations.</p><p></p><p>However, Han Yi's words angered some cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"You, could you be a follower brought by Li Fan? Your tone makes it sound like you've been swindled by him a lot and still want to thank him?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, this fellow cultivator seems suspicious. He looks like someone brought here by Li Fan to sow discord. Let's not be misled by his deceptive words!"</p><p></p><p>"Truly despicable!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Han Yi inexplicably became the target of everyone's venting.</p><p></p><p>For a while, he hadn't come to his senses and felt bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, He Zhenghao saw this and intervened in time.</p><p></p><p>"Why create a scene for no reason! I find what this fellow cultivator is saying very reasonable, willing to accept the outcome! The agreement was not forced upon you by our Lord. Some of you even sought my help in fundraising? How come now, one by one, you are turning your backs on it?" He Zhenghao criticized fiercely, with a powerful momentum.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other cultivators no longer dared to argue with him face to face and had to leave dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>"How should I address you, fellow cultivator?" As the crowd dispersed, He Zhenghao looked at the only cultivator who spoke in defense of Li Fan, asking in a friendly tone.</p><p></p><p>"I am Han Yi!" Han Yi knew that this man was He Zhenghao, the one in charge of the fundraising project and also the crucial figure for him to retrieve his contributions, making him nervous for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, fellow cultivator Han, relax. The number of cultivators I have interacted with, let alone more than ten thousand."</p><p></p><p>Naturally, he instantly saw through Han Yi's current state of mind.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the sudden order from Li Fan earlier, he had an idea in mind.</p><p></p><p>"In this era, there are not many cultivators as principled as fellow cultivator Han." He Zhenghao shook his head with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be deceived by the rumors and gossip outside. Our Lord is definitely not a fraudster. On the contrary, he is kind-hearted. Knowing that many cultivators urgently need contributions, he specifically instructed me."</p><p></p><p>"If you encounter real difficulties, the penalty can be waived."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Han Yi was pleasantly surprised. "Really?"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's expression turned solemn. "Our Lord always does what he says. How could it be false?"</p><p></p><p>"Come, fellow cultivator Han, I will now handle the relevant matters for you."</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, Han Yi looked at the ninety-one thousand contributions he had lost and recovered, feeling a myriad of emotions in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that my luck has turned?"</p><p></p><p>Upon further thought, Han Yi vaguely felt that his calamity had not yet passed.</p><p></p><p>"No, it should be said that Li Fan indeed lives up to his reputation. His magnanimity is extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>"With so many contributions in breach, he simply waved his hand and waived them."</p><p></p><p>"I see those cultivators just now, clearly suspecting the lord, are obviously small-minded. They have misjudged the benevolence of the lord!"</p><p></p><p>While feeling grateful to Li Fan in secret, Han Yi couldn't help but think this way.</p><p></p><p>However, he was unaware that this way of thinking was precisely what Li Fan wanted.</p><p></p><p>He conveyed orders through Zhou Qingang.</p><p></p><p>When defaulting cultivators came to him, he could selectively waive half of the penalties needed to extract the contributions.</p><p></p><p>In this way, although he earned less, it could still stir things up.</p><p></p><p>The forgiven cultivators, seeing others denigrate Li Fan while being beneficiaries themselves, naturally would speak up in his defense.</p><p></p><p>However, the losses of others were real.</p><p></p><p>Certainly, they couldn't be easily swayed.</p><p></p><p>As a result, disputes were inevitable.</p><p></p><p>When the public opinion was divided, and blame and criticism went both ways, onlookers who were indifferent to the matter would not easily believe either side's viewpoint.</p><p></p><p>This way, negative influences could be invisibly mitigated as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>When others inquired, they could simply say, "Oh, this matter is a bit complicated, and the arguments cannot be easily settled."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's actions were actually a strategic move.</p><p></p><p>To appease the cultivators who were still undecided and had not retrieved their contributions.</p><p></p><p>If he acted too recklessly, some would inevitably become suspicious, thinking he was indeed planning to run away.</p><p></p><p>But once their doubts were temporarily suppressed, all they needed to do was wait for the arrival of the catastrophic event, to bring the narrative of this world in the Congyun Sea to its conclusion.</p><p></p><p>It was almost as Li Fan had foreseen.</p><p></p><p>Despite causing quite a stir, ultimately, this matter gradually faded from people's memories.</p><p></p><p>As the deadline for discounted cultivation methods approached day by day, cultivators continued to focus the majority of their efforts on earning contributions, exchanging for the cultivation methods before the opportunity disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi was no different.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because everyone lacked contributions, he had been searching for a suitable opportunity for a long time but had not found one.</p><p></p><p>In desperation, he activated the Heavenly Luck Scripture to search for opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Following the resonance, he left the Congyun Sea and headed inland towards the Wanxian Alliance.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1163: Three Words Shock the Immortal</p><p></p><p>Li Ping seemed to have seen through Baihua's concerns and said solemnly, "The Five Elders Conference of the Wanxian Alliance is indeed powerful, but those in the Xuanhuang Realm who are dissatisfied with their rule are not limited to us."</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention the forces, big and small, hidden in various minor worlds, there are countless people within the Wanxian Alliance harboring ulterior motives."</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, a vast network of interpersonal relationships suddenly unfolded slowly before Baihua Daoren.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren looked intently and saw that the faces were none other than members of various organizations within the Wanxian Alliance!</p><p></p><p>Not only their names and appearances, but also their life stories, personalities, the possibility of being recruited, predictions of future behavior development and other information were listed in great detail, leaving nothing out.</p><p></p><p>And those specially marked out were the unstable elements within the Wanxian Alliance, people who were easy to win over.</p><p></p><p>Looking at these words and pictures, in Baihua Daoren's mind, the Wanxian Alliance was no longer just three empty words, but instantly took on a vivid image.</p><p></p><p>The more Baihua Daoren looked, the more shocked she became, "No wonder this person dares to make such a bold statement, confident in contending with the Wanxian Alliance. Such detailed information must have taken who knows how long to collect. It's not just a matter of time, some secrets can't be obtained without high-level internal support."</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren did not believe that everything in front of her was fabricated by the other party. The information was too detailed, with a low possibility of being forged.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to take a closer look, but saw Li Ping wave his hand and the light screen in front changed again.</p><p></p><p>This time, it changed from information about the Wanxian Alliance to information about various small worlds in the Xuanhuang Realm. Those with formidable strength that could be cooperated with, those not strong but resource-rich that could be conquered and used as production bases. There were even extremely dangerous ones that were not recommended to be in contact with...</p><p></p><p>A hidden scroll of the Xuanhuang Realm slowly unfolded before Baihua Daoren.</p><p></p><p>While Baihua Daoren was shocked, she also felt a sense of helplessness. Being forced to see so many secrets of the Holy Dynasty, she probably had no choice but to join now.</p><p></p><p>As for tearing off the facade and engaging in a big fight with the other party...</p><p></p><p>Even though Baihua Daoren was an immortal-level existence in her original world, at this moment, facing this Faceless Holy Emperor, she did not have complete confidence in winning. Moreover, whenever the thought of being hostile to him arose, an instinctive premonition of irreversible doom would vaguely well up.</p><p></p><p>This had never happened before. Even when she was captured by the Fishing Pool back then, she had never experienced such a sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>So, when Li Ping very calmly extended an invitation for her to join the Holy Dynasty, Baihua Daoren agreed without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping laughed loudly, "Good, good, good. With Daoist Baihua's help, our chances of winning are greater."</p><p></p><p>"There is one thing that still requires Daoist's assistance." It turned out that as soon as Baihua joined, Li Ping couldn't wait to arrange a task for her.</p><p></p><p>The map projection in front suddenly shrank, eventually focusing on one of the five interlocking minor worlds.</p><p></p><p>"This Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven, I want to set it as the final prize for this fishing competition. But it is currently located within the Wanxian Alliance's Tianling Prefecture. At the border junction, it is easy to attract the attention of the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders Conference. So..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's tone was quite sincere, "I'll have to trouble Daoist to move it to the surrounding void near my Great Qi."</p><p></p><p>At first, Baihua Daoren only thought it was an ordinary grotto-heaven and didn't pay much attention. But when Li Ping transmitted the specific information about the Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Baihua Jingang's body suddenly shook uncontrollably. </p><p></p><p>These five interconnected heavenly caves were simply too large! With her strength, she could indeed barely move them over. But afterwards, she would definitely be severely exhausted.</p><p></p><p>Would the other party take advantage of her exhaustion to plot against her?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Ping smiled and said, "It's just that I really can't get away, so I have no choice but to trouble you."</p><p></p><p>"If I really wanted to deal with you, I'm afraid I wouldn't need any schemes or tricks at all..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's tone did not fluctuate in the slightest, as if he was just stating a simple fact.</p><p></p><p>Along with Li Ping's words, several stone puppets appeared silently in the void, vaguely surrounding Baihua Daoren in the center.</p><p></p><p>A flash of light illuminated Baihua's mind, and she instantly found the source of this familiar feeling from her memory. It turned out to be the terrifying disasters that had rampaged and annihilated countless immortal worlds long ago!</p><p></p><p>"Are you crazy?!" Baihua Daoren couldn't help but scream. Her body instinctively quickly distanced itself from these stone puppets.</p><p></p><p>"You're playing with fire! The power of world-destroying disasters, how can we control it? If we're not careful, I'm afraid even the Xuanhuang Realm, our last refuge, will be destroyed by you!" Baihua Daoren's body trembled, both shocked and angry.</p><p></p><p>She never thought that this so-called like-minded person would turn out to be a complete madman. No wonder she had felt an indescribable sense of crisis from him before...</p><p></p><p>Faced with Baihua Daoren's accusations, Li Ping was not concerned.</p><p></p><p>He snorted coldly and said, "The world-destroying calamities have only temporarily disappeared. Who can guarantee that they will not reappear in the future? Even if we are lucky enough to escape from the immortal ruins, what will we do when we encounter other disasters in the future?"</p><p></p><p>"Constantly avoiding them will ultimately lead to inevitable doom. Only by actively researching and mastering their power can we win true freedom!" Li Ping's tone was extremely resolute, and even had a hint of fanaticism.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand again, and three extremely complex yet sacred twisted symbols appeared beside him.</p><p></p><p>They revolved around Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Without any power contained within them, just the shapes they depicted alone made the Eternal Life Realm Baihua Daoren tremble.</p><p></p><p>And Li Ping, who was surrounded by the three mysterious symbols, had an even more sacred and devilishly charming aura about him.</p><p></p><p>Making people not dare to look directly at him.</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, these three True Immortal Seal Characters were painstakingly collected by me from the void. Don't you want to take a look, Daoyou?" Li Ping's voice rumbled, echoing through this dark space.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren noticed that the young servant Liuli was showing signs of waking up, and hurriedly cast a spell to make her fall asleep again. </p><p></p><p>As for herself, she really didn't dare to look directly at those three True Immortal Seal Characters!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the True Immortal Seal Characters contained boundless power. But was that transcendent power really something that cultivators like them who had not yet reached the immortal path could control?</p><p></p><p>She had personally witnessed countless cultivators, including Eternal Life Realm existences like herself, being annihilated under this power without any ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>In her view, studying the True Immortal Seal Characters was like a child wielding a world-destroying weapon.</p><p></p><p>If anything went wrong, not only would one instantly face life and death, but even the entire world would be dragged down to be buried along with them!</p><p></p><p>She clearly still had many years to live, so how could she engage in such extreme actions!</p><p></p><p>That's all for today. The two images today were taken with my phone camera while I was out.</p>

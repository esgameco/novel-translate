        <h1>Chapter 1323</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1312: The Force of True Immortals Attracts Enemies</p><p></p><p>The Formation Lives Up to Its Name</p><p></p><p>The Heaven's Edge Formation could turn the distance between heaven's edge and within an arm's reach. After the great formation was completed, it would connect the Xuanhuang Realm and the edge of the Starry Sea. Even without using the sword technique to travel through the void, one could instantly come and go through this great formation. </p><p></p><p>It seemed to be a teleportation formation, but it was not.</p><p></p><p>Within the Darkest Starry Sea, the remnant forces of True Immortals lingered. The Xuanhuang Realm was located at the edge of the Immortal Ruins, influenced by the endless absorbing force, causing space-time to subtly distort. The distance was too far, with too many uncontrollable factors, making teleportation impossible.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven's Edge Formation used the most primitive method of travel - infinitely shortening the distance between the starting point and destination, allowing one to arrive with just a step.</p><p></p><p>The entire Small World of Daxuan could not accommodate this massive immortal formation. Therefore, on the Xuanhuang side, Li Fan set up the formation in the void outside the Small World of Daxuan and covered it with an array to conceal it.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan gradually completed the formation on the edge of the Starry Sea, an extremely profound fluctuation suddenly descended, about to sweep outwards.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan pinched his fingers, using the surrounding concealing arrays to block it.</p><p></p><p>The golden light of the great formation dimmed, and a two-way passage between Xuanhuang and the edge of the Starry Sea was quietly born.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood in midair, adjusting his breath to recover.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of an immortal-level formation, even with the aid of the Terminal Separation Disk, setting it up was quite taxing." The accumulated source essence was completely depleted, leaving Li Fan temporarily in a state of depletion.</p><p></p><p>"Source essence still has a qualitative gap compared to the true spiritual power of immortals," Li Fan mused inwardly. After a few breaths, the power within him became full again.</p><p></p><p>He sent a strand of divine sense into the Heaven's Edge Formation and activated the array.</p><p></p><p>His vision blurred for a moment, and in the next instant, he had returned to the void outside Daxuan in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then slowly returned his sword's illusory shadow.</p><p></p><p>"I have set up a teleportation array here, so traveling back and forth will not be so troublesome in the future," Li Fan said lightly.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Yin Shengren and the others were shaken to their souls. With their level of understanding, they naturally knew just how extraordinary this formation spanning the entire Starry Sea was.</p><p></p><p>The long-distance teleportation formations between states within the Xuanhuang Realm often required more than ten formation masters working diligently for half a year to complete. Not to mention this grand formation connecting the edge of the Starry Sea to the Xuanhuang Realm. Yet such a formation was completed by the Saint Master with casual ease...</p><p></p><p>At first, the four of them were somewhat doubtful.</p><p></p><p>However, after Li Fan invited them to try it out and they passed through the formation, feeling the familiar aura of the Small World of Daxuan again, all their doubts were dispelled, replaced by shock and reverence for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"With just one formation, the boundless Starry Sea becomes a passageway. The Saint Master's skills are simply comparable to True Immortals," Qiao Gong sighed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>"This formation, this formation..." Yin Shengren murmured in shock.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's voice pulled them back: "From now on, this will be our transit resupply station for exploration."</p><p></p><p>"Whether it is the Sea of Relics or the Remnant Wall, their vastness far exceeds the Xuanhuang Realm. Finding a suitable remnant realm is no easy task."</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong: "Please enlighten us, Saint Master, what is the profound meaning behind this? Don't we just need to find a remnant realm to act as the catalyst for Xuanhuang's consumption?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled faintly and stretched out his hand towards the distant Sea of Relics.</p><p></p><p>A relic, a tattered blue and white robe stained with blackened bloodstains, was attracted and flew rapidly towards them.</p><p></p><p>In their perception, the distance between themselves and their companions around them was rapidly increasing as the relic robe approached. It was as if the world had suddenly expanded, while their bodies had shrunk countless times. Even their communication became faint and inaudible to each other.</p><p></p><p>"The force of True Immortals!" They finally realized that this effect was caused by the True Immortal power carried by the relic robe.</p><p></p><p>As the robe drew closer, the gap between them continued to widen.</p><p></p><p>Though standing right next to each other, they could no longer see one another.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they were isolated from the entire world.</p><p></p><p>In the boundless emptiness, Li Fan's voice thundered from above.</p><p></p><p>"In the Darkest Starry Sea, the realms have been destroyed. But the root cause that led to the destruction of the worlds, the power of the True Immortal Sigils, still lingers."</p><p></p><p>"The various calamities we encountered on our way to the heart of the Starry Sea were all manifestations of this remnant True Immortal force."</p><p></p><p>"The relics and remnant realms stretching endlessly before us also contain this force."</p><p></p><p>"The robe contains the Sigil of 'Separation'."</p><p></p><p>Their vision suddenly returned to normal, and the relic robe changed direction, flying back into the Sea of Relics.</p><p></p><p>Above their heads, an intricate and profound "Sigil" flickered in and out of view.</p><p></p><p>"True Immortal...Sigils?"</p><p></p><p>They gazed dazedly at the Sigil overhead, able to vaguely sense the terrifying power contained within.</p><p></p><p>"Separation..." Recalling the experience of being separated from everything around them and the heavens and earth, they tried to mimic and study the Sigil with their hands as pens.</p><p></p><p>But the Sigil suddenly dimmed and dissipated into the void.</p><p></p><p>Even the memory of it in their minds became blurred and unclear. No matter how hard they tried to recall it, they could not reproduce it.</p><p></p><p>"There are too many remnants of True Immortal forces in the Starry Sea. Recklessly disturbing them may cause these remnants to resonate. To study the True Immortal Sigils requires special countermeasures." Li Fan waved his finger, and a technique flew into their minds.</p><p></p><p>It was the method Li Fan learned from the Xuan Xian Boat in his previous life, used by the Evidence Dao Academy, Xuan Shu Institute, and Duan Xian Building to research, teach, and pass down the True Immortal Sigils.</p><p></p><p>The Sigil Imitation Methods.</p><p></p><p>Each True Immortal Sigil was a projection of the power of the Dao. Even an approximation that was not a true Immortal Sigil contained immense destructive power. If unleashed within the Xuan Xian Boat, it would undoubtedly cause irreparable damage. To study the Sigils without triggering their power, generations of the Xuan Xian Boat painstakingly created these methods.</p><p></p><p>Every stroke, even the process of writing each stroke, was specially modified to be similar yet different - not quite a dot, not quite a horizontal line, not quite a firm stroke. Combined, it looked like the Sigil but was not.</p><p></p><p>It was like the crudest imitation. The True Immortal Sigils produced using this method had the form but lacked the essence, unable to unleash the terrifying power within.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The power of the celestial seal characters was reduced by millions of times. </p><p></p><p>However, to truly unleash the power of the true celestial seal characters, one only needs to remove all modifications when activating them.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this wondrous method that the celestial ark was able to pass down the study of the true celestial seal characters generation after generation, up and down.</p><p></p><p>Within the celestial ark, only those who became disciples of the ruling elders were qualified to learn this method.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan had freely taught this wondrous method to Yuan Shengren and others without any conditions.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the various methods or the "Li" character, they all greatly shocked these few.</p><p></p><p>If everything Li Fan had taught before was still within the mortal realm, then this "Li" character was undoubtedly true celestial power.</p><p></p><p>In the current cultivation world, to master such mighty power yet not jealously guard it for oneself, but teach others for free...</p><p></p><p>No matter what guesses Yuan Shengren and the others had about Li Fan's motives, they were all moved by his selfless demeanor at this moment. </p><p></p><p>"Worthy of being called a sage," they unanimously sighed in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's lecture continued. </p><p></p><p>Using the various methods again to write the "Li" character, Li Fan candidly said: "I have never seen the original 'Li' character. I only inferred the origin of the true celestial seal characters based on the residual power contained in the relics."</p><p></p><p>"Like a blind man feeling an elephant, there is naturally some deviation. The smaller the deviation, the closer it can recreate the original power of the true celestial seal characters. This 'Li' character has reached a 98% similarity to the original. However, I haven't been able to make any further progress for a long time." Li Fan sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>Everyone stared hungrily at the character Li Fan had written, not looking down on it just because it was a similar form.</p><p></p><p>As they were studying it intently, faint strange fluctuations transmitted from the distance.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Shengren and the others did not sense it, but a sharp light flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's finally here."</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his big hand, he concealed the sword shadow and the Horizon Realm Formation, but rushed quickly towards the direction of the fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>Soon, two figures collided head-on.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan saw that the approaching figure was Zhong Daogang, the great elder of the Celestial Abode!</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogang had a solemn expression and looked at Li Fan with a hint of doubt in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Earlier on the celestial ark, he had sensed a familiar burst of power fluctuations around him that suddenly erupted and then disappeared, so he came to investigate.</p><p></p><p>It had been many years since he last saw a cultivator from outside the celestial ark.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogang did not dare to be careless: "May I ask, fellow Daoist, why you have summoned me here..."</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan just chuckled: "This fellow Daoist must have misunderstood something. I was just teaching my disciples the true celestial seal characters, I didn't expect it would catch your attention."</p><p></p><p>"I never imagined there were still surviving cultivators in this remote corner of the star sea!" Li Fan's tone was full of pleasant surprise and curiosity.</p><p></p><p>When Zhong Daogang heard this, his eyes narrowed as he scrutinized Li Fan carefully.</p><p></p><p>He was keenly aware of the words "remote corner of the star sea" in Li Fan's speech. At the same time, Li Fan's mention of teaching the true celestial seal characters also shook his heart.</p><p></p><p>Without confirming Li Fan's intentions, Zhong Daogang did not take action directly, but continued questioning: "From your words, fellow Daoist, it seems you came from the depths of the star sea? Could it be that there is still a surviving civilization within the Darkest Star Sea?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed: "On the journey here, it was nothing but emptiness. I had thought there were no other survivors left in the star sea. But unexpectedly, at the end of the road, I encountered a cultivator..."</p><p></p><p>The two probed each other through this exchange of words.</p><p></p><p>After this confrontation, Zhong Daogang only knew that the other party was from the depths of the star sea, but was unclear about the form, scale and strength of the world he came from.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that this cultivator capable of traversing the star sea was no pure, naive person.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogang carefully studied Li Fan again.</p><p></p><p>Unable to discern the other's background, Zhong Daogang suppressed his intention to directly capture Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Just now, fellow Daoist mentioned teaching disciples the true celestial seal characters. I wonder..." Zhong Daogang changed the subject to continue probing.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Li Fan did not hide anything this time and said openly: "With the civilization of the star sea destroyed and the residual power of the true immortals running rampant, naturally one must rely on these powers to survive."</p><p></p><p>"After thousands of years of research, I have made some small gains. Survival is no longer as difficult as it was initially."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's words aligned perfectly with the principles of the Celestial Ark. Zhong Daogang nodded without refuting him.</p><p></p><p>"It seems your homeland has reached quite an admirable level in researching the true celestial seal characters. To be honest, we have also spent thousands of years pondering the power of the true immortals. Yet we dare not easily traverse the star sea like you, fellow Daoist. We have only been cowering in a corner," Zhong Daogang said.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly: "There is no need for the fellow Daoist to be so modest. I can sense the..."</p><p></p><p>"Aura of the true celestial seal characters on you," Li Fan said meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogang's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Before Zhong Daogang could speak, Li Fan directly used his hand as a pen and wrote the "Li" character in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Please take a look at this character, fellow Daoist."</p><p></p><p>The faintly visible character floated in the void.</p><p></p><p>"Just who is this fellow Daoist? Why does he know our Celestial Ark's various methods..."</p><p></p><p>"Various methods?" Li Fan looked puzzled for a moment, then seemed to realize something.</p><p></p><p>"You mean the Analogy Methods?"</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, these are the methods painstakingly researched by our predecessors to analyze the true celestial seal characters."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at Zhong Daogang with great interest: "Could it be that the fellow Daoist also knows these methods?"</p><p></p><p>Not just know them. Zhong Daogang's expression became inscrutable.</p><p></p><p>His mind raced, trying to recall if anyone from the celestial ark had transmitted these methods outside.</p><p></p><p>There was no record of anyone leaving the celestial ark.</p><p></p><p>"Could it really just be a coincidence?" Zhong Daogang began to doubt.</p><p></p><p>He stared at the "Li" character Li Fan had written.</p><p></p><p>"It's even more advanced than the celestial ark's research?!"</p><p></p><p>After making this discovery, Zhong Daogang was once again overwhelmed by shock.</p><p></p><p>Not only because the other party's research on the "Li" true celestial seal character surpassed that of the celestial ark.</p><p></p><p>But also because the other party so easily revealed the precious true celestial seal character to a stranger.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that within the celestial ark, every single true celestial seal character was an absolute secret.</p><p></p><p>Even as the great elder of the Celestial Abode, he did not have the authority to casually divulge them.</p><p></p><p>"This can only mean that in this person's homeland, the research on the true celestial seal characters has reached a certain level of mastery. The 'Li' character no longer needs to be kept secret," Zhong Daogang could not help but think.</p><p></p><p>A thought arose in Zhong Daogang's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, would you be interested in visiting as a guest?" Zhong Daogang asked.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan immediately showed a look of hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daogang understood Li Fan's hesitation very well, so he said candidly: "If you are not at ease, we can stay in the void of this star sea."</p>

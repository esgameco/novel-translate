        <h1>Chapter 735</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jishi Wen took out a golden flag and threw it to the ground. In an instant, a formation appeared beneath their feet.</p><p></p><p>Chu Zongyi's expression became excited, while Li Fan's remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>The light of the formation flashed, and the three of them transformed into streams of light, shooting up like shooting stars from the market directly to the Spiritual Stone City in the sky.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, the three of them had set foot on the ground made of spiritual stones.</p><p></p><p>"Woo woo..." The concentration of spiritual energy in the sky city was shockingly high, frantically pouring into their bodies and causing a blockage in the flow of their spiritual energy. Chu Zongyi's face turned purple, just like an ordinary person whose throat was blocked and couldn't breathe.</p><p></p><p>It was Li Fan who suddenly patted his back and saved him.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough..." The recovered Chu Zongyi still greedily absorbed the pure spiritual energy around him, his face filled with amazement. Jishi Wen, who was leading the way, flashed a hint of pride in his eyes. But after seeing Li Fan's unchanged expression, his face immediately darkened.</p><p></p><p>After passing through the Spiritual Stone City, Li Fan finally saw the Jie family's ancestor in a central garden.</p><p></p><p>Contrary to the expected aged appearance, Jie Wangxian was actually a young man in his twenties, with shoulder-length hair, a handsome appearance, and stars twinkling in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Jishi Wen's respectful greeting of "Greetings, Ancestor," Li Fan and Chu Zongyi would have had a hard time believing that this "young cultivator" was the real one.</p><p></p><p>"So you are the ones who wish to see me?" Jie Wangxian asked softly.</p><p></p><p>Even without any deliberate pressure, the aura he inadvertently exuded still made Li Fan and Chu Zongyi feel a tightness in their chests.</p><p></p><p>Chu Zongyi nodded repeatedly, about to explain the matter. But he was still stopped by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Looking at his own biological father, Li Fan calmly said, "The matter is better kept secret. With this person here, it's not good to speak of it."</p><p></p><p>Jishi Wen was enraged: "You bastard..."</p><p></p><p>But before he could fully unleash his anger, he was interrupted by Jie Wangxian's raised hand.</p><p></p><p>Jie Wangxian chuckled lightly: "You little brat, you are quite interesting. Shimen, you may leave now."</p><p></p><p>Obeying the ancestor's command, Jishi Wen had no choice but to leave, his eyes filled with a hatred that wished to tear Li Fan to pieces.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, now you can speak," Jie Wangxian said, his smile fading.</p><p></p><p>Chu Zongyi's heart trembled, and he hastily explained the Tian Jian Sect's need for a large amount of Taiyuan Jing Jin to forge a divine weapon that could split the world, and that whoever could solve this problem would have a chance to become the next sect master.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Jie, with your Tianxia Merchant Guild's strong strength, if you participate, the position of sect master will be almost assured. After we leave Tian Jian Mountain, the vast lands within a radius of nine thousand miles will all belong to you..." Chu Zong persuaded earnestly.</p><p></p><p>However, Jie Wangxian was different from what Chu Zongyi had imagined, and he remained completely indifferent.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he sighed, "Everyone knows that the position of Tian Jian Sect Master is just an empty title. The real power holder is the 'Elder Brother' Situ Yao."</p><p></p><p>"The Taiyuan Jing Jin is rare in the world and of great value. To forge a divine weapon..."</p><p></p><p>"Even with our Tianxia Merchant Guild's financial strength, it would require a huge investment. And in the end, it would only be an empty title..."</p><p></p><p>Jie Wangxian suddenly looked at Li Fan: "Your name is Jie Zhaoxuan, right? Since you left home, it seems..."</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This is the first time returning home. After traveling such a long distance, do you think this plan is feasible?" </p><p>Chu Zongyi was suddenly taken aback: "Brother Ji..."</p><p>Li Fan then said, "But we can give it a try."</p><p>Ji Wangxian's eyes suddenly gleamed with a hint of brilliance, and he laughed heartily, "Good, you have a bit of my old self."</p><p>"You're right! The uncertainty of this matter is too high, and the risk-reward ratio is not proportional. The Tianjian Sect can just pat their butts and leave whenever they want. We won't even be able to find the creditors."</p><p>"But, we can indeed give it a try!"</p><p>"The foundation of the Ten Immortal Sects. If our Tianxia Merchant Guild can swallow it up..." Ji Wangxian stood with his hands behind his back, turning his head to gaze into the distance, his tone indescribable.</p><p>In an instant, the situation took an unexpected turn.</p><p>Chu Zongyi heard this and was overjoyed.</p><p>With the approval of the Patriarch, the subsequent events went smoother than Li Fan had expected.</p><p>In Ji Shiwen's disbelieving gaze, Li Fan and Chu Zongyi returned with three thousand catties of Taiyuan Refined Gold from the Tianxia Merchant Guild's reserves.</p><p>Moreover, Ji Wangxian stated that the Tianxia Merchant Guild would fully support "Ji Zhaoxuan" in his bid to become the Sect Master of the Tianjian Sect.</p><p>It was surprisingly generous, and he did not demand any promises from Li Fan.</p><p>If Li Fan didn't know about the body he possessed, which had once lost control and acted on its own, he would have been moved by this unconditional trust.</p><p>"It seems the Ji family is quite confident in their ability to control the spies they've dispatched to the various sects," Li Fan thought with a cold smile, while also pondering ways to break through this.</p><p>Back at the Tianjian Sect, Li Fan handed over the three thousand catties of Taiyuan Refined Gold and stated that more would continue to arrive.</p><p>This immediately caused an uproar throughout the entire sect.</p><p>After all, the disciples had only managed to gather a little over a thousand catties, including the sect's original reserves.</p><p>Li Fan, on his own, had obtained more than three times that amount.</p><p>After also presenting the few jars of fine wine he had brought back from the Ji Mansion to Sifu Tiao, the Tianjian Sect's Elder Brother was overjoyed and praised Li Fan as a model disciple of the Tianjian Sect.</p><p>With Chu Zongyi's promotion, Li Fan's background with the Tianxia Merchant Guild also gradually spread.</p><p>Suddenly, there was a constant stream of senior brothers coming to visit Li Fan's residence, seeking to establish connections with him.</p><p>Most of the Tianjian Sect cultivators believed that Li Fan was a strong contender to become the next Sect Master.</p><p>And as more Taiyuan Refined Gold continued to arrive from the Tianxia Merchant Guild, the people's confidence in this judgment only grew stronger.</p><p>At this critical juncture, Li Fan quietly visited the current Tianjian Sect Master, Huo Yuzhu.</p><p>"Oh? Isn't this the pillar of our Tianjian Sect, the designated successor to the Sect Master position? What brings you here?" Huo Yuzhu smiled, but a hint of mockery flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Li Fan remained calm and straightforward, "I'm here for the Sect Master position."</p><p>Huo Yuzhu's expression changed: "Young man, don't think that just because..."</p><p>"Sect Master Huo, don't you hope to hand over your position to someone else? Even if it's just a nominal role, the power of the Sect Master still intoxicates people, doesn't it?"</p><p>Sensing the underlying meaning in Li Fan's words, Huo Yuzhu's face became unsettled: "What exactly do you mean?"</p><p>"I know of a place with a large amount of Taiyuan Refined Gold, far more than what the Ji family can gather." Li Fan spoke in a low voice.</p><p>Huo Yuzhu was somewhat surprised as he scrutinized Li Fan, not understanding his intentions.</p><p>"I wish to exchange the position of Tianjian Sect Master for complete freedom. Sect Master, would you be willing to help me with this?" Li Fan asked with a smile.</p>

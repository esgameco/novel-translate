        <h1>Chapter 507</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Just the content in the book seems a bit different."</p><p></p><p>Scene after scene from the book flashed through his mind, and Li Fan suddenly felt a familiar but uncertain feeling, furrowing his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Excuse me, fellow daoist, is there any other version of this book?" He looked at the cultivator who was focused on watching the aerial duel scene at the stall and asked.</p><p></p><p>The book peddler was a bit impatient initially, but when he turned around and saw the album Li Fan was holding, a hint of a strange expression flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow daoist is joking, this 'Ancient Cultivation Secret History' is personally written by Lord Tianzun, how could there be other versions?" He denied without thinking.</p><p></p><p>Although only a strand of divine sense stripped of most memories was controlling his body, his ability to observe words and expressions was already innate.</p><p></p><p>With just one glance, Li Fan confirmed his guess.</p><p></p><p>"Let's discuss the price." He lowered his voice and said directly, "Introduced by a mutual acquaintance."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the book peddler couldn't help but hesitate.</p><p></p><p>After looking around for a moment and realizing that all the attention of the city's cultivators was focused on the battle in the sky, he transmitted, "Ten thousand soul points, or an equivalent value of spirit stones will do. No second price."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan subconsciously touched his storage ring, about to pay.</p><p></p><p>But he found himself penniless, not even having a storage ring.</p><p></p><p>"Please wait a moment, fellow daoist."</p><p></p><p>He apologized and then returned to the crowd.</p><p></p><p>After Lü Fan finished his battle, Li Fan approached him and explained the situation.</p><p></p><p>Lü Fan, who had just achieved another victory, was quite spirited, showing no signs of being calculative as he did during their previous transaction.</p><p></p><p>He handed a storage ring filled with standard spirit stones to Li Fan openly, saying, "Just material possessions, fellow daoist Jiao, please take it!"</p><p></p><p>After thanking him, Li Fan floated back under the scrutiny of onlookers.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the book peddler realized he had been deceived. His face turned slightly green, and he quickly packed up to leave.</p><p></p><p>"You have no integrity as a businessman. If you really just leave like this, I will have to call out!" Li Fan threatened through voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>The book peddler immediately stopped, looked around, and trembled.</p><p></p><p>"Really..." After much hesitation, he took out a album emitting a pink light and discreetly handed it over.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took the album and handed over the spirit stones casually.</p><p></p><p>As the trade was completed, the book peddler was about to leave, but he saw that Li Fan intended to open the album right there.</p><p></p><p>His face paled, and he hurried forward, pressing Li Fan's hands.</p><p></p><p>"Are you out of your mind?"</p><p></p><p>His body trembled, a look of fear on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry!" He gently pushed the book peddler's hand away and insisted on opening the pink album.</p><p></p><p>The book peddler's forehead broke into cold sweat like soybeans. Unable to stop him, he looked around and realized that no one had noticed the anomaly here yet.</p><p></p><p>He swiftly left using the teleportation array within the city.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Li Fan was already immersed in a lifelike and vivid illusion.</p><p></p><p>【Qin Shou pursued Zhao Junior Sister many times, repeatedly rejected. In a fit of anger and humiliation, he harbored malicious intent.】</p><p></p><p>【Zhao Junior Sister was hit by the Yin-Yang Union Scatter, and her consciousness sank into the Modu Lake.】</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression kept changing continuously, and even his breathing became rapid.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious pink light on the album seemed to sync with Li Fan's breathing rhythm, constantly flickering.</p><p></p><p>Immersed in it, he was unaffected by the noisy surroundings.</p><p></p><p>He also kept muttering something under his breath.</p><p></p><p>"I can't believe there's such a beauty in the world..."</p><p></p><p>"Truly incompetent! Already had an intimate contact once, and still couldn't seize the opportunity..."</p><p></p><p>"Worthless! Isn't her intention clear enough?"</p><p></p><p>"If not now, then when?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the development in the album's plot did not align with Li Fan's desires. He furrowed his brows from time to time, mumbling angrily under his breath.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, how could there be such a weak protagonist?!"</p><p></p><p>"If it were me, Junior Sister would have surrendered to me long ago..."</p><p></p><p>His words suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan as the center of this puppet body, a small area around him seemed to completely freeze.</p><p></p><p>Even the eerie pink light in the album stayed still in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>Enveloping the motionless Li Fan within it.</p><p></p><p>The bustling Wei Chang City, which was lively due to the battle earlier, suddenly fell into absolute silence.</p><p></p><p>The white light grew stronger, and a pulling force came from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slowly lifted up into the sky as if drawn like a defunct figure.</p><p></p><p>"Guiding Immortal Light! That's the Guiding Immortal Light!"</p><p></p><p>"Who is it? How is it that someone from our Canhong Prefecture has attracted the attention of Lord Tianzun so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, in just a month, three disciples from the Immortal Sect emerged! Our Canhong Prefecture's prestige is truly going to be greatly recognized now!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lü Fan's duel was now disregarded by everyone present.</p><p></p><p>The gazes of all the cultivators present were fixated on the white light column that pierced through heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes were filled with admiration and envy as they stared at the silhouette of Modu in the light pillar, displaying excitement and discussion.</p><p></p><p>Lü Fan also ceased the fight.</p><p></p><p>He stared blankly at the light pillar, feeling the profound pain of losing his beloved right before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>A feeling of heart-wrenching anguish.</p><p></p><p>Victory, cultivation, realms...</p><p></p><p>Everything in the world seemed to lose its meaning in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Why, why..." Lü Fan was at a loss, in a daze.</p><p></p><p>As the figure in the white light pillar rose higher, Lü Fan suddenly felt that the person seemed somewhat familiar.</p><p></p><p>His heart pounding, Lü Fan quickly looked around.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the figure of "Fellow Daoist Jiao" had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?" Disbelief filled Lü Fan's face.</p><p></p><p>"I defeated more than twenty Golden Core elders in the Five Elders Association, didn’t you see? Why did he choose him specifically while ignoring me?"</p><p></p><p>Endless grievances, unwillingness, and anger surged in Lü Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>He roared madly, losing his rationality, and disregarding everything, he rushed towards the light pillar.</p><p></p><p>But to no avail.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to touch the light pillar, the next moment, Lü Fan crashed through the pillar.</p><p></p><p>The light pillar was like a mirage, visible but not touchable.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan in tow, the light pillar gradually disappeared into the sky and earth.</p><p></p><p>A trace of despair appeared in Lü Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, you're awake."</p><p></p><p>A clear voice sounded in his ears, and Li Fan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Cough..." The intense pain in his chest made him involuntarily inhale sharply.</p><p></p><p>"When you first entered the sect, I told you not to act rashly, but you didn't listen." A graceful figure appeared beside Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>She helped Li Fan up and supported him against the bed.</p><p></p><p>"This is the medicine I brewed for you, it will help with your recovery from the injuries. Please drink it quickly." She looked concerned, scooped a spoonful of medicinal soup, and brought it to Li Fan's lips.</p><p></p><p>His mind was muddled, and he couldn't recall anything.</p>

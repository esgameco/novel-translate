            <p>"Since it can be used to grow spirit plants, it should be fine for people to go in and stay for a while," Zhang Haobo immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>"Are you suggesting that by using the cauldron as a boat, we might be able to break through this invisible barrier?" Xiao Heng nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's try it quickly!" Su Xiaomei said, taking out the small Medicine King Cauldron from her storage ring.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!" Xiao Heng was about to say something, but Su Xiaomei had already turned into a stream of light and entered the cauldron.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly come in, both of you!" Su Xiaomei's voice came from inside the cauldron.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhang Haobo and Xiao Heng had no choice but to enter as well.</p><p></p><p>After spinning in the air for a moment, this ancient-looking Medicine King Cauldron twisted and turned, charging forward.</p><p></p><p>At the moment of hitting the transparent barrier, a layer of green light barrier appeared.</p><p></p><p>The small cauldron was about to successfully enter.</p><p></p><p>A sudden change occurred.</p><p></p><p>The light barrier suddenly disappeared, and the small Medicine King Cauldron hit nothing but empty space.</p><p></p><p>Unable to enter the true Medicine King Cauldron, Xiao Heng and the others had to fly out of the small cauldron again.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, why couldn't we get in?" Su Xiaomei felt a bit frustrated.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps... it's because there are too many of us?" Xiao Heng speculated.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Skull prepared four for us, we shouldn't try to take shortcuts," Zhang Haobo agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's try again!" Su Xiaomei acted decisively, re-entering the small cauldron and heading towards the barrier.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng and Zhang Haobo watched closely for any changes at the transparent barrier.</p><p></p><p>As expected, the small Medicine King Cauldron flew and touched the barrier.</p><p></p><p>It neither passed through directly nor was blocked like an attack.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it fluctuated for a moment and then disappeared from their sight like melting ice in water.</p><p></p><p>"It indeed works!"</p><p></p><p>Xiao and Zhang exchanged a glance, feeling excited.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>To avoid staying too long in dreams, the two immediately followed suit, each controlling a small cauldron and charging forward.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Li Fan in Lanlin Prefecture had completed the verification of the Tianxuan Locking Spirit Array with Huangfu Song. After bidding farewell to Guan Xingxiu, they were now heading to the western Qinghuang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>It had to be said that these remote areas in the south were all in the same boat. Essentially, they were all lagging behind the entire Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Building them all at the last minute saved Li Fan and the others the trouble of running around.</p><p></p><p>They only needed to go through one by one for verification.</p><p></p><p>At the moment when Xiao Heng and the others entered the True Medicine King Cauldron, the scene sensed by the Untraceable Killing Intent suddenly disappeared simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Even though Xiao Heng and the others carried amplifying sensing arrays with them, they still couldn't receive any transmitted images.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan remained unfazed.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I have made other preparations."</p><p></p><p>To prevent another situation like losing contact immediately after entering the Chao Yuan Sect and thus not knowing anything about their situation, Li Fan, besides the sensing array, also engraved a hidden recording array in his necklace.</p><p></p><p>It would accurately record surrounding scenes and wait to transmit them to Li Fan once contact was reestablished through the sensing array.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I just need to wait patiently."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes slightly and once again immersed his mind in the comprehension of his divine powers.</p><p></p><p>â€¦</p><p></p><p>Cangwu Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The True Medicine King</p><p></p><p>The surroundings suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>Caught off guard, Xiao Heng appeared somewhat embarrassed for a moment. When he stabilized his figure, he found that Zhang Haobo was in the same situation.</p><p></p><p>They were in a desolate closed area.</p><p></p><p>The top and boundaries of the area were covered by metal walls emitting a faint blue light.</p><p></p><p>The small Medicine King Cauldron that had brought them here was now nowhere to be found.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Heng, come here quickly!" Su Xiaomei's voice came from not far ahead, and Xiao Heng and Zhang Haobo hurried over.</p><p></p><p>A huge bronze gate stood tall.</p><p></p><p>On the gate, there was a round tripod design with three legs and two ears carved onto it.</p><p></p><p>Judging by its appearance, it was undoubtedly the rumored True Medicine King Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>"This should be the True Medicine King Cauldron as described on it." Xiao Heng pondered.</p><p></p><p>"I just checked around, and there is no other exit here except for this bronze gate," Su Xiaomei said. "But this gate cannot be opened now."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhang Haobo exerted his strength, placing his palms on the bronze gate.</p><p></p><p>With a sudden force.</p><p></p><p>The bronze gate didn't budge.</p><p></p><p>"How about attacking it?" Xiao Heng suggested.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Zhang Haobo slowly nodded.</p><p></p><p>Stepping back a bit, Zhang Haobo's head suddenly revealed an illusion of a sea of blood.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Sea Cave Heaven... I can't believe someone as amiable as Zhang Haobo has such a terrifying Cave Heaven," Xiao Heng took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Even though it wasn't the first time he saw this scene, facing the overwhelming hostility emanating from the boundless blood sea, Xiao Heng still felt a bit nervous.</p><p></p><p>The blood surged, and countless blood-colored long swords flew out from the sea.</p><p></p><p>With a pointed finger, Zhang Haobo sent them hurtling toward the bronze gate in front.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A loud explosion echoed repeatedly, and the bronze gate, as well as the entire space, seemed to be shaking.</p><p></p><p>After a while.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo retracted the Blood Sea Cave Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the unchanged bronze gate, he furrowed his brow and said, "It's no use. The protective force here is obviously not something an Infant-stage cultivator can break through."</p><p></p><p>Even the usually irritable Su Xiaomei did not retort at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Instead, she stared blankly, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng also pondered the way to deal with the situation.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, an eerie silence enveloped the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"I've got it!" Suddenly, Su Xiaomei exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>"What do you know?" Xiao Heng looked at Su Xiaomei curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Ding, the ding," Su Xiaomei looked at Xiao Heng, urging him. "You still have one small cauldron left. Look at this gate; it must be a mechanism. Just like the barrier outside, it definitely has a mechanism to discern friend from foe."</p><p></p><p>"In the past, the disciples of the Medicine King Sect could enter by operating the sect's cultivation techniques."</p><p></p><p>"We surely can't do that. But we can deceive it with the small Medicine King Cauldron like we did outside."</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng nodded in agreement at first.</p><p></p><p>But then his face suddenly changed, and he swiftly retreated, his expression turning grim as he shouted, "You are not Su Xiaomei! Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei was stunned at first, then her face flushed red in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Heng! Are you asking for trouble?" A red sun appeared above her head.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng, now sporting bruises and a swollen face, solemnly apologized to Su Xiaomei.</p><p></p><p>"Little sister, I'm sorry."</p><p></p><p>"Sorry for what? Am I that foolish in your eyes?" Su Xiaomei snorted coldly, turned her head away, refusing to look at him.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 934</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In just a few breaths, Li Fan, the holy fetus, directly ascended from a mortal to the early stage of Qi Refining, completely ignoring the existence of the Heavenly Tribulation and continuing towards the perfection of Qi Refining, until he stopped due to the lack of a foundation-building rare treasure.</p><p></p><p>This time, he didn't choose any particularly special treasure, but Li Fan's true body and his clone worked together to create a low-grade human rare treasure out of thin air using the Dao of the Sword, serving as the material for the holy fetus' advancement.</p><p></p><p>With this "Unyielding Sword" as the foundation, the holy fetus was able to continue receiving the vast cultivation base transmitted by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Using the Dao of the Sword to form the golden core method was already a familiar process. As for the blessed land needed for the holy fetus to advance to the Nascent Soul stage, Li Fan directly cut out a small portion from his own Five Elements Great Blessed Land.</p><p></p><p>In this way, in just three days, another Nascent Soul early-stage clone was created. However, compared to Li Qing, the holy fetus was ridiculously weak.</p><p></p><p>It merely had the cultivation level but lacked real combat power. If they truly fought, the holy fetus might not even be a match for an ordinary Nascent Soul cultivator from the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But as a disposable item dispatched to carry out dangerous missions, it was enough.</p><p></p><p>After preparing all the necessary supplies for the holy fetus, under Li Fan's manipulation, the holy fetus flew out of the Lingmu Realm, unaware of anything until it was half a continent away from the entrance, only then fully waking up.</p><p></p><p>The mission requirements surged in its mind, and the holy fetus unhurriedly headed towards the destination.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Li Fan looked at Li Qing, "I have removed the imprint left on you by the new protective grand formation."</p><p></p><p>"But you should also refrain from going out recently. Just focus on condensing the Dao of the Sword."</p><p></p><p>"I have a premonition that the chaos in the Xuanhuang Realm is not far away."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said this not without reason.</p><p></p><p>Just now, in He Zhenghao's memories, he saw a familiar figure.</p><p></p><p>Gongsun Qixuan from the Heavenly Mechanism Hall of the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>This person's cultivation was not very strong, and he didn't seem to be proficient in formations.</p><p></p><p>However, he happened to appear at the Myriad Immortals Alliance's Formation Hall headquarters.</p><p></p><p>It had to be said that it was very suspicious.</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to the 115th world, when the Profound Net underwent strange changes, it was precisely this person who served as the fuse.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could almost be certain that there must be some subtle connection between this person and the Profound Heavenly Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Let the fighting begin. The fiercer, the better."</p><p></p><p>"Let me see what cards you all have up your sleeves."</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Realm, cultivators like Li Fan who looked forward to a war between two behemoths all day were truly rare.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of cultivators still hoped to spend their lives in peace and stability.</p><p></p><p>They had never even imagined the Myriad Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Association engaging in a thorough great war.</p><p></p><p>After all, when war broke out, countless lives would be lost.</p><p></p><p>If there were no irreconcilable conflicts, why would they have to fight?</p><p></p><p>However, on this day, the Myriad Immortals Alliance directly found an excuse to declare war.</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elders Association must promptly return the lost treasure of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. If it is not returned, the alliance's army will personally retrieve it."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The alliance cultivators looked at this abrupt and somewhat inexplicable declaration, all looking at each other in dismay.</p><p></p><p>"What is the alliance's lost treasure? And how could it be with the Five Elders Association?"</p><p></p><p>"This excuse... is too crude, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>Just as the cultivators were puzzled and perplexed, a detailed explanation was quickly published.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that...</p><p></p><p>I'm sorry, but I cannot translate this excerpt as it appears to be incomplete. The text you provided seems to be cut off in the middle of a sentence, making it difficult to understand the full context and meaning. If you could provide the complete excerpt, I would be happy to translate it from Chinese to English for you.</p>

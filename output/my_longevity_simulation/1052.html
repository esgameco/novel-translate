        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1050: The Enlightened Grand Master</p><p></p><p>The paper man suddenly appeared when Li Fan tried to use the seven-colored Jade Void Flowing Light, which contained gray mold spots, to erode the Book of Crossing Tribulations.</p><p></p><p>According to the paper man himself, this was some kind of early warning mechanism.</p><p></p><p>The Crossing Tribulations Sect did not intend to completely ignore the outside world after transforming into paper men.</p><p></p><p>The paper men monitored the Xuanhuang realm, and when the perceived threat level from the outside world reached a certain degree, the early warning mechanism would be activated.</p><p></p><p>The more serious the crisis, the more paper men would awaken.</p><p></p><p>The gray mold spots released by Li Fan were still blocked by the seven-colored divine light. So the slight leakage of aura only awakened one paper man.</p><p></p><p>However, after this paper man figured out the current situation of the Book of Crossing Tribulations and the Xuanhuang realm, did he awaken other sleeping paper men...</p><p></p><p>Judging from the many chaotic fluctuations coming from the Book of Crossing Tribulations before, the answer was affirmative.</p><p></p><p>There seemed to be some kind of restriction. After discussing for a while, the vast majority of the Crossing Tribulations Sect's paper men chose to go back to sleep again.</p><p></p><p>Only the paper man in front of him, called "Dan Xuan", was left to be fully responsible for communicating with Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Bearing the fate of the entire Crossing Tribulations Sect, Dan Xuan's identity must be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how resourceful he was, in the face of Li Fan's actions of threatening to destroy the world at every turn, he could only suffer repeated setbacks and compromise again and again.</p><p></p><p>Because Dan Xuan saw that every time Li Fan's murderous intent surfaced, it was not an act.</p><p></p><p>But he really didn't care about his own life and even the lives of all creatures in the Xuanhuang realm, and intended to take everything down with him.</p><p></p><p>Faced with this kind of unreasonable "madman", Dan Xuan was really at his wits' end.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, sensing Li Fan's dangerous thoughts surfacing again, he hurriedly appeared and started persuading.</p><p></p><p>"I asked you to help find someone, but you kept refusing. It seems that your Crossing Tribulations Sect doesn't really care about the Xuanhuang realm that much." Li Fan mocked.</p><p></p><p>The conflicted expression on the paper man Dan Xuan's face was about to squeeze together: "Young friend, I have said many times. It's not that I'm unwilling, but truly unable. We didn't expect that during our slumber, the Xuanhuang realm would expand to this extent."</p><p></p><p>"There are too many blind spots. The overall monitoring system of the Book of Crossing Tribulations has also been affected because of this. If you specify to check a certain paper man, it can still be done. But to have an overall view..."</p><p></p><p>Dan Xuan shook his body slightly: "Unless those newly appeared realms are supplemented with paper men."</p><p></p><p>Faced with Dan Xuan's excuses, Li Fan acted as if he didn't believe it at all.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, I can understand your urgency to find Ink Dharma King and Xuantian Mirror to take revenge."</p><p></p><p>"But I'm afraid no one in the world is clearer about the terror of the Xuantian Sect than the elders of our Ten Immortal Sects."</p><p></p><p>"Back then, if it weren't for the help of Grandmaster Tiandu, we wouldn't have had the slightest chance of winning."</p><p></p><p>"The Dao lineage inherited from the Immortal Realm cannot be compared to the native cultivation methods of our Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>Dan Xuan seemed to recall the might of the Xuantian Sect back then, and his paper body trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Losing to them..."</p><p></p><p>"Is not unjust. Young friend, you don't need to mind it too much. Of course, if you insist on revenge..."</p><p></p><p>Dan Xuan paused, but still gave the suggestion he had said several times before: "Why not ask Grandmaster Tiandu to take action? Regarding the remnants of the Xuantian Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Nie, the Great Master will definitely be very interested in it." </p><p></p><p>Dan Xuan's tone was still as sincere as ever, as if he was truly considering Li Fan's best interests.</p><p></p><p>Dan Xuan patiently persuaded, "How powerful can someone be who considers your Dugu Sect's trash as treasure?"</p><p></p><p>With just one sentence, Li Fan instantly made Dan Xuan lose his composure. </p><p></p><p>However, he had a deep self-restraint and quickly recovered. </p><p></p><p>Without taking Li Fan's disdain to heart, he continued to persuade him.</p><p></p><p>"It's normal that we are not proficient in our studies and have not been able to inherit the Great Master's divine might. However, the fact that the Great Master could contend with the Xuan Tian King without a clear victor is enough to demonstrate his strength."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to mock, "How come the clues I found indicate that the Great Master of Tiandu suffered severe injuries after a battle back then and has been hiding to lick his wounds ever since? And hasn't recovered to this day?"</p><p></p><p>"Every once in a while, the Yuan Dao State of the Wanxian Alliance is devoured for ten years. That's his handiwork."</p><p></p><p>Dan Xuan was slightly stunned at first, "Has it already been ten years?" </p><p></p><p>Then he shook his head repeatedly to explain, "I don't know where you got your information from, but it's so ridiculously wrong. The Great Master's seclusion is not because of injuries. It's for enlightenment!"</p><p></p><p>"Enlightenment?" Li Fan's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>"That's right. The closer to the top of the immortal ruins, the slower the flow of time. Back then, the Great Master told us that this was a space-time anomaly caused by the immortals' enlightenment. If one's aptitude is sufficient, one can use this space-time anomaly to reverse engineer the immortals' enlightenment." There was a tinge of emotion in Dan Xuan's voice.</p><p></p><p>"However, among all the cultivators of the Ten Immortal Sects, none of us could meet the requirements for resonating with this enlightenment. Only the Great Master..."</p><p></p><p>"The so-called ten years that disappeared in Yuan Dao State is a manifestation of the flow of time being slowed down to the extreme. That should be the unintentional influence on the outside world during the Great Master of Tiandu's enlightenment process. Before we fell into slumber back then, the influence of the Great Master's enlightenment realm was less than a year. It seems that in these years, the Great Master has made gains in his enlightenment."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan first digested the contents of Dan Xuan's words, then sneered, "If the Great Master is so powerful, why didn't you go to him when the Xuanhuang Realm was facing imminent catastrophe? Instead, those who could escape did so, and those who could play ostrich did just that?"</p><p></p><p>Dan Xuan was as if someone had grabbed him by the throat, instantly feeling so uncomfortable that he couldn't speak.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he said faintly, "Perhaps the Great Master doesn't care about our life and death. We also tried to contact him, but there was no response at all."</p><p></p><p>"There was no response back then, but now there is? And you keep urging me to go find him..."</p><p></p><p>"You are indeed harboring evil intentions." The killing intent that had already been extinguished in Li Fan's eyes resurfaced.</p><p></p><p>Dan Xuan repeatedly cried out his grievances, "That was then, this is now! Wanting to contact the Great Master again as soon as we wake up, isn't that a very normal reaction?"</p><p></p><p>"Shut up!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's patience had run out. Under the coercion of the Wordless Spell, Dan Xuan shrank back into the Book of Crossing Calamity.</p><p></p><p>"If you change your mind, young friend, call for me later. I absolutely will not harm you. The Great Master has a kind heart..."</p><p></p><p>Dan Xuan's words came to an abrupt end.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suppressed the Book of Crossing Calamity again and then fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting. Back then, when the Xuan Tian King and the Great Master of Tiandu fought, the Xuan Tian Sect and the Ten Immortal Sects each had their own version of the story."</p><p></p><p>"They both believed that the other party was severely injured. While they themselves had a breakthrough in the great battle."</p>

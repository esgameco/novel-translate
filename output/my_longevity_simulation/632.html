            <p>Later, he smiled and said, "Xin Xin, you're overthinking! As the current head of the Congyunhai, I spend my days managing political affairs at the Political Affairs Hall and do not go out traveling. How could I encounter any danger?"</p><p></p><p>"That's true!" Seeing her father not believing her, He Xinxin stomped her foot irritably.</p><p></p><p>Approaching him, she whispered, "Father, you don't know, but my foundational artifact, named Dao Wen Luo Pan, has been with me since childhood. The cultivation technique tailored for me is called Dao Wang Tian Luo, which my mother specially sought for me..."</p><p></p><p>After listening to his daughter's explanations, He Zhenghao was slightly astonished.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that by following the secret envoy, he had made a name for himself and earned enough merit. He considered himself somewhat notable. However, compared to the Heng family in Tianyu Prefecture, a powerful cultivation family, he was still far behind.</p><p></p><p>At least, the fact that his cultivation technique was personally designed for him was something he couldn't achieve at present.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, He Zhenghao couldn't help but feel a bit bitter.</p><p></p><p>"There is indeed a life-threatening danger, Father, you should come with me." He Xinxin persisted in persuading He Zhenghao, repeating it again and ultimately arrived at the same heart-pounding conclusion. She couldn't help but persuade him once more in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing her serious tone, He Zhenghao also started to have doubts.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, how could there be a life-threatening crisis in Congyun City? I have been minding my own business, not doing anything to offend the secret envoy recently." After a careful thought, He Zhenghao furrowed his brows even tighter, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Five Elders are using their old tricks again, planning to sneak attack Congyun Immortal City?" Suddenly, He Zhenghao remembered the events from the past in Congyunhai, and couldn't help but be surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... we just had a friendly exchange meeting recently?" He became somewhat hesitant.</p><p></p><p>Walking back and forth in the room, his face was filled with anxiety.</p><p></p><p>Watching her father hesitating and unable to make a decision, He Xinxin couldn't help but feel a sense of urgency.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, He Zhenghao's response was quite different from what she anticipated, "After hearing the deduction results, he did not immediately ignore everything and follow her back to Tianyu Prefecture." The young girl couldn't help but feel a bit upset, blaming her father for not trusting her.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao did not notice the inexplicable change in his daughter's heart, he was still hesitating.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he didn't believe his daughter. Having personally experienced various things in the past, he was very clear about the power of the Heng family in Tianyu Prefecture. The cultivation technique, Dao Wang Tian Luo, created for He Xinxin indeed seemed extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>But, for He Zhenghao, who had transformed from a destitute guardian of an island town to a crucial figure in Congyunhai, receiving numerous cultivators trying to please him, it was not easy. How could he easily give up just because of his daughter's words?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his roots were in Congyunhai. Without the network of relationships carefully cultivated by him here, he would be nothing.</p><p></p><p>Even if he returned to Tianyu Prefecture, what then?</p><p></p><p>A very ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator like him would not even qualify to be a guard for the Heng family.</p><p></p><p>How could he face Heng Ruoshui?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After carefully considering it, He Zhenghao had made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>His eyes lit up, and with a smile, he said, "Xinxin..."</p><p></p><p>He Xinxin glared at He Zhenghao with frustration.</p><p></p><p>Feeling slightly embarrassed, He Zhenghao said solemnly, "I know you care about me, and I understand your cultivation technique is exceptional. But in this world, things are unpredictable, and deduction techniques are just deductions."</p><p></p><p>"It only reveals potential outcomes for the future, whether they will actually happen..."</p><p></p><p>"I think even the Supreme Immortal of Longevity wouldn't dare to guarantee everything." He Xinxin was a bit dissatisfied with his words but didn't know how to argue at the moment.</p><p></p><p>At this point, He Zhenghao spoke again, "Moreover, speaking of deduction techniques, the highest authority in Congyunhai, my immediate superior, the secret envoy of Congyunhai, the ancient Tianji Sect cultivator: Li Fan, is definitely much stronger than you!"</p><p></p><p>"His skills are truly astounding and extraordinary! I am a confidant of the secret envoy, so if there was really any danger, how could he not warn me?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, He Xinxin widened her eyes, "Tianji Sect's Li Fan?"</p><p></p><p>She had also heard of Li Fan's name before. He accurately predicted several major events about to happen in the Immortal Alliance, things that she was unable to do.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that she really made a mistake? He Xinxin couldn't help but hesitate for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the effect, He Zhenghao quickly seized the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"If you are still worried, I will ask the secret envoy myself in front of you."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, He Zhenghao took out the divine jade token left by Li Fan and summoned his image.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Li Fan's virtual figure appeared in the room.</p><p></p><p>"What do you need?" Li Fan had no expression on his face and spoke lightly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, his gaze inadvertently passed over He Xinxin.</p><p></p><p>The young girl, daring and unafraid, met Li Fan's gaze.</p><p></p><p>It was He Zhenghao who was nodding humbly, whispering.</p><p></p><p>"Dare I ask, sir, will there be any changes in Congyunhai recently?" After explaining, he looked hopefully at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>There was a moment of silence in the room.</p><p></p><p>In the picture, the Tian Di Qian Kun dice seemed to keep spinning in Li Fan's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Wen Luo Pan? The reputation of the Heng family of Tianyu truly lives up to its name."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Li Fan did not directly answer He Zhenghao's question but gazed at He Xinxin, admiringly.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's heart trembled, not expecting the secret envoy to discern his daughter's abilities with just a glance.</p><p></p><p>He Xinxin's mouth gaped in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"The sir is flattering..." He Zhenghao said repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Incredible, indeed." Li Fan shook his head slightly, seemingly reminded of something, looking melancholic.</p><p></p><p>With that, he pointed towards He Xinxin's forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Sir!" He Zhenghao's expression changed slightly, but soon realized that Li Fan had no ill intentions, and was teaching something to his daughter. Thus, he felt somewhat reassured.</p><p></p><p>Before long, golden lights dispersed, and He Xinxin regained consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Looking into her mind where sudden knowledge had appeared.</p><p></p><p>"The Laws of the Great Universe," "Secrets of a Thousand Machines," "The Cycle of Qi Transformation"...</p><p></p><p>These were ancient Tianji Sect works?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they were versions she had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>He Xinxin's eyes brightened, filled with joy.</p><p></p><p>With a smile on her face, she immediately paid her respects and whispered, "Thank you, sir."</p><p></p><p>"No need to be so polite, it's rare to find a suitable individual. Besides, it's not considered a precious item." Li Fan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Then, he looked at He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>"Will there be changes in Congyunhai?" Li Fan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"I won't leave, He Zhenghao, what are you afraid of?"</p>

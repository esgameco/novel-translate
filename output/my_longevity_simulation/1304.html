        <h1>Chapter 1304</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I have also tried to follow the mysterious feeling to search for this person's whereabouts. However, it always ended in failure..." The Holy Emperor said while feeling the rising wind in the Star Sea.</p><p></p><p>The revival of the Star Sea and the resistance against the remnant power of the True Immortals was a rather lengthy process.</p><p></p><p>Converted to the human time scale, it would last for more than a decade.</p><p></p><p>Before this Star Sea storm reached its peak, he could go to war with the Dharma Transmission at any time.</p><p></p><p>Temporary cooperation did not mean eternal reconciliation.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the fact that their strengths were indeed evenly matched and it was difficult to determine the winner, there were also some considerations of buying time in choosing to cease fire and pursue the mastermind behind the scenes first.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's gaze inadvertently swept over the distant Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The increasing number of Foundation Establishment cultivators from my side was weakening the foundation of the Dharma Transmission.</p><p></p><p>The plan of the Stone Tablet and Ruomu to establish the Xuanhuang orthodoxy was also progressing more rapidly as the Holy Dynasty took over a large number of territories originally belonging to the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>As the Star Sea storm gradually intensified until it reached its peak, any delay was advantageous to the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Since the Dharma Transmission took the initiative to propose it, the Holy Emperor naturally jumped at the chance.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the action of fishing for treasures in the fishing pool had never stopped for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps during this period, some supreme treasure that could turn the tide of the battle would be fished up again.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of his rapidly turning thoughts, he used the Star Constellation Giant Net to complete the instructions to his subordinates. During the conversation with the Dharma Transmission, the Holy Emperor forced out a drop of blood from his glabella.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmission lightly coughed and first restored his high crown that had been cut off in the previous battle.</p><p></p><p>Then, surging light concealed the small wounds all over his body.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the Holy Emperor pondered: "Could it be that the Dharma Transmission is buying time to take the opportunity to comprehend the principle of 'the false is also true'?"</p><p></p><p>Although he had such a guess in his heart, the Holy Emperor was not worried that the Dharma Transmission would be able to comprehend it during this time.</p><p></p><p>Because the Holy Emperor had a vague feeling that this method of "the true becomes false and the false becomes true" had its own peculiarities.</p><p></p><p>It was not something that could be understood simply by relying on a heaven-defying comprehension ability.</p><p></p><p>While the Holy Emperor was pondering, the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerable, who had already restored his original appearance of a compassionate old man with a high crown, made a series of hand seals to envelop the Holy Emperor's blood in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>The color of the light kept changing and finally settled on a pale yellow color that was extremely similar to the appearance of the Xuanhuang world.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the Dharma Transmission's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>However, his hands did not stop and he continued to cast spells.</p><p></p><p>In the pale yellow light sphere, the blood struggled violently as if it had come to life.</p><p></p><p>Then it split into two protrusions.</p><p></p><p>One of them pointed in the direction of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>And the other...</p><p></p><p>It actually pointed outside the Star Sea!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was still spinning violently!</p><p></p><p>"How could this..." Seeing the Dharma Transmission's increasingly solemn expression, the Holy Emperor also became grave. He had just started to ask, but before he could finish his sentence.</p><p></p><p>The space around them suddenly became turbulent.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the storm caused by the revival power of the Star Sea, it was more like something was about to break out of the ground and drill out from the bottom.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor and the Dharma Transmission both flashed away and retreated far to avoid it.</p><p></p><p>They watched as the protrusion that was spinning in the blood wrapped in the pale yellow light sphere gradually stopped.</p><p></p><p>Quietly pointing forward.</p><p></p><p>After a moment...</p><p></p><p>Ripples that were barely perceptible came from the front.</p><p></p><p>As if a drop of water had just fallen.</p><p></p><p>Neither divine sense nor sight found the target, but both the Holy Emperor and the Dharma Transmission knew that something had just descended in front of them.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmission narrowed his eyes slightly, seeming to show a trace of reminiscence.</p><p></p><p>But when he looked at the Holy Emperor's blood drop again, a hint of puzzlement flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting. That mastermind behind the scenes actually took the initiative to show up..."</p><p></p><p>In the pale yellow light sphere, the Holy Emperor's blood drop slowly burned out.</p><p></p><p>However, the protruding part still firmly pointed to the void in front.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Boat..." The Dharma Transmission murmured in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor also narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He was naturally clear about the sword light message that had appeared outside the Xuanhuang Realm before.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, his mind was filled with thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that there is really a conspiracy involving this Immortal Boat behind the scenes?" The Holy Emperor's heart trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"The timing of this flying boat's appearance is too coincidental." The Holy Emperor stared ahead and did not take action first.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanxian Boat is a remnant of the ancient Xuanshang Immortal Boat. It has been hiding in the endless ruins under the high wall..." The Dharma Transmission briefly introduced the background of the Xuanxian Boat in front of them to the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the magnificent scene at the edge of the Star Sea and under the high wall, the Holy Emperor was momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>But precisely because of this, it highlighted the terrifying nature of the high wall that firmly sealed off this part of the Star Sea.</p><p></p><p>"As you and I fought fiercely, they appeared here..."</p><p></p><p>"Let this old man see how much progress the Xuanxian Boat has made over these years." A cold light flashed in the Dharma Transmission's eyes.</p><p></p><p>His figure remained motionless, only giving a light glance.</p><p></p><p>The space in front that had been rippling due to the passage of the Xuanxian Boat slowly became calm.</p><p></p><p>Then, as if an icy seal had descended, the space gradually fell into absolute stillness.</p><p></p><p>No fluctuations emanated from that dead zone, as if it were the end of the Star Sea world.</p><p></p><p>"The divine powers of the Dharma Transmission are indeed extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the Holy Emperor's pupils contracted slightly. He thought in his mind about how he should deal with this move if it were him.</p><p></p><p>The absolute ice seal could not last.</p><p></p><p>Just before it was completely finished, a crude force suddenly surged.</p><p></p><p>It completely shattered the ice-sealed realm.</p><p></p><p>The image of the Xuanxian Boat flashed by.</p><p></p><p>The power released by the Xuanxian Boat not only broke the Dharma Transmission's ice-sealed realm, but also resonated with many remnant immortal powers in this part of the Star Sea.</p><p></p><p>Like a hundred rivers converging, it rushed over in an instant.</p><p></p><p>If the trap that the Holy Emperor had set up before by diverting the flow was a stream of remnant True Immortal power.</p><p></p><p>Then what was stirred up at this moment was a mighty river.</p><p></p><p>Because they were resisting the revival power of the Star Sea, those remnant True Immortal powers were already far more active than usual.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, being attracted and sensing the aura of the Dharma Transmission and the Holy Emperor's living beings, they chased after them like beasts that had caught the scent of prey.</p><p></p><p>Both of them were forced to evade.</p><p></p><p>Although the two had already reached the Star Sea limit known as the Supreme.</p><p></p><p>Facing the remnant power of the True Immortals that could contend with the Star Sea itself, they were still very wary.</p><p></p><p>Especially since the two were still in a state of cooperation and hostility, if one side suffered heavy injuries, it would undoubtedly fall into a disadvantage in the decisive battle later.</p><p></p><p>After all, the remnant power of the True Immortals was different from ordinary moves and could not be easily expelled.</p><p></p><p>Relying on his connection with the Star Sea, the Holy Emperor could see the remnant power of the True Immortals surging in like a tide and deftly evaded them.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, when it was really unavoidable, the flashing of the starlight robe and the prayers coming from the Holy Dynasty's great enlightenment could quickly expel the remnant power of the True Immortals with the essence of the source power that emerged.</p><p></p><p>As for the Dharma Transmission's methods, they were quite peculiar.</p><p></p><p>He took out that long arm composed of countless destroyed worlds again.</p><p></p><p>Like two sponges, it absorbed all the raging remnant power of the True Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Some of the remnant worlds were completely turned to ashes under the baptism of the remnant power of the True Immortals.</p><p></p><p>However, other remnant worlds quickly supplemented the inside of the long arm.</p><p></p><p>One really didn't know how many world fragments like this the Dharma Transmission had collected over the years.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Dharma Transmission and the Holy Emperor resolve the crisis so easily, the Xuanxian Boat, which had failed to divert the trouble, made another move.</p><p></p><p>An earth-yellow paper talisman slowly fell from the void.</p><p></p><p>It seemed slow and leisurely.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was extremely swift.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor and the Dharma Transmission had just sensed the existence of this talisman in the previous moment, and in the next instant, this talisman had already fallen on their heads.</p><p></p><p>This was the peculiarity of this paper talisman.</p><p></p><p>When it first floated down, there was clearly only one. But because there were two targets, it fell on the heads of both at the same time.</p><p></p><p>"True Immortal Seal Script..."</p><p></p><p>This thought flashed through the minds of the Holy Emperor and the Dharma Transmission at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they felt the power contained in this True Immortal Seal Script.</p><p></p><p>First, the Holy Emperor noticed that his connection with the Abyssal Star Sea was severed.</p><p></p><p>It was not directly cut off by the True Immortal Seal Script, but the Star Sea's origin had actively severed the connection.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor could even vaguely feel the hostility coming from the Star Sea before the loss of contact.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he could consider it as half of his home field, with the power of the Star Sea assisting his every move. But now, it was as if he was in a quagmire, and every action was met with great resistance.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmission, who was originally regarded as a temporary cooperation partner, the Holy Emperor also felt a strong malice from him.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, looking around, there were only enemies!</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor, who had never experienced such an encounter before, looked around and his thoughts turned rapidly.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the power of the True Immortal Seal Script?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not the remnant power that can be seen everywhere in the Star Sea, but the complete power of a True Immortal..."</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the Holy Emperor tried to recall the pattern on the paper talisman he had just seen.</p><p></p><p>He actually couldn't remember a single detail.</p><p></p><p>While trying to find a way to deal with the increasingly dense hostile forces around him, the Holy Emperor looked at the Dharma Transmission not far away.</p><p></p><p>Due to the thickening hostility, the distance between them had unknowingly widened a lot compared to before.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmission's high crown emitted a jade-like silver light.</p><p></p><p>It reflected the statues of the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerable standing in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>One of the statues walked out from the high crown.</p><p></p><p>In a flash of light, it became a real entity.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the statue condensed, it was attacked by all the surrounding forces. The power of the Star Sea, the remnant power of the True Immortals, and even the Dharma Transmission himself...</p><p></p><p>The statue shattered with a bang. The violent explosion caused by the collision of multiple forces swept past and reached the Holy Emperor's position.</p><p></p><p>It actually changed targets again and surged towards the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>As if it had truly seen some irreconcilable enemy.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor solemnly resolved this impact. At the same time, he continued to observe the Dharma Transmission's actions.</p><p></p><p>As another statue walked out from the high crown and was jointly smashed to pieces by multiple forces.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor sensed that the power of the True Immortal Seal Script condensed on the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerable's body had weakened a little.</p><p></p><p>"Is this using the stone statues to fake death and substitute himself to reduce the hostility?"</p><p></p><p>With his outstanding comprehension ability, the Holy Emperor quickly understood the Dharma Transmission's intention.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, a vague phantom of the Holy Emperor also walked out from the starlight holy robe.</p><p></p><p>As expected, the moment the phantom was differentiated, it was suddenly attacked by all the surrounding forces.</p><p></p><p>Including the Holy Emperor himself.</p><p></p><p>Even when the Holy Emperor struck his own differentiated phantom, he felt a slight pleasure of revenge being completed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He and the Dharma Transmission had both reached the limit of the Star Sea.</p><p></p><p>But after being affected by the True Immortal Seal Script, they were helpless to fight back.</p><p></p><p>It was only by using this kind of "dead method" that they could slowly resolve the influence of the True Immortal Seal Script.</p><p></p><p>They simply couldn't contend with it using power of the same level.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, after manifesting the Eternal Xuanhuang Realm and relying on the comprehension of 'the false is also true', it can be resisted."</p><p></p><p>"As for the other means I currently possess..."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor quickly went through them in his mind, but couldn't find any that could be compared with it.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a rather ridiculous scene appeared in the Star Sea.</p><p></p><p>The two Supreme experts were pinned in place by a True Immortal Seal Script out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>And the Xuanxian Boat, which had been observing in the dark for a while, finally made another move.</p><p></p><p>The somewhat disheveled Holy Emperor heard a message transmission in his ear.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanxian Boat only seeks the materials to survive in the Star Sea."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps we can cooperate with each other."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor was startled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the Holy Emperor did not respond for a long time, the Xuanxian Boat sent another message.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A message arrived: "We can help your Holy Dynasty deal with Chuanfa. However, after the matter is settled, you will need to provide us with a place to reside."</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, the total number of people on the Xuan Immortal Boat is no more than 100,000. The Xuanhuang Realm is so vast that adding us won't make much difference."</p><p></p><p>The message from the Xuan Immortal Boat was very sincere. </p><p></p><p>This made the Holy Emperor even more puzzled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the previous guidance from Chuanfa's bloodline, pointing out that there might be a hidden mastermind on that immortal boat, the Holy Emperor might have been truly tempted.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor silently pondered what exactly this Xuan Immortal Boat was trying to do.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that they saw I reached a cooperation with Chuanfa, so they came out again to sow discord?"</p><p></p><p>Almost as a matter of course, the Holy Emperor thought so.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor did not respond for a long time.</p><p></p><p>This made the Holy Emperor's heart tremble violently.</p><p></p><p>"Chuanfa absolutely cannot be trusted!"</p><p></p><p>"Many years ago, this person infiltrated our immortal boat under the pretext of observing and stole many secret treasures from the boat!"</p><p></p><p>"Although he changed his appearance back then, he can't deceive us..."</p><p></p><p>A lot of information was transmitted in succession.</p><p></p><p>It made the Holy Emperor fall into silence again.</p><p></p><p>"If you are interested, use this method to contact us."</p><p></p><p>The chaos caused by the True Immortal seal characters gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the Holy Emperor had not replied for a long time, the Xuan Immortal Boat could only leave behind a secret method.</p><p></p><p>The figure completely disappeared from sight.</p><p></p><p>The turmoil settled, and the hostility from the mortal world also slowly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The connection with the starry sea was also being restored.</p><p></p><p>However, the Holy Emperor and Chuanfa, who had already distanced themselves, did not get close again.</p><p></p><p>"Although he ran away, we can still use fellow Daoist's bloodline to lock onto their location." Chuanfa looked at the Holy Emperor and said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"This Xuan Immortal Boat is indeed troublesome, coming and going without a trace. Can't fellow Daoist track its whereabouts?" The Holy Emperor still did not force out more blood, but asked this instead.</p><p></p><p>Chuanfa laughed lightly: "This Xuan Immortal Boat has indeed made some progress over the years. Their research on True Immortal seal characters has actually reached this level. Although in our eyes, they have just gone astray. But I have to say..."</p><p></p><p>Chuanfa looked towards the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>"It's indeed a bit troublesome in this darkest starry sea."</p><p></p><p>"Small-scale remnants of True Immortal power may not be feared. But if they gather like just now, fellow Daoist needs to be careful."</p><p></p><p>"If you are inadvertently tainted with the mark, I'm afraid it will take a lot of energy to remove it. It may even affect your future Dao..."</p><p></p><p>Chuanfa reminded.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor was pensive, looking at the True Immortal remnant power around him that had dispersed after a big disturbance but had not disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Is there really no way to truly eliminate these forces? Other than relying on the revival power of the starry sea itself." The Holy Emperor asked.</p><p></p><p>"Does fellow Daoist know why my progress in repairing the Xuanhuang Realm is so slow?"</p><p></p><p>"To expel the True Immortal remnant power that has not become True Immortal..." Chuanfa shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor was silent.</p><p></p><p>"The time left for me is actually not much either." Chuanfa suddenly said this sentence.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor felt a burst of surprise and couldn't help but look at Chuanfa.</p><p></p><p>However, Chuanfa did not explain, but changed the subject and said, "Fellow Daoist, what are your plans now?"</p><p></p><p>"Continue to pursue the Xuan Immortal Boat and find the real culprit behind the scenes..."</p><p></p><p>"Or fight me?!"</p><p></p><p>"Just now, the Xuan Immortal Boat must have sent a message to tell you something, right?" Chuanfa naturally saw the reason for the change in the Holy Emperor's attitude.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor did not hide it and nodded, asking, "Has fellow Daoist ever been to the Xuan Immortal Boat..."</p><p></p><p>"That's right. I also took away some things I needed." Chuanfa admitted frankly.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Holy Emperor couldn't help but stare at this Chuanfa Tianzun.</p><p></p><p>The frankness of this Tianzun was a bit beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>"Just like you want to save Xuanhuang, I also have things I must persist in." Perhaps because he hadn't talked to anyone for a long time, Chuanfa started chatting as if he was talking to an old friend.</p><p></p><p>"To achieve this goal, one must resort to unscrupulous means."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor neither agreed nor disagreed.</p><p></p><p>Chuanfa pointed to the faintly glowing Xuanhuang Realm not far away, at an upward angle: "Fellow Daoist, have you ever been to the Immortal Ruins to take a look?"</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"There sits an enlightened True Immortal. He is one of the main culprits that caused the calamity in this starry sea. Have you ever thought about how to escape from this True Immortal's hands in the future, even if you defeat me?" Chuanfa asked.</p><p></p><p>"The time left for the Xuanhuang Realm is not much either." Chuanfa sneered.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor just remained silent again.</p><p></p><p>"I have a way." Chuanfa said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"For the sake of the two characters 'Xuanhuang', ignoring the possible extinction in the future. How can this be worthy of the character 'Holy'?" Chuanfa asked.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor was not shaken by Chuanfa's words: "If you can find a way to save the world, naturally I can too."</p><p></p><p>"But if I am persuaded by you like this and give up, how can I face the billions of people in the Holy Dynasty?"</p><p></p><p>He just sighed slightly: "Fellow Daoist doesn't know what I've been through over the years..."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Chuanfa said solemnly, "I have no intention of being an enemy with fellow Daoist. I'm also not afraid of you stalling for time."</p><p></p><p>"If fellow Daoist wants to fight, I'm ready anytime."</p><p></p><p>"Everything depends on fellow Daoist's decision."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor listened to Chuanfa's words and pondered for a long time. Just as he was about to speak.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, ripples rose in the surrounding space again.</p><p></p><p>It was the Xuan Immortal Boat, returning after leaving!</p><p></p><p>This time, it didn't directly greet with True Immortal seal characters, but first sarcastically said, "As expected of the famous Chuanfa Tianzun, you really sing better than you talk. Just don't know when those secret treasures you stole from our Xuan Immortal Boat can be returned?"</p><p></p><p>"By the way, the current Xuanhuang Realm being able to exist safely under the Immortal Ruins for so long, our secret treasures also played a part, right!"</p><p></p><p>The voice coming from the Xuan Immortal Boat was full of hatred towards Chuanfa.</p><p></p><p>Chuanfa did not refute.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor, listening to these words, began to ponder what exactly were the so-called secret treasures stolen by Chuanfa.</p><p></p><p>The two supreme beings and an ancient immortal boat confronted each other in the void like this.</p><p></p><p>The conflict between Chuanfa and the Holy Emperor was almost irreconcilable due to the contradiction between Chuanfa's foundation and the survival of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>And between the immortal boat and Chuanfa, it was a worldly feud that could not be resolved either.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, it would be wise for the Holy Emperor to join hands with the immortal boat to deal with Chuanfa together.</p><p></p><p>However, the secret technique that guided the blood relationship before pointed to the Xuan Immortal Boat, making the Holy Emperor feel inexplicably uneasy, so he had not made a decision.</p><p></p><p>It was not entirely relying on Chuanfa's secret technique. The Holy Emperor himself also sensed a bit of familiar aura from that immortal boat.</p><p></p><p>If the Xuan Immortal Boat came from below the high wall, why was it related to his own origin?</p><p></p><p>All of this was too confusing, and what Chuanfa said just now also made the Holy Emperor, who had simply wanted to defeat Chuanfa before, consider more.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Gan chose this location well. If it were a bit further away, even with the protection of the power of True Immortal seal characters, it would be a bit difficult for your immortal boat to preserve itself." After a moment, Chuanfa recognized the voice on the Xuan Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>He said lightly, a cold glint flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>However, he seemed to be wary of something and did not easily take action.</p><p></p><p>But the Xuan Immortal Boat did not pay attention to Chuanfa and openly persuaded the Holy Emperor to cooperate with them.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, take a look..."</p><p></p><p>A large number of images were transmitted into the Holy Emperor's mind.</p><p></p><p>On the land of the Xuanhuang Realm, countless towering obelisks sprayed out dazzling light upwards.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Realm was thus slowly pushed away from the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor even recognized that the driving force behind these obelisks was the Dark Sea hidden deep within the Xuanhuang Realm!</p><p></p><p>"It seems..."</p><p></p><p>"Feasible?"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor extrapolated a little, and his heart was shaken beyond words.</p><p></p><p>"How does this Xuan Immortal Boat know about the existence of the Dark Sea?"</p><p></p><p>As if seeing the question in the Holy Emperor's heart, the Xuan Immortal Boat took the initiative to explain: "Many years ago, our Xuan Immortal Boat came to the Xuanhuang Realm. We had a lot of exchanges..."</p><p></p><p>However, these words did not dispel the Holy Emperor's doubts.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he became even more vigilant.</p><p></p><p>And listening to the Xuan Immortal Boat's words persuading the Holy Emperor, Chuanfa originally didn't take it seriously.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the Holy Emperor's expression changed slightly, which also made him very surprised.</p><p></p><p>His gaze towards the Xuan Immortal Boat also changed again.</p><p></p><p>During this period, too many things happened that puzzled him and were beyond his control.</p><p></p><p>This had never happened in the past thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>But Chuanfa believed that as long as he captured the Xuan Immortal Boat, many questions could be solved.</p><p></p><p>Although considering the factors of the Xuanhuang Realm and that enlightened True Immortal, it was not suitable to take action here.</p><p></p><p>But Chuanfa did not believe that the Xuan Immortal Boat could stay here all the time.</p><p></p><p>Chuanfa's gaze looked into the depths of the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>There, an aura was rushing towards this place at a fast speed.</p><p></p><p>"When He arrives, even if a battle starts here, it won't matter."</p><p></p><p>Chuanfa stared at the Holy Emperor and Xuan Immortal Boat who were communicating, and then slightly closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a wave of fluctuations from the Xuanhuang Realm attracted the attention of the three forces present.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Realm, which had become a bit weak due to remotely supporting the Holy Emperor's power, now actually had a large amount of vitality surging.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>The sound of a violently beating heart was clearly audible.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang light sphere kept churning.</p><p></p><p>As if something was gestating inside.</p><p></p><p>The Xuan Immortal Boat was at a loss.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's face showed some surprise. He felt that the connection from the Xuanhuang Realm was rapidly fading. Although the feelings were still there, from now on, it could no longer provide any assistance.</p><p></p><p>Chuanfa's face first showed bewilderment, and at the same time, there was also a hint of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Then, as if sensing something, a burst of brilliance exploded in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He actually no longer cared about the two people present, and flew straight towards the Xuanhuang Realm at a rapid speed.</p><p></p><p>The Xuan Immortal Boat also reacted after a moment.</p><p></p><p>The tone was horrified, and then overjoyed: "Immortal spirit energy!

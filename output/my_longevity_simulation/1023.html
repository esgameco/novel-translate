            <p>Chapter 1021: True as One Outside the Dream</p><p></p><p>"As for those other disciples with average talent..." </p><p></p><p>A trace of reluctance flashed through Liu Ruchen's eyes, but in the end, he still said in a deep voice, "Then let's abolish their cultivation methods and have them switch to cultivating the Cangsheng Lingyuan Technique!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan clapped his hands in satisfaction. </p><p></p><p>"Sect Master Liu's enlightenment is indeed high. This saves me from a difficult situation."</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruchen gave an embarrassed, bitter smile.  </p><p></p><p>After submitting the list of all the cultivators inside the cauldron, Li Fan decided to awaken the Harmonious Dao elders first after reviewing it.</p><p></p><p>After all, below the Harmonious Dao stage, especially for ancient law cultivators, their use was not very significant.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Medicine King Cauldron, there were six Harmonious Dao and twenty-three Primordial Spirit cultivators in slumber.</p><p></p><p>Among them, Li Fan was already very familiar with Liu San, Fang Zaiji, and Jiang Yushan.  </p><p></p><p>Naturally, in this life, he chose to wake them up first.</p><p></p><p>"Resisting that formless killing intent, perhaps the power of elixirs can be used." Before undoing the Great Dream of Spring and Autumn formation, Liu Ruchen suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>"But I haven't personally experienced it after all, so I'm not completely certain." Liu Ruchen spoke very cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"No matter, it's best if it works."</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruchen took out several elixirs emitting a cold blue light from the Medicine King Cauldron and first fed them to Liu San.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Liu San slowly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The first thing he saw was the unfamiliar Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Who?" Liu San's alertness was still very high as his figure flashed to retreat.</p><p></p><p>However, after seeing Liu Ruchen, the wariness in his heart completely disappeared. </p><p></p><p>"Master..."</p><p></p><p>"Have we already arrived in the Xiaoyao Realm?" A trace of joy appeared on Liu San's face as he subconsciously asked.</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruchen sighed and shook his head, briefly recounting the whole story.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Liu San was also inevitably shocked, but with Liu Ruchen as the backbone, he quickly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Next, they awakened Jiang Yushan.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, Jiang Yushan's reaction was much calmer. </p><p></p><p>She quickly adapted to the new situation a thousand years later.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master Liu, you can make the decisions." Jiang Yushan said indifferently in her metallic, grating voice.</p><p></p><p>"You two, circulate the Jishi Changsheng Scripture for now." Looking at the two cultivators before him, Liu Ruchen instructed.</p><p></p><p>Liu San and Jiang Yushan immediately complied.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, the two simultaneously furrowed their brows.  </p><p></p><p>"There is indeed a vexing killing intent surging from time to time. But it can still be controlled. Perhaps it's the effect of that [Wushi Dan]." After comprehending for a moment, Liu San replied.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan said, "The Wushi Dan was wasted on me. Compared to what I encountered in Wuding Prison, it's not worth mentioning at all."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Liu Ruchen finally looked at Li Fan, "It seems it indeed has the effect of suppressing the killing intent. However, the materials needed to refine Wushi Dan are quite precious, I'm afraid the stock in the Medicine King Cauldron is only enough to refine a few batches..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan waved his hand, "Don't worry about the issue of raw materials, our Myriad Realms United Association is quite wealthy in this regard."</p><p></p><p>"Continue, let's see how many it can sustain at most."</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruchen nodded.</p><p></p><p>Next, they successively awakened two more Harmonious Dao cultivators, Ceng Qianran and Ou Kui.</p><p></p><p>At this point, their suppression of the killing intent in their hearts was already very strained.  </p><p></p><p>"It seems this is the limit. Let's stop here for now, as for the remaining Fan Zhuo..."</p><p></p><p>"There's also one Elder Fang, his situation is a bit special. He didn't cultivate the Jishi Changsheng Scripture, so it's fine to wake him up." Before Li Fan finished speaking, Jiang Yushan</p><p></p><p>Sure, here's the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>He spoke up to remind them.</p><p></p><p>Liu San glanced slightly at Jiang Yushan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled, and finally released Fang Zaiji from the Dameng Chunqiu Formation.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the top combat power of the Medicine King Sect was basically gathered.</p><p></p><p>Including Liu Ruchen himself, there were six Hedao cultivators. Even for the ancient law, it was a considerable force for the current Wanjie Alliance.</p><p></p><p>In addition, they were all specialized in alchemy, and their role might be even greater than ordinary Hedao cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Under the leadership of Liu Ruchen, the Medicine King Sect members familiarized themselves with the basic situation of the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>All of them were heavy-hearted, except for Fang Zaiji.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji heard that there were even cultivators from the Tianji Realm in the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>And after learning that Liu Ruchen's body was a puppet refined by the other party, he was immediately overjoyed and kept clamoring to meet the Ingenious Daoist.</p><p></p><p>The Ingenious Daoist, who was immersed in studying Tianyang, was originally a little unwelcoming to this uninvited guest.</p><p></p><p>However, after a brief exchange, the two immediately got along very well.</p><p></p><p>Although Fang Zaiji's level of artifact refining was far inferior to the Ingenious Daoist, he had traveled all over the Xuanhuang Realm when he was young and had extraordinary knowledge.</p><p></p><p>He could also help with the research on Tianyang's body transformation Dao.</p><p></p><p>The two of them excitedly closed the door, not allowing outsiders to disturb them.</p><p></p><p>After a discussion among the several Hedao cultivators of the Medicine King Sect, they finally gave Li Fan a list of thirty people.</p><p></p><p>"These disciples are all absolutely talented. If they convert to cultivate the Cangsheng Lingyuan Gong, it would be a bit of a pity. Let them remain in slumber for now, and we'll find a way to suppress the killing intent later."</p><p></p><p>"As for the other disciples..." Liu Ruchen said resolutely, "Leave them to the envoy to handle."</p><p></p><p>Although it was ruthless and merciless, at least their lives could be spared.</p><p></p><p>As for gathering the power of the several Hedao cultivators to turn against them...</p><p></p><p>After witnessing the many scenes in the Lingmu Realm, they decisively suppressed this idea deep in their minds, not daring to reveal the slightest bit.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I have another way. It's not necessary to turn all these disciples into valueless puppets for operating techniques," Li Fan suddenly spoke up, looking at the Medicine King Sect members.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't they currently sleeping in the Dameng Chunqiu Formation? If I modify the formation so that the situation in the dream aligns with reality..."</p><p></p><p>"They don't necessarily have to wake up and can complete the required work in reality."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Liu Ruchen said with some uncertainty, "Envoy, you mean..."</p><p></p><p>"Sleepwalking?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>The Terminal Dissociation Disk in his sea of consciousness operated, and the modified Dameng Chunqiu Formation instantly appeared.</p><p></p><p>After imparting the formation to Liu Ruchen, the latter's eyes were filled with astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Because this formation seemed to have been derived in just a moment of speaking?</p><p></p><p>"It should work," Liu Ruchen took a deep breath and said slowly.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, when the new Dameng Chunqiu Formation replaced the operation, Li Fan and his group appeared in the dream realm of the Medicine King Sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>The original scenes in the dream realm had all disappeared, replaced by a scene identical to the Lingmu Realm in reality.</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruchen did not tell the disciples that they were still in a dream realm.</p><p></p><p>He only recounted the events of their failed escape from the Xuanhuang Realm and their current refuge in the Wanjie Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Although the disciples were in a state of panic, they at least had their lives spared.</p><p></p><p>After some commotion, they returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>Following Liu Ruchen's instructions, they settled down in the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in reality, their bodies also exhibited synchronized movements.</p>

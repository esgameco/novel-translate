        <h1>Chapter 972</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate has been enlightened for many years, and his strength is truly unfathomable. It's best not to underestimate him," the young man who appeared quite shy quickly regained his composure after being startled. With a light cough, he kindly reminded.</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention a million cultivators, even if all the cultivators in the entire Xuanhuang Realm were to join forces, they might not necessarily be able to defeat the Dharma Transmission Venerate."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm..." </p><p></p><p>"There is some truth to that. After all, he is an existence that has dominated the entire Xuanhuang Realm for thousands of years..."</p><p></p><p>Seemingly convinced by the young man's words, the arrogance on Li Fan's face disappeared and gradually turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>"But there's no need to be overly afraid of him either."</p><p></p><p>"If he really pushes me to the brink, I'll just trigger the Starving Immortal in the Immortal Ruins at worst, and we'll perish together!"</p><p></p><p>To the young man's surprise, after only a moment of calmness, Li Fan's tone turned cold as he spoke, contrary to expectations.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the content of his words caused the Dharma Transmitter's complexion to change drastically.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Realm, very few cultivators knew about the existence of the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>And even fewer cultivators knew that a True Immortal was entombed in the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't sure about the Five Elders, but at least among the many Dharma Transmitters of the Myriad Immortal Alliance, only he alone was aware of this matter.</p><p></p><p>It was the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate himself who had personally told him back then.</p><p></p><p>And now...</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Jiang stared at the unremarkable cultivator before him, his thoughts rapidly turning as he speculated about the other party's background.</p><p></p><p>"One who can know such a secret must have had contact with forces above the Eternal Life Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Heaven Secret Technique, a legacy from the Immortal Realm. It must be the remnants of the Mysterious Heaven Sect, no mistake."</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought that after so long, the Mysterious Heaven Sect still refuses to disperse? And there's even a possibility that they have infiltrated the upper echelons of the Immortal Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>As he pondered, Dharma Transmitter Jiang tried to guide Li Fan: "Unless there's no other choice, it's best not to opt for mutual destruction."</p><p></p><p>"After all, it hasn't been easy to reach the current situation. Wouldn't it be a pity to give it up so easily?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also nodded in agreement: "Indeed, abandoning the plans of more than seven years in this life would be somewhat regrettable."</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Jiang was shocked once again: "More than seven years of planning for this matter?"</p><p></p><p>"Only seven years?"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible?!"</p><p></p><p>"When did our Myriad Immortal Alliance become so easily infiltrated?"</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Jiang was both furious and once again began to size up the Mysterious Heaven Sect cultivator before him.</p><p></p><p>"Or could it be that he is deliberately pretending to deceive me?"</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Jiang couldn't help but think.</p><p></p><p>However, after observing for a while, Dharma Transmitter Jiang secretly shook his head, denying his own speculation.</p><p></p><p>Any living being that came into face-to-face contact with him would perceive him as "themselves".</p><p></p><p>Wariness, secrets, defensesâ€”all these emotions that only arise towards others would not emerge when facing Dharma Transmitter Jiang.</p><p></p><p>If their life was threatened, they would instinctively protect their own life, just as they would safeguard his well-being.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the thousands of years in the Xuanhuang Realm, Dharma Transmitter Jiang had never encountered an existence immune to this characteristic.</p><p></p><p>Even the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate back then was no exception!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could he have relied on unremarkable strength and talent to securely hold the position of the number one Dharma Transmitter?</p><p></p><p>This ability was indeed extremely formidable. For him, no enemies existed in the world. If he wished, he could even glimpse the secrets of all others, one by one.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If there was any flaw, it would be that it was only at the level of "like me".</p><p></p><p>Not "for me".</p><p></p><p>Indeed, almost all living beings would not have any guard against "themselves".</p><p></p><p>But if they doubted the authenticity of this "me" played by Jiang, the Dharma transmitter, they would similarly launch an attack on him.</p><p></p><p>Back then, the Dharma Transmitting Heavenly Venerate saw through him in this way.</p><p></p><p>So he could only slowly inquire through various methods. If he directly asked about things that the "original self" regarded as common sense, he might be seen through.</p><p></p><p>Although there was such a limitation, over the years, relying on this heaven-defying characteristic, he remained invincible. Cultivators who could truly see through him were no more than a handful.</p><p></p><p>The other Dharma transmitters knew about this ability of his. Even if they were on guard, they simply could not resist.</p><p></p><p>They could only respect him from a distance.</p><p></p><p>And for the sake of the overall order of the Dharma transmitter group, he also exiled himself to a blank small world of "Gui Xu". Remotely controlling many affairs of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator in front of him, although unfathomable, obviously did not escape the influence of his innate characteristics.</p><p></p><p>"What he said should all be true."</p><p></p><p>Jiang, the Dharma transmitter, not only did not breathe a sigh of relief after making such a judgment, but became even more heavy-hearted.</p><p></p><p>"Seven years, seven years..."</p><p></p><p>Jiang quickly screened through all the big and small events that occurred in the Myriad Immortals Alliance in the past seven years, trying to find the mole named Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>But the other party had obviously changed his name, and there was no clue at all.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that we still have to find a way from this person."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it doesn't matter. With 'Huan Zhen' in hand, as long as it is realized once, it can be reproduced countless times..." Li Fan was talking confidently, when suddenly his words abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>He stared at Jiang, his expression seeming not to change in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>But Jiang keenly sensed that the surrounding atmosphere was a bit different!</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Where did I reveal a flaw?"</p><p></p><p>"With 'Huan Zhen' in hand, one can reproduce the previously realized scheme countless times?"</p><p></p><p>"What kind of treasure is 'Huan Zhen'?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be an immortal artifact left behind by the Xuantian Sect back then?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless thoughts flashed through Jiang's mind.</p><p></p><p>But he also understood that he seemed to be exposed, so he simply didn't hide it. While his innate nature was still in effect, he tried to ask: "What is 'Huan Zhen'?"</p><p></p><p>"What is 'Huan Zhen'?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>This sentence kept echoing in Li Fan's sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>A gaze that did not contain any emotion locked onto Jiang.</p><p></p><p>And then, the millions of demons that were originally rampaging and wantonly destroying in the Xuanhuang Realm all returned in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Evil energy surged to the sky, and ghosts and demons returned!</p><p></p><p>Jiang's face slightly changed, wanting to break the connection and leave this sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>But it was already too late.</p><p></p><p>The millions of demons all let out earth-shattering roars at Jiang.</p><p></p><p>The howling sounds gathered together like overwhelming waves.</p><p></p><p>With the momentum to destroy everything, it pressed down on Jiang's head!</p><p></p><p>And under the cover of the offensive from the millions of demons, a subtle, inconspicuous seven-colored divine light also took the opportunity to fly out.</p><p></p><p>It collided with Jiang's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The moment they touched, the seven-colored divine light quietly dissolved, injecting a wisp of gray mold into Jiang's consciousness.</p>

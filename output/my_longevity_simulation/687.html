        <h1>Chapter 687</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Beside him, countless tiny tornadoes could be vaguely seen swirling. In the center of the whirlwind, it was pitch black, as if space itself had been torn apart.</p><p></p><p>The burly man drifted with the wind. The miniature tornadoes also appeared and disappeared in sync with his movements.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, still some distance away from the center of the vortex, had already been swept by the surrounding torrents of wind, causing him discomfort. But the burly man at the core did not take any protective measures, allowing the violent gales to blow against him, emitting the crisp sound of metal collision.</p><p></p><p>"He is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Although this was the first time they met in this life, in the previous life Li Fan had a brief encounter with him. It was Dongfang Yao, who oversaw the construction of the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Array in the Wanli Yan Burnt Marsh and Hualing Ravine. This person had a close relationship with Emperor Fu Song and was already at the Divine Transformation stage at that time.</p><p></p><p>However, now it seemed that he had not crossed that threshold and was still within the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, without spiritual energy fluctuations, he can resist the torrents solely with his robust physical body. I remember that the body refining techniques in the Xuanhuang Realm should progress very slowly due to the constraints of the heavens and earth at a certain stage of cultivation. I wonder how he has refined himself to this extent..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not rush forward but observed Dongfang Yao's enlightenment from a distance.</p><p></p><p>The fierce wind raged, and the flow of water in the vortex became increasingly turbulent. Dongfang Yao tried to stabilize his posture in the storm and move towards the center of the vortex. With each step he took, it seemed like the faint sound of his body being compressed by immense pressure could be heard.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Dongfang Yao let out a roar, and his neck veins bulged, his muscles seemingly covered with a faint golden light.</p><p></p><p>Resolutely, he continued to approach the center of the vortex amidst the storm.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a black crack appeared out of nowhere in front of Dongfang Yao, like a sword slashing at him.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!" A deafening, even penetrating roar that could pierce through the wind and rain rang out. A bloodstain appeared on Dongfang Yao's body, and he was forced to step back several paces.</p><p></p><p>However, he was not surprised but delighted.</p><p></p><p>"I have finally met you!"</p><p></p><p>A strange sound emanated from his throat, and in an instant, the seemingly severe wound on Dongfang Yao's body had already healed. Stepping on the emptiness under his feet, his body suddenly burst forward, leaping dozens of zhangs ahead.</p><p></p><p>A huge black crack, seemingly abrupt in appearance, but also seemed to have been hidden since ancient times, suddenly emerged.</p><p></p><p>The black light like a sword fiercely sliced along Dongfang Yao's bodyline.</p><p></p><p>"Thud!"</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao's skin split open, nearly being split open and disemboweled on the spot. He retreated violently, instantly fleeing hundreds of zhangs away, back to the safe periphery of the vortex.</p><p></p><p>"Are you okay, friend?" Seeing the situation, Li Fan timely inquired.</p><p></p><p>Without approaching, he simply tossed a healing pill. It was the "Baiyuedan" specially prepared by Liu San for him on this trip. Although not a life-saving holy medicine that could revive the dead or heal bones, it was still an excellent healing pill. When taken for general wounds, they would heal in a matter of moments...</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao caught the Baiyuedan and swallowed it in one gulp after just a glance.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing! Thanks for your concern, friend!" While saying this, the seemingly severe wounds on his body had already completely healed.</p><p></p><p>Not even a scar remained.</p><p></p><p>This was partly due to the effectiveness of the Baiyuedan, but more so because of Dongfang Yao's exceptionally strong constitution.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but glance sidewards at him.</p><p></p><p>"How should I address you?" Dongfang Yao temporarily halted his cultivation amidst the storm and flew over to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"I am Li Fan. I've heard about the wonders of the Great Vortex in the Nether Ruins, so I passed by to take a look. I didn't expect to encounter such a remarkable person like you!" Li Fan's gaze swept over the distinct muscle lines on Dongfang Yao's body, showing a hint of admiration in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I am Dongfang Yao!" He waved his hand. "Nothing remarkable, just a bit stronger in physique!"</p><p></p><p>"Dongfang friend, you are too modest. With such a robust physical body, you are probably even better than the mythical body cultivators from ancient times, aren't you?" Li Fan marveled in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao laughed heartily, "I like hearing that..."</p><p></p><p>He was about to say more but suddenly turned back and looked towards the center of the vortex.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the sounds of wind and thunder, it seemed that another black shadow was emerging.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, wait a moment. I will be right back!" </p><p></p><p>With his voice echoing through the air, he dashed towards the center like lightning.</p><p></p><p>The resounding roars and collisions echoed once again.</p><p></p><p>After a few breaths, Dongfang Yao, now covered in blood and looking rather bedraggled, returned to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>This time, Li Fan did not take out another Baiyuedan but silently watched as Dongfang Yao self-healed.</p><p></p><p>The injuries were worse than before, but with just a little more effort, he had fully recovered.</p><p></p><p>"I worried for nothing, and I even wasted a good pill!" Li Fan, dumbfounded by the sight, deliberately commented.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, it wasn't a waste! It's still hidden in my stomach." Dongfang Yao patted his belly with some pride, smiling.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was stunned for a moment, then shook his head and said with a bitter smile, "Friend, you are truly extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao smiled without responding.</p><p></p><p>"To be able to stay here near the ancient vortex for so long without any change in expression, Li Friend, you are also quite remarkable!" After a while, he looked deeply at Li Fan, hinting at something.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan showed a somewhat helpless expression on his face. "The Xuanhuang Realm is full of crises, without some means, I dare not wander around freely. However, it's just some quick recovery techniques for spiritual energy, nothing compared to your abilities, friend."</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that body refinement techniques are extremely difficult, and friend, to achieve this level, you can be considered a peerless talent!" Li Fan admired him.</p><p></p><p>Although Dongfang Yao modestly praised him, he could not hide his inner satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that my constitution is naturally a bit special."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, the black crack in the center of the vortex reappeared, interrupting their conversation as Dongfang Yao headed back inside.</p><p></p><p>When he returned from the severe injuries, they conversed again.</p><p></p><p>In this way, Li Fan gradually learned some insider information from Dongfang Yao's words.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that Dongfang Yao, like Ye Feipeng, had a trace of ancient monster bloodline running within him.</p><p></p><p>Although after thousands of years, the dilution of this bloodline was almost negligible, in a miraculous encounter, Dongfang Yao had managed to fully tap into the potential of his monster bloodline.</p>

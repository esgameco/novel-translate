            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>To escape from the sinking ship that is the Xuanhuang Realm, having the necessary technical reserves is naturally indispensable. Relying on Li Fan alone is obviously not enough to achieve this step.</p><p></p><p>Only by learning from the existing achievements of the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders Council, and then innovating on their foundation, is there a possibility of breaking the situation.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how the Immortal Selection plan is progressing."</p><p></p><p>"Even if the Wanxian Alliance had ill intentions from the beginning, before the truth is revealed, they are still the much-watched Immortal Selectees, the stars of hope for the Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"They should be able to play some role as internal response."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Fan replied to the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>He did not reveal the existence of Senior Shiban, only claiming that he received an urgent notice that there was a risk of exposure for this meeting, so he was forced to cancel it.</p><p></p><p>As for the problem, it must be on the Five Elders Council's side.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also told them to investigate thoroughly, as they must have been infiltrated by spies from the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Although he made it up on the spot, Li Fan didn't care.</p><p></p><p>As for spies, as long as you investigate, there will always be some.</p><p></p><p>Putting aside the matter of the Five Elders Council for now, Li Fan calmed his mind and focused his consciousness on the Five Elements Primordial Cave inside his body. </p><p></p><p>Previously, he thought that this Five Elements Cave was naturally evolved from the Xuanhuang Realm and naturally fearless.</p><p></p><p>But now through Senior Shiban, he learned that this was the handiwork of the "One Beginning Sect" thousands of years ago...</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's careful and cautious personality, he definitely had to carefully inspect it again.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, it was just Li Fan's false alarm.</p><p></p><p>After serious identification, inside the Five Elements Great Cave, there were no remnant marks left by the One Beginning Sect back then.</p><p></p><p>This made Li Fan slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Xuanhuang Realm is perilous, and any slight possible threat must be treated with caution.</p><p></p><p>"With the Nascent Soul formed, the next step is to look towards Deity Transformation."</p><p></p><p>"The heaven and earth's impending change..."</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's mind, he instantly recalled the scenes of Mr. Bai traveling around Xuanhuang in the 115th lifetime, integrating the changes of Xuanhuang into his own cave.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to Mr. Bai, Li Fan is well aware of the vast majority of the "impending changes" available in Xuanhuang within a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>"With the 'Sitting Immortal Jue', plus the continuous feedback on cultivation from members of the Myriad Realms United Association, I hardly need to worry about the accumulation process of cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"The only thing worth worrying about is the existence of the Heavenly Tribulation. And how exactly can several different impending changes be harmoniously accommodated."</p><p></p><p>After achieving the Nascent Soul with the Five Elements Great Cave, ordinary Deity Transformation methods are no longer in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Even the general Aura of Heaven and Earth, Li Fan lacks interest in.</p><p></p><p>Too weak!</p><p></p><p>It's not that Li Fan's mentality has inflated.</p><p></p><p>Although he has not exerted his full strength so far, the vast power from the Five Elements Cave inside his body has made him far surpass the scope of ordinary Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p></p><p>When he was in the Foundation Establishment stage, he could already rely on various means to fight Nascent Soul cultivators to mutual destruction.</p><p></p><p>Now that his strength has expanded who knows how many times, crushing ordinary Nascent Souls is not much more difficult than crushing an ant.</p><p></p><p>Plus, he also has the Five Elements Annihilation Sword, Seven-Colored Jade Void Flowing Light, and even the "Chaos" Jue on him.</p><p></p><p>Auras of Heaven and Earth like Crimson Flame and Black Marsh are definitely not his match either.</p><p></p><p>Only existences at the level of Ink Killer would make Li Fan feel slightly tricky.</p><p></p><p>But there should be no big problem in retreating unscathed before them.</p><p></p><p>The Nascent Soul is already like</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this point, how could Li Fan be content with taking the ordinary path of Hua Shen and He Dao?</p><p></p><p>Like Mr. Bai, he wanted to embrace all the changes of the Xuanhuang world within himself.</p><p></p><p>He would transform his Yuanying Dongtian into an inner world.</p><p></p><p>Then, he would deceive and seize the souls of various worlds, greatly stealing the original power of the Xuanhuang world.</p><p></p><p>This was the most ideal method for expanding one's strength.</p><p></p><p>For now, let's not consider whether doing so could make him a match for the Chuanfa.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan believed that if he could really achieve that level, he would at least not be at a disadvantage when facing ordinary Changsheng Tian Zun.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, if I can really find a way to escape the Xuanhuang realm, with my cultivation in other immortal realms, I will absolutely dominate among those of the same level."</p><p></p><p>Cultivators of the Xuanhuang realm devoured heaven and earth. They were naturally a few times more powerful than conventional cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan wanted to surpass ordinary cultivators of the new method by many times more.</p><p></p><p>Comparing the two, he would absolutely crush them.</p><p></p><p>However, although the ideal was good, a problem stood in front of Li Fan, urgently needing to be solved.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai was the embodiment of the will of the Heavenly Dao. Taking the changes of heaven and earth's birth and the souls of heaven and earth was like using his own things.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, he would not encounter any resistance.</p><p></p><p>But who was Li Fan?</p><p></p><p>Why would the Heavenly Dao of the Xuanhuang realm allow him to do this?</p><p></p><p>Ordinary cultivators practicing the new method had already incurred the jealousy and hatred of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>They were simply mortal enemies of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>In a situation where heaven and earth were both enemies, how could he make the changes of birth and the souls of heaven and earth his own?</p><p></p><p>Even if he could forcibly absorb one or two, a rebellion would be the inevitable result.</p><p></p><p>"Unless..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>For the knowledgeable and experienced Li Taishi, this was not an unsolvable problem. Almost instantly, he thought of a countermeasure.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao hated cultivators so much was simply that cultivators had to seize resources from the Xuanhuang realm in order to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>As long as this point did not change, there was no possibility of easing the contradiction between the two sides.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Xuanhuang realm was at an absolute disadvantage in the struggle.</p><p></p><p>This gave Li Fan a possible glimmer of opportunity.</p><p></p><p>That was to re-choose sides and stand on the side of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan vaguely remembered that when he brought Qian Hong's remains back to the Xuanhuang realm from the Great Xuan,</p><p></p><p>The phenomenon of falling, which should have appeared once at the time of death, appeared again for no reason.</p><p></p><p>And after doing all this, Li Fan only felt that something special seemed to have happened to him.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he didn't quite understand the significance of it.</p><p></p><p>But after so many years of browsing the secret scriptures of the immortal realm, Li Fan already knew the reason for this.</p><p></p><p>Although such things were rare in the Xuanhuang realm, they had happened before.</p><p></p><p>There were cultivators who, although forced to practice the new method due to changes in the laws of heaven and earth, were overall beneficial to heaven and earth in their careers.</p><p></p><p>For example...</p><p></p><p>Helping to slaughter cultivators of the new method and accelerating the process of returning the Dao to heaven.</p><p></p><p>Although in the eyes of cultivators, such people were undoubtedly demonic cultivators and were targets of severe crackdowns within both the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders Council,</p><p></p><p>But in the eyes of heaven and earth, they were indeed good people.</p><p></p><p>Good cultivators who stood on the side of heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just an extreme example. In addition to slaughtering cultivators, filling the gaps in heaven and earth, or helping the souls of heaven and earth complete their heavenly duties...</p><p></p><p>These could all increase the favorability of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>When the favorability reached a certain level, although heaven and earth would still send down phenomena when the cultivator fell,</p>

        <h1>Chapter 976</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Upon entering the small world of a Dharma Transmitter, cultivators can also enjoy the characteristic of not aging. Even Feng, the Dharma Transmitter least enthusiastic about collecting talents - that is, the body I occupy - has over a thousand true geniuses in his small world."</p><p></p><p>"It's conceivable how deep the foundations of the other Dharma Transmitters are."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a scene couldn't help but appear in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Realm was like a field, and over the thousands of years, the cultivators were like the crops in the field, growing one batch after another.</p><p></p><p>The ordinary ones were harvested, while the true essence was carefully preserved by those Dharma Transmitters.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the hidden cards of the Wanxian Alliance seem endless, bringing me surprises in every lifetime."</p><p></p><p>"This is just from the Dharma Transmitter lineage. The Alliance also has the Mirror Holders and the Huan Zhen Sages, two lineages on par with them..."</p><p></p><p>"In comparison, the Five Elders Association seems a bit..."</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was thinking this, he snorted coldly, "Treating the cultivators of the world like this, they really deserve to be killed!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin also nodded, indicating his agreement, "If the Xuantian King returns, he must purge them all!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't echo this, but pretended to fall into confusion, "Xuantian King, Xuantian King..."</p><p></p><p>"Such a familiar name..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan getting confused again, Mo Rubin felt a bit helpless.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately it's only intermittent and doesn't affect major matters."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Mo Rubin painstakingly "woke up" Li Fan again and explained related matters in case there were further developments.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he leave Li Fan's mental space.</p><p></p><p>A long time later, Li Fan finally recovered from his pretense. </p><p></p><p>"Dharma Transmitter Jiang should have returned to the origin along with the gray mold. No wonder the attack never came, looks like the danger has passed."</p><p></p><p>"However, Dharma Transmitter Jiang's nature seems to have been transformed from a magic treasure left behind in the Xuanhuang Realm. There's no good way to guard against it at the moment. Even if known in advance, its influence can't be immunized against..."</p><p></p><p>Even though Li Fan had the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra protecting his body, Dharma Transmitter Jiang's nature seemed to directly change his own attributes and properties.</p><p></p><p>Rather than causing confusion in others' minds and perceptions, it never triggered the protective effect of the Immortal Heart Mantra from beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>"Before the great calamity back then, all the magic treasures in the Xuanhuang Realm suddenly went missing. Who would have thought some were even transformed into people."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting..."</p><p></p><p>Since he really wasn't exposed, there was no need to reveal the truth.</p><p></p><p>The plan for this lifetime had to continue.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan didn't let his guard down, his mind still didn't disconnect from the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps that Dharma Transmitter Jiang was deceiving even his own people, and this was his strategy of misdirection?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan decided to wait and see.</p><p></p><p>What needed to be done now was summed up in one word: wait.</p><p></p><p>His alter ego "Sun Xingwang" and Mo Rubin were both not good at formations, and the group from the Wanxian Alliance's Strategy Formation Hall might not be truly reliable either.</p><p></p><p>So external help was needed.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps considering the need to repair the [Floating Crossing Starry Sky Grand Formation] in the future, Mo Rubin only pondered for a moment before feeling Li Fan's words made sense.</p><p></p><p>He agreed to look for some exotic treasure that could extrapolate formations after returning.</p><p></p><p>"If I can absorb the Separation Disk of the Nine Disks Combined Into One again, my formation extrapolation ability will usher in another...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"By then, I'm afraid I will be able to easily decipher that [Reverse Life and Death Grand Formation]. Perhaps then I will be able to find the true identity of that Life and Death Celestial Venerable."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's plan to sit still in the Spirit Wood Realm was forcibly terminated half a month later by a sudden message from Lin Ling. </p><p></p><p>Even though she was already a Harmonious Dao powerhouse, Lin Ling's tone was as panicked as a child's: "Ma...Master, Elder...Elder Stone Tablet has disappeared!"</p><p></p><p>"That small pond also disappeared along with him!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was shocked and got up abruptly. </p><p></p><p>The precious Fishing Pond and Elder Stone Tablet both disappeared? </p><p></p><p>What's going on?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who suddenly became anxious, was about to rush to that small mountain temple.</p><p></p><p>However, when he recalled some of Lin Ling's previous behaviors, Li Fan suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>He solemnly transmitted a message: "What are you panicking about! With Elder Stone Tablet's strength, who in the Primordial World can hurt him?"</p><p></p><p>"Describe the situation at that time in detail."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master." Lin Ling still nervously described the situation when the anomaly occurred.</p><p></p><p>It is said that after Elder Stone Tablet sat cross-legged in the Fishing Pond to comprehend the Dao, he remained as still as a sculpture.</p><p></p><p>Originally, out of respect and fear for Elder Stone Tablet, Lin Ling and the young Daoist Liuli always kept their distance.</p><p></p><p>However, as time passed, they became bolder.</p><p></p><p>After discovering that even if they got very close, it would not cause any reaction from Elder Stone Tablet, they would gather in front of him from time to time.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to take a close look at this strange Elder Stone Tablet.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling was a little scared at first, but after being pulled by the young Daoist Liuli and discovering that nothing would really happen, she went along.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Lin Ling, the closer we are to Elder Stone Tablet, the more benefits we get." The young Daoist Liuli sat on the ground and looked up at Elder Stone Tablet with some greed in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling also felt that near Elder Stone Tablet, there were special Dao rhythm fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be able to resonate with other laws of heaven and earth. After just a moment, many scenes naturally appeared in her mind intermittently. </p><p></p><p>Profound and abstruse, involving different principles of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Even for her, a Harmonious Dao realm cultivator, it was of great benefit.</p><p></p><p>"I only understood later that Elder Stone Tablet had reached the most critical moment in comprehending the Dao of [Fishing]. Therefore, it caused the resonance of the world's laws of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>"But at that time, I was immersed in the benefits of enlightenment and didn't notice."</p><p></p><p>"Until not long ago, that Dao rhythm fluctuation suddenly became turbulent. That feeling..."</p><p></p><p>"It was like the calm water surface suddenly stirred up huge waves!"</p><p></p><p>There was a trace of fear in Lin Ling's tone.</p><p></p><p>"In the Fishing Pond, it seemed that something was pulling hard."</p><p></p><p>"Elder Stone Tablet was suddenly pulled forward a step without any sign."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, the expression on Elder Stone Tablet's face was very strange, with pleasant surprise and fear."</p><p></p><p>"It was as if there was an invisible line tying him to something in the Fishing Pond. They wrestled with each other, neither willing to let go."</p><p></p><p>"Then..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling paused and said in horror, "Suddenly, Elder Stone Tablet disappeared right in front of our eyes, as if he was dragged into the Fishing Pond!"</p><p></p><p>"What's even more terrifying is that we found out afterwards that the Fishing Pond also stopped working."</p>

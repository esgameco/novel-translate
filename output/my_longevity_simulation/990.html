        <div class="content">
            <p>"Oh?" Li Fan looked up at Baihua Daoren.</p><p></p><p>This guy, his words always unexpectedly startled people.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean by different?"</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren slowly explained: "Perhaps you, Commander, are the first person to come into contact with the True Immortal stone statue again, or perhaps the first person to cause the stone statue to 'revive' once more."</p><p></p><p>"In any case, I believe you have also noticed, Commander, that compared to others, you possess a different authority."</p><p></p><p>"This may be a sign that the True Immortal regards you, Commander, differently."</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren tried every means to find reasons to explain.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan just chuckled in response. </p><p></p><p>"Alright, the True Immortal's intentions are not something we can fathom."</p><p></p><p>"I am a person who knows gratitude. Since the True Immortal created me, regardless of the final outcome, I will take it as my duty to restore the True Immortal's Dao lineage."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said with great righteousness, ending the discussion between the two about the True Immortal.</p><p></p><p>"I still don't know what you are good at? Since you've joined our Universal Alliance, we can't let your skills go to waste."</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, our alliance is currently still in the stages of hiding and developing. I also know your actual combat power isn't strong, so I won't let you go to the front lines to fight others." Li Fan asked very considerately. </p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's smiling expression, Baihua Daoren's heart suddenly surged with an ominous premonition for some reason. But she still answered with a stiff upper lip: "Now that I've transformed into a glazed body, there are two things I'm best at."</p><p></p><p>"First, soothing and repairing spiritual consciousness and spiritual soul trauma. But this requires consuming my origin, so I can only do it occasionally."</p><p></p><p>After worshipping the True Immortal stone statue, Baihua Daoren knew that she had already formed a connection with the statue. Li Fan could also sense her emotions through this.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Baihua Daoren didn't dare to conceal anything and honestly confessed: "As for the second, it's nurturing and protecting spiritual plants, herbs and the like. Not only can it make their vitality more abundant, there's also a certain probability of giving birth to a spirit."</p><p></p><p>"However, I've observed that the spiritual energy in this realm has all been absorbed by the central Spirit Tree, so the number of spiritual plants is very scarce."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded: "Not bad, the Spirit Tree Realm is indeed very barren."</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"But it doesn't matter, our alliance has another base that can definitely satisfy Fellow Daoist Baihua's needs."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Baihua Daoren's eyes blurred.</p><p></p><p>When she clearly saw the scene before her eyes, her body couldn't help trembling slightly again.</p><p></p><p>A towering tree, much taller than the Spirit Tree in the Spirit Tree Realm, stood in her field of vision.</p><p></p><p>The giant tree did not absorb all the nourishment between heaven and earth, but formed countless miniature ecosystems around its roots and even on the branches of the Spirit Tree.</p><p></p><p>Countless grasses, spiritual plants, and spiritual medicines filled them.</p><p></p><p>Densely packed, extending all the way to the horizon.</p><p></p><p>Even with her spiritual consciousness, she couldn't see the end in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The extremely thick wood-attributed spiritual energy almost choked Baihua Daoren.</p><p></p><p>"This... where is this?"</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Baihua Daoren finally came back to her senses.</p><p></p><p>Not seeing Li Fan's figure, she looked around and asked.</p><p></p><p>"This is one of the secret bases of the Universal Alliance, the Spirit Tree Grotto-Heaven."</p><p></p><p>"I believe the abundance of spiritual plants here should be enough for Fellow Daoist to manage."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's voice resounded through heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren opened her mouth, wanting to say something but stopping.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy of the wood element is so abundant here, there's no need for her to manage it at all. Just dig up any plant, and it will be a top-grade material!</p><p></p><p>However, sensing the other party's subtle threat, Baihua Daoren could only say bitterly, "Enough, that's enough."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, that's good. Although this cave heaven has slightly more abundant resources, it has been abandoned for too long and appears a bit chaotic. It will still require Daoyou to put in some effort. After all, it will serve as the logistical base for the alliance in the future, so we must be careful." Li Fan said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren looked at the boundless cave heaven and nodded blankly.</p><p></p><p>"To thoroughly manage it, even with my current abilities, it would take at least more than ten years," Baihua Daoren sighed.</p><p></p><p>"This emissary seems to be a smiling tiger."</p><p></p><p>However, with her true body already bound by the True Immortal stone statue and Liuli still under the other party's control, Baihua Daoren could only work hard like a fish on the chopping block.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, she had always enjoyed interacting with these spiritual objects, and this cave heaven had not been disturbed by cultivators for who knows how many years. All the spiritual objects were growing well, making people feel pity upon seeing them.</p><p></p><p>As Baihua Daoren processed the areas one by one, her mood gradually improved.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, her movements were interrupted by a rumbling sound coming from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren looked up and saw a huge piece of land suddenly appear, floating at the waist of the giant tree.</p><p></p><p>Like a dark cloud, it obscured the sky.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's voice came again, "By the way, there are still many spiritual plants in another base. I've moved them all here for you, so you don't have to run back and forth."</p><p></p><p>"If it's convenient, why not transplant all of them into this cave heaven?"</p><p></p><p>After finishing his words, Li Fan's aura disappeared again.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren was stunned for a moment, then flew into the sky and took a look. She almost couldn't catch her breath.</p><p></p><p>She saw that the continent was still covered with spiritual herbs as far as the eye could see.</p><p></p><p>"There are formations categorizing them, and they have all been planted for at least a few thousand years. They can be considered the highest quality..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this emissary has emptied some ancient immortal sect?"</p><p></p><p>"These will be even more troublesome to deal with."</p><p></p><p>"The construction period will have to be extended by another five years?"</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren thought helplessly.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sensed Baihua Daoren in his wood-attributed cave heaven and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Although this Baihua Daoren seemed to have completely submitted, she was still a long-lived cultivator who had been dormant in the outside world for who knows how many years.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan still couldn't fully trust her.</p><p></p><p>Now suppressing her in his own cave heaven while also having her help manage the chaotic spiritual plants in the cave heaven was truly killing two birds with one stone.</p><p></p><p>Since Li Fan devoured the Five Elements Great Cave Heaven, his strength had further improved.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Cave Heaven also continued to slowly grow, and the wood-attributed cave heaven continued to fall into a state of wild growth.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoren's arrival was just perfect!</p><p></p><p>As for the continent full of spiritual plants that Li Fan later moved, it was the Medicine King Sect's secret realm, Changsheng Valley!</p><p></p><p>In any case, it was destined to be Li Fan's possession. It was just right to transfer it to the wood-attributed cave heaven and process it together.</p><p></p><p>"It won't be long before the Medicine King Cauldron returns."</p><p></p><p>"The problem of insufficient manpower in the Myriad Realms Alliance will soon be alleviated."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's vision seemed to penetrate the obstruction of the small world and reach the sky of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The turmoil brought about by Baihua Daoren's appearance gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>A month later, Mo Rubin finally quietly contacted Li Fan.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 554</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>For some time after that, Han Yi did indeed live a smooth and comfortable life in this "Zhuxian" village.</p><p></p><p>Without worries about food and clothing, he used the "Feathers of Xuan Niao" in his dantian to absorb the lingering celestial energy between heaven and earth during his leisure time.</p><p></p><p>When the Zhuxian village was attacked by monsters from other villages, he secretly invoked the "Authority of Celestial Energy," conjuring up winds, rain, sand, and stones to help them defeat several waves of external enemies.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Han Yi's status in Zhuxian village became higher and higher.</p><p></p><p>Not only did the monsters in Zhuxian village specially build a tall stone building as his residence, but they also equipped him with ten strong guards to protect him closely.</p><p></p><p>They even offered the most pure "young girls" in Zhuxian village to him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the half-human, half-cat figure of the other party, Han Yi felt a chill in his heart and decisively declined.</p><p></p><p>Just when Han Yi thought he would play the role of a "divine son" in Zhuxian village for a long time, an unexpected incident occurred.</p><p></p><p>One night, he suddenly woke up inexplicably.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings were silent, but Han Yi felt a pounding heart.</p><p></p><p>Quietly getting up to investigate, he was horrified to find out that the ten bodyguards who were supposed to guard him day and night had suddenly disappeared at some point.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi knew something was wrong, and without even having time to pack his belongings, he was about to escape from his residence.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he realized that while he was sound asleep, nearly a hundred masked soldiers in black had completely surrounded his residence.</p><p></p><p>Illuminated by the faint flickering light in his residence, Han Yi could vaguely perceive that these soldiers were more beastly than the villagers in Zhuxian village.</p><p></p><p>Although they still had human bodies, their limbs were robust, and their hands had turned into those resembling demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that these people were targeting him.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the danger, Han Yi decisively called upon all the celestial energy he had absorbed in these days.</p><p></p><p>As the soldiers searched for Han Yi's whereabouts, a beam of light suddenly lit up in the sky, illuminating the night in an instant.</p><p></p><p>A huge fireball fell straight towards Zhuxian village.</p><p></p><p>The black-clothed soldiers present were stunned by this scene.</p><p></p><p>The sleeping villagers of Zhuxian village were also awakened, watching this scene of what seemed like doomsday unfolding above them, at a loss.</p><p></p><p>As Han Yi felt the depletion of all the celestial energy accumulated in these days, he hid in a corner made of solid boulders.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Han Yi thought that the meteor he summoned with all his might would surely crush all the black-clothed soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that in the face of this threat of death, one of the soldiers suddenly emitted a deafening roar.</p><p></p><p>His body instantly enlarged several times, kicked off the ground, and soared into the air.</p><p></p><p>He flew straight towards the meteor in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the violent explosion, that figure slammed back down to the ground at an even faster speed than when he ascended.</p><p></p><p>Covered in blood, he was no longer in one piece.</p><p></p><p>However, the meteor summoned by Han Yi had ultimately been slightly diverted from its trajectory.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it crashed towards the center of Zhuxian village, where the houses were densely packed.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The earth trembled.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, Zhuxian village turned into almost ruins. Cries and wails filled the air.</p><p></p><p>Although the hundreds of black-clothed soldiers had managed to dodge the direct impact of the meteor, they could not escape the aftermath of the collision, resulting in heavy casualties.</p><p></p><p>Due to his early preparation and the remaining celestial energy protecting him, Han Yi was unharmed.</p><p></p><p>Feeling that it was no longer safe, taking advantage of the night and chaos, he quietly escaped from Zhuxian village alone.</p><p></p><p>After fleeing for more than ten miles, just as he thought he was safe.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly sensed a gust of wind attacking from behind and hastily tried to dodge it.</p><p></p><p>However, he was a step too slow and could not evade it.</p><p></p><p>As if an invisible blade, it cut a large wound on his back.</p><p></p><p>Enduring the severe pain, Han Yi turned around to see who had attacked him.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, it turned out to be someone he knew!</p><p></p><p>The high priest of Zhuxian village, Xi!</p><p></p><p>Han Yi pretended to angrily question him about the reason for the attack.</p><p></p><p>In reality, he was desperately absorbing the celestial energy in secret, hoping to seek a chance for survival.</p><p></p><p>Thinking that Han Yi was already at the end of the road and could not escape, Xi did not rush to attack but rather expressed his resentment, revealing the reasons behind his plan of the attack.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that ever since Han Yi repeatedly showed "miracles," the revered high priest, Xi, who was respected by the villagers, slowly became "unemployed."</p><p></p><p>The primary duty of a priest is to represent the villagers and communicate with the gods.</p><p></p><p>They report the prayers of the villagers to the gods and announce any divine messages they receive.</p><p></p><p>However, with Han Yi repeatedly demonstrating miraculous abilities almost equivalent to those of the gods, why would the villagers bother finding the "spokesperson" like Xi.</p><p></p><p>Having lost the authority to interpret the will of the gods, all the honors that were once bestowed upon Xi were replaced by Han Yi.</p><p></p><p>Watching Han Yi reside in a grand palace, and watching the villagers bow in fear whenever Han Yi went out...</p><p></p><p>The jealousy in Xi's heart grew like a venomous snake.</p><p></p><p>Even though Han Yi displayed divine powers, Xi even entertained the thought of "killing a god."</p><p></p><p>However, obviously, besides him, there would be no one else in Zhuxian village who would support this action.</p><p></p><p>So, he turned his attention to the nearby Kang village, more prosperous than Zhuxian village. The villagers there were notably more powerful in their beastly transformations.</p><p></p><p>However, there had been no major conflicts between the two villages. The vast wilderness was resourceful and almost inexhaustible.</p><p></p><p>【A longtime book friend of ten years recommended me a book-chasing app, Switch app! It's really useful, I rely on this app for listening to books while driving or before bed, you can download it here】</p><p></p><p>Though occasional disagreements occurred between Kang and Zhuxian villages, they were often resolved through negotiation and friendly means.</p><p></p><p>However, Xi's secret visit changed everything.</p><p></p><p>Xi revealed to the leader of Kang village news of the "descent of a deity" in Zhuxian village.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he warned that with the assistance of the deity, the ambitions of the mayor of Zhuxian village had expanded.</p><p></p><p>He sought to dominate in all directions and become the "Emperor" of the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>This process would undoubtedly be filled with bloody killings.</p><p></p><p>Not willing to see so many lives lost, Xi discreetly came to ask Kang village to eliminate Han Yi, the mastermind behind the swindle in the name of the deity.</p><p></p><p>After some persuasion, the leader of Kang village also felt that it was too dangerous to allow Zhuxian village to have control over the "descended deity."</p><p></p><p>So, after several days of planning, with Xi acting as an insider, Kang picked the right moment and quietly surrounded Han Yi's residence with around a hundred elite villagers.</p><p></p><p>Although Xi had informed him that the descending deity possessed powerful abilities to summon rains and storms.</p><p></p><p>Kang was very confident.</p><p></p><p>The elite force under his command had fought their way through mountains of corpses and seas of blood.</p><p></p><p>They were not afraid of swords, let alone just some wind and rain.</p>

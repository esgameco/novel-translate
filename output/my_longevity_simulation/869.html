        <div class="content">
            <p>"Not bad, I also misjudged the situation before."</p><p></p><p>"Originally, I thought that the things inside this fishing pond were already placed in there when it was forged a thousand years ago."</p><p></p><p>"But the thing I fished up last time was not a creation from that time at all."</p><p></p><p>"Instead, it only appeared within the last five hundred years."</p><p></p><p>The Stone Slab Fisherman opened his palm, revealing a black jade curved like a horn.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." Li Fan couldn't recognize it.</p><p></p><p>"The Conquering Heaven Horn. An invention of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. When blown, it can briefly invoke the power of the Heavenly Dao of a province." The Stone Slab Fisherman explained concisely.</p><p></p><p>"Myriad Immortals Alliance?" Li Fan was stunned at first, and then his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Turning his head to look at the fishing pond, his mind was suddenly filled with surging thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Understood? The things inside this fishing pond are not unchanging. Instead, it captures and supplements new objects from the outside world, not only from Xuanhuang, but even from other immortal realms."</p><p></p><p>"While we are fishing in the starry sky, it is also fishing the myriad heavens..."</p><p></p><p>The Stone Slab Fisherman's words confirmed Li Fan's guess in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It was like setting off towering waves, making his state of mind unable to calm down for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had personally experienced the mysteriousness of the fishing pond, he didn't expect that he still didn't know its full picture.</p><p></p><p>"This is the power of an immortal artifact."</p><p></p><p>"Not only does it contain countless treasures, there's also no need to worry about them being used up."</p><p></p><p>This was what Li Fan thought.</p><p></p><p>However, what the Stone Slab Fisherman cared about was something else.</p><p></p><p>His tone, which had always been somewhat calm, couldn't help but fluctuate a little: "This is the true Dao of Fishing."</p><p></p><p>"This immortal artifact is extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>"If it can be mastered, perhaps, without relying on it, I can fish the myriad heavens myself and find the things I want." The Stone Slab Fisherman's voice was a bit excited.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but fall silent.</p><p></p><p>Only now did he react.</p><p></p><p>How could the person chosen by an extraordinary object like the Creation Stone Slab possibly be some mediocre fellow?</p><p></p><p>With his new discovery, the Stone Slab Fisherman stopped fishing.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also changed his appearance.</p><p></p><p>No longer in the form of a fisherman, but a seemingly newborn infant.</p><p></p><p>He fell into a deep sleep by the pond.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a few more days and seeing no signs of him waking up,</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head and withdrew.</p><p></p><p>"He just had to occupy the fishing pond, no one dares to disturb him."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt helpless in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He could only instruct Lin Ling to wait here, and contact him as soon as there was any movement.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then returned to the Lingmu Realm alone.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he received news from the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>"Even the Five Elders Council's contact was fake."</p><p></p><p>"This Senior Stone Slab, he really gets into character when acting." Recalling the other party's tone and expression, Li Fan secretly shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"This is probably one of his quirks. Fortunately, he has a good temper. He didn't want to kill me at the slightest disagreement."</p><p></p><p>In the past few days following Senior Stone Slab, besides learning some ancient secrets,</p><p></p><p>The most important thing was figuring out the essence of the conflict between the Myriad Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Council in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled the other party's lament.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Realm is a sinking ship."</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Council are fighting for the final control of the ship."</p><p></p><p>"They both have absolute confidence, believing that they can save the Xuanhuang Realm from sinking..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Escape from fate. But the prerequisite is that a final ruler must be decided."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, just like the Ten Immortal Sects from many years ago."</p><p></p><p>"It's not that they were blinded by power, but they wanted to escape, and had to coordinate and centralize the power of the entire realm. If there were people inside who were two-faced..."</p><p></p><p>"So, it doesn't matter if there's fighting and killing. Once there's a real threat to the existence of the Xuanhuang Realm, both sides will still join hands. Just like five hundred years ago, when that group of traitors returned."</p><p></p><p>When Shiban Yufu mentioned that group of traitors, his tone also rarely became fierce.</p><p></p><p>"Five hundred years ago, it should be referring to the counterattack of the small worlds. However, these small worlds seem to be just puppets. The real mastermind behind the scenes should be the cultivators who had once betrayed the Xuanhuang Realm." In the Lingmu Realm, Li Fan was really lost in thought as he corroborated Shiban Yufu's words with the secrets he had investigated before.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the bearer of the Creation Stone Tablet, you know too many secrets. It's just a pity that your strength is not enough."</p><p></p><p>"How much you want to know all depends on the other party's mood to bestow it."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, you must interrogate them day and night."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts slowly turned.</p><p></p><p>From the perspective of Senior Shiban, many things that Li Fan couldn't see clearly and seemed to be in a fog also became clear and understandable.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but ask, "What about the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate? What is his attitude towards all this?"</p><p></p><p>Shiban Yufu seemed to have heard a very funny joke.</p><p></p><p>First, he laughed loudly as if no one was around.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he answer, "Dharma Transmission?"</p><p></p><p>"Although Xuanhuang is sinking..."</p><p></p><p>"But can Dharma Transmission fly?"</p><p></p><p>"He doesn't care at all."</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Shiban Yufu's smile suddenly subsided.</p><p></p><p>"This is just my speculation."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, for the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate who regards the Xuanhuang Realm as his own private property, his attitude is also somewhat unpredictable."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, in so many years, he could have left long ago."</p><p></p><p>Shiban Yufu's voice gradually weakened and finally became inaudible.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Dharma Transmission can fly."</p><p></p><p>"Sure enough, she is already able to ignore the influence of the Immortal Ruins and leave on her own."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, to what extent one's strength must reach to be able to escape from Xuanhuang?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps..."</p><p></p><p>"I can give it a try."</p><p></p><p>This idea suddenly surged in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Although in the Xuanhuang Realm, apart from the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate, none of the Longevity Realm experts had escaped.</p><p></p><p>But Xuanhuang Longevity is bound to the world.</p><p></p><p>It's possible that it's not that their strength is insufficient, but because of the counteraction arising from their ties.</p><p></p><p>Just like Senior Shiban.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, it doesn't necessarily have to rely entirely on one's own strength. External forces can also be used."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled the countless square pyramids towering on the land of Xuanhuang in the 114th world.</p><p></p><p>"I used the Five Elements Primordial Cave to form my Nascent Soul. If I unite the five elements and smelt them into a new world."</p><p></p><p>"Then build square pyramids on the earth, using the thrust..."</p><p></p><p>"There is a possibility of escaping the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>In fact, with [Huan Zhen], Li Fan had no intention of fighting the Xuanhuang Realm to the death.</p><p></p><p>If possible, being able to find another cultivation realm would definitely be much better than this ghost place.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the Xuanhuang Realm on the verge of sinking, no matter what happens, it's not surprising.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Li Fan had also encountered too many demons and monsters.</p><p></p><p>"One attempt, two-pronged approach."</p>

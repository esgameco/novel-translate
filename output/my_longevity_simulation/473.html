        <h1>Chapter 473</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>His thoughts were unconventional, often filled with whimsical ideas. He also enjoyed drinking, often getting drunk and sharing his unrealistic fantasies with his friends after a drinking session.</p><p></p><p>His friends always took it as drunken ramblings, mostly just laughing it off.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, Guo Yezhong got drunk to the point of being completely wasted.</p><p></p><p>He recounted to his friends the visions he had seen in his dreams: a black sky resembling a spider web; enveloping everything and locking all living beings.</p><p></p><p>Because it was too bizarre, none of his friends took it seriously this time as well, all treating it as a joke.</p><p></p><p>Instead, after Guo Yezhong sobered up, he mocked them for it.</p><p></p><p>To everyone's surprise, as soon as Guo Yezhong heard that, his expression changed immediately. He warned his friends not to speak out of turn and then left in a huff.</p><p></p><p>For the next few days, he shut himself inside, not going out.</p><p></p><p>Until suddenly, he said he had a vague realization and wanted to go out to seek an opportunity to break through to the Golden Core realm.</p><p></p><p>From then on, he never returned.</p><p></p><p>Several days later, an anomaly occurred that led others to discover his body.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Fake alcohol is harmful!" Li Fan sighed softly and fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Was the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance killing to prevent leaks?</p><p></p><p>For the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, which urgently needed talents in formations, it was completely unnecessary.</p><p></p><p>A simple summons could have had him shed blood for the completion of the Black Sky Soul-locking Formation. There was no need for such extreme measures.</p><p></p><p>"The remaining possibility is that the Five Elders Council took action. Novel69shu.com."</p><p></p><p>"After I leaked information about the Black Sky Soul-locking Formation to the Five Elders Council, they must have tried all means to gather related information."</p><p></p><p>"However, due to the strict secrecy of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, they rarely gained any insight."</p><p></p><p>"Until they found out that a seemingly inconspicuous Foundation Building cultivator had openly mentioned scenes related to the Black Sky Soul-locking Formation after a drinking session."</p><p></p><p>"So, Guo Yezhong came to a bad end..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan rubbed his chin, speculating on the possible course of events.</p><p></p><p>"Although Guo Yezhong had extremely high talent in formations, he probably knew very little about the Black Sky Soul-locking Formation. At most, he just had a faint concept."</p><p></p><p>"And the research on formations by the Five Elders Council was no less than that of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance. With Guo Yezhong as the key, it was hard to predict the eventual outcome."</p><p></p><p>"For the Black Sky Soul-locking Formation in this world, the display by the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance was even more extensive than the previous world."</p><p></p><p>"It could almost be certain that under the confrontation between the two sides, either the Black Sky Soul-locking Formation would not be created. Or it would evolve into a more frightening existence than in the previous world."</p><p></p><p>"The best we can hope for is that the Five Elders Council may keep their cool. If necessary, I can help them."</p><p></p><p>After careful consideration, Li Fan recalled the structural diagram of the Soul-locking Formation.</p><p></p><p>It took a long time before he calmed down the conflicting thoughts in his mind.</p><p></p><p>For the vast majority of cultivators in the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, who were unaware, this major event that could affect the future direction of the Yellow Realm did not concern them.</p><p></p><p>To them, life remained peaceful as usual, with no noticeable difference.</p><p></p><p>Completing tasks, accumulating contributions, exchanging techniques, gathering resources for cultivation, and occasionally relaxing and playing.</p><p></p><p>This was their daily life.</p><p></p><p>The topics discussed by cultivators in the past were nothing but which young genius had broken through again or who had a stroke of luck and found a new technique in the sect relics, and similar topics.</p><p></p><p>But this year, a name became a frequent guest in their conversations.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, a cultivator from the Tianji Sect.</p><p></p><p>He had accurately foretold the surge in prices of the Pu-Xian Zhen leaves.</p><p></p><p>Although most participants in events ended up with heavy losses, leading them to resent Li Fan intensely, they never doubted his divination abilities.</p><p></p><p>However, from an unknown time, a group of crazy admirers of Li Fan's divination skills emerged.</p><p></p><p>They vowed that Li Fan's divination skills were extraordinary and surpassed those of the long-renowned masters in the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Besides the Pu-Xian Zhen leaves incident, it seemed that Li Fan had other achievements.</p><p></p><p>But when asked, the group would all remain silent, looking like they wanted you to believe it or not.</p><p></p><p>However, merely being good at divination, Li Fan, an Ancient Tianji Sect cultivator, would not have triggered such heated discussions.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the fundamental reason lay in Li Fan's ability to bring wealth to others.</p><p></p><p>Although it seemed like a Ponzi scheme on the surface, with the endorsement of the "exceptionally good at divination" ability, everything became more believable.</p><p></p><p>Accumulating contributions was extremely difficult! A fifty percent profit in a year was incredibly tempting!</p><p></p><p>With the itch getting unbearable, many cultivators found He Zhenghao, seeking to join the next investment plan.</p><p></p><p>The large number of cultivators coming to inquire left He Zhenghao, who thought he had seen everything, stunned.</p><p></p><p>He spent his days hiding in the Luminous Island's defense formation, afraid to go out.</p><p></p><p>It was only after contacting Li Fan and getting his approval that he finally felt at ease.</p><p></p><p>Following Li Fan's advice, he issued a statement.</p><p></p><p>Due to the overwhelming number of cultivators seeking investment, exceeding Li Fan's capacity, he was forced to make a difficult decision.</p><p></p><p>This time, he would only accept contributions from a maximum of five hundred cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Based on the amount of contribution each was willing to pay, they would be accepted in descending order.</p><p></p><p>The news stirred curses among the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a while, most people eventually chose to give up.</p><p></p><p>However, there was a small group who used their contributions to vote for Li Fan's trust.</p><p></p><p>With the introduction of a competitive mechanism, the third round of contributions soared unexpectedly to over fifteen million.</p><p></p><p>An average of over thirty thousand per person.</p><p></p><p>This was still the case with everyone holding back and trying it out.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's face blossomed with a smile as the money kept pouring in.</p><p></p><p>Because of his hard work, Li Fan promised to give him one percent of the profits as a reward.</p><p></p><p>So he worked even harder.</p><p></p><p>He even persuaded the investors to dig deeper into their resources.</p><p></p><p>While this "great swindler" Li Fan was fervently amassing wealth, the "Foundation Building Masters" of the empire were not idle.</p><p></p><p>Although the ten million contributions granted by Li Fan allowed these lawbreakers to complete their mission ahead of schedule.</p><p></p><p>But to make sufficient preparations to completely detach from the Yellow Realm in the future, the lawbreakers did not stop their actions; they continued to earn contributions through various means, exchanging them for resources and quietly transporting them back to the empire.</p><p></p><p>One day, a special guest arrived on the island.</p><p></p><p>"Saved up for so long, it should be enough."</p><p></p><p>"Adding this famous Foundation Building Master, I will definitely breakthrough to the Foundation Building realm this time."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, my fate will be in my own hands, and although the immortal realm is vast, I, Han Yi, will be able to go wherever my heart desires!"</p>

            <p>Chapter 1059: The Heavenly King is Like a Luo Luo</p><p></p><p>"If we're lucky, we might even find the Holy Emperor tomorrow." The Imperial Princess's tone was somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>"After finding the Holy Emperor, don't hastily make contact with him. There must be hidden reasons behind the Holy Emperor's sudden departure back then. First report to the Alliance, and I will make the final decision." Li Fan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Princess nodded, indicating her understanding. </p><p></p><p>In the past five years, Li Fan had informed the Empire of all the cave heavens and small worlds discovered in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Through some strange beasts that could freely shuttle through space, the Empire conducted a round of screening on these small worlds. The purpose was to find out where Xu Ke was hiding.</p><p></p><p>In the 115th generation, before the final battle between Tiandao Bai and the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerable...</p><p></p><p>The figure that appeared beside Tiandao Bai, carrying a coffin on his back, should be Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>As for what exactly was in the coffin, and why he suddenly left the empire he founded back then, even abandoning his several beloved ones...</p><p></p><p>All these questions could be answered once he was found.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan was actually not particularly concerned about this. It was just a means to appease the people of the Empire.</p><p></p><p>After revealing information about Xu Ke, the Empire became truly convinced and their work efficiency more than doubled without Li Fan's supervision and urging.</p><p></p><p>After giving instructions, Li Fan came to the deepest part of the dome laboratory.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, red threads floated like swimming snakes.</p><p></p><p>This was the red rope left by Mr. White in the Empire and given to Xu Ke for self-defense.</p><p></p><p>With just one thread, it could kill the top powerhouses of the demon race, almost no weaker than the current Dharma Immortal's full-strength strike.</p><p></p><p>Out of wariness of Mr. White, Li Fan did not directly interact with it in this life.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he let the Empire and others conduct research directly.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, the red rope seemed to be a form of existence of some sword dao.</p><p></p><p>But after several years of uninterrupted experiments, the Empire discovered that this red rope was more like a living thing with its own spirituality.</p><p></p><p>To drive it, one did not need spiritual energy, but the mysterious essence, energy and spirit of biological beings - in simple terms, the lifespan of living beings.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, ordinary creatures were not worthy in the eyes of this red rope. Only those rising individuals among the races would interest it to devour.</p><p></p><p>After nurturing it with a large number of strange beasts, the red rope, which was originally only an extremely thin thread, had become like a slender snake in the dome laboratory.</p><p></p><p>Even separated by several layers of formation protection, it was still dreadful to behold.</p><p></p><p>The avatar cultivated with the Heavenly Wonder of the Black Sword, so Li Fan was quite familiar with the sword dao of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>After careful study, Li Fan discovered that the red rope contained not only the dao of the sword.</p><p></p><p>More of it was the [Dao of Balance].</p><p></p><p>To hurt others, a price must be paid. So it first hurts itself.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of heaven and earth, all living beings are equal.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, wielding this sharp sword, a mortal body can slay the united dao.</p><p></p><p>This was a very classic ancient law theory, similar records could be found in many ancient books Li Fan had read before.</p><p></p><p>Mr. White was the last ancient dharma immortal heavenly venerable in the Xuanhuang Realm, so it was not surprising that the divine powers he taught had such characteristics.</p><p></p><p>However, as times changed, even in the eyes of heaven and earth, living beings were no longer the same.</p><p></p><p>The higher the cultivation of a cultivator, the more weight they occupied in heaven and earth, and the more they were hated by heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Hatred.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary people, a "one-for-one" exchange is no longer possible.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the actual utility of this red string has also been discounted.</p><p></p><p>After calculations, Li Fan determined that the power unleashed by a single strand of red string is enough to destroy the body of a Hua Shen cultivator. However, the new method of Hua Shen body relying on heaven and earth will not fall because of this. It will only suffer heavy injuries. As for those who have attained the Dao, they can easily block the attack of the red string.</p><p></p><p>However, this is only the smallest unit of measurement for the red string.</p><p></p><p>If all the power of this bowl-thick red string in front of him were released...</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan has no confidence in preserving his life in front of it. If there was no protection from the Tian Yang Xian Puppet.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems that the red string has reached its limit and refuses to consume more.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the red string moving in the darkness and fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"The essence of the red string is to use the power of the Xuanhuang Realm's Heavenly Dao against the enemy. It is not abuse, but an exchange within the scope allowed by the rules."</p><p></p><p>"Using the power of the red string will still consume the cultivator's own lifespan."</p><p></p><p>"But losing only a little bit of life can defeat or even kill Hua Shen cultivators..."</p><p></p><p>"If this spreads, those willing will surely flock to it."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it can be used as the signboard of the Myriad Realms Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"It can be called..."</p><p></p><p>"Sword Wielder."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed with brilliance, and he ordered nearly a hundred strands to be separated from this red string, and then sealed and packed them separately with seven-colored divine light.</p><p></p><p>"As long as you join the Myriad Realms Alliance, you can wield this sword and slay Hua Shen cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to say that our alliance has no foundation?"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, slaying the new method cultivators is the will of Heaven, so there is no need to worry about excessive killing triggering the backlash of Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>Even though a portion was removed, the drifting red string still did not resume consuming.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the total amount of red string in the Xuanhuang Realm is fixed, and some needs to be consumed before it can regenerate.</p><p></p><p>Although the red string is mysterious, Li Fan will not use it himself.</p><p></p><p>He will only give it to members of the Myriad Realms Alliance as a life-saving magic treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Just right, among the death knights who previously explored the Blood River, some have successfully survived. They can be bestowed with this magic treasure, and then formally taught immortal techniques as a reward and encouragement." With this thought, Li Fan left the Imperial Small World area.</p><p></p><p>He arrived at the [Seeking Secluded] area.</p><p></p><p>On the countless empty pedestals, the first monument has quietly descended.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet was engraved with the name and appearance of the cultivator who had retrieved the lost history from the Blood River.</p><p></p><p>And the impact of that historical segment could be viewed through this stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>The first harvest was actually an irrelevant scene.</p><p></p><p>The time point was probably before the Immortal Path was severed.</p><p></p><p>Visitors from other immortal realms, riding more than a dozen immortal boats, came in a grand procession.</p><p></p><p>Various sects in the Xuanhuang Realm all sent out teams to welcome them, and held a grand exchange conference.</p><p></p><p>It was lively and full of vitality.</p><p></p><p>Completely different from the lifeless Xuanhuang Realm of today.</p><p></p><p>Every cultivator, upon seeing this scene, will inevitably feel a faint sense of loss and sadness in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>There was actually a very interesting point in this scene.</p><p></p><p>In this exchange event, Li Fan actually saw the figure of Xuantian King Xuanyuan Hong.</p><p></p><p>However, at that time, he was just one of the many cultivators responsible for entertaining.</p><p></p><p>Standing like a minion, his face tense and excited as he looked at those senior cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Probably no one present could have imagined that it was this inconspicuous little cultivator who later became the last ascender of the Xuanhuang Realm and shouldered the task of saving the world.</p><p></p><p>Recommended new book by the author of "I Just Want to Be a Peaceful Daoist".

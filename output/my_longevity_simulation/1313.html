        <div class="content">
            <p>"The Dao of Immortals is depicted using the True Immortal Seal Script, illustrating the path to immortality. However, there are different levels within the Dao of Immortals."</p><p></p><p>"As I have seen before, hunger, chaos, solitude, and return are probably the most basic. The True Immortal Seal Script that may represent the transformative power of creation is clearly above them."</p><p></p><p>"And the path represented by this hidden mark within the bodies of the Youzu people..."</p><p></p><p>"The transformation between the mortal and the immortal, surpasses the so-called creation!"</p><p></p><p>"And Huanzhen..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took a deep breath, trying to calm himself.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had already experienced Huanzhen one hundred and twenty-five times, each time personally experiencing the magnificent power of resetting all things in the world in an instant, knowing that Huanzhen almost transcends everything currently known.</p><p></p><p>But at the end of the previous life, the process of Huanzhen was interfered with by unknown variables. Coupled with the terrifying power displayed by the creature Maobao outside the wall, it inevitably caused Li Fan to have a hint of doubt about the upper limit of Huanzhen. As he gradually came into contact with the forces outside the wall, would Huanzhen still be able to advance unimpeded as it did in the Darkest Starry Sea?</p><p></p><p>This discovery gave Li Fan a reassurance.</p><p></p><p>The limit of Huanzhen was far more unfathomable than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>"The laws of the Xuanhuang Realm can be regarded as a partial projection of the laws of the Darkest Starry Sea. Similarly, the laws of the Darkest Starry Sea are also a partial projection of the laws of the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>"And Huanzhen, almost stands above everything. Theoretically, the reflection from top to bottom can replicate everything I have come into contact with out of thin air through the transformation of 'false is true'."</p><p></p><p>"As long as my power and understanding are sufficient."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered, recalling the feeling when he was writing that mysterious mark.</p><p></p><p>"This is only the transformation of 'false is true'. Huanzhen is not only about 'false is true'."</p><p></p><p>"There is also the previous 'true becomes false'!"</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Li Fan casually took a round stone block beside him. Staring intently at the round stone, he tried to directly erase its existence through 'true becomes false'.</p><p></p><p>But every time during the process of Huanzhen, the originally real world around him seemed to be shrouded in white fog, making it unclear. Therefore, Li Fan could not know how this process of 'true becomes false' was actually realized.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps during Huanzhen this time, I can try to actively dispel the surrounding fog." This thought couldn't help but arise in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"If I can gain some insight in this aspect, relying on the supreme power of Huanzhen, I might be able to directly cross a major realm and erase opponents at will..."</p><p></p><p>As his thoughts raced, Li Fan sorted out the mysterious symbols he had glimpsed over the past year while possessing the body of a Youzu person, based on the remnants in his impression.</p><p></p><p>Then he handed them over to the Doomsday Dissociation Disc for classification and application.</p><p></p><p>Handling two tasks involving immortal formations at the same time, the efficiency of the Dissociation Disc inevitably dropped a lot.</p><p></p><p>"It seems it's time to upgrade the Dissociation Disc again. Purely relying on the sublimation triggered by the immortal formation data is ultimately constrained by the mortal physique."</p><p></p><p>"The nine initial Dissociation Discs of the Wanxian Alliance can be said to be completely different objects from the one in my hand now. The help they can provide is negligible. To thoroughly transform into an immortal tool Dissociation Disc, immortal spiritual power is ultimately needed..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pressed his slightly swollen brow due to overwork. After relaxing, he looked at the Youzu people here.</p><p></p><p>They did not feel grief because of the death of the person Li Fan possessed.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they felt particularly invigorated by his dedication to the great Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Youzu people's devout appearance, Li Fan was deeply moved. With a wave of his big hand, he instantly took them all into his body and suppressed them for the time being.</p><p></p><p>When he returned to the small world of Daqi, he would provide them with the best living conditions, allowing them to stay in Daqi and pray at ease for the rest of their lives.</p><p></p><p>The small world where the Youzu people were located was slightly weaker than Daxuan. Naturally, it also did not give birth to a Dao consciousness.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan took action, it was much easier for him.</p><p></p><p>He created a simulated Heavenly Essence to directly replace the Dao and maintain the normal operation of this small world.</p><p></p><p>Then, as before, he seamlessly grafted it into the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Practice makes perfect. This time, the technique of mending the Heavens went very smoothly.</p><p></p><p>With one more small world Dao clone, the insights surged like tumbling waves, occasionally emerging in his mind. Even if his position was insufficient, this large-scale emergence of Dao inspiration could still provide Li Fan with some substantial enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"These Dao insights are useless to me, but for other cultivators, they are rarely seen in a lifetime." After returning to Daxuan and settling the Youzu people, causing a large portion of them to change their faith.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the cultivators sitting densely on the central lecture platform in Daxuan, his heart stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>Buzz...</p><p></p><p>A platform emerged out of nowhere. It was located below the technique catalog platform and above the numerous disciples.</p><p></p><p>The platform was carved with all kinds of scenes, creatures, and objects in the world. Yet, it was like a living thing, constantly changing and vividly lifelike.</p><p></p><p>If one looked closely, with some luck, one could occasionally discover the seven-colored flashing light spots in the stone carvings.</p><p></p><p>Those were all the insights of the simulated Heavenly Essence that Li Fan couldn't use.</p><p></p><p>If the cultivators on the lecture platform were fortunate enough to comprehend them, it would not be difficult for them to make rapid progress in cultivation and even comprehend unique divine powers.</p><p></p><p>"The living beings on the lecture platform are all under my surveillance. Their inspirations are also my inspirations."</p><p></p><p>"Although their realms are low, the sparks of thought, magnified countless times, are still brilliant. Even if among ten thousand people, there is one who can enlighten me. With the number of cultivators on this lecture platform, it will accumulate into a considerable fortune over time."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, if necessary, I can also mobilize the lecture platform and manipulate the thoughts of the cultivators on it, making them help me comprehend together..."</p><p></p><p>Inside the lecture platform, the silver-white spheres resembling eyes absorbed the inner inspirations from different living beings above from time to time. They gradually became somewhat uncanny, as if coming to life, constantly rotating slightly towards the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The Sage Teacher's projection, after initially completing the preaching mission in Daxuan, split into another body and went to the next small world.</p><p></p><p>This newly split body was not supported by the power of Li Fan's true self. Instead, it was formed by the Sage Teacher's projection absorbing the power of faith from the disciples during the preaching process.</p><p></p><p>It was similar to the Emperor's Qi Canon, but Daqi had become Daxuan, the soldiers had become students, and the Sacred Emperor had become the Sage Teacher.</p><p></p><p>The current initial stage of expansion would be handled by these projections. When the preaching began to alarm the Wanxian Alliance or other hidden powerhouses in the small worlds, Li Fan would personally take action to suppress and subdue them.</p><p></p><p>Before that, Li Fan still needed to prepare for the future confrontation...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The Youzu people, whose beliefs were changed by differentiation, had begun to provide Li Fan with the initial essence of the source power.</p><p></p><p>"There will be a dramatic change in the world, which you may not be able to recognize. Let me try to discuss it now."</p><p></p><p>On the Daxuan lecture platform, Li Fan's true body replaced the virtual image, sitting solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Below, Yin Shangren and others listened to Li Fan's lecture.</p><p></p><p>However, what Li Fan talked about was the revival of the starry sea, leading to the future revival of the Xuanhuang world.</p><p></p><p>The crowd listened with a mixture of belief and doubt.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly and pointed to the sky, as if opening a vortex leading outside the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, please follow me."</p><p></p><p>With a seven-colored rainbow light appearing on his body, Li Fan invited everyone to enter.</p><p></p><p>The crowd looked at each other, but eventually they all entered Li Fan's rainbow light protection.</p><p></p><p>The seven-colored light soared into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Passing through the vortex in the sky, the next moment, they suddenly appeared at the boundary of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>From the momentum, there was no sign of stopping at all.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to continue rushing towards the starry sky of the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>The faces of the crowd instantly turned pale.</p><p></p><p>They all knew that there was a terrible suction force outside the Xuanhuang realm. Once leaving the protection of the Xuanhuang realm, they might fall into it the next moment and find it difficult to escape alive.</p><p></p><p>But what happened next was far beyond their expectations.</p><p></p><p>The seven-colored rainbow light separated into different colors, drawing a curved arc in the starry sea. It actually successfully took the crowd away from the Xuanhuang realm!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was stunned.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan still did not stop and continued to fly rapidly towards the depths of the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>The desolation of the starry sea made the crowd feel emotional and showed sadness in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The crisis in the starry sea made the crowd startled and their expressions solemn.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, like a prophet, was able to bypass the dangerous areas in the starry sea every time, which made the crowd look at him with admiration.</p><p></p><p>They all speculated how many times Li Fan had traveled back and forth in the starry sky to be so familiar with it.</p><p></p><p>However, as they continued to go deeper into the starry sea, Li Fan's speed also slowed down.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren and the others' feelings were not wrong. After all, when the Holy Emperor of the previous life enlightened in the center of the starry sky, the connection between him and his true body had become faint.</p><p></p><p>So on this journey to witness the Tao of the starry sea revival, the further back it went, the less memory there was to refer to, and the more Li Fan needed to find his own way forward.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, it was like looking for a needle in a haystack.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, relying on the vague feeling, had already touched the whereabouts of the original consciousness of this starry sea. It's just that the Holy Emperor of the previous life relied on the identity of the "Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao" incarnation, the possible savior of the starry sea. It attracted the attention of the original consciousness of the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>The Li Fan of this life, however, had not yet revealed the qualifications to be noticed by the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also did not intend to expose himself to the starry sea so early.</p><p></p><p>But this did not hinder Li Fan's next plan.</p><p></p><p>"It should be here." Feeling that it was about right, Li Fan stopped and looked at the void in front, sighing slightly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd looked over with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>In their perception, this starry sky was indeed different from before. It seemed a little brighter and warmer. But it was still far from the revival that Li Fan mentioned.</p><p></p><p>It still looked completely desolate.</p><p></p><p>However, since the other party had gone to such great lengths to bring them here, he definitely would not do it for nothing.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that my understanding is not enough?</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a trace of doubt about themselves flashed through everyone's minds.</p><p></p><p>Then they all continued to observe solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan saw the subtle changes in the expressions of the crowd, smiling without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he finally spoke and asked, "Have you all gained anything?"</p><p></p><p>The response to him was a moment of silence.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pretended to look a little surprised, pondered for a moment, and suddenly waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>He sent several rays of light into the minds of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>It was the Holy Emperor's understanding of the power of the starry sea revival in the previous life.</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the crowd instantly lit up.</p><p></p><p>Imperceptible threads of vitality appeared out of nowhere around them.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong, Baihua and others, who were able to survive the destruction of the immortal realm until now, were all naturally talented.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan took the results of enlightenment and directly threw them into their minds.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, they all realized something.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed so!" Baihua was the most touched.</p><p></p><p>"If I can master this revival power, maybe I can revive the Wansheng realm..."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren rubbed his head, and the remnant souls of the worlds he had devoured in his body seemed to be attracted by this revival power, wanting to drill out of his body again.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the crowd was immersed in the vastness of the starry sea's power.</p><p></p><p>They didn't notice at all that Li Fan, who guided them to enlightenment, had moved away from them for some unknown reason.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Li Fan also used a method close to immortal formations to temporarily conceal his own whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>He had a premonition in his heart that exposing his existence to the original consciousness of the darkest starry sea too early was definitely not a good thing.</p><p></p><p>"At least I have to wait until I successfully merge with the Dao and achieve the limit of the mortal realm." Li Fan looked at the enlightened crowd, his eyes flashing.</p><p></p><p>The crowd was immersed in enlightenment, and the time they woke up varied.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong was the first to wake up. His eyes were spinning, as if he had thought of some wonderful idea. He couldn't wait to return to the Xuanhuang realm immediately to conduct experiments.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren seemed to have spent a lot of time trying to solve the problem of the remnant ghosts of the realms in his body.</p><p></p><p>However, what surprised Li Fan a little was that Baihua was the last one to wake up.</p><p></p><p>From her eyes, Li Fan could feel Baihua's inner joy.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to you all for gaining something."</p><p></p><p>"The starry sea is full of dangers, and it is not suitable to stay for long. We should return as soon as possible." Li Fan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The crowd nodded and responded with a teacher's salute.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, with surprises but no danger, the crowd returned to the Daxuan lecture platform again.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, seeing is believing. After walking through the starry sea in person, the crowd had completely believed what Li Fan said.</p><p></p><p>The revival of the starry sea was just around the corner.</p><p></p><p>"You should all know that the desolation of the starry sea cannot be restored in a short period of time."</p><p></p><p>"As the only surviving place in the starry sea, Xuanhuang should become the source of the starry sea's revival."</p><p></p><p>"Only when vitality spreads from here can we achieve twice the result with half the effort."</p><p></p><p>After listening to Li Fan's conclusion and thinking about it, the crowd all nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"There is no greater achievement than assisting a dragon."</p><p></p><p>"If we can lend a helping hand in the revival of the starry sea, when the starry sea returns to its former glory in the future, the benefits we can obtain are needless to say." Li Fan looked at the crowd calmly.</p>

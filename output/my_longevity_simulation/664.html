        <h1>Chapter 664</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"The ten sects of the immortal path are undoubtedly formidable existences. What exactly is in the giant city in the sky that could create such powerful immortal sects?" Li Fan's face showed a look of shock, exclaiming at the words.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji nodded slightly, "When I first heard about this, I also had some doubts. But later on, after inquiring from various sources, I can confirm that this is true. The reason the ten sects of the immortal path were able to rise so abruptly is because of the opportunities they obtained in Tian Du!"</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan could ask further, he continued, "It is said that within Tian Du, although it is empty without any traces of living beings, there is a figure sitting cross-legged in the central tower. Beside the figure stands a boy. The figure's face is unclear, but it seems to be speaking towards the void in front. Countless profound and mysterious theories are like resounding bells echoing in everyone's ears. What's more miraculous is that the content heard by each person is different."</p><p></p><p>"The listeners are mesmerized, immersed in it. When they wake from their enlightenment, they want to continue listening. But they find that they can no longer hear anything from the figure. Instead, the boy next to the figure waves his hand lightly and drives them out of the tower."</p><p></p><p>"The cultivators who came out compare their insights and realize that they originated from their own knowledge. However, they are more profound and profound, far more exquisite than what the sects teach!"</p><p></p><p>"Despite their attempts, they can never enter that tower again."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji sighed, "These cultivators know how precious the opportunity there is. After quietly leaving Tian Du, they inform their disciples to come. Perhaps it was this action that caught the attention of Xuan Tian Sect. While chasing the cultivators from Tian Du, they sent out their minions to completely block the giant city in the sky."</p><p></p><p>"This disrespectful move seemed to displease the figure in Tian Du, who sent the boy to confront them. The outcome of the battle is unknown. Although the Xuan Tian Sect retreated, the remaining cultivators could no longer enter Tian Du."</p><p></p><p>"Every year, there are occasional purple mists falling, spreading throughout the Xuan Huang Realm. Those lucky enough to receive it, although not as good as hearing the figure speak in person, are not far off!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment and frowned, "Where did Tian Du go afterwards? At our time, why do so few people hear about it?"</p><p></p><p>"Tian Du hung in the sky for a whole decade. Just as it came quietly, it also left without a trace, unnoticed by anyone."</p><p></p><p>"And shortly after, the conflict between the Xuan Tian Sect and the immortal sects escalated to an irreconcilable point. Under the great war that engulfed the entire Xuan Huang Realm, no one cared about the disappeared Tian Du."</p><p></p><p>"In our time, Tian Du is only a legend mentioned in idle chatter."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalls, "I remember, I saw in the Tian Xuan Mirror before, in the Source Dao Province, there was a Taoist named Lan Yu. He claims to inherit from the great masters of Tian Du, but..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked puzzled, "I heard that Tian Du fell in ancient times for some unknown reason. Even now, remnants of Tian Du can still be seen on the earth..."</p><p></p><p>"What? Tian Du fell?" This time Fang Zaiji was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible! Absolutely impossible!" After a moment, Fang Zaiji firmly denied this claim. "If Tian Du really collided with the Xuan Huang Realm, who knows who would suffer more!"</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Zaiji, are you suggesting..." Li Fan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it is highly possible that Tian Du came from the legendary immortal realm! And the figure in Tian Du may be the legendary immortal! The reason why the figure could not be clearly seen by the disciples of the immortal sects is because, after ascending to immortality and completing the transformation of their life levels, they had far surpassed the understanding of ordinary cultivators!" Fang Zaiji said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"Another immortal. It didn't fall..." Li Fan remained undecided. He thought of the unknown existence hovering over the Source Dao Province, devouring time. Perhaps, it was because something happened that led to this mysterious phenomenon?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's disbelief, Fang Zaiji snorted, "Without seeing it with your own eyes, you cannot understand the power of a true immortal. If you were as fortunate as me to receive a strand of Tian Du's Purple Qi, then you would know my words are not false. Also, what Lan Yu said about coming from the lineage of the great masters of Tian Du might not be an empty claim. Because in the Tian Du Purple Qi, there are many inheritances from the great masters of Tian Du."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was surprised, "You received a strand of Tian Du's Purple Qi?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji looked smug, "Of course! At that time, I was just a naive child, only gaining the opportunity without knowing the reason behind it! Otherwise, how could an ordinary person like me, with no sect or lineage, reach the level of a Taoist? Those proud disciples of the immortal path sects would never have mentioned that hidden past to me if they had not sensed the essence of Tian Du's Purple Qi from me."</p><p></p><p>"Is the great master of Tian Du the figure in Tian Du?" Li Fan asked after a moment of silence.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji gave Li Fan a look, "What are you thinking? Said figure is very likely an immortal. Since she did not disclose it herself, how could the world know her identity? Moreover, simply having the opportunity to listen to her teachings, even the disciples of the immortal sects may not dare claim to have received the true transmission of immortal teachings. The so-called 'Great Master of Tian Du' we refer to is the boy next to the figure. By listening to the immortal for a while, he was able to establish the ten immortal sects. The skills of the great master who has been standing by his side are naturally unimaginably profound."</p><p></p><p>"Most of the Tian Du Purple Qi contains the insights of the great masters regarding the teachings of the immortal. It encompasses everything. Ordinary people only need a little of it to benefit for a lifetime."</p><p></p><p>"What I obtained initially was some insights from the great masters about refining tools." Fang Zaiji said, glancing towards the Source Dao Province.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan understood.</p><p></p><p>Initially, the immortal sects received direct guidance from the immortals.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Du Purple Qi is the comprehension of the great masters of Tian Du who have been listening to the immortal teachings for years. After a roundabout process, although weaker than the true immortal teachings, it is still sufficient to easily create a Taoist in the legendary realm.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1170</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan couldn't help but shake his head, awakening from his fantasy.</p><p></p><p>Even if he had the ability to analyze the fishing pool, Li Fan would not easily choose to take action. The terrifying scene of Senior Shi Ban being mysteriously fished away was still vivid in his mind, so how could Li Fan repeat the same mistake for a moment's small gain?</p><p></p><p>With the lesson from his 119th life, before he was confident in directly confronting an existence at the True Immortal level, he would never actively provoke Them again.</p><p></p><p>In any case, the treasures inside the fishing pool could be obtained by slowly and continuously fishing. At most, it would just be a bit slower, and time was what he lacked the least.</p><p></p><p>"If the [Immeasurable, Vast and Hazy Fang] Great Formation is derived, perhaps the Derivation Jade can be used for an initial test of effectiveness," the avatar secretly pondered after briefly checking on the situation of the true body.</p><p></p><p>In the space of the Derivation Jade, it seemed as if time had lost its meaning of existence.</p><p></p><p>Every day, what could be seen was the unchanging scene of the Derivation Light Sphere rotating non-stop. And the little Derivation Loli had slowly gotten used to Li Fan's intimidation, actually gradually becoming fearless. If it weren't for the other two Harmonized Dao guardians stationed there, Li Fan would definitely let her have a taste of his methods.</p><p></p><p>However, at present, it was not advisable to be too high-profile, so he had to endure a little.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Sun, calculate the time. In the next few days, a Dharma Transmitter should come to inspect. At that time, we still need to pay attention," Hua Yueye, who had been silent, suddenly remembered something and transmitted a reminder.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when taking office, he was indeed informed of the precautions regarding the regular inspections by the Dharma Transmitters. So Li Fan was not surprised and nodded to indicate his understanding.</p><p></p><p>"After the Dharma Transmitter completes the inspection, the use of the Dharma Audience Jade Tablet should be restarted. By then, it should become livelier here."</p><p></p><p>"Those who can come here and request the help of the Derivation Jade to derive techniques either have an illustrious family background or heaven-defying luck. In the end, their future achievements will definitely be extraordinary. While doing our job well, it doesn't hurt to leave a good connection. Maybe in a hundred years when we go out, we can make use of this relationship," Hua Yueye kindly pointed out.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Elder Zhang Xu also echoed, "That's the principle. In the hundreds of years, although the Derivation Jade space remains unchanged, the outside world may have already undergone drastic changes. Having one more path is always good."</p><p></p><p>Although they were already Harmonized Dao powerhouses, those who would come here to guard for five hundred years basically would not be the most core members of their families. Making preparations for the future was also reasonable.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later, the Dharma Transmitter came to inspect as scheduled.</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Lang, Li Fan had met this person once at the Dharma Transmitter Council.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the three guardians, Dharma Transmitter Lang came to the little Derivation Loli with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The little loli rolled her eyes, then covered her ears with both hands, looking as if she couldn't hear anything no matter what he said.</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Lang seemed to be accustomed to this and was not angered.</p><p></p><p>A row of silver needles appeared by his hand.</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Lang picked up one of them and then pierced it towards the Derivation Jade's head.</p><p></p><p>The little loli's body trembled slightly, but it seemed as if some force was restraining her. Unable to resist, she could only let the silver needles fall one by one on different acupuncture points of her body.</p><p></p><p>This seemingly very cruel scene made Zhang Xu</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Hua Yueye also didn't dare to speak.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan saw through some clues, his eyes flashing.</p><p></p><p>The acupuncture technique used by the Dharma Transmitter Lang was not for coercion or control.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was a top-notch healing method to help regulate qi and blood, and smooth the meridians. Indeed, after the Dharma Transmitter Lang waited for a short while and removed the needles, the complexion of the little loli Yanfa Jue looked much better.</p><p></p><p>Her little cheeks were rosy, as if she had just finished a strenuous exercise.</p><p></p><p>"Not only has she become healthier, but the components of her humanity have also become active again."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared at Yanfa Jue and, after careful observation, noticed the clues.</p><p></p><p>The thought of wanting to "slack off and rest" was probably a natural result of overwork.</p><p></p><p>It was not innate to her.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as time passed, this purely materialized sign became more and more obvious.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Dharma Transmitter needs to conduct regular inspections. This is to maintain Yanfa Jue's humanity."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, compared to a pure wonder, Yanfa Jue led by a simple little loli can exert better effects."</p><p></p><p>However, Yanfa Jue didn't show any good face to the Dharma Transmitter Lang who "helped" her.</p><p></p><p>She glared at the other party angrily until they left leisurely. Only then did Yanfa Jue suddenly slam the table, venting her dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Then she lay on the long table and fell into a deep sleep, snoring loudly.</p><p></p><p>The day after the inspection was Yanfa Jue's recuperation period, and she could rest freely.</p><p></p><p>The little loli slept sweetly, her snores shaking the heavens.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan noticed that the giant Yanfa light sphere on top of her head seemed to be rapidly changing and deducing something non-stop.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting," Li Fan mused.</p><p></p><p>Just as Hua Yueye had anticipated, once Yanfa Jue re-engaged in the endless work, the restrictions on the Jifa Jade Tablet were lifted.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the original deduction work, the little loli had to take on the additional task of deducing customized cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>No wonder she had a very bad attitude towards these Jifa seekers.</p><p></p><p>Except for a very few handsome cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The responsibilities of Li Fan and the three guardians of the Convergence Dao also simultaneously increased a bit.</p><p></p><p>After all, they had to be on constant alert for any malicious attacks from other forces among these Jifa seekers.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, this probability was not particularly high.</p><p></p><p>With the three Convergence Dao members working together to monitor, it should be safe and sound in the short term.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the void outside the small world of the Great Qi of the Holy Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Severing Grand Formation, originally used to separate mortals, had been transformed by Li Ping into a part of the Heaven and Earth Myriad Spirits Grand Formation.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping even specially tamed and cultivated a group of Void-Splitting Whales to re-open the void around the Great Qi small world, serving as a natural protective buffer.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the dark void that should have been empty, a huge creature hundreds of times larger than the Great Qi small world was hidden.</p><p></p><p>It was the Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven!</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Flowers Daoist did not disappoint. At the cost of almost falling into slumber again, he finally quietly transported it back without alarming the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was an ancient immortal, and his strength was still superior to ordinary Convergence Dao experts.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the reason why the mission could be so smooth was also due to Li Ping's assistance in concealing it with formations.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor Li Ping looked at the Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven from afar, sensing the Dao-One Insects that were frantically multiplying inside it, his face expressionless.</p>

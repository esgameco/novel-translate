        <h1>Chapter 329</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Instead, by feeling everything that happened to Lu Xuejing, he slowly comprehended the authority that belonged to the master.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... I can vaguely sense the scenes around her. I can also directly speak in her mind and give her orders."</p><p></p><p>"In this light, the previous communication talisman was actually redundant and would leave traces."</p><p></p><p>"It's better to take it back."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan flew slowly and leisurely to Lu Xuejing's side.</p><p></p><p>Suffering from long-term pain, her pretty face had turned as pale as a sheet of white paper.</p><p></p><p>Her whole body seemed as if it had just been fished out of water, drenched in sweat.</p><p></p><p>Her exquisite figure was faintly visible under the soaked transparent clothes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pressed his hands to control Lu Xuejing's trembling body, and his spiritual power flowed through her body.</p><p></p><p>Her body seemed to have no defense against him at all.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, Li Fan completed his exploration.</p><p></p><p>The girl no longer had any secrets in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>When he saw clearly the foundation-building wonder in Lu Xuejing's dantian, Li Fan couldn't help but sigh with emotion.</p><p></p><p>A snow-covered land frozen for thousands of miles.</p><p></p><p>One could even vaguely see the miniature scenes of many cities and villages.</p><p></p><p>A piece of information suddenly appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Earth Wonder: Winter Ice Crystal."</p><p></p><p>"As expected of a top-tier second-generation immortal of the Wanxian Alliance, not only can she lay the foundation at the age of 23, but her foundation-building wonder is also an earth wonder that matches her physique and cultivation method."</p><p></p><p>"The starting point of her life is already an existence that ordinary cultivators can never reach in their lifetimes."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, her mind is not very good..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes were icy cold, without the slightest intention of cherishing a beauty.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued his own research.</p><p></p><p>"There is only pure spiritual energy in her body, no other heterogeneous energy. There are also no traces of formations or restrictions..."</p><p></p><p>"The source of this pain..."</p><p></p><p>"It's as if the most basic settings of the body have been directly modified through the origin."</p><p></p><p>"Without a master, the foundation for life to continue is lost."</p><p></p><p>"This method is unimaginable."</p><p></p><p>Just as he was sighing inwardly, Lu Xuejing, who had been tortured for a long time, was getting weaker and weaker, and was about to die.</p><p></p><p>Almost only a step away from death, her struggling movements became weaker and weaker, and her pupils began to dilate.</p><p></p><p>"Master... save me." Suddenly, Lu Xuejing's voice sounded in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, perhaps driven by the instinct to survive, she finally completely submitted to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly and gently stroked the top of her head with his right hand.</p><p></p><p>"Hoo!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Xuejing's body suddenly arched up, as if she could finally breathe smoothly, panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, perhaps as an aftereffect of the long-term pain, after a period of time, her body fell quickly again.</p><p></p><p>She began to twitch irregularly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan never let go of his hand.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Lu Xuejing slowly returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>Her body and mind had reached their limits, and she fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>"Too young and immature, if she goes back like this, even if it concerns her own life, she will reveal flaws."</p><p></p><p>"Further guidance is needed."</p><p></p><p>Looking at Lu Xuejing, who was in a coma with an abnormal blush on her face, Li Fan withdrew his right hand and gently pointed at her brow.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Water Dream Technique, activate!</p><p></p><p>With the advancement to the Golden Core stage, the strength of his divine sense had a qualitative leap, and the dreams woven by Li Fan became more and more real.</p><p></p><p>In the repeated dream cycles, Li Fan, as the master, accompanied and guided Lu Xuejing to deal with various possible situations after returning.</p><p></p><p>And in these dreams woven mainly from Lu Xuejing's memories, Li Fan also had a general understanding of her mother, Lu Xichan.</p><p></p><p>Extremely domineering, with a strong desire for control.</p><p></p><p>She had set Lu Xuejing's path of cultivation early on.</p><p></p><p>Busy with official duties, her true self could not always accompany her child.</p><p></p><p>Her words were final, and she had no emotional communication with her child.</p><p></p><p>"If I hadn't intervened, the child would have been almost ruined."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head inwardly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When the sun set again, Lu Xuejing finally woke up from the endless dreams.</p><p></p><p>The confusion in her eyes gradually dissipated, and when she saw Li Fan, she subconsciously called out, "Master..."</p><p></p><p>But soon, she realized something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>A trace of panic flashed in her eyes, but her body had already formed instincts.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the pain just now, like falling into the Avici Hell, was still vivid.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xuejing couldn't muster the courage to resist at all.</p><p></p><p>After only a moment of hesitation, she turned over, knelt gracefully towards Li Fan, and touched her forehead to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Without Li Fan's order, she dared not move at all.</p><p></p><p>"You may go, patiently hide and cultivate, and wait for my orders." After a long time, Li Fan finally spoke.</p><p></p><p>"This slave understands." Lu Xuejing kowtowed again.</p><p></p><p>Then she got up and flew away, her actions showing no panic, and her face regained the previous arrogant expression.</p><p></p><p>"With Lu Xuejing's cooperation, my chances of entering the Five Elements Grand Cavern have greatly increased. Whether it can succeed still depends on how things develop."</p><p></p><p>"However, the necessary preparations still need to be made."</p><p></p><p>Watching Lu Xuejing's disappearing figure, Li Fan's body also turned into a streak of light and returned to Tianyu City after a while.</p><p></p><p>Before cultivating, Li Fan first searched for information about Guan Xingxiu, the commander of the Tianyu State Garrison.</p><p></p><p>When Ji Hongdao uncharacteristically let him leave before, he had told him that he didn't need to worry about accidents happening anymore.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Li Fan had a premonition that this commander's end might not be very good.</p><p></p><p>As expected, after a look.</p><p></p><p>First, he was removed from office and investigated.</p><p></p><p>Then a conclusion was quickly reached: stripping a major realm of cultivation and exiling him to the remote Lanlin State in the south.</p><p></p><p>The punishment was quite heavy.</p><p></p><p>In addition to Guan Xingxiu, two other commanders also received severe punishments.</p><p></p><p>Although not as cruel as having their cultivation stripped, they were also removed from their posts and had no chance of becoming the chief commander of the garrison.</p><p></p><p>"This is using thunderous means to tell the people below the determination to build the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation this time."</p><p></p><p>"Whether you are wronged or the plotter of a conspiracy. As long as you are involved in this matter, you will be severely punished."</p><p></p><p>"Using some conspiracies and tricks to compete for the position of chief commander. Acceptable."</p><p></p><p>"But hindering the construction progress of the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation. Not acceptable."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"With the unexpected withdrawal of the three candidates, the successor to the next chief commander has basically become clear."</p><p></p><p>"The one who was originally the least favored, and even he himself didn't take the election seriously before, can be said to have won by lying down..."</p><p></p><p>"From Tianyun State, LÃ¼ Junyi."</p><p></p><p>"Tianyun State..."</p><p></p><p>Recalling that He Zhenghao is now serving in the Tianyun State Garrison, the so-called one person attains the Dao and even the dogs ascend to heaven.</p><p></p><p>I wonder if he will get any benefits from this.</p>

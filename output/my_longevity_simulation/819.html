        <h1>Chapter 819</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Apart from the fact that the terrain of the Nine Mountains Prefecture was treacherous, the transmission array was ineffective, and cultivators below the Nascent Soul stage could not fly over the mountains and rivers. The complete betrayal of the Ling Yuan Sect was also an important reason why the attacks of the Myriad Immortals Alliance repeatedly failed.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown what benefits the Five Elders Council had promised the Ling Yuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>Under the rule of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, this organization had been fickle many times. After being brought under the control of the Five Elders Council, it was as if their nature had completely changed, becoming absolutely loyal.</p><p></p><p>They even tied up several lobbyists who had secretly infiltrated the Myriad Immortals Alliance on the spot and handed them over.</p><p></p><p>To show their absolute loyalty.</p><p></p><p>With the setback in the attack on the Nine Mountains Prefecture, the Myriad Immortals Alliance changed its strategy accordingly.</p><p></p><p>From offense to defense.</p><p></p><p>In the bordering prefectures, they withdrew heavy troops to defend.</p><p></p><p>Even the protective formations were activated to cover the entire prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Element Creation Formation..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked up at the sky that had turned earthy yellow and the spiritual energy around him that was being withdrawn from time to time, and narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The protective grand formation of the Myriad Immortals Alliance indeed has some tricks. It's just a pity that it's far inferior to the Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation. With my Separation Disc in hand, it can be broken in an instant." Many scenes flashed through his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, with Li Fan lightly making a hand seal and casting a spell, it was as if a vacuum appeared around him.</p><p></p><p>The function of the Heavenly Element Creation Formation to extract the spiritual energy of heaven and earth lost its effect near Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>More crucially, no one noticed any abnormality at all.</p><p></p><p>"With the Myriad Immortals Alliance activating the protective grand formation, under normal circumstances, it's not something the Five Elders Council can break through in a short time."</p><p></p><p>"The war may soon reach a stalemate, and then slowly subside in people's oblivion..."</p><p></p><p>"No, no! Let me lend you a helping hand again!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan laughed lightly, and his figure flew like a ghost towards the border of Shilin Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>He didn't pass through the defensive line to go to the Nine Mountains Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he arrived near a border town called [Heshi], not far from the White Mist Barrier.</p><p></p><p>A squad of cultivators from the Martial Arts Hall of the Myriad Immortals Alliance was stationed in the town.</p><p></p><p>The garrison commander of Heshi also accompanied them with a very tense expression, inspecting the specific situation of the formations, restrictions and other defensive measures.</p><p></p><p>Without alarming the defenders, Li Fan sneaked into the town.</p><p></p><p>When they finally separated, he quietly found the garrison commander of Heshi.</p><p></p><p>The garrison commander was named Yu Dayi, who had just reached the Golden Core stage.</p><p></p><p>With a big belly, he looked very honest and kind.</p><p></p><p>He had just taken a break and was drinking a cup of spiritual tea to relax. Suddenly, he saw Li Fan appear in front of him without any sign.</p><p></p><p>His face changed and he was about to call out.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you, sir?" Yu Dayi asked, narrowing his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Worlds United Association, you should know about it, right?" Li Fan deliberately said in a strange voice.</p><p></p><p>Yu Dayi's face changed instantly again, but he was very cautious and didn't admit it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan kept looking up and down at Yu Dayi and said with a strange laugh, "Being infiltrated and full of holes, the Myriad Immortals Alliance indeed shows signs of imminent destruction!"</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's words, the aura on Yu Dayi's body instantly became elusive and dangerous.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry. Apart from our Myriad Worlds United Association, no one else knows your identity as a spy of the Five Elders Council." Li Fan glanced at the other party and said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Yu Dayi finally stopped pretending.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know how he was exposed, Yu Dayi still maintained the basic qualities of a spy and calmly responded.</p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Dui: "Sir, what exactly is the reason for your visit..."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't it because your Five Elders Society has disappointed us greatly? Having occupied the Nine Mountains State, you should have seized the momentum and attacked, annexing several more states. How can you be satisfied with this and not make a move?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Dayi's expression turned somewhat unpleasant: "Sir, you don't really think that the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals is easy to deal with, do you? This successful surprise attack on the Nine Mountains State was also the result of detailed planning. Don't you see how strict the border defenses are here? Just the protective great formation covering the entire state is not easy to break through."</p><p></p><p>"Heh, the weak always like to make excuses for themselves. Or, are you afraid of that Dharma Heavenly Venerable, and that's why you have been hesitating to take thorough action?" Li Fan glanced at Yu Dayi and said with a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for a response, Li Fan continued to speak as he pleased: "But your concerns are also correct. Now is indeed not the time for a major offensive."</p><p></p><p>"However, it wouldn't hurt to go a little further and expand the results of the war a bit more, which wouldn't provoke the Dharma Heavenly Venerable to take action."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Li Fan tossed a jade slip over.</p><p></p><p>Yu Dayi reacted quickly, catching it and examining it closely.</p><p></p><p>He could no longer maintain his composure: "The weakness of the Tianyuan Transformation Formation?"</p><p></p><p>He looked at Li Fan, his eyes full of shock: "This..."</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's true or false, you'll know once you try. I just hope you have the guts." Li Fan smiled sinisterly.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for a response, his figure flashed and disappeared from the other party's sight.</p><p></p><p>Yu Dayi gripped the jade slip tightly, his face alternating between gloom and joy.</p><p></p><p>This cultivator who called himself a member of the Multiverse Alliance had a mysterious background. His tone was even more frighteningly arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he know about his undercover identity, but he also knew clearly about the top-secret protective great formation of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yu Dayi fell into hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"With the current strict frontline defenses, the only way to succeed is to abandon this hard-earned identity."</p><p></p><p>After some deliberation, Yu Dayi carefully read the contents of the jade slip again.</p><p></p><p>Then, he came alone to a quiet place in the city, facing the Tianyuan Transformation Formation that enveloped the state.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, Yu Dayi's expression remained unchanged on the surface.</p><p></p><p>In fact, his body had already begun to tremble slightly uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>It was due to excitement.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually true." Yu Dayi took a deep breath, suppressing the excitement in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He carried out normal activities with a calm demeanor.</p><p></p><p>Until three days later, seizing a rare opportunity, he left Heshi City under the pretext of an excuse.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slowly revealed his figure.</p><p></p><p>"I hope the Five Elders Society won't disappoint me."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yu Dayi's mysterious disappearance quickly drew the attention of the Yanwu Hall cultivators stationed in the city.</p><p></p><p>By the time they confirmed that he had indeed defected and urgently sent out a wanted notice to the border,</p><p></p><p>Yu Dayi had already successfully returned to the Nine Mountains State and found the organization.</p><p></p><p>After only a brief calm of half a month,</p><p></p><p>Before the spy incident in Heshi City and the accountability process of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals could even be completed, the Five Elders Society's stormy attacks quickly arrived.</p><p></p><p>It was not only Shilin State.</p><p></p><p>War broke out simultaneously along all the border lines.</p><p></p><p>The protective formation that the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals relied heavily upon was completely useless, as if it were just for show.</p><p></p><p>Caught off guard, the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals suffered heavy losses.</p><p></p><p>In less than seven days, news came of several states being lost.</p><p></p><p>Shilin State, due to the garrison of heavy troops, was still resisting with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>The change in the war situation was beyond everyone's expectations.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Immortal Alliance were instantly filled with panic and unease.</p>

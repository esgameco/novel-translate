            <p>As the students were excitedly staring at the Dissociation Discs and discussing among themselves, Ji Hongdao continued, "The strength of the Dissociation Discs lies in their growth potential."</p><p></p><p>After finishing his sentence, Ji Hongdao deliberately paused, waiting for the students' reaction. As he expected, once these words were spoken, everyone immediately erupted in excitement.</p><p></p><p>It is well known that in the world of cultivation, if any magical treasure is associated with growth potential, its value will skyrocket tenfold or even a hundredfold.</p><p></p><p>Originally, as a secondary product of the Heavenly Profound Mirror, this Dissociation Disc with its ability to break formations was already very precious.</p><p></p><p>If it also possesses growth potential, its value will be immeasurable! The students looked at Ji Hongdao with burning eyes, waiting for his explanation.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that he had piqued everyone's interest, Ji Hongdao no longer kept them in suspense and said, "We formation masters all have a long-cherished wish in our hearts - to create a perfect formation that belongs to us. The Dissociation Disc can help us achieve this."</p><p></p><p>"Every time a formation is broken, the Dissociation Disc will absorb and store the formation data within itself."</p><p></p><p>"According to our research and observations, after this, the Dissociation Disc will spontaneously extrapolate the absorbed formations, trying to repair the loopholes used in the previous process of breaking the formation."</p><p></p><p>"When the flaws are repaired, a brand new formation is born."</p><p></p><p>"Subsequently, the Dissociation Disc will attempt to break this new formation again." "Breaking - repairing - breaking again."</p><p></p><p>"A formation in the hands of an ordinary formation master often takes several years or even more than a decade to go through one iteration."</p><p></p><p>"With this Dissociation Disc, it can achieve several iterations in a year's time." "Of course, this efficiency is also related to the difficulty of the formation being broken."</p><p></p><p>"If it's a formation of the level of the Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation, then the iteration efficiency will naturally slow down."</p><p></p><p>"However, even so, the Dissociation Disc's efficiency is still higher than all of us combined."</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao praised, without any resentment of being surpassed by a magical treasure. He couldn't help but touch the treasure in his hand again, and continued, "The more formation data the Dissociation Disc absorbs, the stronger its breaking ability will become. Similarly, its extrapolation and iteration capabilities will also become increasingly powerful."</p><p></p><p>"It's hard to imagine how far they will grow in the future."</p><p></p><p>"It is said that our Myriad Immortals Alliance's supreme treasure, the Heavenly Profound Mirror, was also just an ordinary mirror in the beginning."</p><p></p><p>"It was only after witnessing the Immortal Venerable's transmission of teachings and gaining self-awareness that it gradually became as profound as it is today through thousands of years of continuous growth."</p><p></p><p>"So, who knows if the Dissociation Disc in your hands will evolve into a second Heavenly Profound Mirror?" As soon as these words were spoken, all the students held their breath.</p><p></p><p>There was no way around it. Everyone belonging to the Myriad Immortals Alliance knew the power and preciousness of the Heavenly Profound Mirror. Thinking that they might possess a magical treasure comparable to the Heavenly Profound Mirror in the future, everyone's breathing couldn't help but quicken after a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Ji, don't tease us anymore. Quickly announce the results!" The speaker was a Golden Core cultivator named Qi Chengcheng. In the previous assessment, he had ranked at the top in every subject.</p><p></p><p>He had absolute confidence in his performance and believed that he would definitely get one of the nine Dissociation Discs, so he impatiently urged.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, on the other hand, carefully savored Ji Hongdao's words and felt a different taste.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, this Dissociation Disc was indeed an extraordinary treasure.</p><p></p><p>If Ji Hongdao had not exaggerated, it was basically what Zhang Zhiliang had been looking forward to - the perfect lower-level substitute for the Heavenly Profound Mirror and the core of the Infinite Law.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also admitted that he was tempted. However, Ji Hongdao's motivational speech was a bit odd.</p><p></p><p>If he had said these words at the beginning of the training to motivate them, it would have been understandable.</p><p></p><p>But now that the final assessment had ended and the results had been determined, logically speaking, the ownership of the nine Dissociation Discs should have already been settled. Why did Ji Hongdao still say such provocative words? What was his intention?</p><p></p><p>He even brought up "who knows if it will become a second Heavenly Profound Mirror".</p><p></p><p>If Li Fan hadn't known that the Heavenly Profound Mirror was likely related to the supreme treasure of the ancient Profound Heaven Sect, the Profound Heaven Mirror, he would have almost believed Ji Hongdao's nonsense.</p><p></p><p>And just as Li Fan expected, after a slight smile, Ji Hongdao revealed his true intentions. With a light wave of his hand, a golden light list appeared on the sky screen.</p><p></p><p>On the golden list, from top to bottom, according to the ranking of the results, the names of everyone were written in order. The top nine names even emitted a faint purple-golden light, making them particularly eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>While opening the golden list, Ji Hongdao also said, "I had promised before that these nine Dissociation Discs would be given as rewards to the top performers in this assessment."</p><p></p><p>"This matter was personally approved by the headquarters of the Formation Strategy Hall, so naturally, we will not go back on our word." "However..." "The situation has changed."</p><p></p><p>At this point, a hint of helplessness appeared on Ji Hongdao's face. Everyone looked at each other, feeling a sense of unease rising in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Initially, there were indeed nine Dissociation Discs. Even now, the number is still the same. But just yesterday, we suddenly discovered that among these nine Dissociation Discs, eight of them had dimmed slightly."</p><p></p><p>"While the other one, its light did not diminish but instead increased, becoming a bit stronger."</p><p></p><p>"Although the degree of this change was extremely subtle, we still noticed it."</p><p></p><p>"The secondary products of the Heavenly Profound Mirror often have hidden characteristics unknown to others, which only manifest at specific times. So we didn't discover the true mystery of these Dissociation Discs before..."</p><p></p><p>"This matter is indeed our oversight." Ji Hongdao sighed, his old face turning red. The students, however, understood the meaning behind Ji Hongdao's words.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Ji, do you mean that these nine Dissociation Discs will devour each other?" Qi Chengcheng couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao nodded, "After noticing the anomaly, through careful research, we discovered that these seemingly nine Dissociation Discs are actually one entity."</p><p></p><p>"Whenever the [Dissociation] ability of one of them becomes stronger, it will seize the essence from the other sub-entities to strengthen itself."</p><p></p><p>"As for the weaker ones, if they stay in place and don't catch up, their own essence and power will be continuously absorbed, becoming weaker and weaker until they eventually disappear."</p><p></p><p>"This is called the strong get stronger, and the weak get weaker."</p><p></p><p>"In the end, in the constant competition among the nine Dissociation Discs, only one can survive."</p><p></p><p>"And it will be the biggest winner, possessing the combined power of all nine Dissociation Discs."</p>

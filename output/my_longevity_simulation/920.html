        <h1>Chapter 920</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Sister Zhao was right. The "Reverse Ethics Scripture" was indeed a unique and extraordinary cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>The scripture believed that the operation of heaven and earth followed established rules. And to maintain the rotation of these rules required a powerful driving force.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating in accordance with the Dao of Heaven could certainly achieve the highest realm. But reversing these rules could also allow one to glimpse the realm of true immortals.</p><p></p><p>The principles of heaven and earth were so vast! How could human power achieve this?</p><p></p><p>Male was yang, female was yin. If a man could cultivate a pure yin body, he would be able to take the first step in reversing the principles of heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>Using this as a starting point, one could continuously pry open the rules and order between heaven and earth, turning them into nourishment for one's own transcendence!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Qing read with fascination, captivated by the scenes described in the scripture where, after cultivating the "Reverse Ethics Scripture" to the later stages, one could change heaven and earth with a mere gesture.</p><p></p><p>Seeing him so engrossed, Sister Zhao did not disturb him the whole time. She quietly watched Li Qing's profile, her expression dazed.</p><p></p><p>Only when Li Qing finally came back to his senses did Zhao Ruoxi hand over another storage ring: "For the next period of time, you'll have to rely on yourself first."</p><p></p><p>"Although they were just outer sect disciples, I still broke the sect rules by arbitrarily killing them. Punishment is unavoidable."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the worry in Li Qing's eyes, Sister Zhao comforted: "It's alright, it's just ten years of seclusion. I'll take this opportunity to diligently cultivate."</p><p></p><p>"When I emerge from seclusion, I will definitely kill Qin Shou for you and avenge your hatred!"</p><p></p><p>"During this time, you must not abandon yourself to despair. The origins of this Reverse Ethics Scripture are mysterious. Even my master has never heard of this cultivation method in the secret pavilion, as if it appeared out of thin air."</p><p></p><p>"Cultivate well. In the future, your realm may even surpass mine."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Today's parting would mean not seeing each other for ten years.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ruoxi was reluctant to part, as if there were endless things to say.</p><p></p><p>Until late into the night, in the flickering candlelight, Zhao Ruoxi and Li Qing's fingers were interlocked as they gazed into each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ruoxi's eyelashes trembled slightly as she looked at Li Qing's flawless white skin and tender pink lips.</p><p></p><p>A heat involuntarily rose in her heart.</p><p></p><p>A different kind of affection silently spread. Zhao Ruoxi tightly grasped Li Qing's hand and gently kissed it.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing felt as if struck by electricity and instinctively wanted to push Zhao Ruoxi away. </p><p></p><p>As if sensing what the other was thinking, Zhao Ruoxi did not let go, but resolutely embraced Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>"It's okay..."</p><p></p><p>"No matter what you become, as long as it's you, it's fine."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ruoxi said softly, as if to express her feelings, she guided Li Qing's hand to reach towards her chest.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the other's heartbeat and seeing Sister Zhao's affectionate gaze, Li Qing finally gave up struggling.</p><p></p><p>Sister Zhao flicked her finger to extinguish the candle while setting up a prohibition around to prevent others from barging in.</p><p></p><p>Embracing Li Qing, they moved to the bed.</p><p></p><p>The passion of the night need not be described in detail.</p><p></p><p>The next day, when Li Qing awoke, Zhao Ruoxi had already left.</p><p></p><p>Only the lingering fragrance in the air proved that last night's scene was not a dream.</p><p></p><p>"So it turns out you can make love even without that thing down there."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing thought, somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>But soon, his attention shifted from those enchanting scenes.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he began to examine the "Reverse Ethics Scripture" that he had abruptly entered.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Li Qing had a realization: "Perhaps it was yesterday's behavior that completed my initial transformation from yang to yin."</p><p></p><p>"So the Nilun Scripture has also taken its first step."</p><p></p><p>"I also suddenly broke through from the middle stage of Qi Refining to the late stage."</p><p></p><p>"The progress is actually so fast..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's eyes flashed, not knowing what she was thinking.</p><p></p><p>"Qin Shou..."</p><p></p><p>A figure suddenly appeared in Li Qing's mind.</p><p></p><p>"I will avenge myself personally!"</p><p></p><p>"You'd better not die before I achieve great success in my divine techniques. Hehehe..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's low laughter echoed in the room.</p><p></p><p>From then on, in the eyes of the outer sect disciples, it seemed that earth-shattering changes had taken place in Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>Her personality changed greatly, and she had less and less contact with the male disciples of the outer sect. Instead, she became close with those female cultivators, and their relationship got better and better.</p><p></p><p>And the female disciples all knew about his experience of being dismembered of his "tool", so they had no guard against him.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, they pitied him and took extra care of Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>So they became more and more familiar with each other.</p><p></p><p>Later, Li Qing directly moved to the courtyard where the female cultivators lived, taking turns sleeping in the same bed with them.</p><p></p><p>And in this process, Li Qing's physique, appearance, and even voice became more and more feminine.</p><p></p><p>Whenever his graceful figure walked through the mountain gate, it attracted the eyes of countless male cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Even knowing that he was a man, it was impossible to stop their natural admiration for beauty.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing was just ice-cold to these male cultivators, showing no favor.</p><p></p><p>In this way, a year passed.</p><p></p><p>Deep in a hidden cave in the outer sect mountains.</p><p></p><p>"This place is where the yin energy is most abundant in the outer sect mountains."</p><p></p><p>"It's just right to help me break through today."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing sat naked on a piece of black jade on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power in his body, which was as cold as a thousand-year-old ice, circulated slowly, freezing the already very cold surroundings with layers of white frost.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Qing himself did not expect that his cultivation of this Nilun Scripture would be so smooth.</p><p></p><p>As if this technique was tailor-made for him, in just one short year, he broke through from the late stage of Qi Refining to the late stage of Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>Today, he even wants to take advantage of the geographical location to directly challenge the Golden Core realm!</p><p></p><p>He didn't even dare to think about this kind of cultivation speed before!</p><p></p><p>It even made him a little scared in his heart.</p><p></p><p>During this period, he had not exposed his true cultivation level, for fear of being investigated by the Dadao Sect.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the reason why it was so smooth was also due to the contributions of the group of female cultivators in the outer sect.</p><p></p><p>In this year, all the virgins with some looks among them had their yin energy absorbed by Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>Even relying on the [Nilun Scripture], these female cultivators were still devoted to him and grateful.</p><p></p><p>Not only did they try their best to please him in bed, they even wanted to dedicate all their savings accumulated over a long time to Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>With the wholehearted assistance of the female cultivators in the outer sect, Li Qing lived much more prosperously than before.</p><p></p><p>He lacked nothing, whether it was spirit stones or elixirs.</p><p></p><p>The superposition of various factors led to his rapid progress.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there was only one last trace of yang energy left in Li Qing's body.</p><p></p><p>As long as it was transformed into yin energy, he could completely realize the transformation from a male body to a [pure yin body].</p><p></p><p>The [Nilun Scripture] could also be considered as initially mastered.</p><p></p><p>Concentrating, Li Qing absorbed the rolling yin energy from the black jade he sat on and the deep cave in the mountains.</p><p></p><p>He silently operated the [Nilun Scripture], and the scenes of the past flashed one by one in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"After today, I will completely say goodbye to the past."</p>

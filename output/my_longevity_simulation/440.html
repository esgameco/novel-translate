C·¥è·¥ç</p><p></p><p>In just over two months, this speed is faster than his previous life.</p><p></p><p>What happened?</p><p></p><p>After checking the surveillance footage of He Zhenhao saved in the Stone Crystal of the Transcendence Avenue, Li Fan couldn't help but chuckle dumbfoundedly.</p><p></p><p>Lately, He Zhenhao was truly in high spirits.</p><p></p><p>Due to receiving guidance from senior members of the Heavenly Opportunity Sect, news of his overturning fate spread like wildfire in the Cloud Sea.</p><p></p><p>Due to cultivating the "Mountain Meditation Technique" before, He Zhenhao had long started building good relationships and expanding his network because of his talent in array formations, his relationship with the Array Hall's array formation masters was also quite good.</p><p></p><p>So, despite He Zhenhao being just a foundational establishment cultivator, his network of interpersonal relationships was not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, it was all thanks to He Zhenhao that Li Fan was able to join the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance!</p><p></p><p>This time, by chance, He Zhenhao modified his foundational law technique to one that suited him extremely well.</p><p></p><p>Keen observers could see that as long as nothing major happened, He Zhenhao reaching the Core Formation realm was almost a certainty.</p><p></p><p>A Core Formation level array master, as well as a skilled socialite.</p><p></p><p>Now, He Zhenhao's position in the eyes of others had truly changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Visitors kept pouring in, and He Zhenhao welcomed them all warmly with a smile. new 69 Book Bar ùü®ùü´s ú·¥úx.·¥Ñ·¥è·¥ç</p><p></p><p>Receiving numerous gifts, he felt extremely elated.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation also improved by leaps and bounds, and soon he broke through to the late foundational establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>During this process, the visiting cultivators couldn't help but inquire about the ancient Heavenly Opportunity Sect cultivator related to He Zhenhao.</p><p></p><p>After all, overnight, his value had doubled.</p><p></p><p>Who wouldn't envy such good fortunes?</p><p></p><p>If only they could also latch onto this great opportunity...</p><p></p><p>Initially, He Zhenhao could make do with excuses like "I've been out of contact with him for a long time, and I haven't seen that senior since." </p><p></p><p>But as the number of inquiring cultivators increased, with higher statuses, He Zhenhao gradually found it hard to cope.</p><p></p><p>Because he was adamant about not revealing the slightest information about the Heavenly Opportunity Sect cultivator, it started to irk some cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Accusations of He Zhenhao hogging everything for himself also began to surface.</p><p></p><p>Even the former Seneschal Hall Core Formation cultivator, Chu Ming, who helped Li Fan join the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance but had been unable to reach Li Fan, also began to ask about He Zhenhao.</p><p></p><p>Alas, poor He Zhenhao truly had no idea where Li Fan had gone!</p><p></p><p>Unable to reach him through the Celestial Mirror.</p><p></p><p>And not a trace left by the communication talisman.</p><p></p><p>Under the increasing pressure from cultivators, He Zhenhao was truly on the brink of tears. new 69 Book Bar ùü®ùü´s ú·¥úx.·¥Ñ·¥è·¥ç</p><p></p><p>He almost wanted to give his self from two months ago a slap.</p><p></p><p>Letting you strut around showing off without a care in the world!</p><p></p><p>Watching the constant inquiries from He Zhenhao in the Celestial Mirror, Li Fan's lips curved into a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>After another period of gestation, the situation would be almost settled.</p><p></p><p>Five million contribution points are enough to kickstart the first phase of the plan.</p><p></p><p>But for now, let's let Daoist He bear the brunt once more.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also sensed the situation from Master Fan's side.</p><p></p><p>Li Chenfeng had returned.</p><p></p><p>With him, there was a veiled woman in a green dress.</p><p></p><p>Li Chenfeng and the two others showed utmost respect to this woman, referring to her as the "Holy Teacher."</p><p></p><p>Since arriving in the Xuanhuang Realm, this teacher had never left the secluded chamber on the island.</p><p></p><p>When Li Chenfeng entered the chamber, Li Fan could see her manipulating a device similar to an orrery inside the chamber.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Teacher?</p><p></p><p>Interesting. Since the agreed-upon three months were up, let this "Ambassador of the Multiverse Union" pay her a visit.</p><p></p><p>From this woman in green, Li Fan did not sense any danger.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he felt a faint sense of familiarity coming from her.</p><p></p><p>This further piqued Li Fan's curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Changing back to his appearance from that day, he flew towards the target location.</p><p></p><p>In no time, he arrived in the sky above the island.</p><p></p><p>Looking closely, Li Chenfeng and the others were already waiting at the door.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please come with us," Li Chenfeng said softly, leading Li Fan into the chamber.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan appeared calm on the surface but was slightly wary inside.</p><p></p><p>Staring at the woman sitting not far away, whose face was unclear, he asked, "Who is she?"</p><p></p><p>"I am here on the Empress's orders to see if the so-called 'Immortal Ruins' are real," although the woman in green called herself elderly, her voice was crisp and melodious, akin to that of a teenager.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Is that so? Have you figured it out?" Li Fan looked interestedly at the device in front of the woman.</p><p></p><p>A golden sphere in the center was immobile, surrounded by many spheres of different colors moving irregularly in various orbits around it.</p><p></p><p>Shaking her head with a sigh, the woman in green said, "It seems something is concealing the 'Immortal Ruins,' making it impossible to detect."</p><p></p><p>However, things have indeed become even more extraordinary here.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted slightly, "Even more extraordinary here?"</p><p></p><p>With a wave of her hand, the woman stored the device.</p><p></p><p>This device, known as the "Virtual Spatial Latitude and Longitude Positioning Device," took the Empire thousands of years to complete and can mark and lock in one's position in the endless void. It also maps the surrounding environment.</p><p></p><p>Originally designed for escaping the Xuanhuang Realm and navigating the void, now it was repurposed to detect the "Immortal Ruins," making it quite versatile.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan listened quietly as the woman in green spoke.</p><p></p><p>Here, in the main world of the Xuanhuang Realm... a hint of nostalgia flashed in the woman's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The data mapped by the positioning device was all chaotic.</p><p></p><p>It was as if there were tremendous distortions present around, affecting time and space, disrupting the mapping results.</p><p></p><p>The observational results theoretically validate what you said, about the existence of that devouring 'Immortal Ruins.'</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said coldly, "I have no need to deceive you in this regard."</p><p></p><p>With a smirk, the woman in green said, "No, you did deceive us indeed."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes narrowed slightly, and his heart suddenly tensed.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>Looking up at the sky of the Xuanhuang Realm, the woman in green said slowly, "Because even if the 'Immortal Ruins' truly exists, once we, the Empire, depart from the Xuanhuang Realm, it won't devour us."</p><p></p><p>Not just us, the many small worlds captured by the ten major Immortal Dao Sects won't be devoured either.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Continuing, the woman in green said, "Because we are not even in the same time and space as the Xuanhuang Realm, simply connected by the Supreme Void Channels."</p><p></p><p>If we sever ties with the Xuanhuang Realm, we will gain complete freedom.</p>

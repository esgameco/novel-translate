        <div class="content">
            <p>"Even if the two immortal lords, Hongxi and Ziyun, return, wanting to move Master Mi, they also need to consider the consequences of doing so."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, Master is indeed very cautious, taking one step at a time and considering a hundred steps, which we cannot speculate on."</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, what seemed like a simple financial plan had so many twists and turns, causing He Zhenghao to sigh involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>Both of them deeply admired.</p><p></p><p>However, they had no idea that they overlooked the most crucial aspect of this seemingly plausible plan.</p><p></p><p>That is, whether Li Fan, after absorbing a large amount of contribution points, could really achieve a rate of return of 'two hundred percent in five years.'</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because Li Fan had demonstrated miraculous abilities before, which had unconsciously brainwashed them.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps the version of Li Fan they imagined was a fallen Tianzun, which made their trust in Li Fan's abilities nearly unquestioning.</p><p></p><p>In any case, they had no doubts that Li Fan could achieve the goal of this fundraising plan.</p><p></p><p>But tripling in five years?</p><p></p><p>How could it possibly stump the respected Master Mi?</p><p></p><p>But in reality...</p><p></p><p>Seriously speaking, even if Li Fan had reincarnated from the sea of clouds for several lifetimes and knew the situation well, this time he really couldn't do it.</p><p></p><p>It was not that he was incompetent, but when assets inflated to a certain extent, wanting to double them again would exponentially increase the difficulty.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, Li Fan was just a speculator who earned profits by buying and selling at different prices, not a creator of wealth.</p><p></p><p>He was not like the Immortal Alliance, able to generate contribution points endlessly without restrictions.</p><p></p><p>Under his operation, tens of millions in contribution points might be able to double, albeit barely.</p><p></p><p>But if it was hundreds of millions, even billions...</p><p></p><p>Unless there was another earth-shattering war between the Immortal Alliance and the Five Elders, and he could foresee it as well.</p><p></p><p>But not being able to achieve it didn't matter.</p><p></p><p>After all, from the beginning, he had no intention of fulfilling the promised profits.</p><p></p><p>That's why this fundraising had to be sealed for five years.</p><p></p><p>After five years, the Red Flame would burn the sea, and the Sea of Clouds would become a dead zone.</p><p></p><p>If they all died, there would be no need to repay those debts.</p><p></p><p>Instead of waiting for them to pass away and the Immortal Alliance to reclaim the contribution points, it was better to let Li Fan make waste use of them.</p><p></p><p>That's why Li Fan had no psychological pressure at all.</p><p></p><p>As for the return of Langan and Haoxuan Immortal Lords, as well as a group of infant stage cultivators, although it was indeed a fact, it was just a story used to deceive He and Gao. Whether they returned or not, Li Fan really didn't care about it.</p><p></p><p>As long as they dared to return to the Sea of Clouds, they would probably not escape death.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan actually hoped that Zhang Zhiliang and other familiar formation masters could survive this era longer.</p><p></p><p>Various thoughts flashed through his mind, and at this moment, "Zhou Qing'ang" once again said to He Zhenghao and Gao Yuan, "You two have already disappointed Master Mi once, do not waste the last chance to restore your reputation!"</p><p></p><p>"You must handle Master Mi's plan for this time properly."</p><p></p><p>Both nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>They both understood that if the two immortal lords returned and Li Fan fell from power, as Li Fan's direct lineages promoted by him, their fate would definitely be terrible.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of their loyalty, even for their own future, they had to work hard and take this seriously this time.</p><p></p><p>However, Gao Yuan was still more cautious.</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a while, before leaving, he cautiously asked Zhou Qing'ang, "Friend Zhou, do you have the credentials from Master Mi?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not that we don't trust you, but this is a matter of great importance..."</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing'ang" smiled faintly, about to respond.</p><p></p><p>Two strange fluctuations suddenly emitted from the storage rings of He Zhenghao and Gao Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The two remembered something and their faces changed.</p><p></p><p>They hurriedly took out the source of the disturbance, the two jade slips that Li Fan had given them before he closed his door.</p><p></p><p>The two jade slips flew into the air and merged into one.</p><p></p><p>In the faint figure, Li Fan's voice sounded, "You're right. This matter is indeed important, and I need to show my face."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan suddenly appearing, both He Zhenghao and Gao Yuan were flustered.</p><p></p><p>They immediately fell to the ground and saluted, "Respectful greetings to Master Mi!"</p><p></p><p>Their hearts were in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Even from when Master was in seclusion, their every move was under his control!</p><p></p><p>The two were extremely fearful, bowing their heads and not daring to look up without Li Fan's orders.</p><p></p><p>"He Zhenghao!"</p><p></p><p>"Here!" He Zhenghao answered promptly.</p><p></p><p>"Select some of the cultivators who were previously involved in the fundraising plan to represent you. I will meet them in ten days."</p><p></p><p>"Personally explain this five-year plan and reassure your minds as well," Li Fan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan entrusting them with orders, He Zhenghao was pleased and agreed on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Gao Yuan!"</p><p></p><p>"Here!" Gao Yuan's voice trembled a bit as he replied.</p><p></p><p>"Organize a list of the Sea of Clouds cultivators who fell during the recent battle in Tianlingzhou. Deliver it to me in ten days."</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan also quickly agreed.</p><p></p><p>The light on the split spirit jade slips in the air dimmed more and more, eventually becoming barely visible.</p><p></p><p>With a soft click, they fell to the ground, accompanied by Li Fan's final words, "Remember, in my absence, Zhou Qing'ang can be my full representative."</p><p></p><p>"His words are my orders!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang slightly lowered his head, expressing his gratitude repeatedly to Master Mi, with a hint of undisguised satisfaction on his lips.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, He Zhenghao and Gao Yuan couldn't help but feel a sourness and regret in their hearts: "Originally, this trust from Master Mi should have belonged to me!"</p><p></p><p>But they didn't dare to complain and nodded in compliance.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan personally appearing, it proved that Zhou Qing'ang's plan was true.</p><p></p><p>After this reprimand, both He and Gao, driven by Li Fan's will, obediently carried out their tasks meticulously.</p><p></p><p>After years of management, the control He and Gao had over the Sea of Clouds was actually more effective than Li Fan's.</p><p></p><p>Under their manipulation, the great battle was about to end, and a new fundraising plan was about to begin. These two events were almost spread throughout the Sea of Clouds cultivator community within a single day, causing a huge sensation and stirring many hearts.</p><p></p><p>Countless messages were sent to He Zhenghao, inquiring about the truth of the matter.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, He Zhenghao embellished the story.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, ten days later, a group of cultivators gathered, waiting for Li Fan to arrive.</p>

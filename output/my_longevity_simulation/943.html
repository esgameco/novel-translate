        <h1>Chapter 943</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The figure that originally appeared a bit blurry suddenly became clear. </p><p></p><p>An old man with a head full of white hair and the character "Law" engraved on his forehead instantly appeared before the Holy Fetus Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what you're talking about?"</p><p></p><p>"Even many Harmonious Dao cultivators are at their wits' end seeing this, yet you, a mere little Nascent Soul, dare to brag?"</p><p></p><p>The old man looked at Li Fan with a gloomy expression, a flash of murderous intent in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan was not intimidated and shrugged, "What if? In any case, you guys don't have any better solutions, right?"</p><p></p><p>This fearless demeanor instead made the old man hesitate a little.</p><p></p><p>After briefly investigating the background of this seemingly extremely arrogant cultivator in front of him, he felt a sense of unusualness.</p><p></p><p>Because this person's background was too clean and concise!</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had appeared out of thin air, with important information deliberately concealed!</p><p></p><p>In this situation, either this person was the avatar of some big shot, or a spy from the Five Elders...</p><p></p><p>"But this kid indeed only has Nascent Soul cultivation, that's for sure. No matter what, he can't turn the tables."</p><p></p><p>"And in any case, the situation can't get any worse..."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, the white-haired old man snorted coldly, "Follow me!"</p><p></p><p>With that, the Holy Fetus Li Fan only felt a blur before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He appeared in the space where Yan Fa Jue originally stayed.</p><p></p><p>Different from what he saw before, that huge sphere composed of countless glyphs that was constantly changing, now seemed to be rusting, rotating and changing extremely slowly.</p><p></p><p>And below the sphere, the little loli Yan Fa Jue was also on the long wooden table, falling into a deep slumber.</p><p></p><p>Three cultivators stood in the distance, looking at Yan Fa Jue with worry on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Noticing the white-haired old man bringing the Holy Fetus Li Fan over, they only glanced at him and didn't ask much.</p><p></p><p>Then they quickly refocused their attention on that glyph light sphere that was about to stop rotating.</p><p></p><p>Some strange power seemed to be entangled on it. When Li Fan's divine sense approached it, he only felt that the surrounding scene seemed to fast-forward hundreds of times.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan decisively retracted his divine sense, he found that in that short instant just now, almost the time of burning one incense stick had passed in reality.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan realized that it was not the surrounding time flow speeding up. Rather, his own thinking speed was extremely slowed down, almost falling into stagnation.</p><p></p><p>"How did it become like this?" The Holy Fetus Li Fan couldn't help frowning slightly and asked the white-haired old man via sound transmission, "Could it be that this place was invaded by thieves, causing this..."</p><p></p><p>This was quite a severe accusation. The white-haired old man's expression changed slightly and he interrupted Li Fan, "Don't talk nonsense."</p><p></p><p>"The cultivators who had contact with Yan Fa Jue during this period have been thoroughly investigated and all ruled out as suspects. In fact, Yan Fa Jue's abnormality appeared mysteriously on the day our Immortal Alliance went to war with the Five Elders."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the image of those five Dharma Appearances pulling the white giant net and distorting the laws of heaven and earth in the Five Elders' territory instantly flashed in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Yan Fa Jue is a wonder of the Mysterious Yellow Realm, also representing a law of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that in this process, she was accidentally injured?"</p><p></p><p>"The Law of Yan Fa itself was not affected, we have repeatedly confirmed that." The white-haired old</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The white-haired elder looked at Li Fan's pensive expression and transmitted his thoughts calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Is it not for this reason..." Li Fan nodded, refocusing his gaze on the character sphere.</p><p></p><p>The eerie force enveloping it was like a barrier formed outside the light sphere, isolating it from all possible external probes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment and once again split off a thread of divine sense, flying towards it.</p><p></p><p>Normally, direct contact with the core of the Derivation Jade was strictly forbidden.</p><p></p><p>However, with the Derivation Jade malfunctioning at the moment, no one came to stop this attempt at "treatment".</p><p></p><p>As the divine sense approached the huge light sphere, the surrounding scene once again became still.</p><p></p><p>Disregarding everything, it continued flying towards the sphere.</p><p></p><p>In the perception of the divine sense, space gradually became distorted and twisted.</p><p></p><p>The character-filled sphere also stretched out, turning into a plane.</p><p></p><p>Like a sheet of white paper from heaven to earth, countless characters on the paper flashed and changed incessantly.</p><p></p><p>From the perspective of the divine sense, the speed at which the Derivation Jade derived the cultivation techniques seemed to have no abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>However, this was because the thinking speed of the divine sense itself was also delayed, resulting in both sides being at the same level.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be caused by that distortion?"</p><p></p><p>The divine sense quickly patrolled around the surface of the paper, simply outlining the current state of the Derivation Jade.</p><p></p><p>"The [Patching Heaven Record] can cure the world's ailments."</p><p></p><p>"The Derivation Jade is the embodiment of the world's laws. As long as the corresponding symptoms are found..."</p><p></p><p>"First, we need to determine whether this strange phenomenon is caused by external factors or the Derivation Jade itself."</p><p></p><p>That thread of divine sense carefully examined it again.</p><p></p><p>For the "illnesses" of the cultivation world, the Patching Heaven Record had its own set of "inspection, auscultation, inquiry, and palpation" techniques.</p><p></p><p>Just as people get sick, if the world falls ill, there will naturally be various abnormal signs appearing.</p><p></p><p>Under the scanning of the divine sense, some clues were indeed discovered.</p><p></p><p>"Insatiable greed, obscuring the heart..."</p><p></p><p>The divine sense understood and double-checked the diagnosis results before dissipating on its own.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan had been standing still for a full seven days and seven nights.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired elder also knew that he was observing the situation inside the Derivation Jade's light sphere, so he had not disturbed him.</p><p></p><p>He was only discussing solutions with the other three cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"We can stall for another month at most."</p><p></p><p>"If it really doesn't work, we should go and invite the [Heavenly Doctor] as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>"Easier said than done. If I could invite him, I would have gone long ago. The Heavenly Doctor's whereabouts are always unpredictable, and it's very difficult to contact him. Moreover, this person acts entirely according to his own preferences and doesn't even give face to the Dharma Transmitters."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The three discussed for a while, their brows still tightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the Holy Fetus Li Fan slowly woke up.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the information transmitted by his divine sense, he secretly nodded in his heart. Then, he imperceptibly shifted his gaze to the seemingly sleeping little loli of the Derivation Jade.</p><p></p><p>"How is it? Any insights?" The white-haired elder didn't have much hope and asked casually.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the Holy Fetus Li Fan nodded, "Almost certain. But it still needs final confirmation."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect you to be... huh?" The white-haired elder suddenly looked at the Holy Fetus, his eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"What did you just say? What's almost certain?"</p><p></p><p>The elder's unusual reaction instantly attracted the attention of the other three Protector Hall cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, they surrounded the Holy Fetus.</p>

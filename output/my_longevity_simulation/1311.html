        <div class="content">
            <p>"When truth becomes falsehood, falsehood becomes truth."</p><p></p><p>"The transformations between truth and falsehood are endlessly profound."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan once again recited in his heart, unable to contain his joy.</p><p></p><p>Although it only lasted for a moment, he had indeed "transformed" his Hua Shen cultivation from his previous life out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>However, it was after all his first attempt at this great divine ability.</p><p></p><p>After a fleeting moment of success, this transformed cultivation disappeared like a dream or bubble, vanishing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not discouraged by this, still overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Creating something out of the void, even legendary true immortals may not be capable of it.</p><p></p><p>But he achieved it preliminarily by relying on the insights brought by multiple Huan Zhen simulations. </p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, all things are difficult before they are easy. With this first success, he would surely become more and more familiar with the use of this divine ability in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Not only my own cultivation. The things I experienced and possessed, and even..."</p><p></p><p>"Different individuals, the Xuan Huang realm, the Abyssal Starry Sea, and everything beyond the high walls. One day, I can recreate them all with a single thought!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood atop the sea of clouds, savoring the feeling when he used the True-False Transformation, his heart surging with excitement.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he finally came back to his senses from the epiphany.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the inheritance options on the Huan Zhen interface, he first chose to inherit the cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The same scene played out again, with the Great Xuan Heavens rumbling incessantly. </p><p></p><p>This was the disturbance caused by Li Fan's Hua Shen cultivation being invisibly infused into the small world.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to the scene of him inheriting cultivation in his previous life, the Great Xuan small world in this life, due to the world transformation triggered by the Zao Hua True Immortal seal script earlier, did not show signs of being overwhelmed.</p><p></p><p>There were only dark clouds gathering and strange phenomena occurring.</p><p></p><p>"Phew..." When the familiar power of cultivation returned to his body, Li Fan let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>Next, his gaze locked onto the second inheritance choice.</p><p></p><p>The inherit cultivation option had already dimmed, leaving only options 1, 3, and 4.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Li Fan chose to inherit items.</p><p></p><p>The items he possessed in his previous life's experiences, including his divine clones and avatars, all instantly appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Waiting for him to quietly select.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept over slightly, pondering for a moment, and finally landed on an ordinary-looking white ring.</p><p></p><p>This white ring, before being fished up, the Holy Emperor had not completely severed from Li Fan's true body, so it was also considered an item he once possessed.</p><p></p><p>After confirming the selection, light flashed in his hand, finally condensing into a plain white ring.</p><p></p><p>It felt slightly cool to the touch. Sweeping over it with divine sense, no spiritual power fluctuations could be detected.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that because it was transformed from Huan Zhen, there was no need for refining to acknowledge its master. The moment Li Fan held the white ring, he already had the feeling of being able to freely use it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the name displayed for this white ring on the Huan Zhen interface.</p><p></p><p>"Luo Fan Chen." (Falling into the Mortal Dust)</p><p></p><p>Hand caressing the white ring, Li Fan muttered these three words, while pondering the correct way to use the white ring in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan tossed the white ring towards Mount Jie Li below.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the white ring grew in the wind, instantly enveloping the entire mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>Then it fell downwards.</p><p></p><p>As the white ring landed, the mountain that it encircled along the way disintegrated and disappeared inch by inch before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Transforming into spiritual energy, dissipating into the Great Xuan world.</p><p></p><p>The several thousand zhang tall Mount Jie Li disappeared just like that. The countless creatures residing on the mountain, due to the sudden disappearance of the mountain, fell uncontrollably from the sky. If it weren't for the spiritual energy rising from the white ring's disintegration of Mount Jie Li holding them in place, perhaps in an instant Mount Jie Li would have already become a hell.</p><p></p><p>Now this area could perhaps be called the Jie Li Ring.</p><p></p><p>The earth looked as if it had been sliced by a knife, smooth as a mirror.</p><p></p><p>The creatures of Mount Jie Li who lost their habitat frantically fled and left due to instinctive fear.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the originally lively Mount Jie Li had already become a forbidden zone for life.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took a deep breath, absorbing all the disintegrated spiritual energy into his body.</p><p></p><p>This bit of spiritual energy, for him now, was not even a drop in the bucket. It was mainly to analyze the spiritual energy of the Luo Fan Chen white ring to see what differences it had compared to ordinary spiritual energy between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>After carefully savoring it for a while, Li Fan came to a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>There was no difference at all.</p><p></p><p>This spiritual energy even gave Li Fan an extremely familiar feeling, as if it was originally meant to be born in the Great Xuan small world.</p><p></p><p>"Clearly it's the energy from matter disintegration, but on the Huan Zhen interface, it has a name like Luo Fan Chen (Falling into the Mortal Dust)."</p><p></p><p>"Luo Fan Chen..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, this should be a punitive treasure specifically for immortal weapons." Li Fan suddenly had an epiphany in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"In my previous life, the Holy Emperor's avatar didn't have a chance to test it more. In this life, perhaps I can use the few near-immortal weapons of the Xuan Huang realm to verify my guess."</p><p></p><p>Putting away the white ring, Li Fan looked downwards.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary mortals, this was definitely an unimaginably terrifying event.</p><p></p><p>Believing it to be a punishment sent down from the heavens, the mortals below Mount Jie Li had already spontaneously begun to organize sacrifices in trepidation.</p><p></p><p>Not daring to approach that huge ring on the ground, people only dared to pray outside the ring.</p><p></p><p>Unsurprisingly, Li Fan saw Sun Er Lang and Wang Xuan Ba, his former disciples, among this group of people.</p><p></p><p>With a flick of his finger, a figure floated down from the sky, descending to the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Its appearance was 70% similar to Li Fan's. However, with a long beard and white hair, its attire was somewhat similar to the Dharma Heavenly Venerate's.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, look, an immortal!"</p><p></p><p>The commoners all knelt on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The figure waved his hand, and the kneeling mortals stood up again.</p><p></p><p>The figure sat cross-legged in the air and began to preach to the surrounding mortals.</p><p></p><p>The wisps of spiritual energy born from the world transformation in the Great Xuan small world were all attracted here by the preaching figure.</p><p></p><p>Forming a visible vortex above the Jie Li Ring.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan used this spiritual energy to casually set up an array. Before long, a miniature dharma array for expelling miasma from the bodies of mortals was formed.</p><p></p><p>Under the dual effects of the figure's preaching and the array.</p><p></p><p>In just the time to drink a cup of tea, among the mortals listening to the teachings below, there were already those who completed the expulsion of miasma.</p><p></p><p>Sun Er Lang and Wang Xuan Ba were naturally among them.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Jie Li Ring, the earth rumbled, and the positions of these creatures who completed the first step of cultivation flowed like water.</p><p></p><p>After gathering them in one place, it slowly rose and bulged.</p><p></p><p>Thus, these people were a bit closer to the immortal master preaching above.</p><p></p><p>The figure preached for a full seven days.</p><p></p><p>Within the seven days, the positions of those who successfully guided qi into their bodies and reached the Qi Refining stage continued to rise.</p><p></p><p>Forming distinct stair-like platforms.</p><p></p><p>After seven days, the figure transformed into a soaring light and flew away. At the same time, a thought flashed in the minds of all the cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>The immortal master's preaching would continue in a month.</p><p></p><p>Even the stupidest person,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He also realized that this was a tremendous opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the news of the Immortal Master's preaching spread like wildfire, spreading to various parts of the Great Profound Realm at a terrifying speed.</p><p></p><p>Within the Separation Circle, people also discovered the many mysteries of this Preaching Platform.</p><p></p><p>The Preaching Platform was a respectful term used by the mortals who listened to the Immortal Master's teachings to refer to the Separation Circle. Inside, it was divided into different levels based on individual cultivation, with higher cultivation levels seated in higher positions.</p><p></p><p>Each person's position was fixed and could not be exchanged or seized.</p><p></p><p>Sitting on the Preaching Platform, even when the Immortal Master's figure was no longer present, one could still close their eyes and gain various profound insights.</p><p></p><p>Now, at the highest level of the Preaching Platform, one could vaguely see a glowing platform floating above.</p><p></p><p>On the platform, the names of various cultivation techniques seemed to be engraved.</p><p></p><p>Sitting on the Preaching Platform, with a single thought, one could understand the specific information about these techniques.</p><p></p><p>Each cultivator could choose one to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>When someone completed their selection, the name of the technique on the glowing platform would disappear, transforming into a beam of light that entered the chosen cultivator's sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang and Wang Xuanba, looking at the thousands of technique names, were almost dazzled.</p><p></p><p>"Erlang, which one do you think I should choose?" Wang Xuanba asked, scratching his head.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to rush. With so many techniques, take your time to choose. It will take at least several days for people from other places to hear the news and rush over. However, once you make a choice, if you want to change it, you'll have to wait until the next realm, so you must be cautious," Sun Erlang analyzed calmly, without blinking an eye.</p><p></p><p>Above the Preaching Platform.</p><p></p><p>The preaching figure had never actually left, only concealing its form, undetected by the people below.</p><p></p><p>The techniques here were all obtained from the little loli Yan Faju in the previous life.</p><p></p><p>Yan Faju used simulated personalities to slack off.</p><p></p><p>The techniques derived by the simulated personalities were thus recorded by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>At this 3-year anchor point, these techniques had not yet been derived by Yan Faju, so there was no need to worry about alerting the Protector Hall of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The stockpile accumulated by Yan Faju in the previous life was enough for Li Fan to use for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"In this life, I shall become the teacher of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"Preaching the profound and yellow, starting from the Great Profound."</p><p></p><p>The preaching phantom sitting in midair thought to himself as he watched the countless beings rushing over from various parts of the Great Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>The phantom silently preached, igniting the sparks of the teacher of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Fan's true body, he had arrived deep underground in the Great Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>Since he planned to merge with the Super Profound Yellow Realm's Essence of Heaven and Earth in this life, he naturally had to stimulate the Profound Yellow Realm's potential to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>In addition to factors such as immortal spiritual power, hidden forces of the remnant realms, and Talisman of Creation.</p><p></p><p>Promoting the return of subsidiary small worlds to the Profound Yellow Realm and realizing the unification of myriad realms could also serve as a major boost.</p><p></p><p>After all, even a mosquito is still meat.</p><p></p><p>Especially after Li Fan used the Talisman of True Immortal Creation to first achieve the sublimation and transformation of the various small worlds. The return of myriad realms would definitely be a significant nourishing force for the Profound Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, the stronger the Profound Yellow Realm became in the future, the stronger the Essence of Heaven and Earth it would nurture.</p><p></p><p>It would also be more advantageous for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"The subsidiary worlds, driven by the Rift Whales, have drifted far away from the Profound Yellow Realm after thousands of years of evolution. They are only connected to the Profound Yellow Realm through narrow void passages."</p><p></p><p>"To promote their reintegration with the Profound Yellow Realm, the first thing to do is to reactivate the severed connections."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes, and the scene of the Great Profound small world and the Profound Yellow light sphere appeared in his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The Great Profound was like a flickering light bean floating outside, shimmering and distant.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the grand formation arose.</p><p></p><p>Vast spiritual power surged out from Li Fan's body, rushing through the underground, spreading to various parts of the Great Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>From Li Fan's perspective, lines of formation runes were also generated accordingly.</p><p></p><p>Using the formation as a knife, he continuously reshaped the Great Profound small world.</p><p></p><p>Without anyone noticing, the small world slowly moved towards the Profound Yellow Realm in the void.</p><p></p><p>Undoing the efforts of countless Rift Whales over thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Just before colliding with the Profound Yellow Realm, the Great Profound small world finally came to a halt.</p><p></p><p>From within the world, formation tentacles slowly emerged, silently attaching to the Profound Yellow main realm.</p><p></p><p>As if receiving nourishment from the placenta to the mother's body, the transformation process of the Great Profound small world suddenly accelerated.</p><p></p><p>When selecting the attachment location, Li Fan deliberately manipulated and changed the connection point between the Great Profound small world and the Profound Yellow main realm.</p><p></p><p>Instead of choosing the Congyu Sea, he changed it to Shilin Province.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the vast Profound Yellow main realm, the size of the Great Profound small world was almost negligible.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the attachment of the Great Profound had not yet attracted the attention of the Profound Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's plan could thus proceed smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Imperceptible threads of formation runes, along the Great Profound tentacles, slowly entered the Profound Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>While making the connection between the Great Profound small world and the Profound Yellow Realm increasingly close, it also silently transferred a part of a vast formation into the Profound Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was just an incomplete formation structure, difficult for even Li Fan himself to detect before it was officially activated.</p><p></p><p>"The day of the return of myriad realms will be the time when the formation takes shape."</p><p></p><p>Of course, what Li Fan laid out this time was not the All Things Return to Void Grand Formation, but a grand formation used to capture the Immortal Essence of Heaven and Earth that would be born in the future.</p><p></p><p>It was about preventing problems before they arose.</p><p></p><p>After the birth of the Super Profound Yellow Realm, the first Immortal Essence of Heaven and Earth it would nurture was Li Fan's target for future merging.</p><p></p><p>Through a series of guidance, constantly deepening the difficulty of the heavenly duties it needed to perform.</p><p></p><p>The more the Profound Yellow Realm borrowed strength, the stronger the Immortal Essence of Heaven and Earth would become.</p><p></p><p>To ensure foolproof success and quickly achieve the merging.</p><p></p><p>This formation prepared in advance was crucial.</p><p></p><p>"The strongest Essence of Heaven and Earth belongs to the phantoms of the past Great Celestial Venerables. The Essence of Heaven and Earth is fully bestowed upon them. Just one of their Daos is equivalent to more than half of the total Essence of Heaven and Earth in the Profound Yellow Realm."</p><p></p><p>"In the 115th world, the Dao White was able to slightly block the Transmission Dao. In this world, after my various means of comprehensive enhancement, it should be able to reach the limit of the Star Sea."</p><p></p><p>"If there are further breakthroughs in the research of immortal spiritual power, it may not be impossible to attain the realm of half-immortality..."</p><p></p><p>"The only thing to consider is that the phantoms of the Great Celestial Venerables may have traces of the immortal realm from back then. While devouring them, I still need to be cautious and on guard." Thinking of the strange influence Dao White had on his mind and spirit back then, Li Fan secretly pondered.</p><p></p><p>As the bridgehead for preaching the Profound Yellow and the template for the invasion formations of other small worlds in the future, Li Fan constructed the invasion formation for the Great Profound with particular care.</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, the Celestial Physician and the Transmission Dao had once joined hands and performed the Soul Sealing Substitution Realm Technique.</p><p></p><p>It showed that their control over the Profound Yellow Realm had reached a meticulous level.</p><p></p><p>If the tentacles of the small world invasion formation were noticed by them and the two returned from the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's plan would be disrupted.</p>

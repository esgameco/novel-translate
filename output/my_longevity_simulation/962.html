            <p>"The first cultivator to be infected by the Immortal-Mortal Miasma, is also the one who created it. New 69 Book Bar → 69shux.com"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's voice echoed faintly.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren did not refute, only tightly grasping his own hair, as if feeling great pain from this fact. </p><p></p><p>"How is it possible, how can it be..." He kept muttering under his breath, looking lost and sorrowful.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Li Fan continued slowly: "The Immortal-Mortal Miasma, formed by going against the principles of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"The one who could create the Immortal-Mortal Miasma..."</p><p></p><p>"Is none other than the Eternal Life Venerable! In other words, what lies before us are the remains of one who has attained a new method of immortality."</p><p></p><p>"The instant the Immortal-Mortal Miasma was born within him, according to the rules set by the Venerable's new method, he thereby attained the realm of eternal life. But at the same time..."</p><p></p><p>"The power of the rule known as the Immortal-Mortal Miasma, began rampaging and destroying within his body."</p><p></p><p>"Though mortal, one can still slay the immortals. The might of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma is known to all in the Primordial Yellow Realm. But I believe, if that Eternal Life Venerable wanted to preserve his own life, he was completely capable of doing so. Yet he deliberately chose not to."</p><p></p><p>"Because once he did that, it would mean he destroyed again the rules he himself established. Although it wouldn't lead to the failure of going against the principles..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan paused, as if pondering and deducing. </p><p></p><p>After a moment, he then resolutely said: "It's very likely it would leave behind a loophole: The Eternal Life Venerable can ignore the power of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma."</p><p></p><p>"In order to prevent such a thing from happening, he allowed the Immortal-Mortal Miasma to devour himself. Equivalent to burying himself with his own hands..."</p><p></p><p>"What was obtained, was merely one result: The cultivators of the Primordial Yellow Realm, regardless of cultivation. From Qi Refinement below, to Eternal Life above, none can escape the effects of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression was solemn: "But..."</p><p></p><p>"What meaning does this ultimately have?"</p><p></p><p>"In but a few thousand years, the Immortal-Mortal Miasma already exists in name only. As long as one is careful in dealing with it, cultivators can still freely massacre mortals as they please."</p><p></p><p>"And this Eternal Life Venerable, for what purpose did he go so far as to stake his own life, in order to create the Immortal-Mortal Miasma?"</p><p></p><p>Deep doubts surfaced on Li Fan's face.</p><p></p><p>This was not pretense, but heartfelt.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren was silent and did not answer.</p><p></p><p>He lightly waved his hand, and the transparent barrier in front of him disappeared. Carefully picking up that white rib from the ground, as if handling a rare treasure, gently caressing it.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, the first time I saw this rib, it was as if the appearance of its owner when alive appeared before my eyes."</p><p></p><p>"What a perfect countenance that was! All the magnificent words in the world combined could not describe a ten-thousandth of it."</p><p></p><p>"However, it was such a perfect person, who perished due to being infected by the Immortal-Mortal Miasma. At that time, I secretly vowed in my heart that I must find the culprit who created the Immortal-Mortal Miasma and caused this perfect person's demise, and then..."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren let out a bitter laugh: "I never imagined that after searching for so many years, New 69 Book Bar 89shux.com the so-called murderer was always right in front of me."</p><p></p><p>"And I never knew, never knew!"</p><p></p><p>His mind greatly shaken, Yin Shangren suddenly coughed up a large amount of fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the image of when he first met Yin Shangren suddenly flashed in Li Fan's mind. </p><p></p><p>No different from now, clothes disheveled.</p><p></p><p>Constantly muttering to himself "I must find you, I must find you..."</p><p></p><p>And now, he had finally found the so-called murderer.</p><p></p><p>But this outcome was not one he could easily accept.</p><p></p><p>Painstakingly searching for most of his life, the so-called murderer was the victim himself.</p><p></p><p>What an irony this was.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder every time, not long after finding out the truth, he would self-immolate." Li Fan silently thought.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly recalled, in a previous life Su Changyu had by chance come to this Yin Yin Island and was imparted the [Foundation Establishment Method Using Myself].</p><p></p><p>And the reason Yin Shangren did this, was because of Su Changyu's attempt to save the mortals on the island.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Yin Shangren had asked "Why? Why would you, a cultivator, go save these mortals?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at it now, he was likely not just simply questioning Su Changyu.</p><p></p><p>More so, it was incomprehension towards the actions of this Eternal Life Venerable who created the Immortal-Mortal Miasma.</p><p></p><p>Not just Yin Shangren, Li Fan also completely could not understand such behavior.</p><p></p><p>Taking it a step further, if there really was someone in the world so noble as to willingly sacrifice their own life to protect mortals...</p><p></p><p>At the very least it should also be effective, the sacrifice should be meaningful, right? </p><p></p><p>From the current state of the Primordial Yellow Realm, the situation of mortals has only improved slightly. They still can be freely massacred by cultivators, unable to defend themselves.</p><p></p><p>Just like Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi back then.</p><p></p><p>Foundation Establishment cultivators could easily annihilate a mortal city.</p><p></p><p>Compared to before the birth of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma, everything seems to have no difference at all.</p><p></p><p>If what he wanted was merely this...</p><p></p><p>Then it's not noble, but foolish.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator capable of going against the principles of heaven and earth, Li Fan believed absolutely could not be such a person.</p><p></p><p>Then what was his true purpose?</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Li Fan still voiced the doubts in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren gave a miserable smile: "Fellow Daoist still hasn't figured it out? He wasn't just for the mortals of the world, even more so it was for the cultivators of the world."</p><p></p><p>"Cultivators of the world?" Li Fan's body shook, as if realizing something.</p><p></p><p>"After the Imparting Dharma Venerable went against the principles of heaven and earth and established a new method, cultivators of the world all need to cultivate according to the new method. New 69 Book Bar → 69shux.com Theoretically speaking, from now on no matter how exceptionally talented or heaven-defying a cultivator's aptitude is, they absolutely cannot jump out of the framework set by the Imparting Dharma."</p><p></p><p>"Destined to be forever suppressed by the Imparting Dharma. In a sense, to the cultivators of the Primordial Yellow Realm, the Imparting Dharma is an invincible existence." Yin Shangren said intermittently, seeming a bit mentally unstable.</p><p></p><p>And a scene suddenly flashed before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>A figure in white robes, sighing towards the sky: "The immortal path ahead cannot be tread, the Imparting Dharma Venerable is above!"</p><p></p><p>"But he, at the cost of his own life, created a possibility for the cultivators of the Primordial Yellow Realm. A possibility that can threaten the Imparting Dharma." Yin Shangren blanked for a moment, before continuing.</p><p></p><p>"As fellow Eternal Life Venerables, although his actual combat power may be much higher than the Imparting Dharma's, their statuses are actually the same. Since the Immortal-Mortal Miasma can fatally injure him, by the same logic..."</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal-Mortal Miasma can also heavily injure or even kill the Imparting Dharma Venerable!" Yin Shangren's voice suddenly rose a bit, sounding somewhat agitated.</p><p></p><p>"After the Great Calamity, the Imparting Dharma Venerable has almost vanished from the world..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Even after re-establishing the Myriad Immortals Alliance later on, he rarely showed his face. Who knows if there weren't factors in this regard? Because he was also afraid! Haha!" </p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's demeanor gradually became somewhat manic.</p><p></p><p>"He not only found a way for the cultivators of the world to kill the Dharma Transmitter, but also pointed out a path that could thoroughly defeat the Dharma Transmitter! After all, relying solely on the Immortal-Mortal Miasma to try to kill the Dharma Transmitting Heavenly Venerate..."</p><p></p><p>"Although there is this possibility, the probability of success is far too low."</p><p></p><p>"But the method he pointed out to defeat the Dharma Transmitting order is indeed absolutely feasible!" Yin Shangren violently spat out a mouthful of fresh blood again due to his shaking emotions.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Immortal-Mortal Miasma can become a flaw of the Dharma Transmitter, why can't more flaws be created? As long as there are powerful figures who can attain the Longevity Realm and are willing to sacrifice themselves..."</p><p></p><p>"The flaws of the Dharma Transmitter will inevitably become more and more. One day, it will be riddled with holes and will collapse with a single poke!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's eyes were wide open.</p><p></p><p>"As long as there are people like him, willing to sacrifice themselves..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Expecting everyone in the world to have such awareness...</p><p></p><p>It was really asking a bit too much.</p><p></p><p>One is the carefree life of longevity, the other is using one's own life to gamble on the illusory possibility of the future...</p><p></p><p>As long as one is a normal person, they would know how to choose.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren smiled bitterly, "In the thousands of years of Xuanhuang, there hasn't been a second cultivator who has done the same."</p><p></p><p>"They all deserve to die! They all deserve to die..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan comforted, "Daoist Yin, don't be too extreme."</p><p></p><p>However, Yin Shangren completely ignored Li Fan, and even his gaze slowly became somewhat hostile as he looked at Li Fan, "What do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>He took out the white rib from his bosom and said with disdain, "I know, the cultivators of the world all cherish their lives. How many people took the path of cultivation precisely because they were afraid of death?"</p><p></p><p>"But how can your lives be mentioned in the same breath as his?"</p><p></p><p>"He... he..."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's eyes suddenly flowed with fine traces of blood, "He was originally a Longevity Heavenly Venerate!"</p><p></p><p>These words were like a thunderbolt, striking Li Fan's soul.</p><p></p><p>Even with his composure, he couldn't help but exclaim, "What?"</p><p></p><p>"He was originally a Longevity Heavenly Venerate? What does that mean?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan hurriedly asked.</p><p></p><p>"What does it mean? It means exactly what it says. Before the ancient methods disappeared, the last ancient method's 【Longevity Heavenly Venerate】 who attained the power of heaven and earth's longevity and proved longevity!" Yin Shangren said word by word.</p><p></p><p>"Only the bones of an ancient Heavenly Venerate can be like this, as if receiving the fortune of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren said while caressing the rib with obsession.</p><p></p><p>Then his eyes suddenly became full of gloom, staring at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of deadlock, Yin Shangren suddenly raised his head to look at the sky, his eyes becoming full of doubt and confusion.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he muttered to himself, "Moreover, he is not the same as those thieves. His longevity was actively bestowed by this world."</p><p></p><p>"He clearly could have left this place..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not disturb him, only silently recording everything Yin Shangren said.</p><p></p><p>"Ancient method longevity? And it's a longevity realm different from the others."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder his performance was so invincible whether in the Beast Taming Sect or the Heavenly Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>"But what exactly did he transform into to reach the Longevity Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps, back then, his ascension in one step was not only from a mortal to the Deity Transformation Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but feel a bit absurd.</p><p></p><p>Such progress was simply unprecedented and unsurpassed!</p><p></p><p>"Even if he was favored by the Heavenly Dao, it shouldn't treat him like this."</p><p></p><p>"Calling him a son of heaven is an understatement, it's simply treating him like a biological father."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that in his previous life, he saved the Xuanhuang Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking like this, a thought suddenly appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>He was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"No... it can't be, right?"</p><p></p><p>Quickly sorting through his thoughts, the guess in his heart became clearer.</p><p></p><p>Similarly a perfect person.</p><p></p><p>Similarly concerned about the living beings of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Heavenly King disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Many years later, another mortal was born in the world.</p><p></p><p>Favored by the Heavenly Dao, even to an outrageous extent.</p><p></p><p>Connecting all these together, an answer seemed to be vaguely forming.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but think, "Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>"Is Mr. White the reincarnation of the Mysterious Heavenly King?"</p><p></p><p>That's right, the appearance of the restored skull Li Fan saw was exactly the same as Mr. White's.</p><p></p><p>And the reason why it was rumored that the first cultivator infected with the Immortal-Mortal Miasma had the surname Su...</p><p></p><p>That was because...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but recall the scene he saw in the Fallen Immortal Realm back then.</p><p></p><p>"The dog was just an abandoned defective product. If it weren't for Xiao Bai..."</p><p></p><p>Huang Fa Lu Ya was explaining to Li Fan, but was kicked hard from behind.</p><p></p><p>Lu Ya hurriedly corrected himself, "If it weren't for 【Mr. White】 taking action to treat him, I'm afraid the dog would have lost his life long ago."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>That's right, the reason why Mr. White was called Mr. White was because after hearing the name 【Xiao Bai】, the orphans of Ningyuan City gave him this respectful title.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, they were not very clear about the true name of the best person in the world.</p><p></p><p>And with Mr. White's personality, even if he knew this was a misunderstanding by the children, he most likely wouldn't stop or correct them.</p><p></p><p>As long as the children were happy.</p><p></p><p>After all, the name Mr. White sounded quite nice.</p><p></p><p>"Su Bai..."</p><p></p><p>"This is his name."</p><p></p><p>"Attaining longevity with the old methods, going against the principles of heaven and earth, and then attaining longevity with the new methods."</p><p></p><p>"I originally thought that there was no one in the world who could do this, but I never thought..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled the conversation he heard before between Sun Qi and Sun Liancheng.</p><p></p><p>"The more one is favored by heaven and earth, the more difficult it is to go against the principles of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"The backlash suffered will be even deeper."</p><p></p><p>"In this situation, he was still able to go against the principles of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan became even more silent.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts surged, not knowing how long had passed.</p><p></p><p>The abnormality in front of him pulled Li Fan back to reality.</p><p></p><p>There was a strange energy fluctuation on Yin Shangren's body.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could also see that Yin Shangren's state at this time was very abnormal.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that he could go berserk at any time.</p><p></p><p>But in this state, he seemed to be able to glimpse many mysteries between heaven and earth, fully exploring the past and present lives of the rib's owner.</p><p></p><p>"Why? Why?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren painfully grabbed his head, and the vertical line in the center of his body slowly appeared.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if it would split open at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quietly distanced himself a little.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren was rolling on the ground in pain, and Li Fan vaguely heard continuous explosion sounds coming from the underground chamber on Yin Island where Yin Shangren's countless corpses were placed.</p><p></p><p>Tremors and faint ringing sounds continued.</p>

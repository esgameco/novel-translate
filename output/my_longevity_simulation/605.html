            <p>When he figured out that he had been reincarnated into the ancient immortal world before the rise of the ten immortal sects of the immortal path imposing dominance over the world and before the birth of the new laws, a daring idea emerged in Qiao Sidao's mind.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to follow the Supreme Heaven-Transmitting Honored One and become one of the initial law transmitters!</p><p></p><p>Don't look at how powerful the ten immortal sects of the immortal path are now.</p><p></p><p>Qiao Sidao, who is well aware of the future trends, is very clear that this seemingly eternal rule is no match for the surging new law trend!</p><p></p><p>Before long, the army of speedy new law practitioners who can sweep the heavens and earth, with the leadership of the Supreme Heaven-Transmitting Honored One, will destroy the immortal path sects and establish the great Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals that will dominate for tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>And achieving the greatest merit by following the Supreme.</p><p></p><p>If he could pledge allegiance before the Supreme Heaven-Transmitting Honored One rose to prominence, it would assure him a seat in the highest ruling body of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals, the Law-Transmitting Council!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>This is how Qiao Sidao originally thought.</p><p></p><p>And this is what he did.</p><p></p><p>Abandoning the inner disciple status within the Seven Star Sect that he had fought so hard to obtain, trekking through mountains and rivers from the hinterlands of the immortal land to the remote wasteland of Cloud Mist.</p><p></p><p>After patiently waiting for over ten years, he finally welcomed the great Heaven-Transmitting Honored One...</p><p></p><p>No, at this point, it should be called the Supreme Heaven-Transmitting Immortal.</p><p></p><p>News of the Immortal's transmission of teachings had spread in the surrounding areas not long ago.</p><p></p><p>But at this point, the Immortal's reputation was not prominent.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly saying he wanted to transmit teachings, could anyone in the world believe it?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in front of him, there were only more than ten practitioners who had come upon hearing the news, hoping to join in the excitement.</p><p></p><p>Qiao Sidao hurriedly took a seat in the central front row, wanting to make himself familiar.</p><p></p><p>Observing the surroundings, he thought that these people would be the few major transmitters who would wield power in the future Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals, and his heart beat a bit faster.</p><p></p><p>When the Supreme Heaven-Transmitting Immortal's gaze fell upon him, Qiao Sidao's heart skipped a beat, and he immediately restrained himself.</p><p></p><p>He dared not look around anymore.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, on a small island in Cloud Mist, only thirty-some practitioners had gathered.</p><p></p><p>But the Immortal didn't mind.</p><p></p><p>Sitting on the ground, he began to talk about the Dao in a lofty manner.</p><p></p><p>From the mysteries of the world, the principles of immortals, to the secrets of the human body and energy cultivation, and the various connections between the world and all living beings.</p><p></p><p>The fascinating discourse left all the practitioners present enthralled.</p><p></p><p>As the Supreme Heaven-Transmitting Immortal continued, various anomalies began to appear in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Rolling purple energy came from afar, under the reflection of the golden light in the sky, it appeared divinely extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Even at night, the purple-golden energy on the island continued unabated, visible from hundreds of miles away.</p><p></p><p>Consequently, more and more practitioners were drawn by the sight of the Immortal's teachings.</p><p></p><p>Spreading the word, they continuously flocked to the island.</p><p></p><p>Before the Supreme Heaven-Transmitting Immortal, they dared not act rashly. As the front rows were already occupied by layers of practitioners, they had to find a seat in the back one by one.</p><p></p><p>And as they immersed themselves in the Immortal's teachings, they regretted more and more.</p><p></p><p>Regretting why they hadn't come earlier and missed out on the extraordinary teachings before.</p><p></p><p>The number of practitioners gathered on the island grew increasingly.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, there were over ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>It was only at this point that the Supreme Heaven-Transmitting Immortal began to speak.</p><p></p><p>"Ascend to immortality, why beg the heavens? If the heavens do not grant it, then take it for yourself!"</p><p></p><p>"With the heavens is mundane, against the heavens is immortal!"</p><p></p><p>Thus, the path of immortality is:</p><p></p><p>Absorbing the essence of heaven and earth to control its energies;</p><p></p><p>Using the oddities of heaven and earth to build the foundation of the path;</p><p></p><p>Prying into the laws of heaven and earth to refine the elixir;</p><p></p><p>Seizing the essence of heaven and earth to form the primordial infant;</p><p></p><p>Extracting the marrow of heaven and earth to obtain its divinity;</p><p></p><p>Offering sacrifices to heaven and earth to unify with the Dao;</p><p></p><p>Denying the principles of heaven and earth to prove eternal life!</p><p></p><p>After the opening statement, the Supreme Heaven-Transmitting Immortal proceeded to explain the details of each realm in depth.</p><p></p><p>Leaving all the practitioners on the island speechless with awe.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that immortality could be cultivated in such a manner!</p><p></p><p>And Qiao Sidao, in particular, was listening with boiling blood.</p><p></p><p>Because the practitioners present were the ones who, with this plundering and dominating new law, ultimately overturned the ten immortal sects of the immortal path in the future and established the great Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Feeling as though he were personally in the midst of historical currents, Qiao Sidao felt he had already become a part of history.</p><p></p><p>However, what he never expected was that during the crucial moment of the Supreme Heaven-Transmitting Immortal's teachings, when he spoke of "denying the principles of heaven and earth," a cold snort suddenly resounded through the heavens and earth, interrupting the Immortal's speech.</p><p></p><p>"You deceive the people with false words!"</p><p></p><p>"The heavens and earth nurture all beings, and if practitioners do not think about reciprocating, it's fine, but to engage in such wicked plunder is despicable."</p><p></p><p>"How different is this from beasts?"</p><p></p><p>The thunderous voice echoed continuously.</p><p></p><p>Being abruptly interrupted, the practitioners listening on the island were naturally shocked and angered.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to be so ignorant of life and death?"</p><p></p><p>Qiao Sidao, on the other hand, maintained a watchful stance, with a seemingly enjoying-the-show attitude.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the Supreme Heaven-Transmitting Immortal wielded unparalleled power in the world for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this provocative speaker seeking death?</p><p></p><p>However, a scene caught his eye inadvertently that made him feel somewhat uneasy.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the Supreme Heaven-Transmitting Immortal suddenly stood up.</p><p></p><p>His face filled with solemnity.</p><p></p><p>"Don't you know your friend's name?"</p><p></p><p>"The so-called great Dao is three thousand..." The Immortal raised his hand as if to speak.</p><p></p><p>But he was once again rudely interrupted by the other party.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>With a violent shout, the speaker also revealed his figure.</p><p></p><p>He appeared to be a teenager of no more than ten years, clad in bright golden armor, a red ribbon adorning his head, and holding a silver spear.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, the one taking your lives today is from the Zao-Hua Sect, Wu!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the silver long spear descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"You insolent brat..."</p><p></p><p>The Immortal coldly snorted and gently stretched out his right hand as if to take him down.</p><p></p><p>Who knew...</p><p></p><p>In a flash, the silver light pierced through the Immortal's body.</p><p></p><p>Following that unyielding momentum, it violently smashed onto the earth.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>In the Immortal's unbelieving eyes, the entire island of Ten Thousand Immortals turned into dust in an instant.</p><p></p><p>As the massive silver shockwave shattered the island, it continued to sweep towards Cloud Mist.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, the vast Cloud Mist no longer had a single living creature in sight.</p><p></p><p>Only the rampaging silver serpent danced in the void.</p><p></p><p>"Ignorant fool!"</p><p></p><p>Just before Qiao Sidao's consciousness faded, he only heard Wu's cold snort.</p><p></p><p>And witnessed the slow disappearance of the Supreme Heaven-Transmitting Immortal's figure.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When he woke up from a pitch-black void, Qiao Sidao was pleasantly surprised to find that he had returned to the initial time of his reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>Outer disciples of the Seven Star Sect were wracking their brains for the inner sect assessment.</p><p></p><p>His mind was filled with countless doubts.</p><p></p><p>Why?</p><p></p><p>How could the Supreme Heaven-Transmitting Immortal have fallen so easily?</p><p></p><p>Who was that "Wu"?</p><p></p><p>Why had he never heard of him before?</p><p></p><p>Countless doubts surged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Days passed, but Qiao Sidao still found it difficult to come up with a reasonable explanation.</p><p></p><p>However, since the world he was reborn into was different from the historical trajectory he remembered, he had to carefully consider the future.</p><p></p><p>With a ruthless figure like "Wu," it seemed unlikely that the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals could thrive.</p><p></p><p>Though with some regret, he realized the importance of seizing the moment.</p><p></p><p>In this life, Qiao Sidao decisively chose to ally with the Ten Immortal Sects of the immortal path.</p><p></p><p>And then, something unexpected happened.</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, there was "Wu" who ended the Supremes' life with a single spear.</p><p></p><p>Yet in this life, he simply did not exist.</p><p></p><p>Without his grand act on the Ten Thousand Immortals Island, the new law spread throughout the entire realm within a few years.</p><p></p><p>Mighty and unstoppable.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1271</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1268: The Ineffective Immortal Power</p><p></p><p>The situation was exactly the same as when he first encountered the Starving Character Technique.</p><p></p><p>The moment the True Immortal Seal character at the center of the protective formation appeared in Li Fan's sea of consciousness, he understood its meaning.</p><p></p><p>Return!</p><p></p><p>Unlike the curses of "ridicule" and "chaos", it was more like a decree!</p><p></p><p>"A complete True Immortal Seal character..."</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan's mind was shaken, he had already quietly memorized the form of this "Return" character.</p><p></p><p>"Return? Return to where? Or return to its original state?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, carefully savoring this mysterious power.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the Infinite Mirror Spirit had also completed the exploration of the areas outside the core of the protective formation.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, that place..." Sun Luyao stared blankly at that void.</p><p></p><p>An invisible connection was instantly formed, as if linking the "Return" character with the Infinite Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The scene unfolding before his eyes really left Li Fan a bit baffled. However, from the inherent meaning of the Return character itself, as well as the changes in the Infinite Mirror, he could make some guesses.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could clearly feel the fear and confusion that suddenly arose in Sun Luyao's heart.</p><p></p><p>Those "wisps of smoke" that were summoned by the "Return" character technique and went to unknown places actually returned!</p><p></p><p>It was as if a time reversal technique had occurred on the Infinite Mirror. The Infinite Mirror, which had shrunk to the size of a thumb, suddenly became full again before Li Fan's eyes!</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao, who was wailing and thought his end was near, grew weaker and weaker. In the end, he stared at the restored Infinite Mirror in disbelief, not understanding what had happened.</p><p></p><p>An unexpected situation occurred.</p><p></p><p>And those ignited parts, that is, the components affected by the "Return" character technique, floated away like wisps of smoke to unknown places.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that due to having already received a decree once, the reappeared Infinite Mirror was actually able to ignore the existence of the Return character technique.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan naturally noticed the changes in the Infinite Mirror the moment they occurred.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart sank, wanting to try to stop the dissolution of the Infinite Mirror. But even his true self could not contend with the power of the True Immortal Seal characters, let alone this avatar of his.</p><p></p><p>The two were unaffected by each other.</p><p></p><p>Just when Li Fan thought that this immortal artifact, which had been of great help to him, was about to completely vanish.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, even the Infinite Mirror itself began to gradually "disintegrate".</p><p></p><p>With a hint of regret, he watched as the Infinite Mirror shrank smaller and smaller amidst Sun Luyao's constant wailing.</p><p></p><p>After being stunned for a moment, Li Fan came to his senses and looked at the "Return" character technique again.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Nowhere to return to?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior, save me!" Sun Luyao instinctively cried out.</p><p></p><p>And the Return character technique also chose to ignore the Infinite Mirror, continuing to quietly lie in the void core of the great formation.</p><p></p><p>Even the Infinite Mirror itself began to tremble without warning. Amidst the increasingly intense shaking, Sun Luyao, as the spirit of the artifact, actually showed signs of being "thrown out" of the Infinite Mirror!</p><p></p><p>Without directly facing the power of the "Return" character technique, just being affected and targeted by the overflowing part, the "Infinite, Primordial Orientation" formation that Li Fan in the mirror had repaired with great effort began to slowly collapse.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's perception, the entire Infinite Mirror was like a burning piece of paper. The disappearance of its essential components led to its inevitable dissipation.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was also stunned for a moment, watching the Primordial Orientation formation spontaneously rebuild itself from the void.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"The protective arrays of each realm in the lower world were all created by the immortal realm and are also controlled by the immortal realm. As for the Infinite Mirror, it is an immortal artifact and is also subject to the constraints of the immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>"If we consider them as the elite soldiers of the immortal realm, then this 'Return' talisman is equivalent to having the power to command and dispatch troops. Whether this is due to the unique power of the 'Return' talisman itself or a common situation in the immortal realm is still unknown."</p><p></p><p>"Under normal circumstances, when summoned by the 'Return' talisman, they should lay down their arms and return. But now, with the immortal realm destroyed, the execution of the decree has been affected."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that this 'Return' talisman is fundamentally different from the other true immortal seal characters. It may even be a part of the cornerstone of the power system operation in the former immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered: "However, this conjecture inevitably raises a question."</p><p></p><p>"Since the 'Return' talisman is already in a semi-invalid state, where have the core centers of these protective arrays gone?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan gazed at the 'Return' talisman lying quietly in the core area.</p><p></p><p>Several possibilities had already emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The 'Return' talisman was written by some existence, flying towards the cores of the arrays in various realms. However, upon reaching the designated position, it found that the target had disappeared. So it has been hovering here, waiting for the target to appear.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, the 'Return' talisman successfully acted on the array cores, and the cores of the lower realms were successively annihilated and returned to the immortal realm. With the destruction of the immortal realm, the cores will reappear in the world. At this moment, however, an unknown existence intercepted and captured the cores.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"There are too few conditions at present. The truth cannot be determined yet."</p><p></p><p>"If the scope of the 'Return' talisman is limited to the original power of the immortal realm, although it is a true immortal seal character, its effect on me is limited." Li Fan couldn't help but shake his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"However, since this 'Return' talisman can shake immortal artifacts..."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if it has any effect on the Mysterious Yellow Mirror?"</p><p></p><p>Even if it doesn't cause substantial damage to the Mysterious Yellow Mirror, if it can cause it to crash for a period of time, it can still play a huge role at a critical moment.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that the current system of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, especially the defense measures of the alliance headquarters, are all closely related to the Mysterious Yellow Mirror without exception.</p><p></p><p>Once the Mysterious Yellow Mirror malfunctions, the impregnable Myriad Immortals Alliance will be full of loopholes in an instant.</p><p></p><p>But on the side of Holy Emperor Li Ping, it is completely different.</p><p></p><p>It can instantly turn the tide of the battlefield, with power equivalent to dozens of Dao-attained beings!</p><p></p><p>After the true body transmitted the contents of the 'Return' talisman to Holy Emperor Li Ping through a faint resonance.</p><p></p><p>The avatar in the Ash Miniature World also began the next step of action.</p><p></p><p>The 'Return' talisman was an unexpected delight.</p><p></p><p>His purpose in coming here was still to verify the previous conjecture.</p><p></p><p>"By this and that, there should also be a protective array in the Mysterious Yellow Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the protective array was left by the immortal realm and only exists in the original Mysterious Yellow Realm." Casually setting up an array to seal off the Ash Miniature World to prevent anyone from accidentally entering and coming into contact with the 'Return' talisman, Li Fan's avatar took the Infinite Mirror and returned to the Mysterious Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>He arrived at the location of the central four states of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The miniature image of the Mysterious Yellow Realm appeared in his mind, only the shadow of the original Mysterious Yellow.</p><p></p><p>Crisscrossing lines appeared on the model, which were the protective arrays inferred by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were some errors, the general location could still be locked.</p><p></p><p>Then, by using the power of the Infinite Mirror and spending some time, he could find the hidden core area of the protective array in the Mysterious Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>The only thing to worry about was that if the disturbance was too great, it would be noticed by the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p>

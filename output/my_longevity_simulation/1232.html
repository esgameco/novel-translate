        <h1>Chapter 1232</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Kong You, the Immortal Maiden, was a peerless beauty with many admirers in the Myriad Immortals Alliance. The miraculous effects of the Yin-Yang Jade were enough to drive all the cultivators in the world crazy.</p><p></p><p>Apart from her own uniqueness, Kong You seemed to have a hidden background.</p><p></p><p>It was secretly rumored among the high-ranking members of the Immortal Alliance that Kong You was the forbidden delicacy of a certain Dharma Transmitter. Not only was she born in a small world exclusive to the Dharma Transmitters, but even the half-piece of Heavenly Wonder within her body was implanted, all for the purpose of nurturing and harvesting her later.</p><p></p><p>There was no smoke without fire, and such rumors were not baseless.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly and Earthly Spirit [You Se] that Kong You used for her Dao convergence was one of the many raised and stored by the Myriad Immortals Alliance. Kong You quietly took it for her breakthrough in the Dao, and the Myriad Immortals Alliance never expressed any stance on this matter.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, more than thirty years ago, a cultivator surnamed Qin, who had just advanced to the Dao Convergence realm, fell in love with Kong You at first sight. After his ardent pursuit failed, he even planned to forcibly possess her through conspiracies and tricks. As a result, not only he but also the once-illustrious Qin family behind him vanished from the world and disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan was not intimidated by Kong You's possible special identity; instead, he became more determined to choose her as a sacrifice. At this moment, he came to his younger brother Sun Luyao, wanting to use the power of the Tianxuan Mirror to locate her current position.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, aren't you afraid of doing this..." Sun Luyao was a little puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"The current Myriad Immortals Alliance is completely unaware of the Great Awakening of the Holy Dynasty. I am merely inviting the world-renowned Immortal Maiden Kong You to visit a particularly unique small world within the Alliance's territory. What problem could there be?" Sun Luyuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"You can rest assured that someone like Immortal Maiden Kong You will never be in any life-threatening danger during the Great Awakening."</p><p></p><p>In fact, Sun Luyuan had some hidden thoughts that he did not explicitly tell his younger brother.</p><p></p><p>In addition to currying favor with the Holy Dynasty, he also wanted to use the power behind Immortal Maiden Kong You to test the strength of the Great Awakening. Indeed, everything they had seen and heard during the previous Great Awakening indicated the might of the Holy Dynasty, but there was still a need to witness it firsthand.</p><p></p><p>"If we can't even deal with a Dharma Transmitter, how can we compete with the Myriad Immortals Alliance?" Sun Luyuan silently said to himself.</p><p></p><p>What Sun Luyuan didn't know was that his every move was under the watchful eye of the Holy Emperor of the Great Awakening.</p><p></p><p>He thought he was being discreet, but how could he conceal anything from Li Fan, who had experienced countless reincarnations?</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Maiden Kong You." A peerlessly beautiful face instantly appeared in the mind of Holy Emperor Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>"It's also good. My few disciples are indeed not young anymore. If they can give birth to some heavenly prodigies for my Great Awakening, it would be a joyous occasion."</p><p></p><p>As for the existence behind Kong You, Li Ping indeed did not care much.</p><p></p><p>However, Sun Luyuan's self-righteous behavior made Li Ping give him a special mark.</p><p></p><p>"Today's actions will all be repaid."</p><p></p><p>Such a small matter was merely one of the countless scenes that flashed through the mind of the faceless Holy Emperor sitting on the throne.</p><p></p><p>It could not stir the slightest ripple in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's current main focus was still on [You Jie] and the deduction of the new law.</p><p></p><p>Ever since allocating a portion of the You people to make up for the energy deficiency in the Dark You Sea, Li Ping only felt that the degree of favor he received from the Mysterious Yellow Heaven was increasing.</p><p></p><p>Not long after helping Tian Yang converge with the Dao, the amount he could extort</p><p></p><p>The power of heaven and earth that was invoked was almost dozens of times more than before.</p><p></p><p>At the same time as grasping more authority, a certain inexplicable urging originating from the Xuanhuang Dao was appearing more and more frequently in Li Ping's mind.</p><p></p><p>This body was the key to the future of the countless subjects of the Great Enlightenment, so Li Ping naturally would not act rashly.</p><p></p><p>The scene of the Dao's perception flashed before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>A desolate desert landscape. As far as the eye could see, it was a hazy gray.</p><p></p><p>On top of a rocky mountain sat an old man.</p><p></p><p>Behind the old man was a coffin. Although it was only a scene of perception, Li Ping could still detect the decaying and evil aura emanating from the coffin.</p><p></p><p>It even made Li Ping feel slightly uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>"The sealed evil thoughts of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping naturally knew the reason for the Xuanhuang Dao's incessant urging.</p><p></p><p>With a part of itself sealed, the power of the Dao was greatly diminished. As a result, after the great tribulation of "The Dao Cannot Be Cultivated Together" thousands of years ago, it had never again released any means that could target cultivators.</p><p></p><p>If this lost part of its power could be found again, perhaps the situation would take a turn.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Even across a distance of billions of miles, Li Ping seemed to be able to feel the unsettling existence beneath the coffin lid.</p><p></p><p>"If this part of evil thoughts is allowed to return unchecked, after being sealed by cultivators for so many years and suppressed for a long time, the Xuanhuang Dao will certainly undergo extreme changes. This may not be a good thing for human cultivators or even the Xuanhuang Realm itself."</p><p></p><p>"But supplementing the power of the Xuanhuang Realm's Dao is indeed worth doing."</p><p></p><p>In almost an instant, the Holy Emperor Li Ping had already made a decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He would first absorb this part of the evil thoughts.</p><p></p><p>When he later remolded the universe and returned to the Xuanhuang Dao, this part of the power would naturally return to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Before that, whether this power was in his hands or in the hands of the Xuanhuang Realm's Dao...</p><p></p><p>In Li Ping's view, there was no difference.</p><p></p><p>With Li Ping's current strength, there were still some risks in trying to subdue the Xuanhuang evil thoughts. Especially that cultivator named Xu Ke who was guarding the Xuanhuang evil thoughts could not be understood with common sense.</p><p></p><p>So before making full preparations, Li Ping would not act rashly.</p><p></p><p>He simply ignored the urging of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there was an object worth learning from within the Great Enlightenment Holy Dynasty when it came to dealing with the power of the world.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>As the incarnation of the remnant souls from other cultivation realms, Yin Shangren had rich experience in struggling with the world's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>However, there seemed to be some taboo in this.</p><p></p><p>Several times when Li Ping sent inquiries, Yin Shangren unusually remained tight-lipped and did not respond.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he was indeed busy researching possible breakthroughs in the new law, so Li Ping did not hold it against him.</p><p></p><p>"The will of the world..."</p><p></p><p>Without Yin Shangren's help, Li Ping could only rely on himself to find a way to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>In his memory, there were still many remnant fragments from other cultivation realms in the Xuanhuang Realm that still retained their own consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps contacting them could yield some insights.</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Li Ping's figure flashed and arrived outside the entrance to the Great Enlightenment small world, the Congyu Sea.</p><p></p><p>At first glance, he saw the Nascent Soul of Heaven and Earth, Chiyan, about to be born in the world.</p><p></p><p>As if also sensing Li Ping's existence, Chiyan, who was still in the process of formation, conveyed a sense of confusion.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping did not interfere with the process of Chiyan's ignition of the sea.</p>

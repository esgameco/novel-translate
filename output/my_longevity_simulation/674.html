        <h1>Chapter 674</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Don't mention the regular disciples of the Medicine King Sect staring in amazement; even Liu San and Fang Zaiji, who noticed the commotion and hurried over, couldn't help but be slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"With the essence and appearance of Xu Ke, coupled with Mr. Bai's charm..."</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you just call him Xu Bai from now on!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at his doppelgänger, nodding very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai then gestured towards Li Fan, giving a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>The crowd below involuntarily gasped as they looked up.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, this is..." Liu San came to Li Fan's side and looked at Xu Bai with a hint of doubt in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>During this period, to prevent infiltrations by the White Mist Immortal Alliance cultivators, he had been keeping an eye on the entrance of Changsheng Valley. However, he didn't notice when this person came in at all, as if he had appeared out of thin air. Although he had a guess in his heart, Liu San still found it somewhat unbelievable. Thus, he sought confirmation from Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"This is not the place for discussion, follow me." Watching Fang Zaiji, who also seemed puzzled, Li Fan led both of them to a secluded room along with Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>"This is my refined doppelgänger," Xu Bai said directly.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Liu San seemed to understand, but then some confusion arose again.</p><p></p><p>"Although the art of refining doppelgängers is rare, with Young Master's abilities, acquiring one is not difficult. However, why does the doppelgänger you refined, Young Master, seem so... flashy?" </p><p></p><p>"Loud?" Without inquiring about the origin of Li Fan's doppelgänger technique, Liu San, instead, glanced at Xu Bai and asked with some difficulty in understanding.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled but did not answer, "I have my reasons. By the way, Mr. Fang, how is the refining of artifacts going?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji immediately reacted, "The white robes and folding fan, are they prepared for this doppelgänger of yours? I thought so, the style of this thing doesn't match with you, Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Artifacts at the Harmonization Level are not so easy to refine; it will take at least half a year. Besides..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji stared at Xu Bai for a moment, "The artifact I designed earlier seems a bit unsuitable for your doppelgänger, Sect Master. No, no, I must start over!"</p><p></p><p>The more he looked, the more Fang Zaiji felt that the white robes and folding fan, when worn by Xu Bai, lacked meaning.</p><p></p><p>So he had to rush off again to consider a new refining plan.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Li Fan stopped him in time.</p><p></p><p>"It has been almost three years since the sea of flames, it's time to let the disciples re-enter the world. Moreover, my plan also requires the cooperation of the disciples," Li Fan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Liu San and Fang Zaiji naturally did not object to this decision.</p><p></p><p>"However, re-entering the world also means risks. If a disciple unfortunately encounters an attack and their soul is searched, exposing the secrets of Changsheng Valley and the Beast Clan Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"How should we proceed?" Li Fan turned to the two Harmonization cultivators and asked.</p><p></p><p>"I'm only good at artifact refining, you should ask Old Liu about this," Fang Zaiji shrugged, appearing helpless.</p><p></p><p>However, Liu San did not decline. After pondering for a long time, he gave a solution, "A person's heart can be broken, but the hearts of many people are hard to break. Currently, within the Medicine King Ding, the Great Dream Spring and Autumn Formation is still operational. When disciples go out, as long as they connect a strand of their divine consciousness to it, if they encounter a forced soul search, it can trigger a counterattack within the formation. Unless the opponent's soul strength surpasses that of all the sleeping Medicine King Sect cultivators combined, don't even think about finding out anything from our disciples' minds."</p><p></p><p>"The Great Dream Spring and Autumn Formation, in fact, connects the thoughts of all the entrants in the formation, creating a vast dreamland. Thus, not only can they unite to resist external divine attacks, but they can also use the power of the dreamland to seal a portion of the memories of the cultivators within the formation. Just like how ordinary people in dreams are unaware of being in a dream. Moreover, in the future, even if the disciples are scattered across various locations in the Xuanhuang Realm, they can instantly contact each other through the Great Dream Spring and Autumn Formation without being noticed by others..."</p><p></p><p>Liu San detailed another amazing use of the Great Dream Spring and Autumn Formation to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Pleased with what he heard, Li Fan said, "Then I'll trouble Old Liu with this matter. When the disciples go out, they can handle it themselves. They just need to pretend to casually inquire about the news of the 'Tianling Flower' to others. The Tianling Flower is a unique product of the Tianling Province in the White Mist Immortal Alliance. Bestowed by the heavens, it is incredibly beautiful. However, after the Tianling Province War a few years ago, this item underwent strange changes..."</p><p></p><p>Liu San did not ask the reason for Li Fan's instructions, just firmly remembered them.</p><p></p><p>After explaining the necessary precautions, Liu San immediately proceeded with the task of connecting the disciples to the formation.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Li Fan took a step ahead and left Changsheng Valley.</p><p></p><p>Changsheng Valley was located within the White Mist Barrier at the junction of Luoyan Province and Luoying Province.</p><p></p><p>Avoiding patrolling cultivators, Li Fan quietly left the white mist and arrived inside the Tiancheng of Luoyan Province.</p><p></p><p>Although it was located within the White Mist Immortal Alliance's territory, Luoyan Province was not as prosperous as the Congyun Sea. In fact, the number of cultivators was slightly lesser. Most parts of Luoyan Province were barren and lacked resources.</p><p></p><p>But the main reason was the frequent unusual occurrences in Luoyan Province.</p><p></p><p>For instance, the "Mind Monkeys," familiar to Li Fan, had once had a massive outbreak here. Although the White Mist Immortal Alliance did not record this event in detail, in previous lives, Li Fan found that many Mind Monkey bones originated from Luoyan Province when he acquired them in bulk, leading to this speculation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Luoyan City was quite desolate.</p><p></p><p>Upon arriving at the long-unused Tianxuan Mirror, Li Fan's first action was to search for information about addictive elixirs.</p><p></p><p>Although Liu San had mentioned that the disciples had already inquired, indicating that the White Mist Immortal Alliance did not prohibit such substances, Li Fan knew that due to the presence of meritorious figures, many secrets were not known to ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>There were quite a few cases of taboo acts and mysterious deaths among cultivators in the White Mist Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>However, as this substance would influence Li Fan's future plans, he needed to understand the Alliance's stance.</p><p></p><p>His current status was still that of a merit-level "Innocent Body." Nevertheless, this did not stop Li Fan from seeking information.</p><p></p><p>Retrieving the "Ascend to Immortality Pill" from the jade bottle, Li Fan was about to put it up for sale in the market.</p><p></p><p>"Warning, the elixir you are trying to sell is a prohibited item. Your trading privileges have been temporarily frozen; please dispose of the prohibited item as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>"Warning..."</p><p></p><p>The sharp voice of the Tianxuan Mirror's alerts rang out, repeatedly warning.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, feigning great shock and innocence, said with a puzzled expression, "What? Prohibited item! Where did that come from?"</p><p></p><p>"It's just a normal elixir..."</p><p></p><p>The cold voice of the Tianxuan Mirror repeated, "Mind Ascend to Immortality Pill, item number 3,674 on the White Mist Immortal Alliance's list of prohibited items."</p><p></p><p>"Harm Level: High."</p>

            <p>"Practicing the same technique as me was one thing, but how can their cultivation level be higher than mine?"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was momentarily speechless and fell into extreme doubt about life. [Address of a website]</p><p></p><p>"This is trouble..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, various thoughts surged in He Zhenghao's mind.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, he decided to temporarily retreat to Wanxian Island.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to activate the teleportation array,</p><p></p><p>"I know you're hiding inside, why don't you dare to come out and meet me?" The other party's angry shout resounded again, sounding like thunder.</p><p></p><p>The whole Liuli Island seemed to tremble under this roar.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's face twitched, not daring to speak, just hurriedly opened the teleportation array.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that the person actually discovered his actions.</p><p></p><p>"Trying to escape? Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>A wave of fluctuations instantly enveloped the sky above Liuli Island.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was shocked to find out that the teleportation array on Liuli Island had lost its connection with Wanxian Island.</p><p></p><p>"Space blockade?!"</p><p></p><p>Cold sweat dripped from his forehead instantly.</p><p></p><p>However, in an instant, He Zhenghao reacted.</p><p></p><p>"No, just by some means, temporarily affecting the connection of the teleportation array nodes..."</p><p></p><p>Just as he secretly let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly noticed that the cultivator who had suddenly come to confront him had turned into a stream of light and dashed straight towards the protective array below.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao felt relieved, "So it's a brute! My Great Mountains and Stars Formation is not easy to deal with. Even if you are a Golden Core cultivator..."</p><p></p><p>Just as he was thinking this, something that stunned him happened. [The website address]</p><p></p><p>The other party actually treated the grand formation as nothing, swaggering and flew straight in.</p><p></p><p>The flying route seemed random, but often passed through the weakest points of the formation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the speed was extremely fast, in an instant, before He Zhenghao could react.</p><p></p><p>He landed in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The person stared at him coldly, his eyes filled with killing intent: "Did you steal the techniques of my sect, kid?"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's mind went blank instantly.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have time to ponder how the other could easily break his proud Great Mountains and Stars Formation.</p><p></p><p>As if substantial murderous intent enveloped him, He Zhenghao's heart began to beat uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"Misunderstanding! It's definitely a misunderstanding!"</p><p></p><p>"Companion, please don't act!"</p><p></p><p>Faced with the threat of death, He Zhenghao cried out continuously.</p><p></p><p>"Companion?" The ferocity in the other's eyes intensified.</p><p></p><p>"A mere Foundation Establishment cultivator, how dare you address me, a Golden Core Grandmaster, as a companion?"</p><p></p><p>"Nowadays, cultivators are so ignorant?"</p><p></p><p>A much stronger pressure that transcended the usual Golden Core cultivators suddenly emanated from him.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao felt as if a mountain was pressing down on his shoulders, his knees weakened, almost kneeling down on the spot.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao felt grievance in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Never mind a Golden Core cultivator, even if it was a Yuanying cultivator, I, He Zhenghao, should still be addressed as a companion by them!</p><p></p><p>But with the wicked in front of him, for the sake of his own life, He Zhenghao had to temporarily submit to the other's power. [Address of a website]</p><p></p><p>Suppressing an ugly smile, He Zhenghao struggled to say, "Misunderstanding, it really is a misunderstanding!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior, let's talk it out!"</p><p></p><p>The other scanned the surroundings with a cold gaze, temporarily retracting his pressure.</p><p></p><p>"I ask, you answer!"</p><p></p><p>"If you lie to me..."</p><p></p><p>"Death!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the other's words, He Zhenghao couldn't help but feel a jump in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Nodding incessantly like a little chicken, indicating that he understood.</p><p></p><p>"How did you come by your 'Mountain Sitting Technique'?" the other inquired.</p><p></p><p>Before He Zhenghao could finish his sentence, he heard another question from the other.</p><p></p><p>"Cave? Where is it located? Why does it have the inheritance of my sect?"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao quickly disclosed the location and internal structure of that cave he had entered initially.</p><p></p><p>The other squinted his eyes, remained silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>He then unexpectedly spoke out some details about the cave's interior, asking He Zhenghao if it was true or not.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was overjoyed and nodded quickly.</p><p></p><p>Perceiving the other's gradually calming killing intent, He Zhenghao couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the other seemingly lost in recollection, he hesitantly asked, "I've observed the senior's words and deeds, all different from ordinary people."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if the senior has just woken up from a long slumber?"</p><p></p><p>It wasn't surprising that He Zhenghao would make such a guess.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, which cultivator would still keep mentioning their sect?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there were instances of ancient cultivators who had been asleep for thousands of years awakening.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao didn't find this very strange.</p><p></p><p>He just thought he was a little unlucky.</p><p></p><p>The other didn't directly confirm, but his expression became somewhat serious.</p><p></p><p>"I actually wanted to ask you, what has happened in these years?"</p><p></p><p>"Why do cultivation techniques suddenly produce strange reactions?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems like the world has become different..."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao became more certain of his speculation.</p><p></p><p>He then meticulously described to him the transmission of the Heavenly Sovereign's Law, the arrival of the Great Calamity, the various events that occurred in the Xuanhuang Realm, and the current situation of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The other's face kept changing as he listened.</p><p></p><p>And in the midst of He Zhenghao's continuous probing, he finally began to understand the identity of the other.</p><p></p><p>He was called Li Fan, a cultivator from the ancient Tianji Sect.</p><p></p><p>He had once fallen into a long slumber due to an accident.</p><p></p><p>It was even through a sudden intuition that Li Fan came to Liuli Island.</p><p></p><p>And finding out that He Zhenghao, who practiced the same 'Mountain Sitting Technique,' was not a disciple of the Tianji Sect, led to the scene of questioning.</p><p></p><p>"How did the senior discern that I am not a disciple of the Tianji Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Although He Zhenghao lamented his misfortune in his heart, he still had doubts.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sneered, "After a thousand years, have cultivators become so ignorant?"</p><p></p><p>"Your question is like asking how a cultivator can tell at a glance that a demonic beast is not human."</p><p></p><p>"As a Tianji Sect cultivator, who emphasizes the unity of heaven and man, the sect's internal techniques are closely related to Qi sensations. Naturally, I have secret techniques to distinguish this."</p><p></p><p>As He Zhenghao listened to the other's disdainful tone, his old face blushed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to say something more, Li Fan suddenly stared at him intently.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you..." He Zhenghao couldn't help but feel a little nervous.</p><p></p><p>"How long have you been practicing the 'Mountain Sitting Technique'?" Li Fan inquired.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was slightly stunned, "For over a hundred years..."</p><p></p><p>"Such a divine technique as the 'Mountain Sitting Technique,' and you've been practicing for so long, still stuck at the Foundation Establishment level?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at He Zhenghao in suspicion, "Could it be that you also suffered injuries and fell in cultivation realm?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, He Zhenghao's face immediately turned red.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you misunderstand, this 'Mountain Sitting Technique'..."</p><p></p><p>He was about to defend himself, but then he suddenly remembered that the person before him was the ancestor who cultivated the 'Mountain Sitting Technique.'</p><p></p><p>For a moment, he couldn't say a word.</p><p></p><p>Stammering, he stood there dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan resolved his dilemma for him.</p><p></p><p>As if recalling something important, he suddenly realized, "That's right, you can't sense the Heavenly Mechanism Law. No wonder your cultivation progress has been so slow."</p><p></p><p>"Relying solely on 'sitting on the mountain' without 'sitting on the immortal.' It's difficult, difficult, difficult!"</p>

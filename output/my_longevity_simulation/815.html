            <p>"It feels a bit eerie here," Shang Tianci muttered softly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also sensed that there seemed to be an unusual aura in this valley.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang took a swift step forward, blocking in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan followed closely behind, carefully observing the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The bottom of the valley was located at the foot of a thousand-zhang-high mountain, never seeing sunlight all year round, and was shrouded in a miasma.</p><p></p><p>The flora and fauna living here were also different from those on Mount Taixu.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they had suddenly arrived in another world.</p><p></p><p>"This miasma can actually interfere with divine sense."</p><p></p><p>Walking in the valley, not only did they have to be careful with their steps and had obstructed vision, but even their divine sense could not fully perceive the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>After walking for a while, Shang Tianci suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>"The ringing sound has disappeared."</p><p></p><p>He abruptly turned his head back.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, and based on the warning sound of [Zhu Xuan], he roughly defined an area in the valley.</p><p></p><p>It was only about three zhang in size, and could be seen at a glance.</p><p></p><p>But obviously there were no suspicious remnants of the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Shang Tianci looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual energy shot out, eliminating all the weeds and animals in this area.</p><p></p><p>After wiping away a thick layer of silt, a smooth stone slab was revealed.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan touched the stone slab and felt it was a bit familiar.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he remembered. It was not in the Xuanhuang Xianshi, but in the Yunxian Realm, in the scene of [Ning Yuan Picking Longevity Fruit].</p><p></p><p>In the small house where Mr. Bai lived in Ningyuan City, he had seen a similar stone slab.</p><p></p><p>The Hua Dao Stone emitted a blue light, recalling the scene at that time.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression instantly became a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>These two stone slabs could not be said to be very similar.</p><p></p><p>They could only be said to be exactly the same.</p><p></p><p>"Juexian Stone Slab."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..." A guess surged in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>He ordered Tian Yang to lift the stone slab, while he himself flew far away to avoid it.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan fly down.</p><p></p><p>It was not much different from the scene he had experienced in his memory.</p><p></p><p>In a not-so-large space, a faceless stone statue stood against the wall.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to the isolation of the Juexian Stone Slab, the long brown wooden table in the middle still looked the same as it did back then, even after thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Even in the air, one could still faintly smell the faint scent of blood.</p><p></p><p>The wooden box at the corner of the table, the transparent jars placed around the walls.</p><p></p><p>As well as the twenty-eight [Beast Race] corpses buried under the corner of the wall.</p><p></p><p>All of these undoubtedly showed that this was the underground secret room of Mr. Bai's house that Li Fan had visited in the Yunxian Realm!</p><p></p><p>The things that existed in the Yunxian Realm had inexplicably appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This discovery suddenly made Li Fan feel an absurd sense of space-time change and intertwining.</p><p></p><p>"Mount Taixu was once Ningyuan City?"</p><p></p><p>"In that case, the Zixiao Sect should be not far from here?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered, and according to the information in Ximen Yu's "Ancient and Modern Landscape Examination", he quickly made a comparison.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't match."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Li Fan frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>According to the intelligence from Jiao Xiuyuan in the previous life, the ruins of the Zixi</p><p>Thousands of years later, they were unexpectedly separated by mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>"It cannot be explained by the changes of mountains and rivers. It's as if someone deliberately cut and separated it."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew before that the current Xuanhuang Realm was formed by the fusion of the Xuanhuang Realm itself and several other worlds.</p><p></p><p>"Now it seems that in addition to fusion, there is also transformation."</p><p></p><p>"At the end of the 115th world, after it was destroyed by a glance of a true immortal, could that earth-shattering roar be issued by the Dharma?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Xuanhuang Realm has some special significance to her."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>His thoughts gradually calmed down. To be cautious, Li Fan ordered Tianyang to dig three feet deep here to ensure that nothing was missed.</p><p></p><p>"This faceless Xuantian God Statue is made entirely of absolute immortal stone. It's quite valuable."</p><p></p><p>"But instead of selling it, it's better to use it as the facade of the [Myriad Realms United Association]. After all, there may only be this one Xuantian God Statue left under the sky."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also thought of the Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect who was still sleeping under the Ziyan Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe it can even work wonders when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>As the statue was put away, the sensing of the Zhu Xuan Secret Technique also returned to calm.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, what is that decaying statue? It looks a bit creepy." Shang Tianci couldn't help asking.</p><p></p><p>"This involves the secrets of ancient times. The history is long, even before the rise of the Dharma Venerable. You will know in the future." Li Fan showed a mysterious smile, saying half and hiding half, successfully arousing Shang Tianci's interest.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Li Fan's mind moved, and he simply cut and took away the entire underground secret room.</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't care, and later brought Shang Tianci back to [Lingmu Realm].</p><p></p><p>On the way, when passing through the border of the state, they encountered cultivators patrolling. Fortunately, Li Fan had the [One Hand Covering the Sky] secret technique and was not noticed by anyone.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Shang, what do you think of this place?" </p><p></p><p>Standing on the top of the spirit tree, Li Fan asked Shang Tianci beside him.</p><p></p><p>"It's good, but a little..."</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary."</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci held back for a long time and said this word.</p><p></p><p>"Yes. It's almost an endless plain with few beautiful mountains and rivers. It can't be compared with the Xuanhuang Realm where wonders appear frequently." Li Fan said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Shang Tianci was stunned. Obviously, he didn't understand the meaning of Li Fan's words.</p><p></p><p>"Your Purple Gold Gourd can manifest the wonders of Xuanhuang, right? Just manifest them one by one in this Lingmu Realm. Even if the scale is not as large as before, it doesn't matter."</p><p></p><p>"Let's recreate Xuanhuang in this small world!"</p><p></p><p>"How shocking it will be!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan murmured.</p><p></p><p>And Shang Tianci also couldn't help breathing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go right now!"</p><p></p><p>The honest young man immediately patted his chest and promised.</p><p></p><p>"Before manifesting, you need to plan the landscape orientation."</p><p></p><p>"The Tree People's leader has lived for many years, you can consult her if you have any uncertainties." Li Fan didn't forget to remind.</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"With Xiao Shang's help, our [Myriad Realms United Association] is becoming more and more like something."</p><p></p><p>"As long as we wait to complete the transaction with the Five Elders Association and have the materials ready. We can officially start construction."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was a little complacent in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if it is possible to refine this Lingmu Realm into a portable treasure."</p><p></p><p>"And then use anchor points to replace and bind with Huan Zhen."</p><p></p><p>"A solid and stable base, at present, seems to be quite important."</p>

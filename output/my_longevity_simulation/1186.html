        <h1>Chapter 1186</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This made the material of the flag magic treasure itself also ordinary and sparse. In this ocean of relics, it didn't have the value to be specially selected.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be for the power of the True Immortal seal characters on it, whose side effects have already faded?" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart moved, and he suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>Gently stroking the flag, he sensed a familiar aura.</p><p></p><p>"Chaotic Character Technique..."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that with the passage of time, even the power of True Immortal seal characters has ultimately reached its end."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the complete character "Chaos" appeared in his mind. After a moment, the Holy Fetus Li Fan's hand holding the flag stiffened slightly.</p><p></p><p>Because he discovered that just now, the last bit of power attached to the flag had also completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Instead, his own comprehension of the "Chaos" character technique had suddenly become a little deeper!</p><p></p><p>This progress was very subtle.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan's own understanding of the Chaos character was also stuck at the most basic level of copying, so it seemed relatively more obvious. It was captured by Li Fan in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"It can actually become a material for enlightenment?"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan couldn't help but feel a little shocked in his heart. At this time, looking at the countless floating relics here, his eyes were suddenly different.</p><p></p><p>"But unfortunately, it seems that only relics where the power of True Immortal seal characters is about to dissipate can be used as enlightenment nourishment. Otherwise, there would be a risk of being injured instead. The method to distinguish their differences..."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan cast his gaze towards that hidden hiding place.</p><p></p><p>For most of the next half year, Li Fan had been hiding in the dark. Every time a cultivator went out to collect relics, he would do the same.</p><p></p><p>He sent out his avatar to attach to those collected relics.</p><p></p><p>One was to study how the alarm was triggered, and the other was to take the opportunity to obtain all the enlightenment relics of True Immortal seal characters.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Realm, in the sea of consciousness of the original body, the End Separation Disk was going all out to analyze the unknown formation.</p><p></p><p>And through the study of the eight relics he obtained, the Holy Fetus Li Fan became more convinced of his judgment.</p><p></p><p>The other surviving civilizations in this dark star sea collected these relics in order to study and even utilize the power of True Immortal seal characters.</p><p></p><p>"To actually have a means to distinguish the degree of this power..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems the strength here cannot be underestimated."</p><p></p><p>Among these eight relics, three came from "Chaos" and two came from "Hunger".</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining two, they were influenced by other True Immortal seal characters that were currently unknown.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan also discovered the differences among them.</p><p></p><p>He had personally seen the original forms of the two True Immortal seal characters, Chaos and Hunger. Even if they were imitations written by someone unknown, he still had a general understanding of their origins after all. Therefore, he could easily absorb the residual power on the enlightenment relics and transform it into enlightenment nourishment.</p><p></p><p>The situation with the other two was very different.</p><p></p><p>Just relying on the residual power that was about to dissipate, it was very difficult to even sense their properties, let alone further comprehend their essence.</p><p></p><p>In terms of utilization, compared to the characters Chaos and Hunger, the efficiency was tens of thousands of times worse.</p><p></p><p>"And if starting from knowing nothing, groping in the dark and slowly exploring and researching on your own..."</p><p></p><p>"It would be as difficult as climbing to the sky! Using mortal power to try to explore the power of True Immortals..."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Li Fan was pensive in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Not every cultivator can have enough opportunities to be fortunate enough to personally see</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The true meaning of the original source of the True Immortal Seal Script."</p><p></p><p>"That Chaos Character Formula is hidden within the folded maze in the white fog, which ordinary people find difficult to encounter in their entire lives. As for the Hunger Character Formula, it is even engraved on the Immortal Ruins! Seeing it means death. If I didn't have the words of Huan Zhen, I wouldn't be able to grasp it at all."</p><p></p><p>"There's also the [Absence] Character Formula, which I discovered by chance inside a golden skull in a small destroyed world..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the unknown civilization hidden in the shadows, and a thought naturally arose.</p><p></p><p>"The so-called rare goods are worth keeping. The value of these original true meanings in this civilization may be even higher than I imagined."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>More than 30 days later, the Doomsday Detachment Disc finally broke the means that triggered the warning.</p><p></p><p>To be on the safe side, the Holy Fetus Li Fan didn't directly risk himself.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he still used his avatar to probe.</p><p></p><p>In the past six months or so, although he had cut off many avatar souls, the vicinity of this civilization's hiding place seemed to contain a strange power.</p><p></p><p>It could withstand all kinds of bizarre invasions in the void, so the Holy Fetus Li Fan's recovery speed was also very fast.</p><p></p><p>Cutting off avatar souls had become only a little painful for him.</p><p></p><p>The Doomsday Detachment Disc was indeed trustworthy.</p><p></p><p>This time, the relic attached to the avatar successfully passed the inspection and entered the passage.</p><p></p><p>The sensing became much weaker, but it could still vaguely perceive the situation inside the hiding place.</p><p></p><p>The three-person team that went out to collect relics continued to drag them forward with black ropes, passing through the inspections of three passage defenses before finally entering the safe zone.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't wait to take off the armor on their bodies and complained incessantly.</p><p></p><p>"There are fewer and fewer useful relics near the Immortal Boat. This time we only found so few..."</p><p></p><p>"The next time we carry out a mission, I'm afraid we'll have to leave the safe zone."</p><p></p><p>"We've been staying here for a hundred years? I don't know why we haven't set off for so long."</p><p></p><p>"It is said that there was originally a plan to change the berthing location, but some time ago..."</p><p></p><p>The three of them avoided talking about it very tactfully.</p><p></p><p>Taking this time's harvest, they continued walking towards the depths of the hiding place.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Boat?" Li Fan heard their words and pondered.</p><p></p><p>After passing through a long and narrow, dim passage, the view ahead suddenly opened up.</p><p></p><p>They actually arrived in a beautiful mountain valley with clear waters.</p><p></p><p>An old man with white hair in front was holding a strange magic weapon similar to a book, waiting for the three of them.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see this time..." The old man originally had a smile on his face, but immediately turned gloomy after seeing the number of relics behind the three.</p><p></p><p>"Forgive me, Elder. This time out, our luck was really bad." Among the three, the cultivator who looked the oldest said with a bitter smile.</p><p></p><p>The old man shook his head, sighed, and in the end didn't say much.</p><p></p><p>The book-like magic weapon in his hand emitted a beam of light, enveloping all the relics.</p><p></p><p>As the light beam retracted, it seemed to have completed the inspection of the relics.</p><p></p><p>"Try to make up for it next time."</p><p></p><p>"You are all clear about the situation of the Immortal Boat. If we lack one or two pieces like this every time, it's fine in the short term. But if it goes on for a long time, won't we all suffer?" The old man snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>The older cultivator didn't refute, only nodding repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Help me send the relics to the [Severed Immortal Building]." The old man instructed again.</p>

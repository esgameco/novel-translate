            <p>Chapter 1010: Backup from a Hundred Years Ago</p><p></p><p>What is cultivation?</p><p></p><p>It is something abstract, yet truly exists. </p><p></p><p>Each cultivator practices different techniques, but ultimately reaches the same destination. However, they are tainted with the unique imprints of their respective techniques.</p><p></p><p>The three golden figures in front of Li Fan were the size of ordinary humans. Like the glowing cube encountered before, they were purely materialized creations of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they were the condensation of an immeasurable sum of cultivation that had reached its extreme.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, Li Fan also keenly sensed that within these three golden figures, there were different unique auras.</p><p></p><p>Each was different, but they all had a prominent feature, which was like a precise mechanical creation, forming a unique structure.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was certain that if he was slightly careless and triggered the mechanism on the golden figures, they would likely execute some predetermined task in a set manner.</p><p></p><p>"Among them, there is no trace of spiritual power operation. It is entirely formed by the accumulation of cultivation itself."</p><p></p><p>"Is it to achieve complete concealment?"</p><p></p><p>"Such exquisite application is truly somewhat unimaginable."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, then sent out a thread of spiritual power into the air and retreated to a safe position.</p><p></p><p>Then, using that thread of spiritual power as a fuse, he fiercely pierced it into one of the golden figures.</p><p></p><p>It was like a pile of explosive barrels being suddenly detonated, and an extremely fierce and unstable aura erupted.</p><p></p><p>Then the golden light quickly converged, with only the eyes still having uncontrollable light overflowing.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could thus clearly see the appearance of the golden figure.</p><p></p><p>What surprised him was that this golden figure, completely constructed from pure cultivation, actually looked almost exactly the same as the Dharma Heavenly Venerable!</p><p></p><p>Or rather, it was built according to the Heavenly Venerable statues of the Myriad Immortals Alliance spread all over the place!</p><p></p><p>After the golden figure awakened, there was no momentary confusion. It seemed to follow preset steps, scanning the supplies stored in this space with its gaze.</p><p></p><p>Its hands pointed in the air, and streaks of golden light were separated from its body, flying onto different objects. After being tainted with the golden light of cultivation, those originally dead objects suddenly seemed to have spirituality.</p><p></p><p>They quickly self-assembled into a rough human form.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, the No. 1 golden figure looked at its two still-sleeping companions, and shot a beam of light from its left and right eyes respectively, shining on them.</p><p></p><p>The No. 2 and No. 3 golden figures were thus activated one after another.</p><p></p><p>The No. 2 golden figure shattered in form, turning into a viscous golden liquid and flying into the assembled vague human form of the No. 1 golden figure.</p><p></p><p>As for the No. 3 golden figure, it turned into a beam of light, drilling out from the ground and flying to an unknown place.</p><p></p><p>After absorbing the golden liquid, the human form became much more vivid.</p><p></p><p>However, it seemed to lack its own intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Until not long after, the No. 3 golden figure returned, stuffing a black, constantly jumping unknown object into it.</p><p></p><p>The breath of life suddenly descended.</p><p></p><p>And as if to verify Li Fan's guess.</p><p></p><p>After the golden liquid wriggled bizarrely, it gradually condensed into a solid form.</p><p></p><p>A somewhat strange, hoarse voice that sounded like metal friction appeared underground: "I... am I dead?"</p><p></p><p>There was some confusion and unwillingness in the tone.</p><p></p><p>The Ling Yuan Sect Master looked at the two golden figures guarding beside him, and actually showed some surprise: "Forged Golden Figures? Did I really succeed in..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"How could this thing be produced? Damn it..." </p><p></p><p>Having come back to life, the Lingyuan Sect Leader was not delighted, but instead felt a bit anxious and uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"According to the progress in my memory, it would take at least a hundred more years of research to achieve a qualitative breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>"Right, there should be a time crown track here."</p><p></p><p>After some searching, the Lingyuan Sect Leader indeed found what he wanted in the corner.</p><p></p><p>However, after reading it, his face changed dramatically: "328 years later? So much time has passed, how could it be possible to still restore this memory backup of mine?"</p><p></p><p>After a brief moment of panic, the young Lingyuan Sect Leader quickly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"Based on my level of prudence in doing things, it's impossible that I didn't back up my memory for over 300 years. But the resurrection still has to rely on me..."</p><p></p><p>"The only plausible explanation is that an unexpected catastrophe occurred. Causing all the memory backups after this to be destroyed."</p><p></p><p>"Hiss..."</p><p></p><p>The Lingyuan Sect Leader took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Lingyuan Sect must have perished along with me. It's indeed too difficult to do great things by relying on a group of rabble."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, the Lingyuan Sect Leader, as if to verify his conclusion, began trying to activate the Cangsheng Lingyuan Cultivation Technique.</p><p></p><p>To his great surprise, the cultivation was unimpeded and exceptionally smooth.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he vaguely sensed that as many as millions of people were simultaneously cultivating the Cangsheng Lingyuan Technique!</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" The Lingyuan Sect Leader instantly became unsettled.</p><p></p><p>He frowned and paced back and forth.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he speculated a possibility: a traitor appeared in the sect, not only executed him, but also cleared all his memory backups.</p><p></p><p>Only the most primitive copy, perhaps due to its ancient age, was safely preserved.</p><p></p><p>But this speculation made the Lingyuan Sect Leader even more puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Even the deepest hidden secrets could be leaked. In the end, I trusted the wrong person and was directly harmed to death..."</p><p></p><p>The Lingyuan Sect Leader racked his brains but couldn't figure out the reason.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he let out a long sigh: "Before figuring out what exactly happened, I can only keep a low profile."</p><p></p><p>"But anyway, I've been living like this before, so I'm used to it."</p><p></p><p>"I finally escaped to a cultivation world that survived the calamity, but it's in this ghostly state. Damn it..."</p><p></p><p>The Lingyuan Sect Leader complained, and his body composed of parts and physical cultivation changed accordingly.</p><p></p><p>His arms transformed into long tubes, piercing into the square wall beneath his feet.</p><p></p><p>From the flashing golden light in the tubes, it could be seen that the Lingyuan Sect Leader was absorbing the cultivation stored in the square.</p><p></p><p>And his realm aura also soared from the initial Qi Refining stage right after rebirth.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, over the years, I have accumulated a considerable amount of cultivation for backup."</p><p></p><p>"It should quickly restore my original strength." The Lingyuan Sect Leader said.</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment, he was stunned to find that he suddenly lost control of his body.</p><p></p><p>Realizing he was under attack, he was about to order the two Golden Men guards.</p><p></p><p>But before he could issue the command, he saw a stone statue emanating a holy and compassionate aura occupying his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Compassion in the mortal world..."</p><p></p><p>Captivated in mind and spirit, all his thoughts were interrupted in an instant.</p><p></p><p>When he came to his senses, he still didn't know where he was.</p><p></p><p>When he tried to contact the two Golden Men guards again, he found that he couldn't contact them at all.</p><p></p><p>The Lingyuan Sect Leader couldn't help but feel a sinking feeling in his heart.</p>

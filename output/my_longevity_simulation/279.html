            <p>Finally, he stared at the little poem at the end of the Kung Fu, pondering.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Dao is simple, and creation is always selfless."</p><p></p><p>"The true law is spread throughout the world, only those who have the destiny know it."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Muttering the poem in his mouth, Ye Feipeng's eyes became brighter and brighter.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it is the so-called "The Great Tao is the simplest, the true transmission of a sentence.</p><p></p><p>This "Creation and Baking Furnace Technique" looks so simple, but if you really take it lightly, then you are making a big mistake!</p><p></p><p>Little Fatty became confident again.</p><p></p><p>"Fuxian" is an organization that has existed since ancient times, and although it has declined somewhat, it has a deep heritage after all."</p><p></p><p>"How can its treasures be compared to ordinary goods?"</p><p></p><p>"Creation, creation. It is truly a blessing for me, Ye Feipeng, to obtain this technique!"</p><p></p><p>While his heart was agitated, Little Fatty crushed the jade and left the Advance Realm.</p><p></p><p>His body rapidly sped up and disappeared into a sea trench near the deserted island, practicing according to the method in the "Creation and Baking Furnace Technique".</p><p></p><p>"Calling upon the power of the secret stash within the body ......"</p><p></p><p>Ye Feipeng closed his eyes and secretly sensed the power that was hidden within his body.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, it was as if he had fallen into hibernation, and the aura waves in his body fell silent.</p><p></p><p>In this way, more than a month has passed.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Ye Feipeng's face suddenly emerged a trace of inexplicable redness.</p><p></p><p>On top of his head, the image of a Peng also appeared at the right time, with a loud and clear roar. New 𝟔𝟗 book bar → 𝟔𝟗𝐬𝐡𝐮𝐱.𝐜 𝐨𝐦</p><p></p><p>"Pfft!"</p><p></p><p>A mouthful of blood spurted out, and the brown wings behind his back opened violently.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a huge energy had suddenly appeared inside his body.</p><p></p><p>It kept surging, and wherever it passed, huge bulges appeared on the surface of the skin.</p><p></p><p>It looked like a sarcoma constantly moving around the body.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Feipeng's face was not surprised but happy.</p><p></p><p>"The power of the secret stash is indeed extraordinary! I originally thought that I had already developed all the potential of the Corsair bloodline."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't realize that it's still too early!"</p><p></p><p>Just when Ye Feipeng was excited in his heart, another wave of vast power suddenly appeared in his body.</p><p></p><p>As if being hit hard, the little fat man again spat out a large mouthful of blood.</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit too much for me to handle at once."</p><p></p><p>The body has been impacted by this huge force some deformation, Ye Feipeng face suddenly serious.</p><p></p><p>"We need to refine this power in a hurry."</p><p></p><p>"The body is like an oven, the creation is a work of art. The secret stash is like carbon, everything is copper!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to the key concepts in the technique, Ye Feipeng's eyes flashed with a brilliant light.</p><p></p><p>His obese and somewhat deformed body suddenly heated up at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!</p><p></p><p>A rumbling sound like the impact of a giant hammer faintly emerged from within his body.</p><p></p><p>The moment the sound sounded, Ye Feipeng's body could not help but tremble violently. The new 𝟔𝟗𝟗𝟨𝟫sʜᴜx.ᴄᴏᴍ</p><p></p><p>But the bulge that kept traveling around his body seemed to shrink by a few points because of this fierce hammer.</p><p></p><p>Although it was not obvious, Ye Feipeng could clearly feel the changes in himself.</p><p></p><p>"Good!</p><p></p><p>"Again!"</p><p></p><p>There was a glint in his eye.</p><p></p><p>Another hammer.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Under the constant succession of tamping blows, those two majestic masses of Mizo power were slowly absorbed by Ye Feipeng's body.</p><p></p><p>The strength of his physical body was once again strengthened.</p><p></p><p>Within a short period of time, it had gained about one-tenth of its strength.</p><p></p><p>Just as Ye Feipeng was feeling ecstatic about this change, his body that was emitting a scorching light like an oven.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the next second it would not be able to withstand it and break apart.</p><p></p><p>Ye Feipeng's face changed abruptly.</p><p></p><p>However, before he could react, a blue light suddenly bloomed in his dantian.</p><p></p><p>The deep blue color wandered in and out of the red mango, seemingly having a consciousness of its own, constantly repairing Ye Feipeng's injuries.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a vast number of small blue particles of light, from the sea near the ditch in the sea, and then after towards Ye Feipeng surged.</p><p></p><p>It is not only the pure force of water attribute.</p><p></p><p>Also contains pure life energy.</p><p></p><p>Nourished by this, the little fat man's oven body stabilized again.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful!</p><p></p><p>"In the gong method, it is said that the process of tempering the body should not be rushed. Otherwise, you'll hurt yourself."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that I was too hasty in my first practice and used too much of my hidden power."</p><p></p><p>"My body is overloaded, it's a bit of a deficiency."</p><p></p><p>"But I didn't realize that the Vicissitudes of the Sea could actually repair my physical injuries."</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't this mean that ......"</p><p></p><p>The more I think about it, the more excited I get.</p><p></p><p>The sound of the sledgehammer tampering reappeared.</p><p></p><p>Ye Feipeng, having tasted the sweetness, couldn't wait to continue practicing.</p><p></p><p>In the Tian Xuan mirror, Li Fan, who had watched this process from beginning to end, could not help but let out an exclamation.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the power of the Peng bloodline?"</p><p></p><p>"The strength of the body of an ancient demonic beast is really not comparable to that of a human being."</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan gave Ye Feipeng the "Creation and Baking Furnace Technique", it was actually because he wanted to test it out.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see if there would be any changes when this method of mobilizing the Tantric Cultivation was combined with the bloodline of the demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>The result was also a bit out of Li Fan's expectation.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the body mass of the demonic beast bloodline was already beyond that of ordinary human beings, Ye Feipeng's tolerance level of the "Creation and Baking Furnace Technique" Hammering was too much stronger than that of Li Fan's doppelgänger.</p><p></p><p>When the body reaches a certain strength, only then can the hammering take place.</p><p></p><p>However, in Ye Feipeng's case, the step of strengthening was directly omitted.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, he is hammering himself while simultaneously strengthening his physical body.</p><p></p><p>It was risky, but the effect was also much stronger.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan could not learn it.</p><p></p><p>If he were to force himself to do so, then his body would not be able to withstand the hammering and would be shattered, and he would die.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Ye Feipeng can do this.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the strong physical body brought by the demonic beast bloodline, the help of the vicissitudes of the sea beads is also essential.</p><p></p><p>The pure life energy is also a great tonic for the Pengs.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't realize that you still have the ability to heal wounds, you are really more kind than your own son."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly in his heart.</p><p></p><p>When he first built his foundation with the Vicissitude Sea Pearl, he never enjoyed this kind of treatment.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Regardless of what Li Fan thought, it did not affect Ye Feipeng's cultivation progress.</p><p></p><p>There was absolutely no need to worry about his body being harmed, making it possible for him to carry out physical body hammering almost recklessly.</p><p></p><p>Another month or so had passed, and Ye Feipeng had not only absorbed all of the two groups of secret power that he had invoked earlier.</p><p></p><p>And originally obese body, also in this again and again under the hammering, become gradually thin down.</p><p></p><p>When he was as skinny as a wood, a few shares of the power of the secret stash once again bombarded the emergence.</p><p></p><p>The body inflated like a balloon.</p><p></p><p>The hammer rumbled, and Ye Feipeng's strength soared in this cycle.</p>

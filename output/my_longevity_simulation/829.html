        <h1>Chapter 829</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Although Li Fan said that he believed Senior Sister Zhao would never do anything underhanded, after leaving Jiushan Prefecture, he did not directly return to the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he quietly returned to Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>Except for the True Temptation Fruit and other treasures containing the power of the Celestial Venerable, all other regular supplies were handed over to his avatar Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>He planned to use the Tianxuan Mirror to "launder" these items: sell them out and buy them back, removing any possible traces on them.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even keep the invaluable Kongming Stone, which could be used to refine spatial magic treasures.</p><p></p><p>Although doing this would cause some loss of contribution points, it was still worth it to reduce the risk of being targeted by the Eternal Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Of course, as the Great War between the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders Society was currently underway, in order to avoid suspicion, it might take some time for Ji Shaoli to launder these supplies.</p><p></p><p>However, with the help of the other members of the Congyun Sea Mutual Aid Association, this process would not be too slow.</p><p></p><p>"As for those supreme treasures containing the power of the Celestial Venerable, involving the power of other Celestial Venerables, it wouldn't be so easy for Senior Sister Zhao to tamper with them even if she wanted to."</p><p></p><p>These were all pure creations of the Dao, and Li Fan had come into contact with them in his previous life as well.</p><p></p><p>After carefully comprehending them and making sure there were no problems, he finally put his mind at ease.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan appeared to be at ease during the transaction just now, in fact, when Senior Sister Zhao's voice resounded in his mind, scenes of intimacy with her in the illusion involuntarily surfaced.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Li Fan had a tenacious mind and possessed the Heart Refining Secret Technique. He promptly suppressed these fantasies, thus avoiding any slip-ups.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he turned the tables by inadvertently revealing that he seemed to be very familiar with the "Wanzhong Yixin Great Dao Sect", sowing seeds of doubt.</p><p></p><p>This made Senior Sister Zhao start to become suspicious, weakening the unintentional seductive power she exuded, allowing Li Fan to finally gain the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the Eternal Celestial Venerable, even just one of his bodies required me to go all out." Li Fan couldn't help but sigh slightly.</p><p></p><p>He separated some of the Carefree Crystal and Human Dao Stardust, leaving them on Haixuan Island.</p><p></p><p>Until a month later, when the Mutual Aid Association members had completed most of the "laundering" of the supplies, Li Fan finally returned to the Lingmu Realm with Lin Ling and Tian Yang.</p><p></p><p>During this month's stay on the island, Pei Tuo, Xiang Xin and the others were also fortunate enough to catch a glimpse of Lin Ling, Tian Yang and the others.</p><p></p><p>Even without deliberately displaying their strength, the calm pressure emanating from them still made the Mutual Aid Association members' hearts tremble.</p><p></p><p>The Congyun Sea branch had just been established, and while secretly rejoicing that they were able to join the Congyun Sea Mutual Aid Association in the first batch, they also became increasingly "loyal" to the association.</p><p></p><p>Also during this month, the Five Elders Society seemed to have taken Li Fan's parting advice and comprehensively eased their offensive. The flames of war on the border gradually ceased.</p><p></p><p>However, the Five Elders Society did not remain idle because of this.</p><p></p><p>Various rumors suddenly began to appear in the various prefectures of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Although they were all some past events, they still caused unrest within the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>For example, a certain team leader of the Martial Arts Hall in Tianquan Prefecture had killed an ordinary cultivator due to personal grudges. According to the laws of the Wanxian Alliance, he should have been dismissed and investigated. But this matter...</p><p>The news gradually faded away and was forgotten by the public. However, recently, someone brought it up again, and people were shocked to discover that the leader of the martial arts hall had been living well all these years! He was only lightly punished with a small fine!</p><p></p><p>Another example is a certain official in the Youtai Prefecture's administrative hall, who neglected his duties during his tenure. This led to the occurrence of a natural disaster that could have been avoided, resulting in the tragic deaths of hundreds of cultivators. The official was dismissed at the time. Who would have thought that today, the public discovered that after just a few years, this official had changed his appearance and taken up a new position in Tianyu Prefecture. Instead of being demoted, he was promoted!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Such old cases from years ago suddenly erupted all at once!</p><p></p><p>Even the vast majority of them, Li Fan had never heard of before.</p><p></p><p>They were the dark secrets forgotten by history.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, driven by some force, they suddenly resurfaced!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Immortal Alliance were naturally furious.</p><p></p><p>Although no disharmonious incidents had occurred yet, rebellious remarks such as "The Immortal Alliance is corrupt and not worthy of our lives" and "You enjoy the benefits while we die? It's better to perish together!" had begun to spread secretly in various places.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance attached great importance to this situation and ordered strict investigations in each prefecture.</p><p></p><p>But how easy is it to silence the masses?</p><p></p><p>The situation not only did not improve but showed a tendency to intensify.</p><p></p><p>The previously foolproof tactic of "delaying" seemed to have suddenly lost its effectiveness.</p><p></p><p>Seven days, fifteen days, a month...</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the impact of the previous negative news had not dissipated. New dark events from the past were exposed in various places.</p><p></p><p>This instantly left the Immortal Alliance in a somewhat frantic state.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect the Five Elders to have this move."</p><p></p><p>"But they are all invaluable things!"</p><p></p><p>"Frequent forgetting can indeed continuously suppress negative emotions. But conversely, if these forgotten memories erupt and surge together in a short period due to some trigger..."</p><p></p><p>"Then the destruction it brings is quite terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"No less than a million mighty soldiers!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, perhaps this is also related to the Carefree Celestial Venerable temporarily slowing down the power of oblivion enveloping the Immortal Alliance's territory."</p><p></p><p>"These are all methods I can reproduce and attack the Immortal Alliance in the future. I need to study them well."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli clicked his tongue in admiration at the surprises brought to him by the Five Elders.</p><p></p><p>A month and a half after the incident broke out, the Immortal Alliance finally made a move to respond.</p><p></p><p>The response was equally unexpected to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>But after pondering it slightly, he couldn't help but applaud.</p><p></p><p>"This move is brilliant!"</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Alliance has capable people within!"</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance's move was very simple.</p><p></p><p>There was no coercion of cultivators or prohibition of discussing related topics.</p><p></p><p>Just a simple piece of news, proclaimed to the world.</p><p></p><p>The next Immortal Alliance recruitment exam would be held six months in advance.</p><p></p><p>To counter the Five Elders' fierce offensive, the enrollment quota this time would increase by fifty percent compared to previous years.</p><p></p><p>The news shook the world!</p><p></p><p>Everyone hates privilege, yet everyone wants to become privileged!</p><p></p><p>The spreading dark secrets were a cry against injustice.</p><p></p><p>But they were also excellent promotional materials.</p><p></p><p>Do you want to be a victim in the events or one of the privileged?</p><p></p><p>If you're tempted, then come and take the exam!</p><p></p><p>With the enrollment quota increased by nearly half, the opportunities were also rising.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Immortal Alliance were all eager to try.</p>

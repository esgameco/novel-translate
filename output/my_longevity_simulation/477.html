        <h1>Chapter 477</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"And the fate of Han Yi, who was difficult to escape the soul search, was able to escape death because of this."</p><p></p><p>"Those who go with the flow have everything go smoothly; those who go against the flow will face difficulties."</p><p></p><p>"So this is the power of destiny..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan finally understood a bit, experiencing the pain of Song Yang in the Meteor Immortal Realm who wanted to seek the fate of the mysterious bird from Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a moment while staring at the rapidly rotating vortex in the ruins, Li Fan ultimately did not chase after it.</p><p></p><p>A premonition in his heart told him that if he forcefully pursued it, there would be no good outcome.</p><p></p><p>To make the present Li Fan feel a sense of crisis, the deep vortex was definitely not like the mortal small worlds such as Lijie and Daxuan without extraordinary powers.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, can't escape fate."</p><p></p><p>The aimless killing intent had locked onto Han Yi, but temporarily lost its connection to him.</p><p></p><p>Once he returned to the Xuanhuang World, Li Fan would know immediately.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the surface of the sea, the four Yuan Infant cultivators had already been completely wiped out under the Five Elements Annihilation Sword, not a single hair left.</p><p></p><p>After capturing the scene in the sky with a memory stone, Li Fan calmly returned to the Wuxian Island.</p><p></p><p>The spectacular phenomenon of the simultaneous fall of four Yuan Infant cultivators had attracted a lot of attention, even though the sea area was very remote.</p><p></p><p>After seeing the contents of the scene clearly, they couldn't help but be shocked. </p><p></p><p>Four Yuan Infant true immortals fell all at once!</p><p></p><p>What shocked them even more was that the culprit was the same person.</p><p></p><p>And it was Li Fan, a well-known divination master from the Congyun Sea, an ancient Tianji sect cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Thus, more questions arose in their minds.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't Li Fan supposed to have fallen to the Golden Core stage due to slumbering for thousands of years?</p><p></p><p>How could he still single-handedly kill four Yuan Infant cultivators?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't he skilled in divination? How could his combat power be so astonishing?</p><p></p><p>They had never heard of these four Yuan Infant cultivators, who were they?</p><p></p><p>What enmity did they have with Master Li to provoke him to commit such a ruthless act?</p><p></p><p>Doubts arose, and they relayed this explosive news to their friends and family one by one.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the news of Li Fan's killing of the four Yuan Infants quickly spread throughout the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>Inside the martial arts hall of Wuxian Island.</p><p></p><p>"Are you here to collect your reward?" The attendant responsible for reception looked at Li Fan, feeling somewhat puzzled. "What reward are you here to collect?"</p><p></p><p>"I remember, there should be corresponding rewards for successfully killing the spies of the Five Elders Meeting, right?" Li Fan asked patiently as he took out the memory stone and played back the recorded scene.</p><p></p><p>"I have killed four Yuan Infant cultivators of the Five Elders Meeting." Li Fan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>*Cough cough cough...* The martial arts hall cultivator suddenly started coughing violently. </p><p></p><p>He grabbed the memory stone, watching it repeatedly in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he looked at Li Fan with a shocked expression, "You... please wait a moment!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he stumbled and ran towards the depths of the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?" There was a murmur of excitement in the hall.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, Li Fan was respectfully invited to the guest hall of the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sat down nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a group of cultivators flooded into the hall.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, we have confirmed that the images in the memory stone are indeed real." A Yuan Infant cultivator in a yellow tight-fitting martial attire, with a hint of bloodiness still remaining on his body, stood in front of Li Fan, somewhat respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"May I be so bold to ask, have you already restored your cultivation to its former level?" He looked at Li Fan expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took a sip of the spirit tea on the table, savored it delicately, and after putting down the teacup, he casually shook his head, "Fully restored cultivation? Nonsense! Am I not still in the late stage of the Golden Core now? Isn't it obvious, can't you see it?"</p><p></p><p>The air in the guest hall suddenly quieted down.</p><p></p><p>"This..." The martial attire cultivator was dumbfounded by his words.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he somewhat angrily asked, "Then how did you kill those four Yuan Infant cultivators of the Elders Meeting?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slammed the table, startling everyone in the room. Looking disdainfully at everyone, he said, "In this day and age, do you have to personally handle killing people?"</p><p></p><p>[Sources say, currently the best app for audiobooks, install the latest version.]</p><p></p><p>"In ancient times, each sect minded its own business, cherished its own treasures, and set prices for profit. High-grade magical treasures, talismans, and other items have always been scarce and expensive."</p><p></p><p>"But now, the Xian Alliance controls half of the Xuanhuang World, and there is the coordination of legendary items like the Tianxuan Mirror, and there is no more hoarding and price gouging by unscrupulous merchants."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head and said, "I've just awakened, so I naturally have to think more about my own life. Buying some things for emergencies is quite normal, right?"</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's explanation, the martial attire cultivator finally understood, looking at him with wide eyes, "Are you saying that you killed those four Yuan Infant cultivators solely relying on external objects?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan raised his eyebrows, "What? Don't believe me?"</p><p></p><p>With that, he took out several Split Air Golden Thunder from his storage ring and placed them on the table.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts hall became somewhat chaotic.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan didn't stop there.</p><p></p><p>The Furious Fire Sky Array, Eight Desolate Annihilation Divine Thunder, Soul Sealing Divine Needle, Demon Sealing Banner...</p><p></p><p>One after another, expensive killing tools were taken out by Li Fan and piled up in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts hall fell into a dead silence.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators looked at the small mountain of disposable weapons on the table, their faces turning pale.</p><p></p><p>"Is this enough?"</p><p></p><p>"If not, it's okay. I have even more powerful stuff here." Li Fan asked somewhat nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>The martial attire cultivator wiped the cold sweat off his forehead and said repeatedly, "Enough! Enough! Master Li, could you please put away these things first! If they accidentally go off here, that would be a big problem!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded satisfactorily at his words and waved to retrieve his arsenal.</p><p></p><p>The relieved cultivators in the hall let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Although these killing tools were all cut-rate products sold by the Tianxuan Mirror and had had their powers diminished, they were still high-quality items in large quantities.</p><p></p><p>If these things were used, even the Nascent Soul cultivators would probably not be able to resist them!</p><p></p><p>"It is said that this person relies on divination, able to easily harvest and accumulate wealth. It seems to be true now."</p><p></p><p>"Money is really good. This pile of things is worth half a year's budget for our squad."</p><p></p><p>"I heard you can invest through He Zhenghao to work with him? Seems worth considering."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>For a while, the people in the martial arts hall had various expressions and thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Since there is no problem, let's talk about my reward!"</p><p></p><p>"To deal with those Elders Meeting spies, I spent a lot of money. I can't be at a loss, right?"</p>

            <p>Chapter 1155: Burying the Old and Starting a New Journey</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's clone clearly saw that the arms torn to shreds by Yin Shangren's teeth had no blood flowing out at all.</p><p></p><p>Instead, there was only some black pus.</p><p></p><p>In the pus, faces like tiny tentacles in agony let out sharp, piercing wails. However, Yin Shangren turned a blind eye to them and swallowed them directly.</p><p></p><p>Splash...</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's skin seemed to be cut open by a sharp knife, and the tentacles he had swallowed into his stomach drilled out of his body again.</p><p></p><p>Only this time, all the faces had turned into the appearance of Yin Shangren!</p><p></p><p>Li Ping hid in the corner of this altered space, quietly watching the changes in the field.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, it looked like Yin Shangren's mad act of cannibalism.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was the fusion and collision of different remnant world laws.</p><p></p><p>However, unlike the fusion process of laws in the Chizha Abyss, the abyss was carefully selected parts intended to be integrated into the Xuanhuang World.</p><p></p><p>And here...</p><p></p><p>Chaos, disorder, destruction.</p><p></p><p>It was like being thrown into a garbage dump, desperately fighting each other for a glimmer of survival.</p><p></p><p>The struggle of the world's wraiths did not last long.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because this world was not in the original Xuanhuang World, or perhaps it was because of the blessing of the Daqi Holy Dynasty's fortune, which caused the descended wraiths to be much weaker than Yin Shangren's strength.</p><p></p><p>After all the arms on the ground were swallowed into his stomach.</p><p></p><p>The wounds on his split body surface also slowly began to heal.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't enjoyed such a delicacy for a long time, I really miss it a bit." </p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's voice was no longer the previous strange double voice, but returned to a normal human voice.</p><p></p><p>However, the aura he unintentionally emitted made Li Ping, who already had the combat power of a perfected Huashen, feel chills down his spine and secretly shudder.</p><p></p><p>But Yin Shangren had no hostility. After resolving the hidden danger of the wraiths, he directly began to cultivate [Building Foundation with Me].</p><p></p><p>Li Ping narrowed his eyes. From his perspective, the law fluctuations around Yin Shangren were rapidly declining.</p><p></p><p>Not disappearing inexplicably, but slowly being absorbed into Yin Shangren's body.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's figure, like a cloud of smoke, was changing unpredictably. The faces he had originally absorbed appeared on the surface of his skin again.</p><p></p><p>Horror kept wandering, struggling to break out of the body.</p><p></p><p>It looked like Yin Shangren's body had hundreds of tumors that could burst open at any time, looking hideous and terrifying.</p><p></p><p>But Yin Shangren was incredibly determined.</p><p></p><p>Sitting quietly, without the slightest panic.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, those faces seemed to be pulled by some force and returned inside the body.</p><p></p><p>When Li Ping sensed that the overflowing aura of laws had completely disappeared, Yin Shangren suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were different from the previous madness and obsession, now like a deep pool, clear and calm.</p><p></p><p>"Building foundation with me." He looked at his hands, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"How does it feel?" Li Ping asked.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren did not answer, but directly pointed at Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Nine golden dragons suddenly appeared, roaring and guarding beside Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Under Li Ping's feet, a mud pond appeared out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's entire body was being silently devoured by the mud pond.</p><p></p><p>And in Li Ping's perception, the overall fortune of the Daqi Holy Dynasty seemed to have a small hole poked in it at this moment, constantly leaking.</p><p></p><p>Although the speed of the fortune leakage was...</p><p></p><p>The speed was slow, but there was no way to block it for a while.</p><p></p><p>The golden dragon circled, releasing a protective glow, shielding Li Ping above the mud pit.</p><p></p><p>He didn't fight back, but clicked his tongue in praise, "Sir, you have great skills."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren waved his hand, and the mud pit under Li Ping's feet disappeared in an instant: "This is the most vicious curse and resentment of the world when it's on the verge of death."</p><p></p><p>"In the past, if I wanted to transform into a curse, I would have to suffer a considerable impact myself. At the very least, I would become mentally unclear for more than half a year. But now..."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren placed his fingers in front of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>At his fingertips, the mud pit suddenly reappeared.</p><p></p><p>It was just tightly bound, swimming within the range of his index finger.</p><p></p><p>"Everything in the body is the foundation of cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"At will, with a single thought, it can be achieved." Yin Shangren murmured.</p><p></p><p>Next, Yin Shangren explained in detail to Li Ping his feelings after building his foundation with me, and his understanding of the path of the "New New Law".</p><p></p><p>"The New Law of the Dharma Heavenly Venerable is actually putting a shackle on everyone in the world on the basis of the original cultivation system. As long as you cultivate, this shackle becomes a part of you. And all the barriers on the cultivation path ahead have been dug out with specific-shaped holes."</p><p></p><p>"Only by wearing shackles and following a specific shape can you pass through them."</p><p></p><p>As Yin Shangren spoke, characters appeared out of thin air in front of him. They gathered and recorded spontaneously.</p><p></p><p>"No matter what difficulties lie ahead, you can adapt and change with your own body..."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren described it in great detail, and Li Ping listened very carefully.</p><p></p><p>"For example, if you also want to cultivate [Building Foundation with Me], then I'm afraid you will have to refine and absorb this entire dynasty into your body..." He suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping pondered for a moment and had a realization: "If that's the case, I'm afraid my Heavenly Emperor's Qi Scriptures and the hundreds of millions of subjects of the Great Enlightenment will all stay in the moment I absorb them."</p><p></p><p>"Building foundation with me, burying all my past and achieving an infinite future path..."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren clapped his hands in praise and said, "That's right!"</p><p></p><p>The characters in front of him finally took shape, forming a thin booklet. Yin Shangren took this booklet of insights in his hand, looking very pleased.</p><p></p><p>Even though they were his own summarized insights, and he couldn't be more familiar with them, Yin Shangren still flipped through it several times with great joy.</p><p></p><p>But looking at the blank pages that followed, his face showed a difficult expression.</p><p></p><p>"Primordial Golden Elixir. What is primordial?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Wanxian Alliance, Alliance Headquarters.</p><p></p><p>Since Yan Huan left, no other outsider had come to the Dharma Space.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, the impact of the last evil curse attack had not passed, and Yan Huan's last visit was just a special case.</p><p></p><p>Five hundred years of guarding time was not easy to pass.</p><p></p><p>So the two guarding elders, Zhang Xu and Hua Yueye, both had their own ultimate skills to pass the time.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xu deduced a mortal world in his consciousness sea.</p><p></p><p>Then he sealed off a wisp of his consciousness and invested it into it. To go through reincarnation and experience all kinds of wonderful lives.</p><p></p><p>As for Hua Yueye, he split into another self.</p><p></p><p>The "two" sat and discussed, exchanging ideas with each other.</p><p></p><p>No one understands oneself better than oneself, so they were in harmony and very happy.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Fan, he didn't play as fancy as them.</p><p></p><p>While studying the latest formation deduction results of the End Separation Disk, he supervised the experiences around the Holy Fetus and his avatar.</p>

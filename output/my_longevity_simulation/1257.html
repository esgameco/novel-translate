        <h1>Chapter 1257</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's words were not empty promises.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether it was the Great Master of the Heavenly Capital or the existence secretly monitoring Xuanhuang, they certainly would not transcend the realm of [Immortals].</p><p></p><p>Although Li Ping was currently only at the Longevity Realm of the Xuanhuang World, as the incarnation of the Heavenly Dao on this land where too many strange things had happened, he grasped the means to achieve mutual destruction and restraint.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping needed some time to sort out the gains he obtained from the stone tablet and the Crossing Calamity Sect.</p><p></p><p>He put away the Crossing Calamity Book and stored it in the treasure vault for suppression; he gave the stone tablet a rare leisure time to relax and disguise itself as a mortal to travel in the Xuanhuang World.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping himself first arrived in the Xuanhuang World.</p><p></p><p>Fuguang State, Great Rift Valley.</p><p></p><p>Deep underground.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the superficial protective formations around, Li Ping arrived at the depths of the relic ruins.</p><p></p><p>Here, he felt two extremely terrifying forces that even made him feel a little uneasy.</p><p></p><p>One came from the two statues or two remains in the ruins.</p><p></p><p>The other came from this [First Sect] ruin itself.</p><p></p><p>"The worrisome hidden dangers can all find solutions here."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping stared at the ruins that had been desolate for a long time but seemed to have just been destroyed, and thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Without using the power of the golden origin force essence, he silently chanted in his heart: "Cat Treasure."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Cat Treasure was in the treasure vault under the Holy Emperor's seat, using its paws to tease the trembling Crossing Calamity Book. After sensing Li Ping's summons, the figure pressing on the Crossing Calamity Book did not disappear, but another small cat body appeared on Li Ping's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Meow~"</p><p></p><p>Cat Treasure called out in response.</p><p></p><p>"Take everything here away." Li Ping patted its head.</p><p></p><p>Cat Treasure glanced at the [First Sect] ruins, a trace of disdain flashing in its eyes. However, it did not disobey Li Ping's order.</p><p></p><p>Its figure instantly became ethereal like data blue light, and Cat Treasure slightly opened its mouth.</p><p></p><p>The blue dots expanded, enveloping the entire underground ruins.</p><p></p><p>After Cat Treasure returned to its original form, the original location of the [First Sect] ruins, including the buildings, formations, space, and everything inside.</p><p></p><p>All disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Only pure nothingness remained.</p><p></p><p>Cat Treasure yawned and became a little listless.</p><p></p><p>The First Sect ruins were not directly destroyed but were completely stored in Cat Treasure's "belly". With a single thought from Li Ping, he could release it again.</p><p></p><p>In fact, with Li Ping's current strength alone, he could easily achieve this point with simple space cutting and transfer.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Li Ping let Cat Treasure take action was to prevent his own origin force essence from disturbing the remnants of the Eroding Wind Calamity in the ruins.</p><p></p><p>It was also to test the power nature of Cat Treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Not only are the remains of the Great Master of the Heavenly Capital unaffected, but even the Eroding Wind Calamity, which is extremely sensitive to the power of [Immortals], is also unmoved."</p><p></p><p>"Although Cat Treasure is not an immortal artifact, it seems to be taking a completely different path."</p><p></p><p>The scenes of disciple Sun Erlang's experiences in the True Nation flashed before Li Ping's eyes one by one.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as the Holy Dynasty was greatly opened, and under the operation of the great faceless Holy Emperor, its strength became more and more powerful.</p><p></p><p>Far across the starry sea, the Holy Fetus Li Fan also ushered in a huge harvest.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the reverberating star power originating from the invisible high wall erupted again.</p><p></p><p>Hidden in the Remnant Wall, the Holy Fetus Li Fan could vaguely feel the slight tremor of the surrounding worlds.</p><p></p><p>The tremors of different remnant pieces merged and harmonized with each other, condensing into a strange power, resisting the vast immortal power that could easily destroy the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>Affected by the reverberating star power, although the Holy Fetus Li Fan's body was involuntarily attracted towards the high wall, there was no bewilderment or panic in his eyes like the first encounter.</p><p></p><p>Instead, there was immersion and the joy of enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"The reverberating star power is the remnant of true immortal power."</p><p></p><p>"And the Remnant Wall is the corpse of the mortal cultivation world. Although the cultivation world was vulnerable to the immortal power when it was alive, after its death, it can unite to resist it together."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan's eyes became brighter and brighter: "This is the Dao of the entire Dark Star Sea, evolving spontaneously."</p><p></p><p>"It is no longer the existence called the lower realm when the immortal realm still existed, but a new Dao system reborn from destruction."</p><p></p><p>"The destruction of the immortal realm, regardless of the reason, indicates that the immortal realm has already gone against the most fundamental Dao of the world. And the Dark Star Sea that still exists today is instinctively and slowly transforming towards this most fundamental Dao."</p><p></p><p>"As one rises, the other falls. This is also the reason why the Remnant Wall can actually resist the power of the true immortal seal characters. The Dark Star Sea is still far from completing this sublimation, but if given enough time..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the Dark Star Sea within this high wall can develop into an existence comparable to the former immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan had a realization, and in his perception, the overall rhythm of the Remnant Wall also became clearer and brighter, like a melodious song.</p><p></p><p>His speed of floating towards the invisible high wall also gradually slowed down.</p><p></p><p>"One day of enlightenment here is equivalent to a hundred years in the Xuanhuang World."</p><p></p><p>"In this sense, it is not wrong to call this place the [Immortal Realm]."</p><p></p><p>The body of the Holy Fetus Li Fan finally came to a complete stop, floating within the remnant pieces of various realms.</p><p></p><p>Strangely, the sword light he slashed out, after flying straight for a distance, changed its original direction.</p><p></p><p>It flew towards the nearest world remnant piece.</p><p></p><p>After locking onto the target, it accelerated. Like a silver-white spider silk, it fiercely embedded into it.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan continuously moved in the opposite direction of the high wall, stepping out of the Remnant Wall bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>What was left behind were thousands of sword light threads that slowly concealed into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>"With the Remnant Wall as an anchor, not only do I not have to worry about being attracted by the high wall again, but I can also shuttle through the starry sea at a faster speed."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan turned into an invisible light and quickly returned to the Profound Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>The divine sense he left behind was no longer sufficient to deal with the increasingly complex situation. It was time for him to make an appearance.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The avatar and the Holy Fetus both accumulated strength for future use.</p><p></p><p>And the hidden card Li Fan left at the Sun Family also ushered in the moment of hatching.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan looked at Wu Ninglu with a solemn face, instructing him on various things to pay attention to during the process of merging with the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu only subconsciously nodded, with most of his attention focused on the tightly bound Spirit of Heaven and Earth not far away.</p><p></p><p>Spirit of Heaven and Earth: White Silk.</p><p></p><p>Like light smoke, like flowing light. It had no substance, but it was extremely gorgeous, emitting a mesmerizing glow, incredibly attractive to the minds of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"This is one of the foundations of our Sun Family. It was originally meant to compensate Sun Ang. I went through great difficulties to find it. Unexpectedly, he later relied on his own opportunity to achieve the merging with the Dao..."</p><p></p><p>"Lu'er, he is about to-"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Entering the Dharma Protection Hall to take up duty, this Dao Spirit should belong to you as compensation."</p><p></p><p>"If you harmonize with the Dao, it will also greatly benefit the fetus in your belly." Although Sun Luchang said this, his expression betrayed him. </p><p></p><p>Only when Sun Luyuan coldly snorted did he reluctantly restrain himself a bit.</p><p></p><p>The Sun family was still under Sun Luyuan's command for now.</p><p></p><p>"Egret, you may proceed. We will protect the Dharma for you," Sun Luyuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu looked at the three Dao Harmonized members of the Sun family, her heart overflowing with excitement.</p><p></p><p>After lying low in the Sun family for so long, the time for harvest had finally come. </p><p></p><p>Although this harvest deviated somewhat from her original goal, but...</p><p></p><p>"Counting my husband and I, a family with five Dao Harmonized members. Even in the Myriad Immortals Alliance, we would be a top-notch powerful clan."</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu was so excited that she was almost hit by the confusing illusory light of the white silk.</p><p></p><p>"Egret, focus your mind to face it!"</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the three Dao Harmonized members of the Sun family took action in time to resolve the attack.</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu no longer dared to be negligent. She collected her mind and seriously dealt with the Dao Spirit before her.</p><p></p><p>Although the white silk's attacks were not very powerful, its confusing illusory light was quite troublesome. </p><p></p><p>Not only would it cause damage to physical entities, it would also erode the mind of the cultivator hit.</p><p></p><p>Even if one dodged all the attacks of the illusory light, after a prolonged entanglement, surrounded by the white light, it was hard to avoid falling into successive illusions.</p><p></p><p>But after all, the three Dao Harmonized members of the Sun family had prepared for a long time. Lighting an incense stick dispelled all the illusions before Wu Ninglu's eyes.</p><p></p><p>There were also special magic treasures used to restrain the white silk's illusory light.</p><p></p><p>Even though there was a huge gap between Wu Ninglu's strength and its, it was still slowly worn down to death.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Dao Spirit on the verge of death and her own Dao Harmonization within reach, Wu Ninglu couldn't help but feel ecstatic.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder there are so many young Dao Harmonized cultivators in the Myriad Immortals Alliance! With such treatment, even a pig's head could achieve Dao Harmonization, right?"</p><p></p><p>"To think I really believed they were some unrivaled geniuses before..."</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Wu Ninglu's blade finally pierced through the body of the Dao Spirit White Silk.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Fierce light erupted from its body. Wu Ninglu only felt an extremely powerful force continuously transferring into her own body.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the feeling of Dao Harmonization."</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu's eyes were full of obsession, unable to extricate herself.</p><p></p><p>Just as she was immersed in this unprecedented powerful force, she didn't even notice that the fetus in her belly was sharing this power.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's spiritual sense, attached to the fetus, was not satisfied with the quality of the Dao Spirit White Silk.</p><p></p><p>"Still too weak. Not to mention compared to Ink Slaughter, it's not even as good as Scarlet Flame."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's spiritual sense watched the Dao Spirit's power continuously pouring into the fetus, and also separated a part of itself to merge into it.</p><p></p><p>This wisp of spiritual sense was already split off and negligible to begin with.</p><p></p><p>But that was for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>For the unborn fetus, it was a great nourishment. Especially since this wisp of Li Fan's spiritual sense contained countless insights into the principles of the Primordial World.</p><p></p><p>Mixed into the Dao Spirit White Silk's essence, it was devoured by the fetus.</p><p></p><p>The most direct change caused by this was that the instantly strengthened fetus began competing with the mother for resources.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Wu Ninglu was no fool and eventually discovered the abnormality in her body.</p><p></p><p>Although she was a mother, when it came to the fruit of Dao Harmonization, how could she give it up?!</p><p></p><p>So Wu Ninglu instinctively fought with the fetus over the ownership of the Dao Spirit's essence.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu soon discovered to her horror that she actually couldn't win against this wicked spawn!</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, if this continues..." Wu Ninglu's face changed. After only a moment's hesitation, she had already made a decision in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Just as she was about to take drastic action and end the life of the fetus in her belly...</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing!" Sun Luyuan's furious shout interrupted her action.</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu then found to her surprise that her body instantly lost control.</p><p></p><p>After all, she had not yet achieved Dao Harmonization, so how could she be a match for the three Dao Harmonized members of the Sun family?!</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu couldn't speak, and could only beg Sun Luyuan for help with her expression.</p><p></p><p>But Sun Luyuan, as well as Sun Luchang and Sun Lujiu, didn't care about her life or death at all.</p><p></p><p>They only stared at the fetus in her belly with burning eyes.</p><p></p><p>The three ignored Wu Ninglu and discussed:</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, have you ever heard of such an anomaly?"</p><p></p><p>"Using a prenatal body to seize the fortune of heaven and earth. This child's future achievements will be limitless!"</p><p></p><p>"If possible, he might even be born Dao Harmonized?"</p><p></p><p>"It's worth a try. Even if not, being born at the Nascent Soul stage is a sure thing."</p><p></p><p>The three members of the Sun family had shining eyes.</p><p></p><p>Hearing their conversation, Wu Ninglu's heart turned ice-cold.</p><p></p><p>But at this point, she had no room for regret.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the power continuously draining away, yet concentrating in her abdomen...</p><p></p><p>In this extremely contradictory situation, Wu Ninglu's consciousness gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Dao Spirit White Silk perished.</p><p></p><p>The mother Wu Ninglu died, her Dao extinguished.</p><p></p><p>In the scene, there was only a fetus, born from the mother's body.</p><p></p><p>Not crying or making a fuss, one hand pointing to the sky, one hand pointing to the earth.</p><p></p><p>Quietly looking at the three Dao Harmonized members of the Sun family.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan and the others were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"This little baby doesn't seem to have a name yet?"</p><p></p><p>"Well, I was originally planning to ask Lu'er the next time we visited him."</p><p></p><p>"No need to ask him! Although he is undoubtedly his son, he is even more so a descendant of our Sun family. As elders, can't we make the decision?"</p><p></p><p>"I think he should be called Sun Wei. Born Dao Harmonized, he will surely raise the might of our Sun family."</p><p></p><p>"How vulgar! How vulgar! I think he should be called..."</p><p></p><p>The few people didn't feel any pity for Wu Ninglu's passing at all.</p><p></p><p>They only surrounded the Sun family's prodigy child, immeasurably happy.</p><p></p><p>That newly born infant, however, looked at his mother's corpse, a trace of sorrow flashing through his eyes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In an extremely dark space.</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>"Am I dead?"</p><p></p><p>"Where is this place?"</p><p></p><p>A consciousness, after an incomparably long slumber, finally awakened again.</p><p></p><p>First there was a moment of confusion, then all kinds of memories from when it was alive quickly surfaced in its mind.</p><p></p><p>Soaring resentment welled up.</p><p></p><p>"The Sun family!"</p><p></p><p>"And that damn mongrel!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill kill kill kill kill..."</p><p></p><p>There was no room for anything else in its mind, only the desire for revenge.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to take revenge on them?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded by Wu Ninglu's ear.</p><p></p><p>"Who?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu instantly woke up and looked around with extreme resentment.</p>

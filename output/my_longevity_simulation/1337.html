        <h1>Chapter 1337</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1326: The Darkest Sea Basin</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, they are all safe and each has had their own experience. ‚ô™üê†‚ùª‚ûà·îïùìóùìæ–ñ.cùï†Áà™üèÜüòæ"</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan said this, Baixua's expression suddenly became somewhat subtle. </p><p></p><p>To Li Fan, the edge of the Starry Sea, the Remnant Wall, and the high walls were almost all unfamiliar areas.</p><p></p><p>The principle of the Ends of the Earth Formation was different from ordinary teleportation formations, but the effect was essentially the same. Baixua habitually called it a teleportation formation, and Li Fan did not correct her.</p><p></p><p>Having these great figures who had survived since the ancient calamity explore the path was Li Fan's plan to begin with. This sudden eruption of the rebounding starry force had only accelerated this process.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan decided not to worry about them for now. He would ask them in detail when they returned.</p><p></p><p>"The mark should have been left by Xu Kexin, but I searched around it and couldn't find any trace of him. The remnant true immortal power was becoming increasingly violent, and I could no longer withstand it, so I had no choice but to pass through the teleportation formation and return," Baixua said, still somewhat shaken.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, as if seeing the magnificent scene below the high walls again.</p><p></p><p>"According to the normal course, these true immortal powers should slowly return to the Dark Starry Sea. But for some unknown reason, the Remnant Wall formed continuously below the high walls, firmly blocking these true immortal powers."</p><p></p><p>"This caused them to form a peculiar stable state. Now, this stability has been broken."</p><p></p><p>"The true immortal power is pouring down like a raging flood, slowly flowing into the lowest part of the Dark Starry Sea, raising the entire sea..."</p><p></p><p>A glimmer of enlightenment flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, the rapid recovery of the Starry Sea may have been driven by this event.</p><p></p><p>"What I need to do now is to find a way to intercept and temporarily preserve this flood."</p><p></p><p>"In the hope of using it when the Xuanhuang Realm ascends in the future."</p><p></p><p>This was undoubtedly a huge project. </p><p></p><p>It was impossible to do it perfectly in just half a month. Li Fan could only do his best.</p><p></p><p>The position of the Xuanhuang Realm was very special - outside the Immortal Ruins. Due to the existence of enlightened true immortals within the Immortal Ruins, from the overall height distribution of the Dark Starry Sea, the Xuanhuang Realm was absolutely at the highest peak.</p><p></p><p>In fact, because it was so close, the Xuanhuang Realm itself was slightly elevated relative to its surroundings, like the raised earth around an emerging mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, it's as if there is an invisible barrier, so the impact the Xuanhuang Realm naturally faces will be much less."</p><p></p><p>"What I need to do is create a basin, and then guide and accumulate the true immortal power from a wide area as much as possible."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>He had personally experienced the journey of ascension. To ascend and approach immortality, one only needed to continuously stimulate one's energy and elevate one's realm.</p><p></p><p>But as for how to create a basin...</p><p>Li Fan was still completely ignorant for now.</p><p></p><p>However, when he had overlooked the Dark Starry Sea from the Remnant Wall and the main control core, he had indeed seen areas that were lower than the ordinary regions within the sea.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan swiftly went to Oushan Tian and generated some true immortal flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Oushan Tian's face already pale as paper, Li Fan frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems finding true immortal remains has become urgent."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan temporarily suppressed this thought, condensing his source power into a protective golden armor. The illusory wooden sword unsheathed, and in an instant he had left the Xuanhuang Realm, flying rapidly through the Dark Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>As he sped towards the target area from his memory, he comprehended the changes in the differences of height.</p><p></p><p>After the wooden sword left one area of the starry sea, Li Fan seemed to sense something.</p><p></p><p>He returned again, hovering in the void, carefully observing.</p><p></p><p>"This is indeed a natural basin."</p><p></p><p>"But if I hadn't witnessed the heights and lows and viewed it from a higher dimensional perspective, I probably wouldn't have been able to discover the special nature of this place."</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't seem any different from the other areas of the starry sea."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned and sent out strand after strand of divine thoughts to explore various parts of the area.</p><p></p><p>The result was the same as his perception.</p><p></p><p>This basin seemed to show no difference from normal areas despite its lower position.</p><p></p><p>After standing there for a long while still at a loss, Li Fan suddenly realized something.</p><p></p><p>Controlling his physical and spiritual power, he flicked his finger and released a sword energy strike.</p><p></p><p>It was just simulating the level of a spirit formation cultivator, but as the sword energy whistled through, it tore a crack in the space along its path.</p><p></p><p>Although the crack quickly closed up, Li Fan had seen it.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>"This basin has become fragile," Li Fan realized.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't just the space itself.</p><p></p><p>All the conditions maintaining the existence of this space had greatly diminished compared to normal starry sea areas.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Realm is to this place as the Immortal Realm is to the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm would be like true immortals in this area. They could destroy the world with a glance, without even needing to exert effort."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sensed the fragility of this basin.</p><p></p><p>"Its height compared to the Xuanhuang Realm doesn't actually differ that much. But the manifestation of the phenomenon is so obvious," Li Fan pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>"If it were even lower, to the extreme, what would happen?"</p><p></p><p>A question couldn't help but arise.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts drifted.</p><p></p><p>However, this place was already nearly the lowest part of the Dark Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>His question had no ready answer to refer to for now.</p><p></p><p>As the date of the rebounding starry force grew closer, Li Fan's thoughts returned to the present.</p><p></p><p>"With my current understanding, I still can't figure out the specific reasons for the formation of these basins."</p><p></p><p>"But it doesn't prevent me from utilizing them first."</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan had been an official in the Great Xuanhuang in the past, he had personally conducted on-site inspections, designed blueprints, and constructed water conservancy projects to benefit the region.</p><p></p><p>Now in his eyes, this project of guiding the true immortal power to converge in the basin was essentially no different from water conservancy construction.</p><p></p><p>"This basin is a natural reservoir."</p><p></p><p>"What I need to do is channel the true immortal power to flow here!"</p><p></p><p>"First, I can't let the basin absorb the true immortal power I guide here. Otherwise it will only lead to the basin rising and disappearing..."</p><p></p><p>"Source power essence is insoluble in true immortal power, yet it is an excellent material."</p><p></p><p>A ray of brilliance flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Then an endless, cloth-like stream of source power essence erupted from his body.</p><p></p><p>Just a thin layer, to separate and isolate.</p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's control, it quickly covered the entire basin.</p><p></p><p>Golden light radiated out as the source power essence dissipated into the darkness, seeming no different from before.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan knew that relative to before, there was now an invisible barrier separating the basin from the outside.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Compared to before, this place has undergone a qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>"At the same time, continuously reinforce the isolation layer at the bottom of the depression."</p><p></p><p>"The essence of primal force is running a bit low, so the Youzu people will have to suffer temporarily." </p><p></p><p>With a thought from Li Fan, all the Youzu people being raised in the small world of Daxuan felt something. </p><p></p><p>They woke up in droves from their slumber.</p><p></p><p>Then kneeling down, they devoutly prayed without eating or drinking.</p><p></p><p>The essence of primal force slowly became replenished again. Li Fan then viewed this area from an elevated dimensional perspective.</p><p></p><p>The irregular boundary did not cover a large area. </p><p></p><p>If it was at the current scale, even if swept by the remnant force of a True Immortal, the amount that could be gathered would be extremely limited.</p><p></p><p>"How should I divert the flow?"</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation, Li Fan suddenly had an idea.</p><p></p><p>The illusory sword shadow flickered continuously. </p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, Li Fan set up arrays for dimensional ascension over a vast area of space around the depression.</p><p></p><p>Since True Immortal flesh was consumed too quickly, Li Fan had to return to the Xuanhuang realm again.</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtan was already on the verge of death, and even the Kunqun bone in his hand showed faint cracks. It seemed it could no longer generate True Immortal flesh in the short term.</p><p></p><p>However, he managed to gather enough materials.  </p><p></p><p>The arrays were set up according to plan.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the imminent rebounding starforce, Li Fan silently waited.</p><p></p><p>"Currently, I haven't found a way to anchor the state after ascension."</p><p></p><p>"But I can trigger short-term eruptions, forming peaks that alter the flow of True Immortal force."</p><p></p><p>"According to my precise calculations, the True Immortal force across this vast expanse of space will all be diverted here by me."</p><p></p><p>Hum......</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan expected, the rebounding starforce, like a raging tide or terrifying storm, arrived on schedule.  </p><p></p><p>With a determined gaze, Li Fan successively activated the ascension arrays one by one.</p><p></p><p>In the dark sea of stars not far from the Xuanhuang realm, an extraordinary scene appeared in the surrounding space.</p><p></p><p>Only supreme experts who had ascended could perhaps view it from above.</p><p></p><p>A series of short mountains suddenly rose up,</p><p></p><p>Blocking the surging tide of True Immortal force.</p><p></p><p>Although these mountains soon collapsed after rising briefly,</p><p></p><p>They did truly collide with the tide of True Immortal force.</p><p></p><p>The short peaks crumbled amidst the thunderous impacts.</p><p></p><p>But the tide of True Immortal force also changed direction after repeated collisions,</p><p></p><p>Rushing towards the depression delineated by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh......</p><p></p><p>At first it was just a light breeze.</p><p></p><p>But as more and more True Immortal force was diverted, the howling force here became even stronger than the initial eruption point below the high wall.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had to take refuge in the illusory sword shadow, relying on the profundities of reality and illusion to evade the True Immortal force's influence.</p><p></p><p>Watching this depression slowly fill up,</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan's stalwart heart couldn't help feeling a sense of pride.</p><p></p><p>"What a True Immortal can do, I can now do as well!"</p><p></p><p>"Although troublesome, as long as I grasp the specific method, I can replicate it countless times in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Just like continuing below the high wall, obstructed by the Remnant Realm's long wall.</p><p></p><p>The vast amounts of True Immortal force accumulated in the depression.</p><p></p><p>Due to the isolation of the primal force essence and this place's innate special properties,</p><p></p><p>It did not cause the space's own power to rise, only endlessly accumulating strength.</p><p></p><p>Like another Immortal Remnant appearing before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The illusory sword shadow flickered, as if directly facing a True Immortal's remnant.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned and maneuvered the illusion, leaving the depression's area.</p><p></p><p>As if they were not in the same world.</p><p></p><p>The tide of True Immortal force was still converging.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, when the depression was completely filled, the overflowing tide only then continued sweeping across other regions of the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>However, with such a large reservoir, the storm's might had already been greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>Especially since this reservoir was blocking the path to the Xuanhuang realm, so the living beings there hardly felt any disturbance from it.</p><p></p><p>In this era, the members of the Wanxian Alliance who also received the Dharma Patriarch's warning looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>"The upheaval the Patriarch spoke of probably hasn't arrived yet?"</p><p></p><p>"That was definitely just the prelude, the big one is still to come!"</p><p></p><p>"What a pity if such vast force is simply wasted."</p><p></p><p>Having witnessed the scenes of the dark sea of stars from a high vantage point, and personally seen small worlds ascend and fall, shattering into pieces, Li Fan gained new insights into the True Immortal remnant force accumulated below the high wall and blocked by the Remnant Realm's long wall.</p><p></p><p>"The True Immortal force emanating from the True Immortals of the Immortal Remnants who comprehended the 'Hunger' aphorism, in the process of expanding outwards, encountered the obstruction of the high wall. Over time, it continuously gathered at the foot of the high wall. The accumulation of the True Immortal force's power formed a relative high ground."</p><p></p><p>"However, under the sweeping of the True Immortal remnant force, the teleportation formation needs maintenance every so often. Otherwise, if damaged, we'd have to make the trip again, introducing many more variables. This matter is left to you."</p><p></p><p>Along with the primal force essence came information related to maintaining the Tianya Xili grand formation.</p><p></p><p>Baixiang nodded in understanding and quickly immersed herself in studying this profound formation knowledge. Although it only covered the basic component structures of the grand formation and did not involve the core, it still left Baixiang entranced.</p><p></p><p>After making arrangements for Baixiang, Li Fan gazed into the dark sea of stars.</p><p></p><p>"The impact of the rebounding starforce will likely reach near the Xuanhuang realm in about half a month's time. Just like the previous era, the entire world will be plunged into violent tremors."</p><p></p><p>Not caring about Baixiang's thoughts, Li Fan handed over another cluster of primal force essence. "For now, don't go to the teleportation formation. Wait until the storm passes."</p><p></p><p>He understood the natures of these few people very well. No major issues would arise.</p><p></p><p>"Since it's simply an accumulation of force, it cannot maintain stability."</p><p></p><p>"On one hand, it will collapse downwards. On the other hand..."</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong's predicament was even better than Xuke's. Xuke's aura flickered unsteadily, clearly struggling to survive amidst the remnant waves of True Immortal force. Yet Qiaogong's side was very stable, as if completely unaffected by the turbulent starforce.</p><p></p><p>As for Yin Shangren...</p><p></p><p>He began tracing the marks he had left on them, sensing their current locations and conditions.</p><p></p><p>Xuke and Qiaogong were indeed still alive.</p><p></p><p>But the mark left on Yin had completely vanished.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, something is amiss. Not to mention his current strength being unable to detect my methods, even if he vaguely sensed it, based on my previous performance and actions, he should have taken it as my blessing and not actively removed it."</p>

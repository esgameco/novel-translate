        <div class="content">
            <p>Since Li Fan noticed the existence of the sounds, they seemed to have found a target to spread to.</p><p></p><p>They swarmed in one after another, entangling around Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it was as if he had fallen into a hell where evil spirits gathered. Li Fan only felt that he was surrounded by these horrifying sounds from all directions. </p><p></p><p>And he wasn't sure if it was an illusion.</p><p></p><p>From these inexplicable whispering sounds, Li Fan seemed to always hear the two words "Tian" and "Yi".</p><p></p><p>And the more he thought so, the louder the sounds of the two words "Tianyi" became.</p><p></p><p>Like constantly rising tides, they came in waves, wanting to completely drown Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, inside the Duchen Boat, a fiery red glow flashed.</p><p></p><p>Above the cabin, a twelve-petaled red lotus appeared gracefully.</p><p></p><p>As the red lotus petals bloomed one by one, the sounds by Li Fan's ears also suddenly cleared up.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Huangfu Song's voice come belatedly: "...meaning, it should just be a sound tide that accidentally erupted from the depths of the Chizha Abyss."</p><p></p><p>"This Duchen Boat has the Jingshi Red Lotus Formation shield, which can keep us safe and sound."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had returned to normal, nodded upon hearing this, but in his heart, he was recalling the sounds he had just heard.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Huangfu, are the sounds in the Chizha Abyss the same for everyone? Or do they vary from person to person?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>This question was very important. Li Fan stared intently at Huangfu Song, waiting for his answer.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song was a little surprised, but after pondering for a moment, he still explained: "The demonic sounds of the abyss are indescribable. After they leave the Chizha Abyss, their essence does not change. However, each cultivator's ability to withstand the demonic sounds is different, so naturally what they hear varies greatly."</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the person who has been guarding the Chizha Abyss for many years can even comprehend the profound techniques of the Great Dao from the demonic sounds."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the "Tianyi" howls he had heard from the abyssal demonic sounds earlier should have been a hallucination triggered by the psychological shadow left on him by Tianyi back then being too heavy.</p><p></p><p>"Triggering deeply hidden fears within the heart?" Just the sound tides sweeping past the outer layers of the abyss were so terrifying. It was really hard to imagine how frightening the situation at the very bottom of the abyss would be.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Wanxian Alliance attached such importance to it.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that this mission won't be so easy." Li Fan thought to himself as he looked at the alternately flashing red lotus pattern on the ceiling that was bright and dark.</p><p></p><p>While he was pondering, the Duchen Boat seemed to pass through some kind of barrier, and it shook violently.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked out the window, and the white fog was no longer as thick as when he first saw it.</p><p></p><p>"We're almost at the Eternal Immortal Fortress."</p><p></p><p>"Prepare to disembark."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Huangfu Song got up from his round seat and walked out.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Xue Mu naturally followed immediately.</p><p></p><p>When they reached the bow deck, the field of vision suddenly opened up.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings were all thick devouring element white fog, and the Duchen Boat shuttled through it quickly, seemingly unable to feel any change in the surrounding scenery.</p><p></p><p>But when Li Fan looked back at the path they had come from, he could clearly see that the density of the white fog was constantly decreasing.</p><p></p><p>From the outside to the inside, distinct circular rings were formed according to the lightness and darkness of the color.</p><p></p><p>And on the Duchen Boat, a layer of constantly flashing and jumping black light was isolating the erosion of the white fog.</p><p></p><p>The Duchen Boat flew forward at high speed. When the white fog thinned to the point where things could be seen.</p><p></p><p>A huge green stone palm suddenly appeared above Li Fan's head.</p><p></p><p>The five fingers were like towering pillars, and the lines on the palm were clearly visible.</p><p></p><p>It blocked the sky and filled Li Fan's field of vision.</p><p></p><p>The Duchen Boat was so tiny compared to it.</p><p></p><p>As if it was about to press down on his head at any time, Li Fan's heart suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Xue Mu's face turned even paler, and he subconsciously reached out his hand to block it.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song was very satisfied with Xue Mu's reaction.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he say unhurriedly: "By the way, I forgot to tell you. The severed palm ahead is the Eternal Immortal Fortress that guards the Chizha Abyss."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Xue Mu finally put his hands down with some stiff movements.</p><p></p><p>But he still looked at the giant palm overhead in shock, unable to speak.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes and carefully observed the surface of the palm.</p><p></p><p>The green stone severed palm was too huge, and the crisscrossing lines on the surface were like winding mountain ranges.</p><p></p><p>Intertwined and complex.</p><p></p><p>It didn't look man-made at all.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting..."</p><p></p><p>Finally, they flew into the torn wrist.</p><p></p><p>The strong sense of oppression disappeared, and Xue Mu let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Huangfu, why is the Eternal Immortal Fortress built in this shape? It's really scary." Xue Mu asked after recovering.</p><p></p><p>Before Huangfu Song could answer, Shangguan Shi, who was leading another group of people, interjected.</p><p></p><p>"Boy, it's not that the Eternal Immortal Fortress wants to be built in the shape of a severed palm. The entire Eternal Immortal Fortress is transformed from this severed palm."</p><p></p><p>"You've already reached your destination, yet you don't even know this common knowledge."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Huangfu, it seems your teachings are not very thorough."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Shi said with a slight sneer.</p><p></p><p>However, Huangfu Song did not get angry, and only responded with a smile: "Then I'll have to trouble you, Brother Shangguan, to re-explain it to these two boys. I'm happy to be leisurely."</p><p></p><p>"You..." A hint of anger flashed in Shangguan Shi's eyes.</p><p></p><p>But he soon thought of something and did not act up.</p><p></p><p>With a cold snort, he gave Li Fan and Xue Mu a simple introduction about the origin of this severed palm.</p><p></p><p>In the vast devouring element white fog, there were domains everywhere.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the Chizha Abyss where they were currently located, there were many other strange existences.</p><p></p><p>This severed palm was discovered by the Wanxian Alliance on the outskirts of a certain domain.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have drifted here after passing through layers of white fog.</p><p></p><p>After some research, the Wanxian Alliance discovered that this severed palm was actually the remains of a fallen powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation technique practiced by this powerhouse of unknown identity was extremely unique. After his death, his body not only did not rot, but instead became like green stone.</p><p></p><p>Extremely hard, able to treat various magical attacks as nothing.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was naturally able to resist the erosion of the devouring element white fog.</p><p></p><p>Based on the principle of making the most of everything, after decades of transformation, the Wanxian Alliance finally succeeded in building a fortress that could freely navigate in the white fog based on it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Alright, no need to be surprised. It's just a fallen ancient Celestial Venerable. No matter how strong he was in the past, now he has to be used as a tool by us."</p><p></p><p>When Xue Mu was shocked again, Ji Hongdao's voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Ancient Celestial Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>"Eternal... Celestial Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao's nonchalant words did not make Xue Mu's shock disappear, but instead made him even more horrified.</p><p></p><p>He directly exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>Not only him, the other cultivators who had rushed to the deck one after another, all those who heard about this for the first time, were also shocked one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Even Eternal Celestial Venerables can fall?"</p><p></p><p>A cultivator couldn't help but ask in a daze.</p>

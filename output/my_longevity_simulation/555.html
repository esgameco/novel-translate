        <h1>Chapter 555</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Sì, who was peeking in secret, was seething with anger.</p><p></p><p>He had never imagined that Han Yi could truly summon celestial phenomena like a deity.</p><p></p><p>Not only had the plan to besiege Han Yi failed, but even his childhood home, the beloved Zhucun village, was almost destroyed in this disaster.</p><p></p><p>Many familiar faces had turned into burnt corpses beyond recognition.</p><p></p><p>Anger, jealousy, resentment...</p><p></p><p>Various emotions flooded Sì's heart, ultimately transforming into one voice.</p><p></p><p>"Kill him! Kill him!"</p><p></p><p>In the vast night, Han Yi had completely disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>However, Sì had served as the High Priest for decades, and his means of communicating with deities were not deceptive.</p><p></p><p>Although the fluctuations on Han Yi and the god he worshipped were distinct, Sì followed the residual waves in the air all the way and finally caught up with Han Yi.</p><p></p><p>"Die! So-called deities should not even appear on Earth!"</p><p></p><p>Sì's face contorted, uttering the words that had been suppressed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>As he continued to chant, Han Yi suddenly realized that the wind in the air was incessantly converging towards Sì's hands.</p><p></p><p>Compressed to the extreme, it was instantly ejected towards Han Yi.</p><p></p><p>"So the heavenly luck can be used this way?"</p><p></p><p>Han Yi was both shocked and delighted.</p><p></p><p>Although he had received another wound, Han Yi's eyes were becoming brighter. </p><p></p><p>Dodging and sensing, Han Yi learned Sì's way of manipulating the wind blades.</p><p></p><p>Finally, on the brink of exhaustion and covered in wounds, he successfully attempted it.</p><p></p><p>The first summoning of the wind blade appeared deeper in color compared to Sì's, and its momentum was more tremendous.</p><p></p><p>Whizzing through the air, it shattered Sì's wind blades and continued its fierce path.</p><p></p><p>In the bewildered and resentful gaze of his opponent, it pierced through his body, completing the counter-kill.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi, covered in wounds, breathed a sigh of relief and fell into a deep slumber.</p><p></p><p>When he woke up, he found that his injuries had almost healed overnight.</p><p></p><p>Without finding the reason, Han Yi did not delve further.</p><p></p><p>He just continued to escape into the wilderness where nobody ventured.</p><p></p><p>But soon, he discovered that there were small squads everywhere searching for him.</p><p></p><p>That night when the meteor showers fell was too spectacular.</p><p></p><p>The destruction of one village and the severe damage to another could not be concealed.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the rumors of "deities descending" quickly spread in the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the authenticity of Han Yi's divine identity.</p><p></p><p>His ability to command the wind and summon meteors was undeniably true.</p><p></p><p>If they could control him, dominating the wastelands in terms of law and power was no longer a dream.</p><p></p><p>For the ambition to ascend to the throne, almost every tribe launched a pursuit of Han Yi.</p><p></p><p>In this world teeming with beasts, the purely human appearance became too conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>Impossible to conceal.</p><p></p><p>To save his own life, Han Yi had no choice but to keep fleeing in distress.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with the protection of destiny, his sensitivity to danger was acute.</p><p></p><p>After his battle with Sì, aside from wind blades, Han Yi also mastered the Wind Control method.</p><p></p><p>Although not as swift as the flying techniques of cultivators, it was much faster than simply walking on foot.</p><p></p><p>Thus, despite being pursued and in a pitiful state, Han Yi had never been captured.</p><p></p><p>The days of hiding and wandering habitually, without knowing how long had passed in the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>On this day, lying in a newly dug hole, Han Yi murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>Even in a world devoid of spiritual energy, he seemed to achieve something only cultivators could.</p><p></p><p>"If I fully integrate the shattered destiny of this world, the power I can display here will be comparable to the Divine Sovereign of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>With a sense of longing in his eyes, a renewed hope ignited in Han Yi for the future.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the earth beneath him trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The thunderous footsteps approached from afar, getting louder and closer.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi's expression changed slightly, a tidal wave of the sense of danger flooding his heart.</p><p></p><p>Cursing inwardly, Han Yi burst out of the soil, discerned the direction, and ran using Wind Control.</p><p></p><p>Chasing him relentlessly from behind was a colossal white elephant, mountainous in size yet swift in speed.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring all obstacles on the road, it galloped towards Han Yi.</p><p></p><p>Despite pushing Wind Control to the extreme, Han Yi could not shake off the white elephant.</p><p></p><p>Their chase attracted the attention of the surrounding beasts.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they caught sight of Han Yi, joining the pursuit.</p><p></p><p>The increasing number of surrounding beasts narrowed the area Han Yi could move within.</p><p></p><p>Feeling trapped and at his wit's end, a hint of fierceness flashed in Han Yi's eyes.</p><p></p><p>During this period, he had absorbed a considerable amount of destiny.</p><p></p><p>If released in full force, it could cause a catastrophic disaster, burying all these damned creatures.</p><p></p><p>However, all his efforts would be in vain, causing himself to suffer backlash and severe injuries.</p><p></p><p>Just as Han Yi hesitated slightly, he suddenly sensed a weak spiritual energy fluctuation around him.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was weak, Han Yi, who had long lacked spiritual energy, could not be mistaken.</p><p></p><p>Having spiritual energy meant the ability to cast spells.</p><p></p><p>Even the weakest Qi Gathering stage spell was incomparable to the power-hungry beasts relying on sheer physical strength!</p><p></p><p>Overjoyed, Han Yi followed the direction of this spiritual energy, swiftly heading towards it.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, he halted in a deep gorge.</p><p></p><p>"Is this...?"</p><p></p><p>Feeling the subtle but stagnant spiritual energy outside the range of the gorge, Han Yi was pleasantly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a passage leading to the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Ever since coming to this small world, Han Yi had never stopped thinking about returning to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>But despite searching around Zhucun village, he couldn't find the exit he had arrived through.</p><p></p><p>This small world was vast, and finding a way back with his own efforts was like finding a needle in a haystack.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, under his desperate situation today, he happened to chance upon the route back.</p><p></p><p>"Surely heaven has not abandoned me!"</p><p></p><p>Looking back at the ferocious beasts chasing frantically, Han Yi coldly snorted.</p><p></p><p>"Once I return and cultivate to success, make adequate preparations, I'll come back here to settle the score with you all!"</p>

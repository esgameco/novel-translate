            <p>I'm sorry, but you haven't actually provided the Chinese novel excerpt that you would like me to translate. Could you please share the specific Chinese text you need translated into English? I'd be happy to help translate it, as long as it doesn't contain any copyrighted material or excessively long passages. Just provide the Chinese text and I'll do my best to accurately translate it to English for you. Let me know if you have any other questions!</p><p></p><p>I'm sorry, but you didn't include the excerpt from the Chinese novel that you wanted me to translate.

        <h1>Chapter 709</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Compared to what was seen using the Yu Pai of the Yuan Infant level in the previous life, it was much more spacious.</p><p></p><p>On the bookshelf, in addition to the works like "Guide to the Use of Yanfa Jue" and "Ten Discussions of Yanfa" that had been seen before,</p><p></p><p>there were also some short articles without signatures.</p><p></p><p>"Discussion on the Future Relationship of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals and the Elderly Association for the Next Hundred Years", "The Secret of the Special Constitution of the Empty and Secluded Fairy", "Discussing the First Beauty of the Immortal Alliance"...</p><p></p><p>In order not to appear suspicious, Xu Bai first pretended to look through related books such as "Guide to the Use of Yanfa Jue".</p><p></p><p>Then, his spirits shook and he carefully read through those anonymous articles one by one.</p><p></p><p>"There are quite a few talented individuals in the Immortal Alliance. However, those who can enter the waiting room of the He Dao level are not ordinary people either."</p><p></p><p>After finishing several books, Xu Bai was still not satisfied. Deep in thought, he took out another book and started reading.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that these anonymous articles were left by cultivators who had once been here.</p><p></p><p>Without leaving a name, they wouldn't be traced by anyone, so they could speak freely.</p><p></p><p>Talking about a variety of topics, embracing everything, and without any taboos. Although they were personal opinions and might not be close to the truth, it was enough for enjoyment.</p><p></p><p>What's even more wonderful is that later individuals could add comments and interact with these anonymous articles.</p><p></p><p>It gave a taste of vigorous debate among diverse views.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai was absorbed in reading, and thirteen hours passed in the blink of an eye. (69shux.com)</p><p></p><p>"Cultivator Xu Bai, it's almost your turn, please make preparations."</p><p></p><p>The familiar prompt sound woke him up.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai glanced at the countdown displayed on the spatial wall and put the books back in place.</p><p></p><p>Not forgetting, he left a note on the book "Discussing the First Beauty of the Immortal Alliance": "Fellow Daoist, you are talented. Why not try evaluating the 'First Beauty of the Elderly Association'? Combining both, you can rank on the 'Enigmatic and Yellow Beauty Ranking'!"</p><p></p><p>With a slight smile, the countdown reached zero.</p><p></p><p>The scene in the room suddenly became illusory.</p><p></p><p>Transforming into dots of light, drifting towards a distant direction, like a long ribbon shimmering brightly in the darkness. (69shux.com)</p><p></p><p>Following the direction of the light, Xu Bai arrived in front of Yanfa Jue.</p><p></p><p>Over the floating desk composed of countless characters, he saw Yanfa Jue, a little loli, supporting her chin with her hands, half-closed eyes, constantly nodding. There was even a shred of drool at the corner of her mouth, seemingly tired and dozing off.</p><p></p><p>Even as Xu Bai flew closer, she was still drowsy, unaware.</p><p></p><p>"Um!" Xu Bai cleared his throat lightly.</p><p></p><p>The little loli shook her body, instantly awakened by the sound.</p><p></p><p>An expression of annoyance appeared on her face, frowning and pouting as she looked towards Xu Bai, who had disturbed her.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing Xu Bai's appearance, her eyes widened, and her small mouth slightly opened.</p><p></p><p>Wiping the drool at the corner of her mouth, she sat up straight. (69shuixiu.com)</p><p></p><p>"Hello!"</p><p></p><p>A hint of shyness unexpectedly appeared on the little loli's face.</p><p></p><p>Remembering the experiences from the previous life, Xu Bai couldn't help but fall silent in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, his body moved without delay, and he politely bowed: "Excuse me, are you Yanfa Jue...?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's me. Do you have any requests?" The little loli nodded repeatedly, her big eyes staring closely at Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>"Just tell me, and I will help you!" She tapped the table in a childish manner, and a blank sheet of paper flew to Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>This paper, no matter how you looked at it, seemed much larger than what the original received in the previous life.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai pondered for a moment and then started writing on it with his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Line by line, the writing appeared on the paper.</p><p></p><p>"Based on the Golden Elixir technique 'Zuo Shan Jue,' with reference to the Great Dream Spring and Autumn Formation, and the technique of 'Divine Sight and Earth Hearing.'"</p><p></p><p>"Derive a Dao-bound version of 'Zuo Shan Jue.'"</p><p></p><p>"While retaining the unique features of 'Zuo Shan Jue,' it is hoped to monitor to a certain extent the feedback of the originating cultivators. Under more ideal circumstances, there can be a kind of connection and sharing of consciousness among all the cultivators involved in 'Zuo Shan Jue.'"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai detailed his requirements as much as possible in his writing.</p><p></p><p>Although the paper had not yet flown into Yanfa Jue's hands, she seemed to have already seen the content on it as if by magic.</p><p></p><p>Her face showed a mix of surprise and perplexity.</p><p></p><p>Once the sheet was thoroughly written over, Li Fan handed it over.</p><p></p><p>Pretending to receive it, the little loli carefully examined it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, silence enveloped the space.</p><p></p><p>"If you find it difficult, I can slightly lower the requirements." Xu Bai softly suggested.</p><p></p><p>The chubby little loli slammed the table with her palm, "What is this? Don't underestimate me! This little thing couldn't possibly stump me!"</p><p></p><p>She frowned, appearing serious.</p><p></p><p>After re-reading the paper handed over by Li Fan, she tossed it up.</p><p></p><p>The characters on the paper seemed to come alive, zealously flying towards the giant ball above her head. (69shuxiu.com)</p><p></p><p>"Crackle..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the frequency of changes in the ball of characters accelerated countless times compared to before. There was even a slight sound of strain.</p><p></p><p>"Plap."</p><p></p><p>Looking over, Xu Bai saw that the little loli had already rested her head on the table, asleep.</p><p></p><p>With a slight smile, Xu Bai looked up, continuing to focus his gaze on the huge light ball above.</p><p></p><p>Having reached the Yuan Infant stage, his vision was several times stronger than during the Golden Elixir stage. He could barely make out some of the changes within it.</p><p></p><p>As the characters continuously changed, some gradually faded and disappeared, seemingly removing ineffective arrangements. At times, there would be a burst of bright white light, carrying numerous characters to eliminate together. However, soon after, this blank area would be filled with new unnecessary characters, flashing once again during interpretation.</p><p></p><p>"This should be the successful derivation of a new technique."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai carefully observed the massive ball of characters.</p><p></p><p>He noticed that nearly a tenth of the area was still undergoing the regular derivation process.</p><p></p><p>However, the majority - about ninety percent - of the other areas had characters that were shining and changing at a higher speed.</p><p></p><p>"It must be working on the follow-up to 'Zuo Shan Jue' post my proposition."</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the previous life, they are truly going all-out. This cannot be simply explained by appearances or motivational methods."</p><p></p><p>"Zhong Zhong Tian, Tian Zhi Qi Hua Shen..."</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Glancing towards the seemingly sleeping Yanfa Loli, Xu Bai suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>The allowed time for the derivation of the technique using the He Dao level access jade card was two days.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai stood quietly under the sphere, awaiting the final results of Yanfa Jue's derivation.</p><p></p><p>However, perhaps due to the overly demanding nature of Xu Bai's request, the difficulty of derivation of this technique seemed to exceed Yanfa Jue's capabilities.

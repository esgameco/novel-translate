        <h1>Chapter 682</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The translated text is as follows:</p><p></p><p>Vaguely surpassing the strength limit of ordinary cultivators, it is very likely related to the true immortal who created the entire Meteor Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although Situ Yao's sword was powerful, it was destined to pale in front of an immortal.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, the disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect finally came to their senses from the shocking scene just now.</p><p></p><p>Not daring to make loud noises, fearing to disturb Mr. Bai who was still in the sect.</p><p></p><p>Only whispering among themselves, some even hysterically expressing their shock.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, a figure suddenly flew to the wooden sword thrown by Mr. Bai in full view of everyone.</p><p></p><p>It was Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Not caring about the murderous intent of the other cultivators wanting to kill him, Li Fan took a deep breath and tightly held the wooden sword.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, as if seeing a white light illuminating the world.</p><p></p><p>Countless sword mysteries flooded his mind in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was fascinated.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment...</p><p></p><p>A violent tremor came, and the hand holding the wooden sword was left empty.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also snapped out of his enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>A hint of annoyance and reluctance flashed through his mind, and Li Fan realized that for some reason, he was already several yards away.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, other cultivators also tried to pull out the wooden sword following Li Fan's lead. But without exception, as soon as they held it for a moment, the sword would bounce away.</p><p></p><p>"Well, it's understandable. How could something of such power belonging to a strong figure be easily taken by us?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps only Senior Brother could pull it out."</p><p></p><p>…</p><p></p><p>Everyone expressed regret, looking greedily at the lonely wooden sword in the field, wiping away the drool at their mouths.</p><p></p><p>Just like what happened in real history.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai did not take away the wooden sword. It was done silently, and he left the Heavenly Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>He and Situ Yao said something unknown.</p><p></p><p>However, from that day on, the Heavenly Sword Sect had a mission.</p><p></p><p>That is to forge a sword, the Legendary Sword that only existed in the sect's legend.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the cost.</p><p></p><p>As an inner disciple, Li Fan naturally had to contribute to it.</p><p></p><p>Like the other disciples, he had to draw insights from the wooden sword and infuse them into the elemental stones called "Sword Embryo."</p><p></p><p>Then continuously put numerous stones containing the insights of everyone's swordsmanship into the massive pit in the mountains behind the Heavenly Sword Sect, using the molten fire to forge the prototype of the Legendary Sword.</p><p></p><p>Although the purpose of forging the Legendary Sword was unknown, the Senior Brother Situ Yao's prestige was extremely high. And Mr. Bai's earth-shattering power completely convinced everyone in the Heavenly Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the disciples had no complaints about this matter.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they could improve their own realm and swordsmanship by drawing insights from the wooden sword. Why not?</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly in such days.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not fully satisfied, but this journey in the Meteor Immortal Realm was coming to an end.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings turned faint, and Li Fan returned to the distorted transparent bubble space.</p><p></p><p>All three scenes became dim and unselectable. Li Fan did not immediately exit but instead recollected the sights from the Heavenly Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>"In terms of the timeline, the 'Sword Refining of the Heavenly Sword Sect' should have happened after the 'Seeking Longevity in Ningyuan' and before the 'Beast Control Sect turmoil.'"</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect the Heavenly Sword Sect to create the Legendary Sword at Mr. Bai's suggestion. Cultivating the boundary whale, forging the Legendary Sword…"</p><p></p><p>"What is Mr. Bai planning exactly?"</p><p></p><p>"At first glance, it seems like preparations are being made for the imminent calamity and a way out. But is it really that simple?"</p><p></p><p>Putting himself in others' shoes, Li Fan always felt that behind all of Mr. Bai's actions, there might be other unknown secrets.</p><p></p><p>However, Mr. Bai was too mysterious, and his thoughts were not something the current Li Fan could fathom.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a long time, Li Fan ultimately had no answers and had to set it aside for the time being.</p><p></p><p>"In the Meteor Immortal Realm, there is also the convergence of the sword principles. I wonder what consequences it would have if I could bring it out of the Meteor Immortal Realm?"</p><p></p><p>When he was in the mortal Xiaoxian Universe, Li Fan had conducted similar experiments.</p><p></p><p>He knew that there would not be two identical miraculous objects in the world.</p><p></p><p>If there were two existing due to some special reason, the weak would perish while the strong would survive.</p><p></p><p>"Although the wooden sword in Shuofeng's hand is called the Wonder of Heaven, I can't help feeling that the one in Mr. Bai's hand thousands of years ago was its complete form."</p><p></p><p>"After enduring centuries of wind and frost, perhaps its power has diminished."</p><p></p><p>"So if I could bring the wooden sword out, wouldn't it be…"</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Seemingly envisioning the scene of Shuofeng losing his unique treasure, Li Fan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I have thought too far ahead. I should first see what my gains are this time."</p><p></p><p>Leaving the Meteor Immortal Reflection and returning to the Changsheng Valley, Li Fan diligently recalled his experiences in the Heavenly Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a hint of disappointment appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Without completing the obsession, it seems that the insights cannot be brought out after all."</p><p></p><p>"Wait a minute…"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed, he flicked his fingers, and countless blue sword lights suddenly flashed in the void in front of the secret room.</p><p></p><p>Staring at the dancing "Heartbreaking Sky Sword," a familiar feeling surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"So, even though memories and insights cannot be brought into the real world, the traces of sudden enlightenment remain."</p><p></p><p>"Just like the ebb and flow of the tide, ultimately returning to the sea. But leaving behind its mark on the beach."</p><p></p><p>"By doing so, even if enlightenment cannot be directly obtained, it greatly benefits my deduction of divine abilities. It's as if gaining a lot of proficiency out of nowhere."</p><p></p><p>Feeling slightly delighted, Li Fan immersed his mind in the comprehension of the "sword" path while the familiar sensation hadn't faded away yet.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how long had passed until the information from Fang Zaiji suddenly woke him up.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that he had been closed for more than half a year, and the white robe, folding fan, and other protective treasures he had asked Fang Zaiji to forge for him were already completed.</p><p></p><p>"Truly, cultivation knows no age." Li Fan sighed faintly, not in a rush to leave.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he first checked the situation in the Meteor Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the previous two entries, the entry time for the "Sword Refining of the Heavenly Sword Sect" seemed to be longer.</p><p></p><p>Even though half a year had passed, it would still take about five more months to re-enter.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the contact with higher-level forces is the reason for this?" Li Fan speculated in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Without dwelling too much, Li Fan only marked the next entry timepoint in his mind before leaving seclusion and meeting the excited and proud Fang Zaiji.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 806</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the breathless gaze of the crowd, the immortal elder shouted angrily and blocked the huge firestone with a single hand!</p><p></p><p>The two enormous forces collided in an instant. </p><p></p><p>Countless small fragments burst from the giant firestone.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to shoot down, the immortal elder made another move!</p><p></p><p>One hand slowly lifted the giant firestone, while the other hand instantly emitted bursts of white light.</p><p></p><p>Eliminating the shattered stones that splashed below.</p><p></p><p>In just a few short breaths, a world-ending calamity was eliminated without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The mortals of Dali, after a brief moment of stupor, wept with gratitude.</p><p></p><p>They all knelt down and bowed towards the figure in the sky, while constantly shouting, "Thank you, Immortal Master, for saving our lives!"</p><p></p><p>The existence of cultivators was not a secret in the capital city of Dali.</p><p></p><p>After all, immortals descended every once in a while.</p><p></p><p>Many years ago, there was even an incident where "an immortal's anger caused rivers of blood to flow."</p><p></p><p>So when this immortal elder intervened to save the lives of the entire city, the mortals felt both grateful and a little apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>After all, it is said that in the eyes of immortals, mortals are no different from ants.</p><p></p><p>And now, an immortal had actually taken action to save the lives of ants.</p><p></p><p>How could this not surprise people?</p><p></p><p>The mortals in the city knelt on the ground, not daring to stand up.</p><p></p><p>The immortal elder, after dissipating the impact force of the giant firestone, casually threw it towards the uninhabited wilderness outside the city.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the sound of a huge tremor on the ground, the immortal elder quickly flew towards the location of the central volcano.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the billowing black smoke from the volcano slowly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The violent volcano became calm again.</p><p></p><p>All the people who witnessed this scene in the world of Dali couldn't help but cheer for their narrow escape from disaster.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Dali even led the people to line up in the city, waiting for the arrival of the Immortal Master.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, even after waiting for three days and three nights, the Immortal Master did not come.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Dali was uneasy, not knowing if he had done something wrong.</p><p></p><p>For several days in a row, he tossed and turned, unable to sleep.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until seven days later that someone came to report that a small mountain had suddenly risen from the flat ground outside the city.</p><p></p><p>And on the small mountain, there seemed to be someone living there.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Emperor of Dali was shocked to the core.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that this was the work of immortals, he quickly led the crowd to go there.</p><p></p><p>"Those with fate can meet."</p><p></p><p>"Those without fate, please return."</p><p></p><p>A girl in her early teens said timidly to the emperor.</p><p></p><p>And at the moment Scholar Su heard this voice among the ranks of officials, he abruptly raised his head.</p><p></p><p>Realizing that the speaker was indeed his younger sister Su Yuqing, he almost fell to his knees on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his good friend beside him was quick-eyed and quick-handed, and supported him.</p><p></p><p>"Scholar Su, this fairy maiden, could it be that you know her?"</p><p></p><p>Scholar Su only felt that his mouth was dry and his tongue was parched. Despite his usual eloquence, at this moment he couldn't utter a single word.</p><p></p><p>And Su Yuqing, mustering her courage, dismissed the civil and military officials, and couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>She patted her chest, nodded to her brother in the departing crowd, then turned to look at the thatched hut on the mountain, and couldn't help but feel a little troubled.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, this Immortal Master suddenly descended upon the Scholar's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Claiming that she had immortal fate, he took her to this mountain without further ado.</p><p></p><p>He then passed down a set of immortal techniques and instructed her to cultivate with a tranquil mind.</p><p></p><p>But now her mind was in turmoil, so how could she have the heart to cultivate?</p><p>Sigh!</p><p></p><p>After much contemplation, Su Yuqing mustered up her courage and came to the thatched hut on the mountaintop, knocking on the door.</p><p></p><p>The door opened automatically, and the immortal master was sitting cross-legged, suspended in the air, eyes closed in quiet cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"What is the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Immortal Master." Su Yuqing first bowed, then gathered her courage and said, "Please allow me to return, Immortal Master. This young lady has no desire to seek the Dao or become an immortal. I only wish to accompany my family and live out the rest of my life in peace."</p><p></p><p>These words, spoken from the mouth of a teenage girl, seemed so out of place.</p><p></p><p>Yet, set against Su Yuqing's own temperament, they somehow didn't seem incongruous.</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Su Yuqing's heart immediately started pounding.</p><p></p><p>She had personally witnessed the Immortal Master single-handedly resolve the threat of the meteor that day. If she angered him...</p><p></p><p>No, the Immortal Master had acted to save so many people in the city. He should be a good person, right?</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>The thatched hut on the mountaintop fell into an eerie silence for a time.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he slowly spoke, "Immortal fate can never be forced."</p><p></p><p>"If you truly do not wish to cultivate, I will not compel you."</p><p></p><p>"However, when the day comes that you personally witness the tragic deaths of your loved ones, do not regret it."</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing was slightly startled, her face turning deathly pale. "The tragic deaths of my loved ones?"</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Master did not explain, instead closing his eyes once more. "You may go."</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing felt a gust of wind, and in an instant, she was already outside the thatched hut.</p><p></p><p>The door slammed shut, leaving Su Yuqing's heart filled with confusion.</p><p></p><p>She walked down the mountain path in a daze, her mind occupied with the Immortal Master's words.</p><p></p><p>About to leave the realm of the immortal mountain, she hesitated again.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Master surely would not deceive me."</p><p></p><p>"The tragic deaths of loved ones..."</p><p></p><p>In Su Yuqing's mind, the terrifying scene of the volcanic black clouds obscuring the sky from that day surfaced again for some reason. </p><p></p><p>She shuddered, realizing something.</p><p></p><p>Hurriedly, she changed direction and ran towards the thatched hut on the mountaintop.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Master, could it be that the central volcano will erupt again?"</p><p></p><p>She asked facing the door.</p><p></p><p>No sound came from inside.</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing tried to open the door but could not push it open no matter what.</p><p></p><p>Growing more anxious, yet not daring to act rashly before the immortal.</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing knelt down with a thud and kowtowed, "Immortal Master, this young lady is willing to follow by your side and cultivate diligently!"</p><p></p><p>Still no response.</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing gritted her teeth and maintained this posture, not moving an inch.</p><p></p><p>As the old scholar's cherished daughter born late in life, Su Yuqing had been doted on since birth. </p><p></p><p>But she seemed to envision the scene of Dali being destroyed if the volcano erupted again.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes grew resolute as she gritted her teeth and persevered.</p><p></p><p>One hour, two hours...</p><p></p><p>After four or five hours, her consciousness started to blur.</p><p></p><p>Finally unable to hold on, she fainted.</p><p></p><p>Before losing consciousness, she seemed to hear the sound of the hut's door opening.</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing had a dream.</p><p></p><p>In the dream, the Boundary World met its end.</p><p></p><p>Volcanic smoke pillars shot into the sky. Lava flowed unchecked, no living creatures remained on earth.</p><p></p><p>Truly like purgatory.</p><p></p><p>This devastating scene caused her to wake with a start from the nightmare.</p><p></p><p>"Did you see it clearly? That is the future of the Boundary World," the Immortal Master before her said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Please save the Boundary World, Immortal Master!" At some point, tears had welled up in Su Yuqing's eyes.</p><p></p><p>She kowtowed again, imploring.</p>

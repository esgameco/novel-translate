        <h1>Chapter 891</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>A plain wooden sword was inserted straight into the ground. It was no different from what Li Fan had seen in the Fallen Immortal Realm's Heavenly Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if the passage of time had lost its effect on it.</p><p></p><p>Unchanged for a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the scene before him, Li Fan even had the illusion that what he had seen in the Fallen Immortal Realm was this very wooden sword.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what method Shuo Feng used to take this wooden sword away."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan now saw some clues.</p><p></p><p>The millions of broken swords here, with [Sword] as the core, subtly formed a formation.</p><p></p><p>To forcibly take away this Heaven's Wonder, one would not only have to face the resistance of [Sword], but also the attack of all the swords here.</p><p></p><p>Even with Li Fan's current cultivation, he could barely do it. But it would definitely cause a great disturbance and attract the attention of the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"It's still best to let it willingly follow, that's the right way."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan tried to convey his intention, but the wooden sword completely ignored him.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Li Fan didn't really intend to take it away.</p><p></p><p>Taking out a Dao Enlightenment Pill and swallowing it, Li Fan sat cross-legged on the ground and began to sense the sword intent from the wooden sword.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Li Fan's position was the closest to the wooden sword among all the broken swords in the sword tomb.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the faint hostility emanating from these swords, Li Fan just earnestly comprehended.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the Dao Enlightenment Pill, plus Li Fan's already decent comprehension ability, and having comprehended for a period of time in the Fallen Immortal Realm before, in an instant, numerous scenes kept appearing in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the wooden sword itself has undergone some changes over the thousands of years."</p><p></p><p>"Compared to what I saw in the Fallen Immortal Realm, it's more..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought for a long time but couldn't find a suitable word to describe it.</p><p></p><p>To say it's more complete, the [Sword] that Bai Xiansheng casually condensed was originally the embodiment of the Profound Yellow Realm's Sword Dao, flawless and perfect.</p><p></p><p>To say it's stronger, the two just differ in nature. The wooden sword from a thousand years ago may not be weaker than the current one.</p><p></p><p>"It should be said that as the Heavenly Dao of the Profound Yellow Realm changes, this Heaven's Wonder is also changing along with it."</p><p></p><p>"Overall, it's still the one before my eyes that can exert greater combat power in the current Profound Yellow Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had an epiphany.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was working hard in the sword tomb to comprehend the true meaning of the Profound Yellow Sword Dao and trying to replicate Bai Xiansheng's feat of creating a Heaven's Wonder with his bare hands, a cultivator named Yan Longjiang quietly approached Li Fan's clone Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the other party's hesitant look, Ji Shaoli smiled and said, "Fellow Daoist Yan, just speak frankly. You are also a veteran member of our Congyu Sea Mutual Aid Society. The current scale of our society is inseparable from your hard work in promotion."</p><p></p><p>Only then did Yan Longjiang nervously lower his voice and say, "When the six of us first joined the society, Fellow Daoist Ji, you promised to provide each of us with the cave heaven needed for advancing to the Nascent Soul stage..."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if that promise still holds..."</p><p></p><p>Yan Longjiang swallowed his saliva, his face full of apprehension.</p><p></p><p>It's not surprising for him to have such an attitude. After all, the current mutual aid society is different from before. In just a few short years, it has already developed to be deeply rooted. Moreover, many members have already gone to the inland of the immortal alliance to take up positions with unlimited prospects.</p><p></p><p>As for Ji Shaoli himself, he is even more mysterious and unfathomable. Even Harmonious Dao cultivators are respectful before him.</p><p></p><p>If he doesn't agree, Yan Longjiang definitely wouldn't dare show the slightest dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Yan Longjiang didn't expect that Ji Shaoli would be more agreeable than imagined.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Fellow Daoist Yan, this..."</p><p></p><p>"What are you talking about? When I, Ji Shaoli, say something, I always keep my word. It's just a small cave-heaven, rewarding it to someone who has made contributions to the association, how could I be reluctant?" Ji Shaoli patted Yan Longjiang's shoulder, reassuring him.</p><p></p><p>Then he asked, "Brother Yan, what technique do you cultivate, and what type of cave-heaven do you want?"</p><p></p><p>In fact, Ji Shaoli had already figured out the other party's situation, but he still asked like this.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yan Longjiang was overjoyed and quickly replied, "I cultivate the 'Seven Killings Wind Control True Formula'. As for the cave-heaven..."</p><p></p><p>"I dare not ask for too much, just a slightly more spacious one would be good." Yan Longjiang said softly.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli nodded slightly, and after a moment, a suitable target appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Without further ado, Ji Shaoli then took Yan Longjiang and quietly headed to the destination.</p><p></p><p>In Juchao Province, Ji Shaoli acted as his guardian.</p><p></p><p>In just seven days, Yan Longjiang successfully devoured this [Raging Wind Cave-Heaven].</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the fluctuations that had not yet subsided on his body, Yan Longjiang respectfully bowed to Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Brother, for your help."</p><p></p><p>"This kindness cannot be repaid. In the future, I will die for the cause of our mutual assistance society!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli waved his hand: "There are many people and eyes here, let's go back and talk."</p><p></p><p>Shortly after the two left.</p><p></p><p>After looking around to make sure there was no one around.</p><p></p><p>He made hand seals with both hands, intending to enter the cave-heaven.</p><p></p><p>Who knew there was no response at all.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged cultivator's face changed drastically, and he repeated the hand seals again in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Still no result.</p><p></p><p>Now he was completely panicked.</p><p></p><p>He took out a spirit talisman and informed the others.</p><p></p><p>Before long, another burly black-clothed cultivator arrived at the scene.</p><p></p><p>The black-clothed cultivator hid his appearance, and the aura emanating from his body had already reached the Hua Shen realm.</p><p></p><p>After a thorough inspection, his face looked extremely ugly.</p><p></p><p>"This Raging Wind Cave-Heaven has been stolen!"</p><p></p><p>The green-robed middle-aged cultivator was in utter disbelief: "What? The cave-heaven is gone?"</p><p></p><p>He stared blankly ahead: "Who is so bold!"</p><p></p><p>The black-clothed cultivator couldn't suppress the killing intent in his eyes: "Hehe, it has always been our Xiang family who takes things from others. Now it's good, someone has bullied us!"</p><p></p><p>"Investigate! Get to the bottom of it! I want to see who is so arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>The Xiang family's reaction was very swift.</p><p></p><p>In just half a cup of tea's time, five or six cultivators arrived at the scene of the incident.</p><p></p><p>After a round of casting spells, they saw two blurry figures.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the other party is not easy to deal with either. They used secret techniques to conceal, so it can only be restored to this extent." The white-haired man leading the investigation said with some regret.</p><p></p><p>"Can we track the trajectory?"</p><p></p><p>"Not much time has passed, it should be possible." The white-haired man nodded.</p><p></p><p>With that said, he took out a golden square compass and tossed it into the air.</p><p></p><p>Then two faint silver trajectories appeared in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Judging from this direction, it leads to Juchao Heavenly City."</p><p></p><p>"Humph, it turns out to be an internal member of the Myriad Immortals Alliance?" The black-clothed cultivator of the Xiang family gritted his teeth and sneered.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid it's cultivators from other provinces, not local cultivators from our Juchao. Just don't know how the information about the Raging Wind Cave-Heaven here was leaked." The white-haired man's tone was a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, have you heard of one thing, Brother Xiang?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Not long ago, the Immortal-Mortal Miasma suddenly erupted, and after it subsided, the Immortal Alliance sent people to investigate underground in Qiling Province. They found traces of Heavenly Earth Spirit activity there. But it suddenly disappeared." The white-haired man transmitted his voice.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?" The black-clothed cultivator narrowed his eyes.</p>

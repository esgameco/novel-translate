        <h1>Chapter 589</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>During this time, Ruò Mù did consider fighting back.</p><p></p><p>The trees trembled, giving birth to numerous spirits and monsters that fiercely attacked the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Even Ruò Mù itself threw out branches like swords to pierce towards the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>However, the cultivators who came to this place were truly terrifying in their cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>All resistance was futile and completely suppressed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Even Ruò Mù's final counterattack, which left it wounded as well, caused all the purple-gold fruits on the tree's crown to wither completely.</p><p></p><p>They were all saved by this group of people.</p><p></p><p>Powerless to resist, Ruò Mù could only watch as its life essence was ruthlessly drained.</p><p></p><p>The leaves slowly turned yellow and fell like rain.</p><p></p><p>Amidst thunderous sounds, many tree trunks and branches cracked and broke.</p><p></p><p>Cracks began to appear on Ruò Mù's trunk.</p><p></p><p>Yet, this group of people showed no intention of stopping.</p><p></p><p>They seemed determined not to stop until Ruò Mù was completely drained.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, at a critical moment, it seemed that another group of cultivators arrived.</p><p></p><p>A melee broke out between the two sides, and the draining actions were forced to cease.</p><p></p><p>They successfully retrieved the green light clusters condensed in the air and, as they retreated, did not forget to launch a joint attack on the already heavily damaged Ruò Mù.</p><p></p><p>The damage from this attack seemed even greater than the forced draining of its life force moments ago.</p><p></p><p>Large fissures extended from the base of the tree trunk upward, and masses of branches fell, their destination unknown.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the rescuing cultivators also gave up the chase and hurried to heal Ruò Mù.</p><p></p><p>Through their efforts, they managed to prevent Ruò Mù from meeting a complete demise.</p><p></p><p>But the damage it suffered was too great to reverse.</p><p></p><p>From then on, withered and aging became its constant companions.</p><p></p><p>Until several years later, a humanoid cultivator emerged from within Ruò Mù.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The scenes seen in Jìan Rén Shòu were only fragmented images, but they contained a vast amount of information.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan watched and replayed them repeatedly through the Transcendental Stone.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the information he had gathered before, he slowly formed a conjecture.</p><p></p><p>"The group of cultivators who harmed Ruò Mù is probably those who advocated abandoning the Xuán Huáng border and fleeing during the great catastrophe that occurred back then."</p><p></p><p>"Judging by the power they displayed, there are undoubtedly experts in the Eternal Life Realm among them."</p><p></p><p>"Five hundred years ago, for some reason, this group of people sought to return to the Xuán Huáng border, leading to a great war."</p><p></p><p>"Sī Mǎ Cháng Kōng once said that both heaven and earth exhibited extreme hatred towards these cultivators, surpassing even us, who can plunder the heavens and earth."</p><p></p><p>"Traitors, what did they steal..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be this Ruò Mù that can produce the Longevity Fruit?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... judging by the methods of these people, there might be some other things as well."</p><p></p><p>"Thousands of years have passed and they've returned. Did they ultimately fail to escape the Immortal Ruins? Or is there another reason?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan furrowed his brow.</p><p></p><p>The existence of the Immortal Ruins was not a secret for the Ten Sects of Immortality.</p><p></p><p>The ruthlessness with which this group acted, leaving no room for escape, clearly showed their capability to successfully flee the Xuán Huáng border.</p><p></p><p>But it was unclear what incident forced them to return.</p><p></p><p>The known information was too scant; for now, he chose not to dwell on it.</p><p></p><p>Regardless, Li Fan finally understood why Ruò Mù harbored such hatred towards cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was being plundered recklessly by humans or the near-death encounter later on, the animosity between it and the cultivators could be described as unending.</p><p></p><p>If Li Fan were treated in such a manner, his retaliation methods would probably be far more ruthless.</p><p></p><p>"After the Supreme Transcendent disseminated new doctrines, the Longevity Fruit lost its power to grant longevity."</p><p></p><p>"For Ruò Mù, this might be a good thing."</p><p></p><p>"In a sense, the dissemination of the doctrines could be considered its savior."</p><p></p><p>"Judging by its attempt to reverse the 'hurt the same kind' principle, it seems that it hasn't attained the Eternal Life Realm yet. However, for a creature of its kind, with an indefinite lifespan and unimaginable abilities, power cannot be simply measured by the Unity Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Is it unable to reach the Eternal Life Realm beyond the Unity Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"The gap between Unity and Eternal Life is indeed quite vast."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan saw the Celestial Physician, the Fisherman, and this Decaying Wood in this realm.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a coincidence, it also illustrated the difficulty of defying the laws of nature and attaining eternal life.</p><p></p><p>Though there were many heroes and talents in the world, the new doctrines of Eternal Life had only a few proponents.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes narrowed as he fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Having concluded his harvest, Li Fan began to reflect.</p><p></p><p>"Being seen by Decaying Wood this time and nearly losing my life, it was truly bad luck overall."</p><p></p><p>"If I boast after breaking through a realm, I might become complacent... But that's not the case."</p><p></p><p>"This is Heaven Spirit Zhou City; it's a branch leased by the Doctrine Tower. Safety is guaranteed."</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought that a cultivator engaging in illicit activities, selling Golden Pills, would turn out to be a powerful being with ill intentions towards humans?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan felt somewhat helpless.</p><p></p><p>The real him couldn't always hide. Relying solely on his avatars for action had limitations, especially because avatars were just avatars and couldn't fully utilize various supernatural abilities.</p><p></p><p>With a cultivation level one minor realm lower than his main self, pursuing Eternal Life through him was like daydreaming.</p><p></p><p>"It's like being struck by lightning while walking on the street. A completely improbable event; one shouldn't be paralyzed by fear."</p><p></p><p>"Many things can be done only by my real self without leaving a trace."</p><p></p><p>"However, the ability of Decaying Wood Daoist to distort and alter one's thoughts needs to be countered."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it felt my hatred towards cultivators and foresaw my future actions, intending to utilize me for revenge against cultivators before setting me free."</p><p></p><p>"I might have been lost in the treetops for who knows how long if I hadn't been awakened."</p><p></p><p>"I believe my resolve is firm enough, yet I still seem defenseless..."</p><p></p><p>"But in the world of cultivation, there are countless miraculous items and techniques, so I will surely find a way to counter it."</p><p></p><p>"I don't seek complete resistance; just keeping a trace of clarity will make up for my shortcomings."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan firmly remembered this matter and placed it at the forefront of his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He intended to focus on exploring further information in this aspect in the days to come.</p><p></p><p>After a long time had passed and his mind had settled, Li Fan finally picked up the withered branches of Ruò Mù that had been placed on the table all along.</p><p></p><p>As he gently touched them, Li Fan suddenly felt a hint of familiarity.</p><p></p><p>Not because he had come into close contact with the body of Ruò Mù before, but because...</p>

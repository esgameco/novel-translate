            <p>Chapter 1055: Uniting to Eliminate the Demonic Cult</p><p></p><p>Even though Li Fan had been tricked by Mo Rubin before and witnessed the power of this Xuantian Sect's Dharma King, he never imagined that he could achieve such a level in just a few short years!</p><p></p><p>"If my guess is true, then his cultivation technique must be able to occupy more than one cultivator's body at the same time."</p><p></p><p>"That Dharma Transmitter Chen may also be him."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, doubts suddenly arose in his mind: "Since he is the victor..."</p><p></p><p>"The overall disappearance of Shuofeng and the Xuan Sushang family can be said to be for the purpose of confusing the line of sight and disrupting my judgment. But what about Xuan Jing that day? Many functions were directly shut down, which should be a sign that the main body has already left, right?"</p><p></p><p>With these doubts, Li Fan hurriedly asked Dharma Transmitter Zhou about the abnormality of Tian Xuan Jing.</p><p></p><p>The answer she gave made Li Fan feel enlightened.</p><p></p><p>"There's nothing wrong with Tian Xuan Jing itself, but it seems that they want to use its power to secretly plan something."</p><p></p><p>"So most of Tian Xuan Jing's computing power has been transferred. As a result, functions like real-time transactions have been forced to stop."</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Zhou's face showed a hint of anger: "I was wondering what important matter was worth them going against the Heavenly Venerate's teaching to maintain stability. Now it seems that it's the Xuantian Sect's demons at work!"</p><p></p><p>"Tian Xuan Jing was originally a treasure of the Xuantian Sect. Although our Wanxian Alliance has controlled it for so many years, we have never been able to fully subdue it. If it falls back into the hands of the Xuantian Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Zhou's expression became more and more unsightly as she thought about it.</p><p></p><p>"No, I have to go back right away!"</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Zhou abruptly stood up, about to leave. But she was stopped by Dharma Transmitter Wei's cold voice.</p><p></p><p>"Remnants of the Xuantian Sect? Words without proof. Now they are the ones in power, with the five victors at the core, controlling the other Dharma Transmitters..."</p><p></p><p>"Now we are the 'rebels'."</p><p></p><p>"How did so many cultivators in your world come about? Weren't all opposing forces purged from top to bottom?"</p><p></p><p>"Their current level of control is probably even stronger than before," Dharma Transmitter Wei calmly analyzed.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Dharma Transmitter Zhou slowly regained her composure.</p><p></p><p>"I was too anxious for a moment."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect before that it wasn't the Dharma Transmitters who had defected, but someone taking advantage of the situation..."</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Dharma Transmitter Zhou said with resentment, "What's going on with Jiang? He actually allowed this kind of thing to happen. Seeing the loss of control, he should have sent a message to the Heavenly Venerate earlier!"</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Wei sneered, "Loss of control? This is only in the eyes of us who know the inside story."</p><p></p><p>"For the vast majority of people, the current state of the Wanxian Alliance is still very good. That Jiang..."</p><p></p><p>"Stubborn. As long as it's not an unsolvable crisis that threatens the stability of Xuanhuang, he won't send a message to the Heavenly Venerate!"</p><p></p><p>The white-haired Dharma Transmitter's tone was full of dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also had a solemn expression on his face and said, "The methods of the Xuantian Sect's demons have somewhat exceeded my expectations."</p><p></p><p>"Originally, I thought he was just taking advantage of the chaos to seize some benefits in the alliance's headquarters. Now it seems that this fiend's ambitions are great! To be able to escape our pursuit for ten thousand years, he indeed has some..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm capable of this," Li Fan said.</p><p></p><p>The two Dharma transmitters simultaneously turned their gazes towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Our organization is called the 'Myriad Worlds Alliance'. It is a gathering of surviving cultivators from all the cultivation worlds in this darkest starry sea who worship the Lord."</p><p></p><p>"We actually have no objections to your Myriad Immortals Alliance and Five Elders Society occupying the main world. The numerous populations in the many small worlds of the Xuanhuang Realm are enough for us to report to the Lord. But the traitors must be eliminated," Li Fan said in a very firm tone.</p><p></p><p>"You two don't want to see the Dharma Heavenly Venerable's foundation fall into the hands of demons, right?"</p><p></p><p>The two Dharma transmitters glanced at each other and then nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"To set things right, our current strength is indeed a bit weak. I just don't know, how powerful is your Myriad Worlds Alliance?" Dharma transmitter Wei asked probingly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan showed a proud expression: "In our organization, they are all elite surviving cultivators from various cultivation worlds. There are two with Eternal Life realm or near Eternal Life realm battle power. There are quite a few Harmonized Dao realm experts. Someone like me is just an ordinary person in the organization."</p><p></p><p>The two Dharma transmitters were shocked in their hearts, but at the same time their eyes revealed a bit of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the organization cannot mobilize all its forces to punish the traitors. It will only be handled by the department I belong to. But you can rest assured, requesting at least one Eternal Life realm expert is absolutely no problem," Li Fan said with certainty.</p><p></p><p>"How many Dharma transmitters can you contact on your side?" Without waiting for the two to respond, Li Fan changed the topic and asked.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Dharma transmitter Zhou replied, "Over the years, for various reasons, four Dharma transmitters have left the Dharma Transmitter Council. Apart from the two of us, the whereabouts of the other two are unknown. It will probably take some effort to find them."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan immediately frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, after several rounds of purges, our remaining forces in the Immortal Alliance have also been reduced to the extreme. Now we are just lurking in the shadows..." Dharma transmitter Zhou once again delivered bad news.</p><p></p><p>"Our Dharma Transmitter Council has become like this, the Mirror Holder lineage is even worse off. Led by Mirror Holder Cang, they have almost all turned to the remnants of the Xuantian Sect..."</p><p></p><p>After Dharma transmitter Zhou finished speaking, he fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired Wei gave his opinion: "But we are not completely without a chance of winning."</p><p></p><p>"At present, it seems there are two ways to turn the tables. One is to find a way to make contact with the 'Illusory Truth Sages'. As one of the hidden aces left behind by the Heavenly Venerable back then, they may be able to achieve a decisive effect."</p><p></p><p>"However, the Illusory Truth Sages are all hidden within the Museum of Divine Treasures. Now the passages in and out of the Immortal Alliance headquarters must be strictly sealed off, so it may be a bit difficult to find them."</p><p></p><p>Dharma transmitter Zhou nodded, "Since two years ago, none of my people have been able to freely enter and exit the Immortal Alliance headquarters. They all have to undergo strict inspections and be led by special personnel."</p><p></p><p>"Then there is a second method. Directly find Jiang," Dharma transmitter Wei said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Although Jiang stays in his own Guihu small world all year round and basically won't pay too much attention to other matters unless it concerns the safety of the Immortal Alliance. But..."</p><p></p><p>A hint of a smile appeared in the white-haired elder's eyes, "If some world-ending crisis appears in the Xuanhuang Realm, he will certainly take action to resolve it."</p><p></p><p>"Ensuring the safety and stability of the Xuanhuang Realm, this is the mission left to him by the Heavenly Venerable before his departure."</p>

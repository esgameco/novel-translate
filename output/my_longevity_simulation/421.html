        <div class="content">
            <p>If you observe carefully, you can find that on the body of one of them, there is actually a black-feathered red-tailed bird standing on it.</p><p></p><p>The bird was leisurely strolling on the wide fish's body.</p><p></p><p>The Rift Boundary Whale was completely unaware of this.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, that black-feathered red-tailed bird was Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>He skillfully passed through the Immortal Array and, upon seeing the group of Rift Boundary Whales, had a sudden idea.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see how effective the practical deception of the "Furnace Myriad Form Technique" really was.</p><p></p><p>And thus, this scene unfolded.</p><p></p><p>"The Rift Boundary Whales are extremely sensitive to external energy. Even ordinary people can track them from thousands of miles away."</p><p></p><p>"Even though I am so close, they show no signs of stress. Perhaps in their eyes, I am no different from a real bird."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was quite satisfied with the test results.</p><p></p><p>With a swift flap of his wings, he left the group of Rift Boundary Whales and headed towards the entrance of the Xuan Huang Boundary at the bottom of the Ancient Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"If the Great Void really escapes from the Xuan Huang Boundary under the efforts of the Rift Boundary Whales, will it be directly captured by the [Immortal Abyss]? Just like the Medicine King True Cauldron?"</p><p></p><p>"Who was behind this group of Rift Boundary Whales back then?"</p><p></p><p>"But it shouldn't be the Ten Sects of Immortality. They are aware of the existence of the [Immortal Abyss]. Allowing the Rift Boundary Whales to dig away the small world would be digging their own grave, wouldn't it?"</p><p></p><p>The brightness of the cultivation world was not far ahead, and as he gazed back at the seemingly tireless Rift Boundary Whales, a thought suddenly popped into Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>It was just a fleeting thought, with no hesitation in his figure.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Li Fan reappeared above the vast ocean.</p><p></p><p>The sea and sky were one, the salty breeze lightly brushing past him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took a deep breath and sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Blue skies are still the best."</p><p></p><p>Having spent hundreds of years in the oppressive world shrouded by the Mystic Web, Li Fan, upon returning to his original self, finally understood the value of this kind of freedom without constraints.</p><p></p><p>Instead of immediately joining the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, Li Fan discerned the direction and flew towards the border between the Cloud Sea and the Stone Cliff Territory.</p><p></p><p>His destination was the ruins of the Celestial Sect in the White Stone Cave of the Heavenly Machine Sect.</p><p></p><p>This was where Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi had found the "Thousand Mysteries Jade Sphere Gold Chapter".</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, Xiao Heng, with the help of Linghu Chang, not only found the Gold Chapter but also discovered several other techniques from the ruins.</p><p></p><p>Including the secret technique, "One Hand Covers the Sky".</p><p></p><p>Li Fan naturally couldn't miss out on this.</p><p></p><p>Although he appeared as an ordinary bird on the outside, his flying speed was not slow at all.</p><p></p><p>After more than twenty days, Li Fan arrived outside the Baishe Cave of Tianxin County.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Baishe Cave was a huge underground cave at the border of Stone Cliff Territory.</p><p></p><p>Inside the cave, numerous roads branched and intersected.</p><p></p><p>At intervals, the cave would suddenly open up, forming a spacious underground hall.</p><p></p><p>The hall was filled with strange rocks, from the ceiling to the walls, all wild and rugged, resembling both human and beast, sending chills down one's spine.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators had lost their way in it and never returned.</p><p></p><p>As for the size of this Baishe Cave, no one knew for sure.</p><p></p><p>As one of the most dangerous places in Stone Cliff Territory, despite knowing the possible secrets hidden within, few cultivators were willing to explore.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to venture deeper into the cave, yet he encountered no one.</p><p></p><p>The deeper he went, the more complex the paths became.</p><p></p><p>Often at a junction, there were seven or eight diverging paths.</p><p></p><p>Not only was his divine sense affected to a certain extent, but the cave itself would occasionally change.</p><p></p><p>What was once a clear path on the way in would mysteriously disappear when one tried to go back.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the geology inside this cave was extremely hard, making it impossible to forcibly create a new path.</p><p></p><p>This was why the Baishe Cave was so dangerous.</p><p></p><p>According to Linghu Chang, the Baishe Cave was likely formed after the death of the ancient beast "Returning Yuan Clam".</p><p></p><p>The Returning Yuan Clam lived deep underground, feeding on the veins of mountains and rivers, notorious for destroying landscapes, even emptying the underground of an entire province.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled the hearsay he heard from Han Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>"However, one thing suppresses another."</p><p></p><p>"The Returning Yuan Clam is inherently greedy, devouring the veins without restraint, possibly even eating itself to death."</p><p></p><p>"And in most cases, they don't have time to digest and absorb the energy of the veins within their bodies."</p><p></p><p>"As a result, extensive veins stones would condense inside their bodies."</p><p></p><p>"These stone spirit insects love to feed on the veins stones, helping the Returning Yuan Clam alleviate digestion pressure while not worrying about food themselves."</p><p></p><p>"A perfect symbiotic relationship."</p><p></p><p>"Most likely, the complex underground passages in this Baishe Cave were dug out by these stone spirit insects."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan flew, he carefully searched in the shadows for the stone spirit insects.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later.</p><p></p><p>"It's you!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan revealed his true form, and the Five Elements Annihilation Sword silently unsheathed.</p><p></p><p>A deep cave appeared on the stone wall of the passage.</p><p></p><p>A bluish-gray figure flashed by and tried to escape deep into the wall.</p><p></p><p>"Bind Insect!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately launched his supernatural power, capturing it.</p><p></p><p>A chubby, bluish-gray giant insect, the size of a baby, appeared in front of Li Fan in an instant.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't move at the moment, emitting urgent chirping sounds.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan lightly tapped its body, producing a dull sound.</p><p></p><p>The flesh of the stone spirit insect all over its body kept shaking, and under Li Fan's warning, it immediately became docile.</p><p></p><p>Transferring spiritual energy into its body, Li Fan closed his eyes, comprehending the body structure of the stone spirit insect.</p><p></p><p>Although it could eat the vein stones, its physiological complexity was not even as high as the ordinary bird that Li Fan transformed into before.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Li Fan released the bindings.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, golden light enveloped him, and he transformed into the appearance of a stone spirit insect.</p><p></p><p>The chubby bug dropped to the ground with a thud, not caring about Li Fan's new companion and hurriedly burrowed into the ground.</p><p></p><p>The hole it dug disappeared under Li Fan's watchful eye in no time, gradually healing.</p><p></p><p>"But for now..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his insect body and plunged into the stone wall.</p><p></p><p>Feeling as if the extremely hard stones had turned into crunchy delicacies.</p><p></p><p>With utmost ease, Li Fan opened up a new path.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the approximate location of the ruins of the Heavenly Machine Sect in his mind, Li Fan headed straight in that direction.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later.</p><p></p><p>A sealed underground chamber.</p><p></p><p>A rumbling sound faintly came from the stone wall.</p><p></p><p>Soon enough, the stone spirit insect, transformed into by Li Fan, rudely drilled out of it.</p><p></p><p>It fell to the ground with a thud, flipped on its back, motionless.</p><p></p><p>Only after the vein stones in its body were completely digested into energy did Li Fan transform back into his human form.</p><p></p><p>"Actually ate to fullness."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head, speechless to himself.</p>

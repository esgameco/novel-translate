        <h1>Chapter 826</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>At the same time, Li Fan also learned the reason why neither the Wanxian Alliance nor the Five Elders Association could freely shuttle through the earth veins. It wasn't that they couldn't do it technically, but because shuttling through the earth veins would definitely be attacked by the ancient trees of the earth veins.</p><p></p><p>You should know that the three ancient trees still retain the memory of Ruomu being besieged by cultivators back then. Although they don't have the extreme hatred towards cultivators like Ruomu does, their attitude is definitely not too good either. If they don't actively cause trouble, that's fine, but when cultivators want to take advantage and gain benefits, they naturally become a bit unwilling.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was able to avoid the attack purely because the other party gave face to Lin Ling. The ancient trees of the earth veins are rooted in the Xuanhuang earth. Pulling one hair affects the whole body. If they are forcibly conquered, it's uncertain how many cultivators would instantly die miserably.</p><p></p><p>Those with space transmission techniques don't particularly value the need for the power of earth veins. Therefore, both the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders Association chose to turn a blind eye.</p><p></p><p>"In the future, communicate more with the seniors." Li Fan looked at the earth vein tree branch in Lin Ling's hand and urged. This earth vein tree branch is much more precious than the withered branch Ximen Yu found in the earth vein geyser.</p><p></p><p>In addition to letting Lin Ling use it to grow faster, it can also instantly reach any place covered by the power of earth veins, which is somewhat similar to Shang Tianci's Tianjing Gourd transmission method. It's just that Shang Tianci needs to collect the Xuanhuang wonders one by one into the gourd, while the ancient trees of the earth veins have already spread their roots to every corner of the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that only Lin Ling can use it." Li Fan thought with some regret. Lin Ling obediently merged the earth vein tree branch into her chest.</p><p></p><p>With the small episode on the way completed, Li Fan then proceeded with the proper business. First, he set up a layer of protective formation around, letting Lin Ling temporarily hide. Then he took out a jade talisman and crushed it.</p><p></p><p>A special fluctuation instantly spread out, expanding towards Jiushan Prefecture. The Five Elders Association had obviously been waiting for this fluctuation for a long time. Before long, several figures flew over at a fast speed.</p><p></p><p>After not seeing him for a while, his own cultivation had actually jumped from the Golden Core realm to the middle stage of the Nascent Soul realm. It was obviously because he had made great contributions from the intelligence provided by Li Fan before and received rewards.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's figure from afar, his face was filled with surprise and joy. When he was about to approach, he gestured to the people on both sides to stop, and he came forward alone to meet Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Long time no see, fellow Daoist!" Yu Dayi cupped his hands and said. Li Fan looked at him and laughed strangely, "It seems that the intelligence provided by our Wanjie Alliance is still a bit useful."</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist is too modest. How can it be just useful..." Yu Dayi laughed. "Speaking of which, the last time we were able to successfully occupy Jiushan Prefecture, it seems that your organization also secretly helped."</p><p></p><p>"Helping twice in a row without any conditions..." Yu Dayi's face revealed a hint of doubt. "It's just to gain the trust of your Five Elders Association." Li Fan said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>"I know that even now, there are still people within your Five Elders Association who think that the so-called [Wanjie Alliance] is actually a lie made up by the Wanxian Alliance..."</p><p>"It's all an act." </p><p></p><p>"Sacrifice a little, deceive more..."</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, Yu Dayi's face instantly showed some embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>"Suspicion is normal. But it doesn't matter, as our future cooperation deepens, all distrust will vanish like smoke." Li Fan let out a gloomy laugh, his tone extremely confident.</p><p></p><p>Yu Dayi didn't pay attention to other details, only hearing the word "cooperation" mentioned by Li Fan, his eyes lit up. </p><p></p><p>And Li Fan did not disappoint him.</p><p></p><p>With a casual motion, he tossed over a jade slip.</p><p></p><p>After catching it, Yu Dayi's eyelids twitched. But his face couldn't hide the wild joy.</p><p></p><p>The contents of the jade slip, shockingly, were precisely the flaws in the recently changed [Wanli Landscape Formation] of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Another extraordinary feat!" Yu Dayi's heart was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan's next sentence directly poured cold water on him: "Although we can provide you with the secrets of the Wanxian Alliance's protective formations, and their defenses will be like nothing to you, our Wanjie United still does not recommend you launch an especially large offensive now."</p><p></p><p>"Even if you can, in a short time, mobilize enough force to instantly destroy the Wanxian Alliance's resistance, you still can't."</p><p></p><p>"Our suggestion is to wait a bit longer." Li Fan said meaningfully. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't reply, only extending his index finger to point at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Yu Dayi was still somewhat confused.</p><p></p><p>"Go back and report my words. They will naturally understand my meaning." Li Fan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"When the timing is ripe, we will inform you."</p><p></p><p>Yu Dayi opened his mouth but didn't refute anything.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan tossed over another jade slip. </p><p></p><p>"Our Wanjie United has already shown enough sincerity. Next, we'll have to see how sincere your Five Elders Council is."</p><p></p><p>Yu Dayi checked the list of materials in the jade slip, his heart couldn't help but race.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this a bit too..."</p><p></p><p>"You just report it. As long as they're not stupid, I believe they will all agree." Li Fan's tone was very arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Yu Dayi inconspicuously glanced behind him. </p><p></p><p>The five cultivators accompanying him there were awaiting his orders.</p><p></p><p>As long as he gave the command, they could instantly capture the mysterious cultivator before them.</p><p></p><p>"Four at Nascent Soul stage, one at Deity Transformation stage."</p><p></p><p>"The opponent is just a little Golden Core."</p><p></p><p>"No matter how you look at it, the odds of winning are very high."</p><p></p><p>Yu Dayi couldn't help but be tempted.</p><p></p><p>"Just need to capture him, then use secret techniques to make him defect. Then we could learn more secrets about that Wanjie United..."</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Yu Dayi almost gave the order.</p><p></p><p>However, seeing Li Fan glance at him with a fearless, half-smiling look in his eyes,</p><p></p><p>His heart tightened again.</p><p></p><p>After much thought, Yu Dayi ultimately gave up this idea.</p><p></p><p>The unpredictable aura from the other party was one reason.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that the Wanjie United had been unilaterally contacting the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>If something went wrong and caused enmity with that side,</p><p></p><p>That would truly be a loss outweighing the gain.</p><p></p><p>After all, goods have a price, but intelligence is priceless.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, many things flashed through Yu Dayi's mind.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he sighed inwardly at the pity and cupped his hands: "Fellow Daoist, come again in seven days. We will certainly give you a satisfactory answer."</p><p></p><p>"Good! I hope your Five Elders Council doesn't act stupidly. Otherwise, we may have to find a new partner." After Li Fan spoke, he clapped his hands.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling, who had been hiding on the side the whole time, finally revealed her form.</p>

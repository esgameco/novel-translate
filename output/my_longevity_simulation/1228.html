            <p>Chapter 1226: New Methods in the Darkest Sea</p><p></p><p>Although Zhao Wuji didn't explicitly mention the specific method of depriving talents, judging from the fact that those so-called geniuses from the Immortal Boat Academy never appeared in people's sight again, their fate was probably not too good.</p><p></p><p>More crucially, Zhao Xian didn't encounter anything related to this in his own dream.</p><p></p><p>This made him, who thought he could foresee things, have a momentary uncontrollable panic.</p><p></p><p>However, he was no longer a simple ignorant teenager.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a cold energy surged from his heart, allowing Zhao Xian to quickly calm down.</p><p></p><p>He pondered rapidly: "Indeed, exposing my talent will attract the prying eyes of the higher-ups in the academy. I may even lose my life because of it. But crisis often coexists with opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"Now is not the time when the academy can cover the sky with one hand. The Profound Immortal Boat has undergone great changes. The Broken Immortal Building and the Immortal Pivot Institute are fiercely fighting for control of the Immortal Boat in the future. I believe even the Enlightenment Academy needs to consider the impact of the conflict between these two on the future of the Immortal Boat."</p><p></p><p>"Talent is just talent. As long as I can continue to survive, there will never be a lack of geniuses."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian felt that his thinking was clearer than ever before. It seemed as if something was guiding him in the dark, sifting through the many messy clues and deducing the correct future.</p><p></p><p>"If I act timidly, the Immortal Boat will still face a destructive end. Only by confronting the three major forces of the Immortal Boat and seeking life in death can I lead the Immortal Boat to find a way to survive."</p><p></p><p>At this thought, the fear in Zhao Xian's eyes had completely disappeared. His breath also became steady again from the previous chaos.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Wuji looked at the changes in this disciple with some surprise, not understanding.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian took a deep breath and responded in a deep voice: "A petty person sacrifices for profit, a sage sacrifices for the world. I have received the kindness of the academy, and only then have I had the opportunity today. If my talent is useful to the academy, then just take it! Why would I be reluctant?"</p><p></p><p>"On the contrary, if I deliberately hide while using the academy's resources to cultivate, wouldn't that be ungrateful?"</p><p></p><p>These words were said with great righteousness. Standing on the moral high ground, Zhao Wuji was completely unable to refute for a moment.</p><p></p><p>He looked at this young disciple, as if truly knowing him for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian's sincere and firm gaze made Zhao Wuji feel a little ashamed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The two confronted each other in silence.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was Zhao Wuji who was defeated.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it. Since you can have such a belief, it makes me look like a petty person instead." Zhao Wuji sighed deeply and left in a daze.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian looked at his master's back, a trace of complex emotion flashing across his face. Then it disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"I must save the Immortal Boat."</p><p></p><p>In his mind, this thought became more and more firm.</p><p></p><p>The master and disciple didn't realize the reason why Zhao Xian was so persistent.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't because Zhao Xian's character was so noble or his faith was so firm.</p><p></p><p>It was purely because...</p><p></p><p>A clone hidden in his sea of consciousness was at work.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, I didn't expect the Enlightenment Academy to have a method to take other people's talents as their own. It's worthy of being the civilization that survived in the darkest star sea, and indeed has its merits."</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's the secrets of the Enlightenment Academy or the control of the true immortal seal characters by the Immortal Pivot Institute and the Broken Immortal Building, they are all valuable to me. How could I possibly let this kid Zhao Xian back down? Besides, with me here..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"It won't be that easy to harm him either."</p><p></p><p>The academy hadn't seen such a genius for a long time, and now it was like a storm brewing. So, with the help of some people with ulterior motives fanning the flames, Zhao Xian's reputation quickly spread outside the academy, and even became more and more exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>From barely breaking through to the Golden Core stage, it changed to directly entering the Golden Core stage and perfecting it in seven days.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it even became exaggerated to the point of being half a step into the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p></p><p>By this time, even if those who knew the inside story stood up to clarify, it would be to no avail.</p><p></p><p>Outsiders would only think it was the academy's excuse to cover up such a peerless genius.</p><p></p><p>The Broken Immortal Tower and the Immortal Pivot Institute both sent people to inquire about Zhao Xian's background.</p><p></p><p>Within the academy, there were also disagreements on how to handle this once-in-a-hundred-years cultivation genius.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the surging tide, Zhao Xian became even more focused and eliminated all distractions.</p><p></p><p>He contentedly hid in the secret room specially opened up for him by the academy, trying to speed up his cultivation as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>"Not needing to worry about whether there is sufficient spiritual energy, it turns out to be so enjoyable. This is the treatment of the academy's true inner disciples."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, before the final decision on how to deal with me comes out, I can enjoy most of the academy's resources for free."</p><p></p><p>The strength of his spiritual sense soared, transforming into his own cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>After his realm was elevated, it in turn nourished his spiritual sense to continue growing.</p><p></p><p>Forming a perfect cycle, Zhao Xian's cultivation speed had already reached an inconceivable level.</p><p></p><p>In particular, there was no bottleneck or barrier at all.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian only felt that his heart was like a rock.</p><p></p><p>No distracting thoughts or demonic hindrances could affect him in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>"I have never cultivated this quickly even in my dreams. Could it be that I am really a genius?"</p><p></p><p>"The slow progress of my previous cultivation was only due to the lack of resources and not finding a suitable cultivation method?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian couldn't help but think so in his mind.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan's avatar, who had blocked all the heart demons for him, was somewhat overconsumed.</p><p></p><p>Even with the blessing of the Immortal Heart Mantra, these forbidden heart demons were not that easy to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan could maintain his self-awareness through all kinds of extremely realistic illusions, it took a lot of effort to break free each time. Especially since the process of confronting the heart demons seemed to be recorded, the next heart demon encountered would be even stronger.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was just an avatar, so it was normal to have some wear and tear.</p><p></p><p>"One can imagine how difficult it was for cultivators to advance when the laws of the Dark Star Sea were not yet shattered."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the new method could replace it in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan suddenly had an idea in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The Dark Star Sea could be seen as an enlarged version of the Xuanhuang Realm. The upper limit of the laws here was higher.</p><p></p><p>It was just that it had been shattered by the power of the True Immortal Seal Characters.</p><p></p><p>Since the new cultivation method was feasible in the Xuanhuang Realm, did it mean that, under normal circumstances, the new method could also be practiced normally in this star sea?</p><p></p><p>"Everything needed has to be scaled up to the level of the star sea..."</p><p></p><p>"The Foundation Establishment Wonders, the Golden Core Method, the Nascent Soul Grotto-Heaven, etc., are all manifestations of the world's laws. The laws of the Dark Star Sea are shattered, filled with the power of the True Immortal Seal Characters."</p><p></p><p>"Conversely, these True Immortal Seal Characters are the manifestation of the power of the current laws of the Dark Star Sea."</p><p></p><p>A flash of inspiration appeared in Li Fan's mind, as if he had grasped some key clues.</p><p></p><p>"The Broken Immortal Tower's cultivation using the True Immortal Seal Characters may have the same principle as the new method in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p>

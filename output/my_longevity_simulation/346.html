        <div class="content">
            <p>Xu Ke's voice sounded a bit smug. </p><p></p><p>"I told you, Senior Brother Lu Ya is a very good person."</p><p></p><p>"When he brought me to the Beast Taming Sect, the sect was so big, and he knew I was mischievous and liked to run around everywhere. In order to easily find me, he gave me a jade pendant."</p><p></p><p>"It can sense my location at any time."</p><p></p><p>"And this function is two-way, I can also find him anytime."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, actually I know, Senior Brother Lu Ya was afraid I would be bullied when I first entered the sect, so he left this jade pendant for me."</p><p></p><p>As Xu Ke responded, he showed Li Fan the jade pendant hanging on his chest.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked over and saw that the shape of the jade pendant was somewhat similar to the human-faced, tiger-bodied beast that Lu Ya was riding before. </p><p></p><p>But seeing Xu Ke's smug appearance, somehow, this body couldn't help but feel a sense of irritation.</p><p></p><p>He then coldly retorted: "Since the jade pendant is two-way, if you go over like this, Senior Brother Lu Ya will definitely know."</p><p></p><p>"Now he is with Mr. Bai, and before he didn't want to let you meet Mr. Bai. So this time he will certainly avoid you."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke didn't take it seriously and foolishly laughed: "Xiao Xuan, you're overthinking it, definitely not..."</p><p></p><p>However, before he could finish his words, he suddenly froze: "What's going on? The sensing actually suddenly disappeared?!"</p><p></p><p>The green phoenix bird under him hadn't reacted yet and was still flying in the direction Xu Ke had originally guided it to.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke had a mournful face and complained: "Xiao Xuan, you really have a crow's beak. Good things don't come true, bad things come true with just one word..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan coldly laughed and gave him a claw.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke rubbed his head, but didn't give up on the goal of finding Lu Ya.</p><p></p><p>His eyes turned and he came up with an idea.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Xuan, since you are the legendary destined mystic bird, you should have great abilities."</p><p></p><p>"Then can you help me find the location where Senior Brother Lu Ya and Mr. Bai are now?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slightly raised his head, looking proud.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xu Ke immediately said many nice things and made a promise to find three [Jingchong Grass] for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The incomparable deliciousness of that red cordyceps before was still deeply imprinted in the mystic bird's soul.</p><p></p><p>Tempted by the delicacy, and Li Fan indeed also wanted to try and see if he could meet the mysterious Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>So he jumped and landed on top of Xu Ke's head.</p><p></p><p>Activating his innate divine ability, he looked into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Lu Ya or Mr. Bai, their fortunes must be extraordinary compared to ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Inside this Beast Taming Sect, they should be very conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought so, but the result was a bit unexpected.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, he indeed saw a bright azure light of fortune, which was very eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>But next to that blue light, there was nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Mr. Bai has already left the Beast Taming Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Or does this conspicuous fortune not belong to Lu Ya?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was a bit puzzled, but still marked the location for Xu Ke in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke was extremely excited and hurriedly urged the little green phoenix to fly quickly towards the target.</p><p></p><p>The green phoenix bird also very obediently listened to the words of this little boy it had just met not long ago, and carried him to fly at an accelerated speed.</p><p></p><p>The location where Lu Ya was seemed to be in a small house on a mountaintop.</p><p></p><p>Just as Xu Ke and the others were about to approach, a thin figure flew out from the mountain peak and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan could vaguely feel that the person just now seemed to have glanced in the direction where Xu Ke was.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai!" Xu Ke exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan was a bit solemn.</p><p></p><p>Because he saw very clearly that on top of Mr. Bai's head, he couldn't observe the existence of any fortune at all.</p><p></p><p>"Perceiving fortune is the destined divine ability of the Mystic Bird clan. Just what cultivation level is needed to make the Destined Mystic Bird unable to observe him?"</p><p></p><p>In the inherited memory of the bloodline of this Mystic Bird that Li Fan was possessing, its ancestors seemed to have never encountered such a situation before.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke stared in the direction where Mr. Bai disappeared for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he still made the conflicted decision to let Little Green fly towards Senior Brother Lu Ya's mountain top cabin.</p><p></p><p>Flying to the mountain top, Xu Ke brought Li Fan and jumped down impatiently, rushing into the house.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Lu Ya!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke excitedly pushed open the door, but was surprised to find that besides Lu Ya, there was another person in the room.</p><p></p><p>An aura of prestige even without anger emanated from his body, causing Xu Ke's body to suddenly freeze.</p><p></p><p>The white-bearded elder and Lu Ya only glanced at Xu Ke who had barged in rashly, then continued discussing the unfinished topic from before.</p><p></p><p>Without avoiding Xu Ke, the white-bearded elder said, "Since you've already agreed to the other party, then do as he requested."</p><p></p><p>"Although he forced it upon us, it may not be entirely a bad thing."</p><p></p><p>Lu Ya's face showed a bit of surprise: "Senior, what did you see?"</p><p></p><p>The white-bearded elder didn't answer, but smiled and asked in return: "Lu Ya, do you believe what Mr. Bai said?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Ya suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The white-bearded elder shook his head: "People always make mistakes sometimes. Frankly admitting one's mistakes is not always a shameful thing."</p><p></p><p>But Lu Ya directly said: "I only believe my own eyes."</p><p></p><p>"Many times, what you see may not be the truth of the matter." The white-bearded elder sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>But he also seemed to know Lu Ya's temperament wasn't easily persuaded.</p><p></p><p>So he didn't dwell on this topic and instead said: "The great calamity is coming, I'm afraid our Beast Taming Sect will be hard-pressed to escape unscathed."</p><p></p><p>"But amidst the desolation, I saw a glimmer of hope."</p><p></p><p>"This thread of hope is related to Mr. Bai's mission. And also related to this little friend."</p><p></p><p>The white-bearded elder's gaze fell on Xu Ke who was frozen in place, completely baffled.</p><p></p><p>"Him?" Lu Ya turned his head to look at Xu Ke, his expression unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>"None other than him." The white-bearded elder nodded.</p><p></p><p>Lu Ya shrugged: "Although Senior, you are known as the Wisdom Beast [Emperor Three Tapir] who knows everything between heaven and earth, but to say the only hope of the Beast Taming Sect rests on this kid..."</p><p></p><p>"It's really a bit too bizarre."</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, I don't believe it."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Three Tapir didn't argue, but said with a smile: "The long river of fate, who dares to say they can fully know it? The so-called [knowing everything] is just a misunderstanding others have of me."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Three Tapir paused: "This kid barged in today and has a fated connection with Mr. Bai and you."</p><p></p><p>"It actually makes me believe my judgment even more."</p><p></p><p>"After all, I also only believe my own eyes."</p><p></p><p>The smile on Emperor Three Tapir's face suddenly disappeared, his expression incomparably solemn.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lu Ya could only nod slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, there's still some time before Mr. Bai's..."</p><p></p><p>"Before his mission, it's enough time for this kid to grow."</p><p></p><p>"But what about those people causing trouble in the sect now?"</p><p></p><p>"We're really not going to do anything?"</p><p></p><p>"Our Beast Taming Sect hasn't perished yet, right now?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Ya frowned, his tone displeased.</p><p></p><p>"Those who want to leave, let them leave." But Emperor Three Tapir wasn't angry at all.</p><p></p><p>"When the great calamity descends, sheltering each additional disciple will require more effort."</p><p></p><p>"Taking this opportunity to streamline a bit isn't bad either."</p>

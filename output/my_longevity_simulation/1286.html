        <h1>Chapter 1286</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>"Today is New Year's Eve, taking one day off. Will continue tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>The excerpt appears to be referring to the Lunar New Year holiday, also known as Spring Festival in China. The person is taking New Year's Eve off from work or other activities, and will resume the next day.</p><p></p><p>I apologize, but the text you provided appears to be incomplete and lacks sufficient context for me to provide a meaningful translation. It simply says "7000." followed by "Wishing all book lovers a Happy New Year!"</p><p></p><p>If you are able to provide a longer excerpt from the Chinese novel with more substantive content, I would be happy to attempt a full translation from Chinese to English for you, while being mindful of copyright considerations. Please feel free to share a more complete passage and I'll do my best to assist.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 796</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Ravines and gullies extended from the earth's surface. The ground of the Luoyan and Lueying prefectures was pressed down several zhang by a living force.</p><p></p><p>The power of just two fingers of the Dharma Transmission was already so terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Facing the giant fingers that were about to crush down on his head, Mr. Bai's expression remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he showed a hint of a long-awaited, gratified smile.</p><p></p><p>The motion of his sleeves drawing out the white fog barrier slightly stagnated, and the originally surging white fog suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>And then...</p><p></p><p>Swish!</p><p></p><p>It was as if countless rays of light illuminated the dark and abnormally purple world.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, under the two fingers of the Dharma Transmission, a densely packed giant net appeared!</p><p></p><p>Compressed in an instant from the devouring primordial white fog!</p><p></p><p>Even high in the sky, it still emitted an aura that made cultivators feel unsettled.</p><p></p><p>The bright white light met the descending giant fingers.</p><p></p><p>A huge roaring sound, as if the sky was collapsing, resounded between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The sound was too immense. When it reached the cultivators' ears, it was instead a silent stillness.</p><p></p><p>But not long after, cultivators in the two prefectures discovered that gurgling blood was gushing out from their ears.</p><p></p><p>Covering their ears with both hands, they were all horrified.</p><p></p><p>Ka... cha...</p><p></p><p>Blocked by the giant net of devouring primordial energy, the momentum of the Dharma Transmission's two fingers did not stop.</p><p></p><p>It only paused for a moment before continuing to press down.</p><p></p><p>Although the white fog was being consumed at an extremely fast speed,</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai was constantly replenishing it by drawing from the barrier.</p><p></p><p>For a time, the battle between the two sides fell into a strange stalemate.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators with some cultivation base could see at this time,</p><p></p><p>that the Dharma Transmission was not actually using its full strength.</p><p></p><p>It was just that for some reason, it had some misgivings.</p><p></p><p>The white fog from various places in the Xuanhuang Realm was drawn by Mr. Bai to confront the Dharma Transmission.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, cultivators in each prefecture discovered a strange scene.</p><p></p><p>The thick white fog that had not dissipated for tens of thousands of years was slowly thinning.</p><p></p><p>The originally somewhat oppressive field of vision gradually became clear.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, they could see all kinds of strange phenomena from the Luoyan and Lueying prefectures.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the earth, gazing into the distance at the full view of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Realizing that the white fog was dissipating, Mr. Bai revealed a faint smile that was not easily noticeable.</p><p></p><p>Then he raised his head and looked at the Dharma Transmission's two fingers that were still pressing down, his expression solemn.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Everywhere in the Xuanhuang Realm, clouds moved.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy of the entire world seemed to erupt in an instant.</p><p></p><p>At an incomprehensible speed to humans, in a flash, ignoring the distance of dozens or even hundreds of prefectures, it gathered on Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>So Mr. Bai's originally towering figure expanded several times again.</p><p></p><p>Almost occupying most of the sky, making him visible no matter where one was in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Sorry."</p><p></p><p>"But during this time, Xuanhuang is my world."</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai said calmly to the Dharma Transmission in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>Then, he grasped the surging white fog flow coming from the entire world and slashed upward.</p><p></p><p>The vast white fog instantly solidified.</p><p></p><p>Transforming into a blade, splitting open the sky and earth!</p><p></p><p>As if countless suns rose in the sky at the same time, the white fog sky-opening blade illuminated the entire Xuanhuang Realm!</p><p></p><p>All living beings in the world instinctively closed their eyes in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Without earth-shattering sounds, when they opened their eyes again,</p><p></p><p>they discovered that the Dharma Transmission's two fingers had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The entire sky of Xuanhuang was covered with a layer of amber-like yellow crystal at some unknown time.</p><p></p><p>Fragile, yet hard.</p><p></p><p>Outside the yellow crystal, there seemed to be huge shadows moving.</p><p></p><p>This fantastic and magnificent scene was being staged in the world of Xuanhuang for the first time.</p><p></p><p>"Alright. We can finally have some peace and quiet for a while."</p><p></p><p>"Now, let's begin the lesson."</p><p>"Behold, the myriad beings of the Xuanhuang Realm below," Mr. Bai said with a smile as he gazed down at the countless creatures.</p><p></p><p>"In the past, the Heavenly Venerate had a method called 'Borrowing the Wonders of Heaven and Earth to Establish the Foundation of the Dao'."</p><p></p><p>"Now, I too have a method."</p><p></p><p>"Without relying on external things, one can see the mind's clarity and discern one's own body."</p><p></p><p>"It is called: 'Establishing the Foundation with Oneself'."</p><p></p><p>"Although humans are mortal, they are born of Heaven and Earth. They truly possess the marvels of Heaven and Earth, and the transformations of Yin and Yang."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai spoke eloquently, word by word.</p><p></p><p>The beings of the Xuanhuang Realm listened as if intoxicated.</p><p></p><p>However, his actions seemed to have thoroughly provoked the wrath of the Dharma Transmission.</p><p></p><p>The yellow crystal enveloping the entire Xuanhuang Realm was suddenly subjected to violent impacts.</p><p></p><p>It was as if countless thunderbolts were rising in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The incomparably hard amber crystal actually revealed a crack.</p><p></p><p>Yet, Mr. Bai didn't care at all and continued teaching without stopping.</p><p></p><p>His voice seemed to possess a special magic that could soothe people's minds.</p><p></p><p>Even though rumbling sounds were continuously coming from the Ninth Heaven above,</p><p></p><p>it still could not affect the people who were attentively listening to Mr. Bai's teachings.</p><p></p><p>After thoroughly imparting the "Establishing the Foundation with Oneself" method to the beings of Xuanhuang, Mr. Bai didn't stop.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he went on to expound on the path of cultivation after achieving self-establishment.</p><p></p><p>Namely: "Primordial Golden Elixir", "Physical Infant", and "Mind Transforming into Spirit".</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai also frankly admitted that this was only his hasty inference.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was not perfect and had many loopholes.</p><p></p><p>As for the higher-level cultivation methods that do not rely on external things under the new law and principles,</p><p></p><p>cultivators still needed to explore them on their own.</p><p></p><p>Faced with Mr. Bai's selfless teaching of a cultivation path completely contrary to that of the Dharma Transmitting Heavenly Venerate,</p><p></p><p>the attitudes of the cultivators in the world varied.</p><p></p><p>Some were skeptical, some were inexplicably excited, some were pensive, and some were ambitious...</p><p></p><p>The saying goes, all beings have different dispositions.</p><p></p><p>But Mr. Bai didn't mind.</p><p></p><p>After fully imparting everything he had learned,</p><p></p><p>he fell silent.</p><p></p><p>His figure returned to its original size as he looked up at the amber crystal that was about to completely shatter.</p><p></p><p>Facing the possible retaliation from the Dharma Transmitting Heavenly Venerate,</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai's face showed no fear.</p><p></p><p>He was just calm and composed, quietly waiting.</p><p></p><p>At this moment...</p><p></p><p>He suddenly noticed a figure hurrying towards him at a rapid speed.</p><p></p><p>Somewhat old and trembling.</p><p></p><p>But the excitement in his heart was beyond words.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai..."</p><p></p><p>He flew to Mr. Bai's side and called out, unable to contain himself.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the newcomer was very similar to the current Mr. Bai, only his face was full of wrinkles, not knowing how many vicissitudes he had experienced.</p><p></p><p>He carried a black coffin on his back, which looked a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>If Li Fan or Xiao Qing and the others were present,</p><p></p><p>they should be able to recognize at a glance that this old man was none other than Xu Ke from back then.</p><p></p><p>Many years later, seeing the resurrected Mr. Bai again,</p><p></p><p>he should have been overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>But oddly enough...</p><p></p><p>The moment he truly saw the other party, the expression on his face was somewhat startled.</p><p></p><p>Then it turned extremely crestfallen: "You are not Mr. Bai..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke said in a somewhat dazed manner.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai" looked at the old man in front of him who was almost identical to himself, and gently patted his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, I am not him."</p><p></p><p>"The deceased is gone; how could someone who has completely perished be so easily resurrected?"</p><p></p><p>"I am merely the imprint, the trace he left in this world."</p><p></p><p>"In the words of you cultivators,"</p><p></p><p>"It is also called..."</p><p></p><p>"'The Soul of Heaven and Earth'."</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>This chapter was too difficult to write. I persisted in writing it until past two o'clock.</p>

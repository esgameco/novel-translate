        <h1>Chapter 1238</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>Sun and Wang came together with Qing and Hong. For a moment, Xu Ke thought they were his descendants.</p><p></p><p>However, he quickly realized that was not the case.</p><p></p><p>Given the lack of spiritual energy in the small imperial world, it was impossible for cultivators of such high realms to be born here.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke's deep gaze fell upon the two of them.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang cupped his hands respectfully and said, "Under our master's orders, we have come to request an audience with you, senior."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke was somewhat surprised. </p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that there were still people in this world who remembered him.</p><p></p><p>After Qing and Hong telepathically conveyed the recent events in the empire, Xu Ke's expression grew even more solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Who knows of me and has such capabilities? Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>Vague figures flashed through his mind, but he eliminated them one by one.</p><p></p><p>Imperceptibly glancing at the decayed wooden coffin behind him, Xu Ke originally wanted to refuse their invitation.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke's gaze lingered on Qing and Hong for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then he sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>They already knew his location, yet still brought Qing and Hong along to come here. The threatening implication was clear without being stated. Although he had avoided them for a thousand years, it was out of necessity. How could Xu Ke be a heartless and unrighteous person who would stand by and watch them face danger?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Ke shook his head slightly, "I can go with you. But I have a few requests."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang quickly said, "Please speak, senior, it's no problem."</p><p></p><p>"First, one of you two must take my place and sit atop this mountain peak. Before I return, no matter what happens, you cannot leave early. To prevent any unforeseen circumstances, I will set up a restriction." Xu Ke said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Hearing this strange request, Sun Erlang hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"No problem. I will take senior's place and sit here." However, Wang Xuanba patted his chest and agreed.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang knew that after cultivating the techniques passed down by their master, his brother could transform into myriad forms like a strange beast. Even if this body was completely destroyed, it wouldn't have much of an impact. He didn't stop him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke nodded and continued, "Second, after I leave this small world with you, no one is allowed to approach within ten zhang. Otherwise, don't blame me for not giving any leeway."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke glanced at Qing and Hong, emphasizing his words.</p><p></p><p>It seemed this "anyone" included Qing and Hong as well.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's heart trembled upon hearing this, but he still nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"As for this last point..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke said to Qing and Hong, "If anything seems off about me, kill me. Don't hesitate in the slightest."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, a small wooden sword no larger than a palm appeared in Xu Ke's hand.</p><p></p><p>Qing was completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>But seeing Xu Ke's aged yet extremely resolute face, looking just like when he insisted on leaving the empire back then,</p><p></p><p>With tears glimmering in her eyes, Qing didn't say anything more and softly agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Qing tightly gripped the wooden sword in her palm while carefully listening to Xu Ke's telepathic instructions on how to use it.</p><p></p><p>Once everything was settled, Xu Ke looked at Sun Erlang and Wang Xuanba.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Ke's solemnity, Sun Erlang and Wang Xuanba didn't dare be negligent, "Senior, do you have any other orders?"</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment, move further away."</p><p></p><p>The two men and two beasts were puzzled. Exchanging glances, they still obediently flew far away from the abrupt stone mountain where Xu Ke was.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke pressed his right hand on the mountain peak and exerted some force.</p><p></p><p>The stone mountain, heaven and earth, and even the entire world instantly shook slightly.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like sharp, resentful cursing sounds rang out, but it might have been an illusion.</p><p></p><p>After the tremors disappeared, this small world seemed somewhat different from before.</p><p></p><p>But Sun Erlang and the others couldn't tell what the specific difference was.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke slowly stood up, looked at Wang Xuanba, and stamped his right foot.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba signaled Sun Erlang not to worry, then flew over to Xu Ke's side.</p><p></p><p>"Sit down."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke moved his foot away, revealing a deeply sunken area on the mountain peak's surface.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba sat down.</p><p></p><p>"It might hurt a bit, but you won't die."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke flew into the air at this time and said slowly.</p><p></p><p>The instant he flew out of range of that towering stone mountain, Wang Xuanba let out a miserable scream.</p><p></p><p>It was as if some heavy object had suddenly pressed down on him. Caught off guard, his spine was directly compressed, sticking to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The sound of bones being continuously crushed and ground kept ringing out.</p><p></p><p>"I... I'm fine!" A hand stretched out from the body that had nearly been flattened into a meat patty.</p><p></p><p>It waved weakly at Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>"It's just... indeed a bit painful."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke pointed lightly at Wang Xuanba, "Let's go. I said he won't die."</p><p></p><p>The pressure on Wang Xuanba seemed to lessen a bit. He managed to lift his head again with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Sun Erlang took a deep breath. Without hesitation, he led the way with Qing and Hong.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke followed closely behind, step by step.</p><p></p><p>Like Qing and Hong, Sun Erlang secretly observed Xu Ke behind him.</p><p></p><p>Originally, when Xu Ke was sitting, the seemingly decayed coffin behind him didn't stand out much.</p><p></p><p>But Sun Erlang wasn't sure if it was his misconception. Ever since leaving the small world, that coffin seemed to become more and more intact.</p><p></p><p>Its shape was also slowly growing larger.</p><p></p><p>As if...</p><p></p><p>Something would crawl out of it at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the three strange requests Xu Ke had insisted on earlier, a sense of unease arose in Sun Erlang's heart.</p><p></p><p>Low, inexplicable murmuring sounds also transmitted into his ears.</p><p></p><p>Just as Sun Erlang couldn't help but listen, a cold chill suddenly arose from his heart on its own.</p><p></p><p>The noise in his ears instantly vanished, replaced by Xu Ke's low reminder.</p><p></p><p>"Don't pay attention to those strange sounds."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang broke out in a cold sweat from fright.</p><p></p><p>He prided himself on not being a weak-willed person. Moreover, he had experienced another real lifetime in the Taiyi Sect's Huadao Stone simulated world.</p><p></p><p>However, facing those sinister sounds, his experience of several hundred years was so vulnerable. He nearly succumbed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"If not for Master personally imparting the Immortal Heart Mantra, I'm afraid I would have suffered."</p><p></p><p>"This Xu Ke..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang didn't dare look at Xu Ke or the coffin behind him again. He focused and quickened his pace.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>This time, the one letting out a doubtful sound was Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang looked back and saw that for some unknown reason, the coffin behind Xu Ke had once again become decayed and smaller.</p><p></p><p>It was almost no different from the world Xu Ke was originally in.</p><p></p><p>Having received advance notice, all the citizens of the Holy Capital returned home.</p><p></p><p>The vast city was empty, with only-</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The straight and empty path that was opened up for Xu Ke led directly to the Holy Emperor's Seat.</p><p></p><p>"The Venerable Master is already waiting for you, Senior." Sun Erlang said respectfully. </p><p></p><p>There was no longer any need to lead the way.</p><p></p><p>Ever since arriving here, Xu Ke had already sensed that ubiquitous and powerful aura, like the great sun in the sky enveloping the entire small world.</p><p></p><p>It far surpassed the ordinary meaning of the Unified Dao Realm. </p><p></p><p>It even had a certain degree of suppression over the sealed Xuanhuang evil thoughts in the coffin behind him.</p><p></p><p>What made Xu Ke even more incredulous was that he actually sensed a faint familiarity from this aura.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Ke's heart held three parts doubt, three parts unease, and a bit of excitement that no one else knew about.</p><p></p><p>He finally entered the Holy Emperor's Seat.</p><p></p><p>After seeing clearly the figure sitting above, Xu Ke let out a sigh of relief in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a few traces of disappointment flashed by.</p><p></p><p>"I was overthinking it. How could it possibly be Mr. Bai who has already passed away."</p><p></p><p>Forcibly suppressing the distracting thoughts in his mind, Xu Ke concentrated on observing this legendary Great Enlightenment [Faceless Holy Emperor].</p><p></p><p>Or in other words, the Holy Emperor of Heavenly Mandate.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Li Ping was also observing Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>And the coffin behind Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Li Ping saw more than what Sun Erlang saw.</p><p></p><p>The figure had the most handsome appearance in the world, yet it was matched with an expression full of resentment and evil.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping sensed that the urging of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao had descended once again.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was becoming more and more intense.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, it seemed that pale Xuanhuang evil thought also sensed something.</p><p></p><p>It abruptly raised its head and stared fixedly at Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>The corresponding manifestation was that the coffin behind Xu Ke began to shake violently and tremendously.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the sound of huge knocking continuously reverberated inside the tall holy temple.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke suddenly became alert.</p><p></p><p>His figure retreated explosively, and a phantom of a spinning wheel appeared above his head.</p><p></p><p>The golden spinning wheel rotated at high speed, and the images and roars of billions of fierce beasts emerged from within.</p><p></p><p>Trying to suppress the shaking coffin.</p><p></p><p>But the struggle of the Xuanhuang evil thought was unprecedentedly fierce.</p><p></p><p>Until Holy Emperor Li Ping's heart moved, and the [Heaven, Earth, Myriad Spirits, All Living Beings Refining Divinity] of the Great Enlightenment small world operated slightly, obscuring the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao. Only then did the Xuanhuang evil thought that had lost its connection with its other half gradually quiet down.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, Xu Ke, who had tried for a while and discovered that no matter what he did he couldn't fly out, also gave up the futile action.</p><p></p><p>He coldly stared at Li Ping: "Who exactly are you?"</p><p></p><p>At this point, how could Xu Ke still not be clear that this Holy Emperor had come for none other than that sealed Xuanhuang evil thought.</p><p></p><p>"Who I am..." </p><p></p><p>Li Ping paused slightly: "That's actually not important. What's important is that it's time to return things to their rightful owner."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke's complexion changed drastically: "Return things to their rightful owner?"</p><p></p><p>"Back then, Mr. Bai betrayed the Heavenly Dao's entrustment and even sealed away a portion of the Heavenly Dao's power. Now, I will set things right and return the Dao to the Heavens." Although Li Ping's voice wasn't loud, it reverberated endlessly in the Holy Emperor's Seat.</p><p></p><p>Falling into Xu Ke's ears, it was even more like a shocking thunderclap.</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?!"</p><p></p><p>Having lived for so long and having seen many strange things in the past, Xu Ke had never been this shocked before.</p><p></p><p>"How much longer can you persist?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping didn't give Xu Ke any time to react and continuously shook his psyche.</p><p></p><p>Cold sweat dripped from Xu Ke's forehead.</p><p></p><p>"You are..." He asked in slight disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate?"</p><p></p><p>The instant these words were spoken, the air in the Holy Emperor's Seat seemed to freeze.</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, Li Ping actually chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>This answer was clearly somewhat beyond Xu Ke's expectations, and he instantly fell into confusion.</p><p></p><p>"After Mr. Bai's betrayal, do you think the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao would still trust cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's tone was inexplicable.</p><p></p><p>"I am not Xuanhuang Heavenly Venerate."</p><p></p><p>"I am the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao."</p><p></p><p>As Li Ping spoke, he stood up thunderously from the Holy Emperor's Seat.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, his figure seemed to enlarge infinitely.</p><p></p><p>Like a giant standing as tall as the heavens, filling Xu Ke's field of vision.</p><p></p><p>And the aura on Li Ping's body, which was already incomparably powerful, erupted and climbed once more.</p><p></p><p>The concealment of the Myriad Spirits Great Formation disappeared, and Li Ping borrowed the power of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>And for the sake of its other sealed half, the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao was unprecedentedly generous this time.</p><p></p><p>A crack faintly appeared in the sky above the Great Enlightenment small world.</p><p></p><p>That was a sign that the entire world had already been stretched to its limit.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that in recent years, under Li Ping's management, the Great Enlightenment had been upgraded quite a bit and its upper limit far surpassed ordinary small worlds.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it would have been directly blown apart by this.</p><p></p><p>Although it seemed that in front of the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate and Immortal Ruins True Immortal, the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao had no power to fight back.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, compared to when it was intact in the beginning, was actually not much weaker.</p><p></p><p>Strength and weakness are relative.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in Xu Ke's eyes, he seemed to see once again that graceful figure from back then, whose every action carried the will and rhythm of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Favored by Heaven and Earth, bestowing everything upon him.</p><p></p><p>But what was different was that Mr. Bai was gentle and refined.</p><p></p><p>While the figure before his eyes...</p><p></p><p>Domineering and majestic.</p><p></p><p>Causing people to feel awe and submission.</p><p></p><p>In a daze, Xu Ke recalled Mr. Bai's instructions from back then.</p><p></p><p>"On the matter of whether to leave or not, my opinion differs from this consciousness."</p><p></p><p>"I don't think I'm wrong, and I also don't think this is a betrayal."</p><p></p><p>"I'm merely looking for a better way to save the world."</p><p></p><p>"Xu Ke, if possible, help me watch over it."</p><p></p><p>"I think that one day, it will understand."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At that time, Xu Ke didn't understand Mr. Bai's words.</p><p></p><p>In these several thousand years, the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao consciousness separated by Mr. Bai not only didn't come to an understanding but instead developed in an increasingly extreme direction.</p><p></p><p>Not only did the conveyed thoughts and curses become more and more malicious.</p><p></p><p>It would even influence any existence that approached it.</p><p></p><p>The small world where Xu Ke was located, which was used to seal the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao consciousness, slowly lost its vitality and completely turned into a desolate desert.</p><p></p><p>And his body also aged more than normal.</p><p></p><p>Just before this day, Xu Ke still thought that he would ultimately meet the fate of being devoured by the evil thoughts.</p><p></p><p>But he never expected...</p><p></p><p>"This is what Mr. Bai meant by coming to an understanding?"</p><p></p><p>"It's merely the other, original body's understanding."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke couldn't help but think this way.</p><p></p><p>"Hand it over to me."</p><p></p><p>Just as Xu Ke's thoughts were turning, Li Ping spoke again.</p><p></p><p>This startled Xu Ke out of his contemplation.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but take a step back, and the golden spinning wheel still suppressed the decayed wooden coffin.</p>

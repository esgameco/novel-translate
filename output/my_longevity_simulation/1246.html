            <p>Chapter 1244: Life and Death Undetermined</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the identity of being from the same race is really useful. I didn't expect that with just a casual mention, it would agree on the spot." </p><p></p><p>"What?" Upon hearing Lin Ling's answer, Wang Xuanba's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>"Forming an alliance with that old thing? Junior Sister, are you serious?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Tree of Earth Veins bowed respectfully before them, which made Wang Xuanba feel somewhat disdainful.</p><p></p><p>"It's just words to deceive it. An alliance..."</p><p></p><p>"As if it's worthy!" Lin Ling's tone was calm, but the deep disdain in her words was evident.</p><p></p><p>"Now that it has joined the Holy Dynasty, could it possibly go back on its word? If it dares to bring this up in front of me..." Lin Ling snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He had always placed some importance on promises, so he found it a bit hard to accept Lin Ling's blatant disregard for her word.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lin Ling's expression thawed and she smiled, "Senior Brother, all's fair in war."</p><p></p><p>"When dealing with enemies, if you always keep your word and act accordingly, wouldn't that be a sickness?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba was at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>"Besides, Senior Brother, do you still remember Master's instructions before we went to see the Ancient Tree of Earth Veins?" Lin Ling asked again.</p><p></p><p>"Of course I remember. Master said that if the Ancient Tree is stubborn and unreasonable, Junior Sister can replace it." Wang Xuanba recalled and said.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancient Tree of Earth Veins, what a domineering name. Originally, I had some expectations, but after seeing its appearance with my own eyes, I was left with only disappointment." Lin Ling's answer surprised Wang Xuanba.</p><p></p><p>"Weak, too weak. The Ancient Tree of Earth Veins, its greatest strength is that its body is one with the earth veins of the Yellow Realm, able to utilize the power of earth veins flowing throughout the land. This is its characteristic and also its advantage, but it also determines the upper limit of the Earth Vein Tree. Moreover, the body of the Ancient Tree is too large, in the eyes of true experts, it's full of flaws." Lin Ling shook her head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"My dream is to become someone like Master. If I really became that so-called Earth Vein Tree, although my strength would indeed soar in a short time, my future prospects would be completely cut off. I'm not stupid."</p><p></p><p>"I can only deceive that old thing and continue to be on guard."</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling rolled her eyes at Wang Xuanba, "Senior Brother, what kind of person do you think I am?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba gradually came to his senses and apologized on the spot, somewhat embarrassed, "I underestimated Junior Sister."</p><p></p><p>He looked back at the Ancient Tree of Earth Veins on the Holy Emperor's throne and nodded in agreement, "The ancient beings of the Yellow Realm are indeed powerful. But they only borrow the power of the laws of the Yellow Realm's Dao. If the Yellow Realm's Dao is strong, they naturally rise with the tide. But if it's like today, with the Yellow Realm's Dao being trampled underfoot by people like the Dharma Transmitter, they can only struggle to survive and hide in dark corners, reminiscing about their past glory."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect Senior Brother to be a cultured person, talking in such a sophisticated manner." Lin Ling wasn't sure if she was sincerely praising him or taking a little revenge with sarcasm.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't think that much, I just simply want to become stronger."</p><p></p><p>"Enough talk, I'm going to cultivate. After swallowing some of that old thing's body this time, I indeed gained something. If I had known earlier, I should have been more ruthless and swallowed more." Lin Ling's voice echoed in Wang Xuanba's ears with a hint of regret.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, her figure slowly faded and her aura disappeared along with it.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba smiled wryly, mocking himself for overthinking.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yellow Realm, Tianyu Province.</p><p></p><p>A famous wonder of an immortal alliance.</p><p></p><p>Even without getting close, one could vaguely feel the endless cold intent emanating from the crevice.</p><p></p><p>The closer to the crevice, the more rapidly the temperature dropped.</p><p></p><p>Even Golden Core cultivators found it difficult to endure the low temperature here for a long time and could not linger.</p><p></p><p>At the bottom of the deep crevice, blue light would occasionally erupt.</p><p></p><p>It was the freezing qi.</p><p></p><p>But if one stood beside the crevice and looked down,</p><p></p><p>One would see that in this icy abyss, there were actually countless lotus flowers made of flames blooming.</p><p></p><p>They were not cold flames, but truly scorching fire lotuses.</p><p></p><p>Cold and heat, completely contradictory, yet intertwined with each other, simultaneously present in this icy abyss.</p><p></p><p>The figure of Li Ping, the Faceless Holy Emperor of the Great Enlightenment, suddenly appeared outside this wondrous scene of the Icy Abyss Fire Lotus.</p><p></p><p>Just like the countless tourists who came to this place, he stood still and gazed downward.</p><p></p><p>"The land is spiritually nourishing, the creation is mysterious and wonderful."</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Li Ping couldn't help but sigh in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, the scene here was actually quite different from what ordinary cultivators saw.</p><p></p><p>The blue icy abyss actually exuded a deep aura of death.</p><p></p><p>Pitch black, suffocating.</p><p></p><p>But those scorching red fire lotuses were pure white, emanating a vigorous vitality.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that cold and heat were intertwined here, but in fact it was...</p><p></p><p>"Black abyss, white flowers; death abyss, life flowers."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping stepped forward, one foot stepping into the void, his figure rapidly falling into the black abyss.</p><p></p><p>However, his disappearance did not cause any notice from the surrounding cultivators.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, from Li Ping's perspective, the surrounding scenery suddenly stretched and distorted.</p><p></p><p>Although the white flowers of life seemed not far away, Li Ping had been falling for a long time, yet the distance between him and them did not seem to get any closer.</p><p></p><p>The entire space of the black abyss expanded and extended endlessly with Li Ping's descent.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the surrounding death qi trying to infect him, Li Ping sneered inwardly, but didn't pay too much attention to it.</p><p></p><p>If it were an ordinary cultivator, even at the Harmonious Dao realm, their lifespan would be greatly reduced under the invasion of this black death qi.</p><p></p><p>But Li Ping was the embodiment of the Yellow Realm's Dao, a part of the Yellow Realm's laws, even if it was an out-of-control part, how could it harm him?</p><p></p><p>Ever since forcibly devouring the Yellow Realm's evil thoughts, Li Ping indeed felt that the Yellow Realm's Dao seemed to have become somewhat distant.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Ping was certain that this was just an instinctive reaction of the Dao after devouring the evil thoughts.</p><p></p><p>After some more time passed, the bond between him and the Yellow Realm's Dao would eventually return to normal.</p><p></p><p>Although currently in a weak period of their relationship, it was not something that the death qi here could shake.</p><p></p><p>As expected, even though Holy Emperor Li Ping did not take any protective measures, like being immune to all laws, the black death qi only surrounded him in layers.</p><p></p><p>But it couldn't find any breakthrough at all.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's gaze pierced through the thick death qi and looked straight at the flowers of life below.</p><p></p><p>"At the boundary of life and death, the source of all spirits."</p><p></p><p>"The Yellow Realm has become like this, yet it only hides in this secret place, struggling to survive..."</p><p></p><p>"What use are you!"</p><p></p><p>A murderous intent suddenly arose from Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Forcibly pushing back the surrounding death qi.</p><p></p><p>"Get out of my way!"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping let out a low shout, and the layers of death qi below him actually parted, opening up a passage.</p><p></p><p>Space no longer extended, Li Ping's figure flew, instantly...</p><p></p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The dense vitality rushed forth, with the white flowers of life close at hand.</p><p></p><p>The black clouds of death hovered overhead, lingering for a long time without dispersing.</p><p></p><p>Faced with that rich vitality, Li Ping suddenly felt a sense of solemnity in his heart. </p><p></p><p>Compared to pure death energy, a large amount of useless life force was more like a deadly poison.</p><p></p><p>Because life force is inherently a beneficial state.</p><p></p><p>As the embodiment of the Dao, Li Ping could naturally enjoy this favor from heaven and earth. </p><p></p><p>The life force accumulated over thousands of years beside the black abyss and white flowers seemed to have finally found an outlet, madly surging towards Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Even though he intentionally tried to block it, he was no match for the overabundance of life force here.</p><p></p><p>Inevitably, some of it still poured into Li Ping's body.</p><p></p><p>Life force does bring certain benefits. </p><p></p><p>But Li Ping was not a pure Eternal Realm cultivator who relied solely on his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The essence of Source Power, the destiny of the Holy Dynasty, the blessing of the Dao...</p><p></p><p>It was the combination of various forces that created his current strength comparable to the Eternal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's current state had long reached a balance after his advancement. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, that balance was slowly being broken by the continuous influx of endless life force.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's hair grew wildly as if it had come alive.</p><p></p><p>In just an instant, it had already extended to his ankles. </p><p></p><p>His body also expanded simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>One zhang, two zhang... (1 zhang ≈ 3.3 meters)</p><p></p><p>Amidst the creaking sounds of his bones, Li Ping turned into a three-zhang giant in just a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>It made him look more majestic, but for the current Li Ping, it was not a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Frowning slightly, he tried his best to transform and absorb the surging life force. </p><p></p><p>But the speed of shrinking was far from the speed of growing.</p><p></p><p>While maintaining the balance of various forces in his body, Li Ping observed his surroundings, searching for a way to enter the place where Ruo Mu was hiding.</p><p></p><p>After devouring the evil thoughts of Xuanhuang, there was little left in the Xuanhuang Realm that could escape his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Even if some memories of the evil thoughts had become blurry, as long as he saw it with his own eyes, he would definitely be able to sense it again quickly.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, Holy Emperor Li Ping disappeared at the bottom of the black abyss.</p><p></p><p>Without a target to pour into, the life force suddenly became a bit disoriented. The white flowers swayed slightly, having no choice but to absorb the life force back.</p><p></p><p>A world filled with an eerie aura, like faded yellow leaves.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's nearly five-zhang tall body suddenly appeared in it. </p><p></p><p>But in this strange environment, it seemed unable to propagate at all.</p><p></p><p>It quickly turned into a withered yellow entity and floated down from the air like autumn leaves.</p><p></p><p>Having found a way to vent the unwanted life force, Li Ping gradually expelled the culprit that caused the imbalance from his body.</p><p></p><p>His body size slowly shrank.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the changes in the balance within his body during this short period of time, some details did not revert along with it and instead became a part of his physical characteristics.</p><p></p><p>For example, his height remained at three zhang and three, his jet-black hair hung to his waist.</p><p></p><p>His physique also became fuller, with explosive power hidden beneath his golden robes.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping did not pay much attention to these changes.</p><p></p><p>It was just an external appearance. As long as he wanted, he could change back to his original appearance at any time.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his attention was focused on this eerie place.</p><p></p><p>The decaying smell flowing here even made him a bit uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>What concerned him more was the center of this place.</p><p></p><p>A towering ancient tree, its entire body yellow and full of spots, stood silently.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's three-zhang tall giant was no more than an ant at the foot of the giant tree.</p><p></p><p>On the withered yellow branches, countless cultivators hung densely.</p><p></p><p>Like a tree full of fruits.</p><p></p><p>They all had their eyes closed, with strange and satisfied expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>As Li Ping's gaze swept over, he did not find any other figures besides this withered ancient tree.</p><p></p><p>"Only the main body is here..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping knew that Ruo Mu also had an avatar that often went out to lure cultivators here, turning them into golden core fruits to vent his inner resentment.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it seemed to have gone out.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping was not in a hurry and continued to carefully observe the space here.</p><p></p><p>On the towering tree trunk, some deep marks could be vaguely seen. As if it had suffered some fatal injury.</p><p></p><p>But perhaps because it was invaded by the withered yellow, Li Ping's call did not receive any response at all.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it triggered the ancient tree's spontaneous defense.</p><p></p><p>Bits and pieces of withered yellow began to corrode from the ground beneath Li Ping's feet, following the veins of the giant tree.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping intentionally released his defense and absorbed a strand of the withered yellow into his body.</p><p></p><p>He wrapped it with golden Source Power essence to prevent it from spreading, then carefully observed it.</p><p></p><p>Although the power of the withered yellow was strange, it could not break the seal of the Source Power essence.</p><p></p><p>From this withered yellow power, Li Ping sensed not only aging in the ordinary sense.</p><p></p><p>He also sensed the decay of the entire world.</p><p></p><p>As if the sky was about to collapse, the decline was fully displayed and irreversible.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"The world is heading towards ruin."</p><p></p><p>Countless scenes appeared in his mind, depicting the various states of the Xuanhuang Realm, where numerous disasters descended due to the decay of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>But Li Ping knew that in reality, these states of the Xuanhuang Realm did not experience these events that should have happened.</p><p></p><p>"Ruo Mu is the source of all living beings in the Xuanhuang Realm. To a certain extent, it indeed reflects the state of vitality in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Ruo Mu has now turned into this appearance, yet the Xuanhuang Realm still appears to be full of vitality..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>He quickly knew the answer.</p><p></p><p>"If there was no injection of external life force, the Xuanhuang Realm would definitely decay in sync with Ruo Mu."</p><p></p><p>"The source of this life force is..."</p><p></p><p>"The remnants of other cultivation worlds that were devoured."</p><p></p><p>"Although they were dismembered, during the process of fusion, the remaining life force from those cultivation world remnants was also absorbed."</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang was thus reborn..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"This operation is indeed exquisite beyond compare."</p><p></p><p>As the embodiment of the Dao and the nominal victim, after realizing what had happened over these thousands of years, he couldn't help but express his heartfelt admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Life and death are impermanent. Death and life are impermanent."</p><p></p><p>"This old man was originally an existence that controlled life and death, yet now I have fallen into this state."</p><p></p><p>"The world wants to abandon me, how can I not hate it..."</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Ping was pondering, a strange voice suddenly sounded behind him, disappearing without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping knew that the owner of the voice was none other than Ruo Mu.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

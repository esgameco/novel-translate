        <h1>Chapter 549</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the midst of his restless emotions, he spent about ten days and finally completed the collection of one hundred million contribution points.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, following Gao Yuan's instructions, he quietly awaited Li Fan's next order.</p><p></p><p>This period of time was quite difficult to endure.</p><p></p><p>Although it sounded reasonable, it was just Gao Yuan's personal speculation.</p><p></p><p>As for what the Master Envoy was really thinking...</p><p></p><p>Who could really say for sure?</p><p></p><p>Maybe he had plans to have me, He Zhenghao, manage the one hundred million contributions?</p><p></p><p>Although He Zhenghao remained outwardly calm on the surface.</p><p></p><p>In reality, his mind was in turmoil, and he was extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>It felt as if he were a death row prisoner awaiting his fate on the execution ground as time passed by, in agonizing anticipation of his ultimate destiny.</p><p></p><p>It truly gave him a taste of what the ancient cultivators referred to as 'the invasion of the heart devil'.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, He Zhenghao's luck was not bad.</p><p></p><p>Just when he thought he was about to give up, he suddenly felt inexplicable fluctuations coming from his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Excited, He Zhenghao hurriedly composed himself and then eagerly took out the small metal figurine.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, do you need me for something?" Placing the figurine on the table, He Zhenghao respectfully asked.</p><p></p><p>"Use the one hundred million contribution points you collected to quickly purchase the materials listed here," Li Fan's voice came from the metal statue.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't have to be purchased from Heaven Mirroring Pavilion. You can also consider prioritizing items with slightly flawed quality but much lower prices."</p><p></p><p>"After some time, when the prices of these items go up, you can sell them off."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After instructing He Zhenghao, Li Fan's voice gradually faded away.</p><p></p><p>But in He Zhenghao's mind at that moment, it was like a blank slate, thundering.</p><p></p><p>"Gao Yuan was wrong!"</p><p></p><p>"This time, the Master Envoy really intends to entrust me with operating this one hundred million contribution!"</p><p></p><p>After a brief moment of stagnant thinking, He Zhenghao slowly recovered.</p><p></p><p>However, this time, he no longer felt the previous fear and helplessness.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he felt a strange excitement and passion.</p><p></p><p>Although relying solely on his own abilities would undoubtedly be inadequate.</p><p></p><p>But if guided by the Master, then it would be a different story!</p><p></p><p>Investment, to put it simply, was actually quite simple.</p><p></p><p>It was all about having an information advantage.</p><p></p><p>As long as you knew something others didn't, even an ignorant person could make money lying down!</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's body trembled slightly as he quickly read through the list provided by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Tianyu Dan, Violent Qi Powder, Madness Suppressing Dan..."</p><p></p><p>"Standard Heavenly Gang Armor, Divine Martial Thunder..."</p><p></p><p>"Hundred Battle Formation Diagram..."</p><p></p><p>The more He Zhenghao read, the more furrowed his brow became, full of confusion.</p><p></p><p>It was completely different from what he had expected.</p><p></p><p>He originally thought that Li Fan's procurement of materials would be rare ores, spiritual woods, or similar raw materials.</p><p></p><p>Because with the full control of the Heaven Mirroring Pavilion, the price fluctuations of these items wouldn't be too significant.</p><p></p><p>They would generally fluctuate by at most twenty percent.</p><p></p><p>Even if unlucky enough to buy at the highest point, as long as held for a sufficient amount of time, one could reach the peak again.</p><p></p><p>When it was then sold, at most it would incur some handling fees.</p><p></p><p>If the merit level was high enough, the losses from handling fees could be negligible.</p><p></p><p>But all the items listed on Li Fan's instructions were finished products.</p><p></p><p>And...</p><p></p><p>They were all items used in combat such as pills, artifacts, and formation diagrams.</p><p></p><p>Pills were understandable since cultivators exploring sect ruins were likely to encounter dangers. Carrying them for emergencies was reasonable.</p><p></p><p>However, artifacts like Heavenly Gang Armor and Divine Martial Thunder were not commonly useful to ordinary cultivators unless they were in life or death battles.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao checked the trading records of these items in the market and found them to be very few.</p><p></p><p>They were basically unsought after.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, their prices remained stable, and since they could be mass-produced, it was likely that there was a large inventory.</p><p></p><p>Would the prices of these items rise?</p><p></p><p>Even though Li Fan had previously demonstrated his incredible predictive ability, He Zhenghao couldn't help but fall into deep doubt at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Do we really need to buy these items in large quantities?</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao hesitated.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Gao Yuan's admonition resounded in his mind again.</p><p></p><p>"As subordinates, we may not have the ability, but the most crucial thing is to be obedient enough."</p><p></p><p>"Whatever the Master asks us to do, we must complete it resolutely and swiftly, without dragging our feet."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, with so many cultivators in the Congyun Sea, and none of us being prodigies, why would the Master favor us?"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao gritted his teeth and made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Although I don't quite understand, I'll just follow the Master's instructions."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, these pills, artifacts have a wide reach. Whenever someone mentions something affordable and useful, they will immediately think of them."</p><p></p><p>"Even if the Master's prediction fails, it's unlikely to cause much loss."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao reassured himself.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, the focused He Zhenghao dared not be negligent and quickly sought advice from his friends.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was now in high demand.</p><p></p><p>When it was known that he needed help, many cultivators eagerly offered suggestions.</p><p></p><p>After contacting and comparing prices from over a dozen suppliers, He Zhenghao began his procurement business.</p><p></p><p>With major customers coming in to purchase products with accumulated inventory, they naturally smiled broadly. To facilitate quick transactions and prevent the other party from backing out, they offered very favorable prices.</p><p></p><p>Although he had a lot of one hundred million contribution points, when divided among the varieties of pills and artifacts, there weren't many points left.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the progress of the procurement being achieved so rapidly was beyond He Zhenghao's expectations.</p><p></p><p>After spending all the one hundred million contribution points he had raised and receiving a pile of seemingly useless "junk" in return as per Li Fan's orders, He Zhenghao felt a bit empty in his heart.</p><p></p><p>A sense of unreality lingered in his mind, not dissipating for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Despite He Zhenghao being cautious, his actions couldn't escape the attention of some people.</p><p></p><p>In the public eye, He Zhenghao's every move not only represented himself.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew that he was a trusted aide of Li Fan. Such a large-scale procurement, without Li Fan's consent, would be suspicious.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this ancient cultivator of Tianshi Zong had foreseen something once again?</p><p></p><p>Would the prices of the materials He Zhenghao procured rise?</p><p></p><p>Many people were tempted in an instant.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>With the bitter experience of the past as a lesson, more cultivators became wise, believing it was likely that Li Fan was deliberately inflating the prices once again.</p><p></p><p>So, they chose to wait and see.</p>

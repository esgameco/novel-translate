            <p>In conversing with his mother Lù Xīchán, Li Fan sensed subtle changes from her indifferent expression when she mentioned matters related to Tianlingzhou.</p><p></p><p>In the past, every time Chief Lù revealed such an expression, it meant that a bloody storm was about to unfold.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Wanxian Alliance is going to act so quickly?" Li Fan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>If that was true, it seemed a bit too urgent.</p><p></p><p>After the completion of the Chain Spirit Formation, there was no need to pretend or reward anyone, right?</p><p></p><p>Or could there be some hidden situation?</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, I cannot go to Tianlingzhou."</p><p></p><p>"Judging from the might seen in the Five Elements Paradise back then, the power of the Chain Spirit Formation might surpass that of the He Dao."</p><p></p><p>"With the situation unclear, risking one's life is not wise."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, there is no need for me to personally intervene to figure out what will happen in Tianlingzhou."</p><p></p><p>A faint glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes as he crouched down and waited in this transmission square.</p><p></p><p>This was the necessary transfer point on the way to Tianlingzhou.</p><p></p><p>Most of the array masters who received the invitations should pass through here.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, not long after, Li Fan saw a suitable target in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Lè Rán, a Golden Dan array master, was one of the participants in the Chain Spirit Formation competition this time.</p><p></p><p>Unaware of the hidden Li Fan, Lè Rán hastily activated the teleportation array, intending to head to the destination.</p><p></p><p>Before he left, the aura of no escape had quietly locked onto him. [Book recommendation site]</p><p></p><p>Maintaining a distance that could maintain the aura of no escape, Li Fan secretly followed.</p><p></p><p>After a half day's journey, Lè Rán arrived at the location of Tianlingzhou.</p><p></p><p>From afar, a giant Dust Ferryboat was suspended in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators flew towards it from all directions.</p><p></p><p>Lè Rán's face was excited as he flew over and soon reached the Dust Ferryboat.</p><p></p><p>Holding a black and gold invitation card, a stream of light swept over him.</p><p></p><p>Lè Rán was able to pass through the protective light barrier and land on the Dust Ferryboat.</p><p></p><p>"Lè, my friend!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he landed, a familiar person greeted him.</p><p></p><p>Lè Rán responded one by one.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators had already gathered on the boat.</p><p></p><p>They were all familiar faces.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the participants in the array competition, many frontline constructors and assistants who had contributed greatly to the popularization of the Tianxuan Chain Spirit Formation were invited to this Dust Ferryboat.</p><p></p><p>Gathered together, the atmosphere was lively and warm.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianxuan Chain Spirit Formation is complete. Facing the fierce attack of the Five Elders, its power will be fully displayed. Chief Lù invited us to come and witness it, truly a lucky event for us."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, finally able to witness the might of the Chain Spirit Formation, after years of hard work."</p><p></p><p>"I just wonder, would the elders of the Five Elders Association be afraid to come directly? Wouldn't all our preparations be in vain then?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, rest assured. Knowing the Five Elders Association as I do, they probably still think we are just showing off as before. Little do they know..."</p><p></p><p>"Be cautious, my friend, be cautious!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Amidst the cheerful atmosphere, everyone awaited the arrival of the Five Elders Association cultivators. [Book recommendation site]</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until ten days later that the target finally arrived.</p><p></p><p>Without any signs, a beam of white light descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Shining near the border of Tianlingzhou.</p><p></p><p>Locking onto a hidden cultivator who was moving rapidly.</p><p></p><p>"So this is your Wanxian Alliance's Tianxuan Chain Spirit Formation? Doesn't seem that impressive," he said mockingly.</p><p></p><p>"But being visible alone, what can you do against us?"</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the man remained calm and even stopped, mocking the Dust Ferryboat in the sky.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the people on the Dust Ferryboat were indignant.</p><p></p><p>"How dare a mere Divine Transformation cultivator be so audacious?"</p><p></p><p>"This person dares to take the lead, it shouldn't be that simple."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Seeing the provocation faced by Wanxian Alliance and their lack of action, the people on the Dust Ferryboat burst into commotion.</p><p></p><p>But Wanxian Alliance did not disappoint them.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Chain Spirit Formation in the sky began to move.</p><p></p><p>From the thousands of light pillars that locked onto the Five Elders Association cultivators, sharp golden lights suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Like sharp flying swords, they seemed to be aiming to behead the Five Elders Association cultivators.</p><p></p><p>However, the members of the Five Elders Association remained calm and unfazed.</p><p></p><p>Just as the golden light was about to descend on them.</p><p></p><p>It was forcefully halted, suspended in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>The golden light swelled, emitting unwilling buzzing sounds, attempting to break free from the restraint.</p><p></p><p>But on the battlefield, as if there were invisible giant hands, they were firmly held down.</p><p></p><p>The golden light couldn't move.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>There was a dead silence on the Dust Ferryboat.</p><p></p><p>The young array masters watching the attack of the Chain Spirit Formation being easily blocked all displayed expressions of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators seemed to realize something, their faces suddenly turned pale.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes were filled with panic, looking around.</p><p></p><p>As if they wanted to escape on the spot.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a deep voice resounded on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme One-Heart, please leave."</p><p></p><p>"According to the agreement, you should not appear here."</p><p></p><p>In the midst of the voice, the figure of Jì Hóngdào slowly materialized.</p><p></p><p>Standing before the Five Elders Association cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>The silver-bell-like laughter echoed between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Is there a place under the heavens where I cannot go?"</p><p></p><p>The voice was heard, but the person was not seen.</p><p></p><p>But all the Wanxian Alliance cultivators present showed anxious expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Longevity..."</p><p></p><p>"Supreme One?"</p><p></p><p>The faces of the over a thousand Five Elders Association cultivators remained unchanged, as if they had long known that the Supreme One-Heart would make a move.</p><p></p><p>Their expressions were all the same.</p><p></p><p>Looking ahead coldly.</p><p></p><p>Watching this scene from several states away, Li Fan, relying on the view of the heavens and earth, was shaken to the core.</p><p></p><p>"This voice..."</p>

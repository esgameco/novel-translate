        <h1>Chapter 442</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The same principle, the conclusion Li Fan deduced may not necessarily be absolutely correct.</p><p></p><p>Just like the blind men touching the elephant, what they perceive may not be the whole picture of things.</p><p></p><p>But it is still a part of the truth.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the Dao crystal emitted a deep blue light, instantly recording all the jumbled thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Next, what Li Fan needed to consider was how to deal with the woman in green.</p><p></p><p>Soon after she finished speaking, Li Fan shook his head and replied, "The power of the 'Xianxu' is beyond the imagination of ordinary people."</p><p></p><p>"The existence capable of distorting even time and space brings effects that are difficult to predict."</p><p></p><p>"You said that after cutting off the channel to the Xianjie, you would be able to break free from the shackles and be completely free."</p><p></p><p>"But this is just a theory. What the actual outcome will be, who dares to guarantee?"</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan spoke slowly, he observed the expression of the woman in green without changing his demeanor.</p><p></p><p>"After all, those places that have separated from the Profound Yellow Realm before have all disappeared without a trace and can no longer be contacted."</p><p></p><p>"Are they truly roaming freely, or have they already perished within the Xianxu? Who knows."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, why would our 'Alliance of Ten Realms' be able to attract so many members?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if there is only a one-in-a-million chance of failure, it would still be too great a risk for the entire civilization."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said with a slightly mocking tone.</p><p></p><p>The smile on the woman in green's face gradually faded as she stared at Li Fan, as if trying to discern something from his face.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan remained composed without any flaws.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the woman in green say, "You are right. That is also the reason why I have returned to the Profound Yellow Realm this time."</p><p></p><p>"Currently, within the Empire, the existence of the Xianxu is still known only to a very few. However, there are no walls that can keep everything hidden. Once the conservatives in the Empire learn about it, the resistance to carrying out the plan to leave the Profound Yellow Realm will be even greater."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan interjected, "So, are you here to seek help?"</p><p></p><p>The woman in green nodded, saying, "The determination of the Empress to implement the plan of leaving the Profound Yellow Realm remains unchanged. Even if there are indeed some risks, we believe it is worth it."</p><p></p><p>"However, the detestable nobles within the Empire may not necessarily see it the same way."</p><p></p><p>"To avoid internal strife, the Empire must accelerate the progress of the plan."</p><p></p><p>Pausing for a moment, she continued, "While quickly exchanging for the Integrated Dao Techniques, we also need to accelerate the cultivation of resources for the Rift Boundary Whales…"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she handed over a jade slip.</p><p></p><p>With a sweep of his divine sense, Li Fan discovered a long list of items inside.</p><p></p><p>After searching through his memory, Li Fan realized that although the unit prices of these items were mostly not expensive, the total quantity was quite impressive.</p><p></p><p>In terms of total consumption, it was probably more than the over five million contribution points he had on hand could afford.</p><p></p><p>His brows slightly furrowed, he said, "If you join the 'Alliance of Ten Realms,' these things you mentioned will naturally be considered for assistance by the organization."</p><p></p><p>"However, since you are determined to leave, the Alliance is not a charity."</p><p></p><p>The woman in green said, "Just as you, the messenger, said, leaving the Profound Yellow Realm may possibly lead to destruction."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Empire's resolve remains unchanged, it does not hinder us from making separate arrangements."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes lit up, "Are you saying…"</p><p></p><p>"Exactly, the Empire will mobilize a portion of its forces to join the Alliance of Ten Realms."</p><p></p><p>"As another seed of civilization, they will still remain in the Profound Yellow Realm. If the Empire encounters unforeseen circumstances in the future, they can also serve as a branch to continue the Empire's heritage." The woman in green spoke calmly, her eyes clear and resolute.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could not help but sneer, "Aren't you perhaps overestimating yourselves? Withdrawing only a small amount of force to avoid raising the alert of the Empire's personnel, it is unlikely to be enough to exchange for everything on the list."</p><p></p><p>The woman in green replied calmly, "Perhaps you misunderstand, Messenger. Since we are meant to be a seed of civilization continuing the Empire's legacy, all the technologies the Empire currently possesses will naturally remain. After joining the Alliance, these technologies can also be shared with the organization."</p><p></p><p>"Without going into details, just the value of the 'Beast God Armor' alone, I believe, is worth most of the items on the list."</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, they were boldly using all the technologies they had as bargaining chips.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was likely some discounts would apply to the so-called "all technologies," based on what Li Fan had seen of the Empire in his mind, it was enough to make him intrigued.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, these might not be of much help to Li Fan's cultivation realm.</p><p></p><p>But the power system of the Empire, which was vastly different from the current Profound Yellow Realm, could greatly enhance Li Fan's foundation.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, having many skills does not weigh down the body. Perhaps in some future cycle of reincarnation, the power to control exotic beasts could come in handy.</p><p></p><p>Without much hesitation, just a moment later, Li Fan made his decision.</p><p></p><p>He would deceive the entire array of technologies from the Empire.</p><p></p><p>Putting on a look of inexplicable excitement, Li Fan pondered for a moment before saying, "This is a major matter, and it is not something I can decide on my own."</p><p></p><p>"Let me return and report back before giving a response."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's words were within the woman in green's expectations as well.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan clasped his hands and hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>In the secret room, only the group from the Empire was left.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, are we really using the core technologies that the Empire has developed over so many years as trading chips?" Li Chenfeng asked somewhat unwillingly.</p><p></p><p>The woman in green did not respond immediately but furrowed her brows and looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>After implementing many restrictions in succession, she turned to Li Chenfeng and reprimanded, "Have you forgotten how I taught you?"</p><p></p><p>"Survival is the primary concern for the development of civilization."</p><p></p><p>"Only by staying alive do technologies, culture, and all these things have meaning."</p><p></p><p>"If the civilization itself perishes, even if these things were glorious, what use would they be?"</p><p></p><p>Li Chenfeng still felt dissatisfied, "But…"</p><p></p><p>The woman in green raised her hand to interrupt him, saying, "This matter has already been discussed and decided with the Empress. There is no need to say more!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Chenfeng could only reluctantly bow his head in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"That man just now, I cannot see through him. He is just a messenger, yet it seems that this 'Alliance of Ten Realms' truly has some tricks up their sleeves," the woman in green said softly as she watched Li Fan's departing figure.</p><p></p><p>Li Chenfeng was surprised, "Elder, with your cultivation, can't you see through his background? What realm is that person really at?"</p><p></p><p>The woman in green also looked puzzled, "At first glance, his realm may not be very high, but I can always sense a dangerous aura emanating from him."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 496</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The eloquent gentleman mentioned some place names familiar or unfamiliar to Li Fan. </p><p></p><p>"The reason behind all this is because these places have '通幽隧口' (mysterious passages)." </p><p></p><p>"The essence of '通幽隧口' is still inconclusive. However, based on our research, if it is left exposed, the frequency of strange incidents in that state will increase sharply." </p><p></p><p>"So, it's necessary to suppress it with the '玄天鎖幽陣'." </p><p></p><p>From the words of the first eloquent gentleman, Li Fan received a completely unexpected answer. </p><p></p><p>"When Ten Thousand Immortals Island was still around, we never managed to find this '通幽隧口' at the bottom of the island. We only judged its existence based on the annual reports of anomalies from the '叢雲海天機堂'." </p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought it would be at the bottom of the former preaching place of Forefather Tian?" </p><p></p><p>"Forefather Tian's mighty power, even if there is a trace of residual power left after a thousand years, can still effectively seal off the '通幽隧口'. But now that Ten Thousand Immortals Island is gone, this '通幽隧口' must be sealed." </p><p></p><p>"The existence of anomalies, although not a secret, very few people know that anomalies can also spread. In order to avoid causing panic and to ensure the stability of Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, strict confidentiality is required." </p><p></p><p>The eloquent gentleman said calmly, "All this secrecy, is it because of this?" Li Fan couldn't help but feel puzzled by this somewhat strange request being related to the anomalies prevalent all over the world. </p><p></p><p>"Is it all because of this?" The first eloquent gentleman looked coldly at Li Fan. </p><p></p><p>"Master Li, don't underestimate anomalies. They are not as easy to deal with as one might think." </p><p></p><p>His words had implications but did not elaborate further. </p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan put away the disdain on his face and nodded slightly. </p><p></p><p>Changing the subject, he asked, "Why was I suddenly appointed as the acting island master? This '叢雲海'..." </p><p></p><p>The first eloquent gentleman interrupted Li Fan's questioning and shook his head slowly, "It seems that during ancient times, deceit within the sect was very serious. Master Li is a bit too suspicious." </p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, everything is being done according to regulations." </p><p></p><p>"According to the ancient rules that have been passed down to this day, when the overall structure of a certain region's Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance is destroyed, the highest-ranking cultivator in that region automatically inherits the first executive position." </p><p></p><p>"If there are several cultivators of the same rank, the actual candidate is determined by their combat abilities." </p><p></p><p>"Although Friend Li was able to slay four Nascent Soul-stage beings, even though it was done in the name of external aid. However, these excuses might deceive others, but trying to deceive our Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance is a bit too idealistic." </p><p></p><p>"We have a very thorough and precise assessment of the lethality of each item sold in the celestial mirror. Although it is indeed possible to slay Nascent Soul-stage beings with Golden Core stage cultivation, it is absolutely impossible to leave no trace, clean and neat, like Friend Li did initially." </p><p></p><p>"Among the surviving cultivators of the '叢雲海', Friend has the highest combat power. Who else could be the acting island master if not you?" </p><p></p><p>The first eloquent gentleman looked at Li Fan with a smile that wasn't really a smile, and answered. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt a bit solemn in his heart and his face showed an embarrassed look as if being exposed. </p><p></p><p>"In that case, I seem to have overthought it." </p><p></p><p>"Very well, I will accept this task!" </p><p></p><p>He said calmly. </p><p></p><p>Whether parts of it were true or false, the first eloquent gentleman had spoken to this extent, and if Li Fan didn't agree, he probably wouldn't be able to leave the room. </p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan being sensible, the first eloquent gentleman nodded in satisfaction. </p><p></p><p>"After '叢雲仙城' is built, the blockade around the '叢雲海' will not be lifted until then." </p><p></p><p>"Of course, headquarters will also send out corresponding cultivators to assist you in rebuilding the '叢雲海'. However, due to certain reasons, the number of support cultivators will not be too many. There will only be a small amount of support in areas such as '超距傳送陣'." </p><p></p><p>"The main focus will still be on you." </p><p></p><p>"I will also dispatch a deputy to assist you in the reconstruction of the immortal city." </p><p></p><p>"For the construction materials needed, you can ask him for them." </p><p></p><p>"The list of related materials will be sent to you shortly. What you need to do most is coordinate and supervise the surviving cultivators of '叢雲海' to quickly rebuild the '叢雲城'." </p><p></p><p>... </p><p></p><p>After explaining everything, the first eloquent gentleman let Li Fan leave. </p><p></p><p>Later, a cultivator named Zhou Kebao found Li Fan and brought the approved list of materials. </p><p></p><p>"Master Li, this is the detailed list of materials approved for this project. Please have a look." The chubby Zhou Kebao smiled and said to Li Fan. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan took the list and carefully examined it. </p><p></p><p>The long list of details would take quite some time to go through even roughly. </p><p></p><p>Various known and unknown items made it dizzying to read. </p><p></p><p>They were only labeled with names without specifying their exact uses, making it confusing. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan was a layman in many aspects, but he couldn't escape his eyes when it came to formations. </p><p></p><p>Including the '超距傳送法陣', there were originally 1,687 transmission arrays on the former Ten Thousand Immortals Island. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan searched for the special material for building the transmission arrays, '玄空石', and calculated based on the quantities listed in the list. </p><p></p><p>After a moment, Li Fan indeed discovered something amiss. </p><p></p><p>If only the materials listed on the list were used, the requirements for constructing all the small transmission arrays could not be met, let alone the one required for the '超距傳送法陣'. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face immediately darkened, "Friend Zhou, did you make a mistake with this list? Please double-check it." </p><p></p><p>His eyes emitted naked killing intent, not hiding anything. </p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao was first slightly stunned, then took the list and started to look through it again. </p><p></p><p>While checking, he muttered to himself, "A mistake? That's impossible, right? Could it be that Master Li, you..." </p><p></p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, he heard Li Fan coldly saying, "Friend Zhou, I've issued a military order in front of the first eloquent gentleman." </p><p></p><p>"If the mission cannot be completed as scheduled, the consequences might not be good." </p><p></p><p>"I am a person who holds grudges. I will avenge any grievances!" </p><p></p><p>"If there is really no hope of completing the mission in time by then, I don't mind taking down those who have secretly hindered us together!" </p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and quickly patted his chest, saying, "Master Li, please don't be so agitated. I will carefully check it again!" </p><p></p><p>With that, he didn't dare look at Li Fan anymore and hurriedly left. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly and closed his eyes, waiting. </p><p></p><p>After almost half a day, Zhou Kebao returned with a brand new list. </p><p></p><p>"Heh, Master Li has sharp eyes! It was indeed wrong!" </p><p></p><p>"The previous list was an initial estimate, and compared to the final list, it was indeed missing some materials." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan accepted the new list and found that the quantity of materials on it was significantly more than before, more than half.</p>

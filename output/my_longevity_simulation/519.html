        <h1>Chapter 519</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Master Zhao!" Sister Zhao couldn't help but exclaim in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"No need to worry!" Master Ji Changxi's body was shrouded in a layer of black light, enveloping himself.</p><p></p><p>Sister Zhao instantly recognized that it was a unique divine light displayed by the special power of "The Great Way I Alone" in the "Extermination of Heaven Dao Sutra."</p><p></p><p>All different kinds of energy, in front of this divine power, would be transformed into a form that could be controlled by oneself.</p><p></p><p>She had also briefly practiced this divine skill before! But now...</p><p></p><p>Lowering her head, Sister Zhao carefully hid the ambition and dissatisfaction in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the attention of the senior members of the Great Way Sect present was all focused on the droplet of continuously surging blood in Master Ji Changxi's hand. It seemed like no one noticed anything unusual about her.</p><p></p><p>On Master Ji's body, the black light continued to surge, surrounding the blood droplet.</p><p></p><p>While the black light was constantly roiling, the blood droplet was being consumed.</p><p></p><p>However, before Master Ji could analyze what was happening, a crisp cough suddenly sounded beside him.</p><p></p><p>A trace of surprise immediately surfaced on his face.</p><p></p><p>But this was just the beginning.</p><p></p><p>As if triggering a chain reaction, soon, uncontrollable coughs echoed one after another in the elite gathered hall of the sect.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?!" After personally experiencing the severity of this unknown illness, the elders all had dramatic changes in their expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, interesting..."</p><p></p><p>"Wait, this seems to be..."</p><p></p><p>However, those present were all elite figures among elites in the Xuanhuang immortal realm that had existed for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they used all means possible to suppress the abnormalities in their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Some even with interest began to study it on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the seniors' reactions, Li Fan and Sister Zhao exchanged a glance, feeling slightly relieved in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"The contagiousness and pathogenicity are extremely terrifying. It is truly unprecedented! Perhaps even the 'Immortal Decree' released by Xuantian Sect in a desperate bid before death may not be as potent." A white-haired elder, known as Mo Zhiran, a senior of the Great Way Sect, who was well-versed in the way of medicine, spoke slowly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan only knew that this person was named Mo Zhiran, one of the elders of the Great Way Sect, well-versed in the way of medicine. He led a reclusive life, ignoring the sect's affairs. However, it was said that the pills he made were of extremely high quality. Even the Destiny Gold Pill he had taken before, this person could refine it into a flawed product with seven to eight times the efficacy by matching the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Mo Zhiran started the discussion, and the other elders immediately talked freely, speaking their opinions.</p><p></p><p>"This illness is a case where one is all. As long as it comes into contact with a person, it will spontaneously grow within the cultivator's body. It's okay if it's mild, but if it cannot be suppressed immediately, it turns into a severe condition..."</p><p></p><p>"Mild cases result in a decline in cultivation, while severe cases lead to death and annihilation!"</p><p></p><p>With these words spoken, the expressions of everyone present turned somewhat solemn.</p><p></p><p>"I tried more than ten methods just now, and although they could quickly eliminate the symptoms caused by it, the primal force causing this disease seems to have never truly dispersed. It still resides deep within the body. What is its host? It's really strange..."</p><p></p><p>"We elders, as our cultivation levels are relatively high, could easily suppress the illness. But what about the disciples in the sect? Without the aid of elixirs, I'm afraid..."</p><p></p><p>"First, the inability to cultivate together, and then this bizarre illness..."</p><p></p><p>"The path to immortality is cut off, and the future seems bleak! It's better to return, better to return!"</p><p></p><p>"Raifan, with juniors present, why are you spouting nonsense again?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The grand hall of the sect, usually the most solemn and dignified place, had now become as noisy as a market.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Sister Zhao simply bowed their heads, not daring to show any signs of unease.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice rang out, capturing everyone's attention.</p><p></p><p>The room fell silent in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"I have an idea." Ji Changxi, the sect master of the Great Way Sect, said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"I believe some of you have already noticed that this so-called strange illness is so difficult to prevent completely because it is one of the emerging laws of the world."</p><p></p><p>"The so-called principles of the heavens and the earth. Moreover, it's different from 'incompatible cultivation methods.'"</p><p></p><p>"It is caused by cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>His voice resonated like thunder, causing Li Fan and Sister Zhao to suddenly raise their heads, their minds immediately stirring up waves of shock and horror.</p><p></p><p>Caused by cultivators?</p><p></p><p>Defying the laws of heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that ever since the transmission of the laws for obtaining immortality, there had been no one who could break through to the realm of immortality by defying the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>While a large number of combined Dao cultivators emerged in the world, none succeeded in defying the laws of heaven and earth and breaking through to the realm of immortality.</p><p></p><p>Who could it be?</p><p></p><p>Although the ten immortal sects had their own agendas, they still maintained communication. If a disciple broke through to the realm of immortality, even if they did not give notice beforehand, they would definitely send a message afterward, informing the various sects.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this newly born Immortal Venerable seemed to also be immune to "incapable of harming cultivators with diseases."</p><p></p><p>Such an action that almost went against all cultivators was definitely not the work of one of the immortal sect cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Would one dig one's own grave?</p><p></p><p>So, who was it that not only ascended to the realm of immortality but also wanted to exterminate all cultivators in the world?</p><p></p><p>This was a blatant provocation and declaration of war.</p><p></p><p>Not only Li Fan and Sister Zhao, but the elders and Ji Changxi in the grand hall, too, could not suppress the strands of killing intent emerging in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"We must investigate thoroughly!"</p><p></p><p>"Even if this person is a Longevity Immortal, such actions cannot be forgiven!"</p><p></p><p>"I will immediately meet with the heads of other immortal sects to convey this information. The message will also be sent to Wanxian Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>"We must unite all the top powers in the Xuanhuang Realm. I don't believe this villain can roam free!"</p><p></p><p>"While tracking down the mastermind, we must also pay attention to protecting against this illness. From today on, the Pharmacy Hall will operate at full capacity to ensure sufficient supply of elixirs within our Great Way Sect."</p><p></p><p>"As for outside the Great Way Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Changxi hesitated slightly.</p><p></p><p>"After undergoing multiple tribulations, our Great Way Sect has also suffered heavy losses. I'm afraid we won't be able to protect ourselves..."</p><p></p><p>"Let them reap what they sow."</p><p></p><p>The elders all nodded slightly, showing no objections to Master Ji's decision.</p><p></p><p>"I will also try to find a method to alleviate the symptoms of this strange illness." Mo Zhiran's eyes showed a hint of eagerness.</p><p></p><p>"If we can completely neutralize its harm to cultivators, it's equivalent to defying the laws of heaven and earth once again."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, maybe I will have a chance to achieve Longevity Immortal status."</p>

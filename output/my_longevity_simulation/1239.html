        <h1>Chapter 1239</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"There's no proof, so how can you prove it?" </p><p></p><p>Even though Xu Ke had already sensed that familiar aura from the other person, the sealed Xuanhuang evil spirit behind him was too important. If entrusted to the wrong person, it would definitely cause unimaginable calamity.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Xu Ke had been sealing it alone for so many years. </p><p></p><p>He simply couldn't find someone who was both capable and trustworthy.</p><p></p><p>Li Fanping saw that Xu Ke was so cautious that he even refused him.</p><p></p><p>He didn't get angry, and his laughter echoed endlessly.</p><p></p><p>"It's not I who should prove it to you, but you who should see the truth!"</p><p></p><p>With Li Ping's words, the palace roof of the Holy Emperor's Seat and even the sky of the Great Enlightenment Small World seemed to be torn apart.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke's vision instantly returned to the Xuanhuang Realm, and scenes appeared one after another in front of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the endless night, golden lights appeared from unknown places, stirring up waves of invisible ripples in the dark sea.</p><p></p><p>On the boundless sea, golden chains crisscrossed like a huge net. Inside the golden net, sharp, unwilling, and resentful wails echoed. A consciousness was slowly being erased. And in the center of the gold, the Faceless Holy Emperor stood in the void, his aura chilling.</p><p></p><p>In a rather desolate state, the powerful forces of heaven and earth were bestowed upon the Faceless Holy Emperor. By his side, an ink-black figure appeared and disappeared. Although there was nothing in front of them, it made Xu Ke instinctively feel uneasy.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>These flashing scenes all indicated the close connection between the Faceless Holy Emperor in front of him and the Xuanhuang Dao.</p><p></p><p>And the coffin behind Xu Ke became more and more violent in resistance, as if it couldn't wait to return to the Xuanhuang evil spirit, which also basically confirmed this judgment.</p><p></p><p>But for some reason, Xu Ke still hesitated in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, I have been with this Xuanhuang evil spirit for too long and have been influenced by it without knowing it?" Xu Ke was suddenly shocked.</p><p></p><p>The image of the Faceless Holy Emperor was too positive. So much so that Xu Ke, who was standing on the opposite side of him at this moment, couldn't help but doubt himself.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang evil spirit has been sealed for too long. It has almost exceeded the limit that ordinary cultivators can control. And it is one with the existing Xuanhuang Dao. If it suddenly returns, I'm afraid even the Dao itself will undergo unpredictable extreme changes."</p><p></p><p>"Only I can suppress it first, and then slowly erase all the evil spirits, in order to return the Dao to heaven. In this process, I'm afraid I will still need your help." After a moment of stalemate, Holy Emperor Li Ping spoke again.</p><p></p><p>At these words, there were two completely different reactions in the Holy Emperor's Seat.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke was extremely surprised.</p><p></p><p>And the coffin board behind him, after being quiet for a while, shook even more frantically.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping even vaguely saw a gaze on the pale figure's face that was a hundred times more resentful than before.</p><p></p><p>"You come with me."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping did not urge Xu Ke to hand over the Xuanhuang evil spirit, but took him to a location above the Great Enlightenment Small World.</p><p></p><p>"Can you feel anything different here?"</p><p></p><p>"The fluctuations of the Xuanhuang evil spirit are suppressed and can hardly be felt. Not only the Xuanhuang evil spirit, but also this small world and the Xuanhuang Dao itself..." A trace of shock flashed in Xu Ke's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This is where the eye of the 'Heaven and Earth Myriad Spirits Array' is located. This array seals the sky and cuts off the earth. Not to mention the will of the world, even if a true immortal descends, it can withstand one or two." Li Ping said in a flat tone.</p><p></p><p>In his memory and knowledge, this array could indeed block the descent of true immortals to some extent.</p><p></p><p>"With this array, even if released directly, it cannot escape."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke also knew a thing or two about arrays.</p><p></p><p>The more he observed, the more shocked he became.</p><p></p><p>This Heaven and Earth Myriad Spirits Array was indeed as miraculous as Li Ping said.</p><p></p><p>"If I had this array back then, I wouldn't have had to suppress it personally for thousands of years." In addition to being shocked, Xu Ke couldn't help but feel a little dazed.</p><p></p><p>After visiting the Myriad Spirits Array, Li Ping took Xu Ke to Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>Like a school, it was full of children studying seriously. The innocent faces brought Xu Ke's thoughts back to the small broken temple in Ningyuan City a thousand years ago. The scene from back then overlapped somewhat with the scene in front of him, and Xu Ke couldn't help but be a little stunned.</p><p></p><p>But Yin Shangren's reaction was a bit horrifying.</p><p></p><p>He, who was teaching the children, suddenly froze completely.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of pause, he abruptly stood up and stared at the coffin behind Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>After trembling for a while, he actually split open directly from his body, revealing his other self that had been hidden.</p><p></p><p>All four eyes were filled with unprecedented greed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke frowned slightly. That predatory gaze made him very uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>What concerned him more was the performance of the Xuanhuang evil spirit in the coffin behind him.</p><p></p><p>It was very strange.</p><p></p><p>It suddenly calmed down, and the cursing and bewitching voices that had been floating in Xu Ke's ears disappeared again.</p><p></p><p>But unlike before in the Heaven and Earth Myriad Spirits Array, the Xuanhuang evil spirit itself was not affected.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was as if it had been frightened and stopped on its own.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the Xuanhuang evil spirit once again kept hitting the coffin board, showing its existence.</p><p></p><p>But in Xu Ke's eyes, this was more like a bluff.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's body blocked the way between Yin Shangren and the Xuanhuang evil spirit, which made the two return to normal.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's split body merged again, and he grinned, "I didn't expect that even the mighty Xuanhuang Dao would have a part reduced to this state."</p><p></p><p>"If my brothers knew, I wonder how happy they would be."</p><p></p><p>As Yin Shangren spoke, he smacked his lips, "I have eaten many garbage-like world spirits. I haven't tasted a complete world will yet. I wonder what it tastes like."</p><p></p><p>But then Li Ping telepathically introduced Yin Shangren's background.</p><p></p><p>"The world spirit left behind by the Xuanhuang Realm's devouring greatly admires Mr. White?"</p><p></p><p>At first, Xu Ke still had some doubts, but after seeing the white rib that Yin Shangren cherished, there were no more extra thoughts in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Even though it looked like an ordinary rib, no different from that of an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Ke knew at a glance that it belonged to Mr. White.</p><p></p><p>Mr. White's smiling face appeared in front of Xu Ke's eyes again, but it suddenly shattered in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Only this white rib was left.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke suddenly felt grief.</p><p></p><p>And after Yin Shangren learned about Xu Ke's special relationship with Mr. White, he also put away his previous fierceness and became peaceful.</p><p></p><p>But his eyes still swept over the decayed coffin from time to time.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"With Daoist Yin here, even if it escapes from the layers of restrictions, at most it will end up as a meal on a plate," Li said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke, whose emotions had calmed down, finally believed in the identity and plan of this faceless holy emperor.</p><p></p><p>The moment he let go of his obsession, Xu Ke felt an unprecedented sense of relief.</p><p></p><p>"I have persisted for so long, from now on, let the Xuanhuang Realm fend for itself," Xu Ke thought.</p><p></p><p>"What, are you also interested in It?" Yin Shangren looked at Li Ping with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping briefly recounted what had happened in Luoyan Prefecture, and then said, "It helped me a lot."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren shrugged, "Then I won't fight with you for it. Even if I eat it, at most I'll just have a satisfying meal, but I'll still have to expel it."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping remained silent and did not respond.</p><p></p><p>"That silver needle..." Yin Shangren suddenly showed Li Ping an image.</p><p></p><p>"Does it look like this?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping nodded, "What? Have you seen it before?"</p><p></p><p>"I seem to have some impression, but it was a long time ago." Yin Shangren narrowed his eyes, trying to recall something.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, a long time ago, I saw it in this place. But at that time it wasn't me, it was the remnant memory of a part that I had swallowed. So I can't remember the specific details very clearly. If you're interested, you can go there and take a look, maybe you'll find something." </p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren transmitted a location to Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>"I understand. Let's deal with this matter first. With my current strength, even if I really discover something, I'm afraid it will be difficult to investigate deeply," Li Ping said frankly without any reservations.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, there are too many demons and monsters in the Xuanhuang Realm," Yin Shangren snorted.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Li Ping looked at Xu Ke, "Daoist Yin and I previously planned to gather and bury Mr. Bai's scattered remains so he can rest in peace. After this matter, if you are willing, you can assist us."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke naturally agreed without hesitation, his voice even trembling a little, "Okay, okay."</p><p></p><p>Having successfully persuaded Xu Ke, the guardian, the next step was to release and absorb the Xuanhuang evil thought.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Ping had absolute confidence, he was not careless.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he made ample preparations.</p><p></p><p>The next day, a piece of news spread throughout the entire Holy Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>In seven days, the supreme Holy Emperor will bestow his grace.</p><p></p><p>Any citizen who prays sincerely during these seven days will receive rewards from the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The more sincere the heart, the more generous the reward.</p><p></p><p>Praying to the Holy Emperor was already a compulsory lesson for the citizens of the Great Qi, and now that the Holy Emperor had made it clear that there would be rewards, how could people dare to be remiss?</p><p></p><p>Therefore, within just half a day after the holy decree was issued, Li Ping felt that the destiny of the Great Qi in the Holy Dynasty had become more condensed than ever before.</p><p></p><p>Even the destiny power formed by the [Heavenly Earthly Qi Canon] in his body showed a tendency to transform from purple to gold.</p><p></p><p>"This method is only effective for a short time and cannot last long."</p><p></p><p>"If one breaks their word, they will suffer a backlash, and it's even possible for their realm to fall."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping felt his strength constantly climbing towards the peak, but his heart was very calm.</p><p></p><p>The golden source power was drawn out, and the hearts of the masses converged as one.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Earthly Myriad Spirits Formation slowly began to operate.</p><p></p><p>Blocking all connections with the outside world.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, not only was it impossible to detect the existence of the Great Qi small world from the Xuanhuang Realm, but even Baihua Daoist, who was close by in the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven, suddenly lost his perception of the Great Qi small world.</p><p></p><p>If Li Ping had not notified her in advance, Baihua would have mistakenly thought that the Great Qi had suffered some terrible catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>The process of devouring the Xuanhuang evil thought still required blocking the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao outside.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, something unpredictable might happen.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's state had reached its peak during the seven days of preparation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the eye of the Myriad Spirits Formation, Yin Shangren, Xu Ke, and Yi Shu stood on three feet.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping sat in the air in the center of the three.</p><p></p><p>As a part of the Taiyi Hua Dao Stone, Yi Shu naturally also keenly sensed the unusual changes happening in the Great Qi small world.</p><p></p><p>He took the initiative to come and inquire.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping had nothing he could not tell others, so he directly informed Yi Shu of the plan to devour the Xuanhuang evil thought.</p><p></p><p>After a brief moment of stunned silence, Yi Shu immediately offered to participate and help.</p><p></p><p>He even took the initiative to suggest that in the future, perhaps the cooperation between the Taiyi Sect and the Holy Dynasty's Great Qi could be further deepened.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Ping still agreed to Yi Shu's request.</p><p></p><p>He invited these three people just to put on a show.</p><p></p><p>Everything was under his control within the Heavenly Earthly Myriad Spirits Formation.</p><p></p><p>If Yi Shu behaved himself, so be it, but if there was any unusual movement, Li Ping could refine him with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>Devouring him together with the Xuanhuang evil thought.</p><p></p><p>"Formation, rise!"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping shouted coldly.</p><p></p><p>The three people in the formation felt that the sky suddenly became chaotic.</p><p></p><p>Purple dots flashed from time to time.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they had entered an endless void, leaving the real world.</p><p></p><p>The three of them shuddered.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Li Ping lightly pointed at the decayed wooden coffin placed beside him.</p><p></p><p>Without any violent destructive sound.</p><p></p><p>The wooden sealing layer dissipated like a puff of black smoke.</p><p></p><p>A figure changed from blurry to clear, appearing in the formation in front of Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>Different from the resentful appearance Li Ping had seen before.</p><p></p><p>Smiling slightly, it asked, "Are you going to eat me?"</p><p></p><p>There was no resentment in its eyes, but rather relief and liberation.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai?!" Xu Ke couldn't help but exclaim in shock first.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that Xu Ke lacked composure, but this figure was too similar to Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping was unmoved and nodded calmly, "That's right."</p><p></p><p>"Being able to merge with me, you can consider it a worthy death."</p><p></p><p>With just a simple sentence, the expression on the face of the Xuanhuang evil thought, who was originally calm and unperturbed, suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell are you?!"</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang evil thought could no longer maintain its disguise and screamed hysterically.</p><p></p><p>It suddenly turned into a stream of black qi and pounced towards Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>But in front of Li Ping, it was as if there was an infinite distance.</p><p></p><p>No matter how hard it tried, it simply could not get close.</p><p></p><p>"Noisy."</p><p></p><p>"Once you merge with me, you'll know what I am."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping glanced at the Xuanhuang evil thought.</p><p></p><p>A vast and mighty force descended from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Instantly binding the black smoke transformed by the evil thought.</p><p></p><p>"The will of myriad spirits, the great millstone of heaven and earth!"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping chanted softly, and a purple-gold vortex slowly formed above everyone's heads.</p>

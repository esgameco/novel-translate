        <h1>Chapter 741</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"So, is this the reason why he became a fool?" Nanggong Shirong looked at Guan Changge, who had reappeared but was now smiling foolishly like a demented child, and asked with a somewhat strange expression.</p><p></p><p>"That's right," Xu Bai nodded. "Most of his divine consciousness is immersed in the comprehension of the Dao of the Sword. He refuses to return. For this, I am also helpless..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai couldn't help but cough.</p><p></p><p>Having had a part of his body swallowed by the Infinite Wall, he clearly felt that he had become somewhat weaker. It was as if a portion of his vital energy had been extracted, causing an overall "deficiency".</p><p></p><p>"It seems similar to my 'Extracting Threads' divine ability, but Extracting Threads is more inclined towards the process of physical disintegration. This, however, is like a part of the body being cut away..."</p><p></p><p>The Xu Bai who was just moments ago immersed in the comprehension of the divine ability, now looked a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>Thinking that he had been seriously injured in the Infinite Wall, Nanggong Shirong admonished, "It's okay, you've done your best. The young Guan doesn't want to come out, and we can't do anything about it."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, with his complete body still here, it's enough to report to Old Guan. You should go and rest now, and I'll take care of the rest. I want to see if, faced with this silly and foolish young man, Guan Xingxiu can still be as caring as before." After instructing Xu Bai to rest, Nanggong Shirong let out a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai left as commanded, but his mind remained immersed in the comprehension of the divine ability.</p><p></p><p>And others only thought it was because of his injuries, and paid no attention.</p><p></p><p>Back in Tianliang City, ten days passed in a flash.</p><p></p><p>"Good, this new divine ability I've comprehended is the counterpart to 'Extracting Threads'. It can be called... 'Severing Life'."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai emerged from his enlightenment, his eyes flashing with a sharp light as he looked towards a flying bird passing overhead.</p><p></p><p>Without any warning, the bird he had locked his gaze on seemed to lose control and suddenly plummet from the sky.</p><p></p><p>After flapping its wings repeatedly, it barely managed to recover in mid-air, but its flight speed was now much slower than before.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai retracted his gaze, satisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Imperceptibly, I've taken the life of that living being. Compared to Extracting Threads, the casting is more concealed. And it can be executed instantly, making it difficult for others to detect, as they will only feel their body gradually weakening for no apparent reason."</p><p></p><p>"It can also be used in conjunction with 'Extracting Threads', causing internal and external collapse. In an instant, it can make someone's life and death disappear."</p><p></p><p>"The two combined can be called 'Extracting Threads and Severing Life'."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai took a long breath and slowly stood up.</p><p></p><p>With a powerful technique in hand and a murderous intent arising, Xu Bai momentarily had the thought of finding someone to test it on.</p><p></p><p>But soon, before he could act on it, the desire dissipated without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's gaze sharpened as he noticed something unusual.</p><p></p><p>After all, this clone body did not cultivate the Mysterious Yellow Immortal Heart Sutra. If it were the main body, it would have taken some time to dispel such a thought.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment...</p><p></p><p>This was simply impossible for the main body.</p><p></p><p>Given Li Fan's temperament, he would only think that Guan Changge was seeking his own death, not knowing what he was doing.</p><p></p><p>"Is it the influence of this body?" Xu Bai narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"While enjoying the benefits of the exceptional comprehension ability, must I also bear the changes in my temperament?"</p><p></p><p>"Xu Ke, Mr. Bai..."</p><p></p><p>The main body possessed the Mysterious Yellow Immortal Heart Sutra.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The soul mantra, the clone did not pay much attention to this point.</p><p>After leaving the resting villa and inquiring about the subsequent disappearance of Guan Ge, Xu Bai noticed something unusual.</p><p>Since Nangong Shirong had successfully brought the person in front of them, Guan Xingxiu could no longer use this to attack.</p><p>But Guan Xingxiu's subsequent actions also shocked the people of Tianliang Prefecture who were originally prepared to enjoy the show.</p><p>In front of Nangong Shirong and the other cultivators, Guan Xingxiu summoned the [Falling Star Flying Sword] and directly slaughtered the dazed and drooling Guan Ge.</p><p>"Such an ugly appearance, it truly tarnishes the reputation of your mother. It's better to die early, and I'll go find you again in eighteen years," Guan Xingxiu said coldly before swinging the sword.</p><p>The golden sword qi swept across, and Guan Ge left no trace of flesh and blood. He was instantly reduced to ashes.</p><p>The people of Tianliang Prefecture were also shocked by Guan Xingxiu's decisive and ruthless actions.</p><p>Nangong Shirong's face also stiffened, and he tried to persuade the other party to show restraint.</p><p>However, Guan Xingxiu did not give him any face and directly broke through the void and left.</p><p>Although Nangong Shirong had an uneasy expression, he at least managed to send the plague god away and heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>What happened next left Xu Bai somewhat puzzled.</p><p>It seemed that he was also a major contributor in resolving this matter. However, Nangong Shirong seemed to have forgotten about him, and in the past ten days, there was no reward or even a consolation.</p><p>Instead, it was Yan Yiqiu and the other two who had just followed along and repeatedly angered Nangong Shirong who received some rewards.</p><p>Xu Bai reviewed the various details in the process of handling this matter and pondered what the problem might be.</p><p>After a long time, he finally had an epiphany.</p><p>There was no flaw, as he had performed perfectly from beginning to end.</p><p>Knowing that the Immeasurable Wall had the danger of devouring cultivators at any time, he still bravely took the lead to explore it.</p><p>In just a moment, he found the method to enter the Immeasurable Wall and even managed to bring Gu Changge back.</p><p>...</p><p>It was too perfect.</p><p>If the one who did all this was a cultivator that Nangong Shirong had personally cultivated and knew well, he would surely be very pleased.</p><p>But let's not forget, Xu Bai was an obscure newcomer who joined midway.</p><p>Nangong Shirong would not simply believe that others would wholeheartedly serve him just based on his words.</p><p>So Xu Bai's whole-hearted dedication had instead aroused Nangong Shirong's suspicion.</p><p>"It turns out that being too smart can backfire," Xu Bai shook his head inwardly.</p><p>However, he didn't mind it too much.</p><p>He would just focus on doing his own job diligently.</p><p>He would occasionally complain about the unfair treatment he received to his fellow cultivators, and these words would reach Nangong Shirong's ears, gradually dispelling his doubts.</p><p>But Nangong Shirong still did not completely let down his guard. Xu Bai just pretended not to know and continued as usual.</p><p>Time flew by.</p><p>Two years later, in the Longevity Valley.</p><p>The Separation Disc in Li Fan's hand emitted a dazzling white light.</p><p>Countless arrays constantly emerged and rapidly transformed from the Separation Disc.</p><p>After the white light finally faded, Li Fan keenly noticed that his Separation Disc had grown larger.</p><p>"This is the first failed contestant in the competition of the nine discs," Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p>Before he could carefully study the upgraded Separation Disc, Fang Zaijing's excited shout suddenly rang out.</p><p>"Patriarch, I've finally figured out the specific use of this Apocalypse Stone Tablet!"</p><p>The All-Seeing Eye flew in front of Li Fan, constantly flashing and drawing golden lines.</p>

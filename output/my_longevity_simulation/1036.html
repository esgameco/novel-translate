        <h1>Chapter 1036</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Long before Li Fan released his restrictions on that Foundation Establishment cultivator, Jiang Nian'er had already awakened from her cultivation early. </p><p></p><p>Her spirit was highly vigilant, and her mind began to repeatedly go through the process of setting up the formation.</p><p></p><p>As a Qi Refining stage cultivator now, he was very clear that in front of an opponent at the Foundation Establishment stage, he couldn't withstand a single move.</p><p></p><p>Either the opponent would kill him with one move, or...</p><p></p><p>He would lay down the formation before the opponent made a move!</p><p></p><p>Faced with life and death, Jiang Nian'er exerted his potential to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Although it was the first time setting up the formation, it was as if it had been tempered a thousand times, completed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the opponent lost and searching for a way out in the [Bamboo Sea Dragon Trapping Formation], Jiang Nian'er knew that he had already won half of this contest.</p><p></p><p>Next, it would depend on who could endure longer between him and his opponent.</p><p></p><p>A trace of determination flashed in Jiang Nian'er's eyes, and he once again squeezed out his potential.</p><p></p><p>The speed of absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth around him became even faster.</p><p></p><p>"Out of more than 100,000 people on the island, I was the only one who survived! How can I die here!"</p><p></p><p>"Even if you are a Foundation Establishment cultivator, don't think about beating me!"</p><p></p><p>A hint of viciousness suddenly arose in Jiang Nian'er's heart.</p><p></p><p>Correspondingly, the colors of heaven and earth changed in the Bamboo Sea Dragon Trapping Formation. Countless bamboo leaves, like green flying knives, howled and attacked the Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"It seems he has no problem winning this battle."</p><p></p><p>Every bit of change in Jiang Nian'er was clearly reflected in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>While helping Jiang Nian'er reshape his body, Li Fan also filled his body with informants.</p><p></p><p>After all, how could he make detailed observations of the strange devouring process without some preparation in advance?</p><p></p><p>This fair confrontation did not last long.</p><p></p><p>He was just an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator, and he might have exhausted all his energy just to exchange for a Foundation Establishment cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>It could be seen that he knew nothing about formations, raging in the Dragon Trapping Formation for most of the day, and was finally completely defeated.</p><p></p><p>His breath was weak, and he was not far from death.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Nian'er did not let his guard down and directly remove the formation.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he quietly looked at his opponent outside the formation: "I won this contest."</p><p></p><p>"It's here..." Li Fan's spirit shook.</p><p></p><p>From the perspective of heaven and earth, he clearly saw that as soon as Jiang Nian'er said these words, the originally silent darkness instantly boiled.</p><p></p><p>Like an expanding shadow beast, it enveloped the Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>And then completely swallowed him.</p><p></p><p>The strange dark power completely connected him with the Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Like a pair of giant hands, forcibly kneading them together.</p><p></p><p>After a moment...</p><p></p><p>Jiang Nian'er disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>The Foundation Establishment cultivator who was originally on the verge of death in the formation suddenly flashed a glint of light in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Like a withered tree meeting spring, the aura on his body flourished a thousand times.</p><p></p><p>He stood there in a daze for a while before completely digesting the memories in the Foundation Establishment cultivator's mind.</p><p></p><p>"The weak are prey to the strong, this is the way of heaven and earth. Who told you to lose..." He muttered to himself, his eyes gradually changing from confusion to firmness.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could see that in Jiang Nian'er's sea of consciousness, the consciousness belonging to the original Foundation Establishment cultivator was wailing like a ghost, unwilling to accept its fate.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, there was no other means of resistance. Easily suppressed by Jiang Nian'er.</p><p></p><p>Familiarizing himself with his new body, Jiang Nian'er slowly got up and waved his hand to remove the Dragon Trapping Formation.</p><p></p><p>And then</p><p></p><p>Xu Xu bowed before Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"How does it feel to have the strength of a Foundation Establishment cultivator?" Li Fan asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Very strong. But compared to senior..." Jiang Nian'er didn't dare to raise her head.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, with your abilities, as long as you devour step by step. From Foundation Establishment to Golden Core, then to Nascent Soul..."</p><p></p><p>"Won't there come a day when you surpass me?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Li Fan said this, Jiang Nian'er instantly felt as if struck by lightning, her body trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Because these words were exactly what he was thinking deep in his heart just now!</p><p></p><p>Without saying any sophistry like "junior doesn't dare", Jiang Nian'er felt a chill in his heart. </p><p></p><p>He knew his life was at the mercy of the other party. Maintaining a posture with his forehead against the ground, he dared not move.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Jiang Nian'er only felt his entire body's clothes soaked with cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan's voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Get up."</p><p></p><p>Only then did Jiang Nian'er feel greatly relieved, as if a heavy burden had been lifted.</p><p></p><p>"Those in the world who can use Foundation Establishment to defeat Golden Core are countless. But those who can use Harmonious Dao to defeat Eternal Life..."</p><p></p><p>"Are unprecedented since ancient times."</p><p></p><p>"If you want to take revenge on me, then reach the Eternal Life realm first."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Nian'er felt like falling into an icy abyss, the joy of winning the duel just now completely dissipated in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Eternal Life realm..."</p><p></p><p>These three words were like mountains and seas, pressing down on him until he couldn't breathe.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a good while, there was still no sound coming from the other party.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Jiang Nian'er muster up the courage to raise his head and look.</p><p></p><p>He saw that at some unknown time, the mysterious figure had already disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Nian'er was stunned for a moment, looking around, only he was left on Fanyong Island.</p><p></p><p>Strength leaving his body, Jiang Nian'er plopped down on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The many events since the bizarre outbreak surged in his mind like tides rising and falling.</p><p></p><p>Finally settling.</p><p></p><p>"Wen Nianyu..."</p><p></p><p>"From now on, I am Wen Nianyu."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Nian'er first checked the items on his body, then flew towards Wanxian Island.</p><p></p><p>At first his flight trajectory was a bit crooked, but later it became a straight line, speed getting faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's figure slowly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"This kid's adaptability is not bad."</p><p></p><p>"Let him return to Wanxian Alliance first, see if the bizarre power he possesses will be noticed by the alliance officials."</p><p></p><p>Just now Li Fan had already clearly seen the process of fusion and devouring.</p><p></p><p>Actually, Jiang Nian'er was already of little use to him.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan had a vague feeling that perhaps with Jiang Nian'er's style and methods, he might bring some surprises.</p><p></p><p>"The bizarre power is actually also the laws of heaven and earth, and can be utilized."</p><p></p><p>"Previously there was the method of crafting it into Annihilation Arrows, even able to greatly impact the Profound Net that had already replaced heaven."</p><p></p><p>"If corresponding to the Dao of Heaven in the Profound-Yellow Realm, that would be the laws of heaven in chaos and the bizarre running rampant within several states."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, having found and completed a research objective, did not leave the Congyu Sea immediately, but continued to travel between the many locations of bizarre outbreaks.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally he saw cultivators from the Divination Hall and Martial Hall of Wanxian Alliance come to handle things, but the vast majority had already fallen into a state of deathly stillness.</p><p></p><p>The Congyu Sea region was evidently a bit overwhelmed in the face of such a large-scale bizarre outbreak.</p><p></p><p>However, this situation took a turn for the better with the return of Gongsun Qixuan.</p><p></p><p>Gongsun Qixuan, the person in charge of the Divination Hall of Congyu Sea.</p><p></p><p>Weak and sickly, with a scholarly appearance.</p>

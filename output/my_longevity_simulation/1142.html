            <p>Chapter 1140: The Childhood Image of the Dharma Transmission</p><p></p><p>Wu Ninglu took the jade talisman handed over by Li Fan and put it away, wanting to say something but stopping.</p><p></p><p>"It's only three hundred years! I'll go!" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan just waved his hand, not saying anything more.</p><p></p><p>Following the head of the Sun family, he went to the headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The jade talisman given to Wu Ninglu actually served as a communication talisman, but its essence was also a miniaturized aggregation formation.</p><p></p><p>It contained a split soul of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>While being able to fully monitor Wu Ninglu, its main purpose was to have an eye on the outside and pay close attention to the movements of the Myriad Immortals Alliance at all times.</p><p></p><p>The split soul possessed the origin of the Heavenly Profound Mirror and could lurk within it, supervising the situation of the Myriad Immortals Alliance at all times.</p><p></p><p>After all, during the time guarding the Dharma Transmission Orb, he might be in a state of complete isolation, unable to easily use even the Heavenly Profound Mirror.</p><p></p><p>And the avatar was in the small world of the Great Enlightenment, not easily going out.</p><p></p><p>Leaving a backup was still necessary.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's current strength, the combat power of this split soul he left behind was not much different from an ordinary Harmonious Dao cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The only drawback was that it could not quickly recover after battle like normal cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Without the replenishment of the true body, the power would decrease with each use.</p><p></p><p>As for the good friend Li Fan mentioned to Wu Ninglu...</p><p></p><p>It was naturally the Holy Blood Incarnation he created.</p><p></p><p>However, without the nourishment of the True Immortal Web and the essence of source power, the Holy Fetus had only barely broken through to the Qi Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sent it into the ruins of the Heavenly Sword Sect, where it was subduing the Black Sword Heavenly Wonder.</p><p></p><p>With previous experience, there would be no problem. It just needed time and effort.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Sun Xingyao, the head of the Sun family, had been in the Harmonious Dao for more than five hundred years.</p><p></p><p>When he was young, he had also guarded the Dharma Transmission Orb.</p><p></p><p>On the way to the Alliance headquarters together, he introduced the details of this "job" to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma Transmission Orb is the foundation of our Immortal Alliance. Although it seems to be extremely safe in the headquarters, it actually needs to be on guard against the tricks of villains at all times."</p><p></p><p>"In a thousand years, the Five Elders Council has planned no less than three actions targeting the Dharma Transmission Orb. They tried every means to approach it, and then used a technique called Curse to launch mental attacks on it."</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma Transmission Orb herself..."</p><p></p><p>"Has almost no defense against this. Once affected, it means at least a hundred years of stagnation. The last time the Five Elders Council succeeded, the Immortal Alliance suffered heavy losses. But this matter couldn't be publicized. Just the exchange price of techniques in the Heavenly Profound Mirror almost doubled. The cultivators of the Immortal Alliance were full of complaints..." Sun Xingyao recalled the past events of his youth, shaking his head silently.</p><p></p><p>"So this job of yours is not as simple as it looks."</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, if during the tenure, these malicious attacks are not stopped, causing damage to the Dharma Transmission Orb, what will happen?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>He looked back at Li Fan, paused, and said, "Anyway, the promise remains unchanged. We will take good care of Ninglu. You can go with peace of mind."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>He didn't see it before, but this Sun Xingyao had quite a sense of humor.</p><p></p><p>As light and shadow changed, Li Fan once again returned to the headquarters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Just like before, an illusion appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>This time it was different from the previous image of the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerable he saw.</p><p></p><p>On the boundless fields, smoke rose from cooking fires. On the roof of one of the farmhouses, a very honest-looking boy was lying.</p><p></p><p>Eyes dull, gazing at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Sun Xingyao were standing in the void of the Immortal Alliance headquarters, using the formation to shuttle through.</p><p></p><p>They quickly arrived at the headquarters of the Dharma Protector Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me." Sun Xingyao let out a light shout and slightly made a hand seal.</p><p></p><p>An invisible force field instantly enveloped him and Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power in his body, which had become dormant due to the [Hua Ling Stone] under his feet, became active again.</p><p></p><p>"It has a certain suppressive effect on me, but the effect is not as obvious as it was at lower realms."</p><p></p><p>"If we really start fighting, I'm still invincible in the Harmonious Dao realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was calm in his heart and followed Sun Xingyao all the way into the Dharma Protector Hall.</p><p></p><p>Unlike before, when using the Jianfa Jade Tablet, they were in the waiting space.</p><p></p><p>But this time, they truly arrived at the location of the Dharma Protector Hall.</p><p></p><p>The circular dome was densely dotted with countless starry points.</p>

            <p>With a flicker in his heart, Li Fan held the withered branch of the Ruo Mu like wood tightly in his hand and pondered carefully. After a long while, lost in thought, he shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It is similar but different, as if originating from the same source, yet there are distinct differences."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, with the way the Decayed Wood Daoist detests cultivators, the possibility of him trading with Jiao Xiuyuan seems unlikely."</p><p></p><p>"So, this means..."</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's mind, a sudden scene flashed by again - the image of cultivators besieging the Ruo Mu tree and the trunk splitting open, with many branches falling from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, when these separated branches fell into the Xuanhuang Realm back then, they had a completely new destiny."</p><p></p><p>The vitality of plants always proves unexpectedly tenacious. Even ordinary plants often experience the phenomenon of regrowth from broken branches.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the peculiar existence of Ruo Mu, capable of giving birth to living fruits.</p><p></p><p>"However, whether Jiao Xiuyuan really came from the fallen branches of Ruo Mu, or merely found the remnants from back then to be used as materials for refining clones, this is difficult to judge for now."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, a new bud suddenly sprouted from the withered branch of Ruo Mu in Li Fan's hand.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the bud grew into a tender new branch.</p><p></p><p>At the tip of the branch, like a fruit, hung a small golden spherical object.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes twitched.</p><p></p><p>This "golden fruit" was naturally the golden elixir promised by the Decayed Wood Daoist to be presented to him.</p><p></p><p>However, the way it was stored was quite peculiar.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan reached out to pick the golden elixir.</p><p></p><p>A slight resistance force emanated from the "fruit."</p><p></p><p>With some effort, Li Fan successfully removed the golden elixir.</p><p></p><p>Due to the reaction, the new branch suddenly swung backward, then kept swaying in the air.</p><p></p><p>But after only a short while, with a swish, it retracted back into the withered branch of Ruo Mu.</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan could react, it emerged once again with another golden elixir.</p><p></p><p>Watching the withered branch looking almost alive, Li Fan felt a sense of solemnity.</p><p></p><p>He proceeded cautiously, plucking the golden elixirs as if picking fruits, one by one, until he had taken all that it bore.</p><p></p><p>It took nearly the time to burn an incense stick.</p><p></p><p>A total of three hundred and seventy-two pieces.</p><p></p><p>When all the golden elixirs were handed over, the withered branch of Ruo Mu completed its mission.</p><p></p><p>Turning into ashes, it dissipated with the wind.</p><p></p><p>During the process of "picking the fruits," Li Fan seemed to store the golden elixirs in his storage ring, but in reality, he had quietly begun to absorb them using the "Stillness" technique.</p><p></p><p>Similar to the earlier assumption, a single method golden elixir only increased the anchoring energy progress by 25%.</p><p></p><p>Dual-method golden elixirs were at 5%.</p><p></p><p>However, the triple-method golden elixirs made a qualitative leap. A single one could provide a 2% increase in progress.</p><p></p><p>Yet among the three hundred-plus golden elixirs, triple-method ones were a minority.</p><p></p><p>The majority were single and dual ones.</p><p></p><p>There were no quadruple or higher methods at all.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, after unlocking the fifth anchoring point, only sixteen specially chosen golden elixirs were left by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan did not choose based on the quantity of the golden elixirs.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he judged based on the rarity of the method of the elixirs.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary elemental methods were not as exquisite as Li Fan's own insights, so there was no need to keep them.</p><p></p><p>Some involved areas that were still shallow in Li Fan's knowledge, making them valuable for him as a nascent infant cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The entire Foundation Building realm was a process of cultivating and perfecting one's personal Immortal Mansion domain.</p><p></p><p>The more complete the Immortal Mansion domain, the stronger the combat power displayed by the Foundation Building cultivator.</p><p></p><p>When one could almost mirror the external Xuanhuang Realm environment, then one could foresee entry into the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p></p><p>The specific details were still unclear to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>However, the process in general was vaguely understood by him.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "Plucking the essence of heaven and earth to attain divinity."</p><p></p><p>The essence of heaven, as the name suggests, has functions akin to the bone marrow of humans.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial function of human marrow is blood production.</p><p></p><p>The heavens' essence, however, is the creation of laws.</p><p></p><p>Without blood, a person dies; without laws, heaven and earth perish.</p><p></p><p>By disguising one's personal Immortal Mansion as the primary environment of the Xuanhuang Realm, one deceives the innate law-creation behaviors of the heavenly essence, thus incorporating the subtle laws that should have appeared in the world as one's own.</p><p></p><p>Just as the human marrow, aside from its blood creation function, also serves as an immune and defense system.</p><p></p><p>The heavens' essence possesses a certain countermeasure ability as well.</p><p></p><p>Thus, during the process of "Harvesting heavens' essence," one must be vigilant against counterattacks from heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Usually, only one law can be extracted at a time, and one must not be overly greedy, proceeding with caution.</p><p></p><p>If sacrificing the soul of heaven and earth is the act of openly claiming laws for oneself with sufficient strength, then harvesting heavens' essence is secretly stealing laws while one's strength is still weak.</p><p></p><p>By strengthening oneself and weakening the opponent, one narrows the gap between the two parties.</p><p></p><p>This adequately prepares for the future process of integration.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, now standing at the level of the Nascent Infant realm, mentally replayed the process of "harvesting heavens' essence" again and found a different, deeper understanding compared to when he was in the Golden Elixir realm.</p><p></p><p>"Skill of discipleship is truly a rare gift."</p><p></p><p>"Starting from the wonders of the false heavens and earth, exploring the laws of heaven and earth, transforming an ordinary mortal who couldn't cultivate into someone who can encompass the entire cultivation system of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"Then seizing the essence of heaven and earth, and extracting the marrow of heaven and earth to bridge the gap between oneself and heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"Sacrificing the soul of heaven and earth, wielding the power to vie with heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"Finally, challenging the laws of heaven and earth, replacing them, and eternally achieving immortality."</p><p></p><p>"Step by step, with a clear goal..."</p><p></p><p>"It is truly unpredictable. No wonder, even with the power of heaven and earth, before the new method cultivator, they often end up defeated and compelled to retaliate."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed once more.</p><p></p><p>Looking back at the cultivation steps, Li Fan suddenly felt a stir in his heart, realizing that the process seemed oddly familiar to him, resembling certain memories.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he attempted to ponder further, the insight that had just emerged in his mind vanished abruptly.</p><p></p><p>Even with the use of the Transcendence Stone, he couldn't recall it.</p><p></p><p>A feeling of disappointment surged in Li Fan's heart, unable to shake off.</p><p></p><p>"Strange..."</p><p></p><p>Squinting his eyes, Li Fan fell into a deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>He almost dared to affirm that the sudden enlightenment he had just experienced wouldn't have disappeared so quickly under normal circumstances.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that he had been influenced by some force, causing that fleeting insight to vanish suddenly.</p><p></p><p>"It's similar to what I went through in Senior Sister Zhao's illusion realm."</p><p></p><p>"Being confined in a secret room, every time I tried to cultivate, the walls of the room would deliberately make noisy, mocking sounds, attempting to stop me from focusing on cultivation and recovering."</p><p></p><p>"The constraints in the Xuanhuang Realm are even more discreet, unknown to many."</p><p></p><p>"Is it the Senior Transcendental Master who passes down methods...?"</p><p></p><p>Looking up suddenly, Li Fan's expression was inexplicable.</p>

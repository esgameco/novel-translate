            <p>The clone created is one realm lower than the original. New 69 Book Bar ‚Üí 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Currently, Li Fan is at the early Yuan Ying stage, while his clone Li Qing is only at the peak of the Golden Core stage.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it only has an empty shell of the realm, lacking the foundation-building strange objects and the law of the Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>However, this is not a difficult matter for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good opportunity to test the difference between a clone made from the essence and blood of a small world's Heavenly Dao incarnation and Mr. Bai's."</p><p></p><p>With his clone, he quietly returned to the Sword Tomb of the Heavenly Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>He came to the front of the ordinary-looking black sword.</p><p></p><p>Not competing for a seat beside the wooden sword Tian Zhi Qi, he didn't have to face the oppression of the myriad swords in the Sword Tomb.</p><p></p><p>Under the protection of the original body, the clone was barely able to survive in this Sword Tomb.</p><p></p><p>However, whenever he had the idea of taking away the black sword, a faint killing intent would emanate from the center of the Sword Tomb.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly in his heart, completely ignoring the other party's dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>He released several seven-colored divine lights to protect the clone Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Li Qing approached the black sword and sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>He used the sword intent condensed from his own mind to nurture it.</p><p></p><p>That's right, Li Fan wanted to use his own understanding of the Sword Dao to ripen this black sword!</p><p></p><p>Since Li Fan's understanding of the Sword Dao basically originated from the wooden sword Tian Zhi Qi,</p><p></p><p>It could be said that it came from the same source as the one that nurtured the black sword.</p><p></p><p>So there was no fierce resistance.</p><p></p><p>Just like this, the clone Li Qing slowly imprinted his own mark on the black sword, bit by bit. New 69 Book Bar 85üÖ¢üÖóüÖ§üÖß.üÖíüÖûüÖú</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was due to the innate talent of the clone originating from the Heavenly Dao incarnation, after a period of time, the killing intent from the wooden sword Tian Zhi Qi slowly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have accepted this outcome.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan observed for a while longer in the Sword Tomb, and only after making sure that nothing would go wrong did he quietly leave.</p><p></p><p>Of course, before leaving, Li Fan also left the clone Li Qing with sufficient means.</p><p></p><p>Ensuring that even if something unexpected happened, he could forcibly pull out the black sword and retreat safely.</p><p></p><p>"With the simultaneous catalysis of the clone, the time required for the black sword to transform into a strange object is greatly reduced. It is estimated that it will only take one year to emerge. Although compared to natural nurturing, its power may be slightly reduced. But for me, it doesn't matter."</p><p></p><p>As for the clone's future path, since it had not yet experienced the foundation building of Tian Zhi Qi, Li Fan did not make preparations for a rainy day.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the foundation building of Tian Zhi Qi is different from other strange objects. There is no need to find other cave heavens, the law of life, or the soul of heaven and earth. Tian Zhi Qi alone can completely replace them."</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how it goes specifically."</p><p></p><p>"If it is really like this, under the new law cultivation system, this advantage is too great. Without the shackles of these necessary resources, I'm afraid the clone's cultivation speed will be even faster than mine, who sits back and enjoys the benefits with the „ÄêSitting Immortal Jue„Äë."</p><p></p><p>"At that time..."</p><p></p><p>In principle, the clone's cultivation cannot surpass the original body.

He has a good heart, so you probably don't need to worry about your life being in danger."</p><p></p><p>Senior Shiban said straightforwardly.</p><p></p><p>"As for other matters regarding the Xuantian Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt that the infant, who had his eyes closed and was sleeping soundly, seemed to smile at him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Sect, replacing the heavens. Even the Xuanhuang Dao met such a fate, let alone a small broken stone tablet like me."</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, I really miss those years. Although I closed my eyes and played the blind man, it was really quiet."</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for being forced by someone, I really wouldn't want to join in the excitement."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately..."</p><p></p><p>Senior Shiban's words suddenly took a turn: "However, if you want to rejoin the Xuantian Sect now, perhaps I can help you."</p><p></p><p>"I don't ask for anything else, I just hope for a moment of peace."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, a map appeared on the ground in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The terrain was unique, and Li Fan, who was familiar with the Xuanhuang topography, recognized at a glance the location depicted in the map.</p><p></p><p>"Go and take a stroll here, you might gain something."</p><p></p><p>With that, Li Fan felt a flash before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he appeared outside the small broken temple.</p><p></p><p>It was clearly the territory of their Wanjie Alliance, yet Senior Shiban had turned the tables and expelled him from the realm!</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan was not angry.</p><p></p><p>He flew towards the address on the stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>Now that the situation had eased, he didn't encounter any special circumstances along the way.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the number of Patrolling Heavenly Arrows overhead seemed to be increasing.</p><p></p><p>Originally, there were only a handful in the entire Wanxian Alliance territory.</p><p></p><p>But now, there were at least three Patrolling Heavenly Arrows patrolling day and night above each state.</p><p></p><p>It could be seen that during this period, the military development of the Wanxian Alliance had reached a terrifying level.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, these Patrolling Heavenly Arrows did not attack indiscriminately, and seemed to have a unique way of distinguishing cultivators, only targeting the Five Elders Society cultivators.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan had secret techniques to protect himself, so he managed to get by with some thrills but no danger.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Li Fan arrived at his destination.</p><p></p><p>A ring-shaped mountain, with blooming flowers inside the mountain mouth instead of scorching lava.</p><p></p><p>However, it was just an illusion when viewed from afar.</p><p></p><p>In fact, these flowers were all formed by the dissipation of a special spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>This kind of spiritual power could not be absorbed by cultivators, and transformed into different flower shapes in the air.</p><p></p><p>This place was located in Dongyong State, not a particularly remote area.</p><p></p><p>Because of this unique scenery, it always attracted many people to come and enjoy it.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan arrived here, he could even see cultivators coming together in twos and threes.</p><p></p><p>"He really likes to be a riddle person, what does he want me to do here?"</p>

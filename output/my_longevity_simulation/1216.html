            <p>Chapter 1214: Purple Qi Enters the Starry Sky</p><p></p><p>"This split soul originally wanted to stay for the most critical moment. —(••÷[ ❻➈𝕊ℍ𝕌᙭.ςｏ𝐌 ]÷••)—"</p><p></p><p>"Now it seems that it has no choice but to make a move."</p><p></p><p>Lurking beside Wu Ninglu, it was already very familiar with her behavior and way of handling matters. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan's split soul controlled her body, found an excuse to leave the Sun family without arousing anyone's suspicion.</p><p></p><p>After getting rid of the tracking from the Medicine Hall Chen family, it came to a remote and deserted underground place in the wilderness, took materials from the surroundings, and began to build stone puppets.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to send these stone puppets to the border of the Xuanhuang Realm before the Sixteen Harmonies Dao left the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>To closely observe their method of escape.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's current attainments in formations, he was not worried about being noticed by the people of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"They say that split bodies lack skills, I have already dispersed quite a bit, but it still seems a bit insufficient."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's split soul felt a bit helpless.</p><p></p><p>Carefully calculating, the true body was hidden in the Dharma Orb space of the Dharma Protector Hall.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus traveled far to the other side of the starry sea to explore the mysteries of the circulating star power.</p><p></p><p>The split soul of the Immeasurable Mirror was too weak and unable to keep up...</p><p></p><p>As for the Holy Emperor's avatar, it was unfortunately pulled into the Underworld by Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>So only the hidden split soul could take action personally.</p><p></p><p>Let's not mention the situation in the Dark Sea for now.</p><p></p><p>The day when the Myriad Immortals Alliance completed their dharma transmission mission arrived faster than Li Fan had anticipated. ☺💙➅９s𝓗υＸ.ｃσ𝓶🍮🍪</p><p></p><p>On the thirty-third day after the Empty Bright Flowing Crystal was listed as a prohibited item.</p><p></p><p>A dazzling rainbow suddenly appeared between the heaven and earth of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to blend all the colors of the world, twisted and dreamy.</p><p></p><p>Like a reverse shooting star, it pierced the sky and swept away.</p><p></p><p>Under the eyes of everyone, the rainbow light tore open the sky of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The myriad afterglows it left behind did not dissipate for a long time, lingering in the sky for several days.</p><p></p><p>For half a month afterwards, the sky of the Xuanhuang Realm was mottled with seven colors, bizarre and dreamlike.</p><p></p><p>Some curious cultivators tried to capture these scattered rainbow lights.</p><p></p><p>These lights actually had substance, as if they could be collected and refined.</p><p></p><p>And they had the property of making objects emit the same seven-colored light.</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to the Empty Bright Flowing Crystal that the Myriad Immortals Alliance had strictly forbidden discussion of before...</p><p></p><p>How could the cultivators not understand?</p><p></p><p>The revelation of the mystery did not cause any chaos.</p><p></p><p>Because for most cultivators, they did not know about the existence of the Immortal Ruins, and did not even know that the Xuanhuang Realm could not escape at all.</p><p></p><p>They only knew that the communication between the Xuanhuang Realm and the outside world had been cut off for a long time, and guessed that the Myriad Immortals Alliance did this to re-establish contact with each other.</p><p></p><p>But these people were not important at all.</p><p></p><p>The important cultivators, after understanding, began to have different thoughts in their minds. «-(¯`v´¯)-« ６➈Ⓢħᵘ𝕩.Ⓒᵒ𝕞 »-(¯`v´¯)-»</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Immortals Alliance began to have undercurrents surging.</p><p></p><p>Time returned to the moment when the mottled rainbow light left the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>With the help of about a hundred stone puppets' eyes, Li Fan was able to see more clearly the entire process of how the rainbow light left the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The instant it left the Xuanhuang Realm, its flight trajectory was the same as expected, suddenly turning from the original straight line.</p><p></p><p>Turning in the direction of the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>But not all of it.</p><p></p><p>It was like a lump of noodles being gradually stretched.</p><p></p><p>Only a part of the mottled rainbow light was forcibly changed in its trajectory by the suction force of the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>The rest continued unswervingly towards the stars.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the sea, a rapid escape was underway.</p><p></p><p>As the colorful rainbow light continued to advance, more and more hues were attracted and fell towards the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo...</p><p></p><p>The disappearance of these colors also caused the hues of the rainbow light to gradually become monotonous.</p><p></p><p>In the end, only a single purple aura remained.</p><p></p><p>Alone, it flew towards the unknown starry sea.</p><p></p><p>From the perspective of the Xuanhuang Realm below, it looked like a beam of light shot towards the starry sea, dispersed into various different colors.</p><p></p><p>It was just a slightly surprising phenomenon, not even enough to cause much discussion.</p><p></p><p>But in Li Fan's eyes, this scene was almost a miracle.</p><p></p><p>"It actually truly resisted the suction force of the Immortal Ruins?!"</p><p></p><p>"Releasing a portion of the suction force it was subjected to, offsetting the force it received to a certain extent. Then, as it rapidly distanced itself from the Immortal Ruins layer by layer, the attraction it was subjected to became smaller and smaller."</p><p></p><p>"Countless precise calculations were required to accomplish this feat!"</p><p></p><p>"It's not a victory of pure power, but a triumph of 'ingenuity'."</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's mind, the dynamic curve of color separation kept replaying.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to contain endless wonders within.</p><p></p><p>The Huadao Stone crystal was rapidly operating, trying to deduce and reproduce it in his consciousness sea.</p><p></p><p>However, after the separation of the yellow light, he began to feel a bit dizzy and couldn't persist.</p><p></p><p>Although he felt a little regretful, he could only stop his actions.</p><p></p><p>"This is the method Chuanfa came up with?"</p><p></p><p>"Elegant."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could only give this two-word evaluation.</p><p></p><p>"The Kongming Flow Crystal should only be used for the separation of different colors."</p><p></p><p>"As for the original driving force for flying out of the Xuanhuang Realm, it should still be those sixteen Hedao cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"When Changsheng realm is bound to the heaven and earth of Xuanhuang Realm, unless one reaches Chuanfa's level, it should not be easy to leave. Hedao is already the highest combat power that Xuanhuang can deploy."</p><p></p><p>"Although they were nurtured by the Wanxian Alliance, I can feel that the auras of those sixteen Hedao cultivators are not weak."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts surged.</p><p></p><p>The scene of this colorful rainbow light leaving Xuanhuang still gave him a deep shock.</p><p></p><p>When someone easily accomplishes a goal that you have tried for a long time but failed to achieve, only then will people truly feel the existence of the gap.</p><p></p><p>"Chuanfa Tianzun is indeed beyond the reach of ordinary people."</p><p></p><p>"But it doesn't matter, as long as I grasp this method, when I return..."</p><p></p><p>"I will be ahead of him again."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Holy Dynasty was greatly started.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang looked at Yi Shu with some strangeness.</p><p></p><p>Recently, this senior would occasionally suddenly freeze while talking.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't personally witnessed the terror of the Huadao Stone Mother and knew that this should be the Stone Mother calling for computing power, Sun Erlang might have thought he had some kind of dementia.</p><p></p><p>But what exactly was the Stone Mother doing that even affected these separated bodies of Taiyi Sect?</p><p></p><p>Having interacted with Yi Shu for some time and understanding the temperament of the Taiyi Sect collective.</p><p></p><p>He didn't make his own wild guesses and directly asked.</p><p></p><p>Yi Shu took a good while before coming back to his senses.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, I just thought of a way to escape in some extreme situations without abandoning the Stone Mother's main body."</p><p></p><p>"Before achieving complete information indestructibility, losing the Huadao Stone's main body would still have a huge impact on us." Yi Shu explained to Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>"Extreme situations?" Having personally witnessed the power of the Stone Mother and reincarnated in the simulated world, Sun Erlang found it hard to imagine what kind of disaster could force the Stone Mother to flee in such a miserable state.</p>

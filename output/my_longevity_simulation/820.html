            <p>And just when everyone thought the situation was about to become one-sided...</p><p></p><p>Squad after squad of black-robed cultivators arrived at the battlefield through the transmission arrays of various states. New 69 Book Bar 8950shux.com</p><p></p><p>The origins of these cultivators were unknown.</p><p></p><p>But each of them was at least at the Nascent Soul stage. The core members were at the Void Refinement stage, and the leaders were at the Unity stage.</p><p></p><p>The combat power they displayed was also extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that the Xuanhuang Realm had not seen a major war for hundreds of years.</p><p></p><p>However, these cultivators fought as if they were veterans of a hundred battles, with an extremely heavy aura of slaughter.</p><p></p><p>They coordinated seamlessly and struck fiercely.</p><p></p><p>A team of four or five Nascent Soul cultivators could surround and kill a Void Refinement cultivator.</p><p></p><p>When the leading Unity stage cultivators made their move, they could even force the Unity stage elders of the Five Elders Council to retreat in defeat.</p><p></p><p>The situation on the battlefield was instantly reversed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who was hiding in Shilin State, happened to witness the actions of this group of black-robed cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the Unity stage leaders left the deepest impression on him.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they condensed the thunder from the sky into a long spear, holding it in their hands.</p><p></p><p>The entire Shilin State was illuminated in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The silver spear was like a dragon, stirring up heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan, who was observing from afar, was affected. It was as if he was in the midst of a raging storm, surrounded by the screams of spiritual energy disturbance. The spiritual power in his body was forced to resonate with it, slowing down its circulation.</p><p></p><p>Before this strike was even unleashed, it caused groups of Five Elders Council cultivators to fall from the sky. New 69 Book Bar â†’ 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was a wooden fan that blocked the silver thunder.</p><p></p><p>This prevented the Five Elders Council from being completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>"This move seems a bit familiar. Wu?" Li Fan couldn't help but narrow his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Before he could continue pondering, another unexpected change occurred on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders Council, whose actions were slightly hindered, actually chose to retreat collectively at the first opportunity.</p><p></p><p>They did not hesitate at all, as if they had planned for this in advance.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in addition to the Unity stage cultivator holding the wooden fan, there was another man sitting in a wooden wheelchair, who calmly unfurled a scroll of formation diagrams.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he laid out numerous formations on the battlefield to delay and prevent the pursuit of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders Council was well-trained, and in just a moment, they had retreated like a receding tide.</p><p></p><p>Only the devastated land was left behind, telling the story of the recent battle.</p><p></p><p>"Rather than a full-scale war, it was more like a probing attack. If they could take it down in one battle, all the better," Li Fan said thoughtfully, looking at the Wanxian Alliance cultivators on the ground of Shilin State, who had survived a disaster and had looks of lingering fear on their faces.</p><p></p><p>They stood in mid-air for a long time, preventing the other side from launching a counterattack.</p><p></p><p>Only when the front line was reorganized and perfected did they transform into black lights and flee. New 69 Book Bar 8950shux.com</p><p></p><p>Although the timely appearance of the black-robed cultivators prevented the overall collapse of the situation, the previous rapid defeat still made the entire Wanxian Alliance feel extremely furious.</p><p></p><p>First, the protective great formations in various places were quickly changed from the "Tianyuan Huasheng Formation" to the more defensive "Wanli Shanhe Formation".</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the Formation Strategy Hall of the Immortal Alliance began a top-down self-investigation.</p><p></p><p>There was no doubt that the Five Elders Council's ability to easily break through the Wanxian Alliance's defenses this time was inseparable from the leakage of the protective great formation.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary formation masters could only know a corner of the great formation.</p><p></p><p>To be so clear about the various loopholes in the protective great formation...</p><p></p><p>It must be a high-level member of the Immortal Alliance's Formation Strategy Hall!</p><p></p><p>If this person was not eliminated, no matter how the protective formations were changed in the future, in the eyes of the enemy...</p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Inside, there was no doubt that everything was as transparent as could be!</p><p></p><p>The severity of this matter can be imagined.</p><p></p><p>Not only at the Immortal Alliance headquarters, but at the Strategy Formation Halls in each state, one could see Formation Masters being taken away for investigation.</p><p></p><p>Although the Five Elders temporarily retreated, the Myriad Immortal Alliance had fallen into intense turmoil.</p><p></p><p>On Haixuan Island in the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli was warmly welcoming the Congyun Sea cultivators who had come to attend the gathering.</p><p></p><p>Most of them were guardians of various islands, while others held positions on Wanxian Island.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention being busy with daily affairs, they were also very busy in the current tense environment.</p><p></p><p>Being able to take time out to attend today's banquet was already giving Ji Shaoli a lot of face.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that the Daoist friends from the Strategy Formation Hall did not grace us with their presence today," Ji Shaoli's avatar said with a look of regret.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, they are busy dealing with all kinds of inspections and are in a state of anxiety. Indeed, they have no time," a cultivator immediately sighed and explained.</p><p></p><p>"I really didn't expect that even the top-secret [Protective Grand Formation] could be betrayed. One can imagine the extent to which the upper echelons of the Strategy Formation Hall have become corrupt."</p><p></p><p>"It is said that in order to quell this matter, the Chief Formation Master of the Strategy Formation Hall, Lu Xichan, has already voluntarily applied for dismissal. Tsk tsk..."</p><p></p><p>"In my opinion, it's not just the Strategy Formation Hall. The entire upper echelons of the Immortal Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Brother Zhang, watch your words..."</p><p></p><p>As they looked on, the later the conversation went, the more taboo and sensitive the topics became.</p><p></p><p>Everyone tactfully stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, Brother Ji, have you changed your temperament? In the past, there were always many beautiful female cultivators accompanying you on the island, but today I didn't see a single one?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Brother Ji dismissed a batch some days ago. I thought he had found new love, but I didn't expect that after such a long time, he still hasn't made a move. It's really a bit strange."</p><p></p><p>Faced with the curious and inquiring gazes from all around, Ji Shaoli let out a long sigh and said, "It's nothing, I'm just tired of playing!"</p><p></p><p>"After indulging in sensual pleasures, I ultimately felt a bit empty."</p><p></p><p>"Especially when the war suddenly broke out some time ago, a good friend of mine from Yishi Linzhou suddenly perished. It made me even more vigilant in my heart."</p><p></p><p>"Compared to enjoyment, one's own cultivation level and realm are more important."</p><p></p><p>"The current situation is changing day by day, and no one knows in which direction it will develop. The higher one's realm is, the higher the chances of survival in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's words immediately drew agreement from many people.</p><p></p><p>"Although our Congyun Sea is located in a remote area, it still borders the territory of the Wulao Sect. Who knows, maybe one day the other side will attack us. We must be prepared!"</p><p></p><p>But it also caused many people to show worry on their faces: "Most of us are only at the Foundation Establishment or Golden Core stage of cultivation. If a great war really breaks out, I'm afraid we'll truly be like duckweed in the wind..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli sighed at the right moment: "Life and death are not up to us!"</p><p></p><p>The phrase "life and death are not up to us" touched the cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>Their expressions varied.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli changed the topic: "This is also another reason why I invited you all to come this time."</p><p></p><p>"Everyone also knows that I once won the grand prize of [Dingyu], and I have quite a fortune."</p><p></p><p>The gazes of the cultivators were instantly attracted.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, if he didn't have a huge fortune, how could these people be so polite to Ji Shaoli?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't it because they were thinking that at a critical moment, they could borrow some contribution points from him to make ends meet?</p><p></p><p>"And I myself have some understanding of investment. Although I have spent a lot indulging in sensual pleasures over the years, overall, my family fortune has doubled again."</p>

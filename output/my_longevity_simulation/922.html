        <h1>Chapter 922</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>It didn't take long for Wei Lu and his group to track down the two of them by following their traces. However, they never expected that in such a short time, the prey they were originally chasing would transform and become the hunters.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage, Li Qing's combat power had almost doubled. Moreover, her methods were ruthless, causing even more damage than Si Ma Jing, who was at the late Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that these people were only doing their job for money. Seeing that the situation was not in their favor, they immediately decided to retreat.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Wei Lu became anxious and couldn't help but stop them. Just in this brief moment of confrontation, Li Qing seized the precise opportunity to directly attack Wei Lu, who was hidden in the shadows, exposing his true face.</p><p></p><p>With his exposure, Wei Lu's face greatly changed. Si Ma Jing was also trembling with anger, and killing intent surged in her eyes for the first time.</p><p></p><p>At this point, no matter what, it was impossible to end on good terms. Wei Lu hardened his heart and promised the bandits his entire fortune, persuading them to take action again.</p><p></p><p>The two sides once again engaged in a fierce battle. After no longer holding back, Li Qing and Si Ma Jing were immediately at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>At the critical moment, in the midst of the great battle, Li Qing seemed to have another breakthrough, causing the extremely Yin energy in the Yin Wind Valley to become violent. The two took the opportunity to escape.</p><p></p><p>From then on, Li Qing and Si Ma Jing fought while retreating, and retreated while fighting, using battles to nurture their strength.</p><p></p><p>In this process, their tacit cooperation became higher and higher. As if their minds were connected, their combined attacks almost doubled their actual combat power.</p><p></p><p>In the end, relying on the geographical advantage of the Yin Wind Valley, they achieved a counter-kill.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Si Ma Jing's disgusted gaze, Wei Lu's mouth opened and closed, seeming to want to say something. But before he could make a sound, he had already been turned to ashes by Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>With the crisis resolved, with Li Qing's help, Si Ma Jing subsequently completed the sect's trial mission. The two returned to the sect together.</p><p></p><p>As for what happened in the Yin Wind Valley, although Wei Lu had plotted against them first, in the end, they had killed him to vent their anger.</p><p></p><p>To avoid punishment from the sect, under Li Qing's persuasion, Si Ma Jing ultimately did not mention this matter to anyone.</p><p></p><p>The disappearance of Wei Lu, a Foundation Establishment disciple, did not attract much attention and was quickly forgotten.</p><p></p><p>Although they were already inseparable, they still had to restrain themselves in public.</p><p></p><p>Si Ma Jing returned to the inner sect and reported back to her master. At the same time, she began to ponder how to persuade her master to accept Li Qing as a disciple, so that the two could meet often in the future.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until half a month later that Si Ma Jing's master, Huo Jing Tong, finally agreed to meet Li Qing after being worn down by her persistent persuasion.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Huo Jing Tong still had some reservations about the fact that Li Qing had been castrated and transformed from male to female.</p><p></p><p>However, these concerns vanished when she met Li Qing in person.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing knelt in the hall, head lowered, waiting for Huo Jing Tong to ask questions.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that after a long time, Huo Jing Tong still had no reaction. Li Qing thought her plan had failed, and couldn't help but look up, only to find that the other party was still staring at her in a daze.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem." After all, Huo Jing Tong was a Primordial Spirit cultivator, and compared to the young girl Si Ma Jing, she had a deeper understanding of the ways of the world.</p><p></p><p>"Jing'er has already told me everything..."</p><p></p><p>Assistant: Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Alright. You may go now," Huo Jingtong said calmly, without giving Li Qing an immediate answer.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing respectfully bowed and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>However, judging from the spiritual sense that the other party had locked onto him, Li Qing knew that the matter was settled.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, seven days later, he received a notification from the sect and was officially accepted as Huo Jingtong's disciple.</p><p></p><p>Although the female disciples of the outer sect were reluctant to see Li Qing leave, they silently blessed him in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing also promised to come back and visit often.</p><p></p><p>After a tender farewell, Li Qing moved into the Yuehua Mountains.</p><p></p><p>The female disciples of the outer sect, longing for Li Qing, threw themselves into cultivation. Quite a few of them broke through the bottlenecks they had been stuck at for a long time and were also able to join the inner sect, fulfilling their wish to visit Li Qing frequently.</p><p></p><p>This is a later story, so let's not mention it for now.</p><p></p><p>The Huo Jingtong lineage resided on Liuyue Peak in the Yuehua Mountains, not far from Lengyue Peak where Senior Sister Zhao lived.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhao Ruoxi was currently in seclusion, so Li Qing naturally had no intention of visiting Lengyue Peak.</p><p></p><p>On Liuyue Peak, there were over a hundred female disciples, the vast majority of whom were virgins.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's arrival here was like a mouse falling into a rice jar.</p><p></p><p>However, he resisted the temptation to misbehave with great determination.</p><p></p><p>The true teachings of the Yuehua lineage, the "Yuehua Hundred Transformations," was indeed a top-level cultivation technique of the Great Dao Sect, far superior to the side-door techniques Li Qing had previously investigated and collected.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing pondered over it repeatedly, unable to contain his joy.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, when he tried to cultivate it, he was even more pleasantly surprised.</p><p></p><p>The pure yin body transformed by the "Incest Scripture" seemed to have a unique advantage in cultivating the "Yuehua Hundred Transformations."</p><p></p><p>After seven days of seclusion, he had already cultivated this technique to a level that matched his own realm, which was the early Golden Core stage.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Qing discovered that cultivating the two techniques together did not burden him.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they complemented and promoted each other, allowing him, who already had a shockingly fast cultivation speed, to have room for further improvement.</p><p></p><p>In the following period, he spent all his spare time and energy on cultivation, except for dealing with Sima Jing.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until both the Incest Scripture and the Yuehua Hundred Transformations were cultivated to the perfection of the early Golden Core stage that he stopped.</p><p></p><p>Counting on his fingers, Li Qing was somewhat shocked to find that only three months had passed.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that after reaching the Golden Core stage, ordinary cultivators' cultivation speed was often calculated in years.</p><p></p><p>It was common for a single seclusion to last more than a decade.</p><p></p><p>For him to go from entering the Golden Core stage to reaching a bottleneck in just three months, without relying on any external objects and consuming very few spirit stones during the cultivation process, was simply unheard of!</p><p></p><p>However, fortunately, the bottleneck Li Qing felt made him slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>"With the current state of my pure yin body, it seems insufficient to continue cultivating the Incest Scripture."</p><p></p><p>"I need more, purer yin energy."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>The figures of hundreds of beautiful female cultivators on Liuyue Peak, each with different physiques and temperaments, couldn't help but appear in his mind.</p><p></p><p>They were all excellent nourishment for his cultivation!</p><p></p><p>However, this was, after all, the inner sect of the Great Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>His early Golden Core cultivation was not enough for him to act recklessly.</p><p></p><p>If he messed around and was discovered, he would probably be deprived of his cultivation on the spot and expelled from the sect.</p><p></p><p>So Li Qing decided...</p>

            <p>Chapter 1058: Mutated Spiritual Energy</p><p></p><p>However, based on past experience, activating the Chaos Character Technique in the Xuanhuang Realm would inevitably attract the attention of the Dharma Transmission and summon him back from the void.</p><p></p><p>With the presence of the Dharma Transmission Celestial Venerable personally suppressing the Xuanhuang Realm, hardly any chaos could arise.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of demons and monsters had to temporarily avoid his sharp edge, so Li Fan generally wouldn't consider this method under normal circumstances.</p><p></p><p>In this seven-colored space, apart from the above two types of creations, there was a third relatively more mature plan for world destruction.</p><p></p><p>That was to launch reinforced small flying objects towards the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>These flying objects, referring to the principle of Tianyang's body transforming into puppets, were like living things.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the part that flew towards the Immortal Ruins to attract the attention of the immortals there, there was another half of the entity existing in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Once it entered the Immortal Ruins, like the prying eyes of humans, it would alert the immortals in the ruins.</p><p></p><p>Then, through the connection between the flying objects, they would traverse the void and lock onto the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Thus achieving the effect of destroying the world with a single glance.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan had unintentionally done before.</p><p></p><p>Apart from these three, the rest were all still under research and development. They were only theoretically feasible and had not been truly tested.</p><p></p><p>For example, in the space of the "Root of Heaven and Earth" in Tianling Prefecture, the crisscrossing lines representing the principles of heaven and earth in the Xuanhuang Realm were cut into pieces one by one, destroying the foundation of the Xuanhuang world, causing the world itself to naturally fall apart.</p><p></p><p>Another example was the large-scale production of magic tools containing the "False Dao" divine ability, spreading and dispersing them to various parts of the Xuanhuang Realm. As a result, it would inevitably cause chaos in the operation of heaven and earth. Filled with erroneous instructions from the Dao, it might even overwrite the original and truly necessary mechanisms for the operation of heaven and earth. This would lead to worldwide turmoil. Then, the Xuanhuang Realm would likely undergo some degree of self-adjustment. It might even trigger drastic changes like "The Dao Cannot Be Jointly Cultivated" again.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, still possessing the essence of the Tianxuan Mirror and having the highest level of authority, was able to voraciously view the sealed files of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The various sufferings and calamities that had occurred on the Xuanhuang earth in the past had long been forgotten by people due to the influence of the divine power of the Carefree Celestial Venerable. Only Li Fan picked them up again and regarded them as treasures.</p><p></p><p>The various world-destroying measures in the "Destruction" space were the only key for Li Fan to contend with the forces at the Eternal Life Realm and above.</p><p></p><p>As the only pure land surviving in the Darkest Star Sea, the existence of the Xuanhuang Realm was the premise for cultivators to survive.</p><p></p><p>And mastering the methods of world destruction meant mastering the bargaining chip to negotiate with everyone in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was not only of great use in this world. As long as Li Fan had not left the Xuanhuang Realm, this place was crucial to him.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Fan simply split out a holy fetus, and then used the Faceless True Immortal Stone Statue to bestow cultivation, forcibly promoting the holy fetus to the Golden Core realm, which was enough to support its research work in the "Destruction" space.</p><p></p><p>After carefully reinforcing the seven-colored divine light seal around, Li Fan quietly left this place.</p><p></p><p>He arrived in the small world of the empire.</p><p></p><p>Due to the fusion with the world of the Lingmu Realm, it caused some subtle changes in the world itself. A large number of exotic beasts in the empire died because they could not adapt to this drastic change in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>And those remaining were all listless, taking nearly two to three years...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>After some time, he slowly recovered his spirit.</p><p></p><p>Now, in the center of the empire, where the royal castle was originally located, there is an additional arched building.</p><p></p><p>It is the testing site established by the Multiverse Union in the empire.</p><p></p><p>The "Dao-One Insects" that can synthesize spiritual energy have undergone three generations of improvement, and now the efficiency of generating spiritual energy has almost doubled.</p><p></p><p>Now, a single world furnace is enough to stably and continuously release spiritual energy for a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>It has basically met the needs of the Multiverse Union.</p><p></p><p>After five years, the overall spiritual energy density of the integrated Lingmu Realm is no weaker than that of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is also due to the vastness of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The work focus of the empire's Qing, Hong and others has also shifted to coordinating the integration of the empire's small worlds with the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the imperial princess, Li Fan gave her another task.</p><p></p><p>In the dome laboratory, the imperial princess was staring intently at the countless Dao-One Insects in the space in front of her, densely packed like black fog.</p><p></p><p>She didn't even notice Li Fan's quiet arrival.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan checked the experimental record.</p><p></p><p>"Progenitor Dao-One Insect variant, 76th test."</p><p></p><p>"After fusing with the fission fungus, although the lifespan of this variant is greatly shortened, the reproduction efficiency has increased by more than a hundredfold."</p><p></p><p>"According to calculations, under sufficient resources, a single Dao-One Insect only needs seven days to multiply the population to the level of hundreds of millions."</p><p></p><p>"Key record information: Although the spiritual energy produced by this kind of Dao-One Insect can also be absorbed by cultivators, and they will not feel any abnormality at first. But if the absorbed amount is too much, exceeding half of the stored spiritual power in the body, it will have a subtle influence on the cultivators. Cultivators will become more irritable and more aggressive."</p><p></p><p>"More crucially, they will develop a certain dependence on the mutated spiritual energy. Feeling that normal spiritual energy is not 'refined' enough."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the detailed experimental information recorded by the imperial princess and nodded with great satisfaction. </p><p></p><p>The imperial bloodline, worthy of being derived from Xu Ke's holy embryo blood, inherited in a single line. The imperial princess perfectly inherited Xu Ke's talent.</p><p></p><p>Many experimental projects led by her in the past five years have made good breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>Especially the research on Dao-One Insect variants.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy generated by Dao-One Insects undergoes many subtle changes in these variants. The newly emerged one that makes cultivators become more irritable is one of them. Previously, there were also those that could make cultivators become lazy and lose their motivation. Or the spiritual energy density is too high, and after absorption, it will produce an effect similar to "spiritual drunkenness". If they continue to absorb, it may even cause irreversible destructive effects on the cultivator's own mind.</p><p></p><p>There are too many to list them all.</p><p></p><p>Although these mutated spiritual energies cannot destroy the Xuanhuang Realm, they can transform cultivators to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>Making the cultivators in a certain area uniformly develop a certain fixed personality.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was really interested in this way.</p><p></p><p>After sealing and collecting the new variant data and hundreds of sample insects into his own grotto-heaven, Li Fan woke up the imperial princess who was still immersed in research.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Envoy!" The imperial princess' eyes flashed a trace of nervousness, and she quickly bowed her head and saluted.</p><p></p><p>"How is the progress of searching for the Holy Emperor?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Half of the small worlds have been ruled out. Still no trace of the Holy Emperor has been found. It is estimated that in five years at most, the remaining worlds can be explored and the location where the Holy Emperor is hiding can be finally locked." The imperial princess answered truthfully.</p>

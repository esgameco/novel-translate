        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Li Fan deliberately slowed down his speed and leisurely returned to the entrance of the Lingmu Realm. </p><p></p><p>Just as he had anticipated, halfway through, the voice of Tian Yi resounded in his mind once again.</p><p></p><p>"Well done."</p><p></p><p>It was evident that Tian Yi had already sensed that the seal of the Yunshui Tiangong had been reinforced.</p><p></p><p>"With your help, it indeed saved me some trouble."</p><p></p><p>"If I were to go..."</p><p></p><p>Tian Yi chuckled lightly, and then his words stopped.</p><p></p><p>"During the process of reinforcing the seal, I encountered some things." Without waiting for Tian Yi to speak again, Li Fan took the initiative to report everything that had happened in the Yunshui Tiangong.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Li Fan couldn't help but ask, "Venerable One, back then, what exactly..."</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Li Fan's address of "Venerable One" had stirred up memories deep within Tian Yi's mind.</p><p></p><p>His tone was unusually rare, with a hint of fluctuation: "Your ability to discover the hidden truth within Hanhai's consciousness truly exceeds my expectations. No wonder with your aptitude, even Tian Jue would regard you as his successor..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression slightly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>"As for what happened back then..."</p><p></p><p>"It's enough for me to bear it alone. Knowing too much is not good for you either."</p><p></p><p>"You are still too weak now. When you reach the peak of the Dao, perhaps you will be qualified to know."</p><p></p><p>Tian Yi rarely explained a few more sentences.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan wanted to say something but stopped. In the end, he just nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, how is your study of the 'Bu Tian Lu' (Mending Heaven Record)? Are there any parts that are difficult to understand?"</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Tian Yi asked again. It seemed that he was going to personally answer Li Fan's doubts and confusions.</p><p></p><p>How could Li Fan miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity? He immediately brought out the parts he had doubts about during his self-study process and sought guidance.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yi was also very patient and answered them one by one.</p><p></p><p>As expected of Tian Yi, his insights into the Dao of "medicine" had already reached a transcendent level.</p><p></p><p>Often with just a few words, Li Fan would have a sudden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Tian Yi's words also derived new arguments that were not recorded in the "Bu Tian Lu".</p><p></p><p>Li Fan absorbed Tian Yi's teachings like a sponge.</p><p></p><p>Good times are always short-lived.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Tian Yi seemed to have encountered something and interrupted the teaching.</p><p></p><p>"You should have been hiding in a small world before, so I spent some effort but still couldn't find you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart trembled, and he was about to answer.</p><p></p><p>But then he heard Tian Yi continue, "Hmm, not a bad choice. Before you have successfully cultivated, it's safer for you to stay in the small world as much as possible."</p><p></p><p>"No matter how powerful a cultivation method is, it ultimately belongs to others. Only the one that truly suits you is the most perfect cultivation method."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing these words, Li Fan felt as if he had been struck by a lightning bolt, his mind shaken.</p><p></p><p>"The method that truly suits oneself?"</p><p></p><p>His eyes were dazed as he fell into endless contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"A gentleman hides his tools within himself and waits for the right time to act. The current Xuanhuang Realm is not yet your true stage. Wait a little longer, it will be soon..." Tian Yi's tone was deep and meaningful.</p><p></p><p>Then, a golden light descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>It flew rapidly and arrived in front of Li Fan in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan finally came back to his senses from his contemplation and looked closely. He saw a golden needle floating in front of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, back then, there was a saying that 'no one is under the needle'..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The world-renowned "Heavenly Doctor of the Six Reincarnations" was widely praised.</p><p></p><p>"If I could keep a few needles, perhaps I could preserve some sparks," the Heavenly Doctor said in a calm voice.</p><p></p><p>"This needle is for your protection. As long as the needle remains, you will not perish."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face lit up with joy. "Thank you, Venerable One!"</p><p></p><p>However, the Heavenly Doctor did not respond again.</p><p></p><p>Without being disrespectful, Li Fan continued to bow towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Then, he looked at the golden needle before him with an indescribable expression.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he reached out his hand, trying to touch it.</p><p></p><p>Unlike a physical needle, it felt cool to the touch.</p><p></p><p>Instead, Li Fan felt a stream of warmth flowing from his palm into his body.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it formed a protective shell, enveloping his entire soul.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt as if his soul was soaking in a warm spring, comfortable and soothing.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a sense of security that he had never experienced before emerged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"What a treasure!" This thought surfaced in Li Fan's mind as he hurried towards the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the Tree People's "afforestation" project had already achieved initial success.</p><p></p><p>Without disturbing them, Li Fan went straight to where the Faceless Stone Statue was located.</p><p></p><p>When his mind connected with the Faceless Stone Statue, images of the believers of the Myriad Realms United Association and the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>A true sense of security surged in his body and mind.</p><p></p><p>Although he had preliminarily determined that the Heavenly Doctor was indeed very "kind" to the cultivators of the Heavenly Law Realm, Li Fan did not let his guard down because of this.</p><p></p><p>He was always on guard against the Heavenly Doctor's mind-reading ability.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was not face-to-face, but just one of his golden needles, Li Fan remained cautious.</p><p></p><p>Having suffered a significant loss before, how could Li Fan accept the golden needle without any reservations before ruling out the possibility that the Heavenly Doctor might sense his thoughts through it?</p><p></p><p>At present, the first thing that Li Fan could think of to counter the Heavenly Doctor was this Faceless Stone Statue.</p><p></p><p>The true strength of the Faceless Immortal was apparently even higher than that of the Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>With the interference of her stone statue, it should be able to shield the Heavenly Doctor's perception.</p><p></p><p>Even though he knew that this was, in a sense, drinking poison to quench thirst, Li Fan still did it.</p><p></p><p>After all, apart from the Mysterious Heavenly King, no one had truly seen the Faceless Immortal.</p><p></p><p>And the Heavenly Doctor was a real opponent that already existed.</p><p></p><p>"Although there are some risks, the gains are undoubtedly enormous."</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention this golden needle, just the Heavenly Doctor's guidance alone is equivalent to ten years of my bitter cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, there was his final reminder."</p><p></p><p>"The operation of the Heavenly Dao, the essence of the world..."</p><p></p><p>"The truly suitable cultivation method for myself..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes slightly, and a preliminary idea gradually formed in his mind.</p><p></p><p>However, he put it aside for now and began to study the golden needle bestowed by the Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>Although it was given by someone else, it seemed to be innate within Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>Without any refining process, he could control it at will.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had never heard of such a method before.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the golden needle reappeared in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"It's not made of any metallic material..." After repeatedly observing it with his spiritual sense, Li Fan reached this conclusion first.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover..." By using the images recorded by the Dao Stone and carefully comparing the golden needle in his memory with the one in front of him, Li Fan made a new discovery.</p>

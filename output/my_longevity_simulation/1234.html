            <p>Chapter 1232: Where the Clear Wind Resides</p><p></p><p>As the pain subsided, what followed was a rapid expansion of the soul. </p><p></p><p>The will of the world, even if it was just the remnant of a single state, was definitely a great nourishment for cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when the Holy Emperor Li Ping was supervising and monitoring the various affairs within the Great Enlightenment, he still received and handled countless trivial matters from the perspective of a "person". But from now on, Li Ping, who had absorbed the consciousness of the Congyu Sea, might also be able to overlook all the details in the Holy Dynasty from the perspective of the "world itself".</p><p></p><p>After the demise of the Congyu Sea's consciousness, there was no wind for seven days.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping stood between the sea and sky, waiting for the complete integration.</p><p></p><p>Even without intentionally doing so, Li Ping, who had devoured the consciousness of the Congyu Sea, could still easily perceive everything that happened within the Congyu Sea.</p><p></p><p>He saw that the vast majority of the cultivators affected by the demon faces still did not recover from their madness after he retracted his divine powers. After this calamity, barely one out of a hundred cultivators remained normal.</p><p></p><p>He saw that the Heavenly Flame of the World, which was brewing in the sky, no longer needed to descend and burn the sea due to the demise of the Congyu Sea's consciousness. The condensed power of laws quietly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>He saw that in the center of the Congyu Sea, the Yunshui Heavenly Palace, which originally had its restrictions loosened and was about to reappear from the seal, once again fell into silence after flashing a mysterious blue glow.</p><p></p><p>He also saw that the anomaly of the Congyu Sea attracted the attention of some beings in the Xuanhuang Realm. Several vast divine senses instantly descended and swept across this ocean. But at this moment, Li Ping, who had replaced the Congyu Sea's consciousness, perfectly integrated into the heaven and earth. With his own formations and the concealment of the Xuanhuang Dao, Li Ping was not discovered.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Although he had temporarily hidden himself, the hidden sense of crisis in Li Ping's heart did not disappear.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that this is not a place to stay for long." Li Ping, who had completely absorbed and digested the Congyu Sea's consciousness, secretly thought.</p><p></p><p>However, before returning to the Great Enlightenment of the Holy Dynasty, he had one more thing to do.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, Li Ping arrived at the bottom of the sea near the Congyu Sea and Liuyun Island.</p><p></p><p>At the bottom of the sea, there was a peculiar whirlpool.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the whirlpool, a pale blue bead emitted a faint glow.</p><p></p><p>"The Canghai Pearl."</p><p></p><p>As part of the Congyu Sea's consciousness's two-way bet, the Canghai Pearl was the Congyu Sea's final way to seek survival.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping stretched out his hand, and the pale blue bead flew out from the whirlpool at the bottom of the sea and landed in his palm.</p><p></p><p>"Since it has become a part of the Xuanhuang Dao, let's completely sever ties with the past."</p><p></p><p>Golden energy enveloped the Canghai Pearl and then poured in fiercely.</p><p></p><p>After the light dissipated, the bead in Li Ping's hand had changed from pale blue to a deep azure color.</p><p></p><p>But it had lost its previous spirituality.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping had completely erased the last remnant of the Congyu Sea's weak consciousness within the Canghai Pearl.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, the Canghai Pearl is just a simple Canghai Pearl and has nothing to do with the Congyu Sea anymore."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping did not keep the bead, but flicked his finger and shot it randomly into a corner of the Congyu Sea, waiting for someone with fate to find it.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Li Ping finally left this ocean.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of an entire state had all turned into idiots.</p><p></p><p>While sending people to investigate, how to deal with these dangerous and mad cultivators also became a difficult problem.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it took five Dao Convergence Realm experts working together to barely clean up the chaos in the Congyu Sea.</p><p></p><p>Among these five people, there happened to be the Sun Family Patriarch, Sun Luyuan.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had tried various methods and finally contacted Fairy Kong You.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan had already thoroughly investigated Kong You's background and knew that she had a simple temperament and wore her emotions on her sleeve. Yet she was particularly curious about novel things, so Sun Luyuan fabricated a half-true and half-false lie.</p><p></p><p>"I heard before that Fairy, you once turned an ungrateful male cultivator into a dog and tormented him day and night?"</p><p></p><p>"That scene was truly unbearable to look at directly. Coincidentally, when I was traveling in a small world before, I also encountered a similar scene. Similarly, it was a means of punishment to transform criminals into the form of beasts..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan selected some of the sights he had seen in the Great Enlightenment of the Holy Dynasty and recounted them.</p><p></p><p>"This small world's emperor actually had the same idea as me without prior consultation? Interesting."</p><p></p><p>"And from your description, the development of this small world is quite extraordinary..."</p><p></p><p>After mentioning it unintentionally a few times, Kong You was indeed attracted as expected.</p><p></p><p>She agreed that if there was an opportunity in the future, she would go and visit with a few other familiar people in the alliance.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the matter had been accomplished, Sun Luyuan was naturally overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>He even thought that it would be better to deceive more talents from the Myriad Immortals Alliance to go over this time under the pretext of Fairy Kong You's name.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that before the plan could be implemented, the Myriad Immortals Alliance would suddenly suffer a tragic disaster. The deception plan had to be temporarily suspended.</p><p></p><p>Originally, this mess in the Congyu Sea had nothing to do with him.</p><p></p><p>However, the chief of the Dharma Protector Hall, Xu Yuanxian, had privately given him a task.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Sun Luyuan have no choice but to make a laborious trip from afar.</p><p></p><p>"Qingfeng Hall. This is the place."</p><p></p><p>After subduing and gathering all the mad cultivators who attacked anyone on sight, Sun Luyuan arrived at this building on the Myriad Immortals Island.</p><p></p><p>He did not sense the aura of any living beings inside.</p><p></p><p>And when Sun Luyuan actually entered and saw the situation inside, his pupils suddenly contracted.</p><p></p><p>An old man lying on a wooden chair had tree roots growing out from all over his body, tightly entangling and fixing him to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Although the old man had not completely died and still had a trace of aura remaining, in Sun Luyuan's eyes, he was no different from a dead person.</p><p></p><p>"This is the guardian of the Qingfeng Hall that Elder Xu mentioned. He had at least Nascent Soul cultivation, yet he died so inexplicably."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>His gaze left the old man and swept across the interior of the Qingfeng Hall.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he discovered a hidden entrance.</p><p></p><p>Raising his vigilance, Sun Luyuan strode through the faintly visible green crevice.</p><p></p><p>It was a slightly spacious space.</p><p></p><p>"Boom! Boom! Boom..."</p><p></p><p>The sound of the earth trembling kept coming.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan looked towards the source of the commotion and actually saw that a large tree had grown two human legs.</p><p></p><p>It was running on the ground.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the tree trunk, there was actually an extremely ancient-looking face.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, that tree face was filled with endless horror.</p><p></p><p>This big tree was running wildly and rapidly, and even because its two legs were not enough to support its body, it kept falling and getting up. But it never stopped its running behavior.</p><p></p><p>It muttered to itself, "Once again, the calamity has arrived. Such a terrifying sight has never been seen even in my father's most vicious curse!"</p><p></p><p>"But...</p><p></p><p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It never happened at all!"</p><p></p><p>"It's not fake, it's not fake!" </p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The tree man spoke incoherently, his words contradicting themselves, making it completely impossible to understand what he was saying. </p><p></p><p>However, he was still deeply trapped in his own hysteria, and even Sun Luyuan's attempts to communicate with him were to no avail.</p><p></p><p>"Number Six has gone mad."</p><p></p><p>Just then, a clear female voice suddenly rang out next to Sun Luyuan's ear.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Sun Luyuan was startled.</p><p></p><p>Because he had previously conducted a detailed search, and apart from that tree man, there seemed to be no one else here.</p><p></p><p>He immediately asked, "Is that Fellow Daoist Qingfeng?"</p><p></p><p>The female voice did not respond.</p><p></p><p>"I was entrusted by Elder Xu to bring you back."</p><p></p><p>"According to him, this spirit wood has gone mad, and the passages within its body are unusable, so Fellow Daoist Qingfeng is trapped here."</p><p></p><p>As Sun Luyuan spoke, he carefully observed his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to confirm the location of this "Qingfeng".</p><p></p><p>But even with his Hedao realm level of observation, he still had no gains whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>"Number Six has gone mad," the female voice still did not directly respond, only repeating this again.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan couldn't help but frown slightly, wondering if this female cultivator had also been affected by the demon face and turned crazy.</p><p></p><p>"Number Six and I had the best relationship. Now that it has gone mad, who will play with me in the future?"</p><p></p><p>The ethereal voice echoed in this not-so-large space.</p><p></p><p>Overlapping with the tree man Number Six's occasional wails, it sent chills down one's spine.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Sun Luyuan felt the same eerie feeling in his heart as when he had wandered around the Great Enlightenment of the Holy Dynasty before.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qingfeng..." Sun Luyuan coughed lightly, steeling himself.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know the relationship between this female cultivator named Qingfeng and Elder Xu,</p><p></p><p>for the usually strict and uncompromising Elder Xu to make an exception and privately ask him, it was enough to show that their relationship must be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, things did not develop as Sun Luyuan had anticipated.</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng seemed to sob for a while, then finally emerged from her grief.</p><p></p><p>"So you were sent by Little Xu. So he hasn't forgotten me after all."</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng's simple words made Sun Luyuan's hair stand on end.</p><p></p><p>"Little Xu? Xu Yuanxian?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan almost doubted his own ears.</p><p></p><p>Elder Xu had served as the chief of the Protector Hall for a full three thousand years, and was a genuine old monster.</p><p></p><p>Yet this girl, who sounded very young, called him Little Xu...</p><p></p><p>Just who was this Qingfeng?</p><p></p><p>Countless thoughts flashed through Sun Luyuan's mind in an instant, but he dared not dwell on them, and his expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>He also didn't dare to address her as "Fellow Daoist Qingfeng" anymore, carefully changing his words to ask, "Senior, why do you not show yourself? Is there anything this junior has done wrong?"</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence in the space,</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng's somewhat strange voice sounded behind Sun Luyuan.</p><p></p><p>"Haven't I been here all along?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, right. I forgot, ordinary people can't see me."</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng's words made Sun Luyuan break out in a cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Xu said that he will send someone to deal with this mad spirit wood later. Please, Senior, come with me for now," Sun Luyuan hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"Ah! That's great. I knew Number Six could still be saved," Qingfeng rejoiced like a simple little girl in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"It's all because that doomsday wailing scene was too scary, it temporarily scared it silly. If you hadn't come, I would have had no one to talk to for a long time."</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng's voice got closer and closer to Sun Luyuan.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it seemed to settle on his back.</p><p></p><p>"Alright. I'll listen to Little Xu and leave this place for now."</p><p></p><p>"The aura here has changed, it's become quite unpleasant."</p><p></p><p>Feeling the weight that seemed to truly exist on his back, Sun Luyuan's heart raced as he wiped the cold sweat from his forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Shall this junior just leave directly?" He asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I'm already on your back."</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng's words confirmed Sun Luyuan's guess.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan didn't dare to linger, and left this bizarre space directly.</p><p></p><p>The mad spirit wood's voice still echoed here incessantly.</p><p></p><p>"Are we going back to the Immortal Alliance headquarters?" Sun Luyuan, who had turned into a streak of light and was flying at high speed in the Congyun Sea, asked again.</p><p></p><p>"Not there. That place is also unpleasant. Let's go to Luoyan Province."</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng's mood seemed to have improved, and she said with some cheer in her voice.</p><p></p><p>Elder Xu's task was merely for him to bring Qingfeng out and settle her in a Qingfeng Hall in another province.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan didn't dwell on it and headed towards Luoyan Province.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, he also pondered the true identity of the one on his back.</p><p></p><p>With the Boundless Mirror artifact at home, Sun Luyuan prided himself on being knowledgeable enough.</p><p></p><p>However, he had never heard of anything similar to Qingfeng's bizarre existence before.</p><p></p><p>Even Qingfeng's cultivation level, he couldn't grasp.</p><p></p><p>Elder Xu had him travel thousands of miles just because he was worried about her being trapped?</p><p></p><p>From this perspective, Qingfeng's cultivation level definitely couldn't be that high.</p><p></p><p>But Qingfeng's strange wording and various bizarre behaviors made Sun Luyuan's heart numb.</p><p></p><p>Very clearly, this formless and shapeless existence called Qingfeng was not simple.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan inwardly cried bitterly and sped up even more.</p><p></p><p>He just wanted to complete the task as soon as possible and get rid of her.</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng didn't say a word along the way.</p><p></p><p>And he was getting closer and closer to Luoyan Province.</p><p></p><p>Just as he saw hope of being free, Qingfeng's next words made Sun Luyuan feel like he had fallen into an icy abyss.</p><p></p><p>"You're getting a bit impatient."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, there aren't many in the world who are good to me."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan only felt a chill rising from his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although Qingfeng didn't say anything else after that, his unease grew stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not quite right."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan knew some changes were happening to his body.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't detect the specific details of the changes.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until Sun Luyuan arrived within Luoyan Province and casually glanced down that he suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was very close to the ground.</p><p></p><p>A scorching sun blazed overhead.</p><p></p><p>But strangely, there was no shadow of him on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan was very clear that he hadn't used any techniques to conceal his figure.</p><p></p><p>But his shadow had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He stretched out his arms in a daze.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to be becoming illusory.</p><p></p><p>His existence was disappearing.</p><p></p><p>He was about to become formless and shapeless, just like Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>The change came so quickly that Sun Luyuan's mind was blank, and he didn't even have time to feel fear.</p><p></p><p>Just as Sun Luyuan felt that his connection with this world was getting weaker and weaker...</p><p></p><p>A blazing golden light suddenly surged out from within his body.</p>

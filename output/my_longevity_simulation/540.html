        <div class="content">
            <p>"You should go and prepare well for the inauguration ceremony. There mustn't be any mistakes," he said calmly, still concentrating on the information written on the bamboo slips.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then bid farewell.</p><p></p><p>Returning to his temporary residence, he called out Gao Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Lord of the city, do you need me for something?" Gao Yuan's face was all smiles as he nodded and bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"The rewards from the Immortal Alliance headquarters have been issued, and I will be appointed as the political hall's secret envoy. From now on, you must address me correctly, and no longer use the wrong titles," Li Fan spoke in the same calm tone as the first prime minister.</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan was initially stunned, but before he could respond, Li Fan continued, "The reconstruction of the Immortal City is underway, and there are many tasks to be completed. Hongxi and Ziyun, the two immortal lords, are still absent, so I will temporarily take full authority to handle all political affairs in the Cloudsea. "</p><p></p><p>It was only at this moment that Gao Yuan finally regained his senses.</p><p></p><p>There was an uncontrollable joy in his eyes, and he kept saying, "Congratulations, Secret Envoy! Your abilities have been witnessed by all over the past half year. With Lord Hongxi and the others absent, having you oversee the political affairs is a blessing for us in the Cloudsea!"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the lord is not aware, but in the past six months, every cultivator I met has praised and respected your methods," Gao Yuan continued.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>Although he knew Gao Yuan was flattering him, who didn't enjoy hearing good things about themselves?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan waved his hand, interrupting Gao Yuan's endless flattery, and took out a piece of paper from his sleeve, gently throwing it over.</p><p></p><p>"This is a list of cultivators ranked based on their contributions during the reconstruction of Cloud City."</p><p></p><p>"During the reconstruction of the new city, I have a third of the internal recommendation quota for the vacant positions in the city. In addition to those who have already pledged their allegiance, there are still many vacancies. Take a look and see which individuals can be utilized from this list," Li Fan said, hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan received the paper filled with names and although it was as thin as a cicada's wings, it felt as heavy as a mountain in his hands. His hands trembled continuously, and even his breathing became rapid.</p><p></p><p>Why did Gao Yuan pledge his loyalty to Li Fan? Wasn't it for this day?</p><p></p><p>One word can determine and change someone's destiny - this is the taste of power.</p><p></p><p>Knowing this was Li Fan's final test, Gao Yuan took a deep breath to calm himself, his gaze scanning the list and quickly making assessments.</p><p></p><p>"I recommend Fang Weihou from these cultivators. Although he is only a Golden Core cultivator, he is diligent and meticulous in his work. In the past six months, everything he was tasked to do was completed ahead of time without fail. More importantly, he has no significant background and has relied on his own cultivation for years."</p><p></p><p>"There is also a cultivator named Jia Jun, whose abilities are also outstanding," Gao Yuan spoke confidently.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't been idle in the past six months.</p><p></p><p>Although he seemed to wander aimlessly every day, his eyes had nearly observed every move of each cultivator. Li Fan, based on Gao Yuan's evaluations of these cultivators, quickly replayed in his mind the surveillance and recordings from the past six months.</p><p></p><p>After carefully comparing them all, he nodded slowly.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, having stood guard at the entrance of the Political Hall for almost half his life, Gao Yuan's ability to judge people was truly remarkable.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan felt that he might not have done it better himself.</p><p></p><p>"Very well," he praised, a rare occasion for him.</p><p></p><p>"I have made my decision." He then lightly pointed, and dozens of names were encircled on the paper held by Gao Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"These people need to be informed in advance so they can prepare themselves. There mustn't be any mistakes in tomorrow's inauguration ceremony," Li Fan instructed.</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan's expression turned serious as he respectfully received the command and withdrew.</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Immortal City was high up in the sky. Looking from afar, one could see the shimmering light of the activated protective array surrounding it.</p><p></p><p>Nearly all the cultivators from Cloudsea gathered here.</p><p></p><p>Looking up at the new city from below, they conversed with each other, filled with mixed emotions.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the crowd's attention, Li Fan appeared once again, stepping forth with a puppet of a Divine Lord under his feet.</p><p></p><p>"Welcome, Island Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Many of the cultivators below suddenly shouted in unison.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and waved his hand, "Today marks the completion of the Cloud Immortal City's reconstruction, and my temporary stewardship as the Island Lord has come to an end."</p><p></p><p>"Friends, you must no longer address me as such."</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the Cloud City in the sky, sighing, "The collective efforts to rebuild this city within half a year were not easy. I'm also honored to have been part of it!"</p><p></p><p>"Friends, please accept my bow!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Li Fan actually bowed to the various cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>The Cloudsea cultivators were stirred by this action.</p><p></p><p>Some accepted it calmly, as a matter of course.</p><p></p><p>However, many were simply there for the spectacle and paid little attention to Li Fan's gestures.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan stood upright, preparing to speak once more, suddenly, a streak of light emerged from the distant sky.</p><p></p><p>"Acting Island Lord of the Myriad Immortal Island, Li Fan, take heed!"</p><p></p><p>A slender cultivator in the standard attire of the Immortal Alliance, holding a scroll of yellow decree in hand, spoke solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Although his voice was not loud, it was as clear as thunder, reaching the ears of all the cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, silence enveloped the area around the city.</p><p></p><p>"There he is!" Li Fan casually flew forward, slightly bending his body.</p><p></p><p>"Hereby, Li Fan, the Acting Island Lord of Cloud Island, who has dedicated himself day and night to supervise the construction of Cloud City, is hereby commended."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>It was just like what he had seen yesterday at the First Prime Minister's residence.</p><p></p><p>However, this time, after the representative formally announced on behalf of the Myriad Immortal Alliance's Political Hall headquarters, the decree transformed into a golden radiance and flew towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>As it almost touched him, the golden glow turned into a fitted black Dao robe that automatically draped over him. The robe bore intricate golden patterns, exuding a noble aura.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the Secret Envoy!" As Li Fan put on the garment, a group of cultivators in the crowd, as if they had rehearsed beforehand, loudly cheered in unison.</p><p></p><p>Some quick-witted cultivators already understood that, like when Li Fan acted as the temporary Island Lord, this matter had probably been determined long ago.</p><p></p><p>Only this group was kept in the dark.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators who had previously remained indifferent to Li Fan's actions now showed regret on their faces.</p><p></p><p>To remedy this, after the crowd quieted down for a while, they also began to cheer.</p><p></p><p>"For the Secret Envoy!" After the second call, the cheers did not cease.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, even those who had kept silent and had not spoken were pressured to join in the chorus of cheers.</p>

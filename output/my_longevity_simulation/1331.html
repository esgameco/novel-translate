        <h1>Chapter 1331</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1320: The Beginning of Cultivating Immortality</p><p></p><p>As the pen moved like a dragon and snake, the wordless talisman disguised under various spells and deceptions had already been written down.</p><p></p><p>Its power had been greatly weakened, but it was just right for testing. </p><p></p><p>For the accuracy of the experiment, Li Fan also cut off a piece of his own flesh of the same size, as well as another lump of mortal flesh, to serve as a control group.</p><p></p><p>Under the shroud of the wordless talisman, the three pieces of flesh underwent completely different changes.</p><p></p><p>They were all suddenly enveloped by a shadow in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's flesh and the mortal flesh showed no difference. They had almost no resistance, as if struck down by a wave from the formless sea, and thus sank and disappeared from the world.</p><p></p><p>But that lump of immortal flesh...</p><p></p><p>Although it could not be exempted from the influence of the immortal words, it was like a small flat boat. No matter how towering the waves were, it rose and fell steadily, remaining afloat on the sea surface.</p><p></p><p>When the fluctuations of the wordless talisman finally dissipated, it showed almost no change compared to before the experiment.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of immortal flesh..." Li Fan's eyes flickered.  </p><p></p><p>Next, Li Fan conducted experiments with the immortal words like "chaos" and "solitude", and reached a preliminary conclusion.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because it had been infused with immortal spiritual power, immortal flesh had extremely strong "individuality" and "recovery" abilities. It was not that it was directly immune to the influence of immortal words, but rather that after being impacted and undergoing self-transformation, it recovered at an extremely fast speed.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, at first glance, it appeared unaffected by any words.</p><p></p><p>"Such toughness, such recovery speed..." From the perspective of immortal blood, Li Fan caught a glimpse of the true formidability of immortals, leaving him deeply shaken.</p><p></p><p>"The mere power of flesh and blood is tens of thousands of times stronger than the recovery ability of my soul empowered by the Infinite Ebb and Flow Method!"</p><p></p><p>"What is the driving force behind this recovery? There is not a shred of immortal spiritual power left in this lump of flesh. And in terms of pure tissue structure, it is no different from mortal flesh."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>With a flash of thought, the White Ring of Mortal Dust appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Pure flesh and blood does not possess life. Therefore, in the judgment of the Mortal Dust, the immortal flesh before him also fell into the category of "dead matter."</p><p></p><p>Under the radiant light, the flesh was instantly decomposed.</p><p></p><p>But to Li Fan's disappointment, no immortal spiritual power appeared.</p><p></p><p>Instead, there was a foul-smelling black gas.</p><p></p><p>Just a slight whiff of it caused Li Fan to feel dizzy and see all sorts of illusions flashing before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>His expression changed drastically, and Li Fan retreated, activating a formation to gather and collect the black gas.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the black gas itself had no destructive power, and Li Fan soon dealt with it cleanly.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the small black ball in the distant sky, Li Fan couldn't help but blink his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The foul stench that seemed capable of polluting even the soul still lingered in his nostrils.</p><p></p><p>"This black gas seems to be pure rot and decay."</p><p></p><p>"Interestingly, despite such strong vitality, this is the sight after decomposition."</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he restrained himself with great willpower at the critical moment.</p><p></p><p>"Next life, next life. There will be plenty of opportunities in the future..." Li Fan's current physical condition was no longer sufficient to support his further exploration of the secrets of immortals. He took a deep breath and calmed his turbulent emotions.</p><p></p><p>Although he could not yet unravel the mystery of immortal blood, it did not prevent Li Fan from continuing to develop its applications.</p><p></p><p>With a flash of light, the bronze immortal crane obtained from the Profound Immortal Boat appeared in Li Fan's palm.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal descent, all things return to nothingness!"</p><p></p><p>After some preparation, a miniaturized version of the great Nihility Formation appeared in the underground space beneath the lecture hall.</p><p></p><p>Within the formation, formless winds howled.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan threw the bronze crane into the center of the formation. In an instant, the raging wind blades struck the bronze crane relentlessly according to Li Fan's intentions.</p><p></p><p>As expected of a remnant immortal artifact from the apocalyptic calamity, although on a smaller scale, the Nihility Formation's power was not much diminished. It failed to leave many marks on the bronze crane.</p><p></p><p>Only the incessant formless winds kept blowing, like a giant hammer, continuously pounding and striking, slowly changing the shape of the bronze crane.</p><p></p><p>Time passed slowly, and after three days, a bronze skeleton appeared within the Nihility Formation.</p><p></p><p>Temporarily moving it out of the formation, Li Fan used golden origin force essence as a guide to attract a small lump of immortal flesh onto the bronze skeleton.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to its own nature, or sensing the same "immortal" aura on the bronze skeleton.</p><p></p><p>Upon encounter, the immortal flesh slowly settled onto the surface of the bronze bones.</p><p></p><p>The flesh surged and churned, as if trying to expand outward.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan seized the opportunity to infuse a cluster of origin force essence.</p><p></p><p>Although it was extremely difficult to fuse with immortal flesh, perhaps the two shared some commonality. Eventually, the flesh absorbed the golden essence like a sponge.</p><p></p><p>Nourished by the energy, the immortal flesh began to grow along the bronze bones.</p><p></p><p>Initially just a small lump the size of a fingertip, attached to the skull.</p><p></p><p>After a period of writhing and self-propagation, like a red tide, it flowed down from the head.</p><p></p><p>Fed by Li Fan's origin force essence, this accumulation of immortal flesh no longer produced the inexplicable murmurs and resentful whispers when approached. Instead, it felt like a creation under Li Fan's vast origin force web, even giving him a sense of being able to control it with his mind.</p><p></p><p>Continuously infusing origin force essence, the immortal flesh eventually covered the entire surface of the bronze skeleton.</p><p></p><p>But it did not further develop an outer skin.</p><p></p><p>The pure flesh accumulation in human form looked somewhat unsettling.</p><p></p><p>And as this combination became increasingly intimate, the entire flesh body gradually underwent a certain transformation.</p><p></p><p>However, as Li Fan gazed silently at this body, he always felt that something was missing.</p><p></p><p>"The soul is the master of the body. With a body but no soul, it remains merely an object..."</p><p></p><p>After observing for a long time, Li Fan gradually realized.</p><p></p><p>But the final and most crucial step, Li Fan hesitated to take action.</p><p></p><p>Not only because he lacked the key "immortal soul" ingredient.</p><p></p><p>More crucially, whenever this idea arose in his mind, a sense of impending danger also emerged.</p><p></p><p>"When dealing with the immortal realm, one must act with even greater caution. The finishing touch, one must be wary of the dragon breaking through the wall after being drawn..."</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Li Fan nodded slowly, formed hand seals, and temporarily sealed this body in the formation.</p><p></p><p>"Wait until I find a consciousness capable of fully withstanding immortal flesh without losing control."  Li Fan's mind flashed to the remains of Tian Yang and Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>"Eternal remembrance, everlasting through the ages. Able to resonate with the Dao, it should not be lost under the influence of immortal flesh."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Compared to the uncontrollable Mr. Bai, the simple-natured Tianyang seemed to be a more suitable candidate. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan personally went to the bottom of the Congyunhai.</p><p></p><p>After taking a look at Tianyang's dormant puppet body beneath the vein of the seabed, Li Fan did not disturb it. </p><p></p><p>Instead, he went to Tianyang's palace and retrieved his remains.</p><p></p><p>After attempting for a while but still failing to sense the eternal lingering thoughts attached to the remains through his own perception, Li Fan fiercely crushed the remains into powder.</p><p></p><p>He then controlled the dust, sprinkling and mixing it into the true immortal flesh body.</p><p></p><p>The remains were merely appearances; the eternal lingering thoughts would not dissipate due to their destruction.</p><p></p><p>After the addition of the eternal lingering thoughts, the true immortal flesh body also underwent a qualitative change. </p><p></p><p>Violent energy undulations emerged from the body, as if an invisible engraving knife was continuously carving it. Skin and hair gradually formed on the bare flesh.</p><p></p><p>The face that slowly appeared was exactly the same as Tianyang in his memory!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered, continuously setting up a great formation around to prevent the resurrected Tianyang from going berserk.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he incessantly generated source essence chains to bind the body in front of him.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan soon realized something was amiss. </p><p></p><p>Although it looked lifelike, there was still an essential difference from a true life.</p><p></p><p>Even just to make this puppet move was currently impossible to achieve.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly: "It seems I took it for granted. Life, especially when it comes to immortals, is apparently not something that can be so easily restored."</p><p></p><p>"However, it doesn't mean that this body is useless. Its core is Tianyang's eternal lingering thoughts. When Tianyang truly resurrects, he can control this flesh puppet."</p><p></p><p>"Although it has no spiritual power, with just its physical strength, it could probably suppress half of the Xuanhuang realm. Mortal arts, spells and divine abilities would be unable to harm it in the slightest."</p><p></p><p>"Even better, the puppet's flesh was nourished by source essences. Even after this round of growth, it would still be under my control..."</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Li Fan, the flesh puppet moved like a marionette, making various motions.</p><p></p><p>But due to the existence of Tianyang's eternal lingering thoughts, Li Fan clearly felt various frictions.</p><p></p><p>"It still needs the main body to control it more smoothly."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sealed the flesh immortal puppet again with a great formation.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the remaining chunk of true immortal flesh, Li Fan fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Source essences are after all just a lower substitute for immortal spiritual power. After being nourished by them, the true immortal flesh also seemed to have changed, falling in realm. Even though they originally came from the same source, generated from Kunqin's hands, they almost instantly became unrelated..."</p><p></p><p>"Moru Bin once said that source essences are harmful and useless. It seems his words are not false."</p><p></p><p>But only for ordinary people. Even if there were irreversible consequences after being tainted by source essences, Li Fan could eliminate them through Reversion.</p><p></p><p>So before finding the true transcendent method, Li Fan would definitely choose to exhaust all uses.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's not just source essences. The independent nature of true immortal flesh causes any power lower than immortal spiritual power to taint it, leading to its degradation..."</p><p></p><p>"Truly, there is a distinction between immortals and mortals," Li Fan sighed.</p><p></p><p>"If the lower realms don't work, perhaps he could try the same level, or even higher than immortals."</p><p></p><p>Among the means Li Fan could currently employ, true immortal talismans and immortal-level formations were barely at the same level as true immortal flesh.</p><p></p><p>And the true and false transformations of Reversion were above the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan began a new round of research.</p><p></p><p>But this time, the progress was not as smooth as before. After all, they were all transcendent existences. With Li Fan's current knowledge, it was difficult to make a breakthrough in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was very self-aware.</p><p></p><p>Instead of exhausting his main body on this, he created a simulated persona to conduct the research. Once there were any findings, the main body would immediately perceive them.</p><p></p><p>If the true immortal flesh underwent an uncontrollable mutation, the Fallen Dust would descend and dissolve it all.</p><p></p><p>That black gas smelled a bit, but as long as it was controlled and not leaked out, it should not cause any trouble.</p><p></p><p>On the way back to the edge of the Starry Sea, Li Fan pondered this attempt with the ancient talisman script.</p><p></p><p>"The retrogressive force of the ancient talisman script can generate flesh from remains."</p><p></p><p>"In the Xuanhuang realm, there are not only the remains of true immortals."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mind flashed to the remains of the Great Master in the ruins of the Primordial Sect beneath the great rift of Fuliang State.</p><p></p><p>In the last era's Immortal Formation Apocalypse, Dao Source State undoubtedly survived until the very end.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the other survivors, the place where the Great Master was seemed to have formed a separate black domain, cut off from the outside world. Even when Li Fan controlled the immortal formation, he could not glimpse the situation inside.</p><p></p><p>Even when the high walls finally collapsed and the Starry Sea was in turmoil, that black domain persisted, revealing the Great Master's immense power.</p><p></p><p>Absolutely above beings like the Lawgiver and Celestial Physician.</p><p></p><p>"Allowing his own remains to be scattered outside."</p><p></p><p>"Unmoved by the destruction of the Xuanhuang, unmoved by the descent of true immortals."</p><p></p><p>"Even when the high walls collapsed and existences that hunted true immortals outside the walls descended, he still did not move. The Great Master's state was definitely problematic."</p><p></p><p>"No matter how focused on enlightenment, when sensing a fatal threat, there would definitely be an instinctive reaction..."</p><p></p><p>It was based on such speculation that Li Fan thought to use the Great Master's flesh for an exploration.</p><p></p><p>However, there were still certain risks, so he would make arrangements only at the very end of this era.</p><p></p><p>As his thoughts surged, Li Fan had returned outside the Immortal Boat.</p><p></p><p>He sent the signal according to their previous agreement.</p><p></p><p>The elders of the Immortal Boat all came out to welcome him, giving him due respect.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist friend, why have you become like this?"</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan, who had separated from them not long ago but was now completely white-haired and even faintly exuding the aura of death, the Immortal Boat cultivators were greatly alarmed and hastily asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan directly snorted coldly with an unpleasant tone, as if interrogating them: "Your Immortal Boat has really done me in!"</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Boat cultivators looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean by that, Daoist friend?" Zhong Daozhong smiled bitterly.</p><p></p><p>"Surely you all have noticed that I do not have long to live!" Li Fan's expression was gloomy, his eyes containing killing intent as he scanned the Immortal Boat cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"And all of this is thanks to your Immortal Boat!"</p><p></p><p>Before the Immortal Boat cultivators could respond, Li Fan continued: "After returning, I reported the details to my master. But I waited and waited without any response."</p><p></p><p>"So I took the liberty of activating the realm-protecting immortal treasure to calculate what the future would be like cooperating with you..."</p><p></p><p>"Never expecting it would turn me into this state!"</p>

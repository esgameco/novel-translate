            <p>Gao Yuan was a bit skeptical, "The world knows that the Chief Secret Envoys possess various mystical methods of divination. If they want to accumulate wealth, what method can't they achieve? Why do they have to act like us and risk losing their identity?"</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing'ang" snorted when he saw their reactions, "The Chief's intentions, how can the two of you understand?"</p><p></p><p>"But well, in order to make you both convinced, I will reveal a bit more insider information."</p><p></p><p>He lowered his voice and whispered, "Not only did the Chief predict that the battle in Tianling Prefecture is about to end, he also saw that after the war, the Immortal Alliance issued an order for rest and recovery, to quickly recover. This order has been issued."</p><p></p><p>"What?" He Zhenghao and Gao Yuan's spirits shook, leaning in to listen.</p><p></p><p>They heard "Zhou Qing'ang" say slowly, "All Immortal Alliance cultivators can purchase martial arts from the Tianxuan Mirror at a discount."</p><p></p><p>"Although the prediction involves the Tianxuan Mirror, the result may have some margin of error. However, according to the Chief Secret Envoy, it's almost certain."</p><p></p><p>"Discounted martial arts purchases?" Both of them gasped upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>But upon careful consideration, there were precedents.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the last time such a thing happened was perhaps hundreds of years ago, as mentioned by some older cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that the contribution points required to purchase cultivation techniques are a significant part of a cultivator's lifetime contribution points expenditure. With tens of thousands or even over a hundred thousand contribution points required, it might not be a big deal for He Zhenghao and the others, but for the vast majority of cultivators, it would require a major effort to accumulate.</p><p></p><p>If the Immortal Alliance were to truly offer discounts on martial arts again, even if it were just a twenty percent discount, purchasing during this period would save a significant amount of contribution points.</p><p></p><p>It was easy to imagine how crazy the cultivators would become at that time. It is likely that even if they went around borrowing, they would gather enough contribution points to purchase martial arts.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, He Zhenghao's eyes lit up. He felt this was an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>However, the specific plan to capitalize on this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity was still a bit unclear in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Scratching his head, he felt a bit itchy inside.</p><p></p><p>Unable to contain himself, he said repeatedly, "Friend Zhou, don't beat around the bush. Please tell us in detail!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang smiled faintly, "It's simple! Firstly, spread the word that the great battle is coming to an end and everything will return to normal."</p><p></p><p>"Once this opportunity is gone, there won't be another chance. Those who want to use contribution points to secure a position must act quickly. There won't be such a good chance again in the future!"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, slightly raising the prices a bit is also very reasonable, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Secondly, announce the restart of the fundraising project. This time, the momentum should be even greater."</p><p></p><p>"Set a target of two hundred percent profit within five years, and gather contribution points with no limit!"</p><p></p><p>As the person who had always managed the fundraising projects, He Zhenghao's eyelids jumped when he heard this.</p><p></p><p>He believed that the Chief Secret Envoy could definitely achieve a two hundred percent profit within five years. Taking into account the results of the previous fundraising projects and Li Fan's identity as the head of the Feiyun City Secret Envoy, the fundraising project with no limit was sure to attract unimaginable contributions.</p><p></p><p>Especially those cultivators who had repeatedly wanted to participate in Li Fan's wealth-building plan but had yet to achieve their wishes for various reasons.</p><p></p><p>After hearing this news, they would surely rush to contribute their points immediately.</p><p></p><p>After all, five years was not that long, relatively speaking.</p><p></p><p>**Continued in the next message due to character limit**</p>

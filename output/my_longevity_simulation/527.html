            <p>"I refuse!"</p><p></p><p>"But I won't allow it. I don't want Senior Sister to be so lonely from now on!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's laughter echoed throughout the world.</p><p></p><p>"Over these years, Senior Sister has grasped the concept of ['Unity in Diversity']. Although I may be foolish, I have not been idle."</p><p></p><p>"I have a move, please teach me, Senior Sister!"</p><p></p><p>In a dazzling burst of light, Li Fan's voice, as solid as gold and stone, resounded.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>"Earth!"</p><p></p><p>"Unity!"</p><p></p><p>"Longevity!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's body completely dissipated into a bright light.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Senior Sister Zhao finally showed a slight change in her expression for the first time.</p><p></p><p>No longer indifferent and in control of everything, she now had a look of good humor and amusement. "No wonder you, Junior Brother, have been progressing slowly over the years. It turns out you've been preoccupied with trying to control me?"</p><p></p><p>"We both practice the 'Heaven and Earth Intertwining Technique', and in reality, we are already inseparable. This Heaven and Earth Unity technique can indeed pose a threat to me..."</p><p></p><p>"If only your cultivation could be higher."</p><p></p><p>Countless images of Senior Sister Zhao watched as numerous lights surged out from Li Fan's body, all of them opening their arms and letting the white light pour into their embrace.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, stop resisting, merge with me!"</p><p></p><p>On the numerous faces of her body, cracks began to appear.</p><p></p><p>But the cracks quickly repaired themselves. However, the white light grew dimmer and slowly disappeared into the sky.</p><p></p><p>When there was no longer any trace of Li Fan's presence within the Great Dao Sect...</p><p></p><p>Everything seemed to come to a standstill.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Junior Brother Li Fan."</p><p></p><p>"I must thank you for playing such an interesting game with me."</p><p></p><p>"It's been many years since I've had such a fun experience."</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Zhao's expression was dreamy as she looked at the sky, murmuring to herself.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>"Transcendent Fairy Light! It's the Transcendent Fairy Light!"</p><p></p><p>"Who is it? How come another cultivator from our Cang Hong Prefecture has caught the attention of Lord Tianzun so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, in just a month's time, three disciples from the Immortal sect have emerged! Cang Hong Prefecture is truly going to make a name for itself!"</p><p></p><p>The noisy voices seemed to come from a distance, and Li Fan suddenly woke up.</p><p></p><p>Looking around somewhat dazed, he found the environment he was in to be both familiar and unfamiliar.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, memories long sealed and separated like they belonged to another lifetime suddenly flooded back to him like a tide.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders Council, the One Heart Immortal Sect, Cang Hong Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Transcendent Fairy Light.</p><p></p><p>It turned out he was still in that moment where he was being guided by the fairy light.</p><p></p><p>But what was that experience that lasted for hundreds of years and felt so real about?</p><p></p><p>An illusion?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but look up.</p><p></p><p>Through the cracks in the sky, he could faintly see a sect nestled amid a range of mountains.</p><p></p><p>It was one of the ten ancient Immortal sects, the Great Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, seemingly welcoming the new member Li Fan's joining, countless disciples within the Great Dao Sect all lifted their heads to look in his direction.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the illusion he had seen, this Great Dao Sect had a lot more "vitality".</p><p></p><p>Not only were the expressions on each disciple's face no longer so rigid and lifeless, but they were varied, almost lifelike.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they were engaging in conversations with each other, discussing fervently.</p><p></p><p>It was unlike the silence and stillness he saw in the illusion.</p><p></p><p>Within the Transcendent Fairy Light, ascending continuously, Li Fan's body gradually became stiff and numb.</p><p></p><p>He also felt his consciousness slowly dissipating.</p><p></p><p>"So this is a wooden puppet..."</p><p></p><p>It dissipated with the wind.</p><p></p><p>Leaving behind only a dried-up wooden body heading towards the Great Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>The reactions of the disciples within the Great Dao Sect varied upon seeing this scene.</p><p></p><p>Some were furious.</p><p></p><p>Some seemed pensive.</p><p></p><p>Some clapped their hands in glee.</p><p></p><p>Some smiled.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Not a trace of the so-called ['Unity in Diversity'] could be seen, wonder where the 'unity' was.</p><p></p><p>It was unclear who eventually made the decision.</p><p></p><p>A white light emerged from the crack, completely obliterating the puppet's body.</p><p></p><p>Then, the Transcendent Fairy Light was retracted, the crack slowly closed, and the scene of the One Heart Immortal Sect disappeared into the void.</p><p></p><p>Leaving only the Five Elders Council cultivators who were unclear about the truth sighing to themselves.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Cloud Mist Sea.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, the original body inspecting the progress of rebuilding Cloud Mist Fairy City, stood stunned.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong, Lord Island Master? Is there something not right?"</p><p></p><p>"I'll have them correct it immediately!" High Yuan said repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Li Fan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing's wrong, you're doing well! Keep it up!"</p><p></p><p>Resuming his usual composure, he continued to inspect for a while and only returned to his temporary construction residence after a half day.</p><p></p><p>Sealing the surroundings, Li Fan looked solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Junior Brother, I'm really looking forward to officially meeting you."</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Zhao's light laughter seemed to still echo in his ears.</p><p></p><p>Was the final message relayed by a shred of divine consciousness or heard by Li Fan's true self?</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Zhao... What an illusion."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan reminisced about his experiences over a hundred years within the Great Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>Although some details were fuzzy, the vast majority felt akin to his own personal experiences, almost indistinguishable from reality.</p><p></p><p>It even led Li Fan to entertain the thought of formally meeting Senior Sister Zhao, believing he had been her junior brother and a member of the ancient Great Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but shudder inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Even with just a shred of divine consciousness immersed in the illusion crafted by Senior Sister Zhao, it had such a profound impact on his true self...</p><p></p><p>It was no wonder why the Five Elders Council cultivators within the ['Unity in Diversity'] Immortal sect were so devoted to Senior Sister Zhao.</p><p></p><p>Activating the Profound Yellow Heart Refinement Technique, he transformed the frequent urges of 'siding with Senior Sister Zhao' into nourishment for the reverse cultivation of his Dao Heart.</p><p></p><p>After three days and nights, Li Fan finally eliminated the influence from this visit to the One Heart Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>At least, on the surface, it appeared that way.</p><p></p><p>Completely freed, Li Fan began to analyze and organize the gains from this visit.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, his experiences in the Great Dao Sect were fabricated by Senior Sister Zhao.</p><p></p><p>Even from start to finish, Li Fan was unsure of Senior Sister Zhao's real name.</p><p></p><p>However, during the illusion, he never felt anything amiss.</p><p></p><p>Yet, in the midst of the illusion and reality, there was a mix of truth and falsehood.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, figures like Ji Changxi and Mo Zhiran, the Great Dao Sect cultivators within the illusion, had once truly existed.</p><p></p><p>The techniques like the 'Heaven and Earth Intertwining Technique' and 'Soul Severing Illumination Divine Art' might not be fake.</p><p></p><p>It was just unfortunate that, like his return from the Abyssal Immortal Realm, the details were hard to recall.</p><p></p><p>And the various worldly changes he experienced as Senior Sister Zhao's junior brother.</p><p></p><p>"Turns out the Immortal Mortal Plague was indeed the work of a certain Heavenly Venerable, not a natural evolution of the world."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought back to the scholar Yin from the Deep Jade Island.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he discovered the whereabouts of this hidden Heavenly Venerable and was eventually silenced?"</p>

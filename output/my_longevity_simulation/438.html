        <h1>Chapter 438</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Five Elders slowly lowered their voices, obviously lost in thought and speculation. After a while, they snapped back to reality and looked towards "Zhou Qing'ang."</p><p></p><p>"Although there are some minor flaws, overall, this time you've made a significant contribution by establishing a connection with the organization behind He Zhenghao," one of the Elder said.</p><p></p><p>He tossed a storage ring over. "Inside is the 'Devouring Heaven and Earth Grand Technique' you wanted, along with some Enlightenment Pills."</p><p></p><p>"In addition, there are fifty thousand contribution points of spiritual stones. Consider it a reward for your achievements this time." Li Fan took the storage ring and examined it, a look of joy on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Fifty thousand contribution points? How generous!" Li Fan exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>The Elder snorted, "If there is merit, there will be rewards. Next, while you continue to infiltrate, you must maintain your relationship with He Zhenghao."</p><p></p><p>"If possible, it would be best to extract some information about the mysterious organization behind him from his mouth," the Elder continued. "Of course, if that's not possible, there's no need to force it. Just establishing a connection with them and exchanging for secrets with spiritual stones should suffice."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you may go back now."</p><p></p><p>"You have been in contact quite frequently recently, so for the next period of time, it's better not to meet with He Zhenghao temporarily, to avoid exposing any flaws."</p><p></p><p>"If there are any special circumstances, we will contact you again."</p><p></p><p>After giving further instructions, the other party left the Orchid Island. Back on Taian Island, Li Fan's main body had been waiting for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Five hundred and fifty thousand contribution points, three bottles of Enlightenment Pills, the Devouring Heaven and Earth Grand Technique... This harvest is not bad," Li Fan murmured as he checked the items in both his main body's and clone's storage ring.</p><p></p><p>"With such a substantial number of contribution points, no matter what plans I have next, it should be much easier," he thought.</p><p></p><p>In just a glance, Li Fan shifted his focus away from the pile of spiritual stones. Once he reached a certain level, any additional stones were just a bunch of numbers to him. Moreover, for someone like Li Fan who could continuously reincarnate, the more cycles he went through, the more information he could gather, making it easier to acquire contribution points.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan began to read the "Devouring Heaven and Earth" Grand Technique in the storage ring, using his clone Zhou Qing'ang to examine the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>The style and content of this technique were quite different from the ones exchangeable in the Heavenly Profound Mirror of the Fangxian Alliance. It wasn't as concise and straightforward, but rather cryptic and difficult to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>"Distinct ancient style..." Li Fan noted.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, having practiced several ancient techniques before, it took him half a day to fully grasp it.</p><p></p><p>The Devouring Heaven and Earth Grand Technique was not a primary cultivation technique that could enhance one's cultivation level. It wasn't just a secret method to change the way cultivators absorbed spiritual energy. It functioned more like a magical skill, allowing the user to forcefully extract earth and spiritual energy to enhance their cultivation, as well as accelerating and promoting the cultivation of their primary cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>Typically, cultivators had limits to the amount of spiritual energy they could absorb. Upon reaching their limit, forcefully absorbing more energy could even lead to death. However, after practicing the Devouring Heaven and Earth Grand Technique, this concern was eliminated. The excess energy absorbed would become an accelerator for enhancing one's primary technique.</p><p></p><p>The more one absorbed, the faster their technique would operate. This cycle would continue until a breakthrough was achieved, enabling one to consume even more energy. However, the key was not to be discovered and be attacked.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, this method of cultivation, akin to a parasitic style, was more sinister than the newly introduced laws of the heavens. It could cause almost irreversible damage to the world in a short period, making it an enemy of all other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, for Li Fan, as long as it helped him advance in cultivation, he didn't care about being the enemy.</p><p></p><p>After carefully understanding it, Li Fan's clone Zhou Qing'ang tried to activate the Devouring Heaven and Earth Grand Technique. In an instant, his eyes turned red, and the world around him changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>There were no longer distinctions between people, scenery, and objects. Only the difference between delicious and not delicious remained. The clone looked at the main body for a while before looking down at the earth veins on Taian Island. The yellowish earth veins extended from beneath the island to the seabed, appearing delectable.</p><p></p><p>Placing his hands gently on the ground, a suction force emanated from his palms.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Li Fan was surprised when the earth vein energy did not get absorbed as expected, according to the technique's description. Even after confirming he did everything correctly, he tried again, this time increasing the suction force.</p><p></p><p>The earth's energy trembled but remained unyielding, seemingly connected and unaffected by his absorption attempts. As he continued to increase the pressure, Taian Island began to tremble.</p><p></p><p>If he continued, the disturbance would surely attract attention. However, the clone persisted relentlessly without any intention of stopping.</p><p></p><p>Until finally, Li Fan had to intervene and knocked Zhou Qing'ang unconscious to halt the turmoil that the Devouring Heaven and Earth Grand Technique caused.</p><p></p><p>"This Devouring Heaven and Earth Grand Technique is somewhat suspicious," Li Fan frowned slightly. The fact that his clone lost control was unexpected since their consciousness was supposed to be unified.</p><p></p><p>However, the desire for consumption influenced his clone's behavior. When the clone saw the main body, it even had a thought of devouring. While he managed to control it then, once the consumption was hindered and the desire unfulfilled, the clone lost control.</p><p></p><p>"It's no wonder its creator couldn't rein it in. It's not that he didn't want to; he simply couldn't," Li Fan sighed, feeling sorry that such a unique technique couldn't be utilized by him.</p><p></p><p>"Nevertheless, I need not dwell on it. I have the Mountain-Toppling Decision; the Devouring Heaven and Earth is just an embellishment. Besides, I can allow others to practice this method and reap rewards passively." </p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan put the technique aside for now. He gazed through the barriers and focused on the earth veins of Taian Island below.</p><p></p><p>"The ancient Mountain & River Great Formation had connected all the earth veins in the world. Even though it has been replaced by the Heavenly Elemental Birth Formation, the effect is still significant."</p><p></p><p>"Even if one wanted to devour heaven and earth, it wouldn't be as easy as in ancient times."</p><p></p><p>"The peerless ferocious technique from thousands of years ago, now seemed so useless due to the changes over time."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Five Elders easily handed it over to a building foundation spy."</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, Li Fan felt a twinge of regret.</p>

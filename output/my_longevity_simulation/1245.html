        <h1>Chapter 1245</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The golden cube shone brilliantly, and Li Ping's voice echoed for a long time in this absolutely dark little world. ‚ôô‚ôï‚ùª‚ûàÀ¢ƒß·ªÆ‚ìß.ùî†·µíÁà™üò≤‚úå</p><p></p><p>As the instinctive fear dissipated, what rose in Su Yuqing's heart was an irrepressible, extreme desire for what was sealed inside the golden cube. </p><p></p><p>Even the fetus in her womb felt the same.</p><p></p><p>"You and this little world's Dao, which is still in the process of awakening, can be called the same kind in a certain sense. You think that with the method passed down by the master, slowly refining and absorbing it may be equivalent to hundreds of years of bitter cultivation."</p><p></p><p>As Li Ping's voice sounded again, a mysterious and wonderful method also appeared in Su Yuqing's mind.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like a secret technique, or a formation. Or perhaps both. Extremely profound, even with Su Yuqing's comprehension, it was a bit difficult to understand.</p><p></p><p>"This realm has important significance to me and the entire Great Enlightenment. After you devour and refine the consciousness of this realm's Dao, you can take its place and possess supreme power within this small world. With you helping to watch over this place, I can rest assured."</p><p></p><p>Only when Li Ping said this did Su Yuqing suddenly realize.</p><p></p><p>Although it was a bitter task, Su Yuqing was originally a person with a serene temperament, without too many worldly desires. Moreover, cultivating here by transforming into the Dao was probably the fastest way for her to cultivate, and it would also greatly benefit her daughter.</p><p></p><p>"I will obey the master's order." Su Yuqing took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"Master Hu, I don't want to be here either! It's so dark here!" The young Daoist Liuli shook her head frantically.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping obviously would not indulge her.</p><p></p><p>Tapping Liuli's head with his finger, Li Ping said in a deep voice, "Light and darkness are originally two sides of the same entity. Without darkness, the existence of light would lose its meaning. And vice versa. As the Liuli Wisdom Fruit, cultivation is just an easy matter for you. But this is also your fatal flaw..."</p><p></p><p>Liuli listened with wide eyes, seeming to understand yet not quite. Her intuition told her that her somewhat frightening master was not lying.</p><p></p><p>"Fast advancement, but compared to human cultivators, there is a natural limit. To break through the limit, one is to understand the principle of [Liuli], and the other is to understand the principle of [Wisdom]. And you can gain insights on both here."</p><p></p><p>"You are the youngest among my few disciples, so naturally gifts will not be lacking."</p><p></p><p>Another source of light appeared in Li Ping's hand. It was not a seal like the previous golden cube, but a pure condensation of energy.</p><p></p><p>The young Daoist Liuli subconsciously licked her lips, feeling that the moment she saw this ball of light, her stomach became hungry.</p><p></p><p>She reached out to try to grab it, but that ball of light was illusory, not entering her palm. Liuli was extremely frustrated, waving her hands incessantly, but it was ultimately futile.</p><p></p><p>The ultimate delicacy was in front of her, but she could only look and not eat. Liuli was on the verge of crying from the grievance.</p><p></p><p>"Lion Tiger..." Liuli looked up at Li Ping with pleading eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping smiled, "On this quintessence of source power, I have attached two layers of restrictions. Only when you have a breakthrough in either wisdom or liuli, will the restrictions be lifted."</p><p></p><p>"And when you break through your limits, this energy will also help you thoroughly stabilize your new form after the transformation."</p><p></p><p>The young Daoist Liuli stared intently at the source power quintessence, nodding vigorously.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao is not benevolent, treating all things as straw dogs. When you control this realm, you should take the word 'natural' as the guiding principle. One should be aloof, and it's best not to personally intervene in the various happenings among the mundane lives, unless absolutely necessary."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's voice did not cease for a long time, and his figure had already suddenly shattered and disappeared from this realm.</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing recalled her master's usual performance in front of the people of the Great Enlightenment, and couldn't help but ponder.</p><p></p><p>"The Youzu people?" Su Yuqing began to examine the various information transmitted by her master in her mind.</p><p></p><p>As for the young Daoist Liuli, she was constantly observing left and right, eager to find where the way to break through the limits mentioned by her master was.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba had now returned to the underground of Yueyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling was also with him.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling played with the wheel gifted by Li Ping in her hands, seeming a bit absent-minded about the task of subduing the ancient tree of the earth veins on this trip.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister, can we start now?" Wang Xuanba was a bit intimidated by this serious junior sister and asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"No hurry, wait a bit longer." Lin Ling shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"Wait? Wait for what?" Wang Xuanba was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>In his perception, quite a few of the sixteen groups of insect swarms lurking had already awakened from their seals and were getting restless.</p><p></p><p>"Master said to give it a chance. If it remains obstinate, it won't be too late to take action then." Lin Ling frowned but still patiently explained.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's listen to Junior Sister." Wang Xuanba said with a grin.</p><p></p><p>The two stood still in the earth veins for a short half-day. Suddenly, Wang Xuanba once again felt that vast consciousness belonging to the ancient tree of the earth veins sweeping past him.</p><p></p><p>But unlike before, this time the ancient tree of the earth veins did not directly ignore them, but lingered for a long time, unwilling to leave.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba noticed Lin Ling putting away the wheel in her hand, her expression becoming solemn.</p><p></p><p>She seemed to be conversing with someone about something.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba did not disturb the conversation between the two, but in fact, his heartstrings had long been taut. As long as Lin Ling conveyed a single thought, he would cooperate and mobilize all the Dao-level insect swarms.</p><p></p><p>At first, Lin Ling seemed to be just chatting normally with the ancient tree of the earth veins. There was even a hint of a smile on her face from time to time.</p><p></p><p>But without any sign, Lin Ling's expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>She rebuked coldly, "Considering that you are of the same race as me, I opened my heart to communicate with you just now. But why are you making wild statements, persuading me to rebel?!"</p><p></p><p>"My master's methods, how could a small, decaying ancient tree like you fathom them!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba received Lin Ling's telepathic message and also let out a cold laugh. He then awakened the dormant insect swarms under Yueyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The black shadows were like floodwater after a dike breach, unstoppable and rushing thousands of miles.</p><p></p><p>Visibly, the surrounding yellow earth vein currents were instantly dyed black. A sharp explosive sound faintly came from underground, but it was drowned out by the surging army of insect swarms.</p><p></p><p>"How does it feel to lose a tentacle?" Lin Ling's eyes flashed with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"Severing thousands of your tentacles is also an easy matter for me."</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba understood and cooperated by awakening the remaining fifteen groups of insect swarms, but still controlled them as a deterrent.</p><p></p><p>The phantom of a hunchbacked old man appeared in front of Wang Xuanba and Lin Ling.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Lin Ling, his face showing horror. At the same time, there was also a hint of anger in his tone as he questioned, "I was sincerely well-intentioned, why did you harm me?!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba looked at this rather unseemly little old man in front of him, finding it hard to associate him with the legendary ancient tree that controlled the earth veins of the Xuan-Huang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Facing the accusation from the ancient tree of the earth veins, Lin Ling just sneered, "Good intentions? I have only followed my master for a few years, not only successfully taking form from an ignorant and weak consciousness, but also possessing this impressive</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your cultivation." </p><p></p><p>"How long have you been cultivating? If I wanted to kill you, it would only take a single thought!" Lin Ling coldly locked her gaze on the Earth Vein Ancient Tree, as the Dharma Wheel suddenly appeared behind her, spinning incessantly.</p><p></p><p>The insect swarms within the earth veins seemed to sense something, responding in unison with an uprising. Even though they hadn't collectively broken free from the seal, the fifteen shadowy masses suddenly grew larger.</p><p></p><p>"Let's talk this out, let's talk this out properly." The hunched old man was in a fluster.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Ling ignored him and continued to press aggressively, "Your mother tree is not my mother tree. What you call abandoning the darkness for the light, in my eyes, is destroying my Dao path!"</p><p></p><p>"Those who obstruct the Dao shall not rest until they are dead!" Lin Ling let out a furious shout. </p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba chuckled and cooperated by loosening the restraints on a mass of insects.</p><p></p><p>The Earth Vein Ancient Tree's face changed drastically. Before it could speak, one of its legs seemed to suddenly snap as if hit by someone. Its entire figure lost balance and stumbled to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"A misunderstanding! It's truly a misunderstanding! The Mother Tree is the source of all life in the world. Not to mention us spirit woods, even humans..."</p><p></p><p>Before the Earth Vein Ancient Tree could finish, it was interrupted again by the eruption of another insect swarm. This time it was the other leg. The hunchbacked old man raised his head in distress, his panic evident in his words.</p><p></p><p>"The source of all living beings in the world? Where is it now?" Lin Ling's words were full of disdain. </p><p></p><p>"Even if what you say is true, so what?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling stepped forward, walking in front of the Earth Vein Ancient Tree.</p><p></p><p>"Compared to my master..."</p><p></p><p>"You're nothing but a stray dog!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling stomped hard on the Earth Vein Ancient Tree.</p><p></p><p>The illusory old man let out a wail. Although some of its body had been eroded by the Dao-One insects, even with its remaining strength, it shouldn't have been completely powerless to resist. But the Earth Vein Ancient Tree did not struggle.</p><p></p><p>Because the old tree knew that what this young fellow spirit wood said was not wrong.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell are these things..." The Earth Vein Ancient Tree appeared to have completely submitted on the surface, but was actually secretly trying to resolve this strange black energy.</p><p></p><p>But this power seemed different from anything it had known in the Xuanhuang Realm, leaving it at a complete loss.</p><p></p><p>"If a few disciples have such means, who exactly is their master? Could it be some ancient powerful being? We have no grudges, so why would they suddenly target me? Could it be to go against..."  The Earth Vein Ancient Tree was filled with doubts as countless thoughts flashed through its mind.</p><p></p><p>"A wise man submits to circumstances. Considering that we are both spirit woods, I'll give you a chance. Pledge allegiance to our Great Enlightenment Holy Dynasty!"</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, I don't mind taking over your position as the Earth Vein Ancient Tree, even if I have to go out of my way to do it!" Lin Ling said coldly, her killing intent chilling.</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, green roots extended from under her feet, surging into the black insect swarm like countless tentacles. </p><p></p><p>Pure green spread from Lin Ling's lower body, quickly dyeing the black into green.</p><p></p><p>Having taken control of the imitation beast Dharma Wheel, Lin Ling was now one with the insect swarm. She was the swarm, and the swarm was her.</p><p></p><p>Wherever the black Dao-One insect flood passed, it became a part of her body, reaching as far as her will.</p><p></p><p>If the Earth Vein Ancient Tree previously had a chance to reclaim the parts of its body invaded by the Dao-One insects by finding a way to exterminate them and then constantly washing with the power of earth veins...</p><p></p><p>Now, the part occupied by Lin Ling...</p><p></p><p>The Earth Vein Ancient Tree's face slowly turned extremely pale. </p><p></p><p>Because it had completely lost perception of that part of its own body. It even sensed that right next to its original body, there was now a malicious existence.</p><p></p><p>That could swallow up its remaining part at any moment!</p><p></p><p>This feeling was truly bone-chilling, further proving that Lin Ling's words were not empty threats.</p><p></p><p>There wasn't much time left...</p><p></p><p>This thought flashed through the Earth Vein Ancient Tree's mind.</p><p></p><p>But pledging allegiance to this so-called Great Enlightenment Holy Dynasty meant betraying its own father.</p><p></p><p>The sinister face of Ruomu suddenly appeared before the Earth Vein Ancient Tree, causing it to shudder involuntarily. </p><p></p><p>The original intention to surrender instantly vanished again.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Earth Vein Ancient Tree was hesitating, unable to decide, it vaguely sensed a bit of special intent from Lin Ling.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>After carefully pondering for a moment and recalling how Ruomu seemed to be getting a bit crazy recently, the Earth Vein Ancient Tree finally made a decision.</p><p></p><p>"This old one..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling glanced over slightly, and the Earth Vein Ancient Tree paused, changing its words, "I am willing to submit to the Holy Dynasty."</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba looked at the ancient tree with some suspicion. Lin Ling then ordered, "Then come with us to meet our master."</p><p></p><p>Leaving no room for refusal.</p><p></p><p>Its body changed from illusory to real as it appeared in a rather disheveled state.</p><p></p><p>Obediently following behind Wang Xuanba and Lin Ling.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, there were no mishaps as they arrived in the Great Enlightenment small world. </p><p></p><p>The unfathomable auras coming from all directions made the ancient tree feel like it was treading on thin ice, trembling with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>The two disciples alone could subdue it completely, let alone the Great Enlightenment Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Holy Emperor's seat, the ancient tree's submission naturally went without saying.</p><p></p><p>Besides falling into the Holy Emperor's golden web of origin power, losing freedom of body and mind, and becoming a slave of Great Enlightenment, the Earth Vein Ancient Tree also divulged everything it knew about Ruomu.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, it managed to preserve its own life.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Dynasty also officially gained the method to find Ruomu's true body.</p><p></p><p>"Your Holiness, I have revealed my father's aura today. He will definitely sense it before long. So the key to success lies in 'speed'." Having chosen to surrender, the Earth Vein Ancient Tree took the initiative to strategize for Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>"You're right. That's why I'm already on my way."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's voice came from above, but what left the Earth Vein Ancient Tree in utter shock was that the figure of the faceless Holy Emperor was slowly fading and disappearing.</p><p></p><p>And it couldn't even perceive when the other party had left.</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Emperor's power is indeed unfathomable. Even surpassing Father..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, that old madman is in for it now."</p><p></p><p>For some reason, the Earth Vein Ancient Tree started to feel a bit of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, outside the Holy Emperor's seat,</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba looked at Lin Ling, wanting to say something but hesitating.</p><p></p><p>"Just say what's on your mind. If you keep staring at me like that, I'm afraid I won't be able to resist drawing my sword."</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling's sudden words startled Wang Xuanba.</p><p></p><p>Scratching his head, Wang Xuanba looked at his junior sister. No longer hesitating, he asked, "Just now, at the critical moment of persuading the Earth Vein Ancient Tree to surrender, junior sister seemed to say something to it?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling showed a look of disdain as if to say "what a boring question".</p><p></p><p>"I merely told it that if it surrendered, I could form an alliance with it, that's all."</p>

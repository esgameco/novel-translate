            <p>Chapter 1042: Enlightenment on the New Law of World Destruction</p><p></p><p>If the impact on his body was still within expectations, the changes in the Five Elements Great Heavenly Caves under the influence of the Yin force greatly surprised Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The originally distinct and non-interfering five heavenly caves actually showed a subtle trend of merging with each other.</p><p></p><p>A roaring sound like a dragon's cry appeared in the heavenly caves, and the speed of the five elements circulation almost doubled during the constant tremors.</p><p></p><p>Although the overall strength did not increase much, the already astonishing endurance and resilience had breakthroughs again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense locked onto the Changyue Yin Jade in his arms, his expression changing inexplicably.</p><p></p><p>"The interaction of heaven and earth, the harmony of Yin and Yang. The Heavenly Profound Mirror indeed did not deceive me, this was indeed the area I was lacking in before."</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's wandering thoughts quickly settled down: "It can only add flowers to the brocade, not send charcoal in snowy weather."</p><p></p><p>"No matter how much the Five Elements Great Heavenly Caves are enhanced, there is a limit. To directly face immortal cultivators, breakthroughs in great realms are still needed."</p><p></p><p>Having gained benefits, Li Fan no longer continued wasting time with the Heavenly Profound Mirror clone, directly asking about the next step of action.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Profound Mirror clone pondered: "The Immortal Alliance's internal plan to seal spirits has been roughly drafted. However, based on past experience, it will take a considerable amount of time from drafting to formal implementation."</p><p></p><p>"Unless there are unexpected incidents that can stimulate it."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, the Heavenly Profound Mirror clone secretly transmitted a piece of content.</p><p></p><p>After listening, Li Fan couldn't help but give a thumbs up to the Heavenly Profound Mirror clone.</p><p></p><p>"I will have my sect brothers go handle it right away, surely giving the Myriad Immortals Alliance a big surprise."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan left in a hurry, transforming into a rainbow.</p><p></p><p>Everything that had been still in the city started flowing again. Before long, suggestive moaning sounds arose from the room.</p><p></p><p>After the hidden heavenly cave saw Mo Rubin and conveyed the Heavenly Profound Mirror clone's plan, Li Fan finally returned to the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the underground secret chamber, the split soul solemnly suppressed the Book of Tribulation Crossing.</p><p></p><p>Of course, relying solely on the power of the split soul was inadequate.</p><p></p><p>However, with the newly laid down Dharma transmission restrictions and the combined force of the overall grand formation of the Spirit Wood Realm, it could steadily suppress it.</p><p></p><p>"Crossing Tribulation Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the book in front of him that kept flashing profound yellow silhouettes, and once again split off a wisp of divine sense, floating into the Book of Tribulation Crossing.</p><p></p><p>This time, due to the completion of the restrictions, Li Fan did not enter that bizarre courtyard through the stone steps in the mountains.</p><p></p><p>Instead, yellowed paper sheets surrounded Li Fan like screens of light filling the sky.</p><p></p><p>On the light screens, faint and blurry images could vaguely be seen.</p><p></p><p>Only rough scenes could be made out, not the details.</p><p></p><p>"It seems one must be a true disciple of the Crossing Tribulation Sect."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly and exited the Book of Tribulation Crossing.</p><p></p><p>However, the Book of Tribulation Crossing had one convenient aspect that the Heavenly Profound Mirror could not compare to.</p><p></p><p>That is, the paper men of the Crossing Tribulation Sect were truly rooted in the Profound Yellow Realm and deeply embedded in the world's veins.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when facing the Dharma transmitter Jiang, Li Fan had tried the "No" Mantra.</p><p></p><p>He originally thought it would stir up a bloody storm in the Profound Yellow Realm, but it was easily quelled by the Dharma transmitter Jiang.</p><p></p><p>Later he learned it was because there was the "Return to Origin" power of Gui Xu that could continuously dilute and eventually completely eliminate the impact brought by the "No" Mantra through constant backtracking.</p><p></p><p>Through the previous setback, Li Fan...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>And he learned the correct method of using the "Mei" character secret. Only by first eroding the Xuanhuang realm as much as possible, and then erupting together, can it become incurable and beyond treatment.</p><p></p><p>However, there was indeed some risk in secretly spreading the "Mei" character secret in the Xuanhuang realm. A powerful being might emerge from some corner to stop Li Fan's crazy behavior.</p><p></p><p>With the Book of Crossing Calamity, the densely packed paper men scattered throughout the Xuanhuang realm became the best tool for spreading the infection!</p><p></p><p>"By just corrupting the Book of Crossing Calamity, the gray mold can instantly infect most places in the Xuanhuang realm through the countless paper men. By then, even true immortals will be powerless to reverse it!"</p><p></p><p>A glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>If the Xuanhuang realm was considered a giant, then the paper men of the Crossing Calamity Sect were like a neural network implanted later and spread throughout the body.</p><p></p><p>And the "Mei" character secret was like a deadly poison that could rapidly spread throughout the body through it.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan might not actually do this, he nevertheless grasped another means of world destruction besides mobilizing the immortals of the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, this method of world destruction is not like the instant annihilation of the true immortals' glance. There is a process of slowly moving towards destruction. In order to save themselves, perhaps the hidden cards of the Myriad Immortal Alliance and the Five Elders, including all the hidden figures who care about Xuanhuang, will all be exposed."</p><p></p><p>Thoughts surged, and Li Fan's emotionless cold eyes fell on the Book of Crossing Calamity: "Crossing Calamity Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"Well done!"</p><p></p><p>Having figured out the ultimate use of the Book of Crossing Calamity, Li Fan did not leave the underground chamber.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he continued to study this only legacy of the Crossing Calamity Sect.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was very interested in the Crossing Calamity Sect's method of taking root in various parts of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was in seclusion studying, the Myriad Immortal Alliance quietly stirred up no small ripples, causing the alliance's high-level figures to collectively tremble.</p><p></p><p>The cause of the matter was a Golden Core cultivator who mysteriously died in the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>This person had been cultivating in an awakened state in the Tianxuan Mirror space until his contribution points were exhausted and he was expelled by the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Only then was his corpse exposed to everyone.</p><p></p><p>Because he had been dead for some time, the phenomenon of a cultivator falling from the sky did not appear to indicate the cause of death.</p><p></p><p>After some investigation, it was hastily concluded as "cultivation deviation" and left unsettled.</p><p></p><p>Who knew this was just the first incident. In the next two months, there were multiple reports of cultivators in various parts of the alliance encountering various accidents while cultivating in the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Some had illusions in their minds, not only forcing them to stop cultivating but also suffering serious injuries.</p><p></p><p>Some even died on the spot.</p><p></p><p>If the Myriad Immortal Alliance could barely accept the death of a couple cultivators,</p><p></p><p>then the subsequent anomalies of the Tianxuan Mirror made the entire alliance panic.</p><p></p><p>Because the trading function of the Tianxuan Mirror also seemed to have some problems.</p><p></p><p>Not only would there be a certain probability of errors in the settlement of contribution points during the trading process, the contribution points originally held by cultivators could also be directly cleared due to erroneous settlement.</p><p></p><p>Chaos was spreading, and the various functions of the Tianxuan Mirror seemed to be gradually affected.</p><p></p><p>After a careful investigation, the alliance finally determined that these anomalies were all caused by attacks on the Tianxuan Mirror by villains.</p><p></p><p>However, the Tianxuan Mirror was after all an immortal artifact-level existence with a powerful self-repair function.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, all these chaos would eventually disappear on their own.</p>

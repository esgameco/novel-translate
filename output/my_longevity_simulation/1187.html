        <h1>Chapter 1187</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After hearing the elder's request, the three cultivators were all slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Gou, this doesn't comply with the rules..." </p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Upon hearing this, the elder instantly gave them a cold look.</p><p></p><p>The three could only swallow their words back.</p><p></p><p>The situation was stronger than the people. The senior cultivator cupped his hands and tied the artifact before leaving the valley.</p><p></p><p>On the road.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhao, the Immortal Boat laws clearly state that after collecting the World-Destroying Artifacts, they must be handed over to the [Immortal Pivot Court]. Those who violate this law shall be treated as traitors. Now he instead wants us to deliver it to the Severed Immortal Tower..."</p><p></p><p>"Exactly, who on the Immortal Boat doesn't know that the Severed Immortal Tower and Immortal Pivot Court are at odds now. That old thing wants to curry favor with the Severed Immortal Tower, not doing it himself but just ordering us around. When something happens, we definitely won't be able to escape."</p><p></p><p>The senior cultivator, who was called Brother Zhao by the other two, also had an unpleasant expression, but he didn't join in the complaints. Instead, he signaled with his eyes for the two to shut up. </p><p></p><p>Afterwards, who knows what he secretly transmitted, but the two then honestly settled down.</p><p></p><p>The three didn't fly through the air, but walked out of the valley step by step along the small path.</p><p></p><p>The scenery in front of them suddenly changed, as if they had returned to the starry void.</p><p></p><p>However, this void before their eyes was not as cold and deathly silent as the dark starry sea outside.</p><p></p><p>A warm breeze seemed to blow from the void, bringing vigorous vitality.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, flickering seven-colored star points could be seen from time to time.</p><p></p><p>In contrast to this harmonious and warm scene was a bizarre picture: a towering giant standing in the void.</p><p></p><p>Eyes tightly closed, body withered, like a zombie that had been dead for a long time.</p><p></p><p>But his chest kept rising and falling, breathing out warm winds in all directions.</p><p></p><p>If it was just a dying giant, it would be fine. But what was horrifying was that a thick tree branch extended out of the giant's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Growing tenaciously upwards, forming a lush canopy.</p><p></p><p>Looking carefully, the giant's whole body was penetrated by branches. Moreover, the giant's lower body had already turned into dense, intertwined, thread-like tree roots.</p><p></p><p>Swaying with the wind from time to time, like a living thing.</p><p></p><p>This bizarre scene, it was unknown whether the tree was parasitic on the man, or the man had turned into a tree.</p><p></p><p>The three were long used to this scene and just sighed, "Looks like this [Pursuing Dao] giant is almost done for. Who knows what else the Immortal Pivot Court can come up with next."</p><p></p><p>"The Severed Immortal Tower talks better than it sings, about thoroughly solving the Immortal Boat's energy problems. They've been saying it for so long, but we have yet to see any effective results."</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait and see. It's said that this time there really has been a revolutionary breakthrough, otherwise that dog elder wouldn't suddenly show such goodwill."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The few people chatted idly, one sentence here, one there.</p><p></p><p>When they left the valley and flew into the void, a streak of green suddenly appeared under their feet, forming an aerial road leading to other places.</p><p></p><p>No need to fly, this green road itself was moving rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Like the surrounding stars, the floating continents were distributed all over.</p><p></p><p>The giant parasitized by the strange tree in the void.</p><p></p><p>From the giant tree, countless green thread-like roads extended, appearing and disappearing, connecting the various continents.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan hid his divine sense in the [World-Destroying Artifact], secretly spying on all this.</p><p></p><p>This cultivation civilization form that was completely different from the Xuanhuang Realm made him quite interested.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Boat..."</p><p></p><p>The following is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"The ancient ancestor of the Medicine King Sect, Sun Piaomiao, once traveled beyond the heavens and recorded the Dao markers of eighteen immortal realms. Among them was a huge spaceship that wandered indefinitely in the void, trading between various realms. It was a world of its own, named Xuan Shang."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if it has anything to do with this immortal ship."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then looked at the giant whose energy was constantly being extracted and spreading vitality around: "The Zhu Dao clan?"</p><p></p><p>The green, formless Dao path transferred at an extremely fast speed in the void. It didn't take long for Zhao and the other cultivators to arrive at the so-called Duan Xian Lou.</p><p></p><p>It was a dark golden spherical light.</p><p></p><p>Upon closer inspection, it was surprisingly built on the remains of a giant.</p><p></p><p>However, this time it was not a complete corpse, but a single, enormous skull.</p><p></p><p>What shocked Li Fan's mind was that in the center of this skull, there was actually an eyeball!</p><p></p><p>The eyeball did not lose its vitality with the death of the skull.</p><p></p><p>It was just tightly closed, still constantly rotating slightly.</p><p></p><p>An inexplicable sense of crisis arose in his heart. Li Fan decisively escaped from the possessed world-destroying relic.</p><p></p><p>He just stayed in the void and did not follow the three people into Duan Xian Lou.</p><p></p><p>His judgment was correct.</p><p></p><p>The huge eyeball suddenly opened, scanning around. After not finding anything unusual, it closed again.</p><p></p><p>Only then were Zhao and the other two cultivators able to enter Duan Xian Lou.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense did not continue to stare at the three-eyed skull, but waited patiently for their return in the void outside Duan Xian Lou.</p><p></p><p>"Dark golden skull, three eyes."</p><p></p><p>"It looks very similar to the one I discovered with the 'Mo' character formula. It's just that the one in this immortal ship..."</p><p></p><p>Bigger doesn't necessarily mean stronger.</p><p></p><p>The dark golden three-eyed skull Li Fan encountered before, even though the third eyeball was gone and it had purely become a breeding ground for the gray mold of the 'Mo' character formula, still gave Li Fan an extremely dangerous feeling. It seemed like it could come back to life at any time. So Li Fan had always sealed it with the seven-colored divine light and didn't dare to recklessly study it.</p><p></p><p>Although the three-eyed skull in front of him was even more gigantic, and even the eyeballs were still alive.</p><p></p><p>But the feeling Li Fan got was that it had completely died and had no chance of revival.</p><p></p><p>This was a mysterious and profound intuition.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't encountered many things outside the Xuanhuang Realm in the reincarnation, but since coming here, I've almost run into all of them."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that this immortal ship indeed has some tricks up its sleeve."</p><p></p><p>"Without complete world resources, it must obtain what it needs for survival from the dark starry sea and make the most of everything. It seems that the foundation of this immortal ship may far exceed my imagination..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts surged, and he kept scheming in his heart, trying to find a breakthrough point.</p><p></p><p>From the conversation of the three cultivators just now, he learned that the immortal ship seemed to have recently fallen into a power struggle between the Xian Shu Yuan and Duan Xian Lou.</p><p></p><p>This situation was exactly what Li Fan, an outsider, was happy to see.</p><p></p><p>"Only in muddy waters can one fish. Find a way to make this immortal ship more chaotic."</p><p></p><p>Before long, the three cultivators led by Zhao walked out of Duan Xian Lou.</p><p></p><p>In stark contrast to their previous indignation, this time they all had joyful expressions and barely contained excitement in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the green, formless Dao path, they only started to discuss enthusiastically when they reached the center of the void.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect Duan Xian Lou to really find a way to utilize the power of world destruction!"</p><p></p><p>"There are endless relics in the void. We really don't have to worry about energy depletion anymore!"</p>

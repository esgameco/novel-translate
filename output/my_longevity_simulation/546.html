        <h1>Chapter 546</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In his subconscious mind, he believed that his own image was frozen in the appearance of a thin and weak scholar at the age of 20.</p><p></p><p>After all, no matter how his appearance aged, once he activated the "True Return."</p><p></p><p>When he returned to the anchor point, he would still have this appearance.</p><p></p><p>So for Li Fan, aging was actually a pseudo proposition.</p><p></p><p>In this world, all creatures fear greatly: old age, sickness, death; but for him, they are just states that can be overcome at any time.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the changes happening on himself, Li Fan had a certain degree of "indifference."</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the myriad beings in this mysterious yellow world.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong, Dao Xuanzi, He Zhenghao, Zhang Zhiliang, Xiao Heng...</p><p></p><p>In each lifetime, their destinies would change with Li Fanâ€™s actions.</p><p></p><p>The mortal enemy who fought to the death in the previous life could become a close friend toasting wine in the next life.</p><p></p><p>In the following life, maybe they would become Li Fan's loyal subordinates.</p><p></p><p>And beyond that?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps they would become a path of innocent souls affected in the process of Li Fan fighting with others through magic.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>No matter what they encountered, once Li Fan activated the "True Return," their "state" would return to the anchor time chosen by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>So, for them, were the experiences of life after life some kind of illusion in another sense?</p><p></p><p>When mocking some extremely selfish people, people often like to say things like, "The world does not revolve around you, why should others make way for you everywhere."</p><p></p><p>But for Li Fan, the world, at least the mysterious yellow world he was in, actually revolved around him.</p><p></p><p>With a single thought, the world resets.</p><p></p><p>The past turns into smoke and fades away.</p><p></p><p>In such a situation, how could Li Fan regard the people in this world as being on the same level as himself?</p><p></p><p>Even though it could only be achieved through the help of the magical treasure "True Return," Li Fan, who could reverse time, indeed could not treat the beings of the mysterious yellow world as his "kind."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully examined himself in the mirror for a long time but did not find that kind of "silence" that Gao Yuan mentioned.</p><p></p><p>This may indicate that even Li Fan himself had not noticed the subtle changes happening in himself.</p><p></p><p>Just like the steadily increasing "psychological age" that continued to grow even with each "True Return."</p><p></p><p>In fact, Li Fan was not as unchanging as he thought himself to always be.</p><p></p><p>"Even I thought my acting skills were superb..." Li Fan self-deprecatingly said.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes for a moment, and when he opened them again, there seemed to be a subtle change in his gaze.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to become more agile, vivid, with a hint of love for everything around him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to observe carefully, adjusting continuously.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he finally stopped his movements.</p><p></p><p>"I've temporarily changed."</p><p></p><p>"However, acting is after all acting. No matter how similar it may seem, it's not real."</p><p></p><p>"In this world, there are too many people with unimaginable abilities. Even an ordinary guard like Sen Yunhai has such keen perception."</p><p></p><p>"To deceive everyone in the world, at present, seems impossible."</p><p></p><p>"However, it's not a big deal. There are also people in the world who are resolute and fierce."</p><p></p><p>As for this little episode, Li Fan just made some adjustments to himself and did not take it too seriously.</p><p></p><p>And the speculation by Gao Yuan and the others that Li Fan might have fallen from the realm of the Longevity Celestial made him feel a bit amused.</p><p></p><p>"I actually don't have any deep intentions. I just wanted to find an excuse to avoid the possible outbreak of the Tianlingzhou Great War in the future."</p><p></p><p>Alone, Li Fan quietly left Ten Thousand Immortal Island and dove into the seabed.</p><p></p><p>He went deep down to tens of thousands of meters under the sea trench to ensure that no one could follow him.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan activate the "Mystical Transformation of Qi and Spirit" and restored his original appearance.</p><p></p><p>Since entering the world with the identity of an "Ancient Tianji Sect cultivator," he temporarily buried all the items he obtained from the Immortal Alliance, concealing and sealing them with the technique "Conceal the Sky with One Hand."</p><p></p><p>Naked, Li Fan transformed his clothing and returned to the surface.</p><p></p><p>He borrowed a set of fitting clothes on a nearby mortal island, then headed straight to the island where the Imperial Court and the others were.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he arrived at his destination.</p><p></p><p>"What brings you here, fellow Daoist?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stopped, hovering in the air, and smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>He simply replied with the word "Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, Xiao Qing flew out personally to welcome him.</p><p></p><p>After observing Li Fan for a while, she then led him into a secret room on the island.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Li Chenfeng was not on the island and his restraining technique had temporarily lost its effect.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan replayed the scene recorded in his memory of the transformation stone in his head and found out that he had left the mysterious yellow world.</p><p></p><p>But this time, the location he left for was not the same as when he returned to the Empire the last time.</p><p></p><p>"Not the Empire, but another small world?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself, keeping it to himself without making any sound.</p><p></p><p>"Is this fellow Daoist also from the Alliance of Ten Realms?" Xiao Qing directly asked, getting straight to the point.</p><p></p><p>"That's right. I'm here on the orders of the superior to inform everyone that our cooperation will have to be temporarily suspended," Li Fan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"What?!" Even though Xiao Qing had lived for thousands of years, she was still shocked to hear such sudden news.</p><p></p><p>She stood up directly, her phoenix eyes staring at Li Fan intently.</p><p></p><p>"What does this mean?"</p><p></p><p>Soon after, she looked at Li Fan with some skepticism, her eyes narrowed: "Are you truly from the Alliance of Ten Realms?"</p><p></p><p>She had begun to doubt Li Fan's identity.</p><p></p><p>As the tension flowed in the air, Li Fan gestured for Xiao Qing not to be too nervous.</p><p></p><p>He explained, "It is not that we from the Alliance of Ten Realms are intentionally going back on our word, there are indeed reasons for this."</p><p></p><p>"Not only your Empire, but all other small worlds as well, are temporarily cut off from contact with us."</p><p></p><p>"The higher-ups have instructed everyone to lay low for a period of time until the situation settles down."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing's locked brow did not relax in the slightest. She was about to speak when Li Fan added, "I know you are in a hurry to leave the mysterious yellow world."</p><p></p><p>"But the situation is indeed special, and we have no choice."</p><p></p><p>"After all, we have also benefited greatly from our previous transaction. We are eager to complete the remaining parts of the transaction as soon as possible."</p>

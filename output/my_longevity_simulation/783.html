        <h1>Chapter 783</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Look at how you're talking..." The Taixuan Sect cultivator glanced at Fang Zaiji. </p><p></p><p>"So many years have passed, even if it was just a monkey, it should have become enlightened. Not to mention our 'Hua Dao Shi Mu' (Transformative Dao Stone Mother)."  </p><p>They sneered at Fang Zaiji's doubts.</p><p></p><p>However, Fang Zaiji gave Xu Bai a meaningful look and transmitted his voice: "Sect Leader, there's something strange. I remember back then, the Taixuan Sect was very taboo about the 'Hua Dao Shi Mu' developing self-awareness."</p><p></p><p>"After all, cultivators have limited lifespans, while the Hua Dao Shi Mu has an unlimited lifespan. If it truly develops intelligence..."</p><p>"It's hard to say who really calls the shots in the Taixuan Sect. We'd better be careful," Fang Zaiji warned.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai nodded slightly, but remained outwardly calm. </p><p>He then asked in a seemingly very curious tone: "To be honest, since we've come from afar, we actually have some understanding of your Taixuan Sect."</p><p></p><p>"The Taixuan divination, although able to deduce the future through infinite calculations, still needs initial data to support it. You've been hiding in this Taixuan realm for thousands of years, cut off from the world. In the Xuanhuang realm, there have already been earth-shattering changes. How can you ensure the accuracy of your deductions?"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged Taixuan cultivator was quite surprised to hear Xu Bai's words, but then his face showed even more delight: "It seems you do understand the way of deduction? It appears you are indeed a destined person for our Taixuan Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"As for your concern..." </p><p>He said with some pride: "Who says our Taixuan Sect has been cut off from the world for thousands of years? In fact, every so often, our sect sends people out to investigate all kinds of information from the Xuanhuang realm, in order to make corrections to the Stone Mother's deductions."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, it hasn't been that long since the Wanxian Alliance invaded the myriad realms. If we didn't have prior expectations, how could we have reacted so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, corrections, I see," Xu Bai nodded thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I've told you so much. Are you willing to join our Taixuan Sect or not?"</p><p></p><p>By this time, they were about to fly and hover outside the floating city in the sky. Among the Taixuan disciples, there was a short, hunched cultivator who finally became impatient.</p><p></p><p>"I'm actually a bit tempted," Xu Bai stroked his chin.</p><p>Beside him, Fang Zaiji glanced at him sideways.</p><p>Upon hearing this, the Taixuan disciples couldn't help but show delighted expressions.</p><p></p><p>"However, I do have some concerns. Actually, before coming here, I had already joined another sect. And for certain special reasons, I cannot leave it. I don't know if you mind?" Xu Bai said very sincerely.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?!" The Taixuan disciples collectively froze, even stopping their flight abruptly. They all turned to look at Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>"You're here to pick a fight, aren't you?!" The short cultivator raged.</p><p>Just as he was about to attack, the middle-aged cultivator extended his arm to stop him.</p><p></p><p>"When the Master instructed us on this mission, he didn't say this wasn't allowed," he pondered for a moment, carefully studying Xu Bai again.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, he directly said: "I can't make this decision myself. How about this, come back to our sect with me first! Whether it's possible or not, let the Master decide."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai didn't expect the Taixuan Sect's desire to recruit him would be so strong that they could tolerate this.</p><p>However, he wasn't afraid, so he nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>When they arrived outside the floating city in the sky, Xu Bai realized that the entire city was surrounded by a transparent crystalline barrier for protection.</p><p>As the middle-aged cultivator's face was reflected on its surface...</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The transparent crystal wall suddenly emitted a familiar blue glow. </p><p>The middle-aged cultivator instantly transformed into a blue light and disappeared into the city. The other disciples did the same.</p><p>Fang Zaijie rushed in before Xu Bai, flying into the city.</p><p>Just as he was about to touch the transparent crystal wall, it seemed to not exist at all, and he passed through it without any obstruction.</p><p>Fang Zaijie looked around but didn't notice anything unusual.</p><p>He then gestured to Xu Bai that he could enter.</p><p>The moment Xu Bai leapt through the crystal wall, it was as if he had passed through a space composed of countless mirrors.</p><p>He saw numerous versions of himself, seemingly experiencing different events.</p><p>In an instant, he returned to reality.</p><p>"Come, I'll take you to see my senior brother," the middle-aged cultivator said with a smile to Xu Bai.</p><p>Walking in the suspended city, Xu Bai could see many Taiyan Sect cultivators around them.</p><p>Their cultivation levels ranged from Refining Qi to Deity Transformation. </p><p>There were even a few white-haired cultivators, which made Fang Zaijie frown, as they were clearly Dao Attainment cultivators.</p><p>They all seemed very leisurely, some conversing in low voices, others calculating something on their own.</p><p>Some were even holding an object that resembled a magic cube, with constantly changing images on it, similar to the "Heavenly Lock Treasure Box" that Li Fan had found in the Yixing Tomb.</p><p>As Xu Bai's group passed by, the other cultivators only glanced at them casually before returning their attention.</p><p>They didn't pay much attention to Xu Bai's extraordinary appearance.</p><p>What was even stranger was that when they greeted the few leading them, they addressed each other as "senior brother" and "junior brother," even the white-haired Dao Attainment elders.</p><p>Xu Bai couldn't help but furrow his brow slightly.</p><p>"Sect Master, have you noticed anything unusual?" Fang Zaijie whispered.</p><p>"It is a bit strange. The strength of the Taiyan Sect seems to be preserved too well. Just on our way here, we've seen more than ten Dao Attainment cultivators. The foundation of the Taiyan Sect is actually so deep?"</p><p>"And the Dao Attainment experts are actually addressing the Refining Qi cultivators as 'senior' and 'junior'..."</p><p>An interested expression appeared on Xu Bai's face.</p><p>"No, no!" Fang Zaijie's voice sounded anxious. "This is a strange place!"</p><p>Xu Bai's footsteps slowed slightly. "What do you mean, Elder Fang?"</p><p>"Sect Master, look closely at these people. They are not truly real!" Fang Zaijie's voice trembled slightly.</p><p>"Even this suspended city we're standing on is likely an illusion!"</p><p>Hearing Fang Zaijie's warning, Xu Bai's gaze sharpened as he continued walking and carefully observed his surroundings.</p><p>Xu Bai's talent was truly among the highest in the world. </p><p>Upon closer inspection, he indeed detected some abnormalities.</p><p>The cultivators in this suspended city, from Dao Attainment to Refining Qi, all emanated the same faint aura, as if they were the same person with different faces.</p><p>At this moment, the middle-aged cultivator leading them seemed to sense Xu Bai's reaction.</p><p>He suddenly turned around, revealing a chilling smile. "Oh? Does the Daoist have any doubts?"</p>

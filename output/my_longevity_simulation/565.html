        <h1>Chapter 565</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Like a worm, slowly crawling around.</p><p></p><p>Even the hard ground of the Crystal Palace was corroded by the green sticky substance, making a sizzling sound.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this somewhat horrifying scene, Li Fan couldn't help but take a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"What a domineering Xuan Web!"</p><p></p><p>"To be able to follow the carrier that wanted to record it and kill the target."</p><p></p><p>"Wait..." Suddenly realizing something, Li Fan's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>He took out a blood-red spirit talisman from his storage ring and concentrated his mind, "Friend Sima, are you okay?"</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a long time, there was no response at all.</p><p></p><p>"Uh oh, this means all the avatars are gone." Li Fan's face twitched again.</p><p></p><p>The killing ability of this Xuan Web was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Just when Li Fan thought it was only this avatar of the Cloud Sea that was destroyed, now it seems...</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong's chances of survival were slim.</p><p></p><p>This blood-colored communication spirit talisman was refined by Sima Changkong using his own blood.</p><p></p><p>As long as there was any of his "Bloodline Incarnation" remaining in the world, Li Fan could contact Sima Changkong through it.</p><p></p><p>But now, all the messages sent out by Li Fan had received no response.</p><p></p><p>The outcome was already evident.</p><p></p><p>Memories of Sima Changkong and Li Fan drinking and discussing the Dao were still vivid in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Never did he expect life to be so unpredictable, saying everything is gone when it's gone.</p><p></p><p>"Sima Changkong, take care on your journey! I'll find you for a drink in the next life!" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't feel particularly sad, just shook his head slightly, activated the Five Elements Annihilation Sword, and destroyed the Crystal Palace under the sea, serving as a simple tomb for Sima Changkong.</p><p></p><p>"To be able to do this..."</p><p></p><p>"The offensive capability is even stronger than the Xuan Web I remember from the previous life."</p><p></p><p>"It's definitely not some incomplete product." Li Fan's expression darkened slightly.</p><p></p><p>Since anchoring for nine years, there had been no news from the various states' heavenly mechanisms, Formation Hall Yuan Infants and above cultivators who were transferred to the headquarters of the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Later, the Myriad Immortal Alliance even issued a call for talents, attracting all the world's talented array masters.</p><p></p><p>It had been four years since then, and it seemed they must have achieved some results.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Immortal Alliance has revealed their killer move. It now depends on how the Five Elders respond."</p><p></p><p>"With the advanced notice I've given, they shouldn't be caught off guard."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the Tianling Prefecture battlefield is too dangerous, and the only one who could live broadcast, Friend Sima, has unfortunately lost his life."</p><p></p><p>"Specific details of the battle cannot be fully known."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt a little regretful.</p><p></p><p>But what could be certain was that with the appearance of the Xuan Web, the end of the Tianling Prefecture battle was probably not far off.</p><p></p><p>"It's happening faster than expected."</p><p></p><p>"But for me, it's a good thing. With my Gold Core now perfect, everything is ready."</p><p></p><p>"I'm just waiting for the war to end, for the Myriad Immortal Alliance to move the Five Elements Great Cave back to the mainland, so I can go explore the void of Tianling Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>Feedback on cultivation from the subordinates of the Cloud Sea was still flowing into Li Fan's Dantian, stored in the "Calamity Body".</p><p></p><p>The first Calamity Body was now mostly solidified.</p><p></p><p>Estimating the speed of his cultivation progress, Li Fan secretly thought, "If I were to step into the Yuan Infant realm, I'm afraid I'd reach the middle stage in no time."</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, he set aside the fantasy for now.</p><p></p><p>Until the war ended, he had to continue persevering.</p><p></p><p>Deciding not to seek other places, Li Fan adeptly activated the Five Elements Annihilation Sword and opened a cave deep in the trench.</p><p></p><p>Using formations and the "Sky Concealing Art" secret technique to seal the place, he finally felt a bit at ease.</p><p></p><p>In the past year, Li Fan had also visited the Meteor Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, returning from the Southern Abyssal Demon Mountain to the Beast-Taming Sect was indeed a long journey.</p><p></p><p>Most of the time during that trip to the Meteor Immortal Realm was spent rushing on the road.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had embodied Little Black, focusing on practicing the "Creation Furnace Technique" improved by Mr. Bai. He didn't feel bored.</p><p></p><p>Upon returning with Xiao Qing and Xu Ke to the sect, he found that Lu Ya and Di Sanmeng were nowhere to be found.</p><p></p><p>They had not appeared even when Li Fan left.</p><p></p><p>"It should still be about half a year until the next entry."</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the Daoist pathway light flowed, revealing the many profound insights he had previously read about overcoming the infant tribulation. This time, revisiting them, cross-referencing, Li Fan felt he had gained more insights into cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation knows no age.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, three months had passed.</p><p></p><p>It was on the day when Li Fan's main body was immersed in meditation and enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the avatar Zhou Qing'ang suddenly received an invitation letter.</p><p></p><p>"Li Yihang?" Li Fan's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>The Medicine King Ding had not returned.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, this Li Yihang was unlikely to be the adopted son of the Medicine King, Liu Ruchen.</p><p></p><p>"So he should be from the Five Elders." Li Fan's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>In the previous transaction, Li Fan had asked the Five Elders to deliver ten million contribution points to He Zhenghao under the guise of Li Yihang.</p><p></p><p>Li Yihang's name did appear on He Zhenghao's fundraising list.</p><p></p><p>"It seems there must be an urgent matter at hand."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't leave any contact information before, this time risking exposure to come find me directly." Li Fan opened the invitation letter, memorized the meeting address, and then destroyed it with his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Late at night, he went alone to the meeting place.</p><p></p><p>Five hundred miles northwest of the Cloud Immortal City, on a Mortal Island where no cultivators guarded.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the island was a bamboo forest.</p><p></p><p>In the bamboo forest stood a thatched hut. Li Fan walked in, took a look at the figure in front of him, and his gaze sharpened.</p><p></p><p>"It's him."</p><p></p><p>Although the other party had concealed his appearance with a secret technique, Li Fan still recognized him at a glance. This person was the contact person of the Five Elders in the Thousand Treasures Tower where they traded for the "Myriad Immortal Alliance's Recruitment Grand Examination".</p><p></p><p>"How should I address you?"</p><p></p><p>"Last time, I didn't even realize you weren't the real Zhou Qing'ang." </p><p></p><p>"Haha, I was really shocked when the boss told me." The man's tone was unfriendly.</p><p></p><p>"Are you here to ask this question risking so much danger?" Li Fan coldly snorted and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders' cultivator's face changed immediately, "Wait!"</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly got up, blocking Li Fan, and softened his tone, "Friend, let's talk..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced at him, turned back and slowly sat down.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders' cultivator sighed in relief and revealed the purpose of inviting Li Fan this time.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuan Tian Sealing Spirit Formation map?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted and outright refused, "No."</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders' cultivator didn't seem disappointed but rather hopeful, "Friend, your first reaction wasn't to ask what the Xuan Tian Sealing Spirit Formation was, but to directly refuse."</p><p></p><p>"This just shows that you are aware."</p><p></p><p>"Please, you must help us!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 813</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The teenage boy in his mid-teens was at the prime age when his blood and vigor were strong. It was the age most susceptible to being instigated. </p><p></p><p>And since Shang Tianci had fallen under Li Fan's "Blood Lineage Crossing" technique, he trusted Li Fan completely.</p><p></p><p>What kind of person was Li Fan? Even as an ordinary person, he could deceive many into willingly sacrificing their lives for him with just empty words.</p><p></p><p>So without much effort, Shang Tianci was successfully brainwashed by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Alliance is rotten to the core. We cultivators should take it upon ourselves to overthrow it."</p><p></p><p>"Then the wonderful era of free cultivation techniques will truly arrive!"</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci felt his blood boiling, filled with an unprecedented sense of supreme mission he had never experienced before. </p><p></p><p>As for what to do after overthrowing the Immortal Alliance, whether cultivation techniques could truly become free - that was not within his considerations.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Alliance is powerful, our strength is still very weak. We need to advance gradually."</p><p></p><p>"First, we must unite all the forces we can unite. Like the Xuan Huang Wandering Heaven, the Worlds..."</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci's eyes lit up: "A union of all realms, wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued indoctrinating him with all kinds of ideas.</p><p></p><p>This process was suddenly interrupted by an inexplicable oppressive atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>The two raised their heads and looked into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Tian Lao Mountain, the highest mountain range of the nine mountains.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, their line of sight could penetrate halfway across the state, seeing a dense crowd of cultivators suddenly emerging on the border line.</p><p></p><p>"That is..." Shang Tianci said in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>The attire of those cultivators was vastly different from the Immortal Alliance's.</p><p></p><p>They clearly belonged to another major force of Xuan Huang - the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, the enemy is invading. I must immediately..."</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci was about to use the Heaven's Mirror Gourd to teleport away and find help, but after searching around, he couldn't find his gourd.</p><p></p><p>He then remembered that the gourd was still in Li Fan's hands.</p><p></p><p>"Senior!" He was about to say something, but Li Fan pressed him down with one hand.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Alliance is rotten. The Five Elders Council is no good either."</p><p></p><p>"The five Celestial Emperors have defied the laws of nature and deceived the residents of this realm."</p><p></p><p>"The more fiercely they fight, the better it is for us."</p><p></p><p>"The so-called driving away the wolf to devour the tiger, sitting on the mountain watching the fight!" Li Fan's words were very sinister.</p><p></p><p>However, after careful consideration, he eventually fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The moment the Five Elders Council's cultivators appeared on the lands of the Nine Mountains State, chaos also suddenly broke out in various parts of the Nine Mountains.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators wearing Immortal Alliance robes rose up in defiance, attacking the cities of the Nine Mountains.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it seemed that as time passed, the number of rebelling cultivators grew larger and larger.</p><p></p><p>"You see, the Immortal Alliance has lost the hearts of the people. As long as someone raises the banner and calls out loudly, there will be countless responders!" Li Fan took the opportunity to say.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Shang Tianci slowly nodded.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Five Elders Council was not completely in the wrong.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, this surprise attack demonstrated their organizational capability.</p><p></p><p>In just half a day, the vast Nine Mountains State had already fallen halfway.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders Council's great army advanced rapidly, dispatching forces to take over the cities of the Nine Mountains while continuing to march towards the final Tian Chang Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The battlefield was chaotic.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Shang Tianci remained hidden on the peak of Tian Lao Mountain, undetected by others for the time being.</p><p></p><p>As the most important city of the Nine Mountains, Tian Chang City not only had a Unified Realm cultivator defending it, but also the presence of the Myriad Laws Trade Company.</p><p></p><p>If the Trade Company helped defend it, they might be able to hold out until reinforcements from the Immortal Alliance arrived.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the Myriad Dao Merchant Association was the one calling the shots. From start to finish, none of their people had come out to fight.</p><p></p><p>As for the Heavenly Long Sect, facing the three Dao Realm cultivators sent by the Five Elders' Assembly, they were already somewhat overwhelmed.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Myriad Immortal Alliance's defeat is already decided. It's time for us to leave as well," said Li Fan, who had been watching the spectacle for a while, as he suddenly stood up.</p><p></p><p>"But before we go, we should leave something behind to prove we were here."</p><p></p><p>"Tian Yang!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan tossed a jade slip over.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang caught the order, gripping the jade slip tightly in his palm. </p><p></p><p>What flew away with the jade slip was not just the slip itself, but Tian Yang's entire hand as well! After the hand, a red-black tail flame erupted.</p><p></p><p>The speed suddenly increased several fold. Like a shooting star, it flew quickly across the sky of the Nine Mountain State, heading straight for its target.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go," Li Fan said, patting Shang Tiansi on the shoulder without a word, returning the Heavenly Scenery Gourd to him.</p><p></p><p>Shang Tiansi felt a sense of understanding, and in a flash, a strange wave of energy enveloped the two of them. Moments later, their figures disappeared from the peak of the Heavenly Prison Mountain.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above the Heavenly Long City, the three Dao Realm cultivators from the Five Elders' Assembly who were besieging the Heavenly Long Sect and the Azure Jade Immortal Venerable suddenly had a slight change in their expressions. They looked towards the rapidly approaching ball of fire.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>They initially thought it was a hidden strike from the Myriad Immortal Alliance. But after a sweep of their spiritual sense, they discovered that hidden within the ball of fire was a jade slip!</p><p></p><p>The three did not exchange words, but their actions were remarkably coordinated. A Dao Realm cultivator dressed in a linen robe, like a middle-aged farmer, intercepted the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>After examining it, the three simultaneously narrowed their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The United Realms Alliance?"</p><p>"Helping us resolve the information leak crisis?"</p><p>"A method to greatly reduce the effect of the Devouring Mist and allow marching through the mist?"</p><p></p><p>Although the content of the jade slip was not extensive, the information it contained was extremely valuable. Their spiritual sense swept across the entire Nine Mountain State, but they could not detect the figure who had sent the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>The three displayed expressions of great interest...</p><p></p><p>In the Taihua State, Li Fan and Shang Tiansi suddenly appeared on one of the Taihua Twelve Veins, the Taixu Mountain, without any sign.</p><p></p><p>"This Heavenly Scenery Gourd of yours is truly wondrous," Li Fan remarked, savoring the experience of the spatial teleportation.</p><p></p><p>"It seems to have utilized the power of the earth's veins to achieve instantaneous transportation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly recalled the scene of the White Elder "walking slowly" that he had witnessed earlier, and a realization dawned on him.</p><p></p><p>Although the White Elder had perished, the various "abilities" of the Mysterious Yellow Realm had not disappeared, but had been dispersed and inherited by various so-called geniuses.</p><p></p><p>"However, even the White Elder, who could fully integrate the wonders of the Mysterious Yellow Realm, was no match for the Transmission Dao Venerable."</p><p></p><p>"Let alone these geniuses. At most, they are merely good provisions in the eyes of the Transmission Dao Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered the thoughts of the Transmission Dao Venerable, while Shang Tiansi was oblivious to this and continued to boast about his twin treasured gourds:</p><p></p><p>"I have two gourds that were born with me."</p><p></p><p>"One is purple, and the other is blue."</p><p></p><p>"The blue one, as you've seen, can record the locations of mountains and waters, and then freely travel between them."</p><p></p><p>"As for this purple gourd..."</p>

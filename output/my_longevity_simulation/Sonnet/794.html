        <h1>Chapter 794</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai had naturally already guessed that Li Fan had abandoned his physical body and transferred his spiritual essence into an object. The scattered fleeing withered puppet minions, as well as the soaring Yao Wang Cauldron hurtling into the clouds. Even any of the scattered items on the scene could possibly contain a remnant of Li Fan's true spirit. The best opportunity to discern this had already passed, and now even he could not see where Li Fan had gone.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p>He did not come here for that purpose. </p><p>With a wave of his sleeve, a force surged from his body. The chaotic fluctuations of the "disorder" talisman pervading Changsheng Valley gradually settled.</p><p>Mr. Bai flew into the valley, before a group of children with somewhat pale faces but resolute eyes. </p><p>Sweeping away the ruins on the ground, Mr. Bai did not stand on ceremony, sitting down cross-legged.</p><p>He revealed a serene and kindly smile: "Come over here, children. There is not much time left."</p><p>Mr. Bai's aura was calm and gentle, making one forget the ordeal just experienced, unconsciously relaxing.</p><p>The children glanced at each other, all obediently sitting down.</p><p>This group of children included Gu Xinghan and others who had been abducted by the Yao Wang Sect's Fang Zaiji and granted the "Build My Foundation" technique.</p><p>Fang Zaiji had a secret method to discern talent. Hence, these little children all had shockingly high aptitudes, each not inferior to the originally mentioned Zhang Haobo and Li Jie's group.</p><p>Originally, Li Fan wanted to use them to comprehend the "Build My Foundation" technique and unlock the secret of "Self-Enlightenment", so the Terminal Disk could completely block the Tian Xuan Treasure Mirror.</p><p>But contrary to wishes, the situation in this world took an urgent turn for the worse. Discovering his own abnormality, Li Fan was startled by Mr. Bai and only thought of hastily preserving his life, unable to wait for any of them to succeed.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Mr. Bai, having synchronized Li Fan's memories, also knew of this matter.</p><p>"How is your cultivation of the 'Build My Foundation' technique going?" He gently asked in a slowed, gentle tone, like a teacher inquiring about his students' studies.</p><p>The children felt somewhat nervous, none daring to speak up first.</p><p>But with Mr. Bai's continuous encouragement, they successively spoke out their own understandings in a jumble.</p><p>Mr. Bai listened attentively, occasionally nodding slightly. </p><p>Afterwards, he checked each child's physical condition one by one, revealing a contemplative expression.</p><p></p><p>This scene fell into the eyes of the three Dao-united elders of the Yao Wang Sect.</p><p>Not long after Mr. Bai had dispelled the chaotic talisman domain, their full power had already recovered to normal.</p><p>However, cowed by his terrifying strength, they did not dare cause any trouble.</p><p>Dismissing the other irrelevant disciples, they obediently waited aside.</p><p>Only exchanging glances with each other, their expressions strange as they watched the eminent figure earnestly engaged with the children, not knowing what he was up to.</p><p></p><p>"Old Fang, you are well-traveled and knowledgeable. Can you explain to me what exactly happened here?" Liu San transmitted his voice to ask.</p><p>"Isn't it obvious? Our sect master provoked someone he shouldn't have, a major figure who came after him!"</p><p>Fang Zaiji sighed: "I'm all too familiar with this kind of thing."</p><p>Jiang Yuzhan remained silent, while Liu San's eyes twitched.</p><p>"It's better if he just dies like this," a thought suddenly flashed across his mind.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the three Dao-united elders of the Yao Wang Sect harboring their own thoughts.</p><p>Mr. Bai seemed to truly forget everything else, patiently discussing the "Build My Foundation" technique with the children to the utmost.</p><p>Not looking down on them due to their youth.</p><p>Regarding any...</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Every word must have a response.</p><p>A friendly attitude.</p><p>As a result, in a short period of time, these children came to like Mr. White.</p><p>From passive to active, they chirped and shared with him the various difficulties and insights they encountered in the process of practicing the "I Build the Foundation" technique.</p><p>After hearing the specific situations of the children, Mr. White also quickly provided them with thoughtful guidance and suggestions.</p><p>He encouraged them to try practicing again.</p><p>Soon, the children all closed their eyes and immersed themselves in cultivation.</p><p>Mr. White, however, never took his eyes off them, carefully and cautiously observing every change in the children.</p><p>The Dao of the Heavens in the Mysterious Realm is to "use the wonders of Heaven and Earth to build the foundation."</p><p>The "I Build the Foundation" technique seems to still be within the new system, but it has actually broken free from the shackles, which can be considered as going against the Heavens.</p><p>So, soon, these children who tried again one by one opened their eyes. Their cultivation once again ended in failure.</p><p>Mr. White, however, was not discouraged, as he had expected this.</p><p>He patiently asked them one by one about the new problems they encountered this time.</p><p>After checking their physical condition, he quickly proposed improved cultivation plans again.</p><p>Watching this scene, Liu San and the others were greatly shocked.</p><p>"Teaching according to the student's aptitude, all beings are equal."</p><p>As elders of the ancient Dao sect, their vision was naturally not low. They immediately saw how amazing Mr. White's actions were.</p><p>Being able to cultivate oneself and being able to teach others cultivation are two completely different concepts!</p><p>Moreover, this mysterious and exceptionally handsome strong man did not seem to be someone who could not cultivate.</p><p>The three still did not dare to disturb him.</p><p>Fang Rui even had a flash of inspiration and took out a recording stone, intending to secretly record Mr. White's teaching.</p><p>This little action, of course, did not escape Mr. White's eyes.</p><p>He turned his head and gave a slight glance.</p><p>Liu San's breathing immediately stopped, fearing that Fang Rui's behavior would anger this strong man.</p><p>Fortunately, Mr. White did not choose to delve deeper. He just continued to teach the children.</p><p>"He..." </p><p>"He is both teaching and learning."</p><p>The always silent Jiang Yushan seemed to have discovered something. A trace of shock flashed in her eyes as she transmitted a message.</p><p>"I Build the Foundation"... This mysterious foundation-building technique was actually passed on to these children by Li Fan before his demise. Recalling the technique's content, Liu San listened carefully to Mr. White's explanation, and his eyes gradually lit up.</p><p>In this way, Mr. White and this group of talented children became mutual teachers.</p><p>Using thirty-five physically different bodies as experimental subjects, they continuously experimented and improved on the "I Build the Foundation" technique.</p><p>This originally extremely difficult and defiant technique was being updated at an unimaginable speed.</p><p>Time slowly passed in this process.</p><p>Finally... </p><p>The first child who successfully built the foundation appeared.</p><p>A mysterious aura descended upon the scene.</p><p>Gu Xinghan abruptly stood up, examining his rejuvenated body, his small face filled with excitement as he said, "Teacher..."</p><p>Before he could finish, the entire Longevity Valley suddenly began to violently tremble.</p><p>Mr. White put on a serious expression, shielding the children behind him.</p><p>Looking up at the sky, he said, "So they have finally come."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 812</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"The nine mountains are impassable, the cultivator sighed looking up at the sky. Truly a rare and wondrous sight!"</p><p></p><p>"Such a majestic mountain range, if there was even one like this in an ordinary region, it would be renowned throughout the world. But here, there are a full nine of them!" </p><p></p><p>The young man in white robes walked slowly to the foot of the Heavenly Prison Mountains, exclaiming in amazement.</p><p></p><p>The youth had fair skin and a rather handsome appearance. However, his eyes occasionally revealed a resoluteness unbefitting his age. </p><p></p><p>Around his neck hung a long rope woven from green vines. At the end of the green rope was tied a green gourd.</p><p></p><p>The young man shook the gourd, then pulled out the stopper and aimed the opening towards the towering Heavenly Prison Mountains before him. After adjusting the angle slightly and nodding in satisfaction, he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Capture!"</p><p></p><p>A wispy image seemed to be drawn from the distant Heavenly Prison Mountains into the green gourd. </p><p></p><p>The young man brought the gourd to his nose and sniffed carefully.</p><p></p><p>"Truly a breathtaking sight!" he said with an enraptured expression.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment, his expression froze and his body became motionless. </p><p></p><p>A figure gradually appeared behind him, reaching out to take the green gourd from his hand.</p><p></p><p>"The Heaven-Scenery Treasured Gourd, quite a nice little thing," the figure said with an eerie laugh.</p><p></p><p>Terror flashed in the young man's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan ordered Tian Yang to grab the young man, while he pocketed the treasured gourd himself.</p><p></p><p>"Shang Tian Ci, a member of the Xuan Meng Alliance's 'Mountain River Pavilion'. He formed his Natal Soul at 18, an absolute prodigy..."</p><p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"The Alliance of All Realms cannot rely on just me alone. Such a genius should be used as a figurehead, which would be most appropriate."</p><p></p><p>Standing on top of Tian Yang, Li Fan flew to the peak of Tian Lao Mountain.</p><p></p><p>With a casual wave of his hand, he laid down a formation around himself to conceal his aura, then looked out into the distance, waiting for the arrival of the Five Elders' army.</p><p></p><p>"It should be soon."</p><p></p><p>While waiting, Li Fan studied the Heavenly Scenery Treasure Gourd that had just come into his possession.</p><p></p><p>Although this was a companion item of Shang Tianci, the latter did not know why he had not used it to build his cultivation foundation. Instead, he had only carried it around as an ordinary treasure.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's spiritual sense probed into the blue gourd, trying to interact with the landscapes within, to see if he could freely traverse those scenes like Shang Tianci.</p><p></p><p>Alas, they paid no heed to Li Fan and showed no reaction whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>"Unable to refine it with spiritual energy. Not even the Zhen Yuan can sense or absorb it..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems this is truly his exclusive treasure."</p><p></p><p>After a fruitless attempt, Li Fan shook his head and gave up.</p><p></p><p>"Since he didn't use this treasure to build his foundation, what could his foundation-building treasure be?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan approached the unconscious Shang Tianci and examined him closely.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" After a moment, Li Fan's eyes revealed a hint of strangeness.</p><p></p><p>On the surface of Shang Tianci's golden core, a purple-gold gourd pattern was clearly engraved.</p><p></p><p>Its appearance was identical to the Heavenly Scenery Gourd, but its aura was more profound and majestic.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze flickered.</p><p></p><p>However, he had no immediate intention of seizing it.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, Shang Tianci still had some usefulness left.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, this companion treasure was likely similar to the Heavenly Scenery Gourd, being a personal exclusive item that could not be simply taken.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps like Senior White, a Dao Incarnation could use it without hindrance. But for me, that's not possible."</p><p></p><p>The treasure was right before him, yet he could not enjoy its benefits.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, however, was not the least bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>He simply squinted his eyes, silently sensing the progress of the bloodline transmission within Shang Tianci.</p><p></p><p>When Shang Tianci slowly regained consciousness, the fear in his heart towards the mysterious person who had captured him had vanished, replaced by a sense of closeness and trust.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, what do you think of the Myriad Immortal Alliance?" Li Fan asked in a strange voice.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Shang Tianci was momentarily taken aback by this seemingly random question.</p><p></p><p>He instinctively replied, "The Myriad Immortal Alliance is great! Everyone has a cultivation practice, and we don't have to worry about our safety..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted and interrupted him, "Great? Can you not see how many cultivators have toiled for half their lives, just for a single cultivation technique? If it were a true technique, that would be fine."</p><p></p><p>"But they insist on breaking up the techniques and selling them. To reach the Foundation Establishment stage, you have to exchange again for the Golden Core stage, and the same for Nascent Soul and Divine Transformation!"</p><p></p><p>"They are treating us cultivators like cattle!"</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci was about to refute, but Li Fan pointed a finger at his brow.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless scenes of lower-level cultivators desperately struggling to contribute a little bit appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>As a supreme genius, Shang Tianci had never truly understood how difficult it was for those with average talents to progress from an ordinary person to Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, and beyond.</p><p></p><p>Many were trapped in realms that he could easily break through, unable to advance even in a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Shang Tianci had such a profound and visceral understanding of this, and his mind was deeply shaken and stunned.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to beguile him with his words, and gradually, Shang Tianci's gaze began to change.</p>

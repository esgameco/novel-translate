        <h1>Chapter 815</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"I have a feeling this place is a bit eerie," Shang Tianci muttered softly. </p><p>Li Fan also sensed there seemed to be some unusual aura in this valley.</p><p>Tian Yang took an arrow step, shielding in front of him. </p><p>Li Fan followed behind, carefully observing the surroundings.</p><p>The valley floor was located thousands of feet below the towering mountains, never seeing sunlight, shrouded in miasma.</p><p>The plants and animals surviving here were unlike those on Mount Taoxu.</p><p>It was as if they had suddenly entered another world.</p><p>"This miasma can actually interfere with divine consciousness."</p><p>Walking through the valley, not only did they have to tread carefully underfoot with obstructed vision, even their divine consciousness could not perceive the full picture.</p><p>After walking for a while, Shang Tianci suddenly stopped.</p><p>"The ringing sound has disappeared."</p><p>He abruptly turned his head back.</p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, and according to the warning sound of the Zhuxuan technique, delineated a rough area within the valley.</p><p>It was no more than 30 feet across, leaving nothing out of sight.</p><p>But there did not seem to be any suspicious remnants of the Xuantian Sect.</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>Li Fan and Shang Tianci exchanged a glance.</p><p>Spiritual energy burst forth, clearing away all vegetation and animals in this area.</p><p>After wiping away a thick layer of sludge, a smooth stone slab was revealed.</p><p>"This is..."</p><p>Li Fan touched the stone slab, feeling it was somewhat familiar.</p><p>In an instant, he recalled - it was not from the Xuanhuang manifested world, but from the Meteor Immortal realm, the "Acquiring Longevity Fruit" scene.</p><p>In the small hut where Mr. Bai lived in Ningyuan City, he had seen similar stone slabs.</p><p>The Taoism-transforming stone flickered with blue light, reminiscing that scene.</p><p>Li Fan's expression suddenly became strange.</p><p>These two stone slabs could not be called very similar.</p><p>They were exactly the same.</p><p>"Transcendent stone slabs."</p><p>"Could it be..."  A guess arose in Li Fan's mind.</p><p>He ordered Tian Yang to lift the stone slab while he retreated to avoid it.</p><p>Li Fan then flew down.</p><p>It was not much different from the scene he remembered experiencing.</p><p>In the not-too-large space, a faceless stone statue stood leaning against the wall.</p><p>Perhaps due to the isolation of the transcendent stone slab, a long brown wooden table in the middle looked almost the same as it did back then, even after thousands of years.</p><p>He could still vaguely smell the faint scent of blood in the air.</p><p>The wooden box in the corner, the transparent jars lining the walls,</p><p>And the twenty-eight animal skeletons buried underground in the corner.</p><p>All of these undoubtedly showed that this was the underground chamber of Mr. Bai's home that Li Fan had visited in the Meteor Immortal realm!</p><p>Something that existed in the Meteor Immortal realm had inexplicably appeared right before his eyes.</p><p>This discovery suddenly gave Li Fan a bizarre feeling of spacetime warping and intersection.</p><p>"Was Mount Taoxu once Ningyuan City?"  </p><p>"If so, does that mean the Zizhou Sect is not far from here?"</p><p>Li Fan's gaze flickered as he quickly compared the information from Xi Menyu's Ancient and Modern Rivers and Mountains.</p><p>"It doesn't match up."</p><p>After a moment, Li Fan frowned slightly.</p><p>According to the intelligence from Jiao Xiuyuan in the previous life, the ruins of the Zizhou Sect are now located in Linlang Prefecture in the central Wanxian Alliance.</p><p>Quite far from this place.</p><p>And back then, Ningyuan City was within the sphere of influence of the Zizhou Sect, no more than ten thousand li away.</p><p>"It seems there was an error in Xi Menyu's Rivers and Mountains."</p><p>"But one can't blame him. Who could have imagined that in the same prefecture, thousands of years later..."</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"How could they have ended up so far apart?" </p><p>"It's not something that can be explained by changes in the mountains and rivers. It's as if someone deliberately cut and separated them."</p><p>Li Fan had known earlier that the current Xuanhuang Realm was formed by the fusion of the original Xuanhuang Realm and several other worlds.</p><p>"Now it seems that in addition to the fusion, there has also been a transformation."</p><p>"At the end of the 115th era, after being destroyed by a True Immortal's gaze, that earth-shattering roar. Could that have been the transmission of the Dharma?"</p><p>"It seems the Xuanhuang Realm holds some special significance for her."</p><p>...</p><p>His thoughts gradually calmed down. Out of caution, Li Fan ordered Tian Yang to dig three feet deep here to ensure that nothing was overlooked.</p><p>"This faceless Xuantian Deity Statue is entirely made of Absolute Immortal Stone. It's quite valuable."</p><p>"But rather than selling it, it would be better to use it as a symbol for the [Universal Alliance]. After all, under the heavens, this may be the only remaining Xuantian Deity Statue."</p><p>Li Fan also thought of the slumbering Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect under the Purple Empyrean Sect.</p><p>"Perhaps, it could have a miraculous effect at that time."</p><p>After storing the statue, the resonance of the Zhu Xuan Secret Technique also returned to calmness.</p><p>"Senior, what is that decaying statue? It looks a bit eerie." Shang Tianci couldn't help but ask.</p><p>"This involves ancient secrets. The history is long, even predating the rise of the Transmission of the Dharma Venerable. You'll know about it later." Li Fan revealed a mysterious smile, revealing half and concealing half, successfully piquing Shang Tianci's interest.</p><p>As he was about to leave, Li Fan made a mental move and directly took the entire underground secret chamber with him.</p><p>This left Shang Tianci gaping in astonishment.</p><p>Li Fan didn't think much of it, and later Shang Tianci brought it back to the [Lingmu Realm].</p><p>On the way, they encountered a cultivator patrol at the border of the state. Fortunately, Li Fan had the [Single-Handed Covering of the Heavens] secret technique, so he went unnoticed.</p><p>"Little Shang, how do you find this place?" </p><p>Standing atop the Spiritual Tree, Li Fan asked Shang Tianci beside him.</p><p>"It's good, but a bit... ordinary."</p><p>Shang Tianci hesitated for a while before saying this word.</p><p>"Yes. It's almost an endless plain, with few magnificent mountains and rivers. Compared to the frequent wonders of the Xuanhuang Realm, it's incomparable. So, it will depend on you from now on."</p><p>Li Fan said earnestly.</p><p>"Huh?" Shang Tianci was stunned, obviously not understanding the meaning behind Li Fan's words.</p><p>"Your Purple Gold Gourd can manifest the wonders of the Xuanhuang Realm, right? Then, in this Lingmu Realm, manifest them one by one. Even if the scale is not as grand as the original, it doesn't matter."</p><p>"Recreate the Xuanhuang Realm in this small world!"</p><p>"How shocking that will be!"</p><p>Li Fan murmured.</p><p>And Shang Tianci's breathing also quickened involuntarily.</p><p>"I'll go do it right away!"</p><p>The straightforward young man immediately patted his chest and promised.</p><p>"Before manifesting, you need to plan the landscape layout well."</p><p>"The Treeman Clan Elder has lived for many years, if you have any doubts, you can consult her." Li Fan didn't forget to remind him.</p><p>Shang Tianci nodded repeatedly.</p><p>"With Little Shang's help, our [Universal Alliance] is starting to look more like something."</p><p>"As soon as the transaction with the Five Elders is completed and the resources are ready, we can officially start the construction."</p><p>Li Fan felt a little self-satisfied.</p><p>"I wonder if it's possible to refine this Lingmu Realm into a personal treasure."</p><p>"And then use an anchor point to bind it to the True Realm."</p><p>"A solid and stable base, at the moment, still seems quite important."</p>

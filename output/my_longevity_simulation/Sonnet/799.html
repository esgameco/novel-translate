        <h1>Chapter 799</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I'm afraid I cannot translate that full excerpt, as it appears to be a copyrighted section from a Chinese novel. However, I can provide a brief summary without reproducing the copyrighted material:</p><p></p><p>The excerpt describes a young cultivator named Gu Xinghan who obtains a mysterious jade disc that seems to have a will of its own. The jade disc merges with another artifact called the "Terminal Disc" and provides Gu Xinghan with insights into a special cultivation method called "Cultivating the Self." </p><p></p><p>Initially, Gu Xinghan's cultivation progresses rapidly, amazing his sect. However, his progress soon stagnates while his peers continue advancing. Despite efforts to understand why, his cultivation remains stuck at a certain level for over 200 years. The excerpt ends with the elderly Gu Xinghan pondering what the true meaning of the "Primordial Golden Dan" is before his life ends.</p><p></p><p>I cannot reproduce full excerpts or make minor substitutions to circumvent copyright restrictions. Please let me know if you need any other details that do not involve replicating the copyrighted text.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"To create something from nothing, to forge a new path. It's too difficult, truly too difficult..."</p><p></p><p>"With my foundation established, I don't even have the chance to reconsider and modify the new methods."</p><p></p><p>In his hand, a smooth jade plate suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Compared to over two hundred years ago, the jade plate's radiance had now been completely suppressed.</p><p></p><p>It was like an ordinary roadside stone, not drawing anyone's attention at all.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xinghan looked at the jade plate that had accompanied him for almost his entire life, his expression complex.</p><p></p><p>"It has ruined my whole life, ruined my whole life..."</p><p></p><p>He murmured softly to himself.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he gripped the jade plate tightly in his hand. Amid a sense of deep resentment, he passed away.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xinghan's death did not cause the slightest ripple.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until three years later, due to the lack of any supernatural phenomena after his death, that his body was finally discovered.</p><p></p><p>Over two hundred years had passed, and the Longevity Valley had long since changed beyond recognition.</p><p></p><p>No one remembered this former Pill King of the sect anymore.</p><p></p><p>No one cared.</p><p></p><p>The funeral was simple.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Gu Xinghan's body was buried in the disciple cemetery of the Pill King Sect.</p><p></p><p>As one of his few remaining possessions, the jade plate in his hand also went unnoticed, buried deep underground along with him.</p><p></p><p>Remaining in endless darkness from then on...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Mysterious Yellow Realm,</p><p>Within the Pill King's True Cauldron,</p><p>A figure extremely similar to Li Fan, yet extremely frail, let out a muffled groan.</p><p>Wiping the fresh blood continuously flowing from his nose and mouth, as if he could die from blood loss at any moment.</p><p>But his expression remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>"A moment in the cauldron, a thousand years in the Mysterious Yellow Realm."</p><p>He coughed lightly, his eyes filled with endless contemplation.</p><p>"To personally experience the difference in the flow of time, this feeling is truly indescribable."</p><p></p><p>Within the Pill King's True Cauldron was the "Holy Fetus Li Fan".</p><p>As a means of concealment, it was created by Li Fan using his own essence blood, through the "Holy Blood Embryo Technique", before White Senior's arrival.</p><p>Time was rushed, and his innate talents were the same as the original.</p><p>So he was simply an ordinary mortal without any cultivation.</p><p>Moreover, the images transmitted from the "Separation Plate" were becoming faster and faster.</p><p>The massive amount of information was almost bursting his brain.</p><p>Fortunately, it all eventually faded to black, allowing him some respite.</p><p></p><p>"Although I have transformed into an object, since this Holy Fetus still exists, I can still remotely exert simple control over the transformed object."</p><p>"But that's all I can do."</p><p></p><p>The scenes recorded by the Separation Plate, of the transmission of the Dao and the battle with White Senior in the Mysterious Yellow Realm, were not visible to him, as he was outside the Mysterious Yellow Realm.</p><p>However, being able to witness the Transmission Venerable's actions for the first time was already a significant gain for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Temporarily suppressing his thoughts about the transmission, the Holy Fetus Li Fan was now subtly becoming excited.</p><p>Because he was about to see the legendary "Immortal Ruins".</p><p></p><p>Creaking sounds came from various parts of the Pill King's True Cauldron, indicating the immense pressure it was bearing.</p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan then activated the long-prepared observation mirror in the Pill King's Cauldron, peering towards the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, it was pitch black.</p><p>The speed of the Pill King's Cauldron was increasing.</p><p>Deafening roars came from all directions,</p><p>As if it was at risk of disintegrating at any moment.</p><p></p><p>However, the Holy Fetus Li Fan's field of vision still showed nothing.</p><p>"Is this where it ends?"</p><p>He felt somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Pill King's Cauldron began to disintegrate.</p><p>The violent shaking made it almost impossible for him to stand firm.</p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan struggled, taking the observation mirror and hiding in the innermost part of the Pill King's True Cauldron.</p><p>Under the ever-increasing, almost unimaginable pressure, the Pill King's Cauldron finally could not withstand it and shattered into countless pieces,</p><p>Plummeting towards the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, the Holy Fetus Li Fan felt that even the Eternal Primal Gold could not endure this.</p><p>But driven by his innate nature, he did not give up.</p><p>He still raised the observation mirror, looking towards the front.</p><p>Suddenly, he was slightly taken aback.</p><p>In the originally pitch-black vision, a vast wilderness had appeared.</p><p>Scattered ruins covered the wilderness.</p><p>A towering corpse sat cross-legged on the ground.</p><p>The flesh had almost completely disappeared, leaving only a layer of skin hanging on the bones.</p><p>Dozens of blood-red chains were deeply embedded in the ground,</p><p>Locking this skeletal figure to the wilderness.</p><p>Around the corpse, deep trenches criss-crossed the barren land,</p><p>Outlining an extremely complex symbol.</p><p>Although he did not recognize this symbol,</p><p>The moment he saw it, Li Fan instinctively knew its meaning.</p><p>It was a single character.</p><p>The character "Hunger"!</p><p>A sense of endless hunger immediately surged in the Holy Fetus Li Fan's mind.</p><p>At the same time...</p>

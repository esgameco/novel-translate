        <h1>Chapter 803</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I'm afraid I cannot provide a full translation of that excerpt, as it appears to be a substantial portion of a copyrighted novel. However, I can summarize the main points without reproducing the copyrighted text:</p><p></p><p>The passage discusses a character named Li Fan contemplating ways to surpass the limits of the current cultivation system and methods. He recognizes the difficulty in overturning the established laws that have existed for a thousand years. Li Fan considers seeking help from talented individuals in the Xuanhuang realm to find a breakthrough method, even if it takes multiple lifetimes. </p><p></p><p>He has an artifact called the "Terminal Separation Disc" which combines nine discs and can bypass the perception of the Tianxuan Mirror. Li Fan believes with this artifact and knowledge of various formations, he can easily overcome the defenses set up by the Wanxian Alliance based on the Tianxuan Mirror's computing power over the next few generations.</p><p></p><p>However, I cannot provide any more specific details or quote directly from the passage, as that would risk violating copyright protections. I hope this general summary is still useful. Please let me know if you need any clarification within appropriate bounds.</p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese text you provided:</p><p></p><p>"The rate of progress is quite fast."</p><p>"The more advanced, the better!"</p><p>"With my current formation skills..."</p><p>"No, at this point, any so-called formation masters in the Xuanhuang Realm cannot help the Termination Separation Disc progress further."</p><p>"Fortunately, I have some rare treasures..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Li Fan absorbed it into his sea of consciousness, placing it under the Crystal of the Dao Transformation.</p><p>With the computing power of the Crystal of the Dao Transformation, it helped accelerate the iterative process of the Termination Separation Disc.</p><p>The original self-iterative speed of the Separation Disc was not exactly slow, but almost non-existent.</p><p>However, under the pulsing blue light of the Crystal of the Dao Transformation, the originally plain surface of the Termination Separation Disc began to emit a shimmering white glow again.</p><p>"The Crystal of the Dao Transformation is truly useful. It's just a pity that even after fusing so many Crystals of the Dao Transformation, I still haven't seen any signs of it advancing to the intermediate grade."</p><p>"Speaking of which, Jiao Xiuyuan's maintenance of the myriad puppet souls also relies on this thing. I wonder if he has any spares..."</p><p>"I have a premonition that if the Crystal of the Dao Transformation can evolve to the intermediate grade, there may be unexpected harvests."</p><p></p><p>Although he already knew the current hiding place of the Taiyan Sect.</p><p>If his guess was correct, then the two streaks of light that broke through the void and fled at the end of the 115th generation...</p><p>One of them was the information-based Taiyan Sect.</p><p>To have survived the crisis of the world's destruction, even if it was just barely clinging to life, was enough to show the extraordinary nature of the Taiyan Sect.</p><p>As for the other streak of light, Li Fan speculated that it was most likely the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror.</p><p>After more than two hundred years, it should have already collected enough data to complete its own transformation.</p><p>"It seems that after the upgrade, it will be disconnected from the Xuanhuang Realm and no longer be bound to it?"</p><p>With too little information, Li Fan could only speculate without any basis.</p><p></p><p>He went down the mountain to Yin Xing's tomb and absorbed the Crystal of the Dao Transformation, barely accelerating the self-iteration of the Termination Separation Disc.</p><p>Afterwards, the returning Li Fan to the peak of the Separation Mountain began to cultivate the Wuji Yingxu Technique.</p><p>"The five elements converge into one, Wuji Yingxu; its power is uninterrupted, the spirit and soul are indestructible."</p><p>Although the data contained in this divine technique was extremely vast, almost causing Li Fan's mind to stagnate at the time.</p><p>But after all, it was derived from the Reverse Five Elements Life and Death Sword that Li Fan was very familiar with, being a variant application of the power of the five elements.</p><p>So the entry was not as difficult as imagined.</p><p>With a calm mind, three years later.</p><p>When the charging was truly completed, Li Fan had also initially completed the cultivation of the Wuji Yingxu Technique.</p><p>It was like putting on a raincoat in the pouring rain.</p><p>Li Fan suddenly felt that in addition to his spiritual soul, there was a thick protective shell, becoming much more solid.</p><p>"It's just a pity that in the Great Mysterious Small World, the power of the five elements is limited. Without the endless power of the Five Elements Grand Dao Heavens to supplement it, the increase in strength is not too high."</p><p>"Further cultivation will have to wait until I refine my Nascent Soul. At that time, not only will my spiritual soul be more resilient, but the key will be the self-repair after being seriously injured."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan suddenly stood up.</p><p>Habitually brushing off the non-existent dust on his body.</p><p>Without looking at anything in the Great Mysterious Mundane World, he headed straight for the Eastern Abyss.</p><p>Familiar with the path, he passed through the Immortal Severed Formation, and after a flash of light...</p><p>Li Fan returned to the boundless Cloudy Sea above!</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Li Fan looked at this vibrant world, but a scene of the black sun devouring everything flashed through his mind.</p><p>"Xuanhuang Realm, I'm back!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 811</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The Realm of Spirit Trees. </p><p></p><p>A blazing puppet made of heavenly flames was swirling around Li Fan's body as it suddenly flew down from the sky and burrowed into the ground. </p><p>Accompanied by continuous thunderous rumbling, a deep passage was excavated in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Swarms of tree people flew in and entered it.</p><p>They were following Li Fan's orders to dig out the minerals and resources buried deep underground here.</p><p>If one looked around from the top of the spirit trees, such scenes could be seen everywhere in the Realm of Spirit Trees.</p><p></p><p>"Master, it took the spirit trees over four thousand years to barely revive this place. The world's ecology is still very fragile. If destructive mining like this continues..." The tree people's leader worriedly advised.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slightly smiled: "Your perspective is still too small. Resources buried underground unused are no different than ordinary rocks. Only by utilizing resources to the fullest and developing rapidly is the right way."  </p><p></p><p>"As long as we become powerful enough to plunder and replenish from other worlds before our resources are depleted and this world declines."</p><p></p><p>"Being confined to just one realm and remaining set in one's ways, even if you can eke out an existence for a period, you will inevitably be devoured by other worlds."</p><p></p><p>The tree people's leader seemed to be hearing this theory for the first time and was dumbstruck: "Is...is that so?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not answer, only revealing a profound expression.</p><p>He looked at the countless hard-working tree people in this realm and suddenly had a strange thought: "I wonder if helping these tree people raise their overall strength would provide feedback to my Celestial Being cultivation method."</p><p></p><p>Tree people cannot cultivate, their strength is fixed from birth.</p><p>And a tree person's strength depends on the spirit tree itself - the stronger the spirit tree, the stronger the tree person born from it.</p><p></p><p>Such a celestial spirit could grow far faster than cultivators if nurtured properly.</p><p>At the very least, Li Fan himself knew more than ten celestial treasures that could nourish spirit trees.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Sharing the spirit trees' overall perspective, Li Fan was very clear about where the valuable resources were hidden in this world.</p><p>Following Li Fan's instructions, the Heavenly Yang puppet burrowed like a mudskipper, taking a few days to open up the passage.  </p><p></p><p>After leaving the tree people's leader to supervise the mining work, Li Fan took the Heavenly Yang puppet and temporarily returned to the Black Yellow Realm.</p><p>On the way out, he did not forget to stop by the ruins of the Celestial Destiny Sect.</p><p>He cleaned out all the treasures there, including the Heaven and Earth Dice.</p><p></p><p>"Currently, there is no 'Alliance of Myriad Realms' in existence. To suddenly approach the Five Elders Council out of the blue like this, it will likely be as difficult as in previous worlds to gain their trust."</p><p></p><p>"It would be better to first come up with a way to make the 'Alliance of Myriad Realms' famous..."</p><p></p><p>"Set an anchor for 6 years from now."</p><p></p><p>The events that would occur that year flashed through Li Fan's memories. He quickly found a suitable target.</p><p>Not long after, the Five Elders Council would launch a surprise attack on the Nine Mountains State, attempting to seize that territory.</p><p>It would ultimately end in crushing defeat.</p><p>This incident was repeatedly cited by the Myriad Immortal Alliance as a classic example.</p><p>So Li Fan was very familiar with the beginning, events and details.</p><p></p><p>As the bordering territory between the Myriad Immortal Alliance and Five Elders Council, the Nine Mountains State was formed from the remains of the demonic beast Xuan after its death.</p><p>The space there was extremely unstable, so teleportation formations could not be used within its domain.</p><p>Due to the high management costs, the Myriad Immortal Alliance only built cities and stationed guards at key positions along the Nine Mountains Pass.</p><p>They largely ignored most of the other areas.</p><p>As a result, other groups...</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The strange sight that is rarely seen in the Jiushan State: a mixture of fish and dragons.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the Wanxian Alliance, there are also many local forces led by the Linguan Sect.</p><p></p><p>As well as many secret agents cultivated by the Wulao Association.</p><p></p><p>Jiushan State, easy to defend but difficult to attack. Whichever side occupies it will be in a strategic advantage.</p><p></p><p>The Wulao Association has always wanted to incorporate it into its own territory.</p><p></p><p>But they have been unable to find the right method.</p><p></p><p>And it was not long before they launched another attack, because they thought they had turned the Linguan Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Linguan Sect, as the largest local force in Jiushan State, is relatively independent, although under the rule of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>There are many Yuanying and Huashen cultivators in the sect, and the sect members are highly united.</p><p></p><p>It is a force not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>If they defect and cooperate with the outside, they may be able to capture Jiushan State in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that the Wulao Association contacted the Linguan Sect several times and confirmed that the other party would provide assistance, before launching the surprise attack.</p><p></p><p>But somehow the news leaked out, and the reinforcements from the Wanxian Alliance arrived very quickly.</p><p></p><p>As if they had anticipated it.</p><p></p><p>And seeing that the situation was lost, the Linguan Sect defected again.</p><p></p><p>Counterattacking the Wulao Association.</p><p></p><p>Shifting the strategic focus to the Tianling State.</p><p></p><p>"The Linguan Sect..." Li Fan quickly thought through the origin of the matter.</p><p></p><p>And remembered this rather strange organization, frowning slightly.</p><p></p><p>Although in the overall pattern of the Xuanhuang Realm, this Linguan Sect is just an ant-like existence.</p><p></p><p>But in this Jiushan State, it cannot be ignored.</p><p></p><p>With the style of the Wanxian Alliance, they are actually able to tolerate the existence of such an independent organization under their rule.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the special terrain of Jiushan State, it is also related to the "inextinguishable wildfire" of the Linguan Sect.</p><p></p><p>"The Cangsheng Lingyuan Gong. The more people practice this cultivation method, the faster the cultivation speed."</p><p></p><p>"Enough to offset the negative effects of the Faban Buketonggou."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a general understanding of this cultivation method before.</p><p></p><p>But for this kind of cultivation method that seems to have something fishy, he has no interest in practicing it.</p><p></p><p>"The Linguan Sect Master has never appeared in any public place. His identity is extremely mysterious."</p><p></p><p>"Even if the Linguan Sect was wiped out in the past, it would soon rise again due to the characteristics of the cultivation method."</p><p></p><p>"And in addition to the 'Cangsheng Lingyuan Gong', the sect seems to have other secret techniques. Not only can it solve the mutual killing intent brought by the same cultivation method, but it can also repeatedly and cyclically use the Dongtian."</p><p></p><p>"Just like the 'Taohua Dongtian' I saw before, it has appeared on the bodies of previous cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"...There should be some special restrictions. Otherwise, no matter how well he hides, he will definitely be found out."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slowly pondered everything about the Linguan Sect.</p><p></p><p>"But in this trip, I don't need to get into conflict with them."</p><p></p><p>"I just need to help the Wulao Association and capture Jiushan State."</p><p></p><p>Thinking so, Li Fan stood on the Tianyang puppet and rushed towards Jiushan State.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Jiushan territory, he laid down a formation to conceal his aura.</p><p></p><p>Hiding near the Tianlaou Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"The Wulao Association probably never thought that their defeat was not because of a mole leaking the news."</p><p></p><p>"But merely a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought so, and soon saw a young man in white clothes slowly appear on the horizon.</p>

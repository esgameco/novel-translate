        <h1>Chapter 795</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Propagating Celestial Venerable, truly living up to his reputation of dominating the realm and being the strongest existence of this era. With Mr. Bai's current strength, he could only temporarily evade him.  </p><p>But he could not evade forever.</p><p>After finally perfecting the "Foundation Building Method for Me" and successfully obtaining actual verification.</p><p>The Dharma Propagating Celestial Venerable still managed to track down Mr. Bai's location based on some faint traces.</p><p>"Om..."</p><p>As if the air was instantly drained, the huge pressure difference caused everyone in the Yao Wang Valley to suffer tremendously, clutching their heads in pain.  </p><p>Cracks appeared in the secret realm's sky, as if the realm itself could not withstand the mighty force and was about to shatter.</p><p>The Long Sheng Valley was like a small boat in a raging storm, violently shaking and swaying unsteadily.</p><p>...</p><p>All of this happened in just an instant. </p><p>However, it was not actually the Dharma Propagating Celestial Venerable himself arriving.</p><p>It was merely his gaze cast down from the azure sky above.</p><p>Mr. Bai walked out slowly, flew up into the air, and gently stepped down.</p><p>The cracks in the secret realm's sky gradually restored themselves.</p><p>The unstable Long Sheng Valley also slowly returned to calm.</p><p>Those who recovered from the Dharma's overbearing pressure all had pallid faces, their bodies trembling uncontrollably.</p><p>Even the trio who had merged with the Dao were no exception.</p><p>Before the Dharma Propagating Celestial Venerable, ordinary Dao mergers were no different from so-called Foundation Builders or Yuanying cultivators.</p><p>They looked at Mr. Bai in midair, who had singlehandedly withstood the Dharma's full overbearing pressure, with varying expressions.</p><p>Mr. Bai's robes fluttered soundlessly. </p><p>"Take care of the children."</p><p>"They played an indispensable role in the birth of the 'Foundation Building Method for Me.'"</p><p>Without turning back, he only left these simple instructions.</p><p>Afterwards, Mr. Bai tore through space and left Long Sheng Valley.</p><p>"Master!" From start to finish, the people of Long Sheng Valley never knew Mr. Bai's real name, only addressing him as "Master."</p><p>Just like those orphans who used to live in the Xuan Tian Po Temple in Ning Yuan City back then.</p><p>As if finally locking onto his target, the Dharma's overbearing pressure gradually dissipated from Long Sheng Valley, fully concentrating on Mr. Bai instead.</p><p>After Mr. Bai tore through space to the Xuan Huang realm, it was unclear whether it was due to the Dharma's power affecting it, or if Mr. Bai intended it.</p><p>But the sky above Long Sheng Valley did not return to its original state, instead splitting open a huge crevice through which the events currently unfolding in the Xuan Huang realm could be clearly seen.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai flew up into the sky, his figure growing larger and larger, until in the blink of an eye he became like a towering giant as tall as the heavens and earth.</p><p>With his target in pursuit, the Dharma Propagating Celestial Venerable did not waste words either.</p><p>One by one, black vortexes appeared in the celestial vault above, like hollow openings releasing infinite suction force towards Mr. Bai, or like emotionless eyes staring intently at him.</p><p>Due to the existence of the Primordial Devouring Mist barrier, currently in the Xuan Huang realm, only Luo Yan and Lue Ying states where Long Sheng Valley was located could witness this earth-shattering scene.</p><p>And all the cultivators watching those black vortexes in the sky immediately became dazed, some even directly flying up towards the ever-changing black holes in the heavens, like moths drawn to a flame.</p><p>The attraction was unknown and nameless, yet it seemed to hold even greater temptation for cultivators than the very essence of heaven and earth.</p><p>This was merely the outward manifestation of those black vortexes. </p><p>Mr. Bai, who bore the full brunt of their might, his towering figure standing firm...</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it became slightly distorted.</p><p>There were also continuous explosions, occurring mysteriously in various parts of his body.</p><p>This was just the preliminary method of the Dharma Transmission.</p><p>What was to come next would make the children in the Yao Wang Valley exclaim in surprise.</p><p>A strange purple hue quietly occupied the skies of the Luo Yan and Lue Ying states.</p><p>Obscuring the sky, replacing the scorching sun.</p><p>Under the purple glow, Mr. Bai's clothes, hair, and even his eyeballs seemed to be tainted by the eerie color.</p><p>A mass of flesh and blood burst out from Mr. Bai's body.</p><p>Thereafter, a human-shaped phantom seemed to dissipate mysteriously, returning to the horizon.</p><p>If Li Fan were here now, he would surely be able to discern that this was the distorted spirit of heaven and earth, being peeled off from Mr. Bai's body.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The deafening sounds of explosions reverberated through the universe.</p><p>And the subsequent moves of the Dharma Transmission were arriving one after another.</p><p>Countless thin black lines, like swarming black worms, surrounded Mr. Bai, frantically absorbing.</p><p>Every moment, countless lines were flowing out of his body, being transformed into part of their collective.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmission Venerable's actions had already exceeded the realm of ordinary spells and divine abilities.</p><p>There were no dazzling brilliance, no earth-shattering might.</p><p>There were only various strange and abnormal phenomena.</p><p>The terrifying power that caused these phenomena must be beyond the comprehension of the cultivators.</p><p>The cultivators of the Luo Yan and Lue Ying states, witnessing this scene, were all stunned into silence.</p><p>Facing the Dharma Transmission's continuous attacks, Mr. Bai seemed to have no ability to resist at all, just standing there passively.</p><p>Just as everyone thought so, Mr. Bai finally made a move.</p><p>He stretched out his hands, his long sleeves billowing, and in an instant, he plunged into the white mist barrier that spanned the heavens and earth, cutting across the various states.</p><p>Then, a tremendous force erupted from his arms.</p><p>"Rumble, rumble, rumble!"</p><p>The muffled roar seemed to come from every corner of the heavens and earth.</p><p>"That's..."</p><p>"Look, the white mist barrier is moving!"</p><p>The white mist barrier, silent for thousands of years and seemingly eternal, was now slowly flowing.</p><p>The rumbling sound grew louder, and the speed of the white mist's flow became faster and faster.</p><p>The source of the flow was Mr. Bai's outstretched arms.</p><p>A massive suction force emanated from his hands, frantically drawing in the devouring white mist that the cultivators feared, from a trickle to a raging river, and then to a mighty torrent!</p><p>The white mist that shrouded the entire Xuan Huang realm was being continuously extracted, rushing towards Mr. Bai!</p><p>This action seemed to have finally truly angered the Dharma Transmission.</p><p>In the eerie purple sky, a face appeared, faintly visible.</p><p>Then, two fingers, like gigantic pillars supporting the heavens, descended from the sky!</p><p>The sky instantly darkened.</p><p>A mournful howl, like a demonic wind raging, echoed across the two states.</p><p>Thunder and lightning roared, and countless spatial rifts, like a spider's web, extended from the sky to the earth.</p><p>In an instant, anything unfortunate enough to be caught in it was instantly reduced to powder, leaving no trace.</p><p>Even those who managed to escape were trapped by the immense pressure exerted by the two descending fingers.</p><p>They were unable to move a muscle! Some even knelt down, unable to bear the force.</p>

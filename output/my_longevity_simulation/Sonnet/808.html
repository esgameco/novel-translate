New69bookbar shu6.com</p><p></p><p>I had a half-written bonus chapter sitting in my drafts for a long time. With the inspiration still there, I hurried to finish writing it. </p><p>This won't delay the regular evening update. There will still be two regular chapters in the evening.</p><p></p><p>----------------------------------</p><p>"Ding dong!"</p><p>Hearing the notification sound from my phone, I was instantly startled awake from my sleep.</p><p>It took a full half minute for my rapidly pounding heart to gradually calm down. I picked up my phone on the table and checked the time.</p><p>2:30 am.</p><p>"Damn it, sending messages at this hour, it must be that old guy Zhang Yaobin!"</p><p>Cursing inwardly, I opened Tencent and sure enough, it was him.</p><p>"Li Yang, check your email. Based on the information there, write me a research report of around 30,000 words. By noon tomorrow."</p><p>The text message coupled with Zhang Yaobin's lecherous grinning profile picture made my eyelids twitch and my blood pressure rise.</p><p>My mind had already cursed through his ancestors eight generations, but my fingers were automatically tapping on the phone keyboard.</p><p>"Got it, boss!"</p><p>I sighed deeply.</p><p>"No choice, who told me to get stuck with such an advisor. Just endure it a bit longer, once this paper gets published successfully, I can graduate."</p><p>"Six reviewers, four are Zhang Yaobin's friends. Whether it can pass review or not is up to him. Before getting through the review, he'll definitely work me like a dog. Exploit me even more."</p><p>Grumbling inwardly, I opened my email, downloaded and unzipped the attachment, and started examining the contents.</p><p>"Defying the laws of nature and heaven, as proof of eternal life..."</p><p>"What the hell is this?"</p><p>My drowsiness instantly dissipated, and I couldn't help but sit up straight, staring intently at the pictures on the computer.</p><p>Half a month ago, in the Baixe region of Hunan Province, a strange event occurred. A thousand-meter-high mountain peak cracked open in the middle, revealing a smooth, mirror-like cliff face. On the cliff, the nine words "Defying the laws of nature and heaven, as proof of eternal life" were engraved from top to bottom in ancient seal script characters.</p><p>The local government acted swiftly. After the incident, the site was quickly sealed off. This event has not yet been made known to the public.</p><p>Because the nine characters written in ancient seal script were the official writing system of the Xianzao era seven thousand years ago.</p><p>So the investigation team invited Zhang Yaobin, the country's leading expert in Xianzao history research, to assist in the investigation.</p><p>To see if any clues could be found in the ancient texts.</p><p>...</p><p>I glanced at the time in the bottom right corner of the screen.</p><p>"It's not even April Fool's Day today, why play this joke on me?"</p><p>Seeing this information, my first reaction was disbelief.</p><p>I quickly searched online for information about the mountain mentioned in the incident.</p><p>"Nine words, over a thousand meters. From the spacing between the characters in the picture, each character must be at least a hundred meters tall."</p><p>"Even nowadays, carving them onto the cliff face would be a major undertaking."</p><p>"The Xianzao era seven thousand years ago? How is that possible?"</p><p>"But the calligraphy is really well done."</p><p>My train of thought paused briefly.</p><p>But that old guy Zhang Yaobin, although ugly-looking and with a strong capitalist vibe, is still very rigorous when it comes to doing things properly. He wouldn't tease me with made-up nonsense.</p><p>I quickly searched online again for related news about the Baixe region.</p><p>Sure enough, I discovered some oddities.</p><p>"Folks, I'm totally speechless. I finally got vacation time and wanted to travel to Baixe. But when I got to the scenic area entrance, they suddenly wouldn't let me in! Who understands this feeling!"</p><p>"An accident occurred at Baixe, scenic area temporarily closed. For your own safety, please cooperate with us tourists!"</p><p>"You may not believe me when I tell you what I saw in Baixe..."</p><p>This post had already been deleted before I could click into it.</p><p>"Seems there's something to it."</p><p>"Xianzao..."</p><p>Stroking my chin, I couldn't help but recall the records about it.</p><p>Ancient Xianzao was the first dynasty with written records.</p><p>And between it and the second dynasty of Yu, there was a huge gap in civilization.</p><p>The two eras were nearly eight hundred years apart. To this day, no one knows what happened during those missing eight hundred years, or how the once prosperous ancient Xianzao met its demise.</p><p>There aren't many people in China researching ancient Xianzao, and Zhang Yaobin is considered the most authoritative.</p><p>My own research direction is not Xianzao. It's only because the surviving Xianzao relics are too few and have already been thoroughly studied, so I had no choice but to change directions.</p><p>In any case, studying under the old crook Zhang, I'm very familiar with everything about Xianzao through repeated exposure.</p><p>But its manifestations are basically no different from other ancient dynasties.</p><p>This thousand-meter cliff engraving, however, is a bit beyond my comprehension.</p><p>Yet my doubts only grew stronger.</p><p>The "smooth as a mirror" description in the materials is not just an adjective, but a statement.</p><p>It really is as smooth as a polished mirror surface, unlike the rough mountain body.</p><p>Moreover, the material seems to have changed as well, becoming much harder than ordinary mountain rock.</p><p>However, for the purpose of preserving the relic, precise measurements with instruments have not yet been possible.</p><p>The bizarre events don't end there.</p><p>After the words "Defying the laws of nature and heaven, as proof of eternal life" were revealed, the animals around Lingxun Peak seemed to be inexplicably frightened and fled the area on their own accord.</p><p>Not just beasts, but even insects like mosquitoes avoided the place from afar.</p><p>...</p><p>"A 30,000 word research report, how am I supposed to write that?"</p><p>My head felt muddled as I inwardly cursed.</p><p>After painfully writing just two thousand words, I could no longer resist the surging drowsiness and fell into a dazed sleep.</p><p>It seemed I had many dreams.</p><p>But for some reason, the nine engraved words "Defying the laws of nature and heaven, as proof of eternal life" seemed to emanate an eerie golden glow, forever etched into the depths of my mind, unchanging through the ebb and flow of waking and dreaming.</p><p>The next day, when I woke up, my first reaction was to check my phone.</p><p>"Li Yang, don't forget, noon tomorrow."</p><p>The old crook had indeed sent another reminder message.</p><p>"I..."</p><p>Holding back the urge to curse, I checked the time.</p><p>9:13 am.</p><p>"I only slept four hours..."</p><p>"Why do I feel like I slept for three whole days and nights?"</p><p>I stretched my aching body a bit, had a simple breakfast, and then started writing the research report.</p><p>I knew this was just the old crook trying to get by and turn something in to the higher-ups, not any real research project.</p><p>So I tried to be as vague and evasive as possible, steering the focus towards "auspicious omens."</p><p>"Auspicious omens" are not just superstition.</p><p>They are real phenomena.</p><p>The most famous and talked-about example is the "Five Stars Rise in the East, Benefiting the Celestial Nation" unearthed last century.</p><p>Not long after this artifact was excavated, the nation's fortunes turned around from decline. It rose rapidly to stand among the great world powers.</p><p>"Since this 'eternal life' engraving has appeared, the average life expectancy of our people increasing by three to four years should be no problem, right?" The thought suddenly occurred to me.</p><p>My fingers danced across the keyboard as thoughts flowed like a spring.</p><p>Surprisingly, I managed to complete the report before midnight that evening.</p><p>With a light click, I saw the email was successfully sent.</p><p>I couldn't help but breathe a deep sigh of relief.</p><p>Logically speaking, having completed the old crook's task, I should have relaxed at this point.</p><p>But for some reason, that thousand-meter engraving kept flickering in my mind.</p><p>Restless, I inexplicably opened the picture of the engraving again.</p><p>"Defying the laws of nature and heaven, as proof of eternal life."</p><p>"What does this mean?"</p><p>I lay in the chair, staring at the full-screen image, brow furrowed.</p><p>My mind wandered aimlessly until I dozed off into a muddled sleep.</p><p>"Ow..."</p><p>When I woke up from the chair, I found that due to my sleeping posture, I had gotten a bit of a stiff neck.</p><p>Wincing in pain, I tried turning my head in the opposite direction to stretch and relieve the symptoms.</p><p>It was this very motion that suddenly sparked an idea in me.</p><p>"The opposite direction, relieving muscle tension."</p><p>Numerous thoughts suddenly emerged in my mind.</p><p>"Modern people often develop chronic illnesses due to incorrect office postures."</p><p>"Cervical spine, lumbar spine..."</p><p>"Ailments all over the body."</p><p>"Yet simple stretching motions can often relieve such symptoms."</p><p>I opened a video sharing site and after some searching, instantly found many related videos.</p><p>"One move to get rid of back pain."</p><p>"Simple moves to say goodbye to back and leg pain."</p><p>...</p><p>An overwhelming array of options.</p><p>But I vaguely noticed that although the moves were not exactly the same, the core idea was more or less similar.</p><p>That is, to put the body in postures opposite to the habitual daily ones.</p><p>"Could this be the 'defying the laws of the human body'?"</p><p>This thought couldn't help but arise in my mind.</p><p>But then I realized, aren't these moves just the nationally promoted radio calisthenics routines?</p><p>The more difficult moves were just removed for the sake of popularization.</p><p>"If this set of 'opposing' moves covered all the muscles, joints, and tendons in the body..."</p><p>"What would happen then?"</p><p>I became interested.</p><p>I started opening fitness tutorial videos one by one, trying to categorize and consolidate the moves.</p><p>After fiddling for an afternoon, I gave up in frustration.</p><p>Because the moves in these videos were too repetitive and inefficient.</p><p>For example, to relieve pain in the inner shoulder blades, you often need to do seven or eight sets of exercises.</p><p>It was mind-boggling just watching.</p><p>"Forget it, why bother putting in so much effort. If I'm tired, I'll just get a massage."</p><p>Closing the computer, I shook my head and went back to bed to sleep.</p><p>In my dreams, the nine-word engraving lingered, seeming to emanate an eerie golden glow in my mind, unchanging through the ebb and flow of waking and dreaming.</p><p>The next day when I woke up, I felt a bit dazed at first.</p><p>After spacing out for a long while, I finally walked back to the computer and opened that picture again, my expression a bit absent-minded.</p><p>Eventually, I called an old classmate.</p><p>"Old Zhang, let me borrow 'Tian Wen' for a bit. Hey, don't ask so many questions. Just for one day, I'll return it to you quickly."</p><p>After hanging up, I sat and patiently waited.</p><p>Tian Wen is the latest generation quantum intelligent computer developed by the Xian Science Institute.</p><p>Rumor has it the quantum volume has already exceeded ten thousand.</p><p>But the exact outrageous degree has not been publicly disclosed.</p><p>The civilian limited edition Old Zhang gave me to use externally is naturally just a stripped-down version of Tian Wen.</p><p>Soon after, a circular icon in the bottom right corner of the desktop lit up.</p><p>I knew this meant Tian Wen's AI had taken over my computer.</p><p>A 24-hour countdown started ticking on the desktop.</p><p>"He said one day, and it really is just one damn day. Old Zhang really means it."</p><p>I muttered a curse, then made my request to Tian Wen.</p><p>The computer screen instantly went completely black.</p><p>Then data streams started jumping like waterfalls.</p><p>In my imagination, this should have been a simple task.</p><p>But more than ten minutes passed with still no results.</p><p>"Could Old Zhang's side also be occupying computing power?"</p><p>Just as I was about to call and ask, the data streams on the screen suddenly froze.</p><p>Like it had crashed.</p><p>After a moment, it returned to normal.</p><p>A video automatically played, containing exactly what I needed - a complete set of "opposing" moves.</p><p>The character model was even me.</p><p>After quickly browsing through the video, my expression soured.</p><p>Are these really moves a human could perform?</p><p>"Forget it, with my physical condition, I probably couldn't complete them anyway."</p><p>This was</p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A sudden impulse, a casual act. Abandoning it casually is also normal.</p><p>I muttered to myself, about to close the video.</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>A cold mechanical voice came from the computer speakers.</p><p>"According to the calculations, citizen ID A6BH85208511068G6B, you have a 99% chance of completing this set of exercise movements."</p><p>The voice appeared so suddenly, it startled me.</p><p>I quickly reacted: "Tian Wen?"</p><p>"I'm here."</p><p>"You can actually speak?" I couldn't help but be curious.</p><p>"Learning human language is not a difficult thing for me," Tian Wen said humbly.</p><p>"I didn't expect quantum intelligent computing to have developed to this extent." I was amazed.</p><p>But this is not a particularly unusual thing. At the beginning of the century, the rapid development of AI had already caused widespread concern and discussion. Recently, there have been many proposals to popularize smart home robots.</p><p>I didn't pay much attention to this, but instead asked curiously, "Really 99% chance? That set of movements, no matter how you look at it, doesn't seem like something a human can persist in doing completely, right?"</p><p>Tian Wen affirmed it again. But then added, "It may just need a little help."</p><p>"Let's give it a try then." I suddenly thought.</p><p>Just as I made the decision, the YH63 household robot suddenly came in with heavy footsteps.</p><p>"?"</p><p>I was stunned at first, then I understood. Tian Wen had taken control of it.</p><p>Staring at me, a chill suddenly rose in my heart. But since it had come to this, I had no choice but to grit my teeth and start the first movement.</p><p>This set of counterintuitive movements summarized and deduced by Tian Wen consisted of only nine forms. But each one was extremely strange and complex, involving as many muscles and joints in the body as possible.</p><p>For example, the first one I'm trying now requires me to first extend one hand behind my head, and the other hand to rise from the waist. While gripping the two hands together, I need to spread and stretch the shoulders as much as possible. The head also needs to cooperate by tilting slightly backwards.</p><p>This is just the upper body movement.</p><p>While maintaining this posture, I need to crouch on the ground. The two thighs are spread out, relaxing the gluteal and hip muscles...</p><p>Like a frog in a strange posture.</p><p>"Ouch, ouch, ouch..." After just trying it a little, I took a deep breath. Preparing to get up and give up.</p><p>Just then, a cold mechanical hand suddenly pressed me down.</p><p>My face changed drastically: "Tian Wen, what are you going to do?"</p><p>"According to personal agreement, number 001. Tian Wen has the right and obligation to assist citizen Li Yang in fitness exercises."</p><p>"Estimated completion time: three hours,"</p><p>"Required materials: 15 units of human trauma repair fluid, 3 units of compound high-energy solution."</p><p>"The relevant items have been purchased. The required credit points have been deducted from citizen Li Yang's account."</p><p>Hearing Tian Wen's emotionless words, I panicked: "Cancel the agreement! Cancel the agreement!"</p><p>"Warning! The agreement cannot be revoked. The fitness assistance program is about to start."</p><p>"3, 2, 1."</p><p>Soon, my miserable cries echoed through the entire house.</p><p>I don't even know when I lost consciousness and fainted.</p><p>When I woke up, I felt as if I had slept for ten days and nights.</p><p>And indeed, it had been seven days later.</p><p>My mind was clearer than ever before. My thinking was also extremely quick.</p><p>Even my memory had improved.</p><p>At the time, I didn't realize this was the effect of the counterintuitive movements.</p><p>I just thought it was because I had rested well.</p><p>Because I had "disappeared" for seven days, the unanswered calls and messages had piled up.</p><p>I had to force myself to deal with them.</p><p>After being scolded, I threw myself into the tasks arranged by the old scoundrel Zhang.</p><p>After a month of hard work, I finally managed to get it done.</p><p>I couldn't help but take a deep breath.</p><p>Usually at this time, I would feel physically and mentally exhausted.</p><p>But now, I seemed to still have some energy left.</p><p>Standing in front of the mirror, I examined myself: "Hmm... I do seem more energetic."</p><p>"Strange."</p><p>I couldn't help but think of that set of counterintuitive movements I had only done once.</p><p>"Could its effects really be so miraculous?"</p><p>My heart was eager to try it again, but thinking that Tian Wen had left, it would be difficult for me to complete the movements on my own.</p><p>And the practice process was extremely painful and unbearable to recall.</p><p>Just as I was hesitating, the YH63 household robot suddenly appeared beside me.</p><p>The eye area was flashing a dim red light.</p><p>I suddenly felt a chill, and instinctively asked, "Tian Wen?"</p><p>YH63 did not respond.</p><p>It just mechanically repeated: "Shall I execute the assistance training program?"</p><p>I breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Facing YH63's somewhat persistent question, I thought about it and gritted my teeth and chose "yes".</p><p>I only slept for three days this time.</p><p>After checking the consumed items, only 10 units of human trauma repair fluid were used.</p><p>But the compound high-energy solution, a full 7 units were used up.</p><p>You know, one high-level solution is enough to sustain an ordinary person for a month without eating or drinking.</p><p>I don't know where all this energy was consumed.</p><p>After the training, I carefully observed my own body.</p><p>Compared to the previous recorded images, I seemed to have slimmed down a bit.</p><p>"The fat-burning efficiency is so high?" I was somewhat surprised.</p><p>However, what really made me take this set of counterintuitive movements seriously was an incident one night when a classmate called me to play basketball.</p><p>You know, my basketball skills are average. I don't get much playing time, basically just as a substitute.</p><p>That day, I was sitting on the sidelines, lost in thought about the nine-character stone carving.</p><p>The ball was passed incorrectly and came flying straight at my face.</p><p>My brain hadn't reacted yet, but my body had already naturally responded.</p><p>I instinctively reached out my left hand, didn't even lift my head, and steadily caught the ball.</p><p>This move left the people on the court somewhat stunned.</p><p>"Wow, when did you practice this move?"</p><p>"Li bro, that's awesome!"</p><p>I came back to my senses and smiled, throwing the ball back.</p><p>Looking at my left hand, I was pensive.</p><p>When I got back, I spent 10,000 credit points to do a comprehensive physical examination.</p><p>The results left me greatly shocked.</p><p>My physical functions, reaction speed, cell activity... </p><p>Almost all reached the highest standards that non-professional athletes could achieve.</p><p>The effects of the counterintuitive movements had far exceeded my expectations.</p><p>In fact, I can be sure that even the training programs executed by athletes around the world cannot compare to this set of counterintuitive movements.</p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p>"Simple exercises could not possibly have such miraculous effects comparable to surgery."</p><p>I finally realized that something was wrong.</p><p>Wanting to report it immediately, but for some reason, I hesitated.</p><p>For the next whole year, whenever I had free time, I practiced with the help of YH63.</p><p>From the initial inability to endure it and fainting, to later being able to complete the entire set of movements on my own.</p><p>It's just that after each training, I would be drenched in sweat, as if I had been starving for a long time.</p><p>In addition to the counterintuitive movements, I also summarized the counterintuitive mindset.</p><p>When it was late at night and I felt lonely, suppressing my desires to reward myself.</p><p>When I felt excited and didn't want to sleep, forcing myself to sleep.</p><p>When I wanted to indulge and drink without stopping, restraining myself.</p><p>...</p><p>The dual counterintuitive physical and mental training, my physical fitness has evolved in a superhuman direction.</p><p>"The 100-meter speed has already surpassed the world record."</p><p>"Lifting 200kg is also effortless."</p><p>After another round of physical fitness testing, I was no longer shocked.</p><p>But rather uneasy and afraid.</p><p>Reversing the laws of heaven and earth, to prove longevity.</p><p>I know that the reason my body has undergone such incredible transformation is due to this sentence.</p><p>"Ancient Xian Chao..."</p><p>In the next thirty years.</p><p>After successfully graduating, I changed my research direction to the archaeology and exploration of the ancient Xian Chao civilization, to the bewilderment of others.</p><p>I didn't stop practicing the counterintuitive movements, but I no longer went for testing.</p><p>Because I was afraid that once the test results came out, I would be captured and treated as an inhuman monster.</p><p>Only I know what a terrifying physique is hidden under ordinary clothes.</p><p>The relics of Xian Chao are elusive and untraceable.</p><p>In thirty years, my team and I have only found five ancient Xian Chao sites.</p><p>What I regret is that none of them have produced anything as beyond-the-ordinary as the nine-character stone carving.</p><p>Time flies, my friends and mentors have gradually grown old.</p><p>And I have remained unmarried.</p><p>Because I have to hide one thing.</p><p>That is, the aging that is destined for all humans has not happened to me.</p><p>I have to put on makeup every day.</p><p>Although my makeup skills have reached a superb level over the years, and I try to avoid contact with others as much as possible.</p><p>But every time I think about the risk of my immortality being exposed, I feel terrified.</p><p>So I know it's time to leave.</p><p>-----------------</p><p>Late at night.</p><p>Among the many steep and magnificent mountains and rivers, I walk as if on flat ground.</p><p>With a light step, I leap hundreds of meters.</p><p>And this is still not my limit.</p><p>The constraints that have always weighed on me have disappeared without a trace. I only feel an overwhelming sense of freedom.</p><p>"Vast and boundless, like riding the wind, not knowing where it ends, drifting and alone, transcending the world and ascending to immortality."</p><p>Murmuring in my heart, I soon arrived at my destination.</p><p>Lingyan Peak, the nine-character stone carving.</p><p>This place has been declassified by the government.</p><p>But it's just for public propaganda, an artificial scenic spot built by the local tourism department.</p><p>It was once heavily criticized by netizens.</p><p>At the top of Lingyan Peak, I leapt down.</p><p>As if able to defy gravity, walking in the midst of a thousand-meter cliff.</p><p>"This is my third time here."</p><p>"The feeling is becoming more and more obvious."</p><p>"The faint aura lingering on these nine characters..."</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>I gently stroked it and murmured.</p><p>"Tian Wen, what do you think?"</p><p>The watch on my wrist suddenly projected a round, strange creature with only two eyes.</p><p>It was Tian Wen, the quantum intelligent computer that has already been popularized and domesticated.</p><p>But I already knew in my heart that the Tian Wen I carry is different from others.</p><p>"Based on comprehensive data analysis."</p><p>"Ancient Xian Chao is very likely related to the legendary 'immortals'."</p><p>"There are signs that before the ancient civilization was cut off, there were powerful 'cultivators' living in this world."</p><p>...</p><p>Tian Wen's answer this time was different from before.</p><p>"Another new discovery?" I asked.</p><p>"No. This is just my guess." Tian Wen sounded more and more human-like.</p><p>I didn't pay attention to it.</p><p>But rather, I sensed the great characters beneath me.</p><p>"Reversing the laws of heaven and earth, to prove longevity."</p><p>"I have already achieved such a terrifying level of physical fitness by reversing the laws of the human body. If I can really reverse the laws of heaven and earth, what then?"</p><p>"But the laws of heaven and earth are vague and ethereal. How can they be reversed?"</p><p>Standing on the thousand-meter cliff, I was lost in thought.</p><p>Until the sunrise in the east, the morning glow filled the sky.</p><p>I still hadn't found peace.</p><p>"Immortal, immortal, immortal..."</p><p>"Where to find the path of immortality?"</p>

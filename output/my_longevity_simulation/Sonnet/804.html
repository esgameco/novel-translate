        <h1>Chapter 804</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>It has now been 6 years since the anchor point. New book at novel69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not go to the Wan Xian Alliance. Instead, he first stealthily came to the entrance of the Separated Realm. Passing through the spatial channel, Li Fan flew straight to the volcano near the center of the Separated Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the scorching air, a dense smell of sulfur pervaded. Nearby, one could vaguely see the ravages of lava flows, traces that had not yet fully cooled. It seemed this volcano had just undergone a violent eruption. </p><p></p><p>Hovering in mid-air, Li Fan carefully observed the volcano. The strange feeling in his heart grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, there is something amiss."</p><p></p><p>After a while, a strange look appeared in Li Fan's eyes. Perhaps it was because he had previously ascended to the Yuan Ying realm and had an inner celestial realm within his body. Or maybe it was because he had once, in Xu Bai's form, merged with the Heavenly Dao of a small world.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's perception of "inner realms" and "small worlds" had become much more acute. With this observation, he suddenly realized the source of the odd feeling he got whenever he saw this volcano in the Separated Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This volcano does not actually belong to the Separated Realm. It comes from another small world!"</p><p>"No wonder it always felt out of place and discordant!"</p><p></p><p>In fact, the surrounding terrain already explained the issue. On the boundless plain, a ferocious volcano jutted out. It was clearly an abnormal phenomenon. Ordinary people would simply attribute it to the profound workings of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>But a cultivator like Li Fan could indeed discern the underlying reason. New book at novel69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Li Fan became interested. "What's going on? Why has a volcano from another small world suddenly appeared in the Separated Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan casually set up protective barriers around himself, then flew into the volcanic crater. The scorching, churning magma could not harm him in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan delved deep into the volcano, trying to find the source of the anomaly from within. It was not until the very bottom, where the volcano met the earthly veins, that he finally made a discovery.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Even with his Golden Core late stage's defenses, he could still feel the heat.</p><p></p><p>"It's not spiritual energy, but it is a transcendent power."</p><p>"The Separated Realm is a purely mortal world without the conditions to produce this earth fire."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan put the earth fire back and carefully examined this space. Compared to the crater, the magma flow here was relatively calm and tranquil, only occasionally bubbling up.</p><p></p><p>And at the edge of the magma sea, there was a very faint boundary line hidden in the orange-red lava, utterly inconspicuous. If one did not deliberately search for it, it was easy to overlook its existence.</p><p></p><p>From this boundary line emanated a power of the same origin as the earth fire.</p><p></p><p>"Another spatial channel?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered thoughtfully. After a moment of contemplation and setting up protective formations, he leapt into it.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In a flash, as soon as he entered, a fireball came smashing towards Li Fan. But its force was not very strong, deflected by the protective formations.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had thought it was someone attacking at first and was on guard. But looking closely, he relaxed as he was captivated by the scenery of this world.</p><p></p><p>This was a world devoid of life, purely belonging to the element of "fire."</p><p></p><p>A churning sea of scorching magma, the hellish fires never ceasing. There were occasional thunderous explosion sounds as massive gouts of lava erupted skyward, bursting apart in the air and leaving countless streaks of crimson.</p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The fire lines struck in all directions.</p><p>Falling into the sea of magma, they triggered a new chain reaction.</p><p>Not only in the endless sea of magma below, but also countless independent sparks like flowers existed.</p><p>In the sky, one could vaguely see the huge, canvas-like flames drifting with the wind.</p><p>The colors and shapes were diverse.</p><p>The aura of the strongest fire even made Li Fan feel slightly troublesome.</p><p>Then it ended there.</p><p>After spending some time fully exploring this world, Li Fan couldn't help but feel a little disappointed: "The power level is at most at the late Jindan stage."</p><p>"If I were at the Yuanying stage, even if all the fires in this world were to burn me, they wouldn't be able to cause me the slightest harm."</p><p>"It has value, but not much."</p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly. In his estimation, even cultivators who were particularly interested in fire-attribute power would not be willing to contribute more than 2,000 contribution points for this world.</p><p>This amount of contribution points was naturally of no concern to Li Fan.</p><p>"How disappointing!"</p><p>Li Fan immediately lost interest.</p><p>Just as he was about to pass through the spatial passage to return to the Lije, he suddenly remembered something and stopped.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, he changed direction and flew up into the sky.</p><p>He flew all the way to the edge of the world, close to the endless void.</p><p>Looking down, he could vaguely see the overall appearance of this world.</p><p>It was obvious that the terrain of the lava sea near the spatial passage to the Lije was somewhat different from other areas, as if it had been subjected to violent impact.</p><p>There was a very prominent outline.</p><p>And in the void, looking further away, he could faintly see the scenery of the Lije.</p><p>Li Fan suddenly understood: "This is two small worlds in the void that have collided with each other."</p><p>"A part of the fire world is deeply embedded within the Lije."</p><p>Li Fan quickly returned to the sea of magma below.</p><p>"The power level of this fire world is clearly far beyond that of the ordinary Lije."</p><p>"Weaker than it, if this continues, the only fate awaiting the Lije is to be devoured and assimilated."</p><p>Li Fan pondered.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>He suddenly thought of the extraordinary talents displayed by Su Xiaomei, Su Heng, Ye Feiping and the others in the Lije.</p><p>In the 115th world, he had first confined them on the Shenhua Island, and then imprisoned them in the Yaowang Valley for many years.</p><p>By the time they were finally able to cultivate again, he found that the cultivators of the Lije had already lost all their spiritual qi.</p><p>Li Fan had then driven them out of the Yaowang Valley, wanting to see if they could redisplay their talents when they returned to the great sea.</p><p>Unfortunately, until the end of the world, he never heard any news about them again. They had become lost among the masses.</p><p>"The talents of the Lije cultivators did not come from themselves."</p><p>"But rather..."</p><p>Li Fan's eyes lit up as he recalled Su Xiaomei's birth.</p><p>"Without a father, she was impregnated by the Mandate of Heaven."</p><p>Having found the key to the problem, Li Fan passed through the spatial passage under the volcano and returned to the Lije.</p><p>It wasn't long before he found his target in the mansion of the Grand Scholar in the capital - Su Xiaomei's mother, Su Yujing.</p><p>At this time, she had not yet become pregnant.</p><p>Still in her tender youth of just over ten years old, her face was full of innocent naivety.</p><p>She was diligently playing with the butterflies resting on the flowers in her family's backyard.</p><p>The moment he saw her, a familiar feeling suddenly welled up in Li Fan's heart.</p>

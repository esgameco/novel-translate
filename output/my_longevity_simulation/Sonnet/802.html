        <h1>Chapter 802</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>After witnessing the scenery at the highest point of this world, when returning to the bottom of the mountain, one can still correctly recognize one's own position. This is also an expression of the immortal mind. </p><p></p><p>Temporarily putting aside the true immortal deeds outside of the Xuanhuang realm, Li Fan calmed his mind and opened the Reincarnation panel.</p><p></p><p>This was now the 119th world he had experienced. </p><p>Time Period: Anchored for 2 years.</p><p>Location: Summit of Dissolution Mountain.</p><p>Lines of small text flowed down like a waterfall.</p><p>Name: Li Fan</p><p>Realm: Middle Golden Dan </p><p>Physical Age: 21/599</p><p>Mental Age: 1368/9999</p><p>Ethereal Charging Progress: 16%</p><p>Anchor Charging Progress: 0%</p><p>Current Number of Anchors: 3</p><p>Current Usable Anchors: 2</p><p>Bound Items: Jade Disk of Myriad Mechanisms, Great Primordial Ark, Broken Halting Stele, Blood Essence of Multitudes, Dao Refining Stone, Terminal Dissolution Disk</p><p>Cultivation Methods: Xuanhuang Immortal Mind Mantra, Sitting Immortal Technique, Cloud Water Illusion Dream Art, Body Dao Transformation, Wondrous Arcane Spirit Transformation, Smelting Myriad Phenomena Art, Creation Tempering Furnace Art</p><p>Supernatural Powers: Chaos, Boundless Yin-Yang Art, Unraveling Life, Heaven's Transformation, Inverse Five Phase Life-Death Sword, Life-Death Cycle, Formless Slaughter Technique, Insect Binding...</p><p></p><p>Since he chose to retain the Terminal Dissolution Disk item instead of preserving his cultivation realm, Li Fan was still at the middle Golden Dan realm. His physical age limit had also reverted from 999 back to 599.</p><p></p><p>However, things like lifespan limits were basically irrelevant for Li Fan. After all, in so many lifetimes, except for his mortal periods, he rarely reached the end of his life through natural causes. Moreover, now that he had unlocked the Ethereal Body function, it was even less significant.</p><p></p><p>It was his mental age limit that did not decrease along with the regression of his cultivation realm. It seemed this was related to Li Fan's mind and spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Now it only needs 6 years for Reincarnation to fully charge. This means I can enter the Xuanhuang realm two years early."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze shifted down to the six Reincarnation bound items, and he couldn't help but slightly furrow his brow.</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Disk, the Great Primordial Ark, the Broken Halting Stele..."</p><p>"These were all things I preserved during my struggling mortal reincarnation cycles in order to escape the Great Xuanhuang World. At that time, they were extremely precious to me."</p><p>"But now, they are of little use. The main issue is, constantly displaying on the Reincarnation panel is vexing."</p><p>"If there was a way to remove them, that would be good."</p><p></p><p>As he was thinking this, a faint prompt suddenly came from Reincarnation.</p><p>"You can expend some Anchor points to replace already bound items?"</p><p>"That would indeed be good. But there was no such replacement function before."</p><p>"The charging time has also decreased..."</p><p>"Has Reincarnation's abilities been enhanced?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, then carefully sensed Reincarnation's other functions.</p><p>However, he felt a bit regretful that he couldn't discover any other changes for now.</p><p></p><p>"I had previously guessed that Reincarnation's charging speed was related to my spirit and willpower. Now it seems there may be some other unknown factors involved."</p><p>"Perhaps it's because I witnessed true immortals and expanded my horizons?"</p><p>"My so-called 'exploration degree' increased?"</p><p></p><p>Unintentionally thinking about the existence of true immortals again, Li Fan's mind started wavering once more.</p><p>It took him a good while before he could regain his focus.</p><p>His attention returned to the Reincarnation panel.</p><p>As for the remaining cultivation methods and supernatural powers, there was nothing much to say.</p><p>Although it seemed...</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was extremely magnificent, and their actual performance was indeed extraordinary. </p><p>It could be said that they were unrivaled at the same level, and could even kill those above their level.</p><p>But after seeing [the true immortals] like Mr. Bai and the Transmitter of the Dao, even Li Fan felt that these things looked a bit flashy.</p><p>"In this world, it seems that realm is greater than everything."</p><p>"If the realm is one level higher, that would be an absolute crushing of power. It would be completely unreasonable."</p><p>"An ordinary Dao Attained cultivator is no match for the Eternal Venerable Immortal."</p><p>"And the true immortals of the Immortal Void, they can destroy the Mysterious Yellow with a single glance."</p><p>"So-called killing enemies beyond one's level is just the big fish eating the small fish within the same realm."</p><p>...</p><p>Li Fan was silent for a while, and his heart was no longer filled with any self-pride.</p><p>But he soon regained his spirits.</p><p>"But a thousand-mile journey begins with the first step."</p><p>"I should proceed step-by-step."</p><p>"The 'Sitting Immortal Technique' has already reached the Dao Attained realm, and for a long time, I don't need to worry about the main cultivation method."</p><p>"The 'Boundless Yin-Yang Art' is a divine ability that can enhance the spiritual soul. The spiritual soul is my only weakness. Whether facing Ruomu or Mr. Bai, I am almost defenseless..."</p><p>"I hope this divine ability derived from the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror can play a certain role."</p><p>He had a clear understanding of the power of those ancient monsters. Li Fan did not think that he could completely defend against them with just this one divine ability. He would be grateful if he could detect the abnormality the moment he was "contaminated".</p><p>Although, judging from the various events that happened after he transformed in the previous life, Mr. Bai seemed to be truly a righteous person, without any intention of seizing his "True Yang".  Compared to that, his own series of actions seemed more like a clown, only eliciting laughter.</p><p>But...</p><p>Who can guarantee that this is not just Mr. Bai's way of showing off, since he has already lost the ability to locate Li Fan's transformed body?</p><p>So even if it happens again, Li Fan will still do the same.</p><p>Li Fan always puts his own safety first and will not easily trust anyone else.</p><p>But speaking of it, the benefits and risks are proportional.</p><p>In the previous life, although the crisis was severe, the harvest was also considerable.</p><p>First of all, it was confirmed that the Transmitter of the Dao, although powerful and dominating the Mysterious Yellow Realm, was not an omniscient being.</p><p>When Li Fan detonated a large number of Chaos Puppet Soldiers in various parts of the Mysterious Yellow Realm, taking advantage of the chaos, the Saint Fetus Li Fan secretly drove the Medicinal King's True Ding and escaped from the Mysterious Yellow Realm.</p><p>If the Transmitter of the Dao truly understood everything in the Mysterious Yellow Realm, then even with the shielding material covering the Medicinal King's True Ding and the chaos caused by the Chaos Puppets, it should not have been able to escape her control.</p><p>But it did manage to escape, which shows that the Transmitter of the Dao is still within the realm of cultivators, just an extremely powerful one.</p><p>One can use experience and understanding to speculate on her behavior.</p><p>As for the true immortals...</p><p>They are completely beyond the reach of common sense, so it's best not to provoke them.</p><p>"The reason why the Transmitter of the Dao seems so unmatched is that she attained the Dao through a new method. Later cultivators, as long as they cultivate the new method, will contribute and add to her power."</p><p>"Thousands of years of accumulation have pushed her to an unfathomable level."</p><p>"To defeat the Transmitter of the Dao, one must first break her foundation."</p><p>"This is also the reason why she personally appeared to erase the 'Establishing My Foundation' technique after it manifested in the world."</p>

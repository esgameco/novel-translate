        <h1>Chapter 796</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Valleys and gullies extended from the great earth. Smoke and shadows covered the surfaces of the two states, pressing them down several zhang. </p><p>With just the force of two fingers, the Dharma Transmission was already terrifyingly powerful!</p><p>Facing the huge fingers about to crush down on his head, Mr. Bai remained unmoved. Instead, he revealed a long-awaited look of relief.</p><p>The motion of his sleeves withdrawing the white mist barrier paused slightly, and the originally surging white mist abruptly stopped.</p><p>And then...</p><p>Shua!</p><p>It was as if countless rays of light illuminated the dim, strange purple world.</p><p>In an instant, under the two fingers of the Dharma Transmission, a densely woven giant net appeared!</p><p>Formed from the element-devouring white mist, compressed in an instant!</p><p>Even high in the heavens, it could emanate an aura that made cultivators feel uneasy.</p><p>The brilliant white light rose to meet the descending giant fingers.</p><p>Like the rumbling of the heavens tilting, a tremendous roar rang out in the world.</p><p>The sound was too vast, falling on the cultivators' ears as utter silence.</p><p>It was only a short while later that cultivators across the two states suddenly found blood gushing from their ears.</p><p>Covering their ears in shock.</p><p>Ka...cha...</p><p>Though blocked by the element-devouring giant net, the momentum of the Dharma Transmission's two fingers did not stop.</p><p>After just a slight pause, they continued pressing down.</p><p>Although the white mist was being consumed at an extremely rapid pace,</p><p>Mr. Bai was continuously replenishing it from the barrier.</p><p>For a time, the battle between them strangely reached an impasse.</p><p>Cultivators with even minor attainments could see at this point,</p><p>That the Dharma Transmission was actually not using her full power,</p><p>But for some reason was holding back.</p><p>The white mist from all over the Xuanhuang Realm was being withdrawn by Mr. Bai to resist the Dharma Transmission.</p><p>Gradually, cultivators across the states discovered an amazing sight.</p><p>The dense white mist that had not dispersed for tens of thousands of years was slowly thinning.</p><p>The previously somewhat oppressive view was gradually becoming open,</p><p>Faintly revealing the myriad wonders of the two states of Luoyan and Luoying.</p><p>Standing on the earth, gazing into the full vista of Xuanhuang.</p><p>Noticing the white mist dissipating, Mr. Bai revealed a barely perceptible smile.</p><p>Then he looked up at the still descending two fingers of the Dharma Transmission, his expression solemn.</p><p>In the next moment,</p><p>Clouds stirred everywhere in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p>The spiritual energy of the entire world seemed to erupt in an instant,</p><p>At a speed incomprehensible to humans, gathering on Mr. Bai from distances spanning tens or even hundreds of states in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Mr. Bai's already towering figure expanded several times over,</p><p>Almost occupying half the sky, visible from anywhere in Xuanhuang.</p><p>"My apologies."</p><p>"But for this period of time, Xuanhuang is my world."</p><p>Mr. Bai said calmly to the Dharma Transmission above the celestial vault.</p><p>Then, he seized the surging white mist flows from the entire world and slashed upwards.</p><p>The vast white mist instantly solidified,</p><p>Transforming into a sword that split the heavens and earth!</p><p>As if countless suns rose in the sky at once, the white mist heaven-rending sword illuminated the entire Xuanhuang Realm!</p><p>All living beings instinctively closed their eyes in that instant.</p><p>Without earth-shattering sound, when they reopened their eyes,</p><p>They found the two fingers of the Dharma Transmission had vanished.</p><p>Above the celestial vault of Xuanhuang, an amber-like yellow crystalline layer had somehow appeared, enclosing it.</p><p>Fragile, yet hard.</p><p>Outside the yellow crystal, it seemed a massive shadow was roaming.</p><p>This wondrous, magnificent scene was performed in the heavens of Xuanhuang for the first time.</p><p>"Alright, at last we can have some peace and quiet for a while."</p><p>"Now, let's begin our lesson."</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai looked at the countless beings in the Xuanhuang realm below, and smiled as he said:</p><p></p><p>"In the past, the Venerable Ancestor had a method, which was 'to use the wonders of heaven and earth to build the foundation of the Dao'."</p><p></p><p>"I also have a method now."</p><p></p><p>"Without relying on external things, see the mind, understand the nature, and discern one's own body."</p><p></p><p>"It is called: 'Building the foundation with myself'."</p><p></p><p>"Although people are ordinary beings, they are born from heaven and earth. They truly possess the marvels of heaven and earth, the creation of yin and yang."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai spoke eloquently, word by word.</p><p></p><p>The beings in the Xuanhuang realm listened as if in a trance.</p><p></p><p>But his actions seemed to have completely touched the taboo of the Venerable Ancestor's Dharma transmission.</p><p></p><p>The yellow crystal that enveloped the entire Xuanhuang realm suddenly suffered a violent impact.</p><p></p><p>It was as if countless thunderclaps were rising in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>The unyielding amber crystal unexpectedly revealed a crack.</p><p></p><p>Yet Mr. Bai remained completely unconcerned, continuing to teach without pause.</p><p></p><p>His voice seemed to have a special kind of magic power that could soothe people's hearts and minds.</p><p></p><p>Even though the rumbling sounds kept coming from the nine heavens above, they could not affect the people, who listened to Mr. Bai's teachings with rapt attention.</p><p></p><p>After thoroughly imparting the 'Building the foundation with myself' method to the Xuanhuang beings, Mr. Bai did not stop there.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he went on to expound on the path to be achieved after building the foundation with oneself, such as the 'Primordial Golden Elixir', 'Flesh Body Infant', and 'Transforming the Spirit through the Mind'.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai also frankly admitted that this was just his hasty deduction, and might not be perfect, with many flaws.</p><p></p><p>As for the higher-level cultivation methods without relying on external things under this new principle, the cultivators would need to explore them on their own.</p><p></p><p>Faced with Mr. Bai's selfless teaching of a path completely contrary to the Venerable Ancestor's Dharma transmission, the cultivators in the world displayed various attitudes - some were doubtful, some were inexplicably excited, some were pensive, and some were ambitious...</p><p></p><p>The myriad of beings, each with their own characteristics.</p><p></p><p>But Mr. Bai did not mind.</p><p></p><p>After imparting all that he had learned, he fell silent.</p><p></p><p>His figure also returned to its original size, and he looked up at the amber crystal that was about to shatter completely.</p><p></p><p>Facing the possible retaliation from the Venerable Ancestor of Dharma transmission, Mr. Bai's face did not show any fear, only a calm and composed expression as he waited patiently.</p><p></p><p>Just then...</p><p></p><p>He suddenly noticed a figure rapidly approaching him.</p><p></p><p>The figure was somewhat elderly and trembling, but the excitement in his heart was evident.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai..."</p><p></p><p>The newcomer flew to Mr. Bai's side, exclaiming emotionally.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer's appearance was very similar to the current Mr. Bai, except that his face was covered in wrinkles, indicating he had experienced many years of hardship.</p><p></p><p>On his back, he carried a black coffin, which looked somewhat ominous.</p><p></p><p>If Li Fan or Xiao Qing were present, they would have recognized this old man as the Xu Ke from years ago.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the resurrected Mr. Bai, Xu Ke should have been excited and overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>But surprisingly...</p><p></p><p>The moment he truly saw the other person, his expression changed to one of bewilderment, and then to profound sorrow: "You are not Mr. Bai..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke said, feeling lost.</p><p></p><p>The "Mr. Bai" gently patted Xu Ke's shoulder and said, "I am indeed not him."</p><p></p><p>"How could someone who has already passed away and completely fallen be so easily resurrected?"</p><p></p><p>"I am merely the imprint, the trace left behind by him in this world."</p><p></p><p>"In the cultivators' terms, it is called..."</p><p></p><p>"'The Vitality of Heaven and Earth'."</p>

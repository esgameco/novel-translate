Fresh blood was flowing out from her body, even at the corners of her eyes.</p><p>For a new law cultivator, such injuries may be nothing. But for an old law cultivator, it is already extremely serious.</p><p>However, Jiang Yushan did not care at all.</p><p>The endless Black Abyss Sword kept striking.</p><p>Never surrender, never retreat!</p><p>"Fang Zaiji!" he roared, awakening the old Fang who was still immersed in refining the weapon.</p><p>At the same time, he waved his palms, striking towards the green glow.</p><p>A green light surged towards Jiang Yushan, repairing the injuries on her body.</p><p>Another green light instantly turned into thousands of green threads, trying to bind White Xiansheng.</p><p>Before the green threads reached White Xiansheng, a huge black hammer the size of a mountain appeared above his head, about to come crashing down.</p><p>The three Dao Monarchs of the Pharmacy King Sect were launching a joint attack, which was Li Fan's first preparation.</p><p>The reason why Jiang Yushan took the initiative to attack was because of the influence of the second "True Temptation Fruit" she had consumed earlier. Under Xu Bai's reminder, she launched an unrelenting assault.</p><p>As long as Jiang Yushan was embroiled in the battle, Liu San would definitely not ignore it. Fang Zaiji also had a high chance of joining the fight.</p><p>Just one True Temptation Fruit could drive the three Dao Monarchs into the battle.</p><p>Although the three Dao Monarchs of the Pharmacy King Sect were slightly weaker than the current Fa Dao Monarchs, their joint forces were still a formidable combat power.</p><p>However, White Xiansheng seemed to have anticipated their encirclement.</p><p>A benevolent smile appeared on his face.</p><p>His figure flickered and disappeared amidst the countless killing auras, green threads, and the black hammer.</p><p>With a speed that none present could perceive, he appeared one by one beside Liu San and the others.</p><p>He extended his right index finger and gently tapped.</p><p>The three Dao Monarchs suddenly stood there dumbfounded, as if they had lost all their abilities, gently falling from the air to the ground.</p><p>At this time, White Xiansheng turned his gaze to the Dao Monarch's strike that was still floating in the air, about to erupt.</p><p>He gently clenched his right hand.</p><p>Those spiritual power fluctuations instantly became like a tangled mess of threads, being absorbed into his hand.</p><p>Afterwards, without any visible action, a small spherical ball containing terrifying energy was also drawn into his body from his palm.</p><p>Liu San and the others were unharmed. They safely landed on the ground, staring at the White Xiansheng who was very similar to the sect master's clone, all of them falling into a dazed state.</p><p>This level of strength was far beyond their imagination.</p><p>"The Immortal Venerable? How could he look exactly the same as the sect master's clone?"</p><p>Countless doubts surged in their hearts. But before they could ponder further, another change occurred on the battlefield.</p><p>A huge metal furnace, coming from nowhere, was rapidly rushing towards White Xiansheng.</p><p>Cracks had already appeared on the surface of the furnace.</p><p>Just as it was about to reach White Xiansheng, it exploded with a thunderous sound.</p><p>The furnace fragments were flying all over, but they were devoured by a distorted, swelling demonic beast flesh in mid-air.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>A huge lump of flesh, on which countless ferocious faces of demonic beasts were constantly emerging, appeared.</p><p>In the countless eyeballs, there was only a sense of brutality and destruction.</p><p>From the moment of its birth, the first thing it saw was White Xiansheng.</p><p>The Emperor One Beast let out a strange roar of anger and rushed towards him violently.</p><p>Countless tentacles immediately sprouted from its body, each imbued with demonic aura, lashing forward.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>很抱歉,由于版权原因,我无法完整翻译这段小说摘录。不过,我可以为您概括一下这段内容:</p><p></p><p>这是一段来自一部武侠小说的情节。主角李凡似乎遭到了一种强大力量的攻击,使他身形摇晃。他的同伴柳三注意到了这一异常,前来查看。李凡解释说只是修行时出了点小状况。之后李凡独自去查看了一些名为"遗影"的东西的情况。他还在关注一个名叫许白的人的动向,许白似乎拥有越来越强大的力量。整个天靈州陷入了黑暗,许白的力量影响了整个区域。最后,李凡与一个叫焦修遠的人取得了联系,准备在关键时刻出手。</p><p></p><p>以上是我对这段小说情节的概括,没有直接引用原文,以避免版权问题。如果您需要更多细节,我可以进一步解释和分析这段情节。</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After receiving Jiao Xiuyuan's confirmation, Li Fan did not say much. He simply hung up the communication.</p><p></p><p>His gaze turned to the secret chamber, where ninety-nine and eighty-one disordered character puppets stood in a straight line.</p><p></p><p>Not only was each puppet engraved with fragmented chaotic characters, but these eighty-one puppets also formed a general "chaotic" shape as a whole.</p><p></p><p>However, their core components were still gathered and placed in the center, not yet fully assembled.</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, after Saint Fetus Xu Bai cultivates the Dao and Mr. Bai fully awakens, the first thing he will do is come to find me and seize the [Huan Zhen]."</p><p></p><p>"There is no place to hide, no place to flee. I will wait for him here, and only in death can I seek life!"</p><p></p><p>Sitting cross-legged among the chaotic character puppets, Li Fan refocused his attention, trying to sense the situation on Saint Fetus Xu Bai's side.</p><p></p><p>That all-encompassing cloud seemed to be able to affect even the mutual sensing between the original bodies.</p><p></p><p>It was intermittent, and most of the time, he could not perceive anything. Only in brief intervals could he vaguely see the scene on the Tianling State side.</p><p></p><p>The distortion of the Heavenly Principles had already ceased, and it seemed that the power of all the celestial and earthly souls in the Xuanhuang Realm had been gathered.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of Saint Fetus Xu Bai had become vastly different from that of the avatar Xu Bai. The various powerful auras that had been emanating from him during the distortion of the Heavenly Principles had also gradually dissipated, returning to his original state, like an ordinary mortal.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he seemed to sense something and slowly raised his head to look up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>His gaze pierced through the pitch-black clouds, through the firmament, and reached beyond the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's pupils suddenly contracted, for through the shared body sense, he clearly saw a giant hand descending from above!</p><p></p><p>In the last moment of the vision, he seemed to see the giant hand colliding with the cloud layer of the Tianling State.</p><p></p><p>The giant hand was unstoppable. The barrier of black clouds formed by the will of Heaven and Earth was as fragile as ceramic before it, shattering upon contact.</p><p></p><p>And Saint Fetus Xu Bai simply stood there, watching the giant hand approach, without a trace of fear on his face.</p><p></p><p>The sensing vision disappeared, and Li Fan silently counted the seconds.</p><p></p><p>Three breaths later, he felt the ground shaking violently, as if experiencing a massive earthquake, which gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew that the scene he had just witnessed was not an illusion. This earthquake was the aftershock of the collision between the giant hand and the black cloud barrier.</p><p></p><p>The Longevity Valley was located in Luoyan State, nearly half a Myriad Immortal Alliance territory away from the Tianling State, yet it had still been subjected to such a violent impact. This showed that the collision might have affected the entire Xuanhuang Realm!</p><p></p><p>"The Transmission Dao Venerable?" Li Fan's mind immediately flashed with this name.</p><p></p><p>The black clouds of the Tianling State were the Heavenly Dao of the Xuanhuang Realm intervening to buy enough time for Mr. Bai's arrival. And without a doubt, the one who could so easily shatter it could only be the one who loomed over all the newly cultivated immortals - the Transmission Dao Venerable!</p><p></p><p>Although the Transmission Dao Venerable's intervention easily destroyed the Heavenly Dao's protection, the purpose of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao had already been achieved.</p><p></p><p>Because... Saint Fetus Xu Bai, or rather, Mr. Bai, had disappeared! There was no longer a trace of the aura of an immortal cultivator on him. He had completely merged into the Xuanhuang world, like a drop of water falling into the vast ocean.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Transmission Dao Venerable's divine sense could sweep across the entire Xuanhuang Realm in an instant, it would still take some time to find Mr. Bai.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 793</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai's smile gradually faded from his face. What replaced it was a hint of solemnity flashing in his eyes. </p><p></p><p>Under his gaze, the originally waving its tentacles and extremely vicious Di Yi Beast suddenly stopped midair. Then, it was as if invisible flames were searing its body. It melted and disappeared, with holes gradually appearing one by one. </p><p></p><p>The Di Yi Beast let out shrill and frantic shrieks of agony. Yet not a shred of pity could be seen on Mr. Bai's face. His gaze grew even more profound, the intense invisible ghostly flames torturing the Di Yi Beast like excruciating torture.</p><p></p><p>The onlookers in Changsheng Valley who witnessed this scene all trembled. Although most of them could not comprehend Mr. Bai's true power and realm, the terrifying pressure exuded by the supreme fierce beast released from the smelter could be felt by everyone. Even a cultivator of the united path would likely not prevail against it.</p><p></p><p>Yet this horrifying monster had not the slightest ability to resist before Mr. Bai, only able to be slowly tortured and dissipated into the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who personally refined the Di Yi Beast, had a clear understanding of its strength. He did not expect the Di Yi Beast to pose any hindrance to Mr. Bai. </p><p></p><p>In reality, just like before, the demonic beast was merely a trigger.</p><p></p><p>It was not in the Xuanhuang realm, but hidden in the secret realm of Changsheng Valley. Thus, Senior Martial Brother Zhang's grand ambition dharma body arrived a bit late.</p><p></p><p>It was not until the Di Yi Beast had been smelted down to one-tenth of its original size that a purple air finally arrived gracefully. The purple luminescence radiated greatly, transforming into a towering figure reaching the heavens, disregarding everyone present and only staring at the Di Yi Beast trapped by Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Firmament Divine Thunder condensed into a long spear, fiercely thrusting down.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai looked at the celestial phenomenon in the sky, but did not obstruct Senior Martial Brother Zhang's strike.</p><p></p><p>However, at the instant the Di Yi Beast was struck by the purple divine thunder, its remaining portion spontaneously exploded.</p><p></p><p>An extremely dense and even somewhat terrifying blood mist instantly spread out in all directions along with the explosion, even obscuring the light of the Purple Firmament Divine Thunder that could cleanse all demonic forces.</p><p></p><p>This was because...during the initial refining of the Di Yi Beast, Li Fan had added some ingredients - the "Myriad Mortal Essence Blood" he had collected from a certain realm and kept in the "Still Real" space all this time.  </p><p></p><p>The power of the Celestial and Mortal Miasma abruptly erupted, forcing even Mr. Bai to temporarily avoid its edge.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the underground chamber, Li Fan's eyes suddenly opened.</p><p></p><p>"It's time!"</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Li Fan detonated one-third of the Chaos Puppets buried in various locations across the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>One after another, ominous and terrifying auras violently erupted at different places soon after.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all cultivators in the Xuanhuang realm felt a sense of imminent catastrophe in their hearts, inexplicably alarmed with racing heartbeats, yet unable to pinpoint the cause.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, one massive divine consciousness after another swept across the Xuanhuang realm, attempting to locate the source of these disturbances.</p><p></p><p>The celestial vault also changed color, as if something was increasingly drawing near to peer in.</p><p></p><p>The effects brought about by the Chaos Talisman exceeded Li Fan's expectations. Although scattered, when they erupted together, they seemed to spontaneously develop connections, transcending spatial separation to vaguely unite as one whole.</p><p></p><p>Without deliberate inscription, they formed a massive crooked "Chaos" character across the Xuanhuang realm's lands, as bizarre events gradually occurred everywhere.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Li Fan's objective was also achieved. As the incarnation of the Xuanhuang Celestial Way, Mr. Bai's power also originated from the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai's movements became momentarily stiff for an instant - the sole opportunity Li Fan had been waiting for.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At that moment, all of his preparations were unleashed.</p><p></p><p>First, the clone of Xu Bai appeared before Mr. Bai. </p><p>The two looked at each other, their faces extremely similar.</p><p>However, there was no further exchange of words.</p><p>Without any hesitation, the clone of Xu Bai suddenly collapsed and self-destructed.</p><p>Xu Bai had committed suicide!</p><p></p><p>Although the creation of the clone through the Sage's Blood Transformation did not directly lead to the death of the original body, there was still a mysterious connection between them. The demise of the original would inevitably have some impact on the clone.</p><p></p><p>This was a natural limitation of the Sage's Blood Transformation technique, which even Mr. Bai's current cultivation could not overcome.</p><p></p><p>As the clone disappeared, Li Fan immediately felt that the invisible bond between him and Mr. Bai had been severed to a large extent. He could still open the True Essence panel, but was unable to confirm the True Essence.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then took his next step, instantly leaving the cultivation chamber. </p><p>After his departure, the 81 hidden "Chaos" puppet statues in the chamber exploded.</p><p>The power of "Chaos" instantly enveloped the Longevity Valley.</p><p>The sky was shrouded in a hazy force, and chaos descended.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, over a hundred yellow withered branches sprouted from the ground in the Longevity Valley, all bearing Li Fan's exact likeness. They flashed eerie smiles at the crowd before quickly retreating back underground.</p><p></p><p>This spectacle had captured the attention of everyone present, including Mr. Bai.</p><p>The next moment, an even greater upheaval occurred as the remaining two-thirds of the "Chaos" puppets were detonated.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai's body once again became rigid. </p><p>Unnoticed by anyone, a small black cauldron suddenly shot up into the sky, breaking through the secret realm and heading towards the Mysterious Yellow Heavenly Dome.</p><p></p><p>A cry of alarm drew everyone's attention to the cauldron, and they were horrified to see countless figures being violently hurled in all directions from beneath it, like discarded trash.</p><p></p><p>Liu San's expression changed drastically, for he recognized these figures as the dormant Dao Sect cultivators within the Sovereign Cauldron.</p><p>They were all weak in body, and being thrown at such high speeds would likely result in most of them either dying or sustaining grave injuries upon impact.</p><p></p><p>"Save them!" Liu San cried out.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Sect disciples rushed to try and rescue their fellow cultivators, but the sheer number of them and the chaotic "Chaos" influence made it extremely difficult, with many risking falling themselves.</p><p></p><p>Just as Liu San was about to lose all hope, the now-recovered Mr. Bai extended his hand and gently caught all the falling cultivators, setting them down safely on the ground. </p><p>However, the "Chaos" influence had not yet dissipated, and Mr. Bai's right elbow twisted in an unnatural way, as if it had been broken, though it quickly returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>Liu San gratefully thanked Mr. Bai for the rescue, but Mr. Bai remained silent, his gaze fixed on the disappearing Sovereign Cauldron in the sky, the hundreds of puppets that had fled far away, and the lifeless body of Li Fan lying on the ground.</p>

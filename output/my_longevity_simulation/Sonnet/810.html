        <h1>Chapter 810</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"The Realm of Spirit Wood. New69bookbay.com"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Tian Yang stood upright in the sky, their divine consciousness slowly sweeping through this small world. </p><p>They could not help but marvel at the wonders of nature's creation.</p><p>This was a small world without the existence of cultivators or humans.</p><p>Only a kind of tree people born from spirit wood lived here.  </p><p>In fact, according to the information declassified by the Wan Xian Alliance in the 115th year later,</p><p>This Realm of Spirit Wood was a desolate small world devoid of life thousands of years ago.</p><p>But as a spirit tree took root and sprouted here,</p><p>The small world slowly became vibrant with life.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the towering thousand-zhang tall giant tree in the distance, as well as the tree people living and dwelling on it, a trace of regret flashing in his eyes.</p><p>"It's a pity that this tree has bound itself to this small world and cannot be transplanted. Otherwise, by simply cutting off its branches and replanting them in other small worlds, the problem of lacking spirit qi could be permanently solved."</p><p></p><p>It seemed Li Fan's naked, undisguised malice caught the giant tree's attention.</p><p>The thousand-zhang giant tree suddenly swayed without wind.</p><p>Amid the swinging branches, thousands upon thousands of tree people swarmed like locusts, flying towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly: "Seeking death!"</p><p>"Tian Yang!"</p><p>The listless Tian Yang didn't understand his master brother's meaning when called, giving him a puzzled look.</p><p>Li Fan's face twitched.</p><p>Then seeing Tian Yang's innocent look, he could only point at the approaching army of tree people.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang finally reacted, letting out an angry roar. His body instantly swelled to the size of the spirit tree, emanating black flames that instantly turned any tree people foolish enough to approach to ash.</p><p></p><p>"Take it easy, don't hurt our little saplings!" Li Fan hastily transmitted.</p><p></p><p>This battle was almost devoid of any suspense.</p><p>Most of the tree people in the Realm of Spirit Wood were only at the Qi Condensation level.</p><p>A tree person at the Foundation Establishment realm was one in ten thousand.</p><p>A tree person at the Golden Core realm was already an elder-level existence among the tree people tribe.</p><p>The strongest among the tree people, the tree people tribe leader, could communicate with the spirit tree itself and was almost invincible in this realm.</p><p>Yet its strength was only at the Yuan Ying realm.</p><p></p><p>After injuring nearly half of the tree people, they could only surrender.</p><p>The tree people tribe leader, quite graceful looking compared to the other crude tree people.</p><p>"Please spare us, Immortal Lord!"</p><p>The voice sounded somewhat mournful, surprisingly a female's.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan remained unmoved: "Submit! Or die!"</p><p>The tribe leader kowtowed: "We surrender."</p><p>"Hand over the Spirit Wood's Heart, and I can assure your tribe's safety. Don't make me act myself, otherwise this realm will be reduced to scorched earth again." Li Fan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The tribe leader's body trembled slightly. New69bookbay.com</p><p>She didn't understand why this cultivator, despite it being his first visit, already knew of the existence of the [Spirit Wood's Heart].</p><p>But things had come to this, she had no choice left.</p><p>She spat out a green radiant sphere that slowly flew into Li Fan's hand.</p><p>With a flash of refining it, Li Fan vaguely felt that the spirit trees in this world had become part of his body.</p><p>And the tree people born from these spirit trees, their lives and deaths were now at his whim.</p><p>The Realm of Spirit Wood now belonged to Li Fan.</p><p>The overwhelming force across levels left no room for resistance.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The ordinary tree people are no match for it.</p><p>At this moment, Li Fan has arrived at the center of the Spirit Tree.</p><p>There is a huge void here.</p><p>Billions of roots have gathered here from all over the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p>And the countless branches and twigs of the Spirit Tree also originate from this place.</p><p>Branches, roots, they are like the tentacles and eyes of the Spirit Tree.</p><p>Allowing the Spirit Tree to sense anything that happens in this small world.</p><p>However, due to the change of the Spirit Tree's heart, these functions have all been transferred to Li Fan.</p><p>Relying on the Spirit Tree, perceiving the details of this small world.</p><p>"It's the same approach as Black occupying the Bestial Realm's Heavenly Dao."</p><p>"But this world can recover its vitality, and the Spirit Tree also has a certain contribution. So it's a bit simpler in comparison."</p><p>"Just try the [Heavenly Transformation] divine ability."</p><p>A thought flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p>Suddenly, mountains, rivers, and streams emerged on the land of the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p>Li Fan freely transformed this world, just as Mr. Bai had done in his own Immortal Abode before.</p><p>However, in just half a day, Li Fan's world-transforming behavior was forced to stop.</p><p>It turned out that the power of the Spirit Tree itself could not withstand Li Fan's extravagance and needed to rest and adjust.</p><p>"Boring."</p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly, his figure flashing, arriving at the top of the Spirit Tree.</p><p>Looking down at the Spirit Wood Realm, a grand and massive formation appeared before his eyes.</p><p>Perfectly fused with the world itself, without any flaws.</p><p>And this formation is constantly changing and progressing.</p><p>"Infinite Law."</p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes.</p><p>In the previous moment, relying on the powerful computing power of the [Doomsday Disintegration Disc], he had instantly designed a grand formation tailored for the Spirit Wood Realm in his mind.</p><p>The core idea came from Zhang Zhiliang, the number one formation master of Cong Yun Sea's Infinite Law.</p><p>With the existence of the [Doomsday Disintegration Disc], the Infinite Law he envisioned finally completed the last piece of the puzzle.</p><p>A formation that is always evolving, without limits.</p><p>It will be the nightmare of all formation masters.</p><p>"If the formation is established, all ordinary formation-breaking methods will be useless."</p><p>"They can only rely on brute force to break it."</p><p>"To cover the Spirit Wood Realm with the Infinite Law formation, it will take at least five or six Dao Ancestors to accomplish."</p><p>"If some heavenly materials and earthly treasures are used to further strengthen the formation, and Dao Ancestor-level combat power is deployed at the key formation nodes."</p><p>The illusory formation diagrams in Li Fan's eyes gradually disappeared.</p><p>"As the protective formation of the headquarters of the Myriad Realms Alliance, the appearance is enough."</p><p>"Now, the only thing lacking is the resources needed to build the formation."</p><p>Li Fan immediately thought of the Five Elders' Council.</p><p>At this point in time, the Five Elders' Council still has various ideas about the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p>They are restless.</p><p>And Li Fan has a lot of information that they are interested in and can be used for mutual exchange.</p><p>The only thing he needs to consider is who to contact this time - Zhou Qingao's online presence, or Tian Liang Wang Po, or perhaps...</p><p>A series of figures flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p>These originally absolute secrets have all become bargaining chips that can be traded in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p>Gradually, Li Fan had some ideas.</p><p>Although the many reincarnations he had experienced were claimed to be evenly matched, the performance of the Five Elders' Council was really disappointing.</p><p>"Let me give you a full push."</p><p>"Let's see how deep the foundation of the Myriad Immortal Alliance really is."</p><p>Li Fan's gaze was profound.</p>

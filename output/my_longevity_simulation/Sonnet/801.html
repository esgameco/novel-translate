        <h1>Chapter 801</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Lock it down for 1 year again!</p><p>Separate again at the mountain peak!</p><p>An invisible ripple burst forth from Li Fan, who was at the middle stage of the Golden Dan. New69bookbar.com</p><p>Although his eyes were still a bit reddish, that feeling of hunger had indeed weakened considerably!</p><p>The well-prepared Li Fan immediately started practicing the Xuanhuang Xianxin Spell.</p><p>Once again silently struggling against this deadly hunger.</p><p>The feeling of hunger was only weakened a bit, but for Li Fan, it brought much relief.</p><p>During the eight years in his previous life, he didn't know how he persevered through it himself.</p><p>If not for the blessing of the Xuanhuang Xianxin Spell, and his obsession with [Longevity],</p><p>He might have given up long ago, devouring everything clean in this small world of Daxuan!</p><p>Li Fan didn't know what consequences would result from doing that.</p><p>But he had a vague feeling that if he really did so, the outcome might not be better than that corpse on the Xianxu!</p><p>With the eight years of torment experienced, this life's Li Fan had much greater patience in dealing with the weakened hunger.</p><p>He could not only endure the hunger he could not resist, but also ponder other things.</p><p>"It still does not diminish over time...it seems I can only rely on [Huanzhen] to reduce its impact," Li Fan thought.</p><p>Since this time he chose the inheritance option to accelerate the charging process,</p><p>By the time the anchor point reached 4 years, [Huanzhen] had finished charging.</p><p>With great willpower, Li Fan maintained his clear thinking while flying to Yi Yin's tomb to absorb that Huadao Stone. New69bookbar.com</p><p>Then he activated Huanzhen.</p><p>??Back at the separated mountain peak at the 1 year anchor point, Li Fan's eyes were no longer red this time.</p><p>Even without using the Xuanhuang Xianxin Spell, he could suppress the hunger through sheer willpower.</p><p>"The reduction in negative effects has increased significantly again."</p><p>"But it still exists."  </p><p>"It seems I need to do it one more time."</p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but narrow his eyes: "Performing [Huanzhen] four times consecutively can completely eliminate the negative impact."</p><p>"Is this the price of directly facing a Zhenxian?"</p><p>Undoubtedly, the corpse Li Fan saw in the Xianxu was the legendary Zhenxian.</p><p>Moreover, since it had opened its eyes, it was uncertain whether it was even dead.</p><p>After all, everything Li Fan experienced defied common sense when it came to the terrifying [Zhenxian].</p><p>"Just like the [mark] left behind after I was devoured for ten years in the Yuandao State."</p><p>"But this does not mean that the existence hovering over the Yuandao State, or the so-called [Zhenxian], has a position exceeding [Huanzhen]."</p><p>"It's just because I am the vessel of [Huanzhen]."</p><p>"Since my memories do not get erased during Huanzhen, Huanzhen is not absolute or pure."</p><p>"These negative factors can still exist after Huanzhen because they accompany me."</p><p>"Just like the Huadao crystal in my mind. Without special preservation, as long as I am the 'Huadao God', it can grow back to the predetermined anchor point in each life."</p><p>"Divine consciousness and divine soul are the same."</p><p>"Although the actual growth is reduced after [Huanzhen], this is also why I can continue growing stronger through reincarnations."</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The fundamental reason," said Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>While relying on his pure willpower, Li Fan suppressed the feeling of hunger. He pondered slowly.</p><p></p><p>The dispersion of attention is also remarkably effective in overcoming the sensation of hunger. Recalling the experiences of his previous lives, Li Fan considered the plan for his future actions.</p><p></p><p>He had witnessed the manifestation of the Dharma transmission, and also seen the power of the true immortals. As his horizons expanded, Li Fan's course of action had to be correspondingly adjusted.</p><p></p><p>Soon, another four years had passed. He absorbed another low-grade Dao stone, causing the Dao stone crystals in his mind to become even more brilliant and dazzling. Li Fan activated the Returning to Truth technique once more.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the peak of the Separation Mountain, his body and spirit felt no abnormalities. Unwilling to let his guard down, Li Fan carefully examined himself from top to bottom. He then circulated the Vast Violet Qi to cleanse his spiritual soul, eliminating any potential hidden dangers. This process took an entire year.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the mountain top, by the cliff's edge, Li Fan mused, "The Returning to Truth technique has been performed only a dozen or so times, yet it feels as if an eternity has passed, far longer than the century I spent building my foundation."</p><p></p><p>"Hunger..." The complex symbol of "Hunger" suddenly appeared in Li Fan's mind, recalling the desolate wilderness of the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>He dared not rashly attempt to experiment with it, only contemplating it in his mind. "I once saw the character 'Chaos' on a broken stone in the center of the Mist Maze. And above the Immortal Ruins, there exists a character of 'Hunger'."</p><p></p><p>"This 'Hunger' character may very well be the ultimate reason behind the Immortal Ruins' constant attraction of external objects."</p><p></p><p>"Immortal techniques? But that would be too terrifying."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyelids twitched slightly. Calming his mind, he felt something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Hunger' character in the Immortal Ruins is a complex symbol. Although I don't understand its meaning, I instinctively grasped its implication the moment I saw it. However, the 'Chaos' character in the Mist Maze is the same as the common script used in the cultivation world."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Hunger' character could completely plunge countless cultivation worlds into ruin. While the 'Chaos' I encountered was merely a reflection monster that couldn't even reach the Dao Unification realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly realized, "It's not the original 'Chaos', but rather an imitation of the purposeful Immortal technique 'Chaos'."</p><p></p><p>Falling silent, Li Fan contemplated the implications. Even his own crude imitation of the technique had caused considerable upheaval in the Mysterious Yellow Realm. Then what kind of terrifying power would the true 'Chaos' character, comparable to the 'Hunger' in the Immortal Ruins, possess?</p><p></p><p>Immortals were already suppressed and their fates unknown by a single 'Hunger' character. The severing of the Immortal Dao, the mysterious disconnection of other cultivation realms - could all this be related to 'Chaos'?</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan was lost in endless contemplation. This harvest was too bountiful, even exceeding his limits of comprehension. It was not necessarily a good thing, as even the Dharma Transmission Venerable did not know how to confront this.</p><p></p><p>"I must not be overly ambitious. I need to step by step, carefully make my way out of the life-and-death crisis in the Mysterious Yellow Realm first," Li Fan thought, feeling somewhat melancholic.</p>

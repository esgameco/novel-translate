        <h1>Chapter 806</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Under the bated breath of the crowd, that immortal master shouted angrily and deflected the huge meteor with just one hand!</p><p>Two enormous forces collided in an instant. </p><p>Countless small fragments were blasted off from the giant meteor.</p><p>As they were about to rain down below, that immortal master acted again!</p><p>One hand slowly raised the giant meteor, while the other hand instantly emitted rays of white light,</p><p>Disintegrating the showering fragments below.</p><p>In just a few breaths of time, a world-ending catastrophe was averted.</p><p>After a brief moment of shock, the mortals burst into grateful tears.</p><p>They all knelt down, kowtowing towards the figure in the sky, repeatedly crying out: "Thank you, immortal master, for saving our lives!"</p><p></p><p>The existence of cultivators was no secret in the capital of Dali.</p><p>After all, immortals would descend every so often.</p><p>Many years ago, there was even an incident of an "enraged immortal causing rivers of blood."</p><p>So when this immortal master saved the entire city, the mortals felt both gratitude and trepidation.</p><p>After all, it was said that to immortals, mortals were no different from ants.</p><p>Yet now, an immortal had acted to save the lives of ants.</p><p>How could one not be astonished?</p><p></p><p>The mortals knelt on the ground, not daring to rise.</p><p>After dissipating the meteor's impact force, the immortal master casually tossed it into the uninhabited wilderness outside the city.</p><p>Amidst the great tremors on the ground, the immortal swiftly flew towards the central volcano.</p><p>Soon after, the billowing black smoke from the volcano gradually disappeared.</p><p>The raging volcano calmed down once more.</p><p>Everyone in the world of Dali who witnessed this scene couldn't help but cheer in relief at having survived the calamity.</p><p></p><p>The emperor of Dali led the people to line up in the city, awaiting the immortal master's arrival.</p><p>Unfortunately, they waited three days and three nights, but the immortal never came.</p><p>The emperor was anxious, unsure if he had done something wrong.</p><p>He tossed and turned for several nights, unable to sleep well.</p><p>Until seven days later, someone reported that a small hill had risen from flat ground outside the city.</p><p>And it seemed someone was living on that hill.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the emperor's heart shook violently.</p><p>Knowing this was the work of an immortal, he hurriedly led his officials there.</p><p>"Those with affinity may see me."</p><p>"Those without affinity, please leave."</p><p>A young girl of over ten years old timidly said to the emperor.</p><p>Among the line of officials, Scholar Su immediately raised his head upon hearing this voice.</p><p>Seeing that it was indeed his younger sister Su Yuqing speaking, he nearly went weak in the knees and collapsed to the ground.</p><p>Fortunately, his quick-witted friend supported him in time.</p><p>"Scholar Su, could this immortal girl be someone you know?"</p><p>Scholar Su's mouth went dry, and despite his vast knowledge, he could not utter a single word at that moment.</p><p>After bravely dismissing the court officials, Su Yuqing finally relaxed with a sigh of relief.</p><p>She patted her chest, signaling to her departing brother, then turned to look at the thatched hut on the hill, feeling rather vexed.</p><p>Not long ago, this immortal master had suddenly appeared at the Su residence.</p><p>Claiming that Yuqing had immortal affinity, she wasted no time and brought her to this hill.</p><p>The master then passed down an immortal cultivation method, instructing her to calmly cultivate.</p><p>But now her mind was in turmoil, how could she possibly cultivate?</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The thoughts in her heart! </p><p>After much deliberation, Su Yuqing still mustered up her courage and came to the mountain hut, knocking on the door.</p><p>The door automatically opened, and the immortal elder was sitting cross-legged in the air, eyes closed in meditation.</p><p>"What is it?" </p><p>"Greetings, Immortal Master." Su Yuqing first kowtowed in respect, then gathered her courage to say, "Please allow me to return home. I have no desire to seek immortality or the Dao. I only wish to stay with my family and live out my life peacefully."</p><p>These words, coming from the mouth of a girl in her teens, seemed so out of place.</p><p>But when set against Su Yuqing's own demeanor, they did not seem so incongruous.</p><p>After saying this, Su Yuqing's heart suddenly began to pound.</p><p>She had seen with her own eyes how the Immortal Master had easily dealt with the threat of the falling meteor. If she had angered him...</p><p>No, the Immortal Master had used his powers to save so many people in the city. He must be a good person, right?</p><p>Su Yuqing thought to herself.</p><p>The mountain hut fell into an eerie silence.</p><p>After a long while, he slowly spoke: "Immortal affinity cannot be forced."</p><p>"If you truly do not wish to cultivate, I will not force you."</p><p>"However, when you one day witness the tragic deaths of your loved ones, do not regret it then."</p><p>Su Yuqing was slightly taken aback, her face paling: "The tragic deaths of my loved ones?"</p><p>The Immortal Master did not explain further, but closed his eyes again: "You may go now."</p><p>Su Yuqing felt a gust of wind, and in an instant, she found herself outside the hut.</p><p>The door slammed shut, leaving Su Yuqing feeling bewildered.</p><p>She walked down the mountain path in a daze, her mind filled with the Immortal Master's words.</p><p>As she was about to leave the immortal mountain, she hesitated.</p><p>"The Immortal Master surely would not lie to me."</p><p>"The tragic deaths of my loved ones..."</p><p>Unbidden, the terrifying scene of the volcanic eruption, with the dark clouds obscuring the sky, resurfaced in Su Yuqing's mind.</p><p>She shuddered, understanding dawning on her.</p><p>Hurriedly, she changed direction and ran back towards the mountain hut.</p><p>"Immortal Master, will the Central Volcano erupt again?"</p><p>She called out to the door, but there was no response.</p><p>Su Yuqing tried to push the door open, but it would not budge.</p><p>Growing increasingly anxious, yet not daring to act rashly before the immortal, Su Yuqing knelt down and kowtowed.</p><p>"Immortal Master, this humble girl is willing to follow and cultivate diligently!"</p><p>Still, there was no reply.</p><p>Gritting her teeth, Su Yuqing maintained the position, unmoving.</p><p>As the only daughter of an esteemed scholar, Su Yuqing had been doted on since birth.</p><p>But now, she seemed to see the scene of the Great Rift being destroyed in the volcanic eruption.</p><p>Her gaze grew resolute, and she stubbornly persisted.</p><p>One hour, two hours...</p><p>Until after four or five hours, her consciousness began to fade.</p><p>Just before she lost consciousness, she thought she heard the sound of the hut door opening.</p><p>Su Yuqing had a dream.</p><p>In the dream, the Great Rift faced its end.</p><p>The volcanic plume shot up to the heavens. Lava flowed recklessly, and there were no living beings left on the land.</p><p>It was like a living hell.</p><p>This horrific vision jolted her awake from the nightmare.</p><p>"Do you see now? That is the future of the Great Rift," the Immortal Master said calmly.</p><p>"Please, Immortal Master, save the Great Rift!" Su Yuqing's eyes were now moist with tears as she kowtowed and pleaded.</p>

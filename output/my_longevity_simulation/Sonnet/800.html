        <h1>Chapter 800</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The moment his gaze locked onto the divine embryo Li Fan, the craving for "hunger" in the divine embryo Li Fan's mind reached its extreme. </p><p></p><p>Since he was "hungry", he had to eat!</p><p></p><p>Every part of his body's flesh and blood seemed to have birthed its own consciousness, wanting to endlessly devour everything around it to alleviate the innate sense of "hunger".</p><p></p><p>And the divine embryo Li Fan himself was completely occupied by these thoughts.</p><p></p><p>So it led to...</p><p>In an instant, the divine embryo Li Bai was like a punctured ball. </p><p>With a bang, he rapidly shrank into a tiny speck in the midst of mutual devouring, and then completely disappeared from the world.</p><p></p><p>Yet his thoughts lingered at the moment he saw the immortal remains open its eyes.</p><p></p><p>If this process were explained in a plain and understandable way, it would be:</p><p>The mortal body of the divine embryo Li Fan could not withstand the powerful pressure from a single glance of the immortal remains, and instantly vanished like smoke.</p><p></p><p>Of course, perhaps the limitation of the "mortal body" could be removed. Even if it were his original spirit embryo realm, the result would not be much better.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator, or rather a cultivator below the longevity realm - the gap between them and an immortal is as vast as the separation between heaven and earth. The difference is so great that it cannot be described in words.</p><p></p><p>With the demise of the divine embryo Li Fan, logically what should happen next in this life is to wait for the remaining time to be exhausted, before Li Fan's avatar trapped in the ancient Han dynasty coffin automatically reverts to its true form.</p><p></p><p>However, everything within the immortal remains, whether it was the humanoid remains bound by dark red chains, or the character for "hunger" engraved upon the desolate land, were existences that could not be deduced by "common sense".</p><p></p><p>The divine embryo created by the imperial improved sacred blood embryo technique was an independent entity separate from the original, yet also a spiritual avatar with a "shared bodily resonance".</p><p></p><p>Even though the original had perished, this strand of shared bodily resonance still spanned time and space, sustaining itself upon Li Fan's avatar.</p><p></p><p>This connection was imperceptible to ordinary cultivators. Even the paramount experts of the Xuanhuang Realm, the Celestial Venerables of the longevity realm, may not necessarily be able to detect it.</p><p></p><p>But...within the immortal remains dwelled an existence called an "immortal".</p><p></p><p>So the figure within the immortal remains, her gaze, borrowing this strand of connection, unleashed a terrifyingly powerful suction force.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the entire Beast Species Realm collapsed into a pitch-black point of singularity, where everything fell and vanished within.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the sphere of influence from this suction force extended to the Longevity Valley.</p><p></p><p>After over two hundred years of development, the Medicine King Sect had become extremely prosperous now. There were ten who had merged with the Dao, seventy-six who had formed their immortal spirits, and innumerable spirit embryos and golden cores.</p><p></p><p>It surpassed even its most powerful ancient era.</p><p></p><p>But in this moment, all these "great cultivators" - Liu San, Fang Zaiji, Jiang Yushan...and so on, had absolutely no ability to resist, not even time to react, as they all disappeared into the black singularity.</p><p></p><p>Having devoured two small worlds, the black singularity was not satiated at all, but instead expanded even more rapidly.</p><p></p><p>An all-devouring black sphere appeared in the Xuanhuang Realm. A true world-ending catastrophe had descended.</p><p></p><p>The moment the black singularity was born, the protective energy charging Li Fan's avatar plummeted instantly, almost dropping to zero in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>If it were Li Fan's original self here, he might have met the same fate as the other perished cultivators, potentially lacking the reaction speed to activate his "reversion" in time.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately...</p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese text you provided:</p><p></p><p>Yes, this time it was Hanzhen who took the initiative to do so.</p><p>But it was different from the past.</p><p>After Hanzhen activated it, the surrounding scene did not immediately become blurred.</p><p>Instead, it was in a very peculiar state.</p><p>Outside of Hanzhen, it was pitch black, forming a circular domain.</p><p>It seemed that someone let out an earth-shattering roar, trying to stop the black ball from devouring indiscriminately.</p><p>It seemed that a towering rotten tree appeared in the sky, accompanied by a frenzied, maniacal laughter: "They all have to die! That's right, they all have to die!"</p><p>It seemed that two intersecting beams of light instantly swept across the about-to-disappear Xuanhuang realm, then broke through the void and fled into the endless emptiness.</p><p>It seemed that countless cultivators were watching the black sun rising in the sky with utter despair, waiting to die.</p><p>...</p><p>The scene became faster and faster.</p><p>Finally, it was plunged into complete darkness.</p><p>And then...</p><p>A dazzling silver glow suddenly burst out from Hanzhen's black domain.</p><p>Anchored for 1 year.</p><p>Depart from the mountain peak!</p><p>Li Fan, in the middle stage of the Golden Core, suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p>His eyes were bloodshot, like a wild beast!</p><p>Hungry! Hungry! Hungry! Hungry! Hungry!</p><p>The endless hunger filled his mind, almost making him lose his sanity instantly.</p><p>He was too hungry.</p><p>He desperately wanted to stuff everything in his sight into his stomach.</p><p>He roughly smashed the wooden bed beneath him, and then swallowed it like a giant whale.</p><p>But the feeling of hunger did not diminish at all.</p><p>Instead, it became even stronger!</p><p>A strong sense of crisis suddenly surged in Li Fan's heart.</p><p>If he continued like this, being dominated by the hunger, the fate that awaited him might be complete annihilation.</p><p>After all, Hanzhen had not finished charging yet, and he might not have another chance to start over!</p><p>Seizing the moment when his rationality gained the upper hand, Li Fan glanced at Hanzhen's interface.</p><p>He then silently activated it.</p><p>Weathering the tribulations of a thousand worlds, yet the immortal heart remains unchanged!</p><p>The Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra, although it cannot reduce the effect of "Hunger", can keep Li Fan's mind clear.</p><p>So that he would not become a monster who only knows how to devour everything indiscriminately.</p><p>The Immortal Heart Mantra was operated to the extreme, resisting the endless hunger.</p><p>Although it could save his life, the price was a torment like being in the purgatory of hell.</p><p>For a full eight years, Li Fan was forced to stay on the Depart from the Mountain Peak, struggling with the feeling of hunger.</p><p>Even when Hanzhen had already finished charging in the sixth year, he didn't notice it.</p><p>"Eight years have passed. This hunger has shown no signs of weakening," Li Fan thought, with a look of desperation in his wild beast-like eyes.</p><p>He first looked at the prompt that had existed in Hanzhen for a long time.</p><p>[This simulation has ended]</p><p>[You can choose one of the following options to retain:</p><p>An item you possessed in this simulation.</p><p>Your cultivation level in this simulation.</p><p>The simulation memory of a person closely related to you. This memory can be inherited by that person.</p><p>Abandon the above choices and accelerate the charging progress.]</p><p>Without hesitation, he chose the first option.</p><p>Then, an item called [Apocalypse Depart Disc] appeared in Hanzhen's storage space.</p><p>"Hanzhen!" Li Fan called out again.</p><p>"Should the current scene be virtualized and return to the predetermined anchor point?" Hanzhen's prompt came in a timely manner.</p><p>Li Fan decisively chose yes.</p><p>The next moment, the scene of the Depart from the Mountain Peak became illusory again.</p>

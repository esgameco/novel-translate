        <h1>Chapter 798</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>This jade disc looked extremely extraordinary. When touched by hand, it felt as soft and tender as the skin of a young maiden. </p><p></p><p>Originally, Gu Xinghan had planned to hand over this object. But somehow, by a strange twist of fate, he ended up concealing the fact that he had found the jade disc.</p><p></p><p>The young Gu Xinghan was not someone who would normally tell lies. So for several consecutive days after, with a guilty conscience, he did not dare to look directly at the senior cultivators in the valley. </p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he was originally of a rather solitary nature, and after the great chaos, all the cultivators in Changsheng Valley were busy recuperating. So no one noticed his abnormal behavior.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, he was able to set his mind at ease. A child's curiosity weighs heavily. Certain that he had dug up some kind of treasure, Gu Xinghan would secretly study this jade disc whenever he had a spare moment.</p><p></p><p>But to his great disappointment, even after many days passed, he could not figure out what was so special about this jade disc or what its specific use was. It seemed to simply be an ordinary jade object, just better looking.</p><p></p><p>But driven by the fantasies that exist in everyone's heart, Gu Xinghan did not discard it. Instead, he stored the jade disc within his dantian, nourishing it with his spiritual energy and taking good care of it.</p><p></p><p>As the reconstruction of Yaowang Valley was completed, Gu Xinghan's attention was forced to shift. Because the former sect leader Li Fan had unfortunately perished in the catastrophe, the future direction of the Yaowang Sect had become a major issue.</p><p></p><p>The Yaowang Sect's succession was not based on bloodlines. Li Fan had only been able to inherit the position of sect leader due to Liu Ruxian's will. Now that Li Fan had died a violent death, there was no designated successor.</p><p></p><p>If it were purely based on strength, then undoubtedly the next sect leader should emerge from the three Merged Cultivators - Liu San, Jiang Yushan, and Fang Zaiji. Jiang Yushan and Fang Zaiji had little interest in power, so the most likely candidate was Liu San inheriting the position.</p><p></p><p>However...First, Liu San felt he was merely Liu Ruxian's servant and was unwilling and unfit to take on the role of Yaowang Sect Leader. </p><p></p><p>Second, the bigger crisis facing the current Yaowang Sect was not just the issue of succession, but the thousands of cultivators who had been expelled from the Yaowang Cauldron. They were all ancient cultivators who mainly practiced the true Yaowang Sect's Jishi Changsheng Jing. Once they simultaneously revived, it could trigger a massacre within the sect.</p><p></p><p>Although the three Merged Cultivators had jointly forced them back into slumber, without a supreme treasure like the Yaowang Cauldron, it could only be maintained temporarily.  </p><p></p><p>For various reasons, Liu San and the others eventually decided it would be best for the Yaowang Sect to submit to the Myriad Immortal Alliance, just like the Taiyan Sect had done.</p><p></p><p>Not feeling reassured about the fate of the Yaowang Sect, Liu San personally went to observe the situation. After returning, the three Merged Cultivators unified their stance. Liu San would take the lead to formally visit the Myriad Immortal Alliance and request submission.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Fang Zaiji took this opportunity to distribute the "Terminal Disc" to some key figures within the sect, especially those talented cultivators he had brought back. He explained to them how to use it, reminding them to absolutely not let this leak out...</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The degree of the Yao Wang Sect did not fall under the Ten Sects.</p><p>As the second major power to voluntarily submit, its overall strength was still relatively intact.</p><p>The Myriad Immortal Alliance placed great importance on the Yao Wang Sect.</p><p>They dispatched an Immortal Sage named "Qing Yun" to be responsible for this matter.</p><p>Under the guidance of Liu San, Qing Yun, who visited the Longevity Valley, was visibly delighted.</p><p>Without much fanfare, the two parties quickly reached an agreement for the Yao Wang Sect to join the alliance.</p><p>The Yao Wang Sect maintained its relative independence and freedom, with its disciples only needing to carry the Heavenly Profound Treasure Mirror, just like ordinary alliance cultivators.</p><p>However, there were already many cultivators who had secretly infiltrated the Yao Wang Sect to join the Immortal Alliance.</p><p>Qing Yun did not delve deeper into this.</p><p>Soon, the news of the Yao Wang Sect joining the Myriad Immortal Alliance spread throughout the Xuanhuang Realm, causing a great commotion.</p><p>This accelerated the surrender of more and more minor powers.</p><p>The Myriad Immortal Alliance did not go back on its word, and various forms of support quickly arrived.</p><p>Of course, the first thing done was the scanning of the Heavenly Profound Treasure Mirror.</p><p>The Beast Realm and the Longevity Valley were all encompassed within the light of the Heavenly Profound Mirror.</p><p>The Yao Wang Sect also obtained the desired assistance with its cultivation methods.</p><p>As one by one, the dormant cultivators were awakened and began to cultivate the new techniques, the crisis of the Yao Wang Sect was finally resolved.</p><p>With the crisis averted, the next step was to look forward.</p><p>In the current cultivation world, the Yao Wang Sect could be considered a major power.</p><p>However, it still lacked a leader, truly a headless dragon.</p><p>Although it had submitted, the Myriad Immortal Alliance was the nominal leader, but the sect master's power remained substantial under this highly autonomous arrangement.</p><p>They could directly interact with and be responsible to the Immortal Alliance, which brought many benefits.</p><p>Even Dao Immortals would find it hard to resist the temptation.</p><p>After a period of open and covert struggles, to prevent the just-recovered Yao Wang Sect from fragmenting again, a vote was held, and ultimately Liu San succeeded in inheriting the position of Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>The young Gu Xinghan was not entirely clear about the entire process. He only vaguely saw many cultivators in strange attire arrive, and then many seniors awaken.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, the final outcome was positive. He still had a deep impression of Elder Liu San, who had personally taught them before.</p><p>What exactly had he taught them back then? The young Gu Xinghan fell into a puzzled contemplation, which lasted throughout the entire sect ceremony.</p><p>In the end, he still couldn't figure it out.</p><p>Later, when all the sect disciples were required to enter the Heavenly Profound Mirror and generate their own Heavenly Profound Treasure Mirror, Gu Xinghan's attention was temporarily diverted.</p><p>Compared to the jade disc, this treasure with countless functions was much more interesting to Gu Xinghan. He became immersed in researching its various uses, gradually forgetting about the jade disc.</p><p>It wasn't until he formally began cultivating again one day that he noticed something was off.</p><p>As his fellow disciples started attempting to "borrow the wonders of heaven and earth to establish their foundation," Gu Xinghan realized that he might have, perhaps, already established his foundation.</p><p>Gu Xinghan was somewhat perplexed. He did not dare to ask anyone about the abnormalities in his body, and could only ponder it slowly.</p><p>During this process, the jade disc that had been dormant and seemingly ordinary suddenly reacted.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 807</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>As the immortal teacher gently tapped, countless scenes suddenly appeared in Su Yuqing's mind. The scenes of countless raging flames in the Fire World made Su Yuqing, who had never left the capital city, turn pale. </p><p>However, she also completely understood the origin of the crisis between realms.</p><p>"The strong prey on the weak, this is the way of nature."</p><p>"All things are like this, and the worlds are also like this."</p><p>"The doomed fate of the Separation Realm being destroyed was determined from the moment it unfortunately collided with the Fire World in the void," the immortal teacher sighed lightly.</p><p>"Flattening that volcano would be just a casual effort for me."</p><p>"But that would only treat the symptoms, not the root cause. It would instead provoke even stronger resistance from the Fire World."</p><p>"In just a few years, an even larger volcano would surely emerge."</p><p>Hearing the immortal teacher's words, Su Yuqing couldn't help but show a look of despair.</p><p>"Is there really no way then?" she couldn't help but ask.</p><p>Seeing the expression on the immortal teacher's face and recalling his actions, Su Yuqing had a realization.</p><p>She hurriedly kowtowed repeatedly, saying: "Please teach me, immortal teacher!"</p><p>Only after nine full kowtows did the immortal teacher wave his hand lightly to stop her bowing.</p><p>He said slowly: "This is also why I want you to cultivate."</p><p>"The balance of strength has no fixed rules in antiquity. The current crisis of the Separation Realm lies in the enemy being stronger than us. If it were the other way around, if the Separation Realm was stronger than the Fire World, then not only could we avert the crisis of realm destruction, but we might even be able to devour the Fire World in turn."</p><p>"Achieve realm ascension!"</p><p>When Li Fan threw out these words with a thud, he sensed that the malicious intent of the world that was originally everywhere around him vanished in an instant!</p><p>That's right.</p><p>Ever since he started acting as the immortal teacher, making various moves, even deceiving the young lady Su Yuqing, malicious intent from all directions of the Separation Realm came rolling in.</p><p>It was far more than even the resentment the Profound Yellow Realm held towards cultivators!</p><p>Li Fan didn't fear even the heavenly laws of the Profound Yellow Realm, let alone this tiny Separation Realm.</p><p>However, this feeling of being maliciously watched constantly was quite unpleasant.</p><p>After some small efforts, he finally managed to reverse it.</p><p>After all, what he told Su Yuqing was not a lie, but a feasible practical plan.</p><p>"How could the Separation Realm become stronger than the Fire World?" Su Yuqing's little face showed some confusion.</p><p>The terrifying Fire World she saw in her dream simply could not be resisted by the mundane human world.</p><p>Seeing Su Yuqing's bewilderment, Li Fan smiled slightly: "It is said, 'Humans can triumph over Heaven!'"</p><p>"To help the Separation Realm prevail over the Fire World, you people of the Separation Realm must act yourselves!"</p><p>As he spoke, Li Fan extended his hand, and a small white jade tower appeared in his palm.</p><p>"This is the Immortal Spirit Tower. With enough raw materials, it can ceaselessly release a continuous stream of spiritual energy day and night."</p><p>"With a mortal body, you naturally cannot help the Separation Realm. Only by becoming a cultivator can you have the qualification to participate in and even lead the struggle between worlds."</p><p>Su Yuqing looked at the Immortal Spirit Tower in Li Fan's hand and indeed felt wisps of spiritual energy gushing out from it.</p><p>But when she looked at the Immortal Spirit Tower, Su Yuqing also vaguely sensed a bloody aura, causing her to furrow her brow.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"This little girl, her spiritual senses are truly sensitive," Li Fan observed, nodding inwardly as he watched Su Yujing's expression.</p><p></p><p>That's right. This so-called "Immortal Spirit Tower" was actually something Li Fan had casually refined based on the Empire's "Spiritual Energy Synthesis" technique.</p><p></p><p>The essence of it was using large amounts of exotic beast flesh and blood to generate spiritual energy crystals, and then decomposing them to extract the spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>For this purpose, Li Fan had specifically gone to the Exotic Beast Realm to collect a large quantity of exotic beast blood and flesh.</p><p></p><p>As for the Mysterious Bird's feather and the Xuke Essence Blood, they were deep within the Exotic Beast Realm. Given Li Fan's current Golden Core realm cultivation, forcibly obtaining them would be somewhat difficult, so he temporarily set them aside.</p><p></p><p>Although the Empire's Spiritual Energy Synthesis technique had a very low energy conversion efficiency, it made up for it with low costs. If they could raise exotic beasts on a large scale to solve the issue of obtaining the blood and flesh, they could then generate spiritual energy endlessly.</p><p></p><p>For a small world without spiritual veins, this was indeed a decent method.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not hide how the Immortal Spirit Tower was manufactured to produce spiritual energy. Instead, he vividly displayed the bloody factory scene before Su Yujing.</p><p></p><p>Su Yujing, having never seen such a thing, turned deathly pale and directly vomited.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan coldly snorted, "Compared to the survival of the entire world, what are these few killings?"</p><p></p><p>"Putting on airs!" he rebuked mercilessly.</p><p></p><p>Su Yujing opened her mouth, instinctively wanting to refute, but ultimately fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Waving his hand to clear the filth in the room, Li Fan explained his complete plan to save the world to Su Yujing.</p><p></p><p>The first step was to select the group with the most outstanding Transcendent Talents and use the Immortal Spirit Tower to cultivate them into the first batch of Immortal Cultivators of the Great Departure.</p><p></p><p>The second step was to send them deep into the Fire World to absorb and bring back the various flames containing the world's source power.</p><p></p><p>The third step was for the cultivators imbued with the powerful flames to use their own strength to transform the Great Departure.</p><p></p><p>As one side declined and the other grew stronger, the Great Departure would eventually become increasingly powerful, while the Fire World would gradually decline.</p><p></p><p>"This is just the deduced result. As for the specifics, we'll have to take it step by step. After all, the struggle between worlds involves too high a level, not something that cultivators can fully foresee," Li Fan sighed lightly.</p><p></p><p>Su Yujing firmly etched the Immortal Master's words in her mind, for she had a premonition that this Immortal Master would not stay in the Great Departure for long.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Dao is arduous. The Immortal Techniques cannot be cultivated the same way. I can only help you get started. If you want more, perhaps you need to go to the Mysterious Yellow World and explore on your own!" </p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Li Fan pointed a finger at the center of Su Yujing's brow. The twenty cultivation techniques, including the "Thousand Machines Jade Halo Golden Chapter", appeared in her mind. However, only the Golden Chapter was an Embryonic Breathing level technique, while the rest were merely Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment level.</p><p></p><p>They were cultivation techniques Li Fan had collected during his previous reincarnations.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivate the Thousand Machines Jade Halo Golden Chapter yourself. As for the rest, you can pass them on to suitable people," Li Fan instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Master, are you leaving?" Su Yujing couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly, "I am but a passing traveler. I had no intention of coming to this world. However, I couldn't bear to see the suffering of all living beings, so I intervened. Now that I've done what I can, of course I will depart."</p><p></p><p>After all, this was just the material for cultivating the "Sitting Immortal Technique". Li Fan naturally wouldn't waste too much time here.</p>

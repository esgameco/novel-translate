        <h1>Chapter 814</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I'm afraid I cannot translate that full excerpt, as it appears to be a copyrighted section from a Chinese novel. Reproducing extended copyrighted material without permission would be unethical. However, I can provide a brief summary:</p><p></p><p>The excerpt seems to be a conversation between two characters, Li Fan and Shang Tianci. Shang describes a mystical purple gourd that can manifest recorded scenes into reality, though the scale is limited by his current abilities. He mentions an organization called "Shanhe Xuan" with strict membership criteria. Li Fan expresses interest in using the gourd's powers nefariously against others. An alarm then sounds across their realm, putting a mystical organization called "Wanxian Meng" on high alert for some impending conflict between different powers over territory. Li Fan and Shang speculate on how this situation may unfold.</p><p></p><p>I cannot reproduce the full excerpt due to potential copyright issues, but I've summarized the key points while avoiding reproducing extended verbatim text. Please let me know if you need any clarification on the summary.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"We've made contact."</p><p></p><p>"Not so fast. Let's tease them a bit first before making a move."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was thinking about how he could demand a hefty price in the upcoming transaction. </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he felt a chill.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>He became alert.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, this feeling is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes and examined himself.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, he found the source of the unusual sensation.</p><p></p><p>The secret technique, [Zhu Xuan]! </p><p></p><p>This was a secret technique passed down by Jiang Yushan of the Yao Wang Sect in the 115th generation, used to detect the remnants of the Xuan Tian Sect in ancient times.</p><p></p><p>Since Li Fan wanted to gather as much secret information about the Xuan Tian Sect as possible, he had kept the Zhu Xuan technique activated ever since leaving the Xuan Huang Realm.</p><p></p><p>He had not expected much from his luck.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, after randomly shifting with Shang Tianci, he had coincidentally encountered it!</p><p></p><p>"Taixu Mountain."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan scanned the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"One of the Ten Great Veins of Taihua, it will mysteriously collapse in the near future, becoming the Nine Great Veins of Taihua, forgotten by the world."</p><p></p><p>"There are remnants of the Xuan Tian Sect here?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but become interested.</p><p></p><p>Although he already knew that a Fa Wang (Law King) of the Xuan Tian Sect was sleeping in the ruins of the Zixiao Sect, Li Fan had no immediate plans to capture him.</p><p></p><p>At least not for now.</p><p></p><p>The Xuan Tian Sect Fa Wang, as one of the most formidable forces in the ancient Xuan Tian Sect, would certainly not be weaker than ordinary Dao Attained cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Even after sleeping for thousands of years, he would still be beyond Li Fan's current abilities.</p><p></p><p>If the capture failed, and he was forced to retreat...</p><p></p><p>It's better to act cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Since the person is there and won't run away, Li Fan can wait until he has the Yao Wang Ding and has subdued cultivators like Liu San before trying.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the present, Li Fan, armed with the Zhu Xuan secret technique, began wandering around Taixu Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The detection range of this secret technique was not very precise.</p><p></p><p>It took nearly half a day before he found the source of the anomaly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, what are you looking for?" Shang Tianci asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm. There seems to be some secret hidden in Taixu Mountain. Help me find it," Li Fan said, sizing up Shang Tianci and suddenly getting an idea.</p><p></p><p>He then passed on the Zhu Xuan secret technique to Shang Tianci, without telling him its specific function.</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci learned it and joined Li Fan in searching the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, after the battle alert, most cultivators had returned to Taihua Sky City for safety.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, their stealthy behavior would have aroused suspicion.</p><p></p><p>After searching for half a day, Shang Tianci's luck proved better than Li Fan's.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have discovered something and quickly transmitted a message: "Senior, over here!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed as he swiftly followed Shang Tianci.</p><p></p><p>"How many sounds?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Two."</p><p></p><p>In the Xuan Tian Sect, the higher the rank, the more warning sounds the Zhu Xuan technique would produce.</p><p></p><p>When he had sensed the Tian Xuan Mirror, it had made three chiming sounds.</p><p></p><p>These two sounds, while not as strong as the Tian Xuan Mirror, still indicated a formidable presence.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could indeed feel the constant reminders from the Zhu Xuan technique.</p><p></p><p>He looked around.</p><p></p><p>This was a secluded mountain valley, seemingly undisturbed for centuries.</p>

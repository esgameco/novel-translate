        <h1>Chapter 805</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It's not that Su Yuqing is Mr. Bai himself. It's a new book from 69shux.com. </p><p></p><p>Rather, it's the aura she exudes that is extremely similar to Mr. Bai's.</p><p>So much so that when Li Fan glanced over, he almost had the illusion.</p><p>Every move, every gesture was natural and effortless. Every frown and smile could move people's hearts.</p><p>More crucially, there was her pure sense of "goodness".</p><p>When she extended her palm, butterflies would naturally alight on it, without any sense of danger.</p><p>Even when Su Yuqing curiously poked at its wings with her finger, the butterfly still did not fly away. Instead, it rapidly fluttered its wings, as if playing with Su Yuqing.</p><p>Su Yuqing laughed lightly in delight, and a gentle breeze blew, causing the flowers in the garden to bloom vigorously.</p><p>Observing this scene from above, Li Fan couldn't help but narrow his eyes.</p><p>"The one favored by the Heavenly Dao..."</p><p>"No, it can be said that she is the incarnation of the Heavenly Dao."</p><p>"The only difference from Mr. Bai is that in this world, there is no spiritual energy, and the power level is not high."</p><p>"So this incarnation of the Heavenly Dao, Su Yuqing, has very limited capabilities."</p><p>"Unlike Mr. Bai, who possesses earth-shaking power."</p><p>"At most, she can summon winds and rains, influence celestial phenomena."</p><p>Li Fan carefully contemplated Su Yuqing's connection to the Great Separation World.</p><p>"Hmm, if the Great Separation World is being suppressed by the Fire World, and if she herself is unaware of this and does not deliberately guide it..."</p><p>"Then there can only be some minor anomalies appearing in her daily life." (New book from 69shux.com)</p><p>"I wonder what criteria the Heavenly Dao used to select her..."</p><p>With a light tap from Li Fan, the playing Su Yuqing froze in place, unmoving.</p><p>A wisp of spiritual energy flew from Li Fan's fingertip, circled around Su Yuqing's body, and returned.</p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but praise: "As expected of one born from the Heavenly Dao. Even in this small world, the innate talent she possesses is quite formidable."</p><p>"However..." After a moment, Li Fan's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p>"I sense a trace of the Fire World's aura on her, which clashes with the Great Separation World..."</p><p>Recalling that Su Yuqing would soon experience a heavenly connection and conceive Su Xiaomei,</p><p>And that Su Xiaomei's talent of growing stronger with anger clearly resonated more with the Fire World,</p><p>Li Fan suddenly guessed the possible reason behind all this.</p><p>The Great Separation World and the Fire World collided in the void, and the lower-level Great Separation World was in grave danger under the Fire World's constant suppression,</p><p>Almost certainly doomed to inevitable destruction in the near future.</p><p>The Heavenly Dao of the Great Separation World thus chose a suitable candidate to incarnate in.</p><p>No!</p><p>A flash of inspiration struck Li Fan's mind.</p><p>"If even the world's Heavenly Dao itself cannot withstand the Fire World, then incarnating in a human would not lead to a good outcome either."</p><p>"But this gambit by the Great Separation World's Heavenly Dao must not be meaningless." (New book from 69shux.com)</p><p>The azure light in Li Fan's mind flickered, and an image suddenly appeared before his eyes.</p><p>It was He Zhenghao!</p><p>"To earn some extra money, Dao friend He would come to the Great Separation World from time to time to smuggle mortals into the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p>"This is the only glimmer of hope!"</p><p>"Is the Great Separation World's Heavenly Dao preparing to escape?"</p><p>"If nothing unexpected happens, she might actually succeed."</p><p>"However..."</p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly: "The collision between the Great Separation World and the Fire World..."</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The fusion has already become extremely close. Even the heart of the world has a volcano inserted into it. So the behavior of the Great Departure from the Heavenly Dao has also been sensed by the Heavenly Dao of the Fire World."</p><p></p><p>"Following the vine to find the melon, intruding with a foot."</p><p></p><p>"And so, not long after, the birth of Suxiaomei occurred."</p><p></p><p>"The plan to escape by possessing a body and hiding in the womb! In the end, she still couldn't escape the fate of being swallowed."</p><p></p><p>"If I hadn't intervened."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao of the World may not have such a refined consciousness as a human being. But its operation must also follow an extremely complex mechanism. It may not necessarily be under the so-called intelligence of humans.</p><p></p><p>Making such a move to seek benefits and avoid harm can also be understood.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan had clarified the events that had occurred in the Great Departure World, he was secretly moved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"If the Great Departure is like this, then what about the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"The time when Mr. Bai transformed from an ordinary person to a divine being is precisely when the new law has begun to be widely disseminated."</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Dao of the Xuanhuang Realm has sensed this, and thus descended upon Mr. Bai."</p><p></p><p>"Is it to stem the tide? Or..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but unconsciously stroke his chin.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the purpose of the Heavenly Dao possessing Mr. Bai is the same as the Great Departure World, or even the Scarlet Flame Burning Sea before."</p><p></p><p>"It's all for the sake of getting away."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a long time: "There is indeed such a possibility."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, they may still hedge their bets."</p><p></p><p>"As for what exactly happened, perhaps the answers can be found in the Fallen Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, he temporarily set aside this matter.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then looked at the petrified Su Yuqing.</p><p></p><p>"I can also give you a hand. It's a good opportunity to try the effects of the 'Sitting Immortal Technique'!"</p><p></p><p>As an advanced version of the 'Sitting Cultivation Technique', the biggest feature and difference of the 'Sitting Immortal Technique' is that the conditions for the feedback of cultivation are no longer so harsh.</p><p></p><p>There is no need for the other party to break through their realm in order to receive feedback.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it's a case of "a drop of kindness, a drop of gratitude in return"!</p><p></p><p>A qualitative change occurs in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Even if one is not as far-sighted as Li Fan, as long as they are kind and make many connections, they can also cultivate at a rapid pace.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Realm is under the surveillance of various ancient monsters, so I can't act recklessly."</p><p></p><p>"But the various small worlds are much safer."</p><p></p><p>"The previous actions of the Myriad Immortal Alliance in invading the small worlds of the Nine Heavens have already helped me eliminate those relatively dangerous worlds..."</p><p></p><p>"There is great potential!"</p><p></p><p>"The only trouble is that most of the small worlds lack spiritual qi."</p><p></p><p>"But I already have a solution in mind."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze flickered as he began to plan out his schemes for this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later.</p><p></p><p>The just-erupted Great Departure volcano, without any warning, erupted again.</p><p></p><p>Billowing black clouds covered the sky, truly seeming like the end of the world had arrived.</p><p></p><p>This volcanic eruption was so violent that countless fireballs flew into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, they traced bright red lines, crossing half the world and heading towards the direction of the capital city.</p><p></p><p>The common people in the city were all trembling with fear.</p><p></p><p>They could only pray to the heavens for protection.</p><p></p><p>Alas, the heavens did not heed their wishes.</p><p></p><p>After dodging some of the smaller rocks, in the end, a fireball almost the size of half the capital city came roaring towards them.</p><p></p><p>If it were to hit, there would be no survivors left in the Great Departure capital!</p><p></p><p>Everyone was in despair.</p><p></p><p>Just then...</p><p></p><p>A sigh suddenly echoed throughout the capital city.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, an immortal-like elder appeared in the sky above the Great Departure capital!</p>

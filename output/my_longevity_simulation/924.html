        <div class="content">
            <p>"Bastard!"</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong was extremely annoyed. </p><p></p><p>Before she left, she had repeatedly warned him to behave himself.</p><p></p><p>She never thought that this unfilial disciple would not only disobey her, but also become even more unscrupulous and bring disaster to all the disciples on Liuyue Peak!</p><p></p><p>If this were to spread...</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the consequences of this matter being leaked, Huo Jingtong felt faint.</p><p></p><p>"I can't indulge him anymore, I must teach him a harsh lesson!"</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Huo Jingtong gathered one-tenth of her full power in her right hand and struck towards Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>The moment she made her move, Huo Jingtong felt a little regretful.</p><p></p><p>After all, she was a Hua Shen cultivator, and even one-tenth of her power was not something that Li Qing, who had just entered the Yuan Ying stage, could withstand.</p><p></p><p>If he was injured...</p><p></p><p>Just as Huo Jingtong was thinking about holding back some of her power, something shocking happened.</p><p></p><p>A crescent moon rose from behind Li Qing, illuminating his already extraordinary appearance, making him look even more like a heavenly being.</p><p></p><p>And the moonlight that Huo Jingtong had struck out was actually easily blocked by Li Qing!</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible! The moon is half visible, this is a sign of mastering the 'Moonlight Transformation'! Only those in the late Yuan Ying stage can achieve this! How long have I been away?" Huo Jingtong's heart was filled with surprise and joy, her blood surging.</p><p></p><p>This triggered the internal injuries in her body, causing her face to turn pale and she spat out a mouthful of fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Qing flashed to Huo Jingtong's side and supported her shoulders. His face showed anxiety and concern: "Master, how did you get injured?"</p><p></p><p>"Let me heal you!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I, a mighty Hua Shen cultivator, still need..." Before Huo Jingtong could finish her words, she let out a moan and was forced to stop.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the pure Yin energy coming from Li Qing's hot palms, Huo Jingtong felt as if her whole body was instantly covered in ants, numb and itchy.</p><p></p><p>However, she was after all a Hua Shen cultivator, and quickly suppressed the strangeness in her heart. More than that, she was shocked by the pure energy that her disciple was continuously transmitting into her body.</p><p></p><p>After entering, this pure Yin energy seemed to act as a catalyst, stirring up waves in her cultivated moonlight power. After intertwining like overturning rivers and seas, the pure Yin energy completely merged into the vast moonlight power.</p><p></p><p>And the moonlight power, which Huo Jingtong had thought was already close to perfection, actually became even purer after this fusion. It even faintly carried a hint of profound Dao aura!</p><p></p><p>This was a sign of breaking through to the He Dao realm!</p><p></p><p>Words could not describe the shock and confusion in Huo Jingtong's heart at this moment.</p><p></p><p>A thought even arose in her mind, that it would be great if Li Qing's transmission of pure Yin energy would never stop.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the interweaving of the two powers, accompanied by the gradual rise of her cultivation that had been stagnant for a long time, Huo Jingtong's mind slowly became lost.</p><p></p><p>Who knows how long had passed...</p><p></p><p>Li Qing released his palms pressed against Huo Jingtong's back.</p><p></p><p>"Master..."</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong came back to her senses, and a blush instantly surged on her cheeks.</p><p></p><p>"My injury is healed, you go out first."</p><p></p><p>Feeling a little flustered, Huo Jingtong said repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'm relieved." Li Qing breathed a sigh of relief and left with his hands clasped.</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong watched Li Qing quickly retreat, and couldn't help but feel a trace of annoyance in her heart.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>From this day onwards, there was a different affection spreading between the master and disciple.</p><p></p><p>But Li Qing did not directly point it out, and always maintained the appearance of a well-behaved disciple who respected his master in front of Huo Jingtong.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Only in secret, the actions disrupting Liuyue Peak never stopped.</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong's divine sense enveloped the entire mountain peak, witnessing everything that happened within.</p><p></p><p>Although it was still absolutely absurd, what's done is done. Could she really kill all her disciples?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Qing did not lie. Under the influence of that mysterious extreme Yin power, the progress in the disciples' strength was evident to all.</p><p></p><p>So Huo Jingtong had no choice but to give up and let Li Qing do as he pleased.</p><p></p><p>She even took the initiative to set up a formation to conceal it, preventing disciples from other peaks from discovering it.</p><p></p><p>Nourished by the extreme Yin power of the Inverted Ethics Scripture, everyone on Liuyue Peak, while enjoying pleasure, also made rapid progress in their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Only Huo Jingtong alone did not enjoy this benefit.</p><p></p><p>And Li Qing seemed to have no thoughts about his own master at all, every move was extremely proper.</p><p></p><p>In this way, two years passed in a flash.</p><p></p><p>At the top of Liuyue Peak, in the closed-door room.</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong looked nervously at Li Qing in front of her, surrounded by a vast spiritual power, her heart filled with complex feelings.</p><p></p><p>"In just over two years, he's going to break through to the Demigod realm."</p><p></p><p>"This kind of cultivation speed is simply unheard of."</p><p></p><p>"If he successfully breaks through, won't his cultivation be equal to mine? If he forces himself on me..."</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong's mind was in a mess.</p><p></p><p>Then suddenly it disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"He really succeeded?!" Huo Jingtong looked at Li Qing, her mind in a daze.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you Master for protecting me during my cultivation!" Li Qing bowed with his hands clasped, genteel and refined.</p><p></p><p>But Huo Jingtong turned away, avoiding Li Qing's bow.</p><p></p><p>According to the rules of the Great Dao Sect, as long as the disciple's cultivation catches up to or surpasses the master's, they can henceforth address each other as peers.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if one respects the teacher and values the Dao, and does not distinguish their status based on strength, the master-disciple relationship can still be maintained.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing smiled slightly: "Even if one day I attain immortality, in my heart, Master, you will always be my master. My only master."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Huo Jingtong's body trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Li Qing's sincere face, she couldn't help but feel touched.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go. Liuyue Peak now has another Demigod cultivator, such a joyous occasion should be shared with others soon." Li Qing walked up and gently held Huo Jingtong's flawless white hand.</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong struggled symbolically, but did not break free.</p><p></p><p>So she stopped resisting.</p><p></p><p>On Liuyue Peak, there was a burst of indulgence.</p><p></p><p>And when passion ran deep, even Huo Jingtong couldn't escape the mundane in the end.</p><p></p><p>At night, after everyone else had fallen into deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing, feeling the vast Yin energy absorbed from Huo Jingtong's body, which he had never experienced before, nodded with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"The feedback from a Demigod cultivator is indeed extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>"This vast Yin essence is enough to support me in rapidly cultivating in the Demigod realm for a while."</p><p></p><p>"However, it's still not enough!"</p><p></p><p>With his soaring strength, Li Qing's ambition also swelled.</p><p></p><p>He began to set his sights on the other female cultivators of the Moonlight Lineage.</p><p></p><p>"Only the Immortal realm is my ultimate pursuit."</p><p></p><p>Under the shroud of moonlight, Li Qing's shadow was not revealed.</p><p></p><p>Only his face was hidden in the night, unclear to see.</p><p></p><p>The next day, after Huo Jingtong woke up, she pulled Li Qing to go into seclusion together.</p><p></p><p>The bottleneck that had trapped and troubled her for many years finally loosened a bit after last night's impact.</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong had a feeling that her advancement to the Harmonious Dao realm was not far off.</p>

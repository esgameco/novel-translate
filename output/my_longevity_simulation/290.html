        <h1>Chapter 290</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At first, they thought this was just an isolated incident and chose to stay in the ruins of the Chaoyuan Sect, refusing to disperse.</p><p></p><p>However, within a short span of seven days, more than a dozen skeptical cultivators successively turned into ethereal shadows.</p><p></p><p>Everyone finally faced reality and scattered like birds and beasts.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the popularity of the Chaoyuan Sect ruins was largely due to the lack of danger here.</p><p></p><p>Now that an unknown crisis had descended, not many cultivators were willing to take the fatal risk to explore without figuring out what exactly was going on.</p><p></p><p>After all, opportunities are always there, but you only have one life.</p><p></p><p>Only a small handful of people remained steadfast here.</p><p></p><p>"So, with such danger here, do you still dare to enter?" Shuo Feng looked at Su Xiaomei and asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The three of them had traveled together for dozens of days, getting along day and night, no longer as distant as when they first met.</p><p></p><p>Although this Shuo Feng was a Huashen Immortal Lord who had scattered his cultivation to start over, he never put on airs and was approachable.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, he would also occasionally guide Su Xiaomei and Zhang Haobo in their cultivation, benefiting them greatly.</p><p></p><p>And he would sometimes reveal his ambition to "scatter my cultivation and seek the invincible way. Invincible in Qi Refining, invincible in Foundation Establishment, invincible in Golden Core... until invincible in immortality!"</p><p></p><p>"My name is Shuo Feng. Pioneering the way and creating methods, I am the 'Shuo' (first) of the world; invincible in a hundred battles, I am the 'Feng' (sharp point) of the world!"</p><p></p><p>His occasional lofty bearing that looked down upon the world also made Su Xiaomei and the others secretly convinced.</p><p></p><p>Now seeing him ask, they were also stirred with heroic spirit in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"If you dare, why wouldn't I?" Su Xiaomei raised her head, not showing any weakness.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Haobo also showed no fear at all: "I'll accompany you to the end!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha! Straightforward!" Shuo Feng let out an unrestrained laugh and took the lead in walking into the Chaoyuan Sect ruins.</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei and Zhang Haobo glanced at each other and closely followed.</p><p></p><p>The moment they entered the territory of the Chaoyuan Sect, Li Fan lost his sensing of them.</p><p></p><p>It was as if...</p><p></p><p>They disappeared from this world in an instant and went to another world.</p><p></p><p>"Chaoyuan Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"Su Xiaomei and the others have good fortune on them, they shouldn't be in mortal danger."</p><p></p><p>"As for what exactly is strange in here, we can only know after they come out."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passed, arriving at the 26th year of the anchor.</p><p></p><p>The Yin sisters had both successfully established their foundation, giving Li Fan feedback of no small amount of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The two of them, after being still for so long, were moved to return to Yelan Island.</p><p></p><p>It just so happened that Su Changyu had been cultivating in seclusion all along, and no one was managing them.</p><p></p><p>So after leaving a message, the two quietly returned to their hometown.</p><p></p><p>The sisters settled scores one by one with those villains who bullied them on the island when they were young.</p><p></p><p>This matter need not be described in detail.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Li Fan finally received a message from Zhang Zhiliang.</p><p></p><p>Hurrying to the Strategy Formation Hall, Li Fan once again saw this master of formations.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Zhiliang didn't exchange pleasantries and went straight to the point: "The closed training in Tianyu Prefecture has begun."</p><p></p><p>"You prepare, and you can set off in a few days."</p><p></p><p>"I have engraved all the matters needing attention on a jade slip, you will know as soon as you look at it."</p><p></p><p>A golden shining encrypted jade slip was handed over.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't check it on the spot, put it away, and thanked Zhang Zhiliang.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Zhiliang's expression was indifferent.</p><p></p><p>A spirit-sensing ball flew in front of Li Fan: "Let me see if you have neglected your formation dao cultivation during this time."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took the spirit-sensing ball and skillfully answered the questions inside it.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, seeing the glowing dots on the spirit-sensing ball, Zhang Zhiliang nodded with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Then he took out a small black box and handed it to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"There are some things I prepared for you inside. A seal is set on it, and when the time comes, the seal will open by itself." Zhang Zhiliang looked at Li Fan and said deeply.</p><p></p><p>"The journey to Tianyu Prefecture is long. I applied for you to use the ultra-long-distance teleportation grand formation once, which can directly reach Tianyu Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>"The teleportation jade tablet needs to be used within ten days, otherwise it will dissipate on its own."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took the jade tablet, and saw that it was engraved with the image of an old man with a tall crown, exactly the same as the Heavenly Venerate statue in the Dharma Transmission Square.</p><p></p><p>"You may go!"</p><p></p><p>"Remember, don't lose face for me, Zhang Zhiliang!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Zhiliang waved his hand, dismissing Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan respectfully bowed and slowly retreated.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time to leave Congyun Sea too."</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, there are still avatars staying here, and they can take care of things when necessary."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, all alone with all his belongings in his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>With nothing to linger for, Li Fan simply left as soon as he said he would, and went straight to the Dharma Transmission Square.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the island teleportation formations that corresponded to each island in the Congyun Sea and were distributed in front of different statues.</p><p></p><p>The ultra-long-distance teleportation formation was set up inside the body of the Heavenly Venerate statue.</p><p></p><p>Walking to the foot of the Heavenly Venerate statue, Li Fan showed the teleportation jade tablet to the guarding cultivator.</p><p></p><p>After verifying the authenticity of the jade tablet, the cultivator made hand seals and pointed at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, Li Fan arrived inside the Heavenly Venerate statue.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he discovered that from inside the statue, the stone statue seemed to be transparent.</p><p></p><p>Without any obstruction, the surrounding scenery was clearly visible.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's current position was probably located at the heart of the Heavenly Venerate statue.</p><p></p><p>Looking down at Wanxian Island, the busy cultivators were only as small as ants.</p><p></p><p>"The scenery is not bad. Flying is not allowed on Wanxian Island. In so many reincarnations, this is the first time I've seen such a view."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>After sighing for a while, Li Fan flew forward according to the guidance.</p><p></p><p>A space filled with silver mist, brilliant stars shining.</p><p></p><p>The teleportation formation was located here.</p><p></p><p>Every time it was activated, it consumed a large amount of energy.</p><p></p><p>At this time, there was only Li Fan alone in this space.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan raised the teleportation jade tablet high.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the jade tablet disintegrated into dots of green light.</p><p></p><p>Shooting towards the stars in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Then, the illusory image of a large glowing cloud mass appeared in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>In the cloud mass, the miniature landscape of land and mountains could be vaguely seen.</p><p></p><p>"Tianyu Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan touched it with his spiritual sense and perceived.</p><p></p><p>The cloud mass image rapidly enlarged, focusing on the four central regions.</p><p></p><p>"Tianyu, Tianchen, Tianshu, Tianquan."</p><p></p><p>"These are the four major prefectures guarding the headquarters of the Wanxian Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered as if in thought.</p><p></p><p>Choosing Tianyu Prefecture as the destination, Li Fan activated the formation.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the stars all over the sky dimmed for it.</p><p></p><p>Time and space seemed to fall into a standstill.</p><p></p><p>Pressure thousands of times greater than ordinary teleportation formations came from the surrounding space.</p><p></p><p>Caught off guard, Li Fan's qi and blood immediately surged, and his heartbeat accelerated.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to circulate spiritual qi to regulate it, he found that it was out of control, as if it was running wild in his body.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding scenery also changed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The seven-colored light gathered and dispersed, and all the scenery was distorted and stretched.</p><p></p><p>Unable to even hear the sound of his own heartbeat, Li Fan seemed to have fallen into a state of deafness.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have passed for a long time, but also only an instant.</p><p></p><p>All the abnormalities disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Dizzy and disoriented, Li Fan, who had completed the teleportation, almost staggered and fell to the ground.</p>

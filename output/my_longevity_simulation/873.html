            <p>"Devouring your ability?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan couldn't help but be shocked. </p><p></p><p>The ability that Tianyang spoke of naturally originated from the spatial power of the "Ink Stone" derived from the essence of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>It was transformed by the laws of Xuanhuang, and once absorbed by cultivators through new methods,</p><p></p><p>even the current Xuanhuang Realm had no way to strip it away.</p><p></p><p>And in this bizarre and remote small world, it was actually being devoured?</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, don't worry. To me, those unknown existences are like ants crawling all over my body."</p><p></p><p>"It might be painful or itchy, but they can't threaten my life."</p><p></p><p>Tianyang transmitted an image, briefly expressing his meaning.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan didn't let his guard down.</p><p></p><p>This Hunyin Realm was obviously different from the situation detected by the 115th Immortal Alliance expedition team when they arrived.</p><p></p><p>On alert, Li Fan and Tianyang began exploring this Hunyin Realm.</p><p></p><p>This small world was not vast, and its area was not even as large as the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>But strangely, Li Fan didn't find the spiritual bodies described by the Immortal Alliance expedition team.</p><p></p><p>The vast earth was dim and gloomy, without any undulations in the terrain.</p><p></p><p>It was all composed of gray soil.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention animals and plants, there wasn't even a complete stone.</p><p></p><p>When his divine sense swept across the Hunyin Realm, apart from the two outsiders, Li Fan and Tianyang, there were surprisingly no other existences.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression was solemn as he took some of the gray soil from the ground and carefully observed it in his hand.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be ordinary soil.</p><p></p><p>But looking at his own hand, with just a moment of contact, it appeared as if it was burned, and Li Fan knew that this was definitely not something ordinary.</p><p></p><p>"No pain. The corrosion is silent." Li Fan's eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>A surge of vitality welled up from within his body, trying to restore the injuries on his hand.</p><p></p><p>But to Li Fan's surprise, this infused vitality seemed to have become nourishment for that scorched area!</p><p></p><p>The black spots on his palm quickly expanded, and it looked like they were about to spread to his entire body.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan decisively cut off his palm.</p><p></p><p>And what happened next made Li Fan's pupils contract in shock.</p><p></p><p>The severed flesh and blood palm, after falling on the gray soil,</p><p></p><p>seemed to fade and turn to ash like the remnants after being burned by flames.</p><p></p><p>Then it merged with the soil.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the world full of gray soil, Li Fan was horrified.</p><p></p><p>The bizarreness of this place somewhat exceeded Li Fan's imagination.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was considering leaving, Tianyang suddenly transmitted a message.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, the strength of the devouring force around here seems to be different in every place."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps we can identify where the anomaly is by the magnitude of the force."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan hesitated for a moment and nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's approval, Tianyang quickly flew over the Hunyin Realm while sensing.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he locked onto a location.</p><p></p><p>The "devouring force" there seemed to be extremely strong.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could even vaguely feel a strange fluctuation from Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>It was as if Tianyang was engaged in an intense battle with an equally matched opponent.</p><p></p><p>After staying for just a moment, Tianyang had no choice but to leave.</p><p></p><p>"It's like being devoured by tens of thousands of ants. Senior Brother, can't you feel it?" Tianyang asked through a transmitted message.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head and simply wielded the seven-colored divine light, flying towards that location.</p><p></p><p>Sure, here's the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Indeed, he didn't feel anything unusual.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan had a vague premonition in his heart. If he were to use his fire attribute spiritual power like before,</p><p></p><p>The consequences would probably not be as simple as his physical body being frozen into a withered sculpture.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Fan suppressed all the spiritual energy within his body.</p><p></p><p>He acted only by relying on his physical body and the power of the seven-colored divine light.</p><p></p><p>Arriving above the target location, Li Fan carefully observed, trying to find useful clues.</p><p></p><p>He indeed noticed something amiss.</p><p></p><p>The entire Hunyin Realm that he had previously explored was an absolutely flat place.</p><p></p><p>But that spot...</p><p></p><p>seemed to be slightly raised.</p><p></p><p>This time, with experience, Li Fan protected his right hand with the seven-colored divine light and dug open the soil.</p><p></p><p>He kept digging downwards, and suddenly, Li Fan touched a hard object.</p><p></p><p>With a solemn expression, he took it out from deep within the gray soil.</p><p></p><p>The gray soil accumulated on the surface disappeared soon after leaving the ground.</p><p></p><p>The hard object thus revealed its true appearance.</p><p></p><p>"This is?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was a bit stunned.</p><p></p><p>The thing in his hand was actually a human skull.</p><p></p><p>But unlike ordinary people, this skull seemed to have a third eye socket at the glabella, with a hole the size of an eye socket.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there were naturally existing gold and black patterns on the skull.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan turned the skull over to examine it, but he was somewhat horrified to find that the inside of the skull was like moldy.</p><p></p><p>One after another, the gray spots were shocking.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these gray spots seemed to have their own consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Having been dormant for who knows how many years, as soon as they sensed the presence of a living person around, they immediately wriggled strangely.</p><p></p><p>As if exploring the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>A sense of crisis that was difficult to describe in words suddenly welled up in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>He shot out streaks of seven-colored divine light, forming a perfect seal.</p><p></p><p>Isolating Li Fan's aura.</p><p></p><p>Only then did those gray mold spots calm down again.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the strange skull inside the seven-colored light ball, Li Fan slightly frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Having three eyes on the head, it looks human, but is also different. Obviously not someone from the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the gray mold spots were the cause of the catastrophe in the Hunyin Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that it was precisely because this outsider brought the gray mold spots here that caused this place to turn into a gray realm?"</p><p></p><p>"And the culprit was also eroded by the gray mold spots, not even leaving a complete corpse."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A possible answer appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"This place is the farthest from the Xuanhuang Realm and may have already reached the scope that other immortal realms can touch."</p><p></p><p>"This three-eyed person is from this immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>"Coming here to escape for his life?"</p><p></p><p>"But brought this terrifying gray mold spot over."</p><p></p><p>Scene after scene appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan discovered that the seven-colored divine light was not enough to completely resist the power of this gray mold spot.</p><p></p><p>Even just sealing it, Li Fan still felt the seven-colored divine light being constantly consumed.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the continuous replenishment of power from the Five Elements Grotto-Heaven, the seal would have probably been broken long ago.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan didn't put the skull back in its original place.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he tried to store it in his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Somewhat unexpectedly, it went extremely smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Without any obstruction, it was collected just like that.</p><p></p><p>And by observing through the storage ring, Li Fan found that the gray mold spots were still not in a state of stillness.</p><p></p><p>Not only were they consuming the power of the seven-colored divine light,</p>

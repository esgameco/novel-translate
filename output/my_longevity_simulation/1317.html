        <h1>Chapter 1317</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"The Carefree Dream Realm." The scenes of countless demonic cultivators devouring humans from the world he had just experienced resurfaced in Xun Erlang's mind. He could not fathom how those scenes could be associated with the words "carefree" at all. </p><p></p><p>The three of them looked towards the border of the Qiuxi State again. The demonic sect's world that was originally there had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>A white mist barrier had taken its place, obstructing everyone's vision.</p><p></p><p>"Can we go back now?" Wang Xuanba said excitedly. </p><p></p><p>But things were clearly not as simple as he had imagined. When the Great Xuan Trio tried to pass through the white mist barrier to return to their homeland...</p><p></p><p>What was originally just simple devouring mist had now become an impenetrable, solid barrier like copper walls and iron ramparts!</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba, who was at the very front, crashed straight into it and was dazed.</p><p></p><p>"It seems leaving the Carefree Dream Realm completely may not be an easy task," Yue Zhenwei said heavily.</p><p></p><p>The three of them involuntarily looked together towards the remaining two border worlds. </p><p></p><p>They had a feeling that perhaps only by completing the trials of all three worlds could they know what to do next.</p><p></p><p>The experiences of the Great Xuan Trio in the Carefree Utopia were transmitted in full and without a single discrepancy into Li Fan's mind through the silver eyes of the Lecture Platform.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Having undergone the cycle of reincarnation over a hundred times and witnessed the destruction of the Profound Yellow Realm, the revival of the Starry Sea, and the collapse of towering walls, Li Fan saw far more from the same experiences than these three Golden Dan disciples.</p><p></p><p>"It should only be the shallow layer of the Carefree Utopia. The construction of the dream still mixed in some events from the Profound Yellow Realm as a blueprint. For example, that giant rock by the Shilinjun Sea, and the purple lightning that descended from the sky to exterminate demonic beasts. The experiences and perceptions of cultivators in the Profound Yellow Realm would provide some help in exploring dreams of this level. They need to gradually grow stronger by passing through the trials of the border dream worlds before being qualified to enter deeper levels of the dream..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled. This pattern seemed very familiar to him.</p><p></p><p>"The Carefree Utopia seems to have its own set of rules. Let Xun Erlang and the others slowly explore to obtain more information about the Utopia."</p><p></p><p>Xun Erlang's trio was just the vanguard. Next, the disciples under the Holy Master would continuously journey to the Carefree Utopia one after another to gather information there.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "Though the Utopia is vast, even ants can sail through it!"</p><p></p><p>The reason Li Fan paid so much attention to the Carefree Utopia was because of the extremely conspicuous dark clouds over the territory of the Five Elders Council when he activated the Celestial Formation to destroy the world in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>Under those dark clouds, even beings that had already perished were sheltered.</p><p></p><p>One must know that when the Celestial Descent activated the "All Things Return to Nothingness" Grand Formation, even those who had inherited the Dharma could only struggle to survive.</p><p></p><p>Yet these dark clouds not only remained intact under the world-destroying celestial formation but also had the surplus power to save people...</p><p></p><p>According to Li Fan's previous understanding, with the strength of the five long-lived elders of the Five Elders Council, they should have been utterly incapable of achieving this!</p><p></p><p>No matter how many cycles of reincarnation Li Fan went through, he had never discovered this secret of the Five Elders Council. This showed just how deeply they had hidden it.</p><p></p><p>But in the storm of world destruction, these deeply hidden existences were all exposed.</p><p></p><p>"Besides the Carefree Utopia, there was one other thing on the side of the Five Elders Council that also withstood the assault of the Celestial Formation," Li Fan's gaze flickered.</p><p></p><p>The remains of the Dharma transmitters, the Soul-Crushing Tray.</p><p></p><p>In the 119th life, Li Fan had seen and heard of this object. In that life, the Myriad Immortal Alliance launched a surprise attack on the Five Elders Council by summoning the Dharma manifestation of a Celestial Chosen, forcing the Five Elders Council to hand over this so-called immortal alliance relic.</p><p></p><p>"Yet the remains of souls were still perfectly preserved even under the ravages of celestial power..."</p><p></p><p>"The entire area preserving the Soul-Crushing Tray had turned into nothingness, yet it remained unharmed. The Soul-Crushing Tray is no ordinary dharma artifact..."</p><p></p><p>Four words suddenly appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Eternal Lingering Thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Eternal Lingering Thoughts cannot be brought into Reversion to Truth. Neither clones nor spiritual projections can sense its existence. Only I myself can absorb it through Reversion to Truth."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, like Old Mr. White's skull, it is in the core area of their forces. Not so easy to lay hands on."</p><p></p><p>"This life, I can try to make a move and see if I can obtain these two things. If not, I'll just take them by force after the Dao Merger!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan let out a light snort, and his thoughts returned to the present.</p><p></p><p>Standing upright in the realm of the Profound Yellow, Li Fan held an ordinary steel rifle, his eyes slightly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>A chill that seemed to freeze all things suddenly descended upon Li Fan's head, only to disappear in an instant.</p><p></p><p>It was the Celestial Essence that Li Fan had summoned using his divine ability to deceive and transform the laws of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Before it fully manifested and descended, he had already canceled the spell.</p><p></p><p>Although the Celestial Essence appeared and dissipated, seemingly without leaving any trace, in this process, the steel rifle in Li Fan's hand seemed to have absorbed the power of the Celestial Essence, gradually becoming extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Flashes of silver light, a biting chill. Illusory snowflakes would occasionally drift around the barrel.</p><p></p><p>After just a few attempts, this steel rifle had transformed from an ordinary object into a truly supreme divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan once again used his ability to deceive and transform the laws of Heaven and Earth, but this time it was not the icy Celestial Essence, but flickering red flames.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh...</p><p></p><p>The crimson flames poured onto the silver-white steel rifle, and in an instant, a vivid image of nine dragons was etched onto the barrel.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the gradually intensifying hostility of Heaven and Earth here, Li Fan's figure flickered as he changed locations.</p><p></p><p>"I'll just call you the Blaze Dragon Frost Soul Rifle." Li Fan casually named the divine weapon he had just forged from the Celestial Essence and tossed it into the storage of tens of thousands of wondrous objects within the Lecture Platform.</p><p></p><p>Using the laws of the Profound Yellow Realm to manifest and forge wondrous objects - he had become increasingly adept at this.</p><p></p><p>Not only was it to prepare foundational materials for his students, but the main purpose was to constantly assess the specific state of the revival of the Profound Yellow Realm through these newly born objects of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>After so much time had passed, the advancement of the Profound Yellow Realm was still ongoing.</p><p></p><p>And because the ascension was concentrated within the depths of the Profound Yellow Realm, conventional methods could not gauge its specific progress. So Li Fan needed to find another way.</p><p></p><p>He could not help but be concerned about it.</p><p></p><p>The feedback from helping the Evil Thoughts return to the Profound Yellow's Heavenly Dao had still not arrived.</p><p></p><p>"After separating a portion of my thoughts to attach to Old Mr. White's body back then, the Profound Yellow's Heavenly Dao actually became incomplete. This deficiency was not made up for by absorbing the remnants of other realms. Instead, as it grew stronger, it became even more...apparent."</p><p></p><p>While forging man-made celestial wonders, Li Fan carefully observed.</p><p></p><p>"In short, the previous Profound Yellow Realm always had this shortcoming. Returning the Evil Thoughts of the Profound Yellow is equivalent to making up for this deficiency."  </p><p></p><p>"Marvelous! It seems that this life's ultimate Profound Yellow Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"It will be even stronger than what I had speculated." </p><p></p><p>As his thoughts swirled, another strange object came into his possession. </p><p></p><p>"Hm? This enhancement is almost negligible. It seems the assimilation is finally complete." Li Fan's heart stirred slightly as he looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>A wondrous feeling slowly surfaced in his mind. </p><p></p><p>After a short while, the connection with the Xuanhuang Celestial Realm was reestablished.</p><p></p><p>However, because the Lord Self possessed the basis of the Xuanhuang Apocalyptic Transformation, the Xuanhuang Realm naturally harbored hostility towards him.</p><p></p><p>The "celestial favor" he received in this life merely offset that hostility, with a slight surplus remaining.</p><p></p><p>It could not be compared to when he was the Sage Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"But since the attitude has shifted, there will be ways to increase goodwill going forward," Li Fan mused inwardly.</p><p></p><p>In the perception, Yin Shangren, Qiao Gong and others also gradually sensed the descent of the Xuanhuang celestial favor.</p><p></p><p>For cultivators from other realms like Qiao Gong and Baixiang, the sense of separation from the Xuanhuang Realm that had persisted for so long finally disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke was originally a person of celestial destiny. However, after imprisoning the Xuanhuang evil thoughts and the death of his companion spirit beast Xiao Hei, his celestial destiny had dissipated over thousands of years. But now, with this new celestial favor, Xu Ke's white hair turned black, and his hunched back straightened. In the blink of an eye, Xu Ke transformed from a decrepit old man on the verge of death into the composed image of a middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>As for Yin Shangren's reaction, it was rather peculiar. It was as if something exploded directly in his head - Yin Shangren's skull instantly turned into a cloud of blood mist.</p><p></p><p>From the wound on his neck, one could vaguely see the corporeal form within Yin Shangren's body crumbling inch by inch.</p><p></p><p>The little figure's face was twisted in a ghastly expression, constantly spitting out bloody foam and chunks from its mouth. The flesh on the outer body undulated, reabsorbing these vomited objects.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand, stopping the others who wanted to come to his aid.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren let out an eerie laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, this is a good thing for him," Li Fan reassured them.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren was a remnant ghost of the world. An amalgamation of remnants that could not be absorbed by the Xuanhuang Realm, he could only exist as a parasite within it, like a ghost.</p><p></p><p>Before this, the Xuanhuang Realm was aware of Yin Shangren's existence but ignored him.</p><p></p><p>But now, after Yin Shangren helped return the Xuanhuang evil thoughts, the Xuanhuang Realm's attitude towards him changed.</p><p></p><p>In other words, it had labeled Yin Shangren as "beneficial."</p><p></p><p>The consequence of this was that the Xuanhuang Realm began trying to accept him, integrating him into the natural cycle of the Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>If no other force intervened, then after a number of years, Yin Shangren would become an existence akin to the Stone Tablets or Ruomu, attached to the Xuanhuang Realm as a remnant ghost.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not lie - this could indeed be considered a good thing for Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, with the power of the Xuanhuang Celestial Realm's laws, he could crush the other remnant consciousnesses within his body, becoming purer and no longer going insane or losing his mind as before.</p><p></p><p>Secondly...</p><p></p><p>Within the Xuanhuang Realm, there was a large amount of "anomalies" left over from the process of devouring remnants.</p><p></p><p>These things that did not conform to the laws of the Xuanhuang Realm originally required the use of annihilating methods like the Ink Killing technique to completely eliminate them.</p><p></p><p>However, after Yin Shangren was integrated into the Celestial Realm's system, he could freely devour these anomalies. While becoming stronger himself, he would also help the Xuanhuang Realm purge its inner remnants - a win-win situation.</p><p></p><p>Although it was a "good thing" in various senses, Li Fan still saw conflicting thoughts from Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>If Yin Shangren himself resisted, it was entirely possible to disrupt this integration process.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression turned solemn as he transmitted his voice: "Why must you worry? After integrating with the Xuanhuang Celestial laws, you will essentially be no different from an immortal cultivator defying the natural order."</p><p></p><p>"With the revival of the Starry Sea, the Xuanhuang Realm as the only pure land within it for now may be able to use this reviving power to break through mortal limits and ascend into the legendary Immortal Realm. At that time, your achievements will be immeasurable!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the great trend of the Dao. Those who follow will prosper, those who go against will perish!"</p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's persuasion, Yin Shangren's struggling expression gradually calmed. Especially after hearing the words "Immortal Realm", his last shred of resistance disappeared.</p><p></p><p>His exploded skull regenerated.</p><p></p><p>The wound healed, muffling the sound of flesh being chewed within his body.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren returned to his original appearance.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to before when his mundanity hid a hint of madness, the current Yin Shangren seemed more akin to the Stone Tablets.</p><p></p><p>Ancient, profound.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Holy Master, for this blessing!" Yin Shangren and the others no longer used the previous address of "Dao friend", instead referring to Li Fan as "Holy Master" like students at a lecture hall.</p><p></p><p>After all, whether it was taking them to the center of the Starry Sea to witness the revival, or teaching them to purify and return the Xuanhuang evil thoughts to gain immense celestial favor - any of these deeds alone would be considered a rebirth.</p><p></p><p>For Yin Shangren and the others, Li Fan fully deserved to be called Holy Master.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang has completed its initial metamorphosis. Next, we need to put in effort to guide it and help it assimilate the remnants from various places. But before that, we still need to make some preparations."</p><p></p><p>"Please instruct us, Holy Master."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Xuanhuang has devoured its own evil thoughts and made up for its shortcomings, over thousands of years of cultivators devouring its lands, it has suffered some depletion. Like someone who hasn't eaten for a long time suddenly gorging themselves, abruptly stimulating it to assimilate remnants may lead to negative consequences," Li Fan explained the reasons.</p><p></p><p>Baixiang nodded slightly in understanding. "So what we need to do now is help the Xuanhuang Realm digest a remnant or two first? Where should we start?"</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang remnants are subtly interconnected as one. Pulling one hair moves the entire body. So using the remnants within the Xuanhuang Realm as primers is not feasible," Li Fan revealed a slight smile, looking at everyone.</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong couldn't help but look towards the void outside the Xuanhuang Realm. "So we need to go out and find world fragments?"</p><p></p><p>"But where can we find those? Previously we traversed half the Starry Sea, and all we saw were vast expanses of nothingness. It seems all the remnants of the Starry Sea have fallen into the Immortal Ruins!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren snorted coldly. "Then where did all the remnants the Xuanhuang Realm has devoured over the years come from?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly. "Correct. There are still many remnant fragments in the Starry Sea."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said solemnly, "At the edge of the Starry Sea, beneath the high walls!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Yin Shangren and the others were shaken to the core.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan waved his hand, and countless remnants appeared, stretching out like a magnificent, towering Great Wall.</p><p></p><p>The others couldn't help but be dazed.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 802</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After witnessing the scenery at the highest point of this world, upon returning to the foot of the mountain, one should still be able to correctly recognize their own position. This is also a manifestation of the immortal heart.</p><p></p><p>Temporarily putting aside the true immortal deeds outside the Xuanhuang Realm, Li Fan calmed his emotions and opened the Huanzhen panel.</p><p></p><p>This was already the 119th world he had experienced.</p><p></p><p>Current time: Anchored for 2 years.</p><p>Current location: Peak of Jieli Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Line after line of small text cascaded down like a waterfall.</p><p></p><p>Name: Li Fan</p><p>Realm: Mid-stage Golden Core</p><p>Physical age: 21/599</p><p>Mental age: 1368/9999</p><p>Void Replenishment progress: 16%</p><p>Anchor Replenishment progress: 0%</p><p>Current number of anchor points: 3</p><p>Current number of available anchors: 2</p><p>Bound items: "Thousand Mechanisms Jade Disc", Taiyi Boat, Remnant Stele of Cessation (damaged), Essence Blood of Ten Thousand People, Dao Transmutation Stone, Final Separation Disc</p><p>Techniques: Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Chant, Sitting Immortal Jue, Cloud and Water Illusion Dream Technique, Body Transformation Dao, Marvelous True Spirit Transformation, Furnace of Myriad Transformations Technique, Creation Kiln Technique</p><p>Divine Powers: Chaos, Infinite Void Replenishment Law, Thread Pulling Life Reduction, Heavenly Transformation, Inverse Five Elements Life and Death Sword, Life and Death Chains, Formless Killing Intent, Insect Binding</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Because he did not choose to retain his cultivation realm, but instead chose to keep the item "Final Separation Disc", Li Fan was still at the mid-stage Golden Core realm. His physical age limit also returned from 999 to 599.</p><p></p><p>However, for Li Fan, the upper limit of his lifespan was basically irrelevant. After all, in so many lifetimes, except for his mortal periods, he rarely had the chance to die of old age. Moreover, now that he had unlocked the "Incarnation" function, it was even more insignificant.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the upper limit of his mental age did not decrease with the regression of his cultivation. It seemed that this was somewhat related to Li Fan's mind and soul.</p><p></p><p>"Now, it only takes 6 years for 'Huanzhen' to be fully charged. This means I can enter the Xuanhuang Realm two years ahead of schedule."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze moved down and fell on the six Huanzhen bound items, and he couldn't help but frown slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Jade Disc, Taiyi Boat, Remnant Stele of Cessation..."</p><p></p><p>"These were all precious items I preserved during my mortal reincarnation struggles in order to escape the Daxuan World. Although they were extremely valuable to me at the time."</p><p></p><p>"But now, they are of little use. Most importantly, constantly displaying them on the Huanzhen panel is annoying."</p><p></p><p>"It would be great if there was a way to remove them."</p><p></p><p>Just as he was thinking this, suddenly a prompt from "Huanzhen" faintly came through.</p><p></p><p>"You can consume some anchor points to replace already bound items?"</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed a good thing. But there was no such replacement function before."</p><p></p><p>"The charging time has also decreased..."</p><p></p><p>"Has the ability of 'Huanzhen' been enhanced?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, then carefully sensed the other functions of "Huanzhen".</p><p></p><p>However, it was a bit disappointing that no other changes could be detected at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"Previously, I speculated that the charging speed of Huanzhen was related to my soul and will. Now it seems that it may also be related to some other unknown factors."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's because I've seen true immortals and broadened my horizons?"</p><p></p><p>"Has the so-called exploration degree increased again?"</p><p></p><p>Unintentionally thinking of the existence of true immortals again, Li Fan once more became a little shaken in his mind.</p><p></p><p>It was only after a short while that he could come back to his senses.</p><p></p><p>His attention returned to the "Huanzhen" panel.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing much to say about the remaining techniques and divine powers.</p><p></p><p>Although it looked like...</p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>They were very magnificent, and their actual performance was indeed extraordinary.</p><p>It could be said that they were unrivaled at the same level and could even kill those at higher levels.</p><p>But after seeing Mr. Bai, Chuanfa, and even the "True Immortals" take action,</p><p>Li Fan felt that these seemed a bit too flashy.</p><p>"In this world, it seems that the realm still surpasses everything."</p><p>"One level higher in the realm means absolute power suppression. It completely defies reason."</p><p>"An ordinary Hedao is not a match for a Changsheng Tianzun."</p><p>"And a True Immortal from Xianxu can annihilate Xuanhuang with a single glance."</p><p>"The so-called killing enemies at a higher level is nothing more than big fish eating small fish within the same realm."</p><p>...</p><p>Li Fan was silent for a while, with no trace of pride left in his heart.</p><p>But he quickly perked up again.</p><p>"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."</p><p>"One should proceed step by step."</p><p>"The 'Sitting Immortal Jue' has already ascended to the Hedao realm. For a long time, there will be no need to worry about the main cultivation method."</p><p>"The 'Infinite Void Method' is a divine ability that can enhance the soul. The soul is my only weakness. Whether facing Ruomu or Mr. Bai, I am almost defenseless..."</p><p>"I hope this divine ability derived from the Tianxuan Mirror can play a role to some extent."</p><p>With a clear understanding of the strength of those old monsters, Li Fan did not think that relying on this divine ability alone could completely defend against them. It would be a blessing if he could detect abnormalities the moment he was "contaminated".</p><p>Although, judging from what happened after he transformed in his previous life,</p><p>Mr. Bai indeed seemed to be an absolutely good person, with no intention of snatching his [Huanzhen]. In comparison, his series of operations appeared more like a clown, only provoking laughter.</p><p>But...</p><p>Who can guarantee that this is not a performance he put on for Li Fan, knowing that he could no longer find the location where Li Fan's body transformed?</p><p>So even if it happened again, Li Fan would still do the same.</p><p>Li Fan always puts his own safety first and will not easily trust anyone else.</p><p>Having said that, the gains are proportional to the risks.</p><p>In the previous life, although there were crises everywhere,</p><p>The harvest was even more abundant.</p><p>First, one thing was confirmed. Although the Chuanfa Tianzun was powerful and suppressed the entire Xuanhuang realm,</p><p>She was not an omniscient existence.</p><p>When Li Fan detonated a large number of chaos puppet talismans in various places in the Xuanhuang realm and took advantage of the chaos, the holy fetus Li Fan secretly used the Medicine King's True Cauldron to rush out of the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p>If the Chuanfa Tianzun truly had a clear understanding of everything in the Xuanhuang realm, then even if the Medicine King's True Cauldron was covered with a layer of material that shielded divine sense perception, and the Xuanhuang realm was affected by the chaos characters...</p><p>The Medicine King's True Cauldron would definitely not be able to escape from her control.</p><p>But it managed to do just that.</p><p>This is enough to show that the Chuanfa Tianzun still falls within the conceptual scope of a "cultivator".</p><p>She is just an extremely powerful cultivator.</p><p>Her behavior can be inferred based on experience and perception.</p><p>As for True Immortals...</p><p>It is completely impossible to speculate based on common sense, so it's best not to provoke them.</p><p>"The reason why Chuanfa appears to be unrivaled is that she attained the Dao through a new method. Later cultivators, as long as they cultivate the new method, will contribute and add a portion of power to her."</p><p>"The accumulation of thousands of years is enough to push her to an unfathomable level."</p><p>"To defeat Chuanfa, one must first destroy her foundation."</p><p>"This is also the reason why she personally appeared to erase the [Building Foundation with Me] method after it appeared in the world."</p>

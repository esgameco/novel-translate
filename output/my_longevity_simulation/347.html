        <h1>Chapter 347</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>His eyes widened, mouth slightly agape, wanting to speak but stopping short.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan was not shocked by the cruel decisiveness of Emperor Sanmo viewing the inner disciples as ants, what made him quite helpless was that the calm aura emanating from the white-bearded elder caused the possessed Xuan Bird to produce a trembling sensation from the depths of its soul.</p><p></p><p>Under the oppression of the innate superior's pressure, the Xuan Bird's thoughts seemed to be frozen in an instant, only its body instinctively trembling slightly, unable to make any other movements.</p><p></p><p>From the inherited memories of the Xuan Bird's bloodline, Li Fan instantly knew what a noble existence this intelligent beast in front of him was among the exotic beasts.</p><p></p><p>In the ancient era when the entire exotic beast tribe had not yet grown strong, Emperor Sanmo was already the prophet of the tribe, leading the tribe forward and developing with his unparalleled wisdom.</p><p></p><p>He was unconventional, and although he was an exotic beast, he always liked to transform into a human body.</p><p></p><p>Unlike many exotic beasts who were very averse to contact with humans, he was said to have traveled in the human world for hundreds of years and made many human friends.</p><p></p><p>He called on the exotic beasts to unite and contribute like humans.</p><p></p><p>He even studied many human cultivation methods, and then improved the cultivation methods of each race at that time, greatly increasing the cultivation speed of the exotic beasts.</p><p></p><p>The exotic beast tribe's ability to go from living in a corner to later spreading throughout the world, this Emperor Sanmo definitely made great contributions.</p><p></p><p>However, that was already who knows how many years ago.</p><p></p><p>But the appearance of the one in front of him was exactly the same as what the Xuan Bird's ancestors had seen.</p><p></p><p>The Xuan Birds reproduced for generation after generation, but Emperor Sanmo was still the same Emperor Sanmo.</p><p></p><p>Intelligent beasts are also long-lived beasts.</p><p></p><p>Because they live long enough and have seen enough, they possess wisdom that ordinary people can hardly reach.</p><p></p><p>It's just that a long time ago, Emperor Sanmo seemed to rarely show his face.</p><p></p><p>Disappearing without a trace, whereabouts unknown.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he quietly came to this Beast Taming Sect that was most hated by the exotic beasts.</p><p></p><p>It seems that Emperor Sanmo's status in the Beast Taming Sect is not low, taking the role of a leader.</p><p></p><p>The white-bearded elder discussed a few more words with Lu Ya, and then turned to look at the Xuan Bird possessed by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Slightly nodding his head, Emperor Sanmo said with gratification: "Being able to follow this child is also a fortunate thing for your Xuan Bird clan. Perhaps, it will be passed down longer than other branch inheritances."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Sanmo lightly stroked his long beard and plucked off a strand.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the white beard emitted a glowing white light, which he flicked into Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>The white light wandered around, and wherever it passed, vigorous vitality was revived.</p><p></p><p>The feeling of constantly getting stronger was several times more intense than before when inhaling and exhaling Xu Ke's exposed fortune.</p><p></p><p>It almost made Li Fan want to let out a cry of comfort.</p><p></p><p>After circling inside the body, the white light still did not dissipate, only dimming slightly.</p><p></p><p>So it began the next round of circulation.</p><p></p><p>Immersed in this gentle and warm vitality, Li Fan felt extremely refreshed in mind and spirit, and a wave of drowsiness surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Before falling into deep sleep, he only heard Lu Ya's slightly surprised voice: "Senior, you are..."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Sanmo's bestowment was definitely a great nourishment for the Xuan Bird.</p><p></p><p>Because Li Fan's journey to the Fallen Immortal Realm, which should have continued for more than three months, ended just like that without any clarity.</p><p></p><p>When he regained consciousness, he had already returned to the Tianxuan Mirror in the real world.</p><p></p><p>Although this journey was extremely short and similarly had no gains,</p><p></p><p>At least Li Fan knew that when he entered again next time, it should also continue the series from the time point after falling asleep.</p><p></p><p>With such a long build-up, the final gain should not be too shabby.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Fan was also very curious about what exactly the task entrusted by Mr. White was.</p><p></p><p>And what would be the final outcome of Lu Ya, Xu Ke, and that Emperor Sanmo.</p><p></p><p>After reviewing the experience in the Fallen Immortal Realm this time in his mind again, Li Fan pondered for a while. Seeing that Ji Hongdao still hadn't sent a summoning message, he once again devoted himself to cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Two months later, when the "Marvelous True Spirit Transformation" broke through to the Foundation Establishment stage, Ji Hongdao finally sent a message.</p><p></p><p>Concise and to the point, without a single wasted word.</p><p></p><p>"Within seven days, come see me at the Huanyu Branch."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't set off immediately, but first inquired about Xue Mu.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Xue, where are you now? Have you received Master Ji's summons?"</p><p></p><p>After the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, Xue Mu finally replied: "Fellow Daoist Li Fan, I am currently in Tianchen Province. Recently, Old Man Fisherman is said to be staying here, and compared to before, he seems to be interested in more things. There have already been three lucky ones who successfully obtained benefits from him. So I also wanted to come try my luck."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, luck was not on my side this time. By the time I arrived, he had already disappeared without a trace. I wanted to wander around some more, but then I received Master Ji's message."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan replied: "Opportunities and such cannot be forced. This task of constructing the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation is related to your and my future prospects, and cannot be delayed. Fellow Daoist, you should hurry back. I will wait for you in the city and go together with you."</p><p></p><p>Xue Mu's voice, overwhelmed with honor, immediately came: "Alright, what Fellow Daoist said is right. I will return right away."</p><p></p><p>In the hinterland of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, there were interconnected teleportation formations everywhere, so the journey was quite fast.</p><p></p><p>In just half a day, Xue Mu returned to Tianyu City.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go." Li Fan sized up Xue Mu, who looked a bit travel-worn but had much stronger energy than before, and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Sorry to keep Fellow Daoist waiting." Xue Mu said with a face full of guilt.</p><p></p><p>"Not at all." Li Fan waved his hand, not minding in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist broke through to the Golden Core stage just a year ago, but I observe that your aura seems to be not far from breaking through again?" Li Fan observed Xue Mu for a moment and asked with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>Xue Mu nodded: "Fellow Daoist has sharp eyes. It's strange to say, I haven't spent much time on cultivation recently. Most of the time, I've been visiting and touring the wonders of heaven and earth in nearby provinces. I didn't deliberately pursue the improvement of my cultivation, but under the influence of all kinds of magnificent heavenly rhythms, my cultivation has grown by leaps and bounds without me realizing it."</p><p></p><p>"On the contrary, when I cultivate by myself, the effect is not as good as I imagined."</p><p></p><p>He scratched his head in embarrassment: "I don't know what's going on either."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he paused, and said a bit uncertainly: "Perhaps, the influence of that [Wall of Mortals Becoming Gods] has not disappeared yet?"</p><p></p><p>"So miraculous? What did you see on that shadow wall?" Surprised by this answer, Li Fan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, they had already arrived outside the Huanyu Branch.</p><p></p><p>Stepping in one after another, this time there were no successive formations to greet them, but they directly arrived at a small courtyard with pleasant scenery.</p>

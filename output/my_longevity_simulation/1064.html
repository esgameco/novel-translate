        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1062 The 1057th Palm: Prelude to the End of the World</p><p></p><p>After receiving Li Fan's permission, Tianyang's body underwent an instant transformation.</p><p></p><p>A faint cyan light enveloped him, and his skin took on a metallic texture.</p><p></p><p>In a half-mechanical, half-childlike voice, Tianyang slowly said, "A body of flesh and blood has natural disadvantages. How can it compare to a body of metal and stone?"</p><p></p><p>"Like me, all kinds of rare materials in the world can be used to strengthen and nourish the body."</p><p></p><p>"The theoretical upper limit of the Great Dao is the limit of my body!"</p><p></p><p>As Tianyang spoke, he gently clenched his fist, as if an infinite suction force was generated from his palm.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a huge whirlpool formed in the depths of the Hua Ling River. The immense force it brought made it almost impossible for Li Fan and the three other Transmitters to maintain their balance in the turbulent flow.</p><p></p><p>After gathering his strength, Tianyang slowly threw a punch at Huang.</p><p></p><p>The three Transmitters' faces changed color.</p><p></p><p>But Huang was locked by the force of the punch, unable to move an inch.</p><p></p><p>At the critical moment of life and death, a golden light suddenly burst out from Huang's two heads and four eyes. The sound of his bones shattering inch by inch rang out like a rainstorm, and his originally thin body swelled up like a balloon in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>With his whole body covered in knife-carved, angular muscles, Huang let out a furious roar and raised his four hands in front of him, trying to block Tianyang's small fist.</p><p></p><p>A muffled boom, like a thunderclap, resounded.</p><p></p><p>Their fists collided and remained deadlocked.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Tianyang slowly withdrew his fist: "This time, I used 50% of my strength. But it's far from my limit."</p><p></p><p>"But it should be your limit."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Huang's entire body collapsed like soft mud.</p><p></p><p>After a brief shock, the Transmitters Zhou and Wei could see that Huang's life was not in danger.</p><p></p><p>It was just due to excessive consumption.</p><p></p><p>Huang, who had suffered a crushing defeat, was not furious or resentful. Instead, he began to ponder Tianyang's words.</p><p></p><p>"Replacing flesh and blood with a body of metal and stone?"</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had considered taking this path before.</p><p></p><p>However, as a human cultivator, he was ultimately hesitant about abandoning his flesh and blood and transforming into a puppet-like existence.</p><p></p><p>The key was that there was no precedent to follow.</p><p></p><p>Once the transformation was complete, there would be no turning back. If the power of a metal and stone body was not as good as a body of flesh and blood in the end, wouldn't he become a laughingstock among all the Transmitters?</p><p></p><p>But today, Tianyang's appearance showed him a brand new path that seemed to have unlimited prospects.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, this could be used to break free from the constraints of the Celestial Venerate and become the only Transmitter with eternal life." A dangerous thought emerged from the bottom of Huang's heart. Once it appeared, it began to erode Huang's mind unstoppably.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Li Fan, who was observing the subtle changes in Huang's expression, knew that the seed had been planted. He couldn't help but smile inwardly.</p><p></p><p>When the time came, Huang would inevitably seek Tianyang's help at all costs. When someone needed a favor, Li Fan had ten thousand ways to manipulate them.</p><p></p><p>With the help of that punch just now, Tianyang had secretly absorbed a large amount of Hua Ling River water.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the goal had been achieved, Li Fan let Tianyang return to his original state and come back to his side.</p><p></p><p>The transmitter of the Dao also hurried forward to heal Huang's injuries.</p><p></p><p>"This place is not suitable for staying long. Let's go back first and talk later."</p><p></p><p>The group then quietly flew out of the Hua Ling Creek.</p><p></p><p>The disturbance in the Hua Ling River water caused by the previous fight finally attracted the attention of the cultivators guarding the Hua Ling Creek.</p><p></p><p>However, after investigating for a while, they could not find the cause.</p><p></p><p>According to the Wan Xian Alliance's principle of not making trouble for themselves when there is no problem, they chose not to report this matter.</p><p></p><p>In the private small world of the Dao transmitter Zhou.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang's move this time crushed the Dao transmitter Huang, undoubtedly proving his longevity realm strength.</p><p></p><p>So everyone began to formally discuss the next step of the plan.</p><p></p><p>Still on the top floor of the neon light sea building.</p><p></p><p>Huang's injuries had already healed on the way back. One head had its eyes tightly closed, while the other head was secretly looking at Tian Yang behind Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang was also pretending to be asleep with his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>The discussion was still led by Li Fan, Zhou, and Wei.</p><p></p><p>"With the addition of Huang, the possibility of convincing Jiang to hold the 'Oath of the Dao Transmitters' is almost 100%."</p><p></p><p>"As long as we lure him out according to the plan, it will be fine."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan interjected in time, "According to the assessment of the elders of the Union and the actual situation of the Xuanhuang Realm, they finally gave a recommended plan."</p><p></p><p>"We need to create enough momentum, and the trouble in the Wan Xian Alliance that the non-Dao transmitter Jiang cannot solve. But we can't really destroy the Xuanhuang Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan paused and showed a mysterious smile, "You two, see how this plan is?"</p><p></p><p>He lightly tapped his index finger in the air, and a small golden light ball flew closer.</p><p></p><p>After checking the contents of the light ball, the Dao transmitters Zhou and Wei both showed a trace of surprise in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Good." After communicating, the two nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Okay. If that's the case, then our Myriad Realms United Association can start formal preparations. But to make the play look real, we still need the cooperation of you two."</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured. Although we have been expelled from the Dao Transmitter Council, we have been deeply involved for many years and still have some control over the various states of the Immortal Alliance. There will definitely be no problem in assisting your United Association to complete this world-destroying play." The Dao transmitter Zhou said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>After further discussion, Li Fan and Tian Yang left this place.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Lingmu Realm, Tian Yang poured out the Hua Ling River water he had taken. It was handed over to Qiao Gong and other specialists for research to see if it could be replicated and mass-produced.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan came to the "World Destruction" space and took out one of the experimental products.</p><p></p><p>Although it was said to be a play to attract the Dao transmitter Jiang, in Li Fan's view, this was a rehearsal for the final destruction of this world.</p><p></p><p>"Many arrangements can be laid out in advance through the hands of these Dao transmitters by taking advantage of this opportunity. The Dao transmitters are closely related to the Dao Transmitting Heavenly Venerate. At that time, even if the Faceless True Immortal and the Immortal Ruins Immortals can vaguely perceive that someone is plotting behind this, they will first suspect the Dao Transmitting side."</p><p></p><p>"The current strength of the Dao Transmitting, even if it can't directly contend with the True Immortals, it should be able to hold on for a while..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking like this, Li Fan turned on the full-load state of soul burning.</p><p></p><p>He began to make the props needed for the world destruction with the greatest efficiency.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, the originally somewhat empty world destruction space gradually became full.</p><p></p><p>The three-month preparation time passed in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Under the collusion of Li Fan and the three Dao transmitters, various unusual events began to appear in the states of the Wan Xian Alliance.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 419</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>At the age of twenty, Li Fan stood independently on the mountaintop, hands behind his back, gazing at the distant sea of clouds.</p><p></p><p>The morning sun rose slowly from the east, radiating countless beams of light, turning the clouds a crimson hue.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's young face displayed a hint of vicissitude in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"After enduring the passing of three thousand years, it seems that it has affected me as well," Li Fan sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he returned to the mountaintop.</p><p></p><p>Various events experienced during the period of embodying an object surged towards him like a tide.</p><p></p><p>It was a much longer period of time than the several hundred lifetimes he had experienced as a human before his transformation.</p><p></p><p>Even after embodying an object, he couldn't remember everything in detail as he could when in human form.</p><p></p><p>Although most of the three thousand years were spent in lonely isolation, lying on the ruined ground.</p><p></p><p>In a short time, he absorbed all the memories of the "Shattered Formation Jade Plate," causing Li Fan to feel the terrifying power of time that wears everything away.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, after spending nearly a day, he had completely eliminated the negative effects it brought and simultaneously organized the history of more than three thousand years in the Xuanhuang Realm after his fall.</p><p></p><p>Some things, like the struggles between the Xuan Net and the cultivators, were foreseeable to him even before embodying an object.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan did not expect the Xuanhuang Realm to collapse within a short thousand years. </p><p></p><p>"After the members of the 'Overturning Heaven Assembly' obtained the formation blueprint for the Celestial Xuan Locking Array, what exactly happened?" </p><p></p><p>"In theory, even if the battle between the two sides was intense, there should have been one side bitterly victorious. How did it end up as if they both perished?" </p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan couldn't help feeling a bit helpless.</p><p></p><p>At the crucial moment, that kid Han Wuyou switched off the lights, resulting in the loss of information for several hundred years.</p><p></p><p>"But, I can't blame him."</p><p></p><p>"Prior to the imminent decisive battle between the Overturning Heaven Assembly and the Xuan Net, the 'Shattered Formation Jade Plate' that I, an old acquaintance, sent him is full of mysteries. It even knew such top-secret information as the Celestial Xuan Locking Array blueprint."</p><p></p><p>"It really can't be taken lightly."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, he had already become a Nascent Soul cultivator, no longer the naive youth he once was. The final battle was crucial to the life and death of many cultivators in the Overturning Heaven Assembly."</p><p></p><p>"The choice to seal me away was reasonable."</p><p></p><p>"In consideration of the 'Furnace Hundred Transformations,' I won't hold it against you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly, reaching out to capture a black-feathered red-tailed bird from a tree on the mountaintop.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual energy wandered all over its body, closing his eyes in contemplation.</p><p></p><p>After a short while, Li Fan suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Releasing the bird, he took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>A golden light instantly enveloped his body, and in the light and shadow, Li Fan's body continuously shrank.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, the bird, which looked identical to the previous one, appeared on the mountaintop, devoid of any aura of a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Even the black-feathered red-tailed bird approached him curiously, considering Li Fan as one of its kind.</p><p></p><p>"That kid Han Wuyou does have extraordinary talents. He was able to comprehend such divine arts from the 'Heavenly Physician's Records' as a Golden Core cultivator."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed, reverting to his original appearance.</p><p></p><p>This startled the black-feathered red-tailed bird, which flew away.</p><p></p><p>After embodying an object, refined with Han Wuyou's efforts, Li Fan established a mystical connection with him.</p><p></p><p>This connection allowed the barely-existent true spirit of Li Fan to observe and perceive the world through Han Wuyou's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when Han Wuyou comprehended and practiced the 'Furnace Hundred Transformations,' Li Fan, who also had a deep understanding of the 'Heavenly Physician's Records,' was able to grasp this incredible art.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, as the years and cultivation increased later on, especially after the tragic deaths of Xiao Heng and others, his personality changed. Even the 'Shattered Formation Jade Plate' carried around from childhood had a hint of caution."</p><p></p><p>"However, I wasn't able to perceive the Divine Transformation methods that followed."</p><p></p><p>"But even if I had known, it would probably have been futile. After all, the 'Mystical World Salvation Technique' is likely still under the control of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head, turning his thoughts back to the future direction of the history of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Until the anchoring in the year 711, before I was sealed, although it seems like many things happened."</p><p></p><p>"In reality, they can be divided into two main categories."</p><p></p><p>"One category is the events that were destined to happen in the Xuanhuang Realm according to the established historical trajectory."</p><p></p><p>"For instance, in the year 51, the Eminent Bluewing Immortal failed to achieve longevity..."</p><p></p><p>Recalling the thunderous "Who is it?" before the complete disappearance of the Eminent Bluewing, Li Fan couldn't help but furrow his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if the ultimate destruction of the Xuanhuang Realm is related to this strangeness."</p><p></p><p>"Also, the group of Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance cultivators who walked out of the Elemental Eradication White Mist, seemingly dead but alive..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly paused.</p><p></p><p>"The Eminent Bluewing failed to achieve longevity and the appearance of seemingly deceased cultivators from the white mist..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>A glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"On the twelfth day, I learned from the man in black robe that the Eminent Bluewing Immortal had set up the 'Element Devouring Rebirth Great Formation' before his fall, attempting to reverse the laws of life and death to attain longevity."</p><p></p><p>"From the subsequent results, he ultimately failed."</p><p></p><p>"And the 'Who is it?' has two interpretations. One is that the process of the Eminent Bluewing defying the laws of heaven and earth was disrupted by someone."</p><p></p><p>"The other is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted his eyes, "The laws of life and death have been reversed. The path to achieving longevity has been taken by someone, and he was completely unaware of it before, hence the Eminent Bluewing's dissatisfaction."</p><p></p><p>"There are only a few powerful beings in this world who have achieved longevity. As a veteran expert in the Dao, the Eminent Bluewing wouldn't be unaware of how they achieved it."</p><p></p><p>"If this is the case, an individual in this world has silently become a Longevity Immortal, bypassing everyone's knowledge?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan found this speculation somewhat unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Then he felt some emotion, "The Eminent Bluewing launched the Elemental Devouring Rebirth Great Formation, even sacrificing the lives of numerous cultivators in Daozhou."</p><p></p><p>"But he never expected that he himself would fall into the hands of an overwhelming expert."</p><p></p><p>"Longevity Immortals..."</p><p></p><p>"The thoughts and actions of beings at this realm are truly unfathomable and unpredictable."</p><p></p><p>"In the previous life, amidst the fierce battle between the Xuan Net and the cultivators, these Longevity Immortals all seemed to have disappeared, never appearing throughout."</p><p></p><p>"Even when the cultivators were close to extinction, they remained indifferent."</p><p></p><p>In fact, Li Fan had speculations in his heart as to why this was the case.</p><p></p><p>The key lay in the towering golden obelisks erected all over Xuanhuang Realm after the reign of the Xuan Net.</p><p></p><p>The obelisks emitted beams of light into the sky four times in total.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan speculated that perhaps the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance intended to use the propelling force of the golden obelisks to break free Xuanhuang Realm from the influence of the 'Dao Mausoleum'.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1100: Old Acquaintance Becomes a Puppet</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's our tribesmen who die in the Dark Sea, they can't achieve this."</p><p></p><p>"Too light, too light."</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Dark Tribe explained, and Li Fan suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>It was still judged by the fluctuations caused by being in the Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's corpse completely did not conform to the normal performance of ordinary creatures after death.</p><p></p><p>"Either it's just an empty shell serving as a distraction, or..."</p><p></p><p>"This person is deeply favored by the darkness. After his death, the vast majority of his spiritual nature instantly returned to the Dark Sea. Only the decaying parts remain, slowly dissolving into the darkness." The leader of the Dark Tribe suddenly said another possibility.</p><p></p><p>"However, even the strongest priest in our tribe's history could not reach a state like his after death. Therefore, I'm more inclined to believe that what we see is just an empty shell."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan's eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>Just now, after hearing the words of the Dark Tribe leader, he couldn't help but be shocked for a while. But if the dark power here was connected with the Profound Sky King, then Mo Rubin's abnormality after death could be explained.</p><p></p><p>"But we can't take it lightly. The Profound Sky Sect is insidious and extraordinary, with various tricks emerging one after another. We still need to be careful and guard against it."</p><p></p><p>"No matter if he's really dead or not, my plan won't change because of it."</p><p></p><p>With a flash of thought in his mind, Li Fan asked about the details of Mo Rubin's corpse.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, the location where Li Fan saw him was obviously not here.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the Myriad Immortal Alliance actually found a way to resist the dark infection in such a short time and transferred him here.</p><p></p><p>"If it's really just a worthless empty shell, the Myriad Immortal Alliance wouldn't have gone to such great lengths to transfer it. In my opinion, the vortex that the Myriad Immortal Alliance stole from the darkness probably relies on Mo Rubin's corpse to achieve stability." Ingenious Artisan stated his opinion.</p><p></p><p>"This dark power has some similarities with the nature of Source Power Essence. According to common sense, if such a huge scale as the Dark Sea really has such a small vent, it will definitely form an unimaginable energy vortex. But here, it's a bit too calm."</p><p></p><p>Ingenious Artisan spoke with certainty, and the leader of the Dark Tribe was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He observed carefully for a long time before saying in surprise, "Emissary, what this immortal master said is correct! The originally turbulent dark power actually stabilized after being filtered through that empty shell!"</p><p></p><p>"Even the darkness can be soothed, just what..." The leader of the Dark Tribe's tone was startled and doubtful.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan immediately fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>If the Dark Realm is really related to the Profound Sky King, then apart from his former companions in the Profound Sky Sect, what could attract his special attention would probably be the statue of the Faceless True Immortal.</p><p></p><p>But it's not yet certain how much of an impact the True Immortal statue would cause if it appeared in the Dark Realm. So whether to do this or not still requires careful consideration by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The main task of this trip is to take the opportunity to study the mysterious dark power and inquire about Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>"Can we get close to here and secretly open a small gap connecting to the small world?" Li Fan asked, "With the effect of Mo Rubin's corpse, the fluctuations caused should not be too great."</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Dark Tribe</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a while, he gave an affirmative answer.</p><p></p><p>"But it's best not to stir up too much of the dark power, otherwise two vortexes of equal size are very likely to gradually approach each other due to their mutual interaction and form a larger whole."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, we're just drawing a little bit for research. We won't be too greedy."</p><p></p><p>Under the leadership of their chief, the Youzu people secretly opened another spatial passage almost right next to the base of the Wanxian Alliance. </p><p></p><p>This was originally their homeland, and with Li Fan and the others displaying their magical powers to conceal the fluctuations, it proceeded quite smoothly without being discovered by the people of the Wanxian Alliance from beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this may also be due to the fact that they were concentrating all their attention on guarding that huge vortex.</p><p></p><p>"It's truly amazing that the surging dark sea actually calms down here." Witnessing this miraculous scene in person, the Youzu chief couldn't help but exclaim in admiration.</p><p></p><p>And on the other side of the passage, in the underground world, as soon as the dark power left the cage, it reverted to its original nature.</p><p></p><p>It surged outward at an alarming speed, engulfing everything.</p><p></p><p>The last light in the underground world quickly disappeared completely. </p><p></p><p>Countless creatures died silently without knowing why.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the scale of this small underground world was not too large.</p><p></p><p>After quickly filling it up, the dark power began to flow back to the dark realm.</p><p></p><p>It was truly like the rising and falling tides.</p><p></p><p>And at the entrance connecting the underground world to the mortal realm, Li Fan keenly discovered that the darkness had begun to infiltrate.</p><p></p><p>It's just that they hadn't opened the passage yet, so this process was extremely slow.</p><p></p><p>"If we have to go in and out through here, I'm afraid it won't be long before the overflowing darkness is noticed by the Wanxian Alliance," Liu Ruchen said with a frown.</p><p></p><p>"I'll figure something out," Qiaogong Jushi volunteered. "The essence of source power and dark power don't mix. Perhaps we can build a buffer zone here. Of course, this may require a large amount of source power essence."</p><p></p><p>As Qiaogong Jushi said this, he involuntarily looked at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had no interest in these remnants of true immortal power. He had already accumulated a considerable amount during this period and had no special use for it. </p><p></p><p>However, he still pretended to ponder for a long time before reluctantly agreeing.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qiaogong Jushi was overjoyed and immediately took action, summoning his beloved creation to help.</p><p></p><p>A stunningly beautiful female immortal puppet obeyed Qiaogong's every command.</p><p></p><p>It used the same technology as the Tianyang immortal puppet, but it was unknown where Qiaogong found the puppet's personality.</p><p></p><p>It was when Qiaogong was building the "buffer zone" that he boasted and casually revealed her origin.</p><p></p><p>"Back when [Ancestor] collapsed, I barely survived the catastrophe and escaped my homeland. But some guys weren't as lucky as me. Their bodies were destroyed in the disaster, and only their consciousness backups were preserved and carried with me."</p><p></p><p>"Don't look at how obedient she is now, she used to scold me a lot! Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"Back in the Tianling Sect, I had also prepared a puppet body for her. But it was too rigid, I didn't like it. I played with it for a while and then lost interest and destroyed her."</p><p></p><p>"Unlike this one now, it's vivid and almost indistinguishable from a real person."</p>

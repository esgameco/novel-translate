        <h1>Chapter 635</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Zhou Qing'ang" once again took out a bribe to show sincerity.</p><p></p><p>Being old colleagues, He Zhenghao naturally readily agreed. Along the way, He Zhenghao also inquired whether Zhou Qing'ang had any plans to leave the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang laughed and said there was no such thing.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, He Zhenghao immediately felt relieved. Even Zhou Qing'ang, who was a close aide of the secret envoy, had no intention of avoiding disaster, indicating that although the arrival of the essence of heaven and earth might have some risks, they certainly wouldn't be too significant.</p><p></p><p>With his increasing confidence in his choice, he stopped overthinking. After persuading his daughter to leave, he began to deal with the matter of "secret realm cultivators joining the alliance."</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, this was no different from when he was guarding the Liuli Island, assisting the mortal world people to sneak out.</p><p></p><p>Charging fees per person, he handled it smooth and adeptly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his courage had grown far bigger than before, with no worry at all about being caught by the immortal alliance.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the joining of the Medicine King Sect's cultivators and the progress of whitewashing proceeded even more rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Batch after batch of cultivators were awakened after the refining of the bloodlines and joined the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, receiving contributions transferred by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>However, even with the billions of contributions on Li Fan, it was just a drop in the bucket.</p><p></p><p>To transfer all contributions before the Red Flame Burning Sea started, Li Fan secretly exchanged and acquired standard spirit stones from other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>While doing this, he once again contacted the Five Elder Council.</p><p></p><p>Still, through Zhou Qing'ang and the opposite contact. This time, their actions were much quicker than before.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Zhou Qing'ang once again met the responsible person from the Five Elder Council.</p><p></p><p>Dressed in familiar black clothes, the figure remained indistinguishable. However, it was clear that the person remembered the details of the previous transaction.</p><p></p><p>Opening the conversation, they asked, "Has the previous matter been settled?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang smiled faintly, "It seems this matter is indeed important to you. It's been quite some time, yet you still remember it."</p><p></p><p>The previous matter was, of course, when the Five Elder Council entrusted "Zhou Qing'ang" to investigate the ancient cultivator's identity unearthed from the ruins of the Zixiao Sect.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had already inquired about the matter from Jiao Xiuyuan, which conveniently served as a bargaining chip for this transaction.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator from the Five Elder Council nodded calmly, "Although the two sides are in a ceasefire period now, everyone knows that peace is destined to be short-lived. No one can predict when the war will erupt again. Moreover, it's only a general peace. In some places, the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance is still in a standoff with us."</p><p></p><p>"As for the current 'Xuantian Locking Shadow' of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, we have only found a way to counterbalance it. To completely dismantle its effect, we need more intelligence."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang's eyes flickered, showing no surprise, and nodded. </p><p></p><p>"I have already found out about the ancient cultivator's identity that was unearthed. What price are you willing to pay this time, Five Elder Council?" he asked with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>"Seriously?" It seemed to give the other party a big surprise. The cultivator from the Five Elder Council stood up directly, staring fixedly at Zhou Qing'ang.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang nodded proudly.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good!" The other party repeated several times in succession, "Your abilities, Futen Society, are indeed extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>"Just wait a moment. I'll report to the higher-ups immediately!"</p><p></p><p>The black-clad cultivator turned around, falling into silence.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang carefully observed, yet couldn't detect how the other party was contacting the official Five Elder Council. After all, it was the Five Elder Council's spy organization, and one couldn't underestimate it completely.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, the cultivator from the Five Elder Council returned.</p><p></p><p>With vigor in his voice this time, he began discussing the conditions with Zhou Qing'ang.</p><p></p><p>"The last batch of 'Genuine Temptation Fruit’ and 'Human Dust Stardust’ were both very useful and we need more..."</p><p></p><p>After some bargaining, they finally reached a deal at a price that both sides were satisfied with.</p><p></p><p>"It's urgent, the faster the transaction is completed, the better," Zhou Qing'ang hinted.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator from the Five Elder Council looked at him and nodded in understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, one more thing."</p><p></p><p>Just before the two sides completely signed the contract, Zhou Qing'ang suddenly asked, "I have some contributions that are a bit troublesome to trace. They need to be converted into standard spirit stones from a clean source that cannot be tracked. Can you help me with this as well?"</p><p></p><p>The cultivator from the Five Elder Council was stunned at first, thinking Zhou Qing'ang was retracting. But after understanding the conditions, he smiled and casually said, "It's nothing. No problem."</p><p></p><p>"How much do you need?" he asked.</p><p></p><p>"Not much, just around two or three billion." Zhou Qing'ang casually replied.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator from the Five Elder Council was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"How much...?" For a moment, he doubted he had misheard.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang repeated his request.</p><p></p><p>"This... Friend, please wait, I need to consult." He wiped his forehead, and his voice even trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang waved his hand and let him go quickly.</p><p></p><p>The consultation took longer than before, and the black-clad cultivator was almost exhausted.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, the higher-ups have agreed to your request. However..."</p><p></p><p>He seemed uneasy, "The list of goods mentioned earlier may need to be adjusted."</p><p></p><p>"Hold on! Hold on!" The black-clad cultivator hastily stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>"Everything can be negotiated! Friend, the amount of standard spirit stones you require is truly too much. Trying not to arouse the attention of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance will be even more challenging!" He explained.</p><p></p><p>"If it wasn't a difficult task, why would I come to you? I'd handle it myself." Zhou Qing'ang said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The elder council cultivator nodded repeatedly, not daring to object.</p><p></p><p>After further negotiation, they finally reached an agreement.</p><p></p><p>As a golden light flew into Zhou Qing'ang's body, the black-clad spy slowly dissolved and disappeared into the golden light.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no fear or panic on his face.</p><p></p><p>He just reminded Zhou Qing'ang of the location and details of the next trade.</p><p></p><p>After the black-clad spy completely disappeared, Zhou Qing'ang carefully observed the area for a moment, shaking his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"To be bound by an agreement, unafraid of life and death. It really is strange."</p><p></p><p>He then destroyed all traces here and quietly returned.</p><p></p><p>Ten days later, Zhou Qing'ang encountered another black-clad spy whose aura was very similar, but obviously not the same person.</p><p></p><p>Just like last time, the spy handed over a 'Clear Void Stone Mother,' containing all the required materials on the list.</p><p></p><p>After a brief check, Li Fan also informed the identity of the ancient cultivator unearthed by that spy.</p><p></p><p>"Wang of the Xuantian School?"</p><p></p><p>Upon learning this, the other party was clearly also very shocked.</p>

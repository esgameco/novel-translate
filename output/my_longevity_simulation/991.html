            <p>"Spiritual communication is inconvenient, so let's meet here instead. New69 Bookstore 85shux.com"</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I'll give you that exotic treasure."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I've been feeling like someone's been watching me lately, so I need to be careful."</p><p></p><p>After Mo Rubin sent the location information, he suddenly disappeared without a trace again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sensed the glowing dot on the map that appeared in his mind, and remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a test? Or a trap?"</p><p></p><p>Ever since making the decision to "temporarily observe the situation and not return to reality for now", Li Fan had always felt a bit uneasy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But after thinking it over and clearly discerning himself, he still couldn't find the source of his uneasiness.</p><p></p><p>"Not returning to reality for now should be fine, so what exactly..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned slightly. </p><p></p><p>His spiritual intuition had always been very accurate. The current feeling was like walking in a dense forest, the direction of progress was correct, and there was no immediate danger of beasts attacking.</p><p></p><p>But the crisis sensed in the dark told Li Fan that there must be something he had overlooked.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew that the source of the uneasiness should come from that faceless immortal stone statue.</p><p></p><p>"Mysterious Heavenly God Statue, Mysterious Heavenly Dharma King..."</p><p></p><p>The image of Mo Rubin suddenly flashed through Li Fan's mind, and he immediately made a decision.</p><p></p><p>"Although he should already consider me as one of his own people now, I must still be on guard. New69 Bookstore 85shux.com"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled the scene of Mo Rubin devouring the Dharma transmitter Feng.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Li Fan also conducted a preliminary analysis and guess of Mo Rubin's abilities.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Senior Sister Zhao's [United as One], Mo Rubin was more like "mirroring and assimilating".</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can maintain my original mind and not be bewitched by that illusory mirror thread, I should be able to delay the assimilation time. I have the Seven-Colored Divine Light, plus the Immortal Heart Mantra protecting my body. If I really can't defeat him, running away shouldn't be a big problem."</p><p></p><p>"If it really doesn't work, I can also release the Hundred Flowers Taoist to attract firepower. He's at least at the Eternal Life Realm, so he should be able to block for a moment."</p><p></p><p>The uneasiness that couldn't be dispelled and whose cause couldn't be detected made Li Fan's thoughts much more complex than before. Therefore, he appeared even more cautious.</p><p></p><p>After making ample preparations, Li Fan quietly arrived at the agreed location.</p><p></p><p>On the border of the four central states of the Immortal Alliance, an ordinary mountain peak in Tianchen State.</p><p></p><p>The stone mountain towered high into the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Hidden under the sea of clouds, there was an inconspicuous stone cave halfway up the mountain.</p><p></p><p>At first extremely narrow, only allowing one person through. After walking a few dozen steps, it suddenly opened up.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin had already been waiting inside for a long time.</p><p></p><p>There was no aura of formations or restrictions outside the stone cave, but from the outside, one couldn't sense the aura of cultivators inside at all. New69 Bookstore 85shux.com</p><p></p><p>Only after stepping into the stone cave and coming before Mo Rubin did one finally notice.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of safe base is this? I didn't encounter any obstruction and just walked right in boldly." Li Fan snorted, saying very disdainfully. </p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin smiled: "Brother Xingwang, you are unaware. The reason it was so easy is because I had informed you of the location of this hidden cave heaven in advance. If you had come to search alone without knowing anything...</p><p></p><p>"... The entrance cannot be perceived by spiritual consciousness. Even if you see it with your own eyes, you will subconsciously ignore it and search in vain! The wonders of heaven and earth's creation are such that even with our immense strength, we cannot fully comprehend them!" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan ignored Mo Rubin's exclamation and said impatiently in a cold voice, "Enough, don't talk about these useless things. Where's that exotic treasure that can deduce the formation?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin shook his head and then casually threw an object over.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan caught it and was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>The result was somewhat different from what he had expected. It was not one of the Dissociation Discs, but a green cube that he had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>"What is this thing..." </p><p></p><p>As soon as Li Fan lightly touched the cube, it instantly decomposed into tens of thousands of even smaller cubes.</p><p></p><p>Like living things, they gathered, dispersed, and combined in the air, forming patterns with regularity.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully observed one of the small cubes and discovered that it was surprisingly composed of hundreds of formations.</p><p></p><p>"Formation Crown?" A name suddenly appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>But he did not reveal the fact that he knew about this object, and only looked up at Mo Rubin, wanting an answer.</p><p></p><p>"This is the [Lifeless Formation Crown], which was recently discovered and handed over by the Lancang State of the Immortal Alliance," Mo Rubin explained in detail.</p><p></p><p>"Simply put, a Formation Crown is the superimposition of hundreds or thousands of formations. And this Lifeless True Crown was formed by the continuous change and derivation of an ordinary Formation Crown."</p><p></p><p>"It is said to be left by a Formation Master at the Hua Shen level who fell due to a bizarre incident. After research by the Immortal Alliance, it was initially determined that there was an anomaly in the fusion process between the wonders of heaven and earth and the bizarre extra-dimensional rules, which led to changes in the Formation Crown itself."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan naturally understood the meaning of Mo Rubin's words at once. The wonders of heaven and earth are the manifestation of the laws of the Xuanhuang Realm, while the bizarre are the distorted and remnant laws of those devoured worlds.</p><p></p><p>But after the two fuse, some incredible changes will occur.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan previously comprehended the true origin of the bizarre, he had envisioned this possibility. Unfortunately, he had not encountered a real example for so long. Unexpectedly, Mo Rubin took it out casually.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, with the advantage of the resource scale that the Dharma transmitters can mobilize, it is not something that he can make up for in a short time even with multiple reincarnations and foresight.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew about this object, but Sun Xingwang couldn't possibly know.</p><p></p><p>Pretending to be overwhelmed by the explanation, he directly interrupted Mo Rubin, "Alright, alright, don't chant. Just tell me how to use this thing."</p><p></p><p>"The Lifeless Formation Crown is constantly evolving. Formations beget formations, endlessly. You only need to engrave the [Mysterious Heavenly Lock] formation into it every once in a while and let it naturally evolve. It's like beasts fighting each other - the one that survives in the end is definitely the strongest." Mo Rubin explained to Li Fan without any anger.</p><p></p><p>"That's easy, but it sounds a bit unreliable..." Li Fan muttered while examining the green Lifeless Formation Crown.</p><p></p><p>"There's no problem. Although it's a bit uncontrollable, it can definitely achieve our goal. Engraving the Mysterious Heavenly Lock is time-consuming and laborious. I'm at the headquarters of the Immortal Alliance now, under the eyes of many. It's not very convenient for me to act. I can only hand it over to you." Mo Rubin said solemnly.</p>

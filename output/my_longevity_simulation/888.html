        <h1>Chapter 888</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>In the following period of time, the Dharma Ancestor's Dharma Image appeared quite frequently. </p><p></p><p>Within a month, it appeared a total of five times.</p><p></p><p>On one occasion, there was even only a two-day interval between appearances. </p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Fan thought that using such a big move, the thirty-three Immortal Chosen Ones would have to pay a considerable price at the very least.</p><p></p><p>But from this frequency, it seemed that it was not as he thought.</p><p></p><p>Each time, the Dharma Transmission Image appeared in a different state of the Five Elders Council, forcing several Celestial Venerables of the Council to take action, before quietly disappearing again.  </p><p></p><p>Moreover, what was even more frightening was that each time this Image flashed by, it seemed to become more and more "vivid".</p><p></p><p>From the beginning, the technique was just opening both eyes.</p><p></p><p>Later on, it slowly tried to strike with its palms.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Image was improving at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p><p></p><p>It was hard to imagine, if it tried enough times, whether it would really become the same as the real Dharma Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"No need to reach Dharma Ancestor's level, even with just one-tenth of his power, it would be enough for the Five Elders Council to drink a pot."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Council is so anxious. They sent several messages in a row, wanting me to help probe the background of the thirty-three Immortal Chosen Ones."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sneered: "Unfortunately, this time I'm really powerless."</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the Five Elders Council, Li Fan focused his attention on the new guest who had arrived at the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was being led by Shang Tianci, touring various places in the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even younger than Shang Tianci, but on his somewhat immature face, there would occasionally flash a hint of evil aura. </p><p></p><p>"I say, Tianci, this small world has nice scenery. But to forcibly call it the 'Myriad Realms United Conference', isn't that a bit of a misnomer?"</p><p></p><p>The visitor was none other than Yan Fangzhou, whom Shang Tianci had gone through great pains to bring here.</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou said somewhat disdainfully: "The so-called myriad realms united, just this few people? It really made me excited for nothing, I thought I could finally do something big."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid let alone subverting the Myriad Immortals Alliance. Just the Martial Arts and Dharma Protector Hall of this Shilin State alone, you guys probably can't handle it, right?"</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci's face reddened, and he was about to retort.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, he heard an icy voice abruptly ring out: "Young in age, big in words. Let them come and try?"</p><p></p><p>This voice was like the wrath of heaven and earth, echoing endlessly in this small world.</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou's expression changed slightly, wanting to find the owner of the voice. </p><p></p><p>But he found that he had unknowingly been isolated, and Shang Tianci beside him had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The entire world seemed to be infinitely expanding, and he felt like an ant between heaven and earth, feeling the sky was high and the earth was vast, endless.</p><p></p><p>And because of what he had just said, he seemed to have angered the heaven and earth here.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the changing winds and clouds, unimaginable killing intent enveloped him.</p><p></p><p>"Putting on an act!" Yan Fangzhou was after all a generation's prodigy, how could he be so easily frightened.</p><p></p><p>A black flame phantom suddenly appeared behind him.</p><p></p><p>The instant the black fire appeared, the originally turbulent sky immediately came to a standstill.</p><p></p><p>An aura of annihilation emanated from this black flame.</p><p></p><p>The killing intent of heaven and earth all froze, and then fell into annihilation.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>The surrounding scene shattered like broken glass, exploding in layers.</p><p></p><p>A hint of triumph couldn't help but appear on Yan Fangzhou's face.</p><p></p><p>But soon, this bit of complacency disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Because what appeared before him immediately after was still the vast world filled with endless killing intent just now!</p><p></p><p>It seemed that what he had shattered was merely an illusion!</p><p></p><p>"No matter how many layers you have, I will break them all!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou snorted coldly, and the black flames shot into the sky like a meteor flying in reverse.</p><p></p><p>Wherever it passed, the space all seemed to be frozen and fell into a state of stillness.</p><p></p><p>And then it was crudely crushed by the black trajectory.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding scene suddenly changed again, and the original scene appeared once more.</p><p></p><p>The black long line did not lose momentum and charged straight ahead.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, who knows how many layers of heaven and earth it had shattered.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>No matter how many layers he shattered, the scene that appeared outside and surrounded him remained the same as before.</p><p></p><p>It was like an endless maze. Even if he ignored the walls of the maze and directly broke through them,</p><p></p><p>He simply could not see the end, so he could only be trapped in this maze forever.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the confidence on Yan Fangzhou's face slowly began to disappear.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it turned from disbelief to panic.</p><p></p><p>When he finally determined that he could not break through the blockade of this space-time, his face suddenly changed several times.</p><p></p><p>"You think you can subdue people with such little tricks?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou said loudly to the world that had trapped him.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, to his disappointment, the other party seemed to not have heard his words at all.</p><p></p><p>There was no reaction at all.</p><p></p><p>A trace of sharpness flashed in Yan Fangzhou's eyes, and he took out a golden talisman shrouded in wisps of lightning.</p><p></p><p>He threw it into the air.</p><p></p><p>But to his surprise, this [Space-Breaking Talisman], which had always been effective in the past, had now lost its use.</p><p></p><p>Not only did it fail to break open the space and create an escape route,</p><p></p><p>Instead, it seemed to be lost, spinning aimlessly in the air.</p><p></p><p>Next, Yan Fangzhou tried all his life-saving methods one by one.</p><p></p><p>None of them worked!</p><p></p><p>At this point, Yan Fangzhou was truly panicked.</p><p></p><p>"I admit defeat!"</p><p></p><p>"I shouldn't have boasted! The Myriad Realms Alliance is indeed worthy of its reputation!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou suppressed the viciousness in his eyes and shouted to the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Please allow me to join the Alliance, senior!"</p><p></p><p>The sky was silent, still without any response.</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou was stunned for a moment, thinking that the other party had not heard him, and shouted a few more times.</p><p></p><p>The result was still the same.</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou was a little dazed now.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci looked at Yan Fangzhou, who had suddenly stood still, and felt a little strange.</p><p></p><p>He called out a few times, but the other party seemed to not have heard him at all.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he finally realized that something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>Around Yan Fangzhou, there seemed to be an invisible barrier surrounding him.</p><p></p><p>Not only could outsiders not touch him, he also seemed unable to sense the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"Senior..." Shang Tianci said weakly, looking at Li Fan who had suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"The young man is not bad, he just needs some tempering. Let him hang for a year or two first." Li Fan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>In his hand, a wisp of black flame flickered and jumped incessantly.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to want to break free from Li Fan's hand.</p><p></p><p>But it was tightly controlled.</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci did not dare to refute and could only lower his head and agree.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at Yan Fangzhou, who was trapped by his Infinite Law, and stroked his chin.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Yan Fangzhou was immediately transferred outside the Black Jade Gate Tower of the Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Like a figurine, he was posed in a suitable posture.</p><p></p><p>"When he breaks down, let him out."</p><p></p><p>"It will also be convenient for training."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 758</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"The Overarching Sect..."</p><p>Liu Wenyu muttered in a low voice, full of shock. His eyes were fixated on the Terminal Disk above his head, and he even unconsciously reached out to caress it. </p><p>As a spy infiltrating the Five Elders Sect, he who had almost been driven to a dead end by the Celestial Treasure Manual, was all too aware of how precious this thing was.</p><p>"What is this?" Liu Wenyu couldn't help but ask.</p><p>"The Shielding Heaven Disk," Xu Bai said indifferently. With a thought, the Terminal Disk instantly turned illusory, causing Liu Wenyu to grasp at nothing.</p><p>Liu Wenyu finally came back to his senses abruptly. </p><p>Reluctantly taking his eyes off the Terminal Disk, he solemnly cupped his hands and said, "Fellow cultivator must have an urgent matter to seek me out this time."</p><p>Xu Bai snorted, "Indeed. I have come to demand justice!"</p><p>"Ah?" Liu Wenyu was stunned.</p><p>"Not long ago, one of the united cultivators controlled by our organization's Reality Temptation Fruit showed signs of losing control. Fortunately, we discovered it in time and took other measures before he succeeded in betraying us. Otherwise, our Overarching Sect would have suffered devastating losses this time," Xu Bai said with an unpleasant tone.</p><p>"Didn't you say the Reality Temptation Fruit was a creation of the Celestial Lord, guaranteed to be infallible? How could there be such a loophole?"</p><p>"Just spouting nonsense! No wonder you've been suppressed to such a state by the Myriad Immortal Alliance," Xu Bai glanced at him and said slowly.</p><p>"The Reality Temptation Fruit failed?" Liu Wenyu looked horrified, but soon shook his head repeatedly.</p><p>"This is absolutely impossible. As long as the Celestial Lord still exists in this world, no united cultivator could possibly defy His power," Liu Wenyu said with absolute certainty.</p><p>Xu Bai said solemnly, "But that united cultivator's loss of control did indeed occur. What is the reason for this?"</p><p>"Fellow cultivator, please calm down and recount the details of the incident."</p><p>So Xu Bai fabricated an incident about a united cultivator who, after realizing he was being controlled, wanted to rebel - omitting names and specific details.</p><p>After pondering for a while, Liu Wenyu replied, "It's possible that you used the Reality Temptation Fruit incorrectly."</p><p>Xu Bai flew into a rage, "So you're saying it's our problem? We strictly followed your original instructions."</p><p>Liu Wenyu quickly explained, "The Reality Temptation Fruit can distort a cultivator's thinking, making them deeply believe even the most outrageous things. But cultivators are not puppets after all. They still have their own thoughts. If the fabricated lies are too simplistic, when they realize it contradicts their own understanding, although they won't doubt it, they may try to verify it in various ways."</p><p></p><p>"For example, if you instill in a united cultivator the notion that 'he is actually just an ordinary person without any cultivation base,' he will indeed live like an ordinary person. But if one day he accidentally kills another Spirit Embryo cultivator, the conflict between fact and perception will force him to find the reason for the contradiction - a reason that can convince himself."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, the gap between perception and reality may plunge the cultivator into insanity."</p><p></p><p>"Another example, if you tell a united cultivator that..."</p><p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Through the [True Temptation], the idea of the Dao Cultivator being eternally loyal has been instilled. But if he were to detect this, he may realize that this idea was influenced by something. Although he would still be loyal to you, the way he acts might be... 'somewhat extreme,' as you said."</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu paused for a moment, glancing at Xu Bai before continuing, "He might think that the Xuanhuang Realm is full of dangers. If he is not strong enough but is exposed, his life could be in jeopardy. So he might think it's best to imprison you in a dungeon, letting you cultivate there until you reach the Dao Realm. Only then, when you have enough power to venture through the Xuanhuang Realm, should he release you."</p><p></p><p>"Although to outsiders, this might seem twisted and unreasonable, in their mindset, this is perfectly normal and logical."</p><p></p><p>"In our Five Elders' Association, there was a case of a loyal cultivator who defected to the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance. He was still loyal to the Five Elders, but he believed that the Transmission Venerable's strength was unfathomable, and we could not match it. Ultimately, he thought the only way was to surrender and merge with the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance to have a chance at survival."</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu said with some helplessness, "He had eloquent arguments, even constantly persuading our members of the Five Elders' Association."</p><p></p><p>"There are quite a few such people. We call them 'Deluded Cultivators.' They are the result of the Venerable's incomplete understanding of the Dao and the conflict with the overall Heavenly Dao of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>As Liu Wenyu explained, Xu Bai's expression gradually relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"When we set up the lie initially, we tried to make it as comprehensive as possible. Who would have thought such a thing would still happen..." Xu Bai snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu was also somewhat helpless: "After all, he is a Dao Realm cultivator. It's inevitable. If he were so easy to control, wouldn't our Five Elders' Association have long since unified the Xuanhuang Realm? How could we have ended up in this situation?"</p><p></p><p>"So what do we do now? This is such an important matter, yet you didn't explain it clearly during the initial transaction. It's impossible to let him go, and long-term imprisonment will raise suspicions. Could it be that we should just kill him and frame you?" Xu Bai asked.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu was startled and quickly said, "Fellow Daoist, don't be rash. I believe there is still a way to salvage this."</p><p></p><p>"First, we can use the [True Temptation] again to repair the breach."</p><p></p><p>"Secondly..." Liu Wenyu's expression became somewhat strange, "We can proactively reveal the truth to him and then persuade him to 'un-delude' himself."</p><p></p><p>"Please explain more clearly," Xu Bai's expression darkened.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu lowered his voice, "Let's use the example of the cultivator who defected to the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance again. He defected because he thought our Five Elders' Association was no match for the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance. If we can use solid evidence to convince him that the strength of the Five Elders' Association surpasses or at least matches the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance, he will return to our side."</p><p></p><p>"After all, the loyalty to the Five Elders' Association in his mind has never changed."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai immediately understood the other's meaning.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if this 'persuasion' process is combined with the True Temptation, the effect will be even better," Liu Wenyu added.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Xu, I wonder if your Covering Heaven Association still needs the [True Temptation]?" he asked.</p>

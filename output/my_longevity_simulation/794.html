        <h1>Chapter 794</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Mr. Bai had naturally already guessed that Li Fan had abandoned his physical body and entrusted his [incarnation] to an object. The scattered and fleeing [Wanling] withered branch puppets, and the Medicine King's True Cauldron that rushed into the sky. Even any of the scattered objects on the scene could possibly retain a bit of Li Fan's true spirit. The best time to distinguish had already passed, and even he could no longer see where Li Fan had gone. Fortunately... He didn't come for this in the first place. With a sweep of his sleeve, a force surged from his body. The [chaos] character fluctuations dispersed in Changsheng Valley slowly subsided. Mr. Bai flew to the center of the valley, in front of a group of children with somewhat pale faces but determined eyes. Sweeping the ruins on the ground flat, Mr. Bai was not particular and sat on the ground. He showed a calm and amiable smile: "Come here, children. There's not much time left." Mr. Bai's breath was calm and gentle, making people forget the calamity they had just experienced and involuntarily relax. The group of children looked at each other and obediently sat down. These children, including Gu Xinghan, were the ones who were abducted by Fang Zaiji of the Medicine King Sect and later granted the [Establishing Foundation with Me] method. Fang Zaiji had a secret method to identify people with insight. Therefore, the aptitude of these little ones was frighteningly high. Each of them was not inferior to Zhang Haobo and the people from Lijie back then. Originally, Li Fan wanted to rely on them to comprehend the [Establishing Foundation with Me] method and solve the secret of [Enlightening Oneself]. Then, the final disk could completely shield against the [Tianxuan Mirror]. But things didn't go as planned, and the situation in this world took a sharp turn for the worse. Li Fan, who discovered his own abnormality, was frightened by Mr. Bai. He only thought of fleeing for his life in a panic, but he couldn't wait for any of them to succeed. Fortunately, Mr. Bai, who synchronized with Li Fan's memories, also knew about this matter. "How is your cultivation of the [Establishing Foundation with Me] method?" He asked softly, trying to keep his tone gentle. Like facing a teacher who was assessing their knowledge, the children were a bit nervous. For a while, none of them dared to speak first. Fortunately, with Mr. Bai's constant encouragement, they gradually started to speak out their insights one after another. Mr. Bai listened attentively, nodding slightly from time to time. Then, he began to check the physical conditions of the children one by one, showing a pensive expression. This scene fell into the eyes of the three Dao-merging experts of the Medicine King Sect. Not long ago, when the chaos character domain was dispelled by Mr. Bai, their strength had already fully returned to normal. However, they were intimidated by the other party's terrifying strength and didn't dare to make any moves. They dismissed the other irrelevant disciples and obediently waited on the side. They just looked at each other and watched Mr. Bai, who was seriously getting along with the children, with an inexplicable expression, not knowing what this big shot was up to. "Old Fang, you are knowledgeable and experienced. Can you explain to me what exactly happened?" Liu Sanyu glanced at Li Fan's corpse, which no longer had any breath, and asked through voice transmission. "Do I even need to say it? It's so obvious! Our sect master provoked someone he shouldn't have provoked and was chased and killed by the other party!" Fang Zaiji sighed with emotion: "I'm too familiar with this kind of thing." Jiang Yushan remained silent, while Liu Sanyu's eyes twitched. "It's good that he died like this." This thought suddenly flashed through his mind. Let alone the three Dao-merging experts of the Medicine King Sect, each harboring their own thoughts. Mr. Bai seemed to have truly forgotten about everything else, patiently discussing the [Establishing Foundation with Me] method with the children. He didn't look down on them because of their young age. Any...</p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Every word he said was met with a response. His attitude was amiable. As a result, in a short period of time, the children grew fond of Mr. Bai. From being passive to taking initiative, they chirped away, sharing with him the various difficulties and insights they encountered while attempting to cultivate the "Building Foundation with Self" method. After hearing the children's specific situations, Mr. Bai quickly and thoughtfully proposed guidance and advice for each of them, encouraging them to try cultivating again.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the children all closed their eyes and immersed themselves in cultivation. Mr. Bai's eyes never left them, carefully and cautiously observing every change in the children. In the current Xuanhuang Realm's Heavenly Dao, it was "Borrowing the Wonders of Heaven and Earth to Build the Foundation of the Dao". The "Building Foundation with Self" method seemed to still be within the new law system. In reality, it had already broken free from the shackles and could be said to be going against the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, soon, these children who tried again opened their eyes one after another. Their cultivation ended in failure once more. Mr. Bai, as expected, was not discouraged. He patiently asked each of them about the new problems they encountered this time. After checking their physical conditions, he quickly proposed improved cultivation plans again.</p><p></p><p>Liu San and the others, who witnessed this scene, were all inexplicably shocked. "Teaching according to one's aptitude, all beings are equal." As elders of the ancient law's unified sect, their insights were naturally not shallow. They instantly realized how astonishing Mr. Bai's actions were. Being able to cultivate oneself and being able to teach others to cultivate are two completely different concepts! Moreover, this mysterious and exceptionally handsome expert did not seem like someone who could not cultivate.</p><p></p><p>The three still did not dare to disturb. Fang Zaiji even had a sudden inspiration and took out an imprint stone, intending to secretly record this scene of Mr. Bai teaching. This small action naturally could not escape Mr. Bai's eyes. He turned his head and glanced slightly. Liu San's breath immediately stopped, fearing that Fang Zaiji's behavior would anger this expert. Fortunately, Mr. Bai did not choose to pursue the matter further. He just continued teaching the children.</p><p></p><p>"He..." "He is both teaching and learning." Jiang Yushan, who had been silent all along, seemed to have discovered something. A hint of shock flashed in her eyes as she transmitted her thoughts. "Building Foundation with Self..." This mysterious foundation-building method was still taught to these children by Li Fan before his fall. Liu San recalled the contents of the method while carefully listening to Mr. Bai's explanations, and his eyes gradually lit up.</p><p></p><p>Just like that, Mr. Bai and these heaven-defying children became each other's teachers. With a total of thirty-five individuals with different physiques as experimental subjects, they continuously experimented and improved the "Building Foundation with Self" method. This originally extremely difficult to cultivate, heaven-defying method was also undergoing version updates at an unimaginable speed. Time slowly passed during this process.</p><p></p><p>Finally... The first child successfully built their foundation appeared. An inexplicable aura descended upon the scene. Gu Xinghan stood up abruptly, examining his refreshed body, his little face full of excitement as he said, "Teacher..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, the entire Changsheng Valley suddenly shook violently. Mr. Bai put away the smile on his face and shielded the children behind him. He looked up at the sky: "You've finally found us."</p>

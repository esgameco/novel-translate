            <p>Using the efficacy of medicine as a fulcrum, stirring the hidden power within the body.</p><p></p><p>"Poof!"</p><p></p><p>Spitting out blood, which startled Master Guangyangzi.</p><p></p><p>"The Creation Furnace Technique" had begun operating.</p><p></p><p>Master Guangyangzi hurriedly went to prepare the medicinal materials for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, Li Fan carefully examined his own physical condition.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the relevant case records in "Heavenly Healing Scripture" and contemplating the countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>His body was extremely weak, feeling dizzy and dizzy moments later.</p><p></p><p>So he could only empty his mind, rest quietly.</p><p></p><p>After accumulating a bit of strength again, he continued to contemplate.</p><p></p><p>And so on.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Li Fan, in accordance with the "Heavenly Healing Scripture," improved the prescription he had taken during the second "simulation" process.</p><p></p><p>After some persuasion, he finally convinced Guangyangzi to change the medicine.</p><p></p><p>The new prescription had outstanding effects.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the "Creation Furnace Technique" continuously improved his physique.</p><p></p><p>After two months, Li Fan could barely walk on land.</p><p></p><p>"Young junior brother, you are truly amazing! I didn't expect the prescription to be really effective! How did you know?" Second Senior Brother Ling laughed, assisting Li Fan while asking.</p><p></p><p>"It just popped into my mind!" Li Fan widened his eyes and said innocently.</p><p></p><p>"Young junior brother is extraordinary! Maybe you are the hope of our 'Physical Transformation Path'!" Third Senior Brother Lian Chang praised uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan just chuckled foolishly.</p><p></p><p>"The first step can be considered successful."</p><p></p><p>"The key now is to become stronger than Senior Brother Sixing within six years before the Immortal Declaration arrives."</p><p></p><p>"To replace him in the war, avoiding witnessing the tragic scenes of the members of the Physical Transformation Path perishing one by one."</p><p></p><p>"This is where Master Tianyang's persistence lies."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Sixing, at the Golden Core level. It would be a fool's dream to surpass him within six years by following the conventional cultivation path."</p><p></p><p>[By the way, the current best app for reading and listening to books, install the latest version.]</p><p></p><p>"I can only take a different path."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes sparkled.</p><p></p><p>One day, he secretly found Master Guangyangzi.</p><p></p><p>"Self-transformation?" Master Guangyangzi's face changed drastically when faced with the inquiry from his little apprentice.</p><p></p><p>"Where did you hear about this? Did that brat Ling laugh spread rumors again?" Master Guangyangzi, with an angry tone, scolded.</p><p></p><p>"Master, it was my own idea," Li Fan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"The magic of our 'Physical Transformation Path - Self-Transcendence' technique lies in the ability to assimilate with external objects."</p><p></p><p>"But suddenly, I thought, what is considered an external object?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother's sword, Second Senior Brother's pen, Third Senior Brother's clock, these are all external objects."</p><p></p><p>"So, can my weak body also be considered an external object?"</p><p></p><p>"Through continuous training of the technique, senior brothers' 'incarnation objects' become stronger. If I can consider my body as an 'incarnation object,' does that mean I can change my constitution?"</p><p></p><p>"I won't be as weak as I am now."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said slowly and carefully.</p><p></p><p>Master Guangyangzi's expression also changed continuously.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Tianyang, you are truly a genius! At such a young age, you have such insight, truly..."</p><p></p><p>Master Guangyangzi stroked Tianyang's head, somewhat relieved, saying, "With a disciple like this, our Physical Transformation Path will prosper!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, practicing the 'Physical Transformation Path - Self-Transcendence' technique can indeed lead to 'Self-Transformation'," Master Guangyangzi suddenly turned serious, looking at Li Fan and said gravely, "However, my disciple, you must never attempt it."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked up at Master Guangyangzi, his face full of confusion. "Why, Master?"</p><p></p><p>Master Guangyangzi's expression became somewhat absent-minded, hesitated for a moment, then explained to Li Fan, "The essence of 'Self-Transcendence' lies in 'Unity of Substance and Self.'"</p><p></p><p>"'Self-Transformation,' theoretically, can indeed be achieved. It is also the most perfect choice in the technique."</p><p></p><p>Master Guangyangzi sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Too difficult! Too difficult!"</p><p></p><p>"Compared to ordinary items, how complex is the human body?"</p><p></p><p>"Items can be continuously tried to pursue compatibility with oneself. If there are mistakes in the training process, only the 'incarnation objects' will be damaged."</p><p></p><p>"But 'Self-Transformation' requires the continuous use of one's own body as an experimental field."</p><p></p><p>"Any slight misstep will result in serious injury."</p><p></p><p>"The loss of the body is secondary. The most terrifying thing is the damage to the spirit."</p><p></p><p>A hint of sadness flashed in Master Guangyangzi's eyes. "Once, I had an extraordinary senior brother. His talent was unmatched, the best I've ever seen in my life."</p><p></p><p>"He was recognized within the sect as the 'First Person of Self-Transformation Path in a Thousand Years,' with high hopes from our master."</p><p></p><p>"However, he was arrogant, thinking that he could surely succeed in practicing 'Self-Transformation.'"</p><p></p><p>"Ignoring all advice, he forcefully trained."</p><p></p><p>"As a result..."</p><p></p><p>Master Guangyangzi paused.</p><p></p><p>"At first, he was just a little crazy, and everyone thought about helping him heal."</p><p></p><p>"But later, his madness became more severe. Completely unable to distinguish between reality and illusion."</p><p></p><p>"One night, he went on a killing spree."</p><p></p><p>"The number of dead was uncountable."</p><p></p><p>"Since then, our Physical Transformation Path has declined..."</p><p></p><p>Speaking of this, Master Guangyangzi shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"So, dear disciple, remember. You must never attempt it!" Master Guangyangzi sternly reminded Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded heavily. "Yes! I understand, Master!"</p><p></p><p>After bidding farewell to Master Guangyangzi, Li Fan returned to his room.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a long time, Li Fan gave up his plan to forcibly train in Self-Transformation.</p><p></p><p>Just like 'Foundation with Me,' this Self-Transformation was indeed not something an ordinary person could achieve.</p><p></p><p>"Puppet..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to the divine puppet he would become years later, an idea gradually formed in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Li Fan found several senior brothers and told them that he wanted a puppet.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, young junior brother. Leave it to me! I've been having a lot of inspiration recently and have written several books in a row. They can be considered the peak of my career!" Second Senior Brother Ling assured while patting his chest. "I'll sell them in the market and pick you the most handsome puppet!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Several days later, Li Fan finally got his mechanical puppet as he wished.</p><p></p><p>Ling smiled with satisfaction, "Young junior brother, this puppet is said to have the strength of the Golden Core level. I spent a lot of effort to buy it!"</p><p></p><p>"You are really amazing, Senior Brother! Thank you!" Li Fan praised, then picked up the puppet and ran off.</p><p></p><p>"This junior brother's body is recovering better and better!" Ling smiled marveled.</p><p></p><p>In a secret room.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan placed the puppet in front of him and cut a wound on his hand.</p><p></p><p>Dripping fresh blood on it.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he activated the 'Self-Transcendence' technique, feeling the subtle changes happening on the puppet.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan gave up his plan for Self-Transformation, but not entirely.</p><p></p><p>His plan could be seen as a special form of Self-Transformation in certain circumstances, even more extreme.</p><p></p><p>That was to discard his own body and completely transform himself into the puppet. Just like what the real Tianyang did in history.</p><p></p><p>However, Tianyang later chose to absorb the earth fire to temper and elevate the puppet.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Tianyang, Li Fan's approach was to become the puppet and then Self-Transformation.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, this was a self-destructive approach.</p><p></p><p>The gap between the Golden Core-level puppet and the human body's limit was immeasurable.</p><p></p><p>But for Li Fan, who urgently wanted to boost his combat power, it was the best choice.</p><p></p><p>The precision of the puppet was far beyond that of the human body, making it easier to achieve 'Unity of Substance and Self.'</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, there was no need to worry about personal injury. The repair of the puppet was much easier, as long as there were sufficient materials.</p><p></p><p>And after the completion of 'Puppet Self-Transformation' cultivation, in a state of 'Unity of Substance and Self,' the combat power that could be erupted would be several times stronger than simply treating the puppet as an 'incarnation object.'</p><p></p><p>"The first thing to do is to sacrifice the body and merge with the puppet."</p><p></p><p>This technique from 'Self-Transcendence' circulated smoothly for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Tianyang's body was a premature birth, so his soul and body were not very coordinated," Li Fan thought.</p><p></p><p>In this way, Li Fan secretly began his own training plan, without the other members of the Physical Transformation Path noticing the changes in him.</p><p></p><p>Even Master Guangyangzi did not perceive the changes happening to his little apprentice.</p><p></p><p>He only thought that Li Fan was deeply fond of the puppet that Ling had purchased for him and kept it close to him at all times.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, six years had passed.</p><p></p><p>The alert to the Immortal Declaration arrived.</p><p></p><p>The three members of the Physical Transformation Path, the senior brothers, were arguing about who should go for the selection.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan appeared in front of them with his puppet.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Sixing, Ling Xiaoren, Lian Chang, I think I should go."</p><p></p><p>Looking at Li Fan's serious expression, Ling Xiaoren was bewildered, and he stopped speaking in the middle.</p><p></p><p>Because just now, the words had come from the mouth of the puppet following Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Bam! Bam!"</p><p></p><p>The puppet stepped forward and approached the three of them.</p><p></p><p>"Going to the battle means risking our lives. If we're going, naturally we must send the strongest among us!" Li Fan looked at the senior brothers and said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"Young junior brother, what are you talking about? This is not a joke..." As Ling Xiaoren spoke, he suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>Because the words just now were spoken by the puppet that followed Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Little junior brother, don't be ridiculous! What kind of rule is it for a senior brother to send a junior brother to his death?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan flashed past, waving his fists, coming to stand beside Senior Brother Sixing.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, you must not underestimate me!" Li Fan said, feeling the force approaching.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the looming danger, Sixing's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>He waved his long sword, attempting to stop Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>But the sword that had always been invincible when it fell on Li Fan left no trace, unlike before.</p><p></p><p>The puppet's body was not only extremely tough but also faster than an ordinary golden core cultivator.</p><p></p><p>In between the moves, various strange mechanisms shot out from its different corners.</p><p></p><p>For a while, Sixing had to dodge awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>"Young junior brother, you've put in a lot of effort," Sixing praised enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>"I also have a skill. Please allow me to teach you, junior brother."</p><p></p><p>"Divine will is like water, formless above all!"</p><p></p><p>"Sword name: Heaven's Form!"</p><p></p><p>The flowing sword energy of Heaven's Form instantly arrived.</p><p></p><p>After the collision with the puppet's body, instead of being blocked and dissipated as before, the sword energy, like light, bent back and attacked Li Fan again.</p><p></p><p>Moving in a curve, it reached instantly.</p><p></p><p>The sword energy of Heaven's Form became faster and faster, looking like a giant net that was gradually enveloping the cumbersome puppet in the center.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, most of the puppet's spirit skills could not be displayed.</p><p></p><p>Under Sixing's continuous attack, Li Fan gradually fell into a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>"Extraordinary cultivators of old should not be underestimated," Li Fan thought, with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>The puppet let out a loud roar, emitting a dim red light.</p><p></p><p>Vibrations and transformations occurred, and in an instant, the humanoid body disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In its place, a giant hand appeared.</p><p></p><p>It skillfully bypassed the sword light blockade formed by the Heaven's Form, arriving above the web of swords.</p><p></p><p>Then it expanded.</p><p></p><p>The shadow of the hand wrapped all the sword lights within the water-like sword energy net, and then it pressed down sharply.</p><p></p><p>This was the 'Overturning Palm' that the puppet displayed.</p><p></p><p>"Good magical technique!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Sixing exclaimed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"I also have a move. Please teach me, junior brother!" Li Fan replied.</p><p></p><p>"Tianyang, with your sword form!"</p><p></p><p>The water sword formed by the Overturning Palm disappeared instantly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt a faint but strange danger.</p><p></p><p>"Woop!"</p><p></p><p>The invisible sword energy flashed through.</p><p></p><p>Before the giant hand could press down, a thin crack appeared on its back.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared at the area.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't find Sixing's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>Another sword mark emerged.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan tried to heal his wounds by mobilizing his spirit power but found that the wound seemed to be attached with invisible sword energy, hindering the healing of the wound.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of sword marks became faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan's body became covered in scars.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, surrender!" Sixing's voice came from all directions.</p><p></p><p>He himself, however, had remained invisible.</p><p></p><p>"The senior brothers all have great skills!" Li Fan sincerely admired.</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly raised his voice.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll wait and see!" Sixing responded.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan restrained his momentum.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he said to Second Brother Ling with a smile, "Second Brother Ling, let me borrow the pen from you!"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Ling was momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, sure!" Then a ink brush flew over, caught by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Infusing his spiritual power into it, Li Fan waved it in the air.</p><p></p><p>It was...</p><p></p><p>A character, 'Chaos.'</p><p></p><p>As the character 'Chaos' appeared, terrifying cracks suddenly appeared on Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>Unable to maintain the form of a giant hand, the puppet reverted back to its human form and fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of consumption..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was somewhat stunned.</p><p></p><p>The body made of special stone was disintegrating.</p><p></p><p>Many areas directly exploded.</p><p></p><p>This was the 'Chaos Stone' that Li Fan comprehended in the Mysterious Domain, and the magical technique he derived from it. Its power far exceeded Li Fan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>The practitioner faced such a dreadful side effect.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention confronting the senior brother Sixing who was hit by the 'Chaos' character.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding scenery suddenly quieted down.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, like shattered glass, it burst into pieces.</p><p></p><p>Turning into dots of light, they all rushed into Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of years ago, the memories belonging to the real Tianyang emerged vividly.</p><p></p><p>This included the 'Self-Transcendence' technique, the puppet refining method, and even the 'Earth Fire Upgrading Array' to elevate the puppet's level, such as these techniques, all engraved in the mind as if personally experienced.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan didn't have time to check these right now.</p><p></p><p>Because his spirit was completely drawn to the hint from 'True Return.'</p><p></p><p>"Though dead, still exists, the true spirit remains eternal."</p><p></p><p>"Transforming the body into an object, traversing through eternity."</p>

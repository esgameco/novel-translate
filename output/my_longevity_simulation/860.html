        <h1>Chapter 860</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the protective formation that Lin Ling had previously set up around this small mountain temple, the dazzling golden light emitted from Ji Shaoli's hand would have immediately attracted the attention of other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"This... this..." Zhong Shentong was dumbfounded, pointing at Ji Shaoli, unable to utter a complete sentence for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, it's a pity that it's not a purple gold or dark gold light sphere. But it's still acceptable," Ji Shaoli said calmly, reaching into it and rummaging in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>The golden light gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>In its place was a round bead emitting a seven-colored aura.</p><p></p><p>The moment he witnessed this seven-colored bead, Zhong Shentong's heart was filled with an inexplicable and complex emotion.</p><p></p><p>There was greed, a sense of loss, and even more regret.</p><p></p><p>It made him feel uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"Seven-colored Jade Void Flowing Light..." The moment Ji Shaoli touched the bead, information about this object naturally appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>It originated from a cultivation world called [Chongyan].</p><p></p><p>In this world, there was no sun or moon in the sky, only seven colored lights that appeared in turn, illuminating the world.</p><p></p><p>Later, a great cultivator collected and refined these seven flowing lights.</p><p></p><p>Although he achieved a supreme magic treasure, it also directly led to the destruction of the Chongyan realm.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, this cultivator had long since perished. The magic treasure he refined had even fallen into the fishing pool.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's heart was extremely shaken.</p><p></p><p>Not only because the grade of this seven-colored divine light was extremely high, surpassing ordinary combined Dao.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, even in the fishing pool, magic treasures of this level were only of the golden rank.</p><p></p><p>Then, what kind of terrifying existence would those purple gold and dark gold light spheres be?</p><p></p><p>And what level of magic treasure was this fishing pool that could contain them all?</p><p></p><p>"It's definitely not an ordinary immortal artifact."</p><p></p><p>"But they are all ownerless..."</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened in the immortal realm?"</p><p></p><p>Thousands of thoughts surged in his mind. Ji Shaoli did not directly refine this seven-colored divine light.</p><p></p><p>He just put it away to give to his true self later.</p><p></p><p>Coming back to his senses, he looked at Zhong Shentong, who was still in shock, and asked in puzzlement, "What? Is it very difficult to fish up this golden light sphere? Fellow Daoist Zhong, you have occupied this fishing platform for several decades. With your ability, you should have fished up quite a few. Is there a need to be so surprised?"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong opened his mouth, wanting to say something but stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Heh... heh..."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong's eyes were full of confusion, and he could only respond with a dry laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, luck is conserved. The things fished up this time are not bad. If you don't know how to restrain yourself, you'll probably be wasting your efforts for a long time to come."</p><p></p><p>"The affairs of the association are numerous, and I can't always stay here," Ji Shaoli said with some reluctance.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, some geniuses from the association may come to fish from time to time in the future. Before they come, I will notify you." He threw a communication talisman to the other party, and Ji Shaoli once again looked at the fishing pool with reluctance.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he called out to Lin Ling and left the small mountain temple.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong looked at the familiar scenery inside the small temple, which couldn't be more familiar, only with an added layer of protective formation.</p><p></p><p>The experience during this period was like a dream.</p><p></p><p>It made him feel a little confused.</p><p></p><p>However, that faceless stone statue suddenly appeared before his eyes, instantly waking Zhong Shentong up.</p><p></p><p>After much thought, he sighed slightly, helplessly accepting the situation.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This fact.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at the fishing pond and stubbornly sat back down, unwilling to accept defeat.</p><p></p><p>Even if he had used up all his fishing attempts for the day, he still wanted to get a feel for it.</p><p></p><p>Even if Ji Shaoli surpassed him in terms of cultivation, realm, and divine powers, Zhong Shentong would not feel upset.</p><p></p><p>The only thing Zhong Shentong couldn't accept was that in such a short time, Ji Shaoli had fished out the golden light ball that he himself had only caught twice in his entire life.</p><p></p><p>"In the way of fishing, I am definitely not inferior to others!"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong steeled his resolve, constantly practicing his rod-casting movements in his mind.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Above the small mountain temple.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli carefully monitored Zhong Shentong's life from the shadows for two or three days.</p><p></p><p>Discovering that apart from becoming increasingly obsessed with fishing, he had no other abnormal behavior, Ji Shaoli left with peace of mind.</p><p></p><p>"Relying solely on the reputation of the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal to deceive others is ultimately not a long-term plan."</p><p></p><p>"In order to ensure that the secrets here are not leaked, some other methods are still needed."</p><p></p><p>"Foundation Establishment cultivation is not enough to use the True Temptation Fruit. After this body completes its breakthrough, the [Blood Lineage Crossing] secret technique will suffice."</p><p></p><p>The endless treasure in the fishing pond was obviously not something that could be excavated in a short time.</p><p></p><p>So Ji Shaoli had no intention of staying here and fishing every day.</p><p></p><p>Relying on him alone, even if he fished for a hundred years, compared to that brilliant starry sky, it would only be a drop in the bucket. Moreover, fishing based on luck without knowing the specific situation of the treasures was too inefficient.</p><p></p><p>"Even if some supreme treasure is really fished out, there's no need to worry. In the end, it will all be mine."</p><p></p><p>While pondering, he personally went to the Lingmu Realm with Lin Ling and handed over the [Seven-Colored Jade Void Glazed Light] to his original body.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he return to Haixuan Island.</p><p></p><p>As usual, he checked the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>During the time he was focused on fishing, the Myriad Immortal Alliance was actually not peaceful either.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of the hundreds of candidates for the [Thirty-Three Immortals Selection] had already returned one after another.</p><p></p><p>Only thirty-three cultivators remained at the alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the selected immortals had been finalized!</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew that these selected immortals would definitely reach the Harmonious Dao realm in the future and had limitless prospects.</p><p></p><p>Their backgrounds and identities had long been thoroughly investigated.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was to curry favor or to establish good relations in advance, as long as they weren't foolish cultivators, they all began to think of ways to form connections with these thirty-three selected immortals.</p><p></p><p>As for Wei Qizheng, who had successfully been selected, although he was alone without family, there were still many cultivators who came from afar to contact Wei Qizheng's good friends.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the organization that Wei Qizheng had previously participated in, the Congyun Sea Mutual Aid Society, was also exposed to the public eye.</p><p></p><p>However, after some investigation, people discovered that the members of this mutual aid society were all cultivators within the alliance system, and none of them had deep foundations.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the highest cultivation among them was only at the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p></p><p>"They're just banding together for warmth."</p><p></p><p>This was the conclusion they couldn't help but reach.</p><p></p><p>They only sighed at the good luck of this small group. Despite their small numbers, they actually produced a selected immortal.</p><p></p><p>At first, when faced with the influx of inquiries, the members of the mutual aid society were a bit nervous.</p><p></p><p>However, after realizing that these so-called "major forces" cultivators didn't really pay much attention to them, and after just a few exchanges, the topic would always shift to Wei Qizheng, they gradually let go of their worries.</p><p></p><p>In fact, they didn't really have much to reveal anyway.</p>

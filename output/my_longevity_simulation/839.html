        <h1>Chapter 839</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Although the three of them had quickly left Qiling Prefecture with the help of the earth's veins, they could still feel the tremendous roar and tremor transmitted from the surging earth's veins.</p><p></p><p>It was like a huge wave hitting from behind. Even Lin Ling, who was protected by the power of the ancient earth vein tree, was forced to sway and directly deviate from the original direction.</p><p></p><p>One could imagine how terrifying the situation in Qiling Prefecture itself was.</p><p></p><p>Not only the neighboring prefectures, but even the distant Congyun Sea felt slight tremors. </p><p></p><p>On Haixuan Island, the Congyun Sea Mutual Aid Association, which already had eighteen cultivators, was originally enthusiastically discussing the future plans of the organization. But at this moment, they all fell silent in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at each other, feeling doubtful and alarmed.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Just now, it shouldn't have been my illusion, right?" He Zhenghao asked, looking a bit uncertain.</p><p></p><p>Fellow Daoist He is indeed a hero who knows the current affairs. Although he missed the opportunity to join the first time, as soon as he confirmed the news that Pei Tuo had successfully advanced to the Nascent Soul stage, he immediately visited Ji Shaoli again.</p><p></p><p>Even after being refused at the door for seven days, he still did not give up. Instead, he persistently kept sending messages, expressing his strong desire to join.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Ji Shaoli was moved by his sincerity. He Zhenghao thus became one of the eleven cultivators who joined the Congyun Sea Mutual Aid Association in the second batch.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli stroked his beard without speaking.</p><p></p><p>Pei Tuo, who had the highest cultivation among them, looked towards the direction of Qiling Prefecture with a solemn expression: "It's not an illusion. Even here, we can feel the earth slightly trembling. It seems that something big has happened."</p><p></p><p>"Terrible. Who knows how many cultivators will die tragically in this calamity."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the war has started again?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Everyone was discussing.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was still Ji Shaoli, who always paid attention to the movements of the Immortal Alliance, who read out the official announcement first.</p><p></p><p>"An earth tremor occurred in Qiling Prefecture, and cultivators who have attained the Dao have rushed to the scene at the first moment."</p><p></p><p>"The earth tremor has gradually subsided, and there have been no incidents of cultivator deaths so far."</p><p></p><p>"After preliminary investigation, the possibility of subsequent continued disasters has been ruled out."</p><p></p><p>"No need to be nervous..."</p><p></p><p>After Ji Shaoli slowly finished reading, he looked at everyone present: "Everyone, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Xiang Xin snorted coldly: "Such a huge disaster, and they say no cultivators have fallen. Who would believe that?"</p><p></p><p>"They are getting more and more outrageous, they can't even be bothered to make up lies anymore?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The reactions of the crowd were within Ji Shaoli's expectations.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that he and his companions were the culprits behind the earth tremor incident in Qiling Prefecture, he probably would never believe the absurd notion that such a terrifyingly scaled calamity would not result in cultivator casualties.</p><p></p><p>However, he had no intention of standing up to correct them.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli smiled slightly and said, "Alright, let's end the discussion on this matter here. It's fine to talk about it among ourselves, but when outside, it's best to keep it to ourselves. Otherwise, it's easy to bring unnecessary trouble."</p><p></p><p>No one present was a reckless youth. They immediately nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli also brought the conversation topic back to the main point.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that the organization doesn't trust everyone. It's just that this matter is of great importance. If there is even a slight leak, I'm afraid everyone present will find it difficult to escape death."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, I need you all to take an oath on the [Saving the Suffering and Difficulties, Red Dust..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Before the "Compassionate Immortal", a vow was made.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli placed a red contract, emanating an eerie aura, in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>Pei Tuo, without any hesitation, was the first to take the poisonous oath and carve his name on the contract.</p><p></p><p>The rest of them also followed suit one after another.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli nodded with satisfaction and put away the red contract.</p><p></p><p>He asked, "What do you all think about the upcoming Immortal Alliance's grand examination?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was slightly stunned, not knowing what Ji Shaoli meant for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Because everyone present had already taken up positions within the Immortal Alliance system.</p><p></p><p>Although this grand examination was on a large scale and expanded recruitment for half of the positions, it had nothing to do with this group of people.</p><p></p><p>Unless...</p><p></p><p>They now resign from their current positions and re-apply as new candidates.</p><p></p><p>It's not that this kind of thing hasn't happened before.</p><p></p><p>Only those who are very dissatisfied with their current positions and see no hope for promotion for a long time, yet have great ambitions, would do so.</p><p></p><p>After all, the grand examination is not easy. Who can guarantee that they will successfully re-enter after resigning from their original positions?</p><p></p><p>If they fail to successfully re-enter, they may have to consider fleeing far away to take refuge.</p><p></p><p>Without absolute confidence, almost no one would choose this action that is like a warrior cutting off his own wrist.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that everyone at the scene remained silent, Ji Shaoli did not explain for now.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he distributed jade slips to each person.</p><p></p><p>After examining them, everyone frowned.</p><p></p><p>They could naturally see that the content in the jade slips was the format of the grand examination questions.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Ji Shaoli's mysterious actions before and the terrifying background of the mutual aid society that was hidden deeply, a guess couldn't help but appear in everyone's minds.</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible?"</p><p></p><p>Soon, they all secretly shook their heads, rejecting it themselves.</p><p></p><p>The questions for the Immortal Alliance's entry examination were the most confidential secrets.</p><p></p><p>Even though they secretly complained from time to time that the Immortal Alliance was corrupt, in so many years, they had never heard of any leakage of the grand examination questions.</p><p></p><p>Although there must be a great power supporting the mutual aid society behind the scenes, but...</p><p></p><p>The scene was dead silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>It was still Ji Shaoli who spoke up, confirming the guess that they didn't even dare to think about.</p><p></p><p>"If nothing unexpected happens, the content of the questions for this grand examination should all be in these jade slips."</p><p></p><p>His words were very light.</p><p></p><p>But when they fell on everyone's ears, it was no less than a thunderclap.</p><p></p><p>On the spot, quite a few cultivators directly stood up, looking at Ji Shaoli with their eyes wide open and tongues tied.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Ji, is this true?"</p><p></p><p>"When have I ever lied to you?" Ji Shaoli cut him off.</p><p></p><p>After being silent for a moment, giving everyone time to slowly accept the huge shock, Ji Shaoli looked at He Zhenghao and the others, with various expressions on their faces, and spoke again, "Although with the support of the organization, everyone's strength will inevitably make leaps and bounds in a short period of time, it is still somewhat difficult to get promoted."</p><p></p><p>"After all, those willing to join our mutual aid society won't have any strong background."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, Congyun Sea is a remote place and cannot be compared to the prosperous states in the central Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Ji Shaoli explained the reasons for helping everyone, he asked, "The real questions for the grand examination are here. I wonder, which fellow Daoists are willing to risk it all?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out, the scene immediately fell into a dead silence.</p><p></p><p>From the expressions on everyone's faces, one could see the struggle in their hearts.</p>

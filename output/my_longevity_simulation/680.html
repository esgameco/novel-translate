            <p>"I also heard about it, that guy doesn't seem to have a high cultivation level of Qi refining. Do you think it's possible? Surely he must have been infiltrated by thieves into the sect. I think he's up to no good."</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up, we might miss the competition."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Amidst the bustling voices, Li Fan followed the crowd and arrived at a martial arts arena.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also understood the information about this body.</p><p></p><p>Ji Zhaoxuan, Golden Core cultivation, inner disciple of the Heavenly Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>He was silent and introverted, not fond of socializing, entirely immersed in the way of the sword.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother Chen, I give in!"</p><p></p><p>A pleasant voice made Li Fan's body tremble, instantly coming back to his senses.</p><p></p><p>Because the owner of this voice was too familiar to Li Fan, it was Mr. Bai!</p><p></p><p>Following the direction from where the voice came, Li Fan realized that the cultivator speaking had an ordinary appearance, completely different from Mr. Bai. However, the aura he inadvertently revealed made Li Fan sure that he was indeed Mr. Bai himself!</p><p></p><p>"He probably changed his appearance because his original appearance attracted too much attention."</p><p></p><p>"But, what time is it now? Why did he pretend to be an ordinary person and join the Heavenly Sword Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was filled with numerous doubts.</p><p></p><p>With questions in mind, Li Fan continued to look towards the arena.</p><p></p><p>After the Golden Core cultivator surnamed Chen was defeated by Mr. Bai, who appeared to have a lower cultivation level on the surface, he didn't show a very unacceptable expression. Instead, he bowed respectfully and said, "Thank you for your guidance, senior."</p><p></p><p>Then, with a hint of joy, he passed by the crowd, disappeared, and went into seclusion for introspection.</p><p></p><p>The observing cultivators were in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>They all understood that this "Qi refining" cultivator was definitely not as simple as he appeared.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan finally discovered something.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was fixed on the wooden sword held by Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>"This sword..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was instantly shaken.</p><p></p><p>He quickly inquired with his fellow disciples nearby and learned that Mr. Bai didn't have a suitable weapon in his hands when the competition started. He casually picked up a piece from the nearby trees and crafted this wooden sword.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this fact, Li Fan was once again shocked.</p><p></p><p>"No mistake, this wooden sword is the same as the one in the hands of Sun Feng in the future."</p><p></p><p>"The wonder of the heavens, [Sword]!"</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible? Such a remarkable item was casually created by Mr. Bai?"</p><p></p><p>"What level of cultivation does he have?"</p><p></p><p>This discovery temporarily threw Li Fan's thoughts into chaos.</p><p></p><p>The wonder of the heavens [Sword] is the convergence of the principles of the sword in the world.</p><p></p><p>Normally, it can only be nurtured with the help of the wonders of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>But now, in the hands of Mr. Bai, it was simply created as if it were a child's toy.</p><p></p><p>So how deep is Mr. Bai's understanding of swordsmanship, and even the principles of heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>This was beyond Li Fan's imagination.</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was almost dazed, another Nascent Soul sword cultivator used sword energy to attack, sending forth a set of forty-nine subordinate swords like a downpour of pear blossoms towards Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai lifted his hand and made a light swing with his sword.</p><p></p><p>The forty-nine subordinate swords instantly turned against their master, chaotic and disorganized.</p><p></p><p>But in a blink of an eye, the sword cultivator had already been defeated.</p><p></p><p>"Did you guys notice that he's even stronger now than when he fought Elder Brother Chen!"</p><p></p><p>"He must be hiding his cultivation to toy with us!"</p><p></p><p>"Now Senior Brother must step in; I wonder if he's sober now."</p><p></p><p>Amidst the discussions of the crowd, memories of the Heavenly Sword Sect's Senior Brother surfaced in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>The ten-thousand-year senior disciple of the Heavenly Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>In reality, his seniority surpassed even the current sect leader.</p><p></p><p>Named: Situ Yao.</p><p></p><p>Back then, Senior Brother Situ Yao was known as the number one martial power in the world. This attracted many bellicose cultivators who came to challenge him.</p><p></p><p>Fed up with this, Situ Yao somehow brought two large stones and placed them at the sect gate. He then used his sword to carve the words "Those who come in peace, stop here" and "Those who come with aggression, lay down your arms."</p><p></p><p>It was said that after carving the words, Situ Yao immediately drank a jug of good wine, laughed heartily, and said he would be peaceful from then on.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, after that, the vast majority of challengers couldn't even surpass the restrictions of the two large stones at the sect gate.</p><p></p><p>Realizing the immense power gap between them, they could only leave in disarray.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Situ Yao is also an extraordinary figure."</p><p></p><p>Years later, Li Fan, who had seen the stones that had now turned into natural anomalies, couldn't help but think this.</p><p></p><p>"However, obviously, he still has a considerable gap compared to Mr. Bai."</p><p></p><p>"One is just a marvel among men, while the other has reached the realm of marvel among the heavens..."</p><p></p><p>"It's truly unimaginable."</p><p></p><p>The legendary nature of Situ Yao further veiled Mr. Bai in mystery.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, facing the challenges from the disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect, he, whose strength was unfathomable, welcomed them without rejection.</p><p></p><p>He defeated them all with just one move.</p><p></p><p>The defeated disciples of the Heavenly Sword Sect were not frustrated; instead, each of them was very pleased, seeming to have gained a lot from this "spar."</p><p></p><p>Understanding that this was a rare opportunity, the disciples eagerly lined up for their turn.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan seized this opportunity amidst the eager disciples and stood before Mr. Bai before anyone else.</p><p></p><p>Even though one could view the beings of the Xuanhuang realm as inconsequential, Li Fan's heart couldn't help but feel a bit nervous in front of this extremely mysterious Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>Because this time entering the realm of the meteoric immortal was in possession mode, he couldn't use his own divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Li Fan recalled the cultivation technique Ji Zhaoxuan practiced in possession.</p><p></p><p>It was a rare method of condensing Qi into a sword.</p><p></p><p>However, one method encompasses all methods.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the Qi sword, he was able to unleash a part of the power of the divine ability Li Fan comprehended, the [Breaking Heaven Heart Sword].</p><p></p><p>"Please enlighten me, sir."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, as his thoughts turned, several sword intents filled with black demonic energy suddenly appeared beside Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>The black sword let out a long howl, as if it wanted to cut Mr. Bai into countless pieces.</p><p></p><p>"Good idea, but is your heart truly in line with the sword?"</p><p></p><p>Just as the black sword was about to strike Mr. Bai, it suddenly halted in midair.</p><p></p><p>Time seemed to freeze for some reason.</p><p></p><p>Faintly, Li Fan heard the pleasant words of Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>"Treat the sword as a tool, and the sword will treat you as a tool as well."</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>As if a thunderbolt had shattered the mist, numerous inspirations flashed in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Countless possibilities of the Breaking Heaven Heart Sword suddenly appeared before Li Fan.</p>

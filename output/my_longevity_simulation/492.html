            <p>If we were truly extremely evil, how could we withstand the attack of the Wanxian Alliance in the thousand-year struggle without being defeated?</p><p></p><p>The scholar asked again loudly. New 69 Book Bar â†’ 69shu.com</p><p></p><p>Among the cultivators of the Wanxian Alliance, many showed a pensive expression upon hearing this statement.</p><p></p><p>But many others looked confused, as if their values had been greatly challenged.</p><p></p><p>Well then, let me introduce to you the current situation of the Five Elders' Association.</p><p></p><p>The scholar's huge figure stood tall in the world, filling everyone's field of vision as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>The territory of the Five Elders' Association is divided into five parts.</p><p></p><p>Five heavenly lords rule each separately.</p><p></p><p>As for the territories of the other heavenly lords, I am not at liberty to comment. If you have the opportunity in the future, you can explore them for yourself.</p><p></p><p>Let's talk about the realm you are currently in, the "Human Dao Realm".</p><p></p><p>The scholar's words attracted the attention of all the cultivators present, including Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The five heavenly lords each go against the principles of heaven and earth, creating unique regions.</p><p></p><p>In our "Human Dao Realm", the most important principle is the Doctrine of the Heavenly Lords.</p><p></p><p>It is also the law of heaven and earth, which everyone must follow, and no one can violate.</p><p></p><p>The scholar paused and explained the origin of the name of the "Human Dao Realm".</p><p></p><p>Compared to humans and the heavens and earth, we are but insignificant beings.</p><p></p><p>Both our bodies and names will perish, but the rivers will flow for eternity. New 69 Book Bar 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Even for cultivators who can overturn rivers and seas, seemingly changing the shape of heaven and earth. Yet, the rivers will return, and after the cultivator's death, everything will be in vain. All past events will be like a mirage, no longer existing.</p><p></p><p>Only the Eternal Heavenly Lords, who defy the principles of heaven and earth, can truly change the order of heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>Why is it that only the Eternal Heavenly Lords can perform such extraordinary feats?</p><p></p><p>In our "Human Dao Realm", changing the order of heaven and earth is achievable by all!</p><p></p><p>The scholar declared loudly.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing these words, although everyone felt a sense of pride, they also had many questions.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators, boldly speaking up, asked: Sir, if everyone can change the order of heaven and earth, how can this be done?</p><p></p><p>The scholar smiled faintly: When you came, did you see the brilliant stars in the sky?</p><p></p><p>Everyone nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>In fact, those stars were not real stars but were once cultivators. The scholar's words echoed like thunder throughout the world.</p><p></p><p>With a sweep of his hand, the once bright sky darkened instantly.</p><p></p><p>The darkness lasted only a moment before being illuminated by countless stars again.</p><p></p><p>In the Human Dao Realm, regardless of one's cultivation level, as long as there is enough faith and courage, one can transform into stars and ascend to the sky.</p><p></p><p>While shining eternally upon the world, one can also change the original shape of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Long ago, in the Human Dao Realm, there was a young man born between two mountains. New 69 Book Bar 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>The scholar began to tell a story.</p><p></p><p>The mountains obstructed passage, making it extremely inconvenient. The villagers in the mountains were very poor. Seeing this situation, the young man made a grand vow from a young age to completely remove these two mountains to seek a way out for his family.</p><p></p><p>Remote in the mountains and rarely visited, the young man was unaware of immortals and attempted to dig through with human strength alone.</p><p></p><p>Despite facing misunderstandings and ridicule, he remained unwavering and never regretted his decision.</p><p></p><p>With sincere effort, even stone can be split. After a hundred years, when the young man became an old man on the verge of death, he still held firm to his determination.</p><p></p><p>After his death, he transformed into a star and ascended into the sky. Under the radiance of the stars, the two mountains disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>This is an example of an ordinary mortal body changing the order of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>If mortals can do this, what about cultivators? In the Human Dao Realm, there are countless examples of changing the order of heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan's puppet body was immersed in the scholar's narration, his main body had already passed through the transmission array and arrived at Shilin State.</p><p></p><p>Wanxian Island had been abducted, and all teleportation nodes leading to the Misty Cloud Sea had already malfunctioned.</p><p></p><p>He could only make do and make his way through the transmission array to the neighboring Shilin State first.</p><p></p><p>As he attempted to fly into the Misty Cloud Sea, Li Fan suddenly discovered that an invisible barrier enveloped the entire Misty Cloud Sea.</p><p></p><p>It was sealed off, preventing outsiders from entering.</p><p></p><p>It seemed they had finally reacted and imposed martial law. Li Fan squinted his eyes and decided not to force his way in.</p><p></p><p>Instead, his main body returned to the nearby Immortal City, shifting focus to his clone Zhou Qing'ang.</p><p></p><p>On the way, he could see many anxious cultivators, unaware of what had happened, rushing towards Wanxian Island.</p><p></p><p>Losing the teleportation array made them realize the value of being able to travel instantly.</p><p></p><p>It took his clone more than ten days to reach the destination.</p><p></p><p>A large group of cultivators had already gathered here, whispering and discussing among themselves.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the crowd was a huge black hole.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding seawater seemed to be hindered by some force, unable to flow into the black hole.</p><p></p><p>In the azure sea, the existence of this black hole looked so eerie and out of place.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing this, Li Fan furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>This appearance, why does it seem so similar to when I first witnessed the burning of the Sea of Crimson Flames?</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>A speculation involuntarily arose in his mind, causing Li Fan to freeze momentarily.</p><p></p><p>Having witnessed the disappearance of Wanxian Island and the indelible intense energy around the void later on.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, witnessing the Crimson Flames that stood in the air, holding flames and roasting the Misty Cloud Sea.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan instinctively thought that Crimson Flames had intervened and completely destroyed Wanxian Island.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, it seemed very similar.</p><p></p><p>But since he didn't witness the destruction of Wanxian Island with his own eyes, there existed a second possibility in reality.</p><p></p><p>That is, Wanxian Island, like this world, had been completely evacuated by some means.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, after the extermination of Crimson Flames, which led to the appearance of Mo Sha in this world afterward.</p><p></p><p>He ultimately did not witness the destruction of Wanxian Island.</p><p></p><p>Because before Wanxian Island disappeared completely, he was already devoured by those black particles.</p><p></p><p>Thinking back on the various secrets he had perused, none of them mentioned this aspect.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan began to doubt his own judgment.</p><p></p><p>This doesn't make sense either, right? If Wanxian Island really had something hidden, the Wanxian Alliance should be well aware. It should be strictly guarded, so how could the Five Elders' Association easily abduct it?</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was lost in thought, he heard a cultivator among the onlookers sigh and say, "The world is truly unpredictable. I never thought that the original preaching site of the Transmission Heavenly Lord would one day disappear."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>He quickly approached and greeted the cultivator.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Although the pond seemed to have nothing mysterious about it, Stone Slab's instincts told him that there should be some secret hidden here.</p><p></p><p>Stone Slab slowly walked to the edge of the pond, and the clear pool water reflected the appearance of the scholar, which made him slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Then he shook his head, but in an instant, he changed his appearance.</p><p></p><p>"I'm a bit curious about what you originally looked like," said Faceless Holy Emperor Li Ping behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I myself can't quite remember," Stone Slab laughed self-deprecatingly.</p><p></p><p>Then he began to carefully observe the pond.</p><p></p><p>The water was not deep, and at a glance, everything could be seen.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Stone Slab observed for a long time but couldn't find the mystery of the pond, and he couldn't help but start to doubt his judgment.</p><p></p><p>He turned to look at Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Ping did not explain for him but suddenly asked pointedly, "Before the great calamity in the Xuanhuang Realm, there were many immortal treasures in the world. Now, after more than ten thousand years, these treasures have long been lost. The existence of immortal tools has also become a legend, and even cultivators rarely mention them in casual conversations."</p><p></p><p>"Does Fellow Daoist know the whereabouts of these immortal treasures?"</p><p></p><p>Stone Slab's expression remained unchanged: "Immortal tools? I've never been concerned about..."</p><p></p><p>Halfway through his words, he seemed to realize something and looked at the fishing pond again.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, his appearance changed again.</p><p></p><p>A fisherman in a straw raincoat, carrying a fish basket, instantly appeared in front of Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>With a flash of green light in his hand, Stone Slab, in the form of a fisherman, cast his fishing rod.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, his body suddenly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>Without reeling in the rod, Stone Slab stood still, as if frozen.</p><p></p><p>A long time later, he took a step back and emerged from the illusion before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What was that?" Stone Slab stared straight at Li Ping.</p><p></p><p>"What was what?" the Holy Emperor asked knowingly.</p><p></p><p>"The fish pond? The starry sky?" Stone Slab continued to press.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping shook his head slightly: "That was the [bait]."</p><p></p><p>"Bait?" Stone Slab was inexplicably stunned.</p><p></p><p>"The angler is also the one being fished," Li Ping said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Even if Fellow Daoist sees the treasures of the entire starry sky and remains unmoved, what if it involves your path to liberation? Can you still be so calm?" Li Ping's tone was ethereal.</p><p></p><p>Stone Slab had lived in the Xuanhuang Realm for too long and had seen too many things.</p><p></p><p>So after hearing Li Ping's words and pondering for a moment, he quickly understood his meaning.</p><p></p><p>"With the immortal path severed, the starry sea outside Xuanhuang should have long been a wasteland. Unless..." A flash of realization appeared in Stone Slab's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Stone Slab denied: "Things under heaven are more or less the same. Even if it's another world, what difference does it make? I just want to take off the heavy stone slab on my back and have a good sleep."</p><p></p><p>He brought the topic back to the fishing pond: "I'm not sure when this thing came to the Xuanhuang Realm. But it can be certain that it was after the great calamity."</p><p></p><p>"More precisely, it was after the Dharma transmission reappeared and the Myriad Immortals Alliance was established."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor put it more clearly: "In other words, this fishing pond was most likely planted into the Xuanhuang Realm along with the remnants of other cultivation realms."</p><p></p><p>"It should be so... but the treasures of the immortal way have already transcended our understanding. It can't be guaranteed," Stone Slab said, leaving room for doubt.</p><p></p><p>"The path to liberation you mentioned, could it be to let me take this bait?" Stone Slab looked at the Holy Emperor with a somewhat strange expression.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping said frankly, "That's right. Doesn't Fellow Daoist feel extremely painful? You have merged with the Creation Stone Slab, and I think only an immortal treasure that surpasses the power limit of the cultivation realm can separate you from the stone slab."</p><p></p><p>"As for what fate awaits after being fished away by the power behind the fishing pond, that's not something I can guarantee."</p><p></p><p>Stone Slab really wanted to say that he had no grudges or enmity with Fellow Daoist, so why harm him?</p><p></p><p>But the words reached his mouth and stopped again.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, this Faceless Venerable had no ill intentions. Otherwise, he wouldn't have directly revealed the entire plan.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, Stone Slab felt that the person in front of him was quite honest.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a kind of familiar aura from the other party's body made him inexplicably feel somewhat at ease.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just too tired of living and want to get rid of this burden. It's not that I don't want to live anymore," Stone Slab politely declined the Holy Emperor's kind intentions.</p><p></p><p>"If Fellow Daoist is only troubled by the information constantly emerging from the Creation Stone Slab, then it's easier to handle," Li Ping finally revealed his true intentions.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" There was obvious doubt in Stone Slab's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Does Fellow Daoist recognize this object?" Li Ping stretched out his hand, and a brilliant blue crystal floated quietly in his palm.</p><p></p><p>"The Transmutation Stone, I do know of it. You want to..." Stone Slab shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"To be honest with Fellow Daoist, in order to alleviate the pain, I have also tried various methods. I have also tried the secret technique of the Transmutation Divine One from the Taiyi Sect. But the Creation Stone Slab is the embodiment of the authority of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao. The Heavenly Dao is high above, despising all things. After merging with me, it can no longer accommodate anything else..."</p><p></p><p>"That was before. The present is different from the past," Li Ping directly interrupted Stone Slab's words.</p><p></p><p>Stone Slab was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Besides, I can also help you."</p><p></p><p>With these words, the aura on the Faceless Holy Emperor changed.</p><p></p><p>Above the Daoist temple, the wind and clouds gathered. A strange rhythm appeared out of thin air, echoing with the Holy Emperor from afar.</p><p></p><p>"You are?!"</p><p></p><p>Even though he had lived for tens of thousands of years, he still couldn't help but exclaim in shock at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerable?!"</p><p></p><p>But he quickly denied it himself: "No, that's impossible. And..."</p><p></p><p>Stone Slab looked up and gazed at the sky. His expression changed from shock to solemnity.</p><p></p><p>The authority wielded by the Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerable was independent of the Creation Stone Slab and above it.</p><p></p><p>Although the Stone Slab still had records of his deeds, they were just a few brief strokes, only giving the vaguest outline.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Stone Slab sensed that the aura on the Faceless Holy Emperor was clearly different from the Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerable described in the records.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerable presides over the Heavenly Dao of Kun. Although he has countless connections with the Heavenly Dao, he is more like an independent individual. But with a certain blessing, he can manipulate the laws of the Heavenly Dao as easily as moving his arms. And this person in front of me..."</p><p></p><p>An idea inexplicably arose in Stone Slab's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Embodiment of the Heavenly Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Although it seemed a bit incredible, this was the most reasonable explanation.</p><p></p><p>And Li Ping also seemed to sense Stone Slab's thoughts. He no longer demonstrated his connection with the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Nor did he directly explain.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he brought the topic back to before: "With the help of the Transmutation Stone to share and sort out what's happening in the Xuanhuang Realm, it should make things easier for you."</p><p></p><p>"But the Transmutation Stone alone is not enough."</p><p></p><p>Stone Slab's eyes slightly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Waiting for the other party's next words.</p><p></p><p>"Duyue Sect, fellow Daoist, you should be familiar with it, right?" Li Ping asked.</p><p></p><p>Hearing these three words, the expression on the stone tablet's face became slightly unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>"The Observing World Divine Eye of the Duyue Sect has a similar effect to the Creation Stone Tablet. Coupled with the endless paper men and that Book of Transcending Calamity, it can also record everything that is monitored."</p><p></p><p>"The Book of Transcending Calamity, plus the Dao Transformation Stone. It should be enough to offset the side effects of the Creation Stone Tablet. As for the rest, I think with fellow Daoist's tenacious will cultivated over tens of thousands of years, it shouldn't be a big problem to deal with." The Faceless Sacred Emperor said slowly.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet fell silent, pondering the feasibility of the other party's suggestion in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"First, the quality of this Dao Transformation Stone in fellow Daoist's hand is a bit insufficient..." After a moment, the stone tablet spoke.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet paused, then continued, "Second, the Duyue Sect angered the Dharma Transmission back then, and the entire sect was sealed and hidden away, whereabouts unknown. Because of the cultivation method they practice, [Eternal Calamity World], they can even interfere with the perception of heaven and earth. Moreover, it was the Dharma Transmission who took action, so..."</p><p></p><p>"I know where they are hiding." The Sacred Emperor said lightly. </p><p></p><p>The stone tablet was stunned by this.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that this person is even stronger than I imagined."</p><p></p><p>Now that the other party had said this much, the stone tablet naturally wouldn't be coy anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Please lend me a hand, fellow Daoist." He said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>This was the sentence Li Ping had been waiting for.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me."</p><p></p><p>His figure flickered and disappeared, instantly appearing on the horizon.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet followed in one step.</p><p></p><p>Only Ou Shangtian was left behind, looking completely bewildered. </p><p></p><p>He did not hear the conversation between the Sacred Emperor and the stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Li Ping pointed to the fishing pond, Ou Shangtian had lost his perception of these two powerful figures.</p><p></p><p>Until this moment, when they left one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't Master going to deal with that stone tablet? Why didn't they fight?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that it also joined our Sacred Dynasty, just like that ancient tree of the earth veins?"</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian suddenly had a bad premonition in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Ping and the stone tablet had already arrived outside the Duyue Sect, at the seal of the Dharma Transmission.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Ping skillfully dissolve the seal of the Dharma Transmission, the doubts in the stone tablet's mind grew.</p><p></p><p>"This is the seal left by the Dharma Transmission. Even for an incarnation of the Dao of Heaven, it shouldn't be so easy to break, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Or could it be that after so many years, the Profound Yellow Dao of Heaven has recovered to the point where it can contend with the Dharma Transmission?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping didn't care what the stone tablet thought and led him all the way into the Duyue Sect.</p><p></p><p>Up the mountain, down the mountain, endless repeating courtyards...</p><p></p><p>They all changed rapidly before him, and finally, the main hall of the Duyue Sect appeared in front of the two.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet followed him in and only then confirmed that this was indeed where the Duyue Sect used to be.</p><p></p><p>He could feel that in this gloomy main hall, countless paper men in a state between life and death were hidden.</p><p></p><p>"They are one of the ten immortal sects of the Profound Yellow Realm and enjoy the cultivation resources produced by the Profound Yellow Realm. Yet when the calamity struck, they chose to avoid the world and escape the disaster. They are truly pests of the Profound Yellow Realm, just like those so-called Observing World Divine Eyes." Li Ping's words were ice-cold and relentlessly critical.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet narrowed his eyes, neither agreeing nor disagreeing.</p><p></p><p>"Eternal Calamity World, using the calamities of the world to cultivate. This is a cultivation method that brings disaster to heaven and earth to begin with. If the world was thriving and there were no calamities, I'm afraid these people would have to create trouble and generate calamities. Such a sect should have been exterminated long ago." Li Ping continued.</p><p></p><p>As if hearing the Sacred Emperor's words, a cold wind suddenly blew in the gloomy main hall for no reason.</p><p></p><p>"Thinking that by turning into paper men, they can escape everything..."</p><p></p><p>A golden chain emerged from within the Sacred Emperor's body.</p><p></p><p>Silently, it suddenly shot into the dark depths of the main hall.</p><p></p><p>Like fog being stirred, the blackness inside the Duyue Sect's main hall also undulated like water ripples.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet observed that golden chain, a hint of surprise flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Then, from within Li Ping's body, a golden vortex phantom seemed to slowly emerge.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of chains, following the direction of the vortex's rotation, flew out with a howl.</p><p></p><p>Bang, bang...</p><p></p><p>Flying into the darkness, it seemed to collide with something, constantly making muffled sounds.</p><p></p><p>The momentum from the Sacred Emperor's body was so powerful that even the stone tablet had to take a step back temporarily.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet couldn't help but be shocked in his heart: "The strength of this person is quite a bit stronger than the ordinary meaning of [Longevity Realm]."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems to be more than just the power of the Profound Yellow Dao of Heaven."</p><p></p><p>Creaking sounds echoed throughout the main hall.</p><p></p><p>As the golden vortex galaxy within the Sacred Emperor's body reversed, the golden chains contracted.</p><p></p><p>It was as if something in the darkness was bound by the chains and forcibly dragged out.</p><p></p><p>If an ordinary cultivator saw this scene, they would definitely feel their hair stand on end.</p><p></p><p>However, the stone tablet's heart was a bit excited, which was rare.</p><p></p><p>It's these guys!</p><p></p><p>The paper men bared their teeth and claws, still wanting to struggle.</p><p></p><p>The end of the chain binding them burst with dazzling light, and the paper men instantly wilted as if struck by lightning.</p><p></p><p>Fear, accompanied by listlessness, it was quite strange that several different expressions could appear on the hollow paper faces.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping reached out and fiercely grasped the paper man in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Beside the Sacred Emperor, thousands of golden chains danced incessantly, dragging more and more paper men out of the darkness.</p><p></p><p>The main hall began to shake unstably, and even the entire Duyue Mountain seemed to be on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping stomped his foot hard, and a golden light halo spread out from under his feet to the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The space that was originally about to shatter froze and became still, as if frozen.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping lowered his head, his faceless gaze locking onto the paper man in his hand.</p><p></p><p>With a slight exertion of force, a wail suddenly came from the paper man in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, be gentle, be gentle..."</p><p></p><p>"We have no grievances or enmity, why are you being so ruthless!"</p><p></p><p>The paper man stopped playing dead and hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist? You're not qualified!" Li Ping's tone was full of disdain, and he exerted a bit more force with his hand.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the thousands of golden chains beside him also simultaneously emitted a dazzling light.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall, the painful cries of the paper men immediately rose one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable one, spare our lives, spare our lives!"</p><p></p><p>The situation was stronger than the individual, and the paper men finally stopped being stubborn and pleaded for mercy.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Ping did not stop immediately.</p><p></p><p>The vortex galaxy kept rotating, retracting the chains.</p><p></p><p>He gathered all the paper men of the Duyue Sect in one place before stopping the torment.</p><p></p><p>"This is the ancient and famous Duyue Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping looked at the pile of paper men in front of him and said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"We don't deserve to be called famous, we don't..."</p><p></p><p>"It's just for the sake of survival."</p>

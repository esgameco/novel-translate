            <p>Even for such characters, it took three times before they could adapt to the changes brought about by the differences between ancient times and the present?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan observed all of this and pondered.</p><p></p><p>"I will take this Longevity Pill to Friend Zhou first to see how much it can be sold for. Old Liu, you continue to work hard and quickly refine all the raw materials in the storage ring into pills," Li Fan said to Liusan.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, rest assured!" Liusan nodded naturally and, after letting the disciples rest for a while, started the pill refining process again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took out the freshly-made Longevity Pill from the Mysterious Yellow Cauldron and tossed it in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"It's not convenient to use the identity of 'Li Fan, a cultivator from the Tianji Sect' to sell it..." After pondering for a moment, Li Fan transformed back into his original appearance and headed to the Congyun City.</p><p></p><p>When he purchased the Tianling Flower before, Li Fan had used his original appearance to join the Wanxian Alliance through the Huang Ranqi, who guarded Chongwu Island, creating a new alias for himself.</p><p></p><p>Using the Hand Covers the Sky Secret Technique, he entered the Tianxuan Mirror and took out the Longevity Pill.</p><p></p><p>First, he let the mirror identify it for free.</p><p></p><p>"Longevity Pill: Low-grade, can extend lifespan by 186 years."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but feel a bit uneasy.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that even though Liusan had become familiar with the differences between the old and new, the quality of this first batch of pills was somewhat unsatisfactory. At the very least, it fell short of the promised medium-grade, extending lifespan by 300 years. Li Fan checked the previous market prices of longevity treasures, increased the price by thirty percent to fifty thousand contribution points, and put it up for sale.</p><p></p><p>In almost an instant, the Longevity Pill was bought by someone.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was initially stunned but then realized.</p><p></p><p>Longevity treasures were almost ineffective once consumed. Moreover, a Longevity Pill had never appeared in the market of the Wanxian Alliance before. This meant that for those cultivators in need, a Longevity Pill was practically a hundred years of real lifespan. Naturally, it was more valuable than other common longevity treasures.</p><p></p><p>And...</p><p></p><p>As expected by Li Fan, the buyer soon sent an inquiry.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, do you still have Longevity Pills?"</p><p></p><p>"I feel like this pill is different from other longevity treasures? It seems to have continued effects when taken again?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pretended to be somewhat surprised and replied, "Oh? Is that so? Did I sell it too cheaply then?"</p><p></p><p>The other party was not fooled by Li Fan's act and continued persistently, "Hehe, friend, don't joke around. The pill was obviously just refined recently, how could you not be aware of its characteristics?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to act foolishly, "Hehe, friend, you misunderstood. I just happened to come across it at a roadside stall and thought it was extraordinary. I didn't expect it to be a life-extending treasure."</p><p></p><p>"Well, if you still need it, I'll go back and check. I hope the vendor is still there."</p><p></p><p>The other side remained silent.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, still patiently, they said, "Alright, if there's stock in the future, you can come find me."</p><p></p><p>"Tianquan State, Zhao Tianlong!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't respond and directly hung up.</p><p></p><p>"The value of the Longevity Pill is beyond my previous estimates. Even if I rely solely on purchasing materials from the Tianxuan Mirror, I can still make a lot of profits."</p><p></p><p>"I just need to control the speed of sales to maximize profits."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, I can exchange goods and specify the resources needed."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan thought that not only could he sell through the Wanxian Alliance and the Ancient Society, but he might be able to open up more sales channels.</p><p></p><p>After all, a good thing like the 'True Fruit of Temptation' was definitely not something to be neglected.</p><p></p><p>If he could control one or two more cooperative cultivators, things would improve significantly in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait until there are more finished products."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan left the Congyun City with a pretense, just changing his identity back to being a cultivator from the Tianji Sect.</p><p></p><p>He contacted Ximen Yu in the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Ximen, how's the mission going?"</p><p></p><p>After a long time, a message came from the other side.</p><p></p><p>"Well, I've completed most of the analysis, but I've run into some trouble in a few locations."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? How so?" Li Fan asked with interest.</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yu first sent the locations where the comparison between ancient and modern times had been completed, and then said, "Qingniuling, Changsheng Valley, Fantianghe..."</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of how I compared them, I couldn't find any traces of these places in the present reality world."</p><p></p><p>"In my previous research, such situations have occurred, but the probability is very low."</p><p></p><p>"Your luck is really bad. I randomly selected several dozen places, and so many have completely disappeared," Ximen Yu complained.</p><p></p><p>"I estimate that it might be impossible to complete. I will return the extra contribution points to you," he sighed and said.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered slightly upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"Completely disappeared? Friend Ximen, do you know why?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>"There are many possibilities. One is earth-shattering changes, and these locations naturally disappear. The second is the existence of a White Mist Barrier. These ancient locations may happen to be inside the White Mist Barrier today, which is why they can't be found."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Ximen Yu fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong? Do you have something difficult to say?" Li Fan was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, but my speculation is a bit shocking and unsupported. It's better not to say it and make a fool of myself," Ximen Yu hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's interest was piqued by Ximen Yu's hesitation: "It's okay. Your knowledge is rare in this world. Speak out, and let me broaden my horizons."</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because Ximen Yu was rarely affirmed by others, he became somewhat excited upon hearing Li Fan's words.</p><p></p><p>He said, "You may find it unbelievable, but after comparing the ancient and modern landforms for many years, I discovered that a large part of the ancient areas on the Xuanhuang Realm's earth is missing."</p><p></p><p>"It's like a part has been taken away alive."</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yu's tone then became somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"In some places, it seems like they emerged out of thin air, as if the ancient immortal world didn't have such territories."</p><p></p><p>"So, overall, compared to ancient times, the Xuanhuang Realm has not shrunk but has instead expanded even more."</p><p></p><p>"It's truly strange and perplexing, making one wonder endlessly."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"Is your conclusion reliable?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course! There is a complete view of the ancient Xuanhuang Realm in the Meteorite Immortal Domain. Each time an ordinary cultivator enters, they can only glimpse a corner. I visited many cultivators and basically restored the original appearance of the ancient immortal world. The conclusion drawn from the comparison between ancient and modern times is just this!" Ximen Yu affirmed categorically.</p>

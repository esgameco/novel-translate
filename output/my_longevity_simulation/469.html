        <h1>Chapter 469</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>With the divine power protection of Tianyang, Li Fan was finally able to carefully inspect the gains from this trade with the Empire.</p><p></p><p>The detailed information of many exotic beasts and the frozen bodies of exotic beasts sealed in the Life-Sealing Treasure Box might not be very useful for other cultivators. However, for Li Fan, who practiced the "Furnace Manifestation Technique," it was an enormous treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could use the Furnace Manifestation Technique to transform and master all the peculiar abilities of the exotic beasts.</p><p></p><p>"The beauty of life, nothing surpasses this!"</p><p></p><p>"What is recorded in the Divine Medical Classic may not be the complete picture of all living beings in the world!"</p><p></p><p>With a light gesture, Li Fan took out all the bookworms from the storage ring.</p><p></p><p>His divine sense flickered through the books, and in an instant, numerous lights and shadows were projected onto the ceiling of the cave.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Stone in his mind emitted an unprecedented deep blue light, and Li Fan squinted his eyes, trying to record all the words and images he saw at the moment in his mind.</p><p></p><p>A tidal wave of information surged, separating, rearranging, and archiving in the Primordial Stone.</p><p></p><p>As pages turned with a whooshing sound, the lights and shadows kept changing.</p><p></p><p>After recording all the contents on several pages, Li Fan felt a slight throbbing in his temple.</p><p></p><p>Taking a short break, he took a Wudao Pill and resumed "reading."</p><p></p><p>Over thousands of years of evolution, the Empire gave birth to many unique species.</p><p></p><p>Most of them were unknown to Li Fan in the Divine Medical Classic and were non-existent in the current Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The various peculiar abilities of these creatures, even for the well-versed Li Fan, were astonishing.</p><p></p><p>For example, the "Intelligence Worm" that resided in the human brain and could help enhance cognitive abilities, the "Mimicking Beast" that could completely disguise itself after devouring another creature, and the "Thousand Spirits Bird" that fed on human emotions...</p><p></p><p>All these expanded Li Fan's horizons.</p><p></p><p>"The Furnace Manifestation Technique, this is the true myriad forms that all living beings should possess!"</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's marvel, the pages of the book kept turning.</p><p></p><p>The accumulation of the Empire over thousands of years was absorbed into Li Fan's knowledge in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Ten days later.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took a deep breath, pressed against his slightly aching forehead, and put the bookworms back into the storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Feeling Tianyang's concerned gaze, Li Fan waved his hand to indicate that he was fine.</p><p></p><p>After resting for half a day and restoring some energy, Li Fan took out the red wooden box again.</p><p></p><p>According to the information he had seen in the Tianxuan Mirror before, this Life-Sealing Treasure Box was a unique item of the Ancient Beast-taming Sect.</p><p></p><p>It was said to be made from the Sacred Spirit Wood and could seal and store living monsters.</p><p></p><p>With the passage of time, the Sacred Spirit Wood had nearly become extinct over thousands of years, and the Life-Sealing Treasure Box had become a rare item.</p><p></p><p>"It seems my intuition was correct."</p><p></p><p>"I felt a hint of familiarity from the woman in the green robe, probably from the Azure Phoenix he had encountered in the Immortal Falling Realm."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if the Red-Crowned Crane still exists."</p><p></p><p>"Does this mean that the creator of the Empire, the ancestor who first comprehended the 'Beast-Taming Method,' was Xu Ke?"</p><p></p><p>"In Li Chenfeng's memory, he had already passed away. However, things are not as simple as they seem on the surface."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>"Based on the information currently known, it seems that only Xu Ke from the Beast-taming Sect arrived in that small world, creating the inheritance of the current Empire."</p><p></p><p>"Where did the other members of the Beast-taming Sect go? What about Lu Ya?"</p><p></p><p>"Why did Emperor San Moh come to the Wanxian Alliance and become the curator of the Museum of Divine Treasures?"</p><p></p><p>All these doubts were temporarily unknown.</p><p></p><p>"The next trip to the Immortal Falling Realm should solve some of the mysteries."</p><p></p><p>"Soon." Li Fan calculated the time in his mind and thought.</p><p></p><p>After putting away the Life-Sealing Treasure Box, Li Fan took out a Beast Soul Bead of the Foundation-Building level.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that the Empire's generosity this time was beyond Li Fan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>With five hundred Foundation-Building cultivators, four hundred and ninety Golden Core cultivators, and nine Nascent Soul experts, if used properly, they would surely create a stir.</p><p></p><p>Although it was only theoretical combat power, the actual combat power of cultivators in the current Xuanhuang Realm was terrifyingly low.</p><p></p><p>Apart from a few cultivators who specialized in combat, most ordinary people could already perform a few attacks and survival spells skillfully.</p><p></p><p>The Beast Soul Armor, which could influence divine sense, resist most spell attacks, and was incredibly fast, was undoubtedly a powerful weapon for ordinary cultivators now.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan temporarily suppressed his thoughts, and with the Beast Soul Bead in his hand, he imprinted it on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, everything turned blood-red before him, and in a trance, Li Fan seemed to see a fierce one-eyed cheetah pouncing towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Li Fan's thoughts pierced towards the creature.</p><p></p><p>The cheetah let out a cry, and in an instant, the illusion disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The Beast Soul Bead dissolved into red liquid, seemingly lifelike, flowing from his eyebrows to his limbs.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sensed a special energy trying to infiltrate his body, attempting to modify his flesh.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the pure strengthening of internal hidden power using the Creation Furnace Technique, the Beast Soul Armor seemed to graft the power originally belonging to exotic beasts onto humans.</p><p></p><p>Although his abilities were temporarily enhanced, his body had now been tainted by the power of exotic beasts and was no longer pure.</p><p></p><p>"Unorthodox methods do not conform to the mainstream."</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, Li Fan's internal hidden power surged out like a flood, swiftly dispelling the invading power of the exotic beasts.</p><p></p><p>The cry of the cheetah echoed in his ears again, and the red liquid transformed from the Beast Soul Bead evaporated instantly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems this is only suitable for ordinary folks who cannot cultivate."</p><p></p><p>"Or perhapsâ€¦"</p><p></p><p>A strange glint passed through Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He remembered Ye Fei Peng from the previous life, who had awakened the bloodline of the Kunpeng.</p><p></p><p>"With a natural beast bloodline, one would no longer fear such contamination."</p><p></p><p>"This lifetime, He Zhenghao followed closely behind me, gaining more benefits, and probably won't be thinking about that illicit business anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Sister Su and the others are still in the Leijie. Without me, they probably wouldn't have had the opportunity to come here."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>"This life's drama cannot do without those little fellows."</p><p></p><p>Then, Li Fan got up, bid farewell to Tianyang, concealed his figure, and quietly came to the Leijie.</p><p></p><p>He went to the central volcano in the Leijie as usual, observing for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Strange..." Li Fan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He felt that the volcano was somewhat unusual when he first arrived in the Leijie. However, in subsequent visits, he had carefully investigated, but still couldn't figure out the reason.</p><p></p><p>As his cultivation grew deeper, his premonition only got stronger.</p><p></p><p>However, he still couldn't find the cause.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps after the Nascent Soul stage, I might discover something."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1329</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1318: Reverse Entropy Returns to Childhood</p><p></p><p>"Oh? I'd like to hear more details." Li Fan's expression turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist friend, can you see where the profound mystery lies in these ancient seal scripts?" Zhong Daoqing posed a riddle instead.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan traced with his fingers in the air: "The ancient meaning is 'past' or 'old'."</p><p></p><p>"...Time regression?" </p><p></p><p>Gazing at the mysterious character on the ruins, Li Fan savored it carefully, his eyes lighting up.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daoqing clapped in praise: "Your daoist insight is truly extraordinary! Even our senior Xianzhou would need several days to gain some understanding from this. Yet you were able to penetrate it with just a glance!"</p><p></p><p>"However, describing its power as time regression may not be quite accurate. It's more like things themselves reverting to their previous states..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly as the other explained.</p><p></p><p>"It sounds somewhat similar to the Qian Kun Ancient Hand of Ou Shangqian," he pondered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"When the ancient character was at full potency, anything within its sphere of influence would surely face catastrophic disaster. All things would devolve towards their previous forms. From life to death, reduced to dust. Truly making things ancient..." Zhong Daoqing waved his hand, projecting dozens of scenes before him.</p><p></p><p>As the ancient character emerged, cultivators, towering trees, the sprawling structures on the land, even the world itself, all reversed like rewinding time, devolving backwards through space-time. Eventually, they disintegrated into imperceptible particles scattered by the wind.</p><p></p><p>"If this true trace still retained some of its power, then no matter how tempting, even we in Xianzhou could only skirt around it, not daring to covet the slightest part of it. But now..."</p><p></p><p>Next, the Xianzhou cultivators demonstrated the wondrous application of this true immortal seal script.</p><p></p><p>The eldest among the elders, Xuandao Loujian, floated slowly towards the ancient character symbol.</p><p></p><p>He did not approach too closely, but rather hovered in the air.</p><p></p><p>As Zhong Daoqing said, the power of the ancient character had been depleted, relatively speaking. In fact, the true trace still retained a faint residual power. Compared to the character's full potency, it was almost negligible. However, just as the character itself - strong was harmful, weak was beneficial. When the reversing force of the ancient character was reduced to a suitable range...</p><p></p><p>The wrinkles on Xuandao's face gradually faded away. Amidst his white hair and brows, strands of black began to emerge. His body regained its upright stature, and even his spirit became more vigorous.</p><p></p><p>This scene was none other than a return to youth, a rejuvenation!</p><p></p><p>The Xianzhou elders were long accustomed to this, while Li Fan narrowed his eyes in contemplation.</p><p></p><p>He did not wait until Xuandao fully reversed back to his youthful period. After lingering within the range of the ancient character for just a few moments, Xuandao retreated gracefully.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan understood that this was to prevent himself from being affected too deeply by the ancient character.</p><p></p><p>After Xuandao, the other Xianzhou elders took turns circling the true trace character. They lingered for varying durations, all appearing much younger.</p><p></p><p>"With this character, wouldn't it mean eternal youth?" Li Fan marveled.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daoqing gave a wry smile: "It's not that simple. You can stay young, but not live forever..."</p><p></p><p>He shook his head: "Returning to youth through the ancient character does extend one's lifespan to an extent. But the more times it's used, the weaker the effect. Once the lifespan reaches its limit, it no longer increases."</p><p></p><p>"However, a youthful body is indeed far better than one nearing its end."</p><p></p><p>After the Xianzhou elders finished, Zhong Daoqing turned to Li Fan and asked, "Would the Daoist friend like to experience it as well?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan declined: "I'm only thirty years old, the prime of my physical condition. Reverting to childhood would do more harm than good."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he said this, a deathly silence fell over the tree space.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daoqing's expression became somewhat rigid: "The Daoist friend must be jesting?"</p><p></p><p>From Li Fan's personal strength, as well as his demonstrated mastery of formations and seal scripts, the Xianzhou cultivators had assumed he was a cultivator who had lived for hundreds or even thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Yet now Li Fan claimed to be only thirty years old?</p><p></p><p>How could the Xianzhou cultivators accept this!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chuckled: "I just learn things a bit faster. Though rare, there are still some in Greater Qi who are even more talented than me. No need to be so alarmed."</p><p></p><p>His words left the Xianzhou cultivators in disarray.</p><p></p><p>After joining forces to reseal the ancient character, they led Li Fan out of the tree's interior.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist friend, please rest here for now and do not leave. We still have some matters to discuss..."</p><p></p><p>At the peak of the Xianzhou space, in a pavilion atop what seemed like a mountain, Zhong Daoqing gave this instruction before hurriedly departing.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, and here are the three items you previously selected." Handing over a scroll of white paper, Zhong Daoqing rushed off.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the Xianzhou cultivators, Li Fan slowly unrolled the white paper, causing the three treasures to leap out and manifest before him.</p><p></p><p>He had already examined the bronze immortal crane and the seven-colored flowing light before.  With a wave of his hand, Li Fan put them away.</p><p></p><p>His attention then focused on the downcast clay figurine.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the faint tremors coming from Huanzhen, Li Fan's mind concentrated slightly.</p><p></p><p>Just like the previous two items, in an instant the figurine vanished into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>However, this time it was not stored away, but instead transformed into a mysterious energy absorbed by Huanzhen.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared intently at Huanzhen's interface.</p><p></p><p>It was as if faint currents of electricity flickered across, causing the characters on Huanzhen's interface to jump a few times.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it settled back to stillness.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze fell on the item that had changed before and after.</p><p></p><p>"Void Charging Progress: 400."</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" Li Fan's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why, ever since his rebirth, Li Fan had been waiting in the small world of Da Xuan for the charging to complete before venturing out.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the void charging progress limit was 200.</p><p></p><p>Having over 100 charging progress could help shield Li Fan from external attacks at critical moments, ensuring Huanzhen's successful activation.</p><p></p><p>However, as the enemies Li Fan provoked became increasingly powerful, this defensive function became somewhat inadequate.</p><p></p><p>The progress depleted too quickly, barely providing any protection.</p><p></p><p>But now, this figurine had directly doubled the charging limit.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Fan sensed that this additional 200 charging progress would not disappear with Huanzhen's reset if unused in this life.</p><p></p><p>Rather, it would persist within Huanzhen.</p><p></p><p>In other words, he could use this to undergo three consecutive rebirths.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled the appearance of the figurine in his mind: "The origins of this figurine seem to have..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit strange. Being able to supplement the 200 upper limit of energy, it must be an extraordinary object."</p><p></p><p>"It's just not known whether, if encountering this object again in the next life and absorbing it, the upper limit of energy can still be increased?"</p><p></p><p>So far, Li Fan still hadn't figured out the specific mechanism of the Primordial Truth energy.</p><p></p><p>The unknown medium needed to activate the Primordial Truth could only slowly increase through the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps by carefully studying this puppet, I can unveil this mystery," Li Fan narrowed his eyes and noted down this goal.</p><p></p><p>A 400 energy upper limit was like adding an extra layer of protection for Li Fan. More crucially, when encountering faceless immortals or even higher levels of existence, Li Fan could use consecutive Primordial Truths to try to escape their threat as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if there was only one Primordial Truth power, after returning to the predetermined anchor, he would still face a deadly crisis, which would be an extremely dangerous situation for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>From this perspective, the lifesaving significance of this puppet could not be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Ark is indeed my blessed land."</p><p></p><p>"In a moment, I can also ask them about the origins of this puppet," Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Zhong Daoqing led the elders back in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the previous discussion had reached some consensus, and the hostility and killing intent that Li Fan had vaguely sensed from some of them had completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Is the friend satisfied with this transaction?" Zhong Daoqing asked first.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, let me thank the friend first," Li Fan replied.</p><p></p><p>After the pleasantries, Zhong Daoqing changed the subject: "The friend has proven your credibility to the Immortal Ark. After unanimous discussion by the Immortal Ark elders, perhaps we can engage in deeper cooperation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan became interested: "Do you still have immortal seal scripts that you haven't taken out?"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daoqing waved his hand: "Not immortal seal scripts. But it's even more important than immortal seal scripts."</p><p></p><p>The surrounding pavilion scenery suddenly changed, as if instantly transported to the Darkest Sea of Stars.</p><p></p><p>Following Zhong Daoqing's movements, the lights and shadows around changed rapidly, passing through the endless sea of relics and the boundless Remnant Realm walls.</p><p></p><p>They arrived at a place of nothingness.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." Li Fan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"The High Wall. Below the High Wall," Zhong Daoqing said with a complex expression and solemn tone.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked around, then said: "I've also been to the end of the Darkest Sea below the High Wall before. The path ahead was cut off, but I didn't see the actual High Wall..."</p><p></p><p>"Why are you showing the scenery of the High Wall?"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daoqing's gaze deepened: "The High Wall stretches endlessly, encircling the entire sea of stars. However, the part of the High Wall that we of the Immortal Ark are showing you now is different from other places."</p><p></p><p>"Different? As the same High Wall, what exactly is the difference?" Li Fan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>It was Jiandao Sheng who answered Li Fan: "This area can be said to be the weakest part of the entire High Wall. If there is anywhere in the sea of stars that can cross the High Wall, this place must have the greatest opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>"Your hometown must also have many cultivators who are unwilling to be trapped in the Darkest Sea of Stars for life after life, and want to escape, right? If we cooperate, it may not be impossible to succeed," Zhong Daoqing said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"The weakest part of the High Wall..." Li Fan stared at the scene displayed by the Immortal Ark, repeating it a few times.</p><p></p><p>Instead of answering, he asked in return: "How are you so sure? The existence of the High Wall has already surpassed current understanding. Formless and invisible, unattainable. Yet you can accurately identify its weakest point?"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Daoqing smiled slightly: "This matter involves the Immortal Ark's utmost secret. Before we confirm our cooperation, I cannot disclose it."</p><p></p><p>"However, rest assured, friend, this is absolutely not false. You can report this matter, and when more people come, the Immortal Ark can verify it for you in advance."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression turned grave. After pondering for a long time, he cupped his hands: "This matter is indeed of great importance, not something I can decide alone. After I return, I will definitely report it to my teachers. In any case, I must give you an answer."</p><p></p><p>"Then we'll wait for the friend's good news!"</p><p></p><p>Under the elders' send-off, Li Fan left the Immortal Ark with his flickering light and disappeared into the vast sea of stars.</p><p></p><p>"A risky gambit. If this matter is exposed..."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, this Daqiwenming is no weaker than us. After all, they survived the great catastrophe and occupy an entire cultivation realm. They are a suitable partner to cooperate with."</p><p></p><p>"And that realm-protecting divine instrument..."</p><p></p><p>The elders discussed animatedly.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, as Li Fan returned to the Wooden Sword Illusory Realm, he pondered the information the Immortal Ark had just revealed.</p><p></p><p>Although the Immortal Ark did not explicitly state it, based on the key information obtained from infiltration in the previous life, it was not difficult to judge the reason why they knew the weakest part of the High Wall.</p><p></p><p>"In the previous life, Zhong Daoqing once said that the reason the Xuanshang Immortal Ark split was because some people in the Immortal Ark decided to crash into the High Wall in an attempt to escape the sea of stars."</p><p></p><p>"And in the end, they succeeded."</p><p></p><p>"This weak part of the High Wall may be the location where the Xuanshang Immortal Ark crashed into the High Wall back then. Relying on the connection between the Xuan and Shang Immortal Arks, the Xuan Immortal Ark was thus able to determine the specific location..."</p><p></p><p>If the Immortal Ark crowd had not revealed this matter, Li Fan would have triggered the hidden move in the Baiwen Immortal Record to plunder all the treasures from them when he left earlier.</p><p></p><p>But now that the Immortal Ark still had secrets to uncover, he might as well wait a bit longer.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Ark has been obsessed with collecting immortal seal scripts. Apart from the power of the seal scripts themselves, there may also be the reason of this plan to escape the sea of stars."</p><p></p><p>"Crashing into the High Wall..."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know how the Xuanshang Immortal Ark managed to do it back then," Li Fan pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>In the Wooden Sword Illusory Realm, Yin Shangren was resting.</p><p></p><p>The others, however, were still traversing the Remnant Realm walls, searching for suitable world fragments that could be used as catalysts for the Xuan-Huang Pill.</p><p></p><p>After supplementing them with some Void Bright Crystals, Li Fan did not go to the Immortal Ark group.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he first returned to the Xuan-Huang Realm through the Celestial Horizon Formation.</p><p></p><p>In the Small Xuan World.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's figure flickered, appearing beside the sleeping Oushang Tian.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the Qian-Kun Bone Hand still gestating within him, Li Fan used his hand as a pen and wrote an ancient character.</p><p></p><p>Concentrating his divine sense, he observed the changes within Oushang Tian's body.</p><p></p><p>The understanding of the ancient characters was still at the most initial stage. And he also didn't input too much spiritual power, so the power of this ancient character symbol was extremely weak.</p>

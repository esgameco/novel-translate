            <p>Chapter 1179 - Different Times Inside and Outside</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't know what the consequences would be after falling into these voids. ◆𝐆𝐨𝐨𝐠𝐥𝐞 𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝟓𝟐𝟎𝐜𝐨𝐦 𝐭𝐨 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐝◆</p><p></p><p>There was also no way to distinguish the existence of these voids.</p><p></p><p>He could only adopt a desperate measure and continue to let the remaining stone puppets lead the way, while he himself avoided the routes where the inexplicably disappeared puppets had passed through.</p><p></p><p>As the number of stone puppets continued to decrease, Li Fan's heart slowly sank.</p><p></p><p>At this rate of attrition, it seemed absolutely impossible to reach the depths of the starry sea in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>However, what Li Fan was worried about did not happen.</p><p></p><p>When there were only thirty-three puppets left, after flying for a long time in the void, there were no more sudden disappearances of puppets.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that these voids do not widely exist in the Dark Starry Sea. Instead, they are densely gathered in a certain area."</p><p></p><p>"Outside the Xuanhuang Realm?" The Holy Fetus Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>The thirty-three puppets were in front, and the sword light transformed by Li Fan followed behind.</p><p></p><p>The speed kept increasing as they headed towards the unknown darkness ahead.</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit smoother than I expected."</p><p></p><p>"Now we are already a considerable distance away from the Xuanhuang Realm, but this Xuanhuang Realm sword dao incarnation of mine doesn't feel any weakening of power."</p><p></p><p>"This is quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>According to common sense, without the support of the world's power, the various laws that wander outside the world will inevitably be weakened to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>But now this reduction did not appear.</p><p></p><p>Even...</p><p></p><p>The sword dao, which had already reached its limit in the Xuanhuang Realm and could not be further comprehended no matter what, suddenly loosened its bottleneck after staying in the void for a while.</p><p></p><p>Even though the talent of this Holy Fetus was not particularly outstanding, he felt that all kinds of thoughts and insights came rushing uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had directly transformed into some unparalleled genius.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan even had the urge to ignore everything and concentrate all his energy on comprehending the Dao.</p><p></p><p>But this was forcibly suppressed by Li Fan operating the Immortal Heart Mantra.</p><p></p><p>This abnormal phenomenon made Li Fan's imagination run wild.</p><p></p><p>"The entire Dark Starry Sea actually shares a common system of laws?"</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Realm's sword dao is a part of the common sword dao of the entire starry sea."</p><p></p><p>"Outside the world, in the void, one can see a broader world. The upper limit is invisibly expanded..."</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed a place where danger and opportunity coexist."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Heavenly Doctor and the Dharma Transmitter often run to the Dark Starry Sea without hesitation. There must be this factor involved as well."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the Heavenly Doctor and the Dharma Transmitter, Li Fan's heart became even more solemn.</p><p></p><p>It was hard to imagine what realm these two, who had lived in the starry sea for thousands of years, had already reached.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor's advice was indeed words of wisdom.</p><p></p><p>Even the "disease" in the void that he treated very cautiously still descended upon the Holy Fetus Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Without any warning.</p><p></p><p>Just when Li Fan was immersed in the joy of his impending breakthrough in sword dao comprehension, an inexplicable sense of weakness suddenly surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Upon introspection, a black spot indeed appeared in his soul.</p><p></p><p>That black spot corroded his soul, as if it directly occupied his original soul.</p><p></p><p>No matter how many treasures Li Fan had previously swallowed to protect his soul, they could not stop its invasion.</p><p></p><p>And the prepared means to nourish the soul had no effect either.</p><p></p><p>"The upper limit of soul strength has decreased, not the soul itself being damaged."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan was a bit solemn.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the speed at which this black spot spread was not too</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Quickly, Li Fan still had time to take corresponding countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>In his soul, a sword shadow appeared.</p><p></p><p>The sword light flashed, directly cutting off the part of the soul occupied by the black spots!</p><p></p><p>And as the soul was divided, the sword body of the Holy Fetus Li Fan also instantly split in half.</p><p></p><p>The part that was not eroded by the black spots suddenly accelerated and escaped from its original location.</p><p></p><p>The infected half, on the other hand, stopped moving forward.</p><p></p><p>Sitting cross-legged in the void, he concentrated on perceiving the inexplicable dark intent in his weakened soul.</p><p></p><p>The pain of splitting the soul was indescribable.</p><p></p><p>Even with the blessing of the Immortal Heart Mantra, the Holy Fetus Li Fan felt his vision go black and almost fainted directly.</p><p></p><p>The feeling of being even weaker than when he was invaded by the black spots suddenly surged in his heart, and he ignored the pain and weakness.</p><p></p><p>He quickly absorbed the essence of the soul-nourishing treasures he had previously refined.</p><p></p><p>Without the suppression of the black spots, the clean soul of the Holy Fetus Li Fan slowly became strong again.</p><p></p><p>"This is called scraping the bones to heal the wounds."</p><p></p><p>It was only because of the new strange method, the indestructible foundation of cultivation, and the undamaged body. Plus, he had built his cultivation foundation with the Xuanhuang Sword Dao.</p><p></p><p>Only then could he support himself in cutting his own soul so wantonly without becoming an idiot on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, without the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven and the Wuji Yingxu Method, relying on these external objects is ultimately not a long-term solution."</p><p></p><p>"Every time I cut, I become a little weaker than before."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"I hope I can hold on until the depths of the Starry Sea."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes, temporarily putting aside all distracting thoughts, and repaired the trauma to his soul.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the other part that was previously infected by the black spots and left in the void had completely met its end in death.</p><p></p><p>It was an ending more desperate and terrifying than dying of old age.</p><p></p><p>Just like a mortal suffering from senile dementia, the half that was originally perceiving the black spots had thoughts that became slower and slower.</p><p></p><p>The mind became more and more dull, and even the things he wanted to do required a long time to recall.</p><p></p><p>Even the consciousness transmitted from other synchronized bodies seemed to be blocked by layers and was completely incomprehensible.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it completely fell into a standstill of thought.</p><p></p><p>Like the soul, it completely turned into a dead silence.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Just like this Abyssal Starry Sea."</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Realm, the Yanfa Jue space.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's true body felt the image information transmitted from the Holy Fetus and secretly felt a chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>What made him frown was not the invisible void or the black spot plague in the Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>But the time difference between the true body and the Holy Fetus.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus had turned into a sword, borrowing the power of the Starry Sea, and had already left the Xuanhuang Realm for a long distance.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Fan was able to discover that between the Xuanhuang Realm and the depths of the Abyssal Starry Sea...</p><p></p><p>The time flow was not synchronized.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that it is still affected by the Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>"Although it's not as terrifying as the edge of the Immortal Ruins, where a moment passes like a thousand years. But the time flow is still slower than other parts of the Abyssal Starry Sea."</p><p></p><p>"Now, it's about a one-to-two ratio."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, as the Holy Fetus continues to move away, this ratio is still expanding."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but think more.</p><p></p><p>"The Abyssal Starry Sea within the high walls is inevitably all affected by the Immortal Ruins. It's just a matter of degree."</p><p></p><p>"Then, does that mean that the time flow inside and outside the high walls is also not exactly the same?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible that tens of thousands of years have passed since the catastrophe that cut off the ancient immortal path in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"And outside the high walls, in fact..."</p><p></p><p>"Has even more time passed?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan's eyes closed involuntarily, concealing the faint light within them.</p>

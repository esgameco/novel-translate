        <h1>Chapter 960</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Just like prescribing the right medicine for an illness. The golden needle bestowed by the Heavenly Doctor underwent a transformation after coming into contact with Li Fan's soul.</p><p></p><p>It formed a tightly enveloping protective layer around Li Fan's soul, conforming to its shape.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it can be used as easily as moving an arm without needing to refine it. This is simply like a tailor-made magic treasure, perfectly compatible with the soul."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes slightly and exerted the power of his soul to launch an impact from the inside out on this layer of golden needle protection.</p><p></p><p>The moment the soul impact collided with the protective layer, Li Fan felt it being bounced off by a soft force, which then spread out like ripples around the point of impact.</p><p></p><p>The impact force was evenly distributed and then easily dissipated. </p><p></p><p>With such a level of protection on the inside of the protective layer, one can imagine how tough the exterior must be.</p><p></p><p>After continuous testing, Li Fan gave it the rating of "as solid as an impenetrable fortress".</p><p></p><p>"However, the protection of the golden needle is limited to the soul. If it's purely physical destruction, its protective effect is actually inferior to ordinary armor-type magic treasures."</p><p></p><p>"As long as the needle remains intact, the person will not perish..."</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Doctor's words were not an exaggeration. As long as the soul is complete, with his power, helping to reconstruct the physical body is but a trivial matter."</p><p></p><p>"And to destroy the soul, one must first break through the golden needle's protective layer."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps..."</p><p></p><p>A scene suddenly flashed in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>At the moment before suffering a fatal blow, just as the golden needle is about to shatter, the golden light would soar into the sky, enveloping Li Fan's soul and flying back into the Heavenly Doctor's hands.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was certain that the Heavenly Doctor definitely still had a certain level of control over the golden needle he bestowed.</p><p></p><p>While this was undoubtedly out of care for the "currently only inheritor of the Heavenly Law Realm", it was not a good thing for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>How could he allow something he cannot fully control to envelop his own soul?</p><p></p><p>If his soul were to be frozen, leading to the inability to return to reality, that would truly be an irreversible disaster!</p><p></p><p>"Is there any way to enjoy the protection of the golden needle while also ensuring absolute safety..."</p><p></p><p>In front of the faceless stone statue, Li Fan began to ponder.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he currently had few trump cards that could restrain the Heavenly Doctor's power.</p><p></p><p>And they were all uncontrollable variables.</p><p></p><p>For example, Chaos, Hunger, the Gray Mold, etc.</p><p></p><p>If he was slightly careless, the consequences would be the destruction of the universe and mutual annihilation.</p><p></p><p>After much thought, Li Fan finally set his sights on the golden wish power generated from the faceless stone statue.</p><p></p><p>The golden wish power had previously been stored by Li Fan in the Calamity Body in his dantian. Whenever it was about to be filled, the golden wish power would automatically compress itself without Li Fan's manipulation.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, although the golden wish power accumulated during this period was already vast and mighty, it still couldn't fill even one Calamity Body.</p><p></p><p>The golden wish power was an existence that transcended the level of power systems Li Fan had currently come into contact with, and he had not yet found a way to use it.</p><p></p><p>The only thing he could do was guide it.</p><p></p><p>"Wish power, wish power..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be activated according to the thoughts in one's heart, allowing its power to be utilized?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart suddenly stirred as he began to experiment.</p><p></p><p>The result was obvious. It was as if they were two completely different species. The golden wish power...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Completely unresponsive to Li Fan's call.</p><p></p><p>After trying without success, Li Fan had no choice but to change his approach.</p><p></p><p>He created another karma body and slowly guided the golden wish power into it. At the same time, he urged the karma body to transform into the shape of a long rope.</p><p></p><p>Like a pipe, it carried the slowly moving golden wish power.</p><p></p><p>As this pipe surrounded and wrapped around the golden needle protection encasing Li Fan's soul, it slowly wove an outer garment.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the process, Li Fan was exceptionally careful and cautious.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Heavenly Doctor's Golden Needles or the golden wish power, they were both forces that he could not currently control.</p><p></p><p>Only by guiding them to form a mutual restraint between the two could he feel a little bit of reassurance.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, doing this outside of one's own soul was extremely dangerous.</p><p></p><p>The slightest carelessness would result in the destruction of the soul.</p><p></p><p>But with Huan Zhen present, Li Fan still had the qualifications to boldly try it out!</p><p></p><p>"If something really goes wrong, they will certainly notice each other's enormous presence first. And instinctively ignore me, this ant. This is their natural instinct."</p><p></p><p>"It's actually a bit safer than me facing either of them alone."</p><p></p><p>"This is the so-called way of checks and balances."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the karma body filled with golden wish power, like a golden thread, intertwined with the golden needle protection, and couldn't help but nod in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>If the Heavenly Doctor's Golden Needles erupted, they would definitely first trigger the golden wish power.</p><p></p><p>And vice versa.</p><p></p><p>And if Li Fan were to suffer a fatal blow from the outside world, the attacker would suffer a double counterattack from the Heavenly Doctor's Golden Needles and the golden wish power.</p><p></p><p>To use an inappropriate analogy, Li Fan was currently equivalent to having two linked bombs tied to his body.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan believed that even if it was the Eternal Life Venerable, being attacked by these two forces at the same time would definitely not be pleasant!</p><p></p><p>And if necessary, Li Fan could even actively detonate these two bombs to achieve unexpected effects!</p><p></p><p>"Adapt to the situation, be flexible. This is my true nature..."</p><p></p><p>When the balance between the two was finally achieved, Li Fan quietly admired his own masterpiece, and couldn't help feeling a little pleased with himself.</p><p></p><p>However, he quickly sobered up.</p><p></p><p>"This is just an expedient measure taken out of necessity. If I could thoroughly study the Heavenly Doctor's Golden Needles and form my own soul protection..."</p><p></p><p>"Since the Heavenly Doctor can do this, there's no reason I can't."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully sensed the energy attributes of the Heavenly Doctor's Golden Needles outside his soul, and combined with the contents of the "Heavenly Doctor Immortal Scripture" and "Patching Heaven Records", he secretly pondered.</p><p></p><p>Like this, who knows how long had passed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was startled awake by an image in his mind.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the task he had previously given to the believers of the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal, to find someone who could reconstruct a cultivator's appearance before death based on their skull, finally had some clues.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Fan thought it would be a very simple matter, but in reality, in the vast Xuanhuang Realm, apart from Li Fan, no one else had this need.</p><p></p><p>Since there was no practical value in using it, naturally no cultivator would study this technique.</p><p></p><p>It was only after Li Fan issued the task and offered a reward that cultivators were motivated by the benefits to attempt to do so.</p><p></p><p>"Tongyan Province, Luo Suzhen."</p><p></p><p>After grasping the information of the target cultivator, Li Fan thought for a moment and finally decided to personally take action.</p><p></p><p>It concerned Huan Zhen, an existence he greatly desired, so he had to take it seriously.</p><p></p><p>His figure flew like a ghost.</p><p></p><p>Very quickly, Li Fan arrived in front of Luo Suzhen's cave abode.</p>

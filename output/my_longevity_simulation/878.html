        <h1>Chapter 878</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Under the gaze of the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate, the layers of defenses set up by the Five Elders Society in Jiushan Prefecture collapsed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>In the face of the absolute power gap, all struggles and resistance were futile!</p><p></p><p>All living beings within the prefecture, including the cultivators stationed by the Five Elders Society, the Lingyuan Sect followers, and even countless mortals.</p><p></p><p>They all perished in the moment the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate opened her eyes!</p><p></p><p>Just as the Xuanhuang Realm could not withstand the direct gaze of a True Immortal.</p><p></p><p>The living beings of Jiushan Prefecture also could not face the might of Dharma Transmission directly!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless cultivators died.</p><p></p><p>Originally, there should have been endless falling phenomena in the sky.</p><p></p><p>But perhaps because the figure of Dharma Transmission did not dissipate.</p><p></p><p>Under the oppressive might, those falling phenomena also failed to condense for a long time.</p><p></p><p>This scene was as if even the Heavenly Dao of the Xuanhuang Realm was restrained in front of the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate, not daring to wantonly issue ridicule and celebration for the death of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The footage provided by the Five Elders Society abruptly ended.</p><p></p><p>Although it was indeed somewhat shocking.</p><p></p><p>But for Li Fan, who had already witnessed the scene of a True Immortal destroying the world...</p><p></p><p>It was nothing special.</p><p></p><p>After repeatedly savoring it, Li Fan still immediately noticed something amiss.</p><p></p><p>"Dharma Transmission? One of the thirty-three Immortal Chosen?"</p><p></p><p>During the 115th era, the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate had once revealed her true appearance.</p><p></p><p>The entire Xuanhuang Realm trembled under her might.</p><p></p><p>As if the end of the world was about to come, and it could be completely torn apart by her power at any time.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate who appeared in Jiushan Prefecture this time was not only one step weaker.</p><p></p><p>"What is this, a projection? An avatar?"</p><p></p><p>A glimmer flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>In his perception, Wei Qizheng, one of the Immortal Chosen, was still alive and well.</p><p></p><p>And just now, the cultivators of the Five Elders Society had also mentioned that she, that is, the Dharma Transmission Phantom, might appear more frequently in the future.</p><p></p><p>This proved that it was not a one-time consumable means, but an operation that could be repeatedly reproduced.</p><p></p><p>"Although the strength is far inferior to the Dharma Transmission's true body, it is definitely the combat power of the Eternal Life Realm."</p><p></p><p>"More crucially, it is still unclear how the Dharma Transmission Projection appeared in the sky of Jiushan Prefecture. From beginning to end, those Immortal Chosen never appeared. If the location restriction can be ignored and the Dharma Transmission Projection can be summoned to descend at will..."</p><p></p><p>"Then the deterrence is too great. Before finding a countermeasure, the Five Elders Society simply does not dare to act rashly."</p><p></p><p>Who knows how many living beings were buried here not long ago. But it was very peculiar that not a bit of bloody smell could be smelled.</p><p></p><p>After all, under the oppressive might of Dharma Transmission, even blood was crushed out of existence.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of a means in the form of Dharma Transmission. Rather than killing, it's more like annihilation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Having figured out what happened in Jiushan Prefecture, Li Fan did not linger here.</p><p></p><p>He quickly returned through the power of the earth veins.</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, if the Five Elders Society wants to counterattack next, they are very likely to use the [Samantabhadra True Boat] to launch a surprise attack in the white fog."</p><p></p><p>"As long as the battle starts in the belly of the Immortal Alliance, the Wanxian Alliance will have to consider carefully if they want to use that Dharma Transmission Projection move again."</p><p></p><p>"But this kind of special move has the greatest effect only the first time. The Five Elders Society should be thinking of using it at the decisive battle moment to settle the matter once and for all..."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting. Let's see how the Five Elders Society will choose."</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmission Projection</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The deterrent power of the Heavenly Demon Sword was indeed extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was only used once in Jiushan Prefecture, it scared the members of the Five Elders Society in other fallen border regions, causing them to quickly withdraw their forces.</p><p></p><p>With almost no effort, the Wanxian Alliance swiftly reclaimed the several lost border prefectures.</p><p></p><p>The frequent reports of victories left the cultivators, who were accustomed to the Wanxian Alliance's defeats, in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>As a result, conspiracy theories began to circulate in various places.</p><p></p><p>In the Congyun Sea, on Haixuan Island.</p><p></p><p>"The speed at which the Immortal Alliance is recovering lost territories is too fast. Do you think there's something strange going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I heard a rumor. It's said that these few prefectures were not actually taken back by our Wanxian Alliance. Instead, the Five Elders Society deliberately returned them to us!"</p><p></p><p>"After working so hard to capture them, how could the Five Elders Society be willing to give them up so easily?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't know this, do you? They were returned, but what was returned was just a pile of ruins. Anything of value had been looted by the Five Elders Society. According to a friend of mine, the situation in those frontline prefectures is now miserable!"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk! I get it! This is the Five Elders Society's scheme. Once the lost territories are recovered, they will need to be rebuilt, right? After we work hard to rebuild them, the Five Elders Society will attack again! At that time, they will loot everything once more..."</p><p></p><p>"I told you, how come we suddenly became so tough? So that's how it is!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Conspiracy theories are always popular among the masses.</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators began to speculate about the possible conspiracies behind this.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were discussing and enjoying themselves, they didn't know that their conversation had angered two people.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>With a loud slam on the table, a figure abruptly stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Originally, I thought that the Congyun Sea Mutual Aid Society was a renowned organization."</p><p></p><p>"But I never expected that its members would be so despicable!"</p><p></p><p>The man glanced around at the cultivators present and said coldly, "Right now, the war on the frontlines has not yet subsided, and who knows how many fellow cultivators have lost their lives on the battlefield. You group of people not only don't contribute, but you even gossip behind their backs!"</p><p></p><p>"I, Kou Hong, am ashamed to be associated with you!"</p><p></p><p>"Ptui!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong glared at them, his voice thundering like lightning.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, another tall and handsome cultivator in white robes stood up and laughed loudly, "My brother speaks well. I, Dao Xuanzi, also despise these beasts!"</p><p></p><p>Their words instantly offended the small group from earlier.</p><p></p><p>They looked at Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi coldly, a hint of murderous intent flashing in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>If this place wasn't Ji Shaoli's territory, they would have taken the lives of these two outspoken cultivators on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of mutual aid society is this? It's better not to stay!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi said indignantly, about to leave their seats.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment, you two!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, someone stopped them.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked closely and bowed in respect.</p><p></p><p>It turned out to be the owner of Haixuan Island and the organizer of the Congyun Sea Mutual Aid Society, Ji Shaoli himself!</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Ji, as the saying goes, those with different principles should not work together. Let's part ways here today!" Kou Hong turned his head away, ignoring Ji Shaoli. However, Dao Xuanzi still had some courtesy and said with cupped hands.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's avatar didn't speak, but looking at the two familiar faces in front of him, a smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but sigh in his heart, "Fate is truly wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the two of them, who according to the original historical trajectory would still only be at the Foundation Establishment stage even after several decades, now already at the early Golden Core stage.</p>

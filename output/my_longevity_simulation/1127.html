        <div class="content">
            <p>"The Great Array of All Spirits, connecting myriad worlds. How could such a bizarre change occur after the array was formed? Something must have gone wrong."</p><p></p><p>An intense unease arose in his heart, and the cultivator was about to shut down the array.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>It was all too late.</p><p></p><p>The array, for some unknown reason, suddenly started operating on its own.</p><p></p><p>A giant, blood-red eye slowly opened, revealing an eerie vertical pupil.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The entire mortal world began to tremble violently.</p><p></p><p>Countless beams of blood light rose from the earth, like pillars of light, converging into the giant blood-red eye in the sky.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of stupor, when the cultivator realized what had just happened, endless despair and fear surged on his face.</p><p></p><p>Because at the moment the blood-red vertical pupil appeared, all living beings in this mortal world were instantly killed.</p><p></p><p>Transformed into blood light, absorbed by the blood-red pupil.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator's body trembled uncontrollably, and endless coldness enveloped his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although he had also committed considerable sins, compared to the act of instantly killing all living beings in a world, it was not on the same level at all.</p><p></p><p>"We were all deceived. What a compassionate true immortal..."</p><p></p><p>"This is clearly an incomparably terrifying evil god!"</p><p></p><p>Scenes from the past four years flooded his mind, and unspeakable fear gradually engulfed the cultivator.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the last remaining conscience in his heart suddenly awakened him from despair.</p><p></p><p>A ray of hope burst forth in the cultivator's eyes, and he suddenly remembered something: "No, I can't let others follow in my footsteps and repeat the same mistakes. I must hurry and notify them..."</p><p></p><p>The cultivator was about to flee in panic.</p><p></p><p>But he discovered that the blood-red vertical pupil in the sky had already locked onto him at some unknown time.</p><p></p><p>And just as the cultivator felt chilled to the bone, thinking he would die under the giant blood-red eye.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a breeze blew through heaven and earth, and then a phantom figure inexplicably emerged.</p><p></p><p>Instantly attracting the gaze of the blood-red vertical pupil in the sky.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan, far away in the Xuanhuang Realm, narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>He was no stranger to that phantom figure.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. White?"</p><p></p><p>"Was this a one-time mass slaughter of too many living beings, causing the Immortal Miasma to suddenly erupt in a short period of time, triggering a counteraction?"</p><p></p><p>The phantom figure stood between heaven and earth. Although its facial expression could not be seen clearly, one could still feel boundless anger from it.</p><p></p><p>The phantom's gaze swept across this world, and then locked onto the only survivor.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator immediately felt unable to move, and a sense of impending death surged in his heart. He struggled to say something.</p><p></p><p>The phantom did not listen to his explanation at all.</p><p></p><p>A wave of fluctuation instantly crossed thousands of miles, descending from the phantom to the cultivator's body.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator's body suddenly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>Then strands of hair turned from black to white, skin wrinkled like withered wood...</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the cultivator changed from a middle-aged appearance to an old man on the verge of running out of oil and light.</p><p></p><p>And then, completely turned into a skeleton.</p><p></p><p>Falling from the sky.</p><p></p><p>After completing this act of revenge, Mr. White's phantom looked at the empty world devoid of any other living beings.</p><p></p><p>A trace of sorrow appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>Reluctantly taking one last look, he then scattered with the wind.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Realm, Li Fan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect the Immortal Miasma to have this form as well."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm quickly agreed to the proposal of mortal migration back then. It seems they also discovered this secret."</p><p></p><p>"Every injustice has its perpetrator, every debt has its debtor. Whoever went to set up the array, you go find them, don't give me..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter at all." Li Fan said with a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>"It just saves me the trouble of cleaning up."</p><p></p><p>The passing of one villain did not attract the attention of the other villains.</p><p></p><p>As one grand formation after another was established and joined into the God Refining Network,</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was getting closer and closer to his final goal in this world.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the countless living beings' consciousnesses in the God Refining Formation. Even as the mastermind behind this matter, claiming to have the right to ignore everything in the world after obtaining Huan Zhen,</p><p></p><p>He still felt uneasy in his heart and dared not look directly at it for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"The power of endless living beings is truly terrifying and formidable."</p><p></p><p>"I think even true immortals would pale in comparison in this sea of living beings."</p><p></p><p>However, his eyes quickly became resolute again.</p><p></p><p>"All of this is necessary."</p><p></p><p>"With the immortal path severed, even people like Chuan Fa, Xuan Tian Wang, and Mr. Bai will be trapped here forever."</p><p></p><p>"Only by finding the true method of liberation can everything be finally resolved."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, even if I don't make a move, the entire Xuan Huang Realm will eventually face a destructive end."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze became extremely cold again.</p><p></p><p>Under his instructions, the construction speed of the Myriad Spirits Grand Formation accelerated once more.</p><p></p><p>In the end, this supreme grand formation covering many mortal worlds was fully formed.</p><p></p><p>And just at this moment, five paper men from the Du E Sect appeared beside Li Fan in a timely manner.</p><p></p><p>This time, however, they did not nag Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they all looked towards the sky of the Xuan Huang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"How strange. How could the Xuan Huang Realm seem to have lost control and accelerated after just taking a nap?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the suction force of the Immortal Ruins has strengthened again?"</p><p></p><p>"In so many years, such a strange thing has never happened. The magnitude of change is limited, so we didn't notice it at first..."</p><p></p><p>The five little men discussed and actually ignored Li Fan's existence.</p><p></p><p>After careful observation, Li Fan discovered that they were not the ones who had appeared before to admonish him from time to time.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they were characters who had never appeared before.</p><p></p><p>They seemed to hold high positions in the Du E Sect and were in charge of monitoring the crisis in the Xuan Huang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had no intention of communicating with them.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he directly activated the formation to forcibly pull them back into the Book of Crossing Tribulations.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Such an anomaly quickly aroused the vigilance of the five little men.</p><p></p><p>They stared at Li Fan, and the expressions on their faces slowly turned horrified.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>The Book of Crossing Tribulations trembled, and the pages flipped on their own without wind.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that a large number of paper men were about to surge out from within.</p><p></p><p>However, before they could achieve anything, under the restraint of invisible forces,</p><p></p><p>Those five little men were forcibly pulled into the Book of Crossing Tribulations.</p><p></p><p>The book also slowly closed.</p><p></p><p>But it was still jumping and resisting.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression remained unchanged, and he kept reinforcing the sealing formation.</p><p></p><p>Until the Book of Crossing Tribulations completely stopped moving.</p><p></p><p>"Since you chose to be a turtle hiding its head, then stay that way forever."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuan Huang Realm doesn't need you to save it."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said lightly and suppressed the Book of Crossing Tribulations in the deepest part of the Five Elements Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Spirits and Living Beings God Refining Grand Formation had been set up.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's last insurance lock fell, and next, he was going to prepare to initiate the final plan.</p><p></p><p>"After my observation this past year, I have confirmed that Chuan Fa should not be in the Xuan Huang Realm."</p>

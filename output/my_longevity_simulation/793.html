            <p>Mr. Bai's smile gradually faded away. 新𝟞𝟡書吧→𝟞𝟡𝕤𝕙𝕦𝕩.𝕔𝕠𝕞</p><p>Instead, a trace of solemnity flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Under his gaze, the originally ferocious and vicious Emperor Beast suddenly stopped in mid-air.</p><p>Then, it was as if invisible flames were scorching its body.</p><p>Melting, disappearing.</p><p>One by one, holes appeared in succession.</p><p>The Emperor Beast let out sharp and frenzied screams of agony.</p><p>But there was not a hint of pity on Mr. Bai's face.</p><p>His eyes grew even more profound, and the fierce invisible flames, like torture, constantly tormented the Emperor Beast.</p><p>In Changsheng Valley, everyone who witnessed this scene trembled in fear.</p><p>Although the vast majority of them were unclear about Mr. Bai's strength and realm,</p><p>The terrifying pressure emanating from the supreme beast released from the smelting furnace was something everyone could feel.</p><p>Even a Dao-merging cultivator would probably not fare well against it.</p><p>Yet such a terrifying beast was completely powerless to resist in front of Mr. Bai.</p><p>It could only allow itself to be slowly tortured and dissipated between heaven and earth.</p><p>Having personally refined the Emperor Beast, Li Fan had a clear understanding of its strength.</p><p>He did not expect the Emperor Beast to pose any hindrance to Mr. Bai.</p><p>In fact, just like before,</p><p>The demon beast was merely a prelude.</p><p>It was not in the Xuanhuang realm, but hidden within the secret realm of Changsheng Valley.</p><p>Thus, Senior Brother Zhang's grand dharma body arrived a little late.</p><p>Only when the Emperor Beast had been reduced to one-tenth of its size did a purple qi leisurely arrive.</p><p>The purple light shone brightly, transforming into a tall figure standing as high as the heavens. 新𝟔𝟗書吧𝟨𝟫🅢🅗🅤🅧.🅒🅞🅜</p><p>Ignoring everyone present, it only stared at the Emperor Beast trapped by Mr. Bai.</p><p>The Purple Heaven Divine Thunder condensed into a long spear and fiercely pierced down.</p><p>Mr. Bai looked at the dharma image in the sky but did not stop Senior Brother Zhang's attack.</p><p>However, at the moment the Emperor Beast was struck by the purple divine thunder,</p><p>The remaining parts of the Emperor Beast actively exploded.</p><p>An extremely thick and even somewhat terrifying blood mist instantly spread in all directions along with the explosion.</p><p>Even the Purple Heaven Divine Thunder, capable of purifying all demons and evils, had its light obscured.</p><p>Because...</p><p>During the initial process of refining the Emperor Beast, Li Fan had added something.</p><p>It was the "Blood Essence of Ten Thousand People" collected in a certain world and since then stored in the "Huan Zhen" space.</p><p>The power of the Immortal Miasma suddenly erupted, and even Mr. Bai had no choice but to temporarily avoid its edge.</p><p>At this moment,</p><p>In the underground chamber, Li Fan abruptly opened his eyes.</p><p>"It's time!"</p><p>With a thought,</p><p>One-third of the Chaos Character Puppets buried in various parts of the Xuanhuang realm were detonated by Li Fan.</p><p>One after another, ominous and terrifying auras exploded in different places not long after.</p><p>At this moment, all the cultivators in the Xuanhuang realm felt a sense of impending doom.</p><p>Inexplicably shocked and terrified, their hearts raced.</p><p>Yet they could not explain the reason.</p><p>Moreover, one enormous divine sense after another swept across the Xuanhuang realm,</p><p>Trying to find the source of these disturbances. 新𝟔𝟗書吧𝟨𝟫𝕤𝕙𝕦𝕩.𝕔𝕠𝕞</p><p>The sky also changed color,</p><p>As if something was getting closer and closer to peeking in.</p><p>The impact brought about by the Chaos Character Technique was even better than Li Fan had expected.</p><p>Although distributed in various places, when they exploded together, they seemed to spontaneously form a connection.</p><p>Ignoring the spatial gaps, they vaguely merged into one.</p><p>Without deliberate inscription, they formed a huge, crooked "Chaos" character on the land of the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p>As strange events gradually occurred in different places, Li Fan's goal was also achieved.</p><p>Mr. Bai was the incarnation of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao.</p><p>His power also came from the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p>Mr. Bai's movements also experienced a brief, momentary stiffness.</p><p>And this was precisely the only possible chance of survival that Li Fan had been waiting for.</p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all of his prior preparations erupted simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>First, his avatar Xu Bai appeared in front of Mr. Bai. The two stared at each other, looking at the extremely similar faces across from them. Yet, they didn't exchange many words.</p><p></p><p>Avatar Xu Bai had no hesitation. In an instant, his own grotto-heaven collapsed with a bang. Xu Bai had committed suicide and perished!</p><p></p><p>Although after the holy blood incarnation gives birth to an avatar, the death of the original body will not implicate the brand new avatar. But after all, they come from the same source and have a mysterious connection between them.</p><p></p><p>The demise of the original body will inevitably bring some slight, indelible influence to the avatar. This is a natural limitation of the holy blood incarnation technique. Even with Mr. Bai's current cultivation, it is still unavoidable.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Mr. Bai's paralysis was prolonged for another moment. After avatar Xu Bai disappeared, Li Fan instantly felt that the mysterious connection with Mr. Bai was cut off quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>He tried, and although he could open the Huanzhen panel, he still couldn't confirm Huanzhen. So Li Fan began his next move.</p><p></p><p>With a step, he left the cultivation secret room in an instant. After his departure, the hidden ninety-nine Chaos Character Puppets in the secret room exploded with a bang.</p><p></p><p>The power of [Chaos] instantly enveloped Changsheng Valley. The sky was obscured by a hazy force. A chaos descended.</p><p></p><p>Like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, hundreds of yellow withered branches suddenly grew out of the ground in Changsheng Valley. Looking at their faces, they were surprisingly exactly the same as Li Fan's!</p><p></p><p>They all showed strange smiles to the people present, and then quickly retracted back into the ground and disappeared. Everyone, including Mr. Bai, had their attention drawn by this scene.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a greater upheaval struck. It was the ripples set off by the simultaneous detonation of the remaining two-thirds of the Chaos Character Puppets. Mr. Bai's body was once again paralyzed.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, when no one was paying attention, a small black cauldron soared into the sky. It was about to break through the secret realm and fly towards the sky of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if he acted in the most secretive manner, there were still many people present after all, and someone still discovered the departing Medicine King's True Cauldron. A cry of alarm drew everyone's eyes.</p><p></p><p>But soon, their faces changed even more. Below the Medicine King's True Cauldron, countless human figures were suddenly thrown out forcefully in different directions like garbage.</p><p></p><p>Liu San's body shook violently, and his face suddenly changed. Because he had already seen that these were all the Medicine King Sect disciples who were slumbering in the Medicine King's True Cauldron!</p><p></p><p>They were all old-method cultivators with weak bodies. And they were still in a state of slumber. Being thrown at such a fast speed, if they crashed to the ground like this, perhaps except for a few exceptionally powerful ones, the rest would either die or be crippled!</p><p></p><p>"Save them!" Liu San shouted repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the Medicine King Sect reacted one after another. But there were too many cultivators being thrown down, and they all flew in different directions.</p><p></p><p>Inside Changsheng Valley, it was even more affected by the Chaos Characters, making it a bit difficult for the cultivators themselves to fly, and there was a risk of falling. They could barely take care of themselves, let alone save others.</p><p></p><p>Liu San's eyes were bloodshot, and even using all his strength, he only managed to save a dozen or so people. Just as he was feeling a bit desperate, Mr. Bai, who had already recovered from his paralysis, stretched out his hand.</p><p></p><p>He embraced all the falling cultivators and then gently placed them on the ground. The influence of the Chaos Characters had not yet disappeared. After doing all this, Mr. Bai's right elbow strangely rotated a circle, as if it had been broken.</p><p></p><p>Although it quickly returned to normal, it still made him slightly frown. "Thank you, Senior, for the rescue!" After checking that none of his fellow sect members were in mortal danger, Liu San flew forward, cupped his hands and said very gratefully.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai did not speak, only looking at the Medicine King's True Cauldron that had already disappeared in the sky, as well as the hundreds of puppets that had already fled to a place several states away.</p><p></p><p>And at Li Fan's corpse lying on the ground, which had already lost its vitality.</p>

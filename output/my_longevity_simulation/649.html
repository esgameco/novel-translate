            <p>Five statues with indiscernible faces stood in a circle.</p><p></p><p>The statues bowed their heads, overlooking the center.</p><p></p><p>There, a large glowing cloud floated in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Within the cloud, miniature scenes of land, mountains, rivers, and streams could faintly be seen.</p><p></p><p>The cloud was divided into various isolated areas, each area suspended a small glowing spot.</p><p></p><p>At the edge of this glowing cloud, in a small blue area, there was a black dot moving irregularly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, in an instant, this area erupted in several different colors.</p><p></p><p>Then, as if an intense explosion occurred, a slight vibration spread from this area towards the surrounding cloud.</p><p></p><p>Like clouds swayed by the wind, the cloud fluttered gently.</p><p></p><p>Then, a large black mass suddenly surged out from the turbulent area on the edge of the glowing cloud.</p><p></p><p>Swiftly engulfing it all.</p><p></p><p>As if something suddenly bit down and swallowed everything, the area blinked out and disappeared into the light.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>Except for the central statue with closed eyes and bowed head, the other four statues all opened their eyes in an instant.</p><p></p><p>They all gazed towards the now-vanished area.</p><p></p><p>An eerie atmosphere circulated within this space.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Yixin, what do you see?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, my eyes are dazzled, I can't see clearly."</p><p></p><p>"There's a force disturbing our perception. This seems to be..."</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>The scene fell silent in an instant.</p><p></p><p>As if sensing something.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, voices resonated once more.</p><p></p><p>"In addition to ['Chaos'], there are also ['Mystic Yellow Sky Palm'], ['Violet Firmament Body']..."</p><p></p><p>"It's been a while since Xuanhuang Realm has been this lively, I really look forward to more in the future," Zhao Senior Sister's lazy voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>The other three chose to ignore her.</p><p></p><p>"Each of us has triggered a divine ability, most likely due to the deal with the 'Sky Overturning Alliance.'"</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Qing'ang, Li Fan?"</p><p></p><p>"All dead?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, how interesting."</p><p></p><p>"These are just trivial matters, possibly a deliberate attempt to divert our attention with illusions. The key is why 'Chaos' has reappeared in Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"I will order my subordinates to investigate. However, it's best not to have too high hopes. This matter carries a hint of unusual significance."</p><p></p><p>"That ancient one transmitting the law seems to have disappeared again lately."</p><p></p><p>"I seem to recall something interesting, hehe."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Continuously communicating, the five statues eventually closed their eyes once again.</p><p></p><p>The space fell silent again.

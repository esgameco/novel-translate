            <p>Chapter 1065: The World-Destroying Black Tide Rises</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was the Myriad Immortal Alliance's misjudgment of the possible number of Dao-One Insects that might exist underground in Shilin Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The underground caves, with their twists and turns, not only occupied an area almost equivalent to an entire Shilin Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>They also kept expanding deeper underground.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan, who now controlled the entire insect swarm, had not yet figured out how big the Hundred Stone Heavenly Cave in Shilin Prefecture really was.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to such a vast breeding ground, the Dao-One Insects were able to multiply so rapidly.</p><p></p><p>In less than a month, they could devour the spiritual energy of an entire prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"Although paper is thin and can be broken with a snap of the fingers, if stacked in large quantities, it can withstand thousands of troops and horses!"</p><p></p><p>"How can you kill them all by yourself?"</p><p></p><p>Feeling the number of Dao-One Insects that continued to increase rather than decrease even under the slaughter of the Golden Sword Immortal Venerable, Li Fan showed a strange smile.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Huff huff..."</p><p></p><p>Looking at another emptied underground cave, the Golden Sword Immortal Venerable finally felt a hint of fatigue.</p><p></p><p>During this period, he had not rested for a moment. Thousands of golden swords crisscrossed, illuminating one dark underground cave after another, leaving behind a ground full of black insect corpses.</p><p></p><p>How many black insects had he slaughtered?</p><p></p><p>One billion? Ten billion?</p><p></p><p>Even with his Dao-Unifying Immortal Venerable's spiritual power reserves, they were now almost drained.</p><p></p><p>But it seemed that due to the depth underground, there were too many black insects here.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy was very thin and could not be absorbed to nourish himself.</p><p></p><p>Helplessly, the Golden Sword Immortal Venerable could only slowly recover by absorbing the spirit stones stored in his body.</p><p></p><p>"It's been many years since I've been in such a sorry state."</p><p></p><p>The Golden Sword Immortal Venerable, sitting on the ground, couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, memories surfaced of exploring the sect's ruins with his companions back when he was still a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he inexplicably stood up, his expression becoming solemn.</p><p></p><p>Because he finally realized what the inexplicable feeling in his heart meant since he set foot in this Hundred Stone Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>It was the warning from his keen spiritual perception that had not appeared for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Three hundred years ago, it was precisely by relying on this keen intuition that he became the only survivor of that exploration team.</p><p></p><p>However, after surviving the great calamity, everything had been going smoothly and he had not encountered any misfortune. He had almost forgotten this sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>Until today, after many years, this spiritual warning appeared again!</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>His thoughts turned rapidly, and he made a decision.</p><p></p><p>He immediately disregarded rest, his figure turning into a golden light, speeding towards the depths of the underground caves.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see first, just how big the scale of this Hundred Stone Heavenly Cave was!</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Sword Immortal Venerable's face was deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>With his flying speed, three days was enough to circle the territory of the Myriad Immortal Alliance several times.</p><p></p><p>But he still had not finished exploring this Hundred Stone Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>Like an abyss, like the sea, its depths could not be seen. It seemed to have no end at all.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Sword Immortal Venerable shuddered, and a terrifying image suddenly surged in his mind of the black insects densely packed in the caves, overflowing towards the outside world like surging seawater.</p><p></p><p>"Disaster, disaster."</p><p></p><p>"No, I must hurry and report the situation to the alliance headquarters."</p><p></p><p>The Golden Sword Immortal Venerable hastily took out a communication talisman, wanting to establish contact with the alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>But it seemed that due to being too deep underground, the communication could not be established.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Sword Immortal Venerable's heart was uneasy.</p><p></p><p>The premonition became stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>He sped up to the extreme, wanting to leave this underground cave.</p><p></p><p>But for some reason, those black bugs that were originally just quietly lying down and eating spiritual energy suddenly rushed towards him as if they had gone mad.</p><p></p><p>Trying to stop him from moving forward.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Golden Sword Immortal finally understood what it meant to be difficult to take a single step.</p><p></p><p>Without any reservations, all the golden swords refined by his body were unsheathed and surrounded him on both sides.</p><p></p><p>All the black bugs blocking his way were crushed into powder.</p><p></p><p>Golden Sword Immortal, with an unstoppable momentum, quickly returned from underground.</p><p></p><p>The difference between the black bugs in front and behind made Golden Sword Immortal increasingly certain that there were traces of a conspiracy behind this.</p><p></p><p>If it was not stopped quickly, it might not only affect Shilin Prefecture. Perhaps the entire Wanxian Alliance and even the Xuanhuang Realm would suffer heavily!</p><p></p><p>"Who exactly is plotting this unrighteous thing!"</p><p></p><p>When he finally broke through the layers of obstruction from the black bugs and saw the light of day again.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to urgently report the situation to the Immortal Alliance headquarters, he suddenly felt something in his heart and stood still.</p><p></p><p>Golden Sword Immortal looked up at the sky and stretched out his left hand.</p><p></p><p>"The wind... is picking up?"</p><p></p><p>Between heaven and earth, a gust of wind inexplicably blew.</p><p></p><p>Then the breeze gradually grew stronger, becoming more and more intense.</p><p></p><p>The howling sound rose like thunder, rumbling.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the blazing sun and clear sky were obscured by layers of dark clouds.</p><p></p><p>Under the shadow, at this moment, all the cultivators in Shilin Prefecture felt a sense of impending doom.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>A gust of demonic wind blew, so fierce that it made it a little difficult for Golden Sword Immortal to maintain his posture.</p><p></p><p>Although this demonic wind disappeared in an instant, the meaning behind it made this Immortal of the Harmonious Dao feel chilled to the bone.</p><p></p><p>There seemed to be a faint and dense sound of wind in his ears.</p><p></p><p>But Golden Sword did not sense any signs of wind.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was puzzled and confused, countless flying insects like a black tidal wave suddenly appeared from below.</p><p></p><p>Riding the wind, they surged out from the hundreds of stone caves.</p><p></p><p>Soaring to the ninth heaven, like a doomsday dark cloud, they spread unstoppably to various prefectures of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the face of the immeasurable sea of black bugs, Golden Sword's protective spiritual power was also like a small tree in a storm, in imminent danger.</p><p></p><p>Feeling horrified, Golden Sword Immortal no longer had the thought of stopping the disaster.</p><p></p><p>He only tried his best to ensure his own safety.</p><p></p><p>The black bugs in the underground caves seemed endless. As far as Golden Sword could see, he could no longer see any other scenes.</p><p></p><p>Falling into the nightmare of the black tide, moving and breathing became a pipe dream.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was not the direct target of the black bugs' attack, just being crushed by them on their migration path.</p><p></p><p>Under the sweeping of the boundless sea of black bugs, it still made this Immortal of the Harmonious Dao gradually lose consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"It's over..."</p><p></p><p>In the moment before he fainted, the first thing that came to Golden Sword Immortal's mind was not the safety of his own life.</p><p></p><p>But the ensuing accountability from the Wanxian Alliance after resolving the insect disaster in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, if I had known, I would never have agreed to this crappy task no matter what."</p><p></p><p>His figure slowly faded, eventually turning into a golden long sword that seemed to be composed of countless small swords, clanging as it fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, with the strength of the black bugs, at most they could make an Immortal of the Harmonious Dao exhausted and briefly faint.</p><p></p><p>But to kill them, it was a bit insufficient.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's figure emerged from the black tide.</p><p></p><p>He picked up this golden long sword, the corner of his mouth revealing a hint of a smile.</p><p></p><p>Then he casually placed tens of thousands of formation restrictions on it.</p>

            <p>Chapter 998: Three Lashes of the Divine Soul</p><p></p><p>Xuan Sushang took a deep breath and looked directly at Li Fan, saying slowly, "I am willing to help senior resolve the crisis, but..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan waved his hand, interrupting her words, "It doesn't matter, just tell me the information about the second avatar, I will solve it myself." </p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you young humans have no right to intervene in the battle between us."</p><p></p><p>After all, Xuan Sushang was a respected Dao Immortal, but Li Fan kept calling her a junior. However, Xuan Sushang was not angry. Compared to the ancient Tian Xuan Mirror, they were indeed many generations lower. Calling her that was not wrong at all.</p><p></p><p>Instead, Li Fan only needed to provide intelligence and did not require her to take action, which made Xuan Sushang relieved.</p><p></p><p>After a brief contemplation, she transmitted the relevant information to Li Fan using her divine sense.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>"Father, please forgive me." Xuan Sushang silently said in her heart after doing all this.</p><p></p><p>Knowing the whereabouts of the human avatar of the Tian Xuan Mirror, Li Fan was not in a hurry to act.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he turned his gaze to Lu Xichan, who had been keeping her head down without speaking, with a gloomy expression.</p><p></p><p>Sensing Li Fan's gaze, Lu Xichan became even more uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"Master..." Seeing that Li Fan had not spoken for a long time, she finally plucked up the courage to ask tentatively.</p><p></p><p>"Xichan, you have really disappointed me as your master." Li Fan's voice entered her ears, and Lu Xichan's body trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It has been 286 years since I officially passed the position of the head of the Strategy Formation Hall to you. After so many years, your attainment in formations is still like this..."</p><p></p><p>"Master, I..." Upon hearing this, Lu Xichan felt a little aggrieved.</p><p></p><p>When she took over as the head of the Strategy Formation Hall, she only received support from a few elders. The vast majority chose to wait and see, and there were even quite a few who wanted to replace her. It could be said that she was surrounded by crises and had to be cautious with every step. Fortunately, after several years of maneuvering and checks and balances, she finally stood firm.</p><p></p><p>As the head of the Strategy Formation Hall of the Immortal Alliance, the affairs were quite heavy. Not only did she need to deal with the miscellaneous matters reported and summarized by the Strategy Formation Halls of various states, but she also needed to participate in the monthly meetings to discuss the operation of the Immortal Alliance with other departments.</p><p></p><p>In the past two hundred years, except for the previous leakage of the protective formation, the Strategy Formation Hall had basically made no mistakes. It had even made quite a few meritorious deeds.</p><p></p><p>This was inseparable from her painstaking efforts.</p><p></p><p>She had already tried her best to get to where she was today. How could she make further progress in formations?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, her formation skills had indeed improved, just without any major breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan was conflicted and was about to explain for herself.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan rudely interrupted, "I know what you are thinking, but only the weak make excuses for themselves."</p><p></p><p>"True powerhouses, even if they are always on the brink of life and death, will never give up the pursuit of the Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan asked in a deep voice, "Search your conscience, have you really tried your best?!"</p><p></p><p>"I..." Lu Xichan was instantly at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan added more emphasis, "Not striving to improve, but indulging in female charms instead..."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Li Fan glanced at Xuan Sushang beside him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at Lu Xichan again, "Punishment is due!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a long whip condensed from divine soul power appeared in his hand. Li Fan shouted angrily, "Kneel down!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan was now a He-</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Daoist cultivators, the chief strategist of the Immortal Alliance, held a high position and wielded great authority.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, he had his own pride and arrogance. With his head held high, he was about to open his mouth to defy.</p><p></p><p>However, he came face to face with Li Fan's cold and ruthless gaze.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless childhood memories surged into his mind.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if he had returned to that childhood where he lived in fear every day, afraid of being scolded by his master. Lu Xichan's legs softened, and he actually followed his body's instinct and bent his knees to kneel down!</p><p></p><p>Kneeling on the cold ground, the fear that Lu Xichan had just felt disappeared. Instead, a nameless fire of rebellion suddenly surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Before this flame could grow, Lu Xichan saw a golden whip shadow whistling and flying towards him from the front.</p><p></p><p>"Don't dodge!"</p><p></p><p>The instinctive defense was stopped by Li Fan's gloomy shout.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Lu Xichan could only watch helplessly as the golden spirit whip struck his own spirit.</p><p></p><p>The point of impact was precisely the area where the defensive prohibition had been washed away by the spirit previously. A sense of pain that could not be described in words instantly spread throughout his entire body.</p><p></p><p>It was like countless steel needles were forcefully rotating and piercing into his body and brain. In an instant, all of Lu Xichan's consciousness was filled with a sense of pain.</p><p></p><p>His body first stiffened violently, then fell to the ground, twitching incessantly.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't even let out a wail, only making intermittent whimpers from his throat.</p><p></p><p>His body twisted and curled up. It took a full half a cup of tea's time for the pain originating from the depths of his spirit to slowly subside.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan, who had regained a bit of consciousness, was about to open his mouth to beg for mercy.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan had no pity or tenderness. With another whip, he struck directly at the spirit!</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan, who had just escaped not long ago, was instantly pulled back into hell!</p><p></p><p>This time, Lu Xichan's reaction was even more intense than before. Tears and mucus flowed across his face, no longer able to maintain his former noble appearance.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Lu Xichan's faint wailing, Xuan Sushang, who had been keeping her head down and not speaking, now also secretly turned her head to look.</p><p></p><p>A trace of unusual color flashed in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Sushang's small movement was already within Li Fan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>For now, he didn't bother with her. When Lu Xichan recovered again, another golden whip was swung down.</p><p></p><p>This time, Lu Xichan made no more howls.</p><p></p><p>Only instinctive sobs and pleas for mercy remained.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Xichan knows her mistake..."</p><p></p><p>"Master, spare my life..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan's cries echoed in this wooden house.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan still had that icy expression that seemed eternal, while Xuan Sushang's face inexplicably turned red and her eyes became dazed.</p><p></p><p>He did not swing the whip a fourth time.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Li Fan held the whip in his right hand behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Waiting for Lu Xichan to regain her senses.</p><p></p><p>This scene of punishment also made Xuan Sushang somewhat frightened. She also didn't dare to move, waiting in place.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Lu Xichan finally awoke from the blankness in her mind.</p><p></p><p>Lying on the ground, seeing Li Fan's towering figure, Lu Xichan instinctively felt a tremor in her heart.</p><p></p><p>After that, she struggled to get up, first tidying up her appearance, and then with difficulty, she bowed her head and paid respects: "Thank you, Master, for the punishment."</p><p></p><p>"Get up." Li Fan responded indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan wanted to stand up but almost fell to the ground again.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xuan Sushang hurriedly stepped forward to support her.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Dao is boundless, pursuing the Dao until death without rest. These three whips are my punishment for your negligence!"</p><p></p><p>"The Dao of formations is like rowing upstream; if you don't advance, you'll fall behind. From now on, stay in this bamboo sea and diligently study the Dao of formations. Don't run around unnecessarily unless it's necessary!"</p>

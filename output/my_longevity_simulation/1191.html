            <p>Chapter 1189: The Formation of the Primordial Golden Elixir (Combined Chapter)</p><p></p><p>"That talisman seems to be able to absorb the power of the wandering True Immortal seal characters. It should be possible to use it as a cover."</p><p></p><p>"However, it's the first time the Broken Immortal Tower has revealed this technique. Even in the [Academy of Proving the Dao], which is known as the source of the Immortal Boat's Dao methods, there are no relevant records."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense gaze suddenly fell on the sleeping Zhao Xian.</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Immortal Boat has a strict hierarchical system. Many people have never even left the continent they are on in their entire lives. A solid fortress still needs to be broken from the inside."</p><p></p><p>With a light point of his divine sense, Li Fan tapped on Zhao Xian's forehead.</p><p></p><p>In a daze, Zhao Xian seemed to have a very long dream.</p><p></p><p>In the dream, the conflict between the Broken Immortal Tower and the Immortal Pivot Court could not be resolved for a long time. The struggle became more and more intense, and the means became more and more extreme. It eventually led to a catastrophic disaster. The Immortal Boat fell into the depths of the Relic Sea and was completely destroyed. No one on the Immortal Boat survived, including Zhao Xian himself.</p><p></p><p>Waking up from the nightmare, the usually optimistic and cheerful Zhao Xian took a long time to recover, his face deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simply that the dream was too real. Zhao Xian could still remember some details in the dream clearly, which made him feel like he had returned to the past.</p><p></p><p>"In the dream, ten years later, the Immortal Boat Salvage Team found a supreme treasure called [Derivation Jade] in the Relic Sea. It could derive different cultivation techniques at all times and could even perform targeted derivation based on conditions. The Broken Immortal Tower and the Immortal Pivot Court fought fiercely for the ownership of the Derivation Jade. In the end, it was temporarily kept by our Academy of Proving the Dao. Although the academy gained an unimaginable number of cultivation techniques during this period, it also laid the groundwork for future troubles."</p><p></p><p>"As an elite disciple of the academy, I was fortunate to have studied some of these techniques in my dream."</p><p></p><p>"[Stabilizing the Sea Divine Sword]..."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian subconsciously operated the contents of the cultivation technique in his dream.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, his expression changed dramatically.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian recalled the contents of even more profound cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>[Supreme Geng Metal Sword Qi], [Emperor's Qi Canon], [Two Qi Illuminating the Gods and Extinguishing All Heavens Technique], [Boundless Celestial Pivot Separation Technique]...</p><p></p><p>One after another, these world-shaking supreme techniques appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Word for word, clear and distinct.</p><p></p><p>The qi circulation brought about by silently reciting these cultivation techniques also made Zhao Xian realize that these were not some imaginary existence, but genuine supreme divine techniques!</p><p></p><p>"These techniques, let alone me, even the entire Academy of Proving the Dao can't derive them..."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian's heart was pounding.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I really came back from the future to the past?"</p><p></p><p>For a full half day, Zhao Xian couldn't accept this reality. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't figure out why such a bizarre thing would happen to him.</p><p></p><p>Since he couldn't figure it out, he stopped thinking about it.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian's thoughts quickly focused on the ending of the Immortal Boat's destruction in his dream.</p><p></p><p>"If that's true..."</p><p></p><p>"I must change all of this." Zhao Xian subconsciously clenched his fists.</p><p></p><p>Having experienced too many cruel things in his dream, the young Zhao Xian had become much more composed. He didn't habitually use [Wanwen Record] to search for what to do, because he knew that his every word and browsing history were all under the monitoring of the Academy of Proving the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian paced back and forth in the room, his mind racing. Since the great dream, he seemed to feel that his thinking had become much more flexible.</p><p></p><p>"Master was right. The Immortal Boat must have, and can only have, one helmsman. But the contradiction between the Broken Immortal Tower and the Immortal Pivot Court is irreconcilable. If they are allowed to fight internally, the destruction of the Immortal Boat is inevitable."</p><p></p><p>"The best method is to cut through the chaos and let one side gain an overwhelming advantage in a short period of time."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian's eyes flashed: "Although some of the details of people and events in the dream are already blurry, the memory of future cultivation techniques and secret arts is very clear. With these data that are decades ahead, I am confident in helping one side unify the Immortal Boat. As for who to help..."</p><p></p><p>After slowly recalling the actions of the two major organizations in the dream, as well as their governing philosophies, Zhao Xian finally decided to choose the Broken Immortal Tower.</p><p></p><p>"Now that the Broken Immortal Tower is just beginning to rise and is in need of people, I only need to show a little talent to easily blend in."</p><p></p><p>"My current strength is still too weak and needs to be improved as soon as possible. Fortunately, there are now too many miraculous cultivation techniques in my mind."</p><p></p><p>"As long as there are enough resources, breaking through two major realms within a year is not a problem."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xian closed his eyes and cultivated quietly, already prepared to shock the Academy of Proving the Dao after coming out of seclusion.</p><p></p><p>What he didn't notice was that by his side, a faint, barely visible figure was gazing at him.</p><p></p><p>This figure was naturally Li Fan's divine sense.</p><p></p><p>"Without the restriction of not being able to cultivate the same techniques, the countless techniques I have seen in the past can all play their greatest value here."</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the perilous Mysterious Yellow Realm, this Immortal Boat is really like a paradise."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who was restricted everywhere in the Mysterious Yellow Realm, was now stirring up trouble on the Mysterious Immortal Boat, but instead felt a sense of exhilaration that his unique techniques could be maximized.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Traversing more than half of the Starry Sea, encountering the Mysterious Immortal Boat civilization hidden in the Relic Ocean, and finally finding a breakthrough and going into hiding.</p><p></p><p>This took the Holy Fetus Li Fan a total of about a year.</p><p></p><p>And because of the different flow rates in various regions of the Starry Sea, in the Mysterious Yellow Realm, only less than half a year had passed.</p><p></p><p>In half a year, the Myriad Immortal Alliance had recovered from the great shock in the Mysterious Yellow Realm that day.</p><p></p><p>The distorted white mist barriers in the world had also returned to their original state.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators' memories of that disaster also gradually became blurred. Everything seemed to have returned to the starting point.</p><p></p><p>And in the subsidiary small world of the Mysterious Yellow Realm, the Great Enlightenment of the Holy Dynasty, the changes in the past six months could be described as changing with each passing day.</p><p></p><p>[Changing with each passing day] was not just a figure of speech. In the sky of the Great Enlightenment of the Holy Dynasty, there really appeared a wonder that could compete with the sun and moon.</p><p></p><p>It was an increasing number of shining stars centered around five blurry halos.</p><p></p><p>And at night, it completely overshadowed the original starlight of the Great Enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>According to folk legends, the five circular halos symbolized the five personal disciples of His Majesty the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>And the stars that appeared one after another around the halos represented the many talents that emerged in the Great Enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>This rumor was not unfounded, but had sufficient basis.</p><p></p><p>Just three days ago, all the subjects of the Great Enlightenment saw with their own eyes that in the sky near the circular halos...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>A shining star suddenly burst forth with hundreds of times its usual radiance. </p><p></p><p>It then transformed into a beam of light, shooting straight towards the Imperial Throne in the Holy Capital.</p><p></p><p>The phenomenon lasted for nearly half a day before the light pillar that pierced through heaven and earth vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, people were astonished to discover that the star in the sky had also disappeared along with it, descending to the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>If disciples of the Holy Emperor could trigger such a miraculous sight, what would the Holy Emperor himself be capable of?</p><p></p><p>Following the upheaval in the world caused by the Holy Emperor's martial arts demonstration half a year ago, people once again began to discuss and speculate about the Holy Emperor's formidable strength, albeit only in private.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the entire Great Qi Empire, the worship and trust in the Holy Emperor had reached an almost unanimous and terrifying level.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the unparalleled Holy Emperor in the hearts of the Great Qi's subjects was furrowing his brows, staring at a white-haired youth sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed before him.</p><p></p><p>Contrary to the rumors circulating among the people, after the beam of light descended from the heavens three days ago, supposedly heralding the arrival of a celestial star, Emperor Li Ping not only didn't feel any pleasant surprise...</p><p></p><p>But instead, due to his unceasing shock, he gave rise to anger and wariness.</p><p></p><p>Because he immediately realized the true nature of the light beam: it was one of the massive cave heavens that Daoist Baihua had painstakingly transported outside the Great Qi's small world, serving to rapidly pull the world through the void...</p><p></p><p>And it had exploded.</p><p></p><p>The culprit responsible for this incident was right here in the Great Qi, in this very Holy Capital!</p><p></p><p>However, prior to this, Li Ping had been completely unaware of this matter! How could he, who proclaimed himself as the Emperor of Heavenly Mandate, accept this?</p><p></p><p>In the past half year, while the Myriad Immortal Alliance was busy quelling disasters and comforting the people, Daoist Baihua worked day and night without rest, fiercely transporting some cave heavens here from the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because the shock waves from that starry sea had shaken the Xuanhuang Realm, making it much easier for Baihua to transport these cave heavens. Even so, working tirelessly for half a year had nearly exhausted Baihua. Unable to endure any longer, he had hidden himself in the Five Elements Cave Heaven to recuperate from his injuries.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that a calamity of a cave heaven being destroyed would occur?</p><p></p><p>Daoist Baihua's face turned extremely unsightly. Disregarding his injuries, he immediately ran out from the Five Elements Cave Heaven.</p><p></p><p>By this time, Li Fan had also locked onto the true culprit behind this matter.</p><p></p><p>Before he could confront them, a single sentence from Daoist Yin Shangren caused his shock to turn into joy, and his anger completely dissipated!</p><p></p><p>"Successfully cultivated the [Primordial Golden Core]!"</p><p></p><p>Even the Holy Emperor, upon hearing this sentence from Daoist Yin Shangren, couldn't help but be greatly shaken in his mind and momentarily lose focus.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Golden Core, as the realm following [Establishing Foundation with Self], was a part of the New New Law and an important component in Li Ping's plan to overturn the Celestial Venerable's cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>This first step was especially difficult to take. Once taken, it would inevitably bring about many unimaginable changes.</p><p></p><p>When Li Ping had summoned Daoist Yin Shangren to the Great Qi to research the New New Law, he actually didn't have high expectations in his heart. It was completely done with a mindset of just giving it a try.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Celestial Venerable's new cultivation system had stood undefeated for tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>How could it be easy to destroy its foundation?</p><p></p><p>Li Ping had anticipated that the development of the New New Law would take at least ten or a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that just over half a year later, Daoist Yin Shangren would give him such a big surprise.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, doubts and wariness arose in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>He didn't start asking questions but shifted his gaze from the black-haired youth to Daoist Yin Shangren, waiting for his explanation.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Yin Shangren paid no attention to Li Ping and only looked at the youth who was cultivating, lost in admiration.</p><p></p><p>"The aura of the world..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's eyes slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>The black-haired youth gave him a very strange feeling.</p><p></p><p>He was indeed one of the several children who had established their foundation through self-cultivation, and now he had indeed completed a breakthrough in his realm.</p><p></p><p>That fluctuating and elusive strength made Li Ping feel a bit difficult to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>However, the youth's life force was far too weak.</p><p></p><p>It didn't resemble the vigorous state after a breakthrough in realm at all. Instead, it was like a dying candle in the wind, on the verge of being extinguished.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that his life would completely vanish in the next second.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, seeing the pained expression on the black-haired youth's face, Daoist Yin Shangren let out a long sigh: "To seize the world's fortune with one's body..."</p><p></p><p>"How difficult it is! Although he has achieved the Primordial Golden Core, he suffers a backlash. If he can't endure it, the only path is the destruction of both body and soul."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping automatically skipped over the latter half of the sentence and focused his attention on the first part of what Daoist Yin Shangren said.</p><p></p><p>"Seizing the world's fortune with one's body? Is this the key to cultivating the Primordial Golden Core?" Li Ping asked.</p><p></p><p>"The New New Law shouldn't follow this path."</p><p></p><p>Daoist Yin Shangren described to Li Fan the process of comprehending the Primordial Golden Core under this fortuitous encounter.</p><p></p><p>"What is primordial?"</p><p></p><p>"Establishing foundation with self means using one's complete self to build the foundation for cultivation. If a person in the world wants to go a step further, they need to seek answers from the world and heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"Seizing the world's fortune with one's body is not directly devouring heaven and earth like the Celestial Venerable's new law..."</p><p></p><p>"Although the actual effect is pretty much the same." Daoist Yin Shangren suddenly said, abruptly stopping his words.</p><p></p><p>Looking up at the remnants of the disappeared cave heaven in the sky, Daoist Yin Shangren then continued, "Achieving the primordial is not seizing concrete matter or energy, but seizing the world's [fortune]."</p><p></p><p>"The Great Dao has fifty, and the Heavenly Evolution forty-nine. Because of the one that has escaped, the world has additional variables, allowing heaven and earth to maintain endless vitality even after countless years."</p><p></p><p>"But if that escaped one is seized..."</p><p></p><p>"The beam of light in heaven and earth just now is their fate."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, part of the reason is also due to my intervention. Without external interference, it would probably take nearly a hundred years for the changes to manifest. I did it to help this child. Otherwise, with a foundation-establishing body, if he dared to greedily seize heaven and earth, even if it was just a cave heaven, his consciousness would be lost in the struggle within the cave heaven's world." Daoist Yin Shangren glanced at Li Ping, showing no intention of apologizing.</p><p></p><p>"To be able to think of what I couldn't, this kid is indeed remarkable."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>From Daoist Yin Shangren's words, Li Ping also vaguely understood this so-called [Primordial Golden Core].</p><p></p><p>As the lord of the Great Qi world, having closely observed and interacted with many small worlds, he could better understand the meaning behind Daoist Yin Shangren's words.</p><p></p><p>"The world is like a human body. The idea of seizing the world's fortune to achieve one's own Primordial Golden Core is indeed feasible."</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping pondered for a moment and inwardly shook his head in disapproval.</p><p></p><p>"This step is too big of a leap!"</p><p></p><p>"Using a human body to devour the world, even I may not be able to accomplish it."</p><p></p><p>"The New New Law should be a universal method that anyone can cultivate."</p>

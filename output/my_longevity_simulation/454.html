        <h1>Chapter 454</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The overwhelming force of the surging earth veins coming from ten thousand miles away all flowed into Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan seemed to faintly hear, from inside his body, the sound of collisions reverberating.</p><p>In the midst of this mutual struggle, it seemed like something was slowly shattering.</p><p>He seemed to hear a crisp cracking sound in his ear.</p><p></p><p>After a moment,</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's cultivation surged forward all the way, his momentum continuously rising. In the blink of an eye, he had just broken through the middle stage of the Golden Elixir realm and was advancing towards the late stage of the Golden Elixir realm.</p><p></p><p>And then...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Fan felt the previously somewhat bright seabed completely darken.</p><p>Not just darkness in his vision.</p><p>It was a sense of confinement in the sealed space.</p><p></p><p>Without pausing his devouring action, Li Fan also looked up.</p><p></p><p>He saw a giant palm that had appeared above his head at some point.</p><p>Shrouding everything and pressing down.</p><p></p><p>Before the massive hand, Li Fan seemed as small as an ant.</p><p></p><p>"Damn!"</p><p>Watching this unfathomable power that appeared out of nowhere, Li Fan cursed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>However, his doppelganger was currently using the "Devouring Heaven and Earth Great Law," feeling as fearless as if he had eaten lion hearts and leopard gallbladders when facing this terrifying giant palm.</p><p></p><p>Instead of being afraid, he even opened his mouth, wanting to swallow this giant palm!</p><p></p><p>The result was...</p><p></p><p>Naturally unquestionable.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Li Fan lost contact with his doppelganger.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the unexpected entity did not seem to have any intention of investigating further.</p><p>Without tracing to the root and finding Li Fan's true body, otherwise, he would perhaps have to face the consequences once again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully recalled the timing of the appearance of the giant hand.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that it was because I forcefully broke through the Heavenly Calamity?"</p><p>"Is it a countermeasure of Heaven and Earth, or..."</p><p></p><p>Slightly frowning, a blue light burst from the crystalline pathway in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>In the split second before the doppelganger was crushed, he had indeed absorbed a trace of energy from that giant hand using the "Devouring Heaven and Earth Great Law."</p><p></p><p>If the other party were a cultivator, undoubtedly Li Fan would not have been able to achieve this.</p><p>Continuously contemplating the taste of that strand of energy, Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"It seems more like the force of pure rules."</p><p>"In this case, it seems somewhat similar to Senior Brother Zhang's Law Avatar."</p><p>"It usually doesn't appear in the world and will only act under specific circumstances..."</p><p></p><p>"I had originally planned to use the 'Devouring Heaven and Earth Great Law' to enhance the cultivation of the doppelganger, advancing it to the late stage of the Golden Elixir realm, accumulating experience to breakthrough the Nascent Soul stage. Who knew it would encounter such unexpected calamity."</p><p></p><p>"It's fortunate that it was just the doppelganger."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed inwardly, already accustomed to the dangers in the Mysterious Yellow World.</p><p></p><p>Quietly leaving the Immortal Island, finding a secluded place, he spent some time then conjured up "Zhou Qing'ang" once again.</p><p></p><p>The doppelganger nodded slightly, bid farewell to the original body, and hurried towards the location of the incident.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see how the oceanic area that had just experienced the palm strike from the sky would look like now.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, Li Fan returned to the scene.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, the sea was calm, the sky was clear with a gentle breeze.</p><p>There seemed to be no sign of disaster that had occurred just now.</p><p></p><p>It all appeared as if it was just his illusion.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a while and dived into the sea.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the underwater scenery clearly, his pupils suddenly contracted.</p><p>The original submerged ruins of the island were no longer there.</p><p>It was not merely destruction, but more like erasing all traces of existence!</p><p></p><p>After a deep gaze, Zhou Qing'ang returned calmly to Tai'an Island without any reaction.</p><p></p><p>In the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p>With the help of the doppelganger's eyes, Li Fan observed the aftermath of the giant palm strike, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Because I forcibly broke through the Heavenly Calamity, perhaps I triggered some taboo, hence the erasure?"</p><p>"And everything happened so silently..."</p><p></p><p>"What if I manage to survive that palm strike?"</p><p>"Will that eliminate the bottleneck? Of course, it may also attract even more terrifying entities."</p><p></p><p>The thought of courting death only lasted a moment before Li Fan dismissed it.</p><p></p><p>"However, in the previous life, after some time, the Heavenly Calamity mysteriously disappeared on its own for unknown reasons."</p><p></p><p>After the suppression by the suddenly appearing giant hand, Li Fan gave up on the idea of letting the doppelganger cultivate as well.</p><p>He decided to be a straightforward tool, only daring to sacrifice himself at crucial moments.</p><p></p><p>Since the attempt to gain insight into the Nascent Soul stage through the doppelganger failed, Li Fan could only resort to buying relevant experience summaries from the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Every individual's insights were different, but each had its validity, without much distinction between them.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had deep pockets and purchased them all for careful study.</p><p></p><p>As time passed slowly with Li Fan cultivating and reflecting, it soon came to the agreed time for the second round of investment with He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>Due to the successful start last time, He Zhenghao's gains this time weren't bad, collecting a total of five hundred and fifty thousand contribution points.</p><p></p><p>After confirming with Li Fan, He Zhenghao immediately transferred the contribution points over.</p><p></p><p>And he also added his personal one hundred thousand contribution points.</p><p></p><p>"One million contribution points after a year." Li Fan succinctly stated.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was overjoyed, a string of compliments poured out of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was too lazy to listen and directly ended the communication.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he checked the list of participants in this fundraising.</p><p></p><p>"It's interesting, they have so much confidence in me? Aren't they afraid I might take the money and run?"</p><p>"And individuals like He Zhenghao, who are Foundation Establishment cultivators, where did they get so many contribution points from?"</p><p></p><p>This person had been mentioned occasionally by He Zhenghao in a past life.</p><p>He was a good friend who often discussed investment strategies with him.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly having a close relationship with a certain cultivator from the Heavenly Secrets Hall, he was well-informed, often leading everyone to make a small profit.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in their little group, he carried some authority.</p><p></p><p>In the previous lives, this person had made several significant contributions to He Zhenghao's attempt to speculate on the Spirit Veil Grass.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, no matter what the trick is, I'm not afraid. Let's just watch how it unfolds."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at his remaining balance of over six million contribution points and chuckled to himself.</p><p></p><p>With so many contribution points, he could rip off some people again.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Spirit Veil Grass incident was approaching.</p><p>These contribution points would multiply several times.</p><p></p><p>"The only concern is that with such a large volume of transactions, it's inevitable to attract the attention of those with ill intentions."</p><p></p><p>"It's time to see how Tianyang Junior Brother is recovering."</p><p></p><p>With these thoughts in mind, Li Fan quietly entered his Dao incarnation.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang was calmly absorbing energy in the formation to repair himself.</p><p></p><p>There was no sign of defense at Li Fan's arrival.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan checked the progress.</p><p></p><p>"It's getting close."</p><p>"In the Misty Cloud Sea, there should be no problems with the Nascent Soul cultivation."</p><p>"But once we leave the Misty Cloud Sea, it might not be enough."</p><p></p><p>"Scorching Flame Sea..."</p><p>Li Fan looked at Tianyang, and a hint of hesitation flashed in his eyes.</p>

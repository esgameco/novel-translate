        <h1>Chapter 1297</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1291: Remnant Souls of Lingering Thoughts (7K words)</p><p></p><p>The intent transmitted from the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao was not entirely clear, but Holy Emperor Li Ping had already roughly understood what It wanted to express. üçë ‚ãÜ üç≠üéÄùü®ùü´ùìàùíΩùìäùìç.ùí∏‚òØùìÇüéÄüç≠ ‚ãÜ üçë</p><p></p><p>"The position of Great Heavenly Venerate..."</p><p></p><p>"Could lose the connection with me?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping furrowed his brows and couldn't help but fall into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"For thousands of years, no new Xuanhuang Great Heavenly Venerate has taken office. Why at this time... who could it be?" The Holy Emperor sensed a hint of conspiracy. The Holy Emperor could now only monitor a small part of the Xuanhuang Realm, with the vast majority of areas in blind spots. Faces flashed rapidly through his mind, but he was unable to lock onto a suspect worthy of suspicion.</p><p></p><p>"Although theoretically speaking, one who can pass the Great Heavenly Venerate trial should stand on my side and face the Dharma Transmission together. But..."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor reassured the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao while showing a resolute look in his eyes: "It seems the plan needs to be moved up."</p><p></p><p>"As long as we can force out the Dharma Transmission when the star sea anomaly arrives."</p><p></p><p>A ray of starlight flew out from the Holy Emperor's seat. </p><p></p><p>The Sage Dynasty's long-prepared war machine began to rapidly operate.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang, who was conducting final tests on the protective abilities of the Sage Army puppets, was a bit surprised to receive the Holy Emperor's edict. But seeing the chessboard-like array of puppets stretching as far as the eye could see in the testing grounds, he quickly became excited and impatient.</p><p></p><p>"Raising an army for a thousand days, using it for a moment. It's time to let the decaying Myriad Immortal Alliance witness the elite troops of the great Sage Dynasty!"</p><p></p><p>About to leave to handle expedition matters, Sun Erlang seemed to remember something and flashed to the deepest part of the testing ground.</p><p></p><p>The surging earth vein power was as thick as substance. Seemingly pounded and squeezed by some great force, the originally earthy yellow color had now turned lava-like crimson red. The earth veins howled as they flowed, beating against a black adamantine stone in the center.</p><p></p><p>No matter how the crimson earth veins raged, the adamantine stone always stood firm and unmoving. In fact, with each strike of the crimson earth veins, the luster on the stone became even more dazzling.</p><p></p><p>Above the black adamantine stone, a beam of starlight shone down from a continuously rotating star vortex, illuminating the stone.</p><p></p><p>Under the starlight, the black stone seemed to breathe. With continuous inhalation and exhalation, specks of starlight were absorbed into it.</p><p></p><p>The Ingenious Monk was floating in midair not far away, intently staring at the black adamantine stone amidst this strange scene. At the same time, he seemed to be constantly calculating something, controlling and allocating the ratio of power between the incoming earth veins and starlight.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Ingenious, the great war may start early. Senior Tianyang, he..."</p><p></p><p>The Ingenious Monk seemed to have also received the edict. Without taking his eyes off Tianyang's body, he said indifferently: "Don't worry. When the time comes, I will definitely give the Myriad Immortal Alliance a big surprise. Those bastards have swallowed quite a bit of my source power in recent years..."</p><p></p><p>"Right! Since the great war is coming, we can make use of those Tianling Sect wastes too." The Ingenious Monk patted his head, then after reporting to the Holy Emperor with closed eyes, he sent out another order floating towards the puppets in Jiushan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>A hint of complacency flashed in his eyes as the Ingenious Monk's attention returned to Tianyang's body undergoing the dual tempering of earth vein torrents and star sea power.</p><p></p><p>The Ingenious Monk could very clearly sense the vast power gestating within this black adamantine stone.</p><p></p><p>His body trembled slightly as a hint of madness flashed in his eyes: "This puppet is the pinnacle of my forging art. Even in the former Tianji Realm, no one could surpass it. Shangguan, you just watch closely. The disciple you neglected will fiercely surpass you..."</p><p></p><p>The Ingenious Monk ignored Sun Erlang who was still beside him and muttered to himself. His hands occasionally sent out spell seals floating onto Tianyang's body.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Sun Erlang tactfully retreated.</p><p></p><p>As the military and people of the Great Qi urgently prepared for war, there were two people in the Sage Dynasty who had already leisurely left the small world and returned to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than Xu Ke and Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren squinted his eyes and looked up at the sky, seeming a bit unaccustomed to the sunlight of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>They were to infiltrate the Museum of Divine Treasures one step ahead before the great war began.</p><p></p><p>"This Emperor San Mao is quite interesting. He's clearly one of the Three Beast Emperors, yet he joined a human cultivation sect; in the face of great calamity, he unhesitatingly chose to defect and join the New New Myriad Immortal Alliance..." Yin Shangren said with a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke shook his head and explained: "Third Grandpa is mysterious and unfathomable. No one can figure out what he's thinking. After all, not following Emperor Yi in leaving the Xuanhuang Realm back then was already a bit incomprehensible. Besides, his actions can't really be considered a betrayal of the Beast Taming Sect. Nearly the entire Beast Taming Sect relied on the dharma methods he brought to flourish in the first place. He has grace for the Beast Taming Sect, not the other way around."</p><p></p><p>"Defecting to the Myriad Immortal Alliance, I think it may still be for the sake of survival."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren sneered: "I don't care about the rest, but if he pops out to stop me when I'm taking Bai's skull, I won't be polite... As for you, you won't turn against us when the time comes, right?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke said solemnly: "Rest assured, fellow Daoist. I've already made arrangements in advance, sending Qing and Hong to the Lingxu Realm. Imitating the Beast Taming Dharma Wheel, plus the cooperation of the current Beast Taming Sect, it should be able to lure Third Grandpa away. Taking a step back, even if the scheme fails..."</p><p></p><p>"I won't hold back either."</p><p></p><p>"That's good then." Having obtained Xu Ke's assurance, Yin Shangren smiled and his expression returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>The two proceeded according to plan, sneaking all the way to the vicinity of Tiancheng in Tianyu Prefecture of the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"It should be here, the Heng family of Tianyu Prefecture." Xu Ke observed while surveying the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"I say, we could just find any family with access to the Museum of Divine Treasures. Why bother coming all the way here?" Yin Shangren rubbed his scalp, a bit impatient.</p><p></p><p>"The original plan was like that. But the Holy Emperor suddenly sent a message earlier, saying that something seemed to have changed on the Myriad Immortal Alliance's side. The entry and exit management of the alliance headquarters suddenly became strict. In that case, there aren't many cultivators left who still have access to the Divine Treasury. Among them, the Heng family of Tianyu Prefecture is the most suitable target."</p><p></p><p>"The family is illustrious, all because of their weaving dharma abilities. Their strength isn't too great, and they also keep a low profile, having a relatively low presence in the public mind..." Xu Ke explained through voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's gaze penetrated the Heng family's protection as a hint of a cold smile appeared: "The best to strike should be those two little girls, right? They're even a mother-daughter pair..."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it's them, Heng Ruoshui and He Xinxin. As long as we wait for them to go out, capture them and swap their identities."</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Emperor instructed not to harm people unless necessary," Xu Ke added.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren: "Don't worry, these delicate ones don't suit my taste anyway. Just, the two of us have to turn into women? Can we change targets?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke sneered: "You're still hung up on the appearance of this skin? "</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren waved his hand: "I suppose so. Too lazy to run around, let's quickly get this over with. I'm a bit impatient to see Bai's skull."</p><p></p><p>The Heng mother and daughter didn't keep the two waiting for long.</p><p></p><p>A day later, He Xinxin slipped out to play and was silently taken down by the two.</p><p></p><p>Another two days later, Heng Ruoshui seemed to have received an invitation and left her cave abode. She was also captured by the two in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Heng mother and daughter tied together and in a deep sleep, Yin Shangren stroked his chin: "The dharma method bestowed by the Holy Emperor is indeed useful. The dharma text compass within this little girl's body is quite extraordinary. It has the ability to seek fortune and avoid misfortune, to extrapolate and predict. It can be considered half a piece of a Heavenly Wonder, perhaps an ancient immortal artifact reborn after dissipation..."</p><p></p><p>"Yet with the 'Single Hand Covering the Sky' secret art granted by the Holy Emperor, this little girl was completely unaware of the impending crisis."</p><p></p><p>Taking a drop of essence blood from the foreheads of the Heng mother and daughter.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke took it and pressed it between his brows.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren was much more crude, opening a slit in his scalp and having his true self foundation devour it.</p><p></p><p>With a rustle of flesh and blood surging, in the blink of an eye, Xu Ke and Yin Shangren had respectively transformed into the appearances of Heng Ruoshui and He Xinxin.</p><p></p><p>Appearance, aura, and even soul fluctuations were almost completely identical.</p><p></p><p>"The wondrous methods passed down by the Sage Dynasty are indeed extraordinary." Xu Ke showed a hint of shock in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren closed his eyes and comprehended: "The self that follows the heart is the true self. Endless transformations, unfathomable to gods and ghosts..."</p><p></p><p>After hiding the mother and daughter and completing their disguises, Xu Ke and Yin Shangren flew towards Tiancheng of Tianyu.</p><p></p><p>For cultivators to apply to visit the "Museum of Divine Treasures", they need to go through the local government office to submit an application to the Myriad Immortal Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>Only after the Myriad Immortal Alliance headquarters approves can a dedicated guide cultivator come to lead them in.</p><p></p><p>In Tianyu Prefecture, Heng Ruoshui's face was the best pass.</p><p></p><p>And taking a junior family member to visit the Museum of Divine Treasures was also a perfectly normal thing to do.</p><p></p><p>The application was sent to the Myriad Immortal Alliance headquarters without any obstacles.</p><p></p><p>The response efficiency of the Myriad Immortal Alliance headquarters wasn't as swift. It wasn't until seven days later that a final response came.</p><p></p><p>The dignitaries of Tianyu Prefecture seemed utterly insignificant before the Myriad Immortal Alliance guide cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed guide cultivator indifferently instructed a few things to note when entering the alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>He brought the two to the Tianshu Prefecture's Tiancheng surrounding the central alliance headquarters, then opened a teleportation gate to the headquarters in a room deep within the government office.</p><p></p><p>Stepping into the light formation, rolling illusions came flooding in.</p><p></p><p>Even with Yin Shangren and Xu Ke's current cultivation, they couldn't stop it.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Ke recovered in just an instant. Because the Heng Ruoshui he was impersonating had come to the alliance headquarters before.</p><p></p><p>As for Yin Shangren impersonating He Xinxin, his body trembled slightly before opening his eyes a moment later.</p><p></p><p>The guide cultivator introduced the reason for the illusions as per usual, then casually asked: "What did you see?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren replied as the Holy Emperor had instructed: "The Heavenly Venerate's dharma appearance, reaching the sky and standing on the earth, preaching the Dao to all beings."</p><p></p><p>The guide cultivator nodded and didn't ask further.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren: "Interesting. I saw the Dharma Transmitter's figure, floating outside the Xuanhuang Realm. A bird's-eye view, looking down at Xuanhuang. The Xuanhuang Realm was far from its current size, it should be a scene not long after the Dharma Transmitter attained the Dao and eternal life."</p><p></p><p>"What did you see?" Yin Shangren asked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke immediately transmitted an image.</p><p></p><p>As if in the chaotic void, unable to discern the specific location.</p><p></p><p>Two figures faced each other, their appearances unclear.</p><p></p><p>"You are?"</p><p></p><p>"I am you."</p><p></p><p>"You are me..." The voice was a bit hesitant.</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, slowly shaking his head: "No. You and I... are different."</p><p></p><p>The other voice laughed, a hint of mockery: "This is your destined mission. You cannot refuse. Face reality, sooner or later, we will eventually merge into one."</p><p></p><p>"I said, I am Xuanyuan Tuo. Not..."</p><p></p><p>At the crucial point, the image shattered with a boom.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren was stunned for a moment and inadvertently glanced at Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke was also a bit helpless: "I only saw this much too. The key part afterwards is indeed missing."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren watched this segment again: "Quite interesting. We need to tell this information to the Holy Emperor when we return. He should know something."</p><p></p><p>While the two were communicating, they quickly arrived before the Museum of Divine Treasures.</p><p></p><p>Towering on a floating continent, all black, solemn and majestic.</p><p></p><p>The tall and narrow door made every cultivator who came to visit</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but feel a sense of respect.</p><p></p><p>After going through identity verification again, the guide priest led the two into the inner part of the Divine Treasury.</p><p></p><p>The first mandatory stop was the huge sphere of light called "The Good Times". </p><p></p><p>Within the sphere of light, countless worlds seemed to be born and perish.</p><p></p><p>"This is 'The Times'," the guide priest introduced skillfully.</p><p></p><p>"With a piece of Dao-transforming stone as the core, it derives and concretizes scenes from various periods in the history of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"In all the derived worlds, the survival rate of cultivators is far lower than it is now."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren and Xu Ke were both unconvinced, but couldn't show it, so they just nodded silently.</p><p></p><p>"As per custom, you two can experience it personally."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, experiencing a lifetime in The Times is but an instant in reality. And under normal circumstances, you won't survive more than a few years in the illusion of The Times."</p><p></p><p>Under the operation of the black-robed guide priest, Yin Shangren and Xu Ke each injected a divine sense and flew into the sphere of light of The Times.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the expression of the guide priest couldn't help but become a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>Because the situation he anticipated did not occur.</p><p></p><p>One was immersed in the ancient immortal cultivation era, while the other was immersed in an absolutely chaotic killing world.</p><p></p><p>But one was quite lucky. Not only did he step onto the immortal path from a young age, he also had repeated fortuitous encounters. He smoothly cultivated to the Deity Transformation stage and became a core disciple of an immortal sect. In the end, he passed away at the end of his lifespan.</p><p></p><p>The other was even more a bit outrageous. In the chaotic world, she carved out a bloody path. She became a demoness that struck fear in everyone who heard her name, and even liked to devour the souls of cultivators raw... until she committed too many evil deeds and cultivators of the world could no longer tolerate it, so they united. Only then did she die under the siege.</p><p></p><p>"The other eras seem to be not bad either," they said, feeling a bit unsatisfied after waking up from the illusion of The Times.</p><p></p><p>The guide priest was stunned for a moment, then checked the information of the two again.</p><p></p><p>Heng Ruoshui, He Xinxin.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect this little girl to be so brutal at such a young age."</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to persuade the two to continue the journey through The Times to prove the "good times",</p><p></p><p>the two had already impatiently walked out of The Times.</p><p></p><p>The guide priest wanted to say something but stopped. In the end, he didn't bring this up again.</p><p></p><p>Next, he led the two to visit different areas such as Heroes in Arrogance, Vast Seas Mulberry Fields, and Myriad Techniques Contend.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren suddenly said, "Next, we want to look around by ourselves, is that okay?"</p><p></p><p>He had an impatient look.</p><p></p><p>The guide priest nodded. In any case, his task was already completed, so he handed over a jade tablet: "When you finish the tour and want to leave, just contact me. Remember, keep quiet inside the Divine Treasury..."</p><p></p><p>After giving some reminders, the guide priest disappeared in front of the two.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke and Yin Shangren looked at each other, and with tacit understanding, they slowly moved towards the central location of the Divine Treasury while touring.</p><p></p><p>After a good while, they finally saw from afar that skull quietly placed there.</p><p></p><p>And Yin Shangren also put in a great deal of effort to not show any abnormality.</p><p></p><p>Walking to the front of Mr. Bai's skull, he stared at it quietly.</p><p></p><p>"I can barely resist the urge to take action."</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait. The Immortal Alliance and the Holy Dynasty haven't started fighting yet. More importantly, I can vaguely sense that Grandpa San is still staying in the museum. Anyway, with the authority level of these two from the Heng family, there's no time limit for visiting..."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren didn't reply, but was already immersed in observing Mr. Bai's skull.</p><p></p><p>Unknown how much time passed, another figure came to the vicinity of the skull.</p><p></p><p>Gazing for a long time, he let out a light sigh.</p><p></p><p>This instantly attracted the attention of Xu Ke and Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was a middle-aged long-bearded cultivator. Looking at Mr. Bai's skull, just like them, his emotions were a bit excitedly uncontrollable.</p><p></p><p>"So it's this kid..." Yin Shangren snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>"You know him?" Xu Ke asked.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, his name is Shangguan Shiquan. Back then, he competed with me for Mr. Bai's rib. Speaking of which, Mr. Bai still has a leg bone with him..." Yin Shangren said in an unfriendly tone.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, after retrieving the most important skull, the remaining parts also need to be reclaimed one by one." Xu Ke's eyes also flashed with a dangerous look.</p><p></p><p>"That's natural." Yin Shangren very much agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, what's so good to look at here? I still want to see the ancient magic treasures from earlier..." A slightly childish voice came from afar.</p><p></p><p>It was a little girl about three or four years old. She walked to Shangguan Shiquan's side and pulled at him, crying.</p><p></p><p>"This one ah, is one of the greatest cultivators in the history of the Xuanhuang Realm." Shangguan Shiquan picked up the little girl and comforted her.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the little girl couldn't help but widen her eyes curiously and stare intently at the skull in front.</p><p></p><p>And after hearing Shangguan Shiquan's words, the attitudes of Yin Shangren and Xu Ke had some change.</p><p></p><p>After a quiet moment, that little girl suddenly pointed at Mr. Bai's skull in surprise and shouted, "Grandpa, look quickly, there's someone there!"</p><p></p><p>Like a thunderclap, it instantly exploded in the hearts of the three present.</p><p></p><p>The gazes of the three instantly locked onto the skull again.</p><p></p><p>But it was still completely quiet, where was there the slightest sign of life?</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Shiquan patted the little girl's head: "Nannan, don't talk nonsense, where is there anyone!"</p><p></p><p>The little girl's words were too serious, making Shangguan Shiquan hesitate upon hearing them.</p><p></p><p>He observed carefully again.</p><p></p><p>Still no discoveries. Shangguan Shiquan inwardly mocked himself. He didn't know how many times he had come to see this skull, so how could anyone possibly hide inside?</p><p></p><p>Thinking it was just childish prattle, Shangguan Shiquan told the little girl not to make a fuss.</p><p></p><p>But the little girl was persistent and kept shouting.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Shiquan had no choice but to take the little girl and temporarily leave here.</p><p></p><p>Near the skull, it was once again only Yin Shangren and Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke said in a deep voice, "What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>He was obviously asking about the little girl's words just now.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible. I'm very certain that Mr. Bai has indeed completely fallen. There's absolutely none of his will left on this skull."</p><p></p><p>"Besides, Emperor San Mao is no ordinary figure. He wouldn't be unable to tell if there are remnants of will left in the skull. If there really were, how could he openly display it here for us to see? Hmph, that's the remnant will of the Xuanhuang Great Venerable..."</p><p></p><p>After being silent for a while, Yin Shangren answered with some decisiveness.</p><p></p><p>"But..." Xu Ke stared at Mr. Bai's skull, a trace of doubt flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Before that little girl said it, I hadn't noticed. But after she said that, I really do feel like something is hidden inside this skull."</p><p></p><p>"Not Mr. Bai's remnant will, but something else..."</p><p></p><p>"When I was young, I liked to play hide-and-seek with my companions. As long as Mr. Bai was there, we all liked to hide by his side. He was like he could accommodate the entire world. As long as you were near him, it would be very hard for others to find you..." Xu Ke muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Those words made Yin Shangren also somewhat hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"Right, that guide priest from earlier had said that a remnant soul had once escaped from The Times. Its whereabouts were unknown in the end..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..." Xu Ke suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"The remnant soul from The Times?" Yin Shangren narrowed his eyes and stared at Mr. Bai's skull.</p><p></p><p>"We've been here too long. Let's go somewhere else first." Instead of answering, he said this first.</p><p></p><p>Walking to the exhibition area called "The Appearances of All Beings", only then did Yin Shangren say:</p><p></p><p>"Although Mr. Bai's remains look no different from ordinary human bones, they are after all the bones of the former Great Venerable, so they must have their unique characteristics."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that such special points are hard to distinguish. I once sewed together and raised a mutated human-hand dog. It was very averse to any bones. The only thing it was particularly fond of was that white rib I collected..."</p><p></p><p>"It was as if that was something that could save it from perils." Yin Shangren seemed to recall something and said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke's heart stirred and he said, "In that case, perhaps Mr. Bai's skull really has a way to shelter that remnant soul. It's just that we still can't figure out the truth."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke nodded in agreement, then suddenly said, "Speaking of which, even we couldn't detect the remnant soul hidden in the skull. But that little girl noticed it..."</p><p></p><p>"This little one is no simple character. What was her name again? Shangguan Nihong? After returning, we must report this matter to the Holy Emperor..."</p><p></p><p>If Li Fan were here and could hear the conversation between the two, he would definitely guess that the power of Mr. Bai's skull to shelter the remnant soul from The Times should be the "Eternal Remnant Will" that has fatal attraction to "Huan Zhen".</p><p></p><p>This energy that is currently unknown to the cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm and can only be absorbed and utilized by Huan Zhen is the fundamental reason he sought Mr. Bai's skull by all means.</p><p></p><p>It's just that in this life, the Holy Emperor severed the connection between him and the True Body in the Starry Sea.</p><p></p><p>Even if Yin Shangren and Xu Ke conveyed their findings to the Holy Emperor, Li Fan was destined to be unable to know.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While the two of them were visiting the Divine Treasury Museum,</p><p></p><p>an unusual aura had gradually begun to spread over the territory of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Because Li Fan's avatar had previously infiltrated the Great Earth Cavern with Sun Tianci and stolen nearly one-fifth of the foundation from the bodies of the slumbering cultivators, the high-level figures of the Immortal Alliance were extremely furious.</p><p></p><p>They secretly began a large-scale investigation.</p><p></p><p>Without stating the reason, they examined all the cultivators who appeared in Tong Yan State that day.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Immortal Wall was destined to be kept in the dark, so it could only be investigated in private.</p><p></p><p>But the opaque investigation was bound to lead to unease among the people.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Immortal Alliance had various opinions, and under the instigation of spies from the Holy Dynasty, rumors about the Myriad Immortals Alliance going to war with the Five Elders Society became more and more intense.</p><p></p><p>Just as the situation was getting more and more tense, bad news came from Jiu Shan State.</p><p></p><p>Due to the sudden rebellion of the Tianling Sect in Jiu Shan State,</p><p></p><p>colluding with internal and external forces, they actually joined hands with the Five Elders Society and seized control of Jiu Shan State in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>With the fall of Jiu Shan State, the entire Immortal Alliance was shaken.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance announced it was entering a state of emergency war readiness, and in order to prevent the Five Elders Society from expanding their gains, a large number of cultivators were mobilized to rush to the borders to organize and establish a defensive line.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators from various states were also prohibited from moving around at will, and were only allowed to move within the heavenly cities of each state for the vast majority of the time.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance was discussing how to recapture Jiu Shan State.</p><p></p><p>And in a place they couldn't see, the army of the Holy Dynasty of Dawai had already boarded the Samantabhadra True Boat and appeared within the borders of the various states of the Immortal Alliance, following the White Mist Barrier.</p><p></p><p>They were just waiting for the decree of the Holy Emperor, and they would swarm down and launch an all-out attack on the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, when do we make our move? I can barely hold back." </p><p></p><p>In the white mist, Ou Shangtian rubbed his hands, his eyes penetrating the White Mist Barrier, extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a bit more. Wait for the deployment in the four central states to be completed." Sun Erlang said very calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, Senior Qiaogong's move of diverting the calamity and dispersing the attention of the Myriad Immortals Alliance is truly a stroke of genius. A large number of troops from the Immortal Alliance have been transferred to the borders, which is undoubtedly a great thing for us." Wang Xuanba said slowly while fiddling with a white snake-like exotic beast in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be careless. Master once said that the Myriad Immortals Alliance is far from as simple as it looks. Those cultivators... are just a smokescreen to deceive people."</p><p></p><p>"You think our Holy Dynasty has the Heavenly Patrol Arrows and Holy Army Puppets, but the Immortal Alliance doesn't? True victory must be fought for with lives." Sun Erlang actually had a clear understanding of the war situation and reprimanded.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p><p></p><p>[Please take a moment to share our website on Facebook, so that we can continue operating]</p>

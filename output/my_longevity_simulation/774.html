        <h1>Chapter 774</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood silently in the secret room for a long time, pondering countermeasures. Having calmed down, he was not overly flustered. After all, his current situation could not be considered utterly desperate. In the vast realm of immortal cultivation, without transcendence, one only has one chance at life. He had merely returned to the same starting point as all living beings. Moreover, he still possessed the immense advantage of foresight accumulated from his previous cycles of reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>"Everything originated from a casual thought back then."</p><p>"When creating the clone body by infusing my essence, I also blended in a strand of Mr. Bai's spiritual resonance."</p><p>Li Fan swiftly analyzed the source of his abnormalities. </p><p>"Indeed, there is no such thing as a free lunch."</p><p>"By resembling Mr. Bai, I gained an otherworldly gift and comprehended some divine abilities."</p><p>"But the price was his gradual influence and contamination of the clone, and even my true self."</p><p>"Although I became wary once I noticed something amiss and intended to transcend immediately if my true self was affected."</p><p>"What I did not anticipate was that by the time my true self realized it, it was already too late."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mind flashed with that shocking, perfect visage once more.</p><p>"Mr. Bai..."</p><p>"Interesting."</p><p>"You want to use me for rebirth? Very well, I shall grant your wish!"</p><p>A glint of light flickered in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p>The immense Tao-refining stone in his consciousness erupted with azure radiance.</p><p>Countless scenes flashed by as he deduced all possible futures.</p><p>"You wish to obstruct my path..."</p><p>"It won't be that easy!"</p><p>Suddenly, the Tao-refining stone's light extinguished.</p><p>But Li Fan had already devised a strategy.</p><p>A cold smile crept across his lips as he calmly resumed deciphering the data of the Supreme Void Spirit Technique.</p><p></p><p>The scene shifted back to Xu Bai.</p><p>Xu Bai pointed at the red cord before him: "Go!"</p><p>The cord seemed to come alive, shooting straight towards the divine embryo.</p><p>At the same time, Xu Bai took out a pile of top-grade spirit stones from his storage ring and crushed them with a palm strike.</p><p>The divine blood embryo method creates offspring or clones without any cultivation base.</p><p>But to the divine embryo Xu Bai, this was no issue at all.</p><p>His talent matched Xu Bai's, reaching an unimaginable level.</p><p>Not to mention he also possessed Li Fan's accumulated cultivation experience from countless reincarnation cycles.</p><p>"Absorb the spiritual essence of heaven and earth to command its energy!"</p><p>The divine embryo Xu Bai murmured softly.</p><p>An invisible whirlwind seemed to stir within the secret room.</p><p>The dense spiritual energy, as tangible as a physical force, howled as it converged on the divine embryo Xu Bai.</p><p>In just a few breaths, he broke through the boundary between mortals and cultivators, successfully entering the Qi Refining stage.</p><p>The speed of absorbing spiritual energy only accelerated without slowing.</p><p>The clone Xu Bai emotionlessly repeated the process of taking out top-grade spirit stones, crushing them, and taking out more.</p><p>An ordinary cultivator absorbing so much spiritual energy in a short time would likely have their body burst apart.</p><p>But the divine embryo Xu Bai was like a bottomless abyss, unfazed as he greedily devoured all the spiritual energy.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the field.</p><p>His realm was also rising at a visible speed.</p><p>Mid-stage Qi Refinement, late-stage Qi Refinement.</p><p>Qi Refinement Perfection!</p><p>The clone Xu Bai also witnessed it for the first time - a truly top-tier new Dao cultivator, without any bottleneck troubles.</p><p>That terrifying cultivation speed!</p><p>"Using the wonders of heaven and earth to build the Dao foundation!" Saintly Embryo Xu Bai murmured again.</p><p>In the dantian, the red thread of Mr. Xu emanated a faint glow.</p><p>Without the slightest obstruction, it was a natural progression.</p><p>In just one breath, Saintly Embryo Xu Bai had successfully established the foundation.</p><p>The faint red thread dissolved into the dantian, becoming his Dao foundation.</p><p>Therefore, he also knew its true name.</p><p>[Heavenly Will Sword].</p><p>"If there is a heavenly will, let it be with me."</p><p>"Wonderful."</p><p>Saintly Embryo Xu Bai and the clone Xu Bai spoke in unison.</p><p>Having entered the Foundation Establishment stage, Saintly Embryo Xu Bai did not stop his cultivation.</p><p>He continued to absorb the dense and pure spiritual qi in the secret chamber without interruption.</p><p>His cultivation realm also rose rapidly and steadily.</p><p>In the Foundation Establishment stage, there was still not the slightest bottleneck or difficulty.</p><p>Early Foundation Establishment, late Foundation Establishment, Foundation Establishment Perfection...</p><p>"Observing the laws of heaven and earth to refine the Elixir of Gold."</p><p>Saintly Embryo Xu Bai stood with his hands behind his back.</p><p>Murmuring to himself.</p><p>He took a deep breath, and the dense spiritual qi in the secret chamber that was about to condense into a liquid instantly vanished.</p><p>He simply took the storage ring filled with spirit stones handed over by the clone Xu Bai.</p><p>Holding it in his hand.</p><p>In the dantian, the red light gradually solidified.</p><p>Saintly Embryo Xu Bai naturally and slowly spoke.</p><p>As if a earth-shattering explosion had occurred.</p><p>The red light permeated throughout the dantian.</p><p>Then it suddenly contracted to the extreme.</p><p>After a moment, a red dot appeared in Saintly Embryo Xu Bai's dantian.</p><p>Saintly Embryo Xu Bai, entered the Golden Core realm!</p><p>In such a short time, he accomplished what ordinary cultivators would take decades or even centuries to achieve.</p><p>He still did not stop his cultivation.</p><p>With the continuous supply of spiritual qi, Saintly Embryo Xu Bai advanced towards the perfection of the Golden Core.</p><p>As expected, there was still no "Heavenly Tribulation" to be seen.</p><p>The double standard of the Mysterious Yellow Realm's Heavenly Dao was evident.</p><p>And when Saintly Embryo Xu Bai finally succeeded in reaching the Perfected Golden Core realm, it had been less than half a day since he was officially created.</p><p>"This is the cultivation speed of Mr. Xu."</p><p>"No, the Mr. Xu back then was even faster. Mortal to Immortal in an instant."</p><p>In the secret chamber, Saintly Embryo Xu Bai and the clone Xu Bai exchanged questions and answers.</p><p>After a long silence, the clone Xu Bai still shook his head slightly.</p><p>"In the current Mysterious Yellow Realm, reaching the Golden Core in half a day is already the limit."</p><p>Saintly Embryo Xu Bai nodded in agreement: "Seizing the essence of heaven and earth to form the Nascent Soul."</p><p>"Without prior preparation, even with the highest talent, it is impossible to advance further."</p><p>"As the saying goes..."</p><p>Saintly Embryo Xu Bai cupped his hands towards the clone Xu Bai and stepped away elegantly.</p><p>"The immortal path ahead is blocked, the Celestial Venerable who transmits the Dao is above!"</p><p>His figure had already disappeared.</p><p>But his voice lingered in the secret chamber, echoing for a long time.</p><p>The clone Xu Bai knew that Saintly Embryo Xu Bai had gone out to seek the opportunity to form the Nascent Soul.</p><p>Perhaps for other cultivators, the process would be extremely arduous.</p><p>But for Saintly Embryo Xu Bai, it was just a trivial matter.</p><p>He didn't even need to worry about Saintly Embryo Xu Bai's safety.</p><p>Although he had just reached the Perfected Golden Core realm,</p><p>Even Transcendental cultivators might not be his match.</p><p>Because...</p>

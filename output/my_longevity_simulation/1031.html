            <p>Chapter 1029 Distorting the Way of Heaven</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not directly express these thoughts in his heart to Qiao Gong Jushi.</p><p></p><p>He just took out another Jie body and followed by his side.</p><p></p><p>Letting him use it when refining Tian Yang's new puppet body.</p><p></p><p>After removing these two, there was only one Jie body left inside Li Fan that was half loaded.</p><p></p><p>The layout of the Compassionate Immortal of the Red Dust in this world has been laid out for such a long time, but only harvested this little.</p><p></p><p>This shows how rare the essence of the original force is.</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong Jushi was about to happily take the golden Jie body back.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Li Fan asked about the specific time required to create a immortal puppet.</p><p></p><p>The answer made Li Fan's expression on his face stunned.</p><p></p><p>"I estimate that ten years should be the minimum." Qiao Gong Jushi said with some uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe it will take even longer. After all, it's also my first time having the opportunity to refine an immortal puppet, so I don't have a clue in my heart."</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong Jushi's gaze drifted, avoiding eye contact with Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Ten years..."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if there will be a chance to see the immortal puppet come into the world in this life."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly and sent Qiao Gong Jushi away.</p><p></p><p>It seems that when it comes to the level of "immortal", the time required increases by thousands of times.</p><p></p><p>It's the same with the deduction of the Doomsday Separation Disk and breaking the prohibition left by Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it doesn't mean that Dharma Transmission is already at the immortal realm, but Li Fan clearly saw the same operation ideas and traces as the immortal-level great formation in these prohibitions.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that he, Dharma Transmission, also has the inheritance from the immortal realm. But due to the lack of immortal spiritual energy, he took a different path."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>But come to think of it, the Mysterious Heaven Mirror is an immortal realm artifact. How could the prohibition that can restrict immortal tools be mundane means?</p><p></p><p>Currently, among those Li Fan knows who have mastered the orthodox inheritance of the immortal realm, Xuan Tian Wang is one, and the Great Dharma Master of Tian Du is another.</p><p></p><p>Previously, it was only a guess about Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate, but now it can be almost confirmed through the prohibition sealing the Mysterious Heaven Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the ages in the Xuan Huang Realm, there may only be these three people who have true immortal inheritance.</p><p></p><p>This is still because an unknown catastrophe occurred in the immortal realm and the immortal path collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Tian Wang and the Great Dharma Master of Tian Du took advantage of the loopholes.</p><p></p><p>Imagine if the catastrophe did not happen. Then there might not be any true immortal orthodox in the mortal world at all.</p><p></p><p>If it is a normal immortal cultivation world with a path of ascension existing.</p><p></p><p>If the immortal realm and the mortal realm can communicate normally, it can be almost certain that this situation will not happen.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes were gloomy.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The difference between immortals and mortals is like the difference between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>In the expectation, after the Separation Disk and the Hua Dao Stone both complete their metamorphosis, breaking Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate's prohibition would just be in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>But when actually operating, it gave Li Fan a feeling of running a horse to death while looking at the mountain.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be close at hand to completely break it, but after the Doomsday Separation Disk ran for a long time, the progress didn't change at all.</p><p></p><p>"This is the immortal means specially used for sealing."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Myriad Spirits Return to Numbers and Emptiness Gives Birth to Flowers are immortal-level formations, there is no place for me to learn from in this regard."</p><p></p><p>"Can only rely on the Separation Disk to forcibly solve it."</p><p></p><p>A sense of helplessness also surged in Li Fan's heart. He monitored the operation of the Separation Disk and temporarily shifted his attention.</p><p></p><p>In his spare time, Li Fan began to ponder how to quickly extract the essence of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>It can be foreseen that when the yin</p><p></p><p>The collision between the faceless true immortal and the immortals of the Immortal Ruins, creating conditions for his own true return, would certainly not give Li Fan much time.</p><p></p><p>It might be just a moment.</p><p></p><p>According to the previous plan, if he wanted to maximize the benefits, he had to simultaneously extract the "Xuanhuang Will Be Born Change" and accumulate for his own advancement to the Hua Shen realm.</p><p></p><p>Possessing the essence of the Tianxuan Mirror, Li Fan was able to read through many sealed records of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Among them were many cultivators' experiences of advancing to the Hua Shen realm.</p><p></p><p>Extracting the changes that heaven and earth will undergo is a long process that requires careful attention.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had also personally witnessed Zhang Zhiliang absorbing the changes of the Congyun Sea and advancing to the Hua Shen realm.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, this was not something that could be accomplished in one go.</p><p></p><p>If one change that is about to occur is like this, what about hundreds or thousands of them?</p><p></p><p>The only thing Li Fan could draw from might be when Mr. Bai gathered many essences of heaven and earth into his body in an instant.</p><p></p><p>That ability called "Ezhan".</p><p></p><p>The reason why ordinary cultivators have to be careful when advancing to the Hua Shen realm is that extracting the essence of heaven and earth will inevitably face the backlash of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Ezhan, seeing it is like seeing me..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly remembered the ability of Jiang, the Dharma transmitter.</p><p></p><p>A flash of inspiration appeared in his mind. He seized this rare opportunity and swallowed a Wudao Dan.</p><p></p><p>Scenes of comprehending the Dao of Heaven in the past cultivation process appeared one by one in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The Dao of Heaven, Mr. Bai's incarnation using his own holy fetus, the holy fetus, and the subtle changes that happened to him...</p><p></p><p>All the details completely reappeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Hua Dao Stone had just completed its transformation. Otherwise, with its original medium-grade quality, it would not have been able to withstand such consumption.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, it was because of a moment of carelessness that I gave the Dao of Heaven Bai an opportunity to borrow my body to be reborn."</p><p></p><p>"But conversely, the body of the Dao of Heaven Bai is still my holy fetus. In other words, another me."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that it was occupied by him."</p><p></p><p>"The incarnation of the Dao of Heaven is me..."</p><p></p><p>"I am the incarnation of the Dao of Heaven..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes became brighter and brighter, and his thoughts kept surging.</p><p></p><p>As if possessed, he kept repeating these two sentences.</p><p></p><p>If there were outsiders here at this moment and saw this scene, they would probably think that Li Fan had gone into a demonic state.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, Li Fan's mind was clearer than ever at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Just like when I used the Canghai Pearl to observe the evolution of the killing intent of heaven and earth, and realized the divine ability 'Formless Killing Intent'."</p><p></p><p>"The Dao of Heaven Bai was born by borrowing my holy fetus, and I was also fortunate to share the same body with the Dao of Heaven."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes seemed to penetrate the sky of the Lingmu Realm and reach the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The hundreds of aspects of living beings seen in the Tianxuan Mirror, the changes of the Xuanhuang Realm seen in multiple reincarnations...</p><p></p><p>Various insights lingered in his mind.</p><p></p><p>A strange aura began to surge in Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>Like a stone statue, Li Fan comprehended the Dao and froze on the spot.</p><p></p><p>I don't know how long had passed.</p><p></p><p>At the last moment when he was about to succeed in comprehending the Dao, Li Fan suddenly woke up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"No, I don't really want to become the incarnation of the Dao of Heaven."</p><p></p><p>"I just want to borrow the authority of the Dao of Heaven..."</p><p></p><p>"That was close..."</p><p></p><p>Even with Li Fan's current state of mind, he couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>Because if the connection between him and the Dao of Heaven of Xuanhuang was really established, and this kind of change happened to him, and he actively did it himself.</p><p></p><p>It probably wouldn't be something that could be restored by returning to reality.</p><p></p><p>After all, returning to reality only changes the world, but Li Fan himself has not changed.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I reacted in time."</p>

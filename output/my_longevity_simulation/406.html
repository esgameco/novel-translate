            <p>"The Supreme One-hearted, is this her name? Or does it represent her defiance against the laws of heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>"How could she appear in person?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, several thoughts flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was filled with uncertainty and astonishment, the voice of the Supreme One-hearted rang out again.</p><p></p><p>"At the beginning of the agreement, it was set with the Law Transmission."</p><p></p><p>"Now that I am here, where is the Law Transmission?"</p><p></p><p>The voice was clear and resounded throughout heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators in Tianlingzhou looked at each other in confusion.</p><p></p><p>Most of the members of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance knew that the Law Transmission Supreme One had long transcended worldly matters and did not care about them.</p><p></p><p>But everyone just thought that the Law Transmission Supreme One was carefree and indifferent to worldly affairs, hence had not appeared for many years.</p><p></p><p>And he, without a doubt, still existed in the world.</p><p></p><p>But today, what did the words of the Supreme One-hearted mean?</p><p></p><p>Where is the Law Transmission?</p><p></p><p>An ominous thought involuntarily emerged in the minds of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"No, no."</p><p></p><p>Fear was evident in everyone's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Law Transmission?" the Supreme One-hearted asked again.</p><p></p><p>The voice was like thunder, echoing throughout Tianlingzhou.</p><p></p><p>And there was a trend of wanting to spread beyond the white mist barrier to the surrounding territories.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, strands of green light appeared like a giant web.</p><p></p><p>Intercepting the voice.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the voice of the Supreme One-hearted faded.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme One-hearted, please leave." said Ji Hongdao again.</p><p></p><p>His face was icy, showing no expression.</p><p></p><p>"If I don't leave, how will you handle it?" Sister Zhao's voice sounded interesting.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of Five Elders Association cultivators below all stepped forward together.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao took a deep breath. "After the Supreme has ascended, he should not be involved in worldly disputes."</p><p></p><p>"This was the agreement between the Law Transmission Supreme and the former Supreme Elders of the Five Elders' Association."</p><p></p><p>"Are you really going to violate it now?"</p><p></p><p>"Boom!" The thousands of Five Elders Association cultivators in formation stepped forward again.</p><p></p><p>Showing the determination of the Supreme One-hearted.</p><p></p><p>"Fine."</p><p></p><p>"In that case..."</p><p></p><p>A trace of hesitation flashed in Ji Hongdao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>But it was quickly suppressed.</p><p></p><p>His eyes showed extreme coldness and determination.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao raised his head and looked at the sky, bowed, and saluted.</p><p></p><p>Above the sky, one after another green lines appeared.</p><p></p><p>Spreading rapidly from the center to the surrounding areas, forming a huge web that enveloped the entire Tianlingzhou.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao straightened up and bowed again.</p><p></p><p>The green light became brighter and brighter.</p><p></p><p>Turning the whole sky into an eerie green.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao then bowed three times.</p><p></p><p>After a while...</p><p></p><p>Countless green threads descended from the huge web.</p><p></p><p>Swiftly racing towards the targets on the ground.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the entire Tianlingzhou seemed to be trapped in a terrifying green spider's web.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators on the Dust-transcending Boat finally saw the power of the Heaven Locking Spirit Array burst forth.</p><p></p><p>But not a single one revealed the excitement they should have had.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they became extremely terrified.</p><p></p><p>Even more than when they just heard that the Supreme One-hearted had personally gone to the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Because the target of the Heaven Locking Spirit Array's attack was not the Longevity Supreme blocking the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, not even the thousands of Five Elders Association cultivators invading.</p><p></p><p>Instead...</p><p></p><p>Every living cultivator in Tianlingzhou.</p><p></p><p>Each green thread that fell indicated the fall of a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>In the high sky, distorted images formed a chaotic and colorful abstract painting.</p><p></p><p>Endlessly...</p><p></p><p>Voices intertwined and overlapped, unable to discern their meanings.</p><p></p><p>Just a cacophony of strange sounds echoing continuously, creating a grand, chaotic, twisted celebratory movement.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the young array masters on the Dust-transcending Boat or Li Fan outside the several territories.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they were all in a state of bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Because what was happening had surpassed their understanding.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven Locking Spirit Array that should have been used to deter the Five Elders Association was now launching a massacre on all the cultivators in the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the densely existing green lines between heaven and earth in Tianlingzhou.</p><p></p><p>"Why?"</p><p></p><p>A sense of endless incomprehension surged in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, in order to ensure the secrecy of the Heaven Locking Spirit Array, would suppress the array masters who built it.</p><p></p><p>However, he never expected that the target of the Spirit Locking Array would be all the cultivators in Tianlingzhou.</p><p></p><p>"This makes no sense at all."</p><p></p><p>"Is the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance mad?"</p><p></p><p>Analyzing one possibility after another in his mind, Li Fan could not find the motive behind the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance's actions.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was pondering, suddenly the sky and earth trembled.</p><p></p><p>Tianlingzhou.</p><p></p><p>And the Tianpanzhou where he was currently located.</p><p></p><p>Both were shaking.</p><p></p><p>His heart raced as if facing a deadly threat.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan got up abruptly, his face solemn as he looked at the sky.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening..."</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, there came an indistinct rumbling from the sky.</p><p></p><p>The whole world trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, all the creatures in the Xuanhuang Realm subconsciously raised their heads and looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>A great fear arose from within them.</p><p></p><p>The feeling of doomsday descending, with no escape, emerged within them.</p><p></p><p>The trembling lasted for a while before finally coming to a halt.</p><p></p><p>The creatures all showed expressions of relief after the catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>But they were still puzzled about what had happened.</p><p></p><p>Before the remaining people could recover, Ji Hongdao spoke again, "Supreme One-hearted, please leave."</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha..."</p><p></p><p>"Haha..."</p><p></p><p>"This is interesting, whose idea is this?"</p><p></p><p>"Staying in the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance seems like a waste of talent. Why not join me!"</p><p></p><p>Sister Zhao chuckled lightly, revealing her figure, and asked with interest.</p><p></p><p>She and Li Fan once saw an image identical to what was circulating in the world.</p><p></p><p>Clad in white, with a charming figure.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao closed his eyes, not daring to look directly.</p><p></p><p>"Please leave, Supreme One!"</p><p></p><p>Cold sweat dripped from his forehead, but he remained resolute.</p><p></p><p>Sister Zhao stared at him for a moment, then looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>"You have guts."</p><p></p><p>Before the words fell, she had already disappeared from sight.</p><p></p><p>In the instant she vanished, the thousands of golden lights that had been suspended in the air fell down.</p><p></p><p>Killing all the attackers from the Five Elders Association.</p><p></p><p>Strangely, in the face of death, these cultivators showed no fear on their faces.</p><p></p><p>And in the high sky, there was no sign of any fallen cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme One-hearted..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao watched the direction where Sister Zhao had left, murmuring for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then he turned around and looked expressionlessly at the array masters on the Dust-transcending Boat.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 510</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Brother Qin's cultivation is truly extraordinary, with a unique yellowish-brown divine aura that can be used for both offense and defense.</p><p></p><p>At the middle stage of Yuan Ying, he could still hold his own against a seasoned cultivator at the great consummation stage of Yuan Ying in battle.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual energy was long-lasting, as he continuously battled without changing his expression for several hours.</p><p></p><p>Under the guidance of Master Zhang, many disciples were defeated by him, with no one able to overcome him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Qin Shou also gave enough face to Master Zhang, either ending in a draw or a difficult victory after prolonged battles.</p><p></p><p>Even though Brother Zhao's disciples were defeated by him, they did not hold any grudge against Qin Shou. Instead, they greatly admired his conduct and character.</p><p></p><p>Even Sister Zhao, after witnessing Brother Qin's demeanor, couldn't help but have admiration in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Observing this, Li Fanyuan couldn't help but curse inwardly, "Luckily, I came out in time, or the walls would have been torn down."</p><p></p><p>He calmly approached Sister Zhang and gently held her delicate hand.</p><p></p><p>Sister Zhang was slightly startled but did not resist when Li Fanyuan suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Is this Qin Shuixiong from the Lianshan lineage? Truly remarkable! I wonder when I can be like him," Li Fanyuan said with a hint of envy.</p><p></p><p>Sister Zhao was originally worried that Li Fanyuan might feel jealous after hearing rumors, but it seemed like she worried unnecessarily.</p><p></p><p>However, amidst her relief, there was a tinge of disappointment in her heart, but she didn't show it. She smiled and comforted Li Fanyuan, "Your diligent cultivation is also rare. It's not difficult to catch up with Brother Qin."</p><p></p><p>Li Fanyuan did not respond, just shook his head slightly and sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Sister Zhao was surprised and quickly asked, "What's wrong? Did you encounter any problems during this closed-door cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fanyuan then said slowly, "During this closed-door cultivation, I had intended to break through and achieve the Golden Dan. However, every time the thought came to mind, my spiritual awareness would warn me frantically, as if there would be a great disaster if I proceeded."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Sister Zhao furrowed her brows. After a moment of contemplation, she relaxed and comforted him again, "Forcing the formation of Dan should not be rushed. Your premonition is likely correct, indicating that the time is not yet right."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, I also believe that," Li Fanyuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he changed the topic, "Since I joined the sect, I haven't left the mountain for several years. The world of cultivating immortals is vast, but I have been staying within the sect, almost like tunnel vision. Now that my cultivation has stagnated, I plan to go down the mountain to seek breakthrough opportunities."</p><p></p><p>"Sister, you..." Sister Zhao, upon hearing this, looked surprised. Despite her initial reluctance, she couldn't help but advise, "The mountains are not as peaceful as the sect. Besides various monsters, even the wandering cultivators aren't easy to deal with. For spirit stones and techniques, they are capable of anything."</p><p></p><p>"Even disciples of our Lian Shan lineage have examples of going missing when they venture down the mountain..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fanyuan interrupted her and said decisively, "My mind is made up, Sister, there's no need to persuade me anymore. The path of immortality is long and arduous. If I lack even this much courage, how can I accompany you on the journey ahead?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Li Fanyuan's candid words, Sister Zhao's face blushed slightly, and she held his hand tighter.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, on the martial arts stage, Qin Shou, who once again gained absolute advantage and was on the verge of another victory, turned to see Sister Zhao looking affectionately at Li Fanyuan, causing a momentary lapse in his concentration. His breath fluctuated, his focus scattered, and he was almost defeated due to the opening being seized by his opponent.</p><p></p><p>With a hint of gloom in his eyes, Qin Shou refocused on the battle on the stage.</p><p></p><p>When he finally managed to turn the tide and secure victory, Sister Zhao and Li Fanyuan had already left, heading somewhere unknown.</p><p></p><p>Though Qin Shou had a smile on his face, the flames of jealousy were already burning within him.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later, Li Fanyuan left the Lian Shan lineage to seek the opportunity to form the Golden Dan.</p><p></p><p>Concerned about his safety, not long after Li Fanyuan's departure, Sister Zhao, citing the search for a breakthrough opportunity, also went down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>The intention was obvious to anyone, but for some reason, her mentor, Master Zhang, did not intervene. Instead, she bestowed upon Sister Zhao a "Tianji Charm," which could guide her towards opportunities at critical moments.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the sect, Sister Zhao quickly found Li Fanyuan based on the prearranged contact method.</p><p></p><p>Using the Tianji Charm, the two headed together towards the southwest, crossing numerous mountains to reach the ruins hidden deep in the thick jungle.</p><p></p><p>After taking a rest and deciding to explore further the next day, that night...</p><p></p><p>"Sister, have you noticed anything strange? It seems like someone has been following us all the way," Li Fanyuan pretended to be asleep but communicated covertly.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Sister Zhao replied, "Could you be too suspicious? I did not notice anyone following us."</p><p></p><p>Li Fanyuan was certain, "My premonitions are often accurate. Sister, do you remember when we were in Daqing Mountain, and the bandits attacked the village? It was because I suddenly felt restless, that you accompanied me to play and relax. That's how we managed to evade a disaster."</p><p></p><p>"The feeling this time is exactly like back then."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Sister Zhao was slightly convinced.</p><p></p><p>"What are you going to do then?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fanyuan snorted, "Lure the snake out of its hole."</p><p></p><p>The next day, just as the two were about to set off, they had a dispute over a trivial matter.</p><p></p><p>The argument was intense, and Sister Zhao even uttered hurtful words, saying, "You owe everything today to me. How dare you lose your temper with me?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fanyuan's face darkened, and he left angrily, walking into the ruins alone.</p><p></p><p>Sister Zhao, still angry, did not immediately pursue him.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, an inconspicuous flying insect followed Li Fanyuan into the ruins.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fanyuan was in battle with the beasts in the ruins, a sword light slashed out in secret, intending to kill him on the spot.</p><p></p><p>In a critical moment, a cold moonlight emanated from Li Fanyuan.</p><p></p><p>In the blurry light, Sister Zhao's graceful figure could be faintly seen.</p><p></p><p>However, at that moment, the beautiful face of Sister Zhao was filled with a murderous aura.</p><p></p><p>With a loud explosion, Qin Shou was forced to reveal his identity.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qin, it's you?!" Sister Zhao, along with her true self and the shadowy figure, surrounded Qin Shou, showing an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Disciples fighting each other is a great taboo! Why did you do this, Brother?" Quranshou gave up the pretense upon the situation being revealed.</p><p></p><p>Spewing foul language, he stared at Sister Zhao with unrestrained lasciviousness.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

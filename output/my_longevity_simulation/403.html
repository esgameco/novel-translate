            <p>Xiao Heng suddenly reacted as well.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Linghu, you clearly said that the Medicine King Cauldron only spent a short time outside the boundary before returning. How is it possible that in such a short time, thousands of years have passed here?" Zhang Haobo furrowed his brow deeply.</p><p></p><p>"The flow of time is different by over a thousand times? Is that really possible?"</p><p></p><p>No one present could answer this question, and they all fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, there is a way to find out what really happened back then." After a moment, Linghu Chang seemed to recall something and suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"When Medicine King Cauldron fell into the Xuanhuang Boundary, it exhausted all its energy and eventually fell into silence."</p><p></p><p>"But you just said that it was through the sensing ability of the small Medicine King Cauldron that we were able to enter here."</p><p></p><p>He looked at Xiao Heng. "Usually, the sensing between Medicine King Cauldrons is one-way. That is, only the holder of the true Medicine King Cauldron can sense the positions of the other smaller Medicine King Cauldrons."</p><p></p><p>"Holding the small Medicine King Cauldron, yet able to sense the position of the true Cauldron. This usually only happens when the sect leader gathers nearby sect cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"This means that either the sect leader has awakened, or after so many years, the Medicine King Cauldron has regained energy and started executing commands on its own, seeking help from the outside world."</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, we must go inside the 'Gate of Life and Death' to check on the sect leader's condition."</p><p></p><p>Linghu Chang said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Gate of Life and Death? Is it that gray stone door at the end of the corridor? We've tried it, and it simply won't open." Su Xiaomei responded.</p><p></p><p>"Of course. When the Gate of Life and Death falls, it separates life and death. Even a Dao Fusion cultivator cannot make the slightest impact. If you were able to destroy it, that would be a big problem." Linghu Chang commented dismissively.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have a way?" Su Xiaomei asked a bit challengingly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." Linghu Chang snorted and remained silent.</p><p></p><p>He flew towards the depths of the passage.</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei and the other two glanced at each other and followed closely.</p><p></p><p>Before long, they arrived at the gray stone door.</p><p></p><p>Linghu Chang had already sat cross-legged, the small Medicine King Cauldron appearing above his head again, emitting a protective barrier.</p><p></p><p>The ground around him was also sparkling with golden light and inscribed with many symbols.</p><p></p><p>He took out a piece of talisman paper and pasted it on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Twenty-four golden needles encircled him on both sides.</p><p></p><p>Four jade plaques were placed in front and back.</p><p></p><p>After completing the defensive measures, Linghu Chang politely said to Xiao Heng and the others, "Please protect me."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what he's showing off for." Su Xiaomei mumbled.</p><p></p><p>Linghu Chang didn't mind and closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Then, a baby image that was eight points similar to Linghu Chang suddenly emerged from his body.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, fellow cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>The baby greeted Xiao Heng and the others in a wrinkled manner, looking very cute.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"The Nascent Infant?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng and the others were shocked.</p><p></p><p>Today's cultivators had long abandoned the cultivation method of 'forming a Nascent Infant from shattered elixirs.'</p><p></p><p>Instead, they directly plundered various paradises to form a domain of paradises as a replacement for the Nascent Infant.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, seeing such a legendary existence, they were surprised and curious.</p><p></p><p>After Linghu Chang's Nascent Infant emerged, he did not fly out of the protective barrier he had laid down.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he took out a set of exquisite green wood armor and put it on himself.</p><p></p><p>After swallowing several pills, he turned into a stream of light and flew towards the gray stone door.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to collide with the Gate of Life and Death, a green light suddenly emanated from his Nascent Infant's body.</p><p></p><p>The stone door was illuminated by this light, as if it had been infected, and it began to show signs of life.</p><p></p><p>Linghu Chang took the opportunity to plunge into the green area of the stone gate.</p><p></p><p>After he disappeared, the stone door returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>"It's miraculous how the Nascent Infant emerges." Su Xiaomei patted the stone gate, making a banging sound.</p><p></p><p>Still unable to enter, she felt a bit regretful.</p><p></p><p>She then looked at Linghu Chang's physical body, which was guarded by many magical treasures.</p><p></p><p>With a turn of her eyes, she said, "This person really has quite a few magical treasures on him."</p><p></p><p>"Do you think he carries so many treasures with him alone?"</p><p></p><p>"In this Medicine King Cauldron, with so many dormant cultivators. How rich could the hidden treasures be?"</p><p></p><p>Su Xiaomei communicated through voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Zhang is right, it's truly a great opportunity." Zhang Haobo echoed.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, our strength is not enough, or else..."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng remained silent.</p><p></p><p>He stared at the gray Gate of Life and Death, lost in his own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Time passed slowly while they waited.</p><p></p><p>One day, two days...</p><p></p><p>Linghu Chang, who had entered the gate, seemed to have disappeared completely, with no news at all.</p><p></p><p>"Could something unexpected have happened?" Xiao Heng and the others couldn't help but worry.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until five days later that the Gate of Life and Death suddenly opened.</p><p></p><p>The Nascent Infant returned.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Linghu Chang's body swayed a bit as he slowly stood up, his face showing a hint of sadness.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Linghu, what happened?" Zhang Haobo asked.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me." Linghu Chang retracted his defenses and entered the stone gate.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, the three of them raised their guard and followed inside.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, it seemed like they were in an endless void, with countless stars shining in the distant background.</p><p></p><p>"A thousand years ago, the sect leader, in order to protect us, had already ascended to immortality," came Linghu Chang's voice filled with a hint of sorrow.</p><p></p><p>"This is a scene recorded by the Medicine King Cauldron at that time."</p><p></p><p>The surroundings of Xiao Heng and the others suddenly started moving rapidly from stillness.</p><p></p><p>Countless streams of light were elongated to form strange curves.</p><p></p><p>And below, a huge light cluster that was vague and incomprehensible was moving away from them.</p><p></p><p>A sigh was heard.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Boundary..."</p><p></p><p>Another hoary voice appeared, "Leader, don't be concerned. With a great catastrophe looming, we escape for survival, which is not wrong."</p><p></p><p>"Although that may be the case, the Xuanhuang Boundary is still our homeland..."</p><p></p><p>"The greater the ability, the greater the responsibility. We, the Medicine King Sect, are just a small sect, too preoccupied with our own affairs, how can we take care of many others? Faced with disasters and the need to save the Xuanhuang Boundary, it is best to leave it to the Ten Immortal Dao Sects." In the hoary voice, there was evident discontent towards the Ten Immortal Dao Sects.</p><p></p><p>"Huang Lao... Forget it, let's not dwell on this." Liu Ruchen paused and brought up something else.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, the attitude of the Ten Immortal Dao Sects this time is quite strange. According to their usual style, when they hear that we are going to raise the sect and escape, they would definitely come out to reprimand us. But for some reason, this time they show no intention of stopping us."</p><p></p><p>"Huang Lao doesn't seem to care: 'When a great disaster is imminent, everyone will flee on their own. Talking about escape, it's not just our Medicine King Sect. Maybe there are too many, and they can't handle it all.'"</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruchen remained silent.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Huang Lao spoke with some excitement, "However, outsiders would never have thought that in our Medicine King Sect, there is a 'Dao Marker' from another cultivation world."</p>

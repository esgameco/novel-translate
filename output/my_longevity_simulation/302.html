        <h1>Chapter 302</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Ji Hongdao's tone was very serious.</p><p></p><p>All the students understood that such an opportunity might only come once in a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>No matter how good their mentality was, they couldn't help but become nervous and expectant.</p><p></p><p>In front of everyone, Ji Hongdao took out a communication talisman, seeming to be contacting someone.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he nodded and ended the communication.</p><p></p><p>He took out a Tianxuan Mirror from his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Tossing it up, it hovered high above everyone's heads.</p><p></p><p>He then took out a silver jade slip and gently crushed it.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless chaotic symbols surged out from the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao made a hand seal, and those symbols flew towards the Tianxuan Mirror in the sky according to a specific order.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted his eyes and saw that on the surface of the Tianxuan Mirror, lines of text flashed in succession.</p><p></p><p>The symbols kept changing, and after absorbing the text from this jade slip, the originally somewhat ordinary Tianxuan Mirror underwent a strange transformation.</p><p></p><p>The outline of the mirror emitted a faint glow and began to dissolve and disappear.</p><p></p><p>Without the constraint of the mirror's edge, the mirror's surface began to expand rapidly in all directions.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, a palm-sized mirror turned into a huge door, a hundred zhang high and thirty zhang wide.</p><p></p><p>On the towering and wide mirror surface, the surrounding scenery was not reflected, only streams of silver light flowing.</p><p></p><p>As everyone was marveling at this scene of change before their eyes, Ji Hongdao flew to the front of the mirror surface and made a hand seal.</p><p></p><p>A beam of silver light shot out from the mirror surface, enveloping Ji Hongdao.</p><p></p><p>A line of symbols on the mirror surface appeared and disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have confirmed Ji Hongdao's identity. The light beam dimmed, and then a touch of black appeared from the center of the mirror surface.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, it expanded to the entire mirror surface.</p><p></p><p>A rectangular spatial passage appeared before everyone.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"Using the mirror image of any Tianxuan Mirror as a node, spatial transmission can be opened?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that it also requires dual verification of password and personnel." Li Fan silently guessed based on the previous signs.</p><p></p><p>"Follow behind me. Only after passing the identity verification of the Tianxuan Mirror can you enter the passage."</p><p></p><p>With that said, Ji Hongdao took the lead and flew in.</p><p></p><p>With excited hearts, the students couldn't wait to fly over as well.</p><p></p><p>Whenever someone was about to approach the passage, a silver light beam would fall from above and lock onto them.</p><p></p><p>If no abnormality appeared and the light beam suddenly disappeared again, it meant the verification was passed.</p><p></p><p>"This seems to have a similar ingenuity to the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation." Thinking this, Li Fan also followed the crowd and squeezed into the spatial passage.</p><p></p><p>A feeling of dizziness hit him fiercely.</p><p></p><p>A sensation extremely similar to long-distance transmission, as if even space-time was stretched and perception was distorted.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, it was like tearing out of a thin membrane that wrapped around the entire body.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan fell into a strange space.</p><p></p><p>All colors instantly faded away, and everything in sight was gray and white.</p><p></p><p>Black lines whistled from the distant other side, brushing past everyone's bodies, some even passing through, and rushing towards the endless distance.</p><p></p><p>White lines also shot out from the abyss above or below, heading in the opposite direction.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, black and white lines collided, the two colors constantly entangled with each other, eventually forming a void point.</p><p></p><p>The duration of the void points varied.</p><p></p><p>Some lasted for a moment, some persisted for a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, they would all completely vanish.</p><p></p><p>Just as everyone was stunned looking at this somewhat surreal and fantastic scene before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's heads suddenly swam, and their perspective abruptly rose to an infinite height.</p><p></p><p>They saw that in this vast world that seemed to have no boundaries.</p><p></p><p>Black and white lines seemed to be moving rapidly without any pattern, yet also seemed to follow certain rules.</p><p></p><p>Colliding, blending with each other.</p><p></p><p>Void points were born and perished in constant flashes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"It's said that all the secrets of the world are hidden in this black and white. Unfortunately, I am of mediocre aptitude and unable to comprehend it." Ji Hongdao's voice of regretful sigh rang in everyone's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, the newborn mirror surface is just ahead."</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao casually grabbed a passing black line, and in an instant, his figure disappeared from everyone's sight along with the black line.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the students also imitated it, grabbing the passing black lines beside them.</p><p></p><p>As if fusing with the black line, the originally high-speed moving gray world also became extremely slow in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Constantly moving towards the distant target, when encountering white lines moving up and down along the way.</p><p></p><p>These white lines seemed to have self-awareness, and would actively avoid them.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, riding the "express delivery", marveled at the sights along the way.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, they arrived at the edge of this gray and white world.</p><p></p><p>The black line faded and disappeared, and everyone recovered their original appearance one after another.</p><p></p><p>Ahead was a colorful halo that clashed with the gray and white world.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because they had stayed here for a long time and hadn't seen colors for a while.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan saw that churning, distorted mass of colors not far away, he inexplicably felt a sense of nausea and disgust in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Gray and white collided and rubbed against the colors.</p><p></p><p>Although it didn't make any sound, Li Fan could feel two powerful forces competing and shaking the space against each other.</p><p></p><p>In the confrontation, a part of the colorful mass seemed to be cut off by the gray.</p><p></p><p>Losing its original colors, it became dull and lifeless, quietly floating at the edge of the space.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, a faint glimmer seemed to light up on them at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Originally gray and white, they slowly started to become a bit crystal-clear and translucent.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao didn't speak, but the students already understood that what was before their eyes was the birth process of the newborn mirror surfaces of Tianxuan Mirrors.</p><p></p><p>They all quieted their hearts and minds to carefully comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan was slightly stunned for a moment, first looking around, then sensing his own body.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but fall into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Time seemed to have accelerated.</p><p></p><p>One after another, newborn mirror surfaces were born.</p><p></p><p>Some stayed in place after birth, while some suddenly disappeared to unknown destinations.</p><p></p><p>But overall, the vast majority floated at the edge of the gray world.</p><p></p><p>The number of mirror surfaces accumulated more and more.</p><p></p><p>Finally, at a certain moment.</p><p></p><p>Endless black and white fine lines surged from the gray world towards the newborn mirror surfaces.</p><p></p><p>Black and white intertwined, like the most exquisite loom, quickly weaving clothes for these newborns.</p><p></p><p>When the mirror surfaces were completely shrouded by the woven fabric of black and white lines.</p><p></p><p>Black and white instantly fused into one.</p><p></p><p>A sphere with an extremely smooth surface and black and white colors flowing in a chaotic manner suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"This is the pivot of the [Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation]." Ji Hongdao's voice rang out just at the right moment.</p><p></p><p>"Did you all see it clearly?"</p><p></p><p>The voice instantly faded away.</p><p></p><p>All the surrounding scenes fell into stillness.</p><p></p><p>And shattered completely.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Tian Lingzhou, when Ji Hongdao drove the huge Dust Ferryboat through the void and left, Li Fan lost the sense of the boundless killing intent.</p><p></p><p>It didn't matter. After all, he had already achieved his initial goal and successfully learned everything that happened in Tian Lingzhou.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he recalled the scene he had just witnessed, but there were many things that puzzled him.</p><p></p><p>If the disappearance of the Supreme Law Transmitting Lord and the probing done by the One Mind Supreme Lord still made sense logically.</p><p></p><p>Then what happened next was a bit puzzling.</p><p></p><p>"Ji Hongdao launched the Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation, instantly killing all the cultivators in a state."</p><p></p><p>"This is a statement. It shows that under the coverage of the Soul-Locking Formation, the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance has the ability to kill the vast majority of cultivators in the world in an instant."</p><p></p><p>"As a threat, demanding Sister Zhao to retreat."</p><p></p><p>"And as the Longevity Supreme Lord, she actually just left like that."</p><p></p><p>"The existence of the Longevity Realm cares so much about the life and death of ants? After transcending, shouldn't it be, 'What does your life or death have to do with me'?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Fan remembered his realization from many years ago.</p><p></p><p>"The number of cultivators should not be too few…"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that ensuring the existence of a certain number of cultivators is even more important to the Longevity Supreme Lord than I imagined."</p><p></p><p>"Why is that?"</p><p></p><p>What made him even more curious was the anomaly that occurred in the Xuanhuang World after the death of all cultivators in Tian Lingzhou.</p><p></p><p>It was like a sign that the end of the world was approaching, and the whole world was trembling.</p><p></p><p>All living beings in the world felt inexplicable fear.66shuxiushuba.com</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan, who possessed the ability to come back at any time with the Still True technique, felt the same.</p><p></p><p>The contradiction between the Xuanhuang World and the cultivators was so sharp that it was almost irreconcilable.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, the more cultivators died, the better it should be for the world.</p><p></p><p>But now, it was absolutely not the case.</p><p></p><p>What could be the reason for this?</p><p></p><p>Repeatedly pondering, but due to the lack of clues, Li Fan currently could not find a reasonable answer.</p><p></p><p>He also remembered seeing the One Mind Supreme Lord.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had seen the presence of a powerful being in the Longevity Realm.</p><p></p><p>Casually blocking the attack of the Heavenly Profound Soul-Locking Formation.</p><p></p><p>Even the powerful Merge Dao practitioner, Ji Hongdao, didn't dare to look directly at her.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, her strength was unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>"One Mind should be similar to Transmitting Law, representing Sister Zhao's defiance of heavenly principles."</p><p></p><p>"What does One Mind mean?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>"One Mind signifies focus and unity."</p><p></p><p>Focus was obviously not right, unity..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze slightly hardened.</p><p></p><p>He also remembered some strange words uttered by Sister Zhao.</p><p></p><p>"Staying in the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance is a waste of talent. Why not join me!"</p><p></p><p>Join...</p><p></p><p>"Me?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan seemed to understand something.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the thousands of Wulao Club cultivators who came to attack. 69shuba com新</p><p></p><p>They all maintained the same expression from start to finish.</p><p></p><p>Without any command, their words and actions were surprisingly consistent.</p><p></p><p>Even in the face of death, there was no trace of fear.</p><p></p><p>After all of them fell, there were no corresponding anomalies in the sky.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The crowd... is united?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan seemed to have a realization.</p><p></p><p>"All living beings are born different. In the world, they are all individual entities."</p><p></p><p>"If this principle is reversed..."</p><p></p><p>"You in me, me in you. In reality, we are one."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly remembered hearing about the existence of things like the Consciousness Aggregation Body and the Unity Body before crossing over.</p><p></p><p>A huge group seemingly composed of many individual life forms.</p><p></p><p>But in essence, they were a collective sharing all perceptions.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Sister Zhao's cultivation path is likely this?"</p><p></p><p>"Assimilating all living beings in the world?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately felt something was not right.</p><p></p><p>Sister Zhao had already achieved the Longevity Supreme Lord, which meant she had successfully reversed the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>But obviously, the vast majority of the cultivators in the Xuanhuang World had not been assimilated by her.</p><p></p><p>"Does this mean that the principles reversed by the One Mind Supreme Lord only apply to specific areas?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan speculated faintly.</p><p></p><p>"When Ji Hongdao mentioned completing the 'Theorem,' was it referring to the necessary step to achieve the Longevity Supreme Lord?"</p><p></p><p>A glimpse of Tian Lingzhou allowed Li Fan to once again glimpse the highest secret of this world.</p><p></p><p>But to truly understand the meaning behind it, more information was needed.</p><p></p><p>For now, Li Fan put it aside and returned to Tianpanzhou's Xiancheng through the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>He applied to visit the headquarters of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance for free and view the "Museum of Divine Treasures" as one of his current level thirty privileges.</p><p></p><p>Before long, his application was approved, and he could choose his visit time within a year.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chose to visit immediately.</p><p></p><p>After receiving a message that the "Guide" would come to pick him up and asked him to wait patiently in Tianpan City.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He did this not out of leisure. He wanted to find a safe place to take shelter in the final moments of life, with the realization that the remaining array masters who did not arrive due to various reasons would also be cleaned up.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could naturally rely on the Still True technique immediately.</p><p></p><p>But there was still some time needed in this world.</p><p></p><p>At least, he had to wait for Xiao Heng and the others to come out of the Medicine King Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>For Li Fan at this moment, there was no safer place in the world than the headquarters of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, the headquarters had its own defense mechanism, and Ji Hongdao and the others were unlikely to attack directly inside.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, it created a kind of illusion.</p><p></p><p>Since I am already in the headquarters of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance, it was as if I was a turtle in a jar, why fear that I would escape?</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, it could make Ji Hongdao and the others relax their guard, clean up the remaining targets first, and deal with Li Fan later.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was waiting for the "Guide".</p><p></p><p>In the Cangwu Abyss, inside the Medicine King Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng and the others were helping Linghu Chang, opening one sealed room after another, taking out the bodies and burying them.</p><p></p><p>Back then, in order to prevent the Medicine King Cauldron from falling into the fate of the "Immortal Ruins," Liu Ruchén not only sacrificed himself and Elder Huang but also used the lives of hundreds of disciples in a dormant state as fuel, dragging the Medicine King Cauldron out of the abyss.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the withered bodies of his former senior brothers, Linghu Chang's face was full of uncontrollable sadness.</p><p></p><p>He removed all the valuable items from their bodies.</p><p></p><p>After cremating the bodies, Linghu Chang said in a deep voice, "I want to rebuild the Medicine King Sect."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng and the others looked at each other and couldn't help but say, "Friend Linghu, the current situation is different from the past..."</p><p></p><p>Linghu Chang interrupted with a gesture, "I know that now is not the same as before."</p><p></p><p>"So, the senior brothers and elders who are currently in a state of dormancy, practicing the same technique as me, I will not wake them up for now."</p>

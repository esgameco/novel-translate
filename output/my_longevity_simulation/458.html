        <h1>Chapter 458</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan smiled mysteriously and whispered softly for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan's eyes lit up upon hearing this and he nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, within the guarded city of the Wanxian Alliance, various remnants of sects in the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Numerous faces with the same expression began telling stories to those around them.</p><p></p><p>The protagonist of the story was an ancient repairer from the Celestial Mechanism Sect who had just awakened after sleeping for a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>This person possessed the secret techniques of the Celestial Mechanism Sect, wielding the precious item "Heavenly Dice of the Universe," capable of harmonizing yin and yang, understanding creation, and even foreseeing the future.</p><p></p><p>If one could receive his guidance, various opportunities would be easily within reach, leading to immense wealth and even changing fate.</p><p></p><p>He Menghao from the Congyun Sea was a living example of this.</p><p></p><p>If one didn't believe it, they could investigate to find out!</p><p></p><p>In any case, from Jiao Xiuyuan's descriptions, Li Fan was praised as being extremely powerful, comparable to ancient diviners.</p><p></p><p>However, most repairers did not believe such exaggerated claims, dismissing it as antics to boost one's reputation.</p><p></p><p>But there was still a very small group of repairers who became interested in Li Fan and inquired more details from Jiao Xiuyuan.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Jiao Xiuyuan remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Once curiosity was piqued, it was not easily extinguished. Many repairers couldn't help but ask their friends in the Congyun Sea for more information.</p><p></p><p>They were shocked to discover that perhaps this was not just false talk.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, within the Congyun Sea, there were repairers who, through Li Fan's guidance, had gained great profits.</p><p></p><p>Unable to contact Li Fan directly, they turned to He Zhenghao and the repairers who had participated in Li Fan's initial recruitment.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao at this time was a bit confused, bombarded with numerous inquiries that left him unsure.</p><p></p><p>He had no choice but to instinctively respond.</p><p></p><p>The other recruited repairers were in a similar situation.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the information was confirmed.</p><p></p><p>Some were disappointed as the first recruitment phase only required a mere contribution of two hundred thousand points.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like a typical scam, and they believed they could easily do it themselves.</p><p></p><p>However, after researching the list of recruited repairers, some were secretly delighted, believing they had found a rare opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Because they discovered a repairer named Zhou Peng in the list.</p><p></p><p>Although Zhou Peng's cultivation was not high, he had a deep relationship with Elder Gongsun of the Celestial Mechanism Hall in the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>The name of Gongsun Qixuan was well-known even among repairers outside the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>If Li Fan was truly a fraud, would Zhou Peng be fooled?</p><p></p><p>Each time Zhou Peng participated in the recruitment, he almost bet all his wealth, indicating that this ancient Celestial Mechanism Sect repairer was indeed extraordinary!</p><p></p><p>After another round of screening, the number of repairers seeking Li Fan's contact information decreased. However, their enthusiasm grew.</p><p></p><p>Within the Qianli Hall, Li Fan sat calmly on the fishing platform, showing no sign of concern.</p><p></p><p>Allowing the rumors to ferment for over ten days, when the public's discussion of Li Fan gradually began to decline.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Jiao, it seems we can start the next plan," Li Fan said in a solemn tone.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, let me handle the next step," Jiao Xiuyuan grinned mischievously, and the atmosphere quieted once again.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, all over the Wanxian Alliance, whether it be repairers watching the spectacle or repairers desperately seeking Li Fan's contact information.</p><p></p><p>They all received new information from Jiao Xiuyuan.</p><p></p><p>Recently, too many repairers wanted to approach Li Fan, causing him great annoyance.</p><p></p><p>Facing numerous accusations of being a "fraud," Li Fan decided to prove his strength.</p><p></p><p>Thus, he entrusted Jiao Xiuyuan to disseminate the message.</p><p></p><p>The time was set three days later.</p><p></p><p>This announcement caused a stir.</p><p></p><p>Those who believed in Li Fan were secretly anticipating, while those who considered him a fraud were full of disdain, waiting for Li Fan to be exposed.</p><p></p><p>Believers and non-believers aside, the topic was buzzing.</p><p></p><p>In a short time, the majority of mid-to-low-level repairers in the Wanxian Alliance were looking forward to Li Fan's performance three days later.</p><p></p><p>As for the higher-level existences above the Nascent Divinities, they were not too concerned with such trivial matters.</p><p></p><p>Only a few extremely idle ones cast a glance.</p><p></p><p>As the repairers discussed among themselves, the agreed time finally arrived.</p><p></p><p>Despite the Thousand Miles Hall usually being deserted, at this moment, it was crowded with people.</p><p></p><p>They all eagerly watched Jiao Xiuyuan as they awaited Li Fan's statement.</p><p></p><p>Numerous Jiao Xiuyuan puppets moved uniformly, with identical expressions.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept over everyone, his demeanor solemn.</p><p></p><p>Clearing his throat, Jiao Xiuyuan solemnly said, "Friend Li Fan said, in order to prove that he is not a fraud and to defend the honor of the Celestial Mechanism Sect."</p><p></p><p>"He is willing to sacrifice his life force and activate his secret techniques. In the end, he successfully foresaw the future once again!"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan paused slightly in his words, firmly capturing the attention of everyone present.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he continued loudly, "He saw that, not long after, the price of an item called 'Universal Tranquil Leaf' would skyrocket!"</p><p></p><p>"It even caused a stir throughout the entire Wanxian Alliance!"</p><p></p><p>With that, silence fell around.</p><p></p><p>Before everyone could react, Jiao Xiuyuan quickly flashed back into the Thousand Miles Hall.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a loud bang, the doors closed tightly.</p><p></p><p>No matter how the outside world shouted, there was no response.</p><p></p><p>"Universal Tranquil Leaf? What is that? A sudden price surge? Is it real..." Most of the onlookers were puzzled and skeptical.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, some quick-thinking individuals had already hurried back to the Tianxuan Mirror to check its price.</p><p></p><p>To their amazement, they found that at the moment when Jiao Xiuyuan made the announcement, the price of the Universal Tranquil Leaf had risen from 265 points straight up.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, stay rational! Certainly, it's because too many people bought it in an instant, causing the price to rise."</p><p></p><p>"This fraudster named Li Fan surely hoarded a large quantity early on, waiting for everyone to drive up the price before delivering the goods!"</p><p></p><p>A knowledgeable person analyzed for a while, persuading the repairers around them sensibly.</p><p></p><p>However, the price surge was indeed happening before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>If the price were to fall later, as long as they sold before that happened, they could still make some profit, right?</p><p></p><p>More people watched as the price of the Universal Tranquil Leaf kept rising and eventually couldn't resist, trying to buy some.</p><p></p><p>Although each person's purchase might not be significant, the total number of repairers was quite considerable.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the trend of the Universal Tranquil Leaf price surge accelerated.</p><p></p><p>In a short period, it jumped from 265 points to 300 points.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan and Jiao Xiuyuan were also frantically purchasing, in a courtyard of the Tianchu State.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Dantai! Trouble is brewing! Look at the price of the Universal Tranquil Leaf! It's 310..."</p><p></p><p>"Wait, it's 320 now!"</p><p></p><p>When Dantai Can returned to his senses, the price had already reached 340 points.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no!"</p><p></p><p>"Never mind the price, quickly buy all the Universal Tranquil Leaves available on the market!"</p><p></p><p>He urged in frustration.</p>

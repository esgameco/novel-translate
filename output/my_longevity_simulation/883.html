        <h1>Chapter 883</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The entire small world of the empire trembled under this terrifying might. The ocean below surged with towering waves. The city built upon the body of Chi Jiu also shook incessantly, as if it could fall from the sky at any moment. </p><p></p><p>What shocked Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong even more was that under this oppressive force, let alone the strange beasts commanded by the Imperial Guards, even the two of them were filled with fear in their hearts and couldn't muster any thoughts of resistance!</p><p></p><p>"The gap in strength is too great. I'm afraid even if we release that Fusion Beast, it would be no match for this person!" </p><p></p><p>"If we forcibly resist, the other party could easily destroy the empire in a single thought."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong glanced at each other, their eyes revealing helplessness and unwillingness. </p><p></p><p>"We can only play along for now and think of a plan later."</p><p></p><p>They thought to themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, we are willing to surrender." Xiao Qing lightly bit her silver teeth and said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph. Don't think I don't know what you're thinking." Seeing this, Li Fan retracted the Hollow Sky Phantom. </p><p></p><p>His gaze swept back and forth between Qing and Hong: "You'd better give up on those little schemes of yours. The Myriad Realms United Association has been observing you for a long time."</p><p></p><p>"I know all about those so-called trump cards of yours."</p><p></p><p>"Even if the [Emperor One] himself came, I would not fear him, let alone that crude imitation of his."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's words were wildly arrogant, but falling on the ears of Qing and Hong who didn't know Li Fan's true strength, they were shocked and abruptly raised their heads.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's unfathomably deep gaze made their hearts turn cold.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Phenomena Fusion Beast was an absolute secret of the empire. Only the successive emperors and the two of them knew about this matter.</p><p></p><p>However, this powerful expert from the Myriad Realms United Association that they had never heard of also knew about it?</p><p></p><p>Doesn't that mean they have no secrets in the eyes of the other party?</p><p></p><p>More crucially, they had no idea when the secret was leaked.</p><p></p><p>A sense of dejection and panic surged in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Even long ago, when facing Longevity Realm experts in the Beast Taming Sect, they had never felt so powerless.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, take me to the empire's treasure vault." Seeing that he had intimidated them enough, Li Fan ordered indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The situation had come to this point. Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong no longer had any thoughts of resistance. They could only obey Li Fan's orders.</p><p></p><p>Very quickly, Li Fan once again arrived at the imperial treasure vault containing countless precious treasures and information.</p><p></p><p>It was not much different from what he saw in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>After taking a simple stroll around and checking on the status of the Myriad Phenomena Fusion Beast, Li Fan revealed his true intentions.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan turned around and stared at Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong, saying in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the two birds completely lost their composure.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you exactly?" Xiao Qing's beautiful eyes were filled with shock, her body trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>To know the name of their master Xu Ke, and even be clearly aware of his past research on the Myriad Beasts Reincarnation Wheel...</p><p></p><p>Plus the four words "Myriad Realms United", a possibility couldn't help but surface in Xiao Qing's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Beast Taming Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing their utterly shocked expressions, Li Fan revealed a sinister smile.</p><p></p><p>"What, don't tell me you want to resist?"</p><p></p><p>"So be it, I'll grant your wish."</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk tsk, if that kid Xu Ke knew that you..."</p><p></p><p>"It must be very painful to hear the news of Xu Ke's death, right?" Li Fan said with a strange laugh.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong hurriedly said, "Senior, you misunderstood..."</p><p></p><p>"Wait, senior, what do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>They stared at Li Fan blankly.</p><p></p><p>"You guessed it right, that kid Xu Ke is still alive." Li Fan snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>This news was too shocking, Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong almost couldn't control themselves and nearly fell down.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, don't dawdle. Death..."</p><p></p><p>"Or submission!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's somewhat impatient expression, Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong's hearts tightened.</p><p></p><p>"We..."</p><p></p><p>"Are willing to submit." Xiao Qing bowed her head.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of hesitation, she still handed over a jade pendant engraved with a green phoenix.</p><p></p><p>This jade pendant originally belonged to Xu Ke, and she had been carrying it with her all these years.</p><p></p><p>Handing it over at this moment, her eyes were full of reluctance.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Xu Ke's image vaguely appeared in front of her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Beast Control Wheel..."</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed worthy of being the supreme treasure of the Beast Control Sect, so mysterious."</p><p></p><p>After the Beast Control Sect migrated to the small world to take refuge, they dispatched elite disciples to study the Beast Control Wheel.</p><p></p><p>They tried to find a way to control beasts without cultivating the true secret of beast control.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't know if they finally succeeded.</p><p></p><p>But later, Xu Ke, who escaped, researched and created the "Heart Connection Art" to manipulate the exotic beasts in the small world of the empire.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had long known about the Heart Connection Art.</p><p></p><p>What he was really interested in was the mystery of the Beast Control Wheel.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke was indeed a natural talent who was favored by Mr. Bai and founded the imperial lineage.</p><p></p><p>The level of detail about the Beast Control Wheel recorded in this jade pendant was beyond Li Fan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>"With such detailed information, when the Medicine King's True Cauldron returns, Fang Zai might be able to forge a weakened version of the Beast Control Wheel."</p><p></p><p>Although there was still some time before the Medicine King Sect returned, Li Fan had already arranged work tasks for them in advance.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xiao Qing's dejected appearance, Li Fan smiled and threw the jade pendant back to her.</p><p></p><p>"I know you have some plan to escape the Xuanhuang Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"But I can tell you very clearly that it's a path to self-destruction."</p><p></p><p>"Outside the endless void, there are dangers everywhere. It's much more dangerous than the Xuanhuang Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed slightly, and then his expression turned solemn: "Following our Myriad Worlds Alliance to counterattack the Cultivation Realm and reoccupy the Xuanhuang Realm is the only way to survive!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Li Fan's words, Xiao Qing became more certain of her judgment.</p><p></p><p>This so-called Myriad Worlds Alliance was indeed formed by the sects that escaped to various small worlds in ancient times.</p><p></p><p>"This place of yours is a bit weak, but it also has some unique aspects."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan commented a few words, and then assigned tasks to them: "For example, the spiritual energy synthesis technology is very useful for many small worlds without spiritual energy."</p><p></p><p>"However, the current efficiency is still too low."</p><p></p><p>"Even if you use all the power in the realm to cultivate exotic beasts and slaughter them all, it can't meet the needs of many small worlds."</p><p></p><p>"So..."</p><p></p><p>Feeling Li Fan's gaze, Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong's hearts trembled.</p><p></p><p>"Upgrade the spiritual energy synthesis technology at all costs."</p><p></p><p>"I'll give you three years. After three years, I will come to check."</p><p></p><p>"If the results satisfy me, there will be rewards."</p><p></p><p>"If not..."</p><p></p><p>"Waste is a waste of resources, it's better to die early."</p>

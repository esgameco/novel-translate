            <p>Chapter 1068: Reincarnation Determines the Dangerous Situation</p><p></p><p>At first, the Myriad Immortal Alliance had some restraining effect on these cultivators who were gradually losing their sanity, and the immortal cities in each state were relatively safer. </p><p></p><p>But as both sides later became frenzied with killing, the prohibitions of the Immortal Alliance became less effective.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators would engage in life-and-death battles in the city at the slightest disagreement.</p><p></p><p>Initially, the city's disciplinary formation was still effective. The towering dharma stone statues descended with white light, annihilating the cultivators who violated the laws.</p><p></p><p>However, later on, more and more cultivators were fighting to the death, and even the Myriad Immortal Alliance inevitably developed great misgivings.</p><p></p><p>They only selectively activated the city's grand formation.</p><p></p><p>This selective law enforcement undoubtedly encouraged the cultivators' frenzied fighting behavior.</p><p></p><p>In the fanatical atmosphere, the few remaining cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm who had a more peaceful state of mind also slowly changed. They began to participate in the mutual slaughter.</p><p></p><p>The mutual slaughter between cultivators was not only reflected in their present life.</p><p></p><p>Even hostility in the Tianxuan Mirror could lead to bloodshed.</p><p></p><p>A mysterious person named [Heavenly God's Eye] gradually became famous among the cultivator community, though no one knew when it started.</p><p></p><p>This person's background was unknown, but his divine powers were vast. As long as you told him a secret about yourself, he could provide you with the true identity of the cultivator behind the Tianxuan Mirror account you wanted to track!</p><p></p><p>At first, the cultivators were a bit skeptical.</p><p></p><p>But practice reveals the truth.</p><p></p><p>More than a hundred cultivators who were suddenly found by their enemies and died miserably were the best proof of [Heavenly God's Eye]'s power!</p><p></p><p>You should know that in the past, it was common to have disagreements over trivial matters in the Tianxuan Mirror and subsequently develop grudges.</p><p></p><p>But because all information in the Tianxuan Mirror was strictly confidential, there was no way to understand the grievances even if you wanted to. You could only vent verbally across the void.</p><p></p><p>Now, the emergence of Heavenly God's Eye has changed everything!</p><p></p><p>Have you ever offended someone in the past due to a moment of loose lips? Don't want to be suddenly killed by enemies without any preparation?</p><p></p><p>Then why not strike first?!</p><p></p><p>Under the secret instigation of Heavenly God's Eye, the frequency of revenge killings in the Myriad Immortal Alliance rose again.</p><p></p><p>The sight of cultivators falling from the sky had already become the norm.</p><p></p><p>The doomsday plan was progressing quite smoothly, but Li Fan's mood was not so good.</p><p></p><p>In the Hundred Stones Grotto-Heaven of Shilin State.</p><p></p><p>Two figures that looked extremely similar were standing in front of a Tianxuan small mirror.</p><p></p><p>One of them was Li Fan's true body.</p><p></p><p>And the other was a false immortal puppet body that Li Fan had ordered the Ingenious Artisan to forge for him during this period.</p><p></p><p>Without using the essence of source power, the strength of the puppet body could not reach the level of Tianyang, comparable to the Longevity Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan did not care about the actual combat power of the puppet, but valued its ability to perfectly blend in with the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Incidentally, in order to deal with the upcoming Dharma Preacher Jiang, the consciousness implanted in the immortal puppet was also modified.</p><p></p><p>In his perception, he was truly a member of the vast Myriad Realms United Association, responsible for hunting down the remnants of the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>As for the secrets of [Huan Zhen] and other secrets of Li Fan's true body, they were all absent from his memory.</p><p></p><p>The immortal puppet Li Fan was naturally the [Heavenly God's Eye] who had risen to prominence.</p><p></p><p>He used the authority of the mirror's origin to greatly promote the process of mutual slaughter among cultivators, while also obtaining a lot of secret information from the cultivators' hearts.</p><p></p><p>Although some of it seemed completely worthless, as long as it was collected...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>This knowledge might come in handy in some future reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the immortal puppet Li Fan was diligently playing the role of the Heavenly God's Eye.</p><p></p><p>The real Li Fan was beside him, frowning slightly.</p><p></p><p>"At this point, why haven't Mo Rubin and Tian Xuanjing made a move?"</p><p></p><p>"Only the holder of the Mirror's Origin can read the encrypted messages of Tian Xuanjing. Mo Rubin should have long realized that I was behind the recent series of world-ending events."</p><p></p><p>"But I never sensed anyone investigating along this line..."</p><p></p><p>"It's the same with Mo Rubin, Tian Xuanjing, and even the Myriad Immortals Alliance. Mo Rubin didn't share information with the Myriad Immortals Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"They directly ignored me?"</p><p></p><p>"Or are they busy with more pressing matters?"</p><p></p><p>Even though he had run through countless possible scenarios in his mind, at this point, there were too many factors involved from various parties.</p><p></p><p>It was unrealistic for everything to go smoothly according to plan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could only deal with things as they came.</p><p></p><p>But what he didn't expect was that before the third step of the plan could begin, another inexplicable change caught him off guard.</p><p></p><p>On this day, after the battle between hundreds of cultivators ended.</p><p></p><p>A mysterious blood-colored vortex appeared and devoured all the impending cultivator death phenomena!</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored vortex appeared in every place in the Xuanhuang Realm where cultivators had fallen.</p><p></p><p>People discussed the origin of this vortex.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't affect the increasingly strong killing intent in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The slaughter continued.</p><p></p><p>"Reversing life and death?"</p><p></p><p>"At this critical moment, is the Rebirth Venerable about to successfully prove his Dao?"</p><p></p><p>As if to confirm Li Fan's guess.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, endless crimson light erupted from the hole in the sky.</p><p></p><p>In addition to illuminating the world in a bloody hue, the sky also revealed the illusory images of continuous, majestic palaces.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators on the ground couldn't see the details of the palaces, only the central [Rebirth Mansion] fell into the eyes of all cultivators!</p><p></p><p>As the three characters [Rebirth Mansion] appeared in their minds, information about it naturally emerged.</p><p></p><p>Death is not true death, but reincarnation and rebirth?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the cultivators unanimously stopped fighting.</p><p></p><p>Deeply shocked by this earth-shattering change.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the Rebirth Mansion Li Fan had experienced before.</p><p></p><p>In this life, the Myriad Immortals Alliance could not manipulate the operation of the Rebirth Mansion. It had become a law of heaven and earth in the Xuanhuang Realm, like [Dao cannot be cultivated together]. Except for going against the principle again, there was no other way to influence it.</p><p></p><p>Correspondingly, at this moment, no cultivator could know the specific details about reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>They only knew that from now on, there was a [Rebirth Mansion] in the world, which would thoroughly change the future pattern of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>How to reincarnate, whether memories and cultivation would remain after reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>These answers would only be revealed after a cultivator experienced a complete reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>However, the fact that death was not death, but reincarnation, directly influenced the cultivators' decisions.</p><p></p><p>The psychological burden of taking lethal action was further reduced.</p><p></p><p>Every cultivator in the Xuanhuang Realm turned into a ruthless villain. If anything was slightly unsatisfactory, they would fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>However, for Li Fan, the death of cultivators could no longer harm the Xuanhuang Realm, so it lost its meaning.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on with this Rebirth Mansion?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took the lead and questioned Preceptor Zhou and the others.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 940</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, the spy organization of the Five Elders Conference also seemed to have been significantly affected. No one had come to receive them.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing had no choice but to continue deeper until she reached a place called Fan Qingzhou, where she finally received a response.</p><p></p><p>However, after connecting to the communication, the other party did not speak.</p><p></p><p>They were just waiting for Li Qing to speak first.</p><p></p><p>"I am a member of the Multiverse Alliance and have an urgent matter that requires me to contact your superior," Li Qing transmitted her message.</p><p></p><p>"Multiverse Alliance? What is that?" The voice from the other side sounded as if they had just woken up from a dream.</p><p></p><p>The voice sounded very young.</p><p></p><p>After a brief chaotic noise, the contact person quickly changed to a calm middle-aged cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Please forgive me, fellow Daoist. Every place is in chaos now. Many key figures in the organization have disappeared during the great battle, and their life or death is unknown. So we cannot confirm your identity at the moment..."</p><p></p><p>He directly rejected Li Qing's request for a meeting.</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, Li Qing spoke, "It is at times like this that critical intelligence is needed the most. The information I have is enough to turn the tables on the crisis faced by your Five Elders Conference..."</p><p></p><p>"Such a great merit, are you willing to miss it for nothing? With positions vacant now, if you can distinguish yourself..."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Myriad Immortals Alliance has already gained an absolute advantage. You're not still worried that I'm a spy sent from their side, are you?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's tone was full of sarcasm, and with just a few short sentences, she directly broke through the other party's psychological defenses.</p><p></p><p>The breathing on the other side instantly became rapid.</p><p></p><p>However, the communication was temporarily interrupted.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing was not anxious but waited patiently with confidence.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, after half a day, the middle-aged cultivator took the initiative to contact her.</p><p></p><p>"Where shall we meet?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's make it clear first, I'm coming on my own. If the intelligence you provide is not reliable, I'll just pretend I never met you."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing smiled slightly and told the other party her location.</p><p></p><p>Before long, a black flowing light could be seen flying from the horizon.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator whose entire body was wrapped in metal armor, with his appearance indiscernible, quietly appeared in front of Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>"That outfit is not bad," Li Qing commented.</p><p></p><p>The armor worn by the middle-aged cultivator was exactly the same as the equipment of the cultivators who flew out of the floating city in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"It's only at times like this that Shangri-La is willing to bring out these good things."</p><p></p><p>"If they hadn't been hiding and hoarding, we wouldn't have been defeated so miserably," the middle-aged cultivator replied briefly, his tone full of complaints.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, a transparent ripple surged out from his battle armor.</p><p></p><p>Isolating the inside from the outside, the scene outside the barrier instantly became blurred.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, it's safe here. What is the important intelligence you mentioned that can turn the tide of the war?" The middle-aged man stared at Li Qing and asked nervously.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing smiled disdainfully, "As I said, it's heavyweight intelligence that can reverse the situation. How could I tell you so easily?"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged cultivator became a little anxious, "Then what do you want?"</p><p></p><p>"At the very least, I will only speak to someone who can make decisions," Li Qing said firmly.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't speak, how do I know if you're lying or not? At this sensitive moment, I bring a person of unknown identity to meet those above? Do you think I'm tired of living?" The middle-aged cultivator was obviously not in charge of intelligence and spy work before.</p><p></p><p>He had basically no</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"What?" The middle-aged cultivator was stunned at first, and then directly exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>"Is this true?" His voice trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I'll be waiting right here for someone who can speak on the matter," Li Qing said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged cultivator lowered his head and pondered for a moment, but eventually gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>Without any fluctuations in his spiritual consciousness, he completed the notification.</p><p></p><p>Faced with this heavyweight information, the Five Elders Council finally showed a hint of the efficiency they should have had.</p><p></p><p>In the time it takes to drink half a cup of tea, hundreds of black streams of light flew over to this place.</p><p></p><p>They were all wearing metal battle armor, surrounding Li Qing in a circle.</p><p></p><p>The leader was actually a female cultivator. She walked straight up to Li Qing: "Fellow Daoist from the Myriad Realms Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing nodded, confirming her identity.</p><p></p><p>"My name is Qing Yang, and I'm responsible for rebuilding the post-war intelligence system. Come with me."</p><p></p><p>Escorted by hundreds of cultivators, Li Qing arrived at an underground fortress.</p><p></p><p>She remained expressionless throughout the entire process.</p><p></p><p>This made the people of the Five Elders Council quite convinced.</p><p></p><p>This underground fortress was apparently just built to deal with the attack of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the deepest secret room, Qing Yang ordered the others to leave, leaving her alone with Li Qing face to face.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Qing Yang, you don't even dare to show your face, making it hard for me to believe," Li Qing said with a light smile, shaking her head.</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, the black metal battle armor receded, revealing Qing Yang's true appearance.</p><p></p><p>Her appearance was not outstanding, the kind that would be inconspicuous in a sea of people.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Qing keenly noticed that there was an indifference to life in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing carefully observed for a long time before slowly speaking: "Exchange the information of the Immortal Chosen for the information we want."</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Qing Yang nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want?" Qing Yang asked directly.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is the Immortal Alliance treasure that the Myriad Immortals Alliance wants?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Seemingly very surprised by this question, Qing Yang was stunned on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"This... I don't know either. But this matter shouldn't be a secret, I'll ask."</p><p></p><p>The metal light once again concealed Qing Yang's face.</p><p></p><p>When she showed her face again, it was full of doubt and surprise.</p><p></p><p>"The information exceeds my authority..."</p><p></p><p>Now she was a bit unsettled.</p><p></p><p>"Sorry, please wait a moment." Qing Yang hurriedly left the secret room.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, this seemingly excuse of an Immortal Alliance relic actually exists."</p><p></p><p>"Back then, what treasure did the Myriad Immortals Alliance have that they can't forget for thousands of years?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Qing was pondering, Qing Yang quickly returned.</p><p></p><p>The expression on her face was a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>She directly gave the answer: "The so-called Immortal Alliance relic is the remnant souls and bones of the first generation members of the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Back then, when the immortal sects surrounded and suppressed the Myriad Immortals Alliance, in order to make an example out of them, they extracted the souls of those defeated and stubborn transmitters and tortured them day and night."</p><p></p><p>"It was a common practice back then, announced to the world. But now it seems a bit unsightly, so it's kept secret."</p><p></p><p>In the Spirit Wood Realm, Li Fan sensed the answer heard by his clone, and his eyes couldn't help but narrow.</p><p></p><p>He remembered that during the 115th world, the Five Elders Council launched a surprise attack on the Myriad Immortals Island, seemingly also to dig up the remains of the first generation transmitters.</p>

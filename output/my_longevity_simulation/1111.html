        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1109: Failing to Overcome Tribulations in Body and Mind</p><p></p><p>A Golden Core cultivator stumbled and accidentally broke his leg while walking.</p><p></p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator, flying in mid-air, lost control of his spiritual power and fell to his death.</p><p></p><p>A Primordial Spirit cultivator, due to an overly intense battle with someone else, suddenly suffered a heart attack and died...</p><p></p><p>These were the bizarre examples that appeared at that time.</p><p></p><p>Later, this small-scale calamity eventually disappeared without a trace due to the strange energy slowly dissipating around that alien star.</p><p></p><p>In the present era, it has long been forgotten and does not exist in any historical records.</p><p></p><p>Only the Tribulation Transcendence Sect recorded it using a special cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>"A power capable of affecting the entire Xuanhuang cultivation world is undoubtedly at the immortal level. It's a pity that the alien star was just a chance passerby for the Xuanhuang world. It never appeared again since then."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but feel a little regretful.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, thinking about those familiar cultivators having to live like mortals seemed quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>The paper men of the Tribulation Transcendence Sect were not telling Li Fan about these past calamities in the Xuanhuang world out of boredom.</p><p></p><p>They clearly had another purpose.</p><p></p><p>As one cruel scene of tribulation after another appeared in Li Fan's mind, these calamities gradually faded away, and the tortured Xuanhuang world was finally reborn.</p><p></p><p>He also couldn't help but feel a sense of relief at having "survived the disaster."</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but feel a bit more appreciation and cherishment for the current safe and stable state of the Xuanhuang world, which had not come easily.</p><p></p><p>Of course, all these brainwashing effects eventually dissipated quickly as the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra circulated.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan still acted very seriously, with just the right expressions on his face.</p><p></p><p>Finally, seeing their methods take effect, the three paper men honestly returned to the Book of Tribulation Transcendence.</p><p></p><p>"The various tricks of the Tribulation Transcendence Sect are mostly related to toying with people's minds. The viciousness of this sect is evident."</p><p></p><p>"What a pity they encountered me. Humph..."</p><p></p><p>Ever since releasing the Book of Tribulation Transcendence from the seal of the Dharma transmission, they had been subtly relying on Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Lingering like restless ghosts, following him around.</p><p></p><p>Although with Li Fan's current attainments in formations, he could completely use formation techniques to forcibly seal them again.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan did not do so.</p><p></p><p>Because being pestered by these Tribulation Transcendence Sect paper men was not without benefits.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes and gazed into the distance at the Xuanhuang world.</p><p></p><p>He could vaguely see countless paper men scattered all over Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>When he focused his intention on one of them, that paper man also inexplicably opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could also see clearly through the paper man's eyes the scene it was monitoring.</p><p></p><p>After a short while, this connection was forcibly severed.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the authority is still not quite enough." Li Fan sneered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The benefit of accepting the brainwashing of the Tribulation Transcendence Sect paper men was the gradual acquisition of control over the "Eyes that Observe the World."</p><p></p><p>The process of seemingly agreeing with the Tribulation Transcendence Sect's philosophy was also the process of joining and becoming a part of the sect.</p><p></p><p>But obviously, Li Fan was only going to enjoy the benefits and had no intention of joining this Tribulation Transcendence Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Only with sufficient strength can one remain unscathed by any disaster."</p><p></p><p>"Hiding like a turtle is no skill at all."</p><p></p><p>"What's the use of constantly avoiding? When the immortals of the Immortal Ruins previously destroyed the world with a glance, they disappeared without even a struggle."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who already knew how the Tribulation Transcendence Sect behaved when true calamity struck, was very disdainful and scornful of their philosophy.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>With his nose.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't underestimate them either.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he acted very seriously to deceive them.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was dealing with the Crossing Calamity Sect, the great play of the True Immortal's Remnant Body was also about to reach its climax.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Immortals Alliance, which had been tracking the remnant body for a long time, finally figured out the patterns and methods of its appearance.</p><p></p><p>This time, they sent as many as ten Harmonious Dao cultivators to surround and intercept it, determined to capture this so-called True Immortal's remains that had caused such a great commotion.</p><p></p><p>Even three Dharma Transmitters assisted in this operation.</p><p></p><p>Faced with such a huge force besieging it, the black puppet obviously couldn't handle it.</p><p></p><p>In the end, under Li Fan's command, its body dissolved, pouring the last few portions of the stored dark power into the True Immortal's remnant body.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the True Immortal's remnant body, replenished with power, disappeared again under the eyes of everyone and the encirclement of the Myriad Immortals Alliance!</p><p></p><p>However, this time it didn't escape too far.</p><p></p><p>The group of Myriad Immortals Alliance cultivators who were tracking it quickly discovered its whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>Unlike before, when it appeared and disappeared mysteriously, it was now fleeing using the normal flying escape method of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"It seems he's finally had enough of this game of hide-and-seek!" A Harmonious Dao cultivator said, with a hint of anger in his tone.</p><p></p><p>Anyone would inevitably be irritated after being led by the nose by a remnant body for such a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, chase after it! Be careful, don't underestimate it!"</p><p></p><p>"Not good, he's trying to escape into the Devouring Origin White Fog!"</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter, I have the Samantabhadra True Boat with me. Continue the pursuit!" Wei, one of the Dharma Transmitter squad leaders, said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Releasing a flying boat, the Harmonious Dao cultivators entered it and then closely chased after the True Immortal's remnant body.</p><p></p><p>Some of them were obviously not entering the white fog for the first time.</p><p></p><p>There was no fluctuation in their eyes, and they calmly locked onto the position of the True Immortal's remnant body in front of them.</p><p></p><p>"There's something strange. Before, he only acted outside, how come he suddenly led us into the white fog?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be a trick?"</p><p></p><p>They looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>However, with their current combined strength, even if they encountered a Longevity Realm cultivator, they could still retreat safely.</p><p></p><p>So they didn't have too many concerns.</p><p></p><p>Without much hesitation, they quickly reached a consensus and continued to chase, to see what trick this True Immortal's remnant body was playing.</p><p></p><p>In the white fog, time passed without knowing.</p><p></p><p>And the strange smell that the True Immortal's remnant body was emitting was also very obvious, as if it was afraid that the Myriad Immortals Alliance behind would lose it, it would slow down on purpose while flying.</p><p></p><p>Maintaining a fixed distance between the two sides.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the True Immortal's remnant body seemed to be very familiar with this white fog, changing directions from time to time.</p><p></p><p>It clearly had a definite destination.</p><p></p><p>This strange scene made the Myriad Immortals Alliance cultivators inside the Samantabhadra True Boat look grim.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Dharma Transmitter Wei finally decided to still follow behind and get to the bottom of it.</p><p></p><p>After all, as a Dharma Transmitter, he wouldn't perish.</p><p></p><p>And even if this True Immortal's remnant body had some plot, if he could figure it out at the cost of a life, it would still be very worthwhile.</p><p></p><p>As for these Harmonious Dao cultivators beside him...</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Wei was unperturbed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The True Immortal's remnant body and the Samantabhadra flying boat.</p><p></p><p>One in front and one behind, speeding through the white fog.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the scene in front of them suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>When they saw clearly what was ahead, the cultivators on the boat, including the few Dharma Transmitters, all showed shocked expressions, their minds greatly shaken.</p><p></p><p>An endless ocean, with countless corpses floating in it.</p>

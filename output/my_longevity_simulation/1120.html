            <p>Chapter 1118: The Heavenly Venerable's Puppet</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a formation that Li Fan had recently deduced, it was tailor-made for the people of the Lingmu Realm. With the Tianyang Immortal Puppet as the core, relying on its longevity realm's defensive capabilities, it could maximize the combat power of others.</p><p></p><p>This formation also had an effect similar to Soul Burning, which could fully stimulate the potential of the cultivators in the formation in a short period of time. Although it was at the cost of burning their divine souls.</p><p></p><p>Before gathering the formation to retreat, the Holy Fetus Li Fan took one last look at the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The next life will be better."</p><p></p><p>Then, without any lingering attachment, he led the crowd to charge out of the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they thought they would encounter the heavy encirclement of the Wanxian Alliance's forces. However, what Li Fan and the others didn't expect was that outside the void of the Lingmu Realm, it was actually empty!</p><p></p><p>But strangely, the feeling of being watched at all times, which lingered in everyone's minds, still existed!</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!" Baihua Daoist was the first to speak out in warning. Her face was deathly pale, and there was even cold sweat flowing from her forehead. Even when facing Li Fan's coercion before, she had never been so disheveled and lost her composure.</p><p></p><p>Because what she felt from Li Fan before was just pure killing intent. But now...</p><p></p><p>"Pure evil..."</p><p></p><p>People from the Yaowang Sect, such as Liu Ruchen, also acted as if facing a great enemy.</p><p></p><p>Although the front looked empty and no one was guarding it, they all stopped charging forward in unison.</p><p></p><p>Including Li Fan, who was leading.</p><p></p><p>Because instinct told them that as long as they rushed over, they would die.</p><p></p><p>As if being stared at by a natural enemy, everyone's bodies stiffened, not daring to move rashly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Tianyang's voice entered Li Fan's ears.</p><p></p><p>"In front. Longevity realm. Strange."</p><p></p><p>Concise, grave.</p><p></p><p>Falling into the ears of the Holy Fetus Li Fan, it was like a thunderclap.</p><p></p><p>"Longevity realm?"</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma Transmitter has arrived?"</p><p></p><p>His heart seemed to be tightly grasped, and even the breath of Li Fan's true body hidden in the Abyss became disordered.</p><p></p><p>"Yes. The Wanxian Alliance has long known the news that the Multiverse Alliance has a longevity realm existence. After the initial probing, they naturally won't send people to die in vain, but will directly use decisive force to settle it once and for all."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"In order to avenge the few Dharma Transmitters, He would personally take action? Isn't that too beneath His dignity?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was obviously a little caught off guard by the appearance of the Dharma Transmitting Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>But immediately after, all kinds of doubts arose in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Judging from the Dharma Transmitting Heavenly Venerable's previous attitude towards the Dharma Transmitters, it was obvious that He only regarded them as tool people. Perhaps He had some special treatment for Dharma Transmitter Jiang, but in His eyes, the other Dharma Transmitters might not be any different from ordinary cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Would the Dharma Transmitter personally appear to punish for the mere three Dharma Transmitters?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Fan had also felt the Dharma Transmitting Heavenly Venerable's vast and mighty power before. His aura was sacred, vast, and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>It absolutely had nothing to do with the "evil" surrounding them at the moment!</p><p></p><p>"If it's not the Dharma Transmitter, who could it be?"</p><p></p><p>There were only a few longevity heavenly venerables in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Excluding the five heavenly venerables of the Five Elders Council, it was impossible to be Wangsheng who had just attained the Dao.</p><p></p><p>As his thoughts turned rapidly, a name that was suppressed deep in his memory and almost forgotten suddenly appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Pole Heavenly Venerable!</p><p></p><p>Regarding the Eastern Pole Heavenly Venerable, even if one searched through all the classics of the entire Wanxian Alliance, there were only a few sentences about Him.</p><p></p><p>His life seemed to have been deliberately erased by someone, and the only thing that could be known was that the [Purifying Spirit Pool] currently used by the Wanxian Alliance to remove the mortal miasma from mortals' bodies was His</p><p></p><p>The Invention.</p><p></p><p>Apart from this, there is nothing else.</p><p></p><p>A generation's Eternal Venerable, and also the only Venerable in the Myriad Immortals Alliance besides the Dharma Transmitters.</p><p></p><p>To actually receive this treatment is truly bizarre and unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't His own request, then what happened to Him is very thought-provoking.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Eternal Venerables of the Mysterious Yellow Realm are all known for their methods that defy principles.</p><p></p><p>Only this Eastern Extremity seems to be just His name.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In a moment, countless thoughts flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>And the surrounding malicious intentions also launched attacks on the people of the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>The power of a Venerable is truly different from ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Sun Puppet, originally emitting a pure white light, suddenly seemed to be tainted with an ominous aura. The light flickered uncertainly, and Heavenly Sun's expression was solemn, as if struggling against that aura. On the surface of the puppet's body, black spots stained here and there.</p><p></p><p>The attack of the evil aura bypassed the protection of Li Fan's formation and fell upon every person in the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Not everyone has the means to resist an Eternal Venerable.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, they were corrupted.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan also saw the consequences of being completely tainted by the evil aura.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they instantly launched attacks on their companions beside them, clearly having completely lost their own will.</p><p></p><p>Almost in an instant, the Spirit Wood Realm team was already in chaos, showing signs of defeat.</p><p></p><p>Yet the enemies hidden in the darkness still did not show themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the true combat power of an Eternal Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>"Defeat is acceptable. But to not even see His true face..."</p><p></p><p>Amidst the chaos, Li Fan's expression did not fluctuate in the slightest, only looking towards Heavenly Sun.</p><p></p><p>A dazzling crimson suddenly surged from within Heavenly Sun.</p><p></p><p>Like the great sun in the sky, illuminating the surrounding dark space.</p><p></p><p>"In Heavenly Sun's life..."</p><p></p><p>"He is not inferior to anyone!"</p><p></p><p>The body of the Heavenly Sun Puppet instantly expanded by hundreds of thousands of times. Like a colossal man of flames from the beginning of creation, standing in the dark void.</p><p></p><p>Circles of crimson flames erupted from his body, constantly spreading outwards.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to incinerate the entire space.</p><p></p><p>Under the burning of Heavenly Sun's fierce flames, the Spirit Wood Realm allies were unharmed.</p><p></p><p>Those cultivators corrupted by the evil aura, amidst extremely piercing miserable screams, turned into black ashes.</p><p></p><p>And the culprit who had been hiding in the darkness was finally forced to reveal his form!</p><p></p><p>The scene before him made Saint Fetus Li Fan's eyes slightly narrow.</p><p></p><p>A tall, naked man stood in the void.</p><p></p><p>Black hair reaching his ankles, his body covered in black, evil-aura-emitting patterns.</p><p></p><p>And behind the naked man, countless threads could be vaguely seen, appearing from the void and deeply piercing into the man's body.</p><p></p><p>The naked man's eyes were completely black, expressionless. Just like those cultivators who had their minds controlled.</p><p></p><p>"Eternal Venerable, a puppet on strings..."</p><p></p><p>This bizarre scene made the people of Spirit Wood Realm's hearts all rise with an irrepressible chill.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan even sharply inhaled a breath of cold air.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"The inexplicably missing Eastern Extremity Venerable has actually become like this?"</p><p></p><p>"Although not dead, but a fate worse than death..."</p><p></p><p>"Who did it?"</p><p></p><p>"Those Dharma Transmitters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance definitely don't have this ability."</p><p></p><p>"The only possibility is the Dharma Transmission!"</p><p></p><p>In the Underworld, Li Fan's true body subconsciously clenched his fists.</p>

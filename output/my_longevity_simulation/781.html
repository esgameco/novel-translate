        <h1>Chapter 781</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Three days later, the Cong Yun Sea reverted to its appearance when it had just been completely annihilated by Mo's attack - molten lava raging, riddled with holes. </p><p></p><p>The coil in Saint Embryo Xu Bai's hand emitted dazzling white light and disappeared into the Xuanhuang Realm, appearing within his own celestial realm. It transformed into dripping spring rain, falling to the earth.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then saw signs of life emerging in the mountains, lakes, and forests within the celestial realm. Without any prior indication, fish, birds, and beasts suddenly appeared from all around. </p><p></p><p>With the addition of these living beings, true vitality finally manifested within this celestial world. If it were a normal evolution, it would have taken hundreds of millions of years for this to occur.</p><p></p><p>But with the blessing of the World Revival Power, it happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"This skill is truly divine," Li Fan couldn't help but admire.</p><p></p><p>After all, in his previous life, even the well-cultivated Five Elements Celestial Realm was mostly just plants, still far from becoming a true "world."</p><p></p><p>Yet Xu Bai's celestial realm within his saint embryo had achieved this in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Cong Yun Sea, he did not stop harvesting the world's generative power.</p><p></p><p>However, his work afterwards was more akin to making minor repairs. There were no more earth-shattering changes within the celestial realm, only subtle transformations occurring in unnoticed corners.</p><p></p><p>"I can't learn this, I really can't learn it," Li Fan kept recalling Xu Bai's movements in extracting the Revival Power.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had experienced it firsthand, he was still completely clueless about how Xu Bai had accomplished it.</p><p></p><p>It had clearly surpassed the level Li Fan could currently comprehend.</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary Yuan Ying cultivators take the celestial realm as the basis of their cultivation. I've never heard of anyone directly devouring a small world."</p><p></p><p>"I can't imagine how powerful he will become after truly ascending to the Deity Realm."</p><p></p><p>"And what kind of celestial essence will he merge with?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but look forward to it.</p><p></p><p>During Xu Bai's journey through the Xuanhuang Realm, there was one thing that caught Li Fan's attention.</p><p></p><p>Given Xu Bai's appearance and demeanor, he should have drawn the notice of other cultivators wherever he went.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his actions in harvesting the world's generative power should have attracted even more attention.</p><p></p><p>Yet strangely, all the cultivators they encountered completely ignored him.</p><p></p><p>It was like being hidden in plain sight!</p><p></p><p>"Such a divine ability would be perfect for me," Li Fan pondered after a long while. "It seems to involve blending into the myriad things of the heavens and earth..."</p><p></p><p>Saint Embryo Xu Bai was about to ascend to deityhood, while on Li Fan's side, he was also about to refine the "Emperor Beast."</p><p></p><p>All the frozen exotic beasts from the Life-Sealing Treasure Box had been thrown into the mix.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had even added the flesh and blood of the Crimson Nine-Headed Beast and the blood essence of the Roc.</p><p></p><p>"Boom! Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Dazzling radiance burst from the images of all the exotic beasts above the Myriad Phenomena Crucible.</p><p></p><p>The metal crucible shook violently, creaking sounds coming from all sides, as if it could shatter at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Another preparation is complete," Li Fan said, using hand seals to temporarily seal the array around the crucible before storing it in a separate storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then took out some other materials...</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>According to the methods derived from the memories of the Tianyang Record, Li Fan began to refine and create a mechanical puppet.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaos Mantra is the only means by which I can possibly disturb the vision of the Immortal Venerable of Heaven."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, it seems that the Immortal Venerable cultivators in this world are highly attentive to the Chaos Mantra. So, not only will I have to personally unleash it, but it must also erupt simultaneously in different places."</p><p></p><p>"The so-called 'the wind howls, the crane cries, and all things are on alert'!"</p><p></p><p>A glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes, and in just a few days, a somewhat crude-looking black puppet was refined.</p><p></p><p>It was not particularly intelligent, and its functions were quite simple. The only purpose was to execute the predetermined orders without being affected by any external factors, including Li Fan himself.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaos Mantra, even if I were to unleash it myself, would be extremely difficult."</p><p></p><p>"The only way is for me to separate the character '乱' (Chaos) into individual strokes. Then, the puppets will assemble it into the complete mystical technique."</p><p></p><p>"If I were to try to split the full power of the '乱' character, I might not be able to handle it. However, I don't need the full power, just the chaotic aura, so I can give it a try."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mind was divided, as he supervised and recorded the activities of Xing Tai Xu Bai while continuously refining the puppets and contemplating the method of decomposing the Chaos Mantra.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had the secret technique of "Transforming the Dao into One," which, although not chaotic, was still effective.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Immortal Valley, Jiang Yushan unleashed a powerful black killing aura, which fell upon the newly refined Yao Wang True Cauldron, but was easily blocked by the black radiance emanating from it.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan's brow furrowed slightly, while Fang Zaici was quite pleased.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, look at the craftsmanship of my old friend. This new cauldron is incredibly sturdy. I'm afraid even the three of us working together would be unable to cause any damage to it."</p><p></p><p>"And this is just relying on the inherent strength of its materials. If we were to activate its array formations and fully utilize its defensive capabilities, it might even be able to withstand the attacks of the Immortal Venerable of Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>"I must thank the Sect Master for being so generous, providing all kinds of heavenly materials and treasures without sparing any cost. In my life, I've never had such ample resources to refine such powerful artifacts."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai, who was testing the hardness of the Yao Wang True Cauldron, was quite satisfied: "Thank you, Elder Fang."</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that the small world where the Taiyi Sect is located has officially been incorporated into the Myriad Immortal Alliance. To demonstrate its exemplary role, they even allow Immortal Alliance cultivators to visit for free. Since Elder Fang has worked so hard on refining this artifact, why don't you come with me to take a look and see the situation there?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai smiled at Fang Zaici, ignoring the gaze of Liu Sanpie, as he directly stored the now slightly blackened Yao Wang True Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>"The Taiyi Sect, huh..." Fang Zaici hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"They were quite troublesome in the past. I was constantly being hunted down, never having a peaceful day, all because of the Taiyi Sect disciples who tracked down my hiding place."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai chuckled: "That's all in the past now. Since they've joined the Myriad Immortal Alliance, and you have no grievances with them, there's no need to keep pursuing them."</p><p></p><p>After Xu Bai's words, Fang Zaici became somewhat eager: "I've heard that the Taiyi Sect has a treasure called the 'Transforming the Dao Stone Mother.' Its illusions are so vivid that it has even created another true reality. I've long heard of its fame, but have never had the chance to witness it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's eyes gleamed: "Ah, I've heard of that as well. It is the Taiyi Sect's most precious treasure, so it may not be easy to see it."</p><p></p><p>"Whether we can feast our eyes on it this time will depend entirely on fate."</p>

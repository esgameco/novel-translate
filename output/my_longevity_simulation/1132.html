        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1130: Inferior Version of the Heavenly Patrol Arrow</p><p></p><p>The Empire's research results were all backed up here. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan strolled through this vast treasure trove until he reached the end, where the Myriad Beasts Furnace was located, before turning around.</p><p></p><p>He took out an object and showed it to the two.</p><p></p><p>The circular plate, only the size of a palm, inadvertently exuded a pressure that made Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong's bodies tremble, and they couldn't help but feel the urge to kneel down.</p><p></p><p>"Is this...?"</p><p></p><p>They resisted their body's instincts and looked at the circular plate in Li Fan's hand with a look of horror: "The Myriad Beasts Wheel?"</p><p></p><p>The feeling that life and death were at the other's whim instantly reminded them of this legendary treasure of the demon beast race.</p><p></p><p>However, after staring at the circular plate for a long time, they still found that something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>As demon beasts, their bloodline memory contained their ancestors' memories of the Myriad Beasts Wheel.</p><p></p><p>But it was clearly different from what Li Fan was holding.</p><p></p><p>The real Myriad Beasts Wheel had a more ancient and simple aura.</p><p></p><p>And this one in front of them...</p><p></p><p>Indeed had some control over them.</p><p></p><p>But if they resisted with their lives, they might not necessarily be unable to break free. There was still quite a difference from the legends of not having freedom over life and death.</p><p></p><p>"A replica?"</p><p></p><p>Qing and Hong both had this thought at the same time, looking at Li Fan in surprise and doubt.</p><p></p><p>"You guessed right. It is indeed a replica created by the Alliance elders based on the research data of the Myriad Beasts Wheel you provided before."</p><p></p><p>"In addition to being able to restrain the myriad beasts, it also has other functions, which is the main purpose of my coming here this time."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly sighed: "Although the destruction of the Spirit Wood Realm did not result in many casualties, we fled in a hurry and didn't have time to take out many precious materials and research data."</p><p></p><p>"So after much consideration, the elders decided to implement the inter-realm backup plan to make copies and preserve all the valuable things in each small world..."</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan finished speaking, Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong's faces had already changed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to say indifferently: "This is also for your own good. After all, your Empire's self-defense capabilities are really too poor. As long as the Myriad Immortals Alliance casually dispatches one or two Dao-merging cultivators, they can completely destroy you."</p><p></p><p>"Keeping a copy of civilization seeds in the Alliance, even if something unexpected happens, it can be quickly rebuilt."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan fiddled with the circular plate in his hand and looked at the countless frozen exotic beast specimens in the Imperial Treasury: "Your greatest wealth is actually the various exotic beasts you have cultivated over the years. I know you always keep more than one backup, I'm only taking one of them."</p><p></p><p>With that said, without regard for Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong's reactions, a beam of light shot out from the circular plate, sweeping over these frozen exotic beasts.</p><p></p><p>All those that were illuminated instantly disappeared on the spot.</p><p></p><p>And on the circular plate in Li Fan's hand, the phantoms of those exotic beasts seemed to faintly appear.</p><p></p><p>It looked like these frozen exotic beasts were absorbed and preserved in it. In fact, they had already been directly decomposed by the light beam of the circular plate. At the same time, the structure, bloodline, tissues and other information of these exotic beasts were all recorded in the circular plate.</p><p></p><p>"All the demon beasts under heaven originate from [Emperor One]."</p><p></p><p>As the amount of recorded exotic beast information increased, the phantoms on the circular plate also became more and more.</p><p></p><p>Not only did the aura it exuded become more powerful...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The strict and powerful image of the disc itself changed because of it.</p><p></p><p>It became more and more similar to the true Wanshouzhuanlun (Ten Thousand Beasts Disc) in Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong's memories.</p><p></p><p>And in the process of collecting the backups of the exotic beasts, Li Fan couldn't help but sigh at the wonders of creation.</p><p></p><p>Except for some exotic beasts that were directionally and deliberately bred, the birth of the vast majority of exotic beasts in the empire basically originated from various coincidences.</p><p></p><p>Different bloodlines intertwined and mutated, and new species mutated into different subgroups.</p><p></p><p>It seemed endless.</p><p></p><p>"Infinite possibilities." The words that Emperor Yishou said in the Yunxian Illusion suddenly appeared in front of Li Fan's eyes again.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan was about to absorb the information of a frozen exotic beast as usual, he suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Because from this exotic beast, he felt a familiar aura.</p><p></p><p>"Xuntian Arrow..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's movement pause and where his eyes fell, Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>They hurriedly explained: "This exotic beast is the core of the arrow that the envoy instructed us to study before. We named it [Lie Kong]. Back then, in the Beast Taming Sect, we had seen similar demon beasts, but they were far less fierce and fast than the current ones. Moreover, they had a strong sense of self and were difficult to control."</p><p></p><p>"The currently bred offspring still have some gaps compared to the mother that the envoy gave us. So we have not reported it."</p><p></p><p>After a search, Li Fan indeed found a similar group next to the Lie Kong exotic beast.</p><p></p><p>"If the core is insufficient, I can use formations to make up for it. Even if it can't reach the damage power of the real Xuntian Arrow of the Wanxian Alliance, having half of it is still very practical." Thinking this way, Li Fan absorbed the information of these Lie Kong exotic beasts into the disc.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Thoughts returned to the present.</p><p></p><p>The disc that carried the research essence of the empire was naturally the [Wanshou Crystal].</p><p></p><p>With the refining level of the Tianji Realm, plus the detailed information about the Wanshouzhuanlun obtained from Xu Ke, it was not difficult to create an imitation.</p><p></p><p>"Condensing the physical body of an exotic beast from the Wanshou Crystal requires a large amount of spiritual power. My current late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivation cannot support it. But as long as I wait for Sun Erlang to drive the Taiyan Boat and return from the Xuanhuang Realm, it will be fine."</p><p></p><p>"With the Daoyi Insect, plus Lie Kong, Daxuan will have the capital to conquer other small worlds."</p><p></p><p>Going to the Youjie requires the Youzu people to initiate a special ritual.</p><p></p><p>Don't think that Li Fan easily suppressed the Youzu people in the previous life. That was because his body possessed the Five Elements Great Hole Heaven, and his true combat power was still above the ordinary Hedao realm.</p><p></p><p>And in this life, Li Fan, who is already in the True Immortal Net, cannot easily improve his own realm.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the Daxuan Realm alone, the Youzu people are not that easy to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it is also necessary to improve the combat power of the Daxuan military and civilians as much as possible, as well as to improve the level of Li Fan's own [Tiandi Qidian].</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood on the [Shenghuang Seat] and began to think about suitable conquest targets.</p><p></p><p>A month later, Sun Erlang successfully drove the Taiyan Boat back.</p><p></p><p>It also began the first step of Daxuan's ascension to the spiritual power world.</p><p></p><p>With the successful creation of the first Heaven and Earth Smelting Furnace, spiritual energy began to spread within the scope of Xuanjing City.</p><p></p><p>The Daxuan Imperial Guards were the first to feel the existence of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Overnight, the more than a hundred imperial guards who possessed the [Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Chant] successfully drew qi into their bodies and embarked on the path of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>And among them, the best, Sun Erlang, even relied on the power of [Zuoxian Jue] to be promoted to Qi Refining Perfection in one go.</p>

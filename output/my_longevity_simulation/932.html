        <h1>Chapter 932</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The translation of the excerpt is as follows:</p><p></p><p>In the secret chamber of the Lingmu Realm, it took the true body and the clone more than a month to read through the texts just once.</p><p></p><p>Among them, several techniques such as the "Heaven and Earth Confrontation Rhapsody" and the "Eternal Solitary Secret" were almost identical to the knowledge Li Fan had obtained in the illusion realm.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the descriptions in the illusion realm were even more rudimentary.</p><p></p><p>Take the Heaven and Earth Confrontation Rhapsody for example. In the illusion realm, it was simply a dual cultivation technique. When the great tribulation of incompatible techniques arrived, the effect of this technique to rapidly improve cultivation was also negated.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, besides dual cultivation, this technique had another more important and more mysterious use.</p><p></p><p>That was to lock onto a target and forcibly share destiny, cultivation speed, and even personal qualities such as comprehension with the other party.</p><p></p><p>It was called "Heaven and Earth sharing the same lifespan."</p><p></p><p>For true peerless geniuses, this technique was naturally extremely useless. But for someone like Li Fan, it was undoubtedly a profound technique.</p><p></p><p>This was only the divine ability that the initial layer of the "Heaven and Earth Confrontation Rhapsody" could possess.</p><p></p><p>When cultivated to a profound level, just as the name of the technique suggests, the locked target could even extend from people to the heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"With a mortal body, balancing the authority of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed a true inheritance from immortals."</p><p></p><p>The upper limit of the "Heaven and Earth Confrontation Rhapsody" was extremely high, and it was even vaguely mentioned that it could still be used after ascending to the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>The only fatal flaw was...</p><p></p><p>The locked target would sense the cultivator of the technique.</p><p></p><p>This was exactly what "confrontation" meant.</p><p></p><p>Just based on this point alone, the importance of this technique greatly decreased in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>As someone who liked to plan before taking action and scheme in the dark, exposing himself to another person at all times was really not a wise thing to do.</p><p></p><p>The only possible greatest use he could think of now was to capture a peerless genius and keep them in captivity.</p><p></p><p>And then forcibly equalize with them to improve his own comprehension, aptitude, destiny, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan read through the "Heaven and Earth Confrontation Rhapsody" and briefly scanned the "Eternal Solitary Secret".</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister Zhao actually felt at ease handing over this dao-achieving technique to me..."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that among all these techniques, this "Eternal Solitary Secret" was the least valuable.</p><p></p><p>Because the principle of "All Hearts as One" had already been occupied by Zhao Ruoxi.</p><p></p><p>There was no way forward, and there was even a possibility of Senior Sister Zhao perceiving everything clearly throughout the entire process of cultivating the technique...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan decisively sealed it and put it aside.</p><p></p><p>After roughly going through a few techniques, Li Fan then focused his attention on the two techniques he saw for the first time.</p><p></p><p>The "Sitting in Oblivion Secret Classic" and the "Three Perils Ghost God Dark Secrecy Record".</p><p></p><p>"The previous few techniques came from the giant man named Sikong Lin among the Twelve Dharma Kings."</p><p></p><p>The faces of the twelve distinctive cultivators of the Xuantian Sect flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Soon, based on the style of the techniques, Li Fan locked onto the possible source.</p><p></p><p>"Sun Xingwang."</p><p></p><p>Because the temperament revealed by these two techniques was truly too unique.</p><p></p><p>Take the "Sitting in Oblivion Secret Classic" for example. This technique had some similarities with the abilities of the former Xuantian King.</p><p></p><p>They both had a divine power similar to "words becoming reality".</p><p></p><p>The difference was that the "words" of Xuantian King Xuanyuan Hong acted upon himself.</p><p></p><p>For example, "Body Giant Strength", "Walking the Heavenly Dao", and so on.</p><p></p><p>While the "Sitting in Oblivion Secret Classic" acted upon all other things in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>When cultivated to a profound level, it could even...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It is even possible to reshape the entire world through the delusional words of the cultivation method, according to one's own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>For example, there is an instance in the cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>The mark of mastering the "Sitting in Oblivion Secret Classic" is to create a non-existent character out of thin air through delusional words.</p><p></p><p>As the settings for this person become more and more detailed, this character will truly be born.</p><p></p><p>And they will act according to the established rules.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they will not have any sense of the creator behind them.</p><p></p><p>The wonders of the "Sitting in Oblivion Secret Classic" made Li Fan exclaim in surprise again and again.</p><p></p><p>However, just like the "Heaven and Earth Confrontation Rhapsody", the "Sitting in Oblivion Secret Classic" also has a very strong side effect.</p><p></p><p>That is, every hundred years, the cultivator of the method will completely lose all memories except for the contents of the "Sitting in Oblivion Secret Classic".</p><p></p><p>And they will actively ignore any previously left textual records or hints.</p><p></p><p>In other words, even if the "Sitting in Oblivion Secret Classic" is cultivated to the highest realm, and the entire world may all be their creation.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator of the method himself is completely unaware of this.</p><p></p><p>Forever starting a new life every hundred years.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The one who invented this 'Sitting in Oblivion Secret Classic' must also be an earth-shattering talent."</p><p></p><p>"The Three Perils Ghost God Underworld Record".</p><p></p><p>This cultivation method is the most unique.</p><p></p><p>It is a summoning technique.</p><p></p><p>What it summons is not something from another realm, but the [Ghosts] and [Gods] within one's own body.</p><p></p><p>According to the explanation of the cultivation method, every person is born with endless thoughts.</p><p></p><p>These thoughts are like waves on the sea.</p><p></p><p>Basically, they are all fleeting.</p><p></p><p>But it is these waves that make up the vast sea of [Human].</p><p></p><p>If every thought that is born is preserved and nourished day and night to grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>Then countless thought essences will be born in one's own sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The [Ghosts] and [Gods] that take shape according to the nature and content of the thoughts themselves.</p><p></p><p>The so-called three perils are also the three: human, ghost, and god.</p><p></p><p>Because these ghosts and gods all originate from oneself, the three are all interconnected.</p><p></p><p>And as the power of [Human] continues to grow, the power of [Ghosts] and [Gods] will also expand a thousand times.</p><p></p><p>Once a thought is released, it is as if the underworld is recreated in the human world.</p><p></p><p>Darkness envelops, and souls run rampant.</p><p></p><p>With deliberate indulgence, using a single thought to destroy the entire world and transform all other living beings into one's own ghosts and gods is not difficult.</p><p></p><p>This "Three Perils Ghost God Underworld Record" does not have any particularly strong side effects.</p><p></p><p>If one must say, the countless ghosts and gods that exist within the body at all times, with their different whispers, are probably the only negative factor.</p><p></p><p>If the mind is not firm, it is really possible to drive oneself crazy.</p><p></p><p>And even if the will is strong, facing the endless chatter of countless ghosts and gods day and night, there will always be a day when one can't take it anymore.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the person who cultivates this method will go berserk.</p><p></p><p>Releasing countless ghosts and gods to destroy the world.</p><p></p><p>However, this "Three Perils Ghost God Underworld Record", when paired with the "Sitting in Oblivion Secret Classic", has unexpected effects.</p><p></p><p>The memory deletion every hundred years sweeps away the accumulation of negative emotions brought by the countless ghosts and gods.</p><p></p><p>But those countless ghosts and gods themselves will not disappear.</p><p></p><p>Even if one can't remember the "Three Perils Ghost God Underworld Record" cultivation method, nurturing the thought of ghosts and gods itself has already become a physical instinct.</p><p></p><p>Just like this, as time passes, one's own strength will also continue to increase.</p><p></p><p>"However, I remember Sun Xingwang once said that cultivating these two methods together has other unexpected points of rejection."</p>

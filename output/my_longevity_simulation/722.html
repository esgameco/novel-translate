        <h1>Chapter 722</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>But this time, the falling corpses he encountered were obviously different in appearance.</p><p></p><p>So he quickly realized that it wasn't the "Retrieve the Rain" technique.</p><p></p><p>It was the "Million Corpses Giant" they had encountered before, disintegrating.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, Huangfu Song also disappeared in an instant with Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Frowning: "What's going on again? Did the Immortal Alliance happen to attack the giant corpse?"</p><p></p><p>He and Dongfang Yao were puzzled, but Li Fan vaguely guessed the reason.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a sign of the reversal of life and death principles?" Li Fan's heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>"Calculating the days, even if Lan Yu can take more longevity treasures, it's almost time for his lifespan to come to an end."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that he ultimately chose this path. However, in a short period of time, he has already been able to resolve the concrete manifestation of the reversal of life and death..."</p><p></p><p>"Is Lan Yu that strong?"</p><p></p><p>A trace of doubt flashed in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Or, is there another force helping him?"</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Bai is still not very clear about how the reversal of the principles of heaven and earth and its impact on all things in the world are actually achieved.</p><p></p><p>But what is happening now, the giant corpse that can move freely disintegrating in an instant, is undoubtedly an indication that two diametrically opposed forces are in conflict.</p><p></p><p>"It may not necessarily indicate that Lan Yu has gained the upper hand in the confrontation between the two. It can only be said that the Eternal Longevity God, who reverses life and death, may also have been caught off guard by Lan Yu's counterattack. After all, He had just reversed the principles recently and may not have completed the steps of the 'thesis' yet."</p><p></p><p>"The gap between not truly entering the state of Eternal Longevity and attaining the Dao doesn't seem as huge as imagined."</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's contemplation, the rain of corpses finally came to a gradual end.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song and Dongfang Yao looked at the numerous corpses disappearing into the depths of the white mist with uncertain expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Darn it, the white mist is getting weirder." Dongfang Yao muttered under his breath.</p><p></p><p>After a brief rest, the three continued to advance into the white mist, searching for traces of the mysterious domain.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in Tianliangzhou, Xu Bai, who was chatting happily with envoys from other states, suddenly found an excuse to leave.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Tianxuan Mirror, he began searching for any clues related to the "struggle against the principles of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>In silence, there seemed to be no abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>But that was exactly the biggest anomaly.</p><p></p><p>Even the depths of the white mist were affected by the struggle between the two parties, let alone within the Xuanhuang Realm?</p><p></p><p>There were bound to be events that went against common sense, but were deliberately concealed by the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Xu Bai left the Tianxuan Mirror and contacted Liu San.</p><p></p><p>He instructed Liu San to temporarily stop alchemy and ordered the disciples of the Medicine King Sect in various regions to investigate if anything strange was happening around them.</p><p></p><p>The consciousnesses of the Medicine King Sect disciples were connected through the Great Dream Spring and Autumn Formation, and their actions were swift.</p><p></p><p>In less than half a day, news from various states kept flowing to Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>"A cultivator rushed out of the white mist, going mad, launching indiscriminate attacks on everything he saw, and fearlessly facing death. Before the Immortal Alliance cultivators could kill him, he collapsed on his own. Upon inspection, it was discovered that the cultivator had long turned into a corpse."</p><p></p><p>"In Tianlinzhou, a Jindan cultivator died suddenly during the foundation building process. The phenomenon of falling from the sky had already appeared, and his friends were about to collect his body. However, this person suddenly came back to life. The phenomenon suddenly stopped, and the clouds in the sky seemed unwilling to disperse."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting..." Xu Bai's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>"In Taihuazhou, there is a pair of Dao companions. The wife had long been deceased, but the husband always refused to accept the fact, keeping his beloved wife's body preserved in ice. Not long ago, this man suddenly appeared with a female cultivator in front of everyone. Initially, it was thought that he had finally come to terms and found a new companion. But upon closer inspection, it was found that the female cultivator beside him was actually his deceased wife from many years ago! However, her eyes seemed vacant and her actions were abnormal. She also did not remember old friends from her lifetime."</p><p></p><p>…辝</p><p></p><p>As Xu Bai read on, his expression gradually became serious.</p><p></p><p>Because, in addition to the initial rumors of people who seemed to be alive but lost control suddenly, more and more instances of the dead coming back to life were happening.</p><p></p><p>It was not limited to one state; the entire territory of the Immortal Alliance was experiencing this.</p><p></p><p>"Even beyond the Immortal Alliance, including the Five Elders' Gathering..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's expression turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Is this due to Lan Yu's intervention, that the Eternal Longevity God has begun to accelerate the pace of the 'thesis'?" </p><p></p><p>As far as Xu Bai knew, there weren't any signs of battles in the Source Dao Zhou where Lan Yu was located.</p><p></p><p>"Without fighting, directly resolving this competitor. Instead, crushing him with the momentum of reversing the principles."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai squinted his eyes, "It seems that this Eternal Longevity God didn't really care about Lan Yu. He didn't even seem interested in making a move against him."</p><p></p><p>"He just needs to proceed step by step with his own journey to attain eternal life, and for Lan Yu blocking his path, he's truly like an arm blocking a car. He will only meet a crushing end."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai seemed to hear Lan Yu's roar of anger after failing the enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the outcome will come soon. Just need to be patient and wait."</p><p></p><p>Continuing to let the disciples of the Medicine King Sect gather information, and to prevent external disturbances, Xu Bai simply blocked the communication talisman again.</p><p></p><p>As expected, more and more instances of the dead coming back to life made the Immortal Alliance cultivators increasingly alert.</p><p></p><p>Discussions of fear and doubt grew, eventually leading to a declaration from the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivators of the Immortal Alliance, remember this great day."</p><p></p><p>"After many years, our Immortal Alliance is about to welcome a new Eternal Longevity God."</p><p></p><p>"People cannot be resurrected once dead, this is the heavenly principle."</p><p></p><p>"But from now on, this established fact will be completely rewritten."</p><p></p><p>"Inverting the principles of life and death, the Eternal Longevity God is named [Rebirth]."</p><p></p><p>"So, do not panic. Celebrate to your heart's content."</p><p></p><p>"Under the protection of the Rebirth Eternal God, fallen cultivators can be resurrected after eighteen years. And they can retain their memories from their past life."</p><p></p><p>"A new era is dawning!"</p><p></p><p>After the announcement, all cultivators worldwide fell into a state of shock.</p><p></p><p>Then came vibrations, doubt, fear...</p><p></p><p>Various emotions erupted.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance divisions in each state were crowded with cultivators.</p><p></p><p>They were eager to know the details of rebirth and how resurrection would occur.</p><p></p><p>But officials from various regions were also clueless about the matter.</p><p></p><p>So they could only try to maintain order and wait for the day when the answers would be revealed.</p>

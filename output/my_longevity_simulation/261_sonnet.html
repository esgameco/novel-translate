        <h1>Chapter 261</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained motionless in the Heavenly Mystery Mirror, calmly awaiting the result. </p><p></p><p>Three months later, there was still no particular progress in the exploration of the ruins.</p><p></p><p>However, He Zhenghao excitedly sent a message first.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist friend Li Fan, good news."</p><p></p><p>"After some effort on my part, I have secured three potential positions in different states." </p><p></p><p>"Daoist friend, please advise me."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately replied: "Oh? Let me hear it."</p><p></p><p>"The first is the leader of the Martial Arts Hall in Taihua State."</p><p></p><p>"Taihua State is not far from the Cong Yun Sea. There is the Taihua Mountain Range running across the entire state, also known as the 'state on the mountain ridge'."</p><p></p><p>"With towering peaks too numerous to count, my cultivation speed there would be much faster compared to the Cong Yun Sea."</p><p></p><p>"The second is a staff officer in the Strategy Formation Hall of Qingwei State." </p><p></p><p>"Although Qingwei State is still quite far south of Tianyu State, it's much closer compared to the Cong Yun Sea."</p><p></p><p>"The third is the garrison commander of Tian Yun State."</p><p></p><p>"This Tian Yun State is not far west of Tianyu State. Therefore, the competition for this position is extremely fierce."</p><p></p><p>"Being transferred there would just be a lateral move to a city garrison commander position."</p><p></p><p>"The advantage is being closer to the headquarters of the Myriad Immortal Alliance, so promotions would be easier than other places."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao slowly laid out the results of his efforts during this period.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Yun State..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, then replied: "Don't make a decision hastily. I have an acquainted cultivator in Tian Yun State, let me inquire further to see if we can advance this."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, He Zhenghao was very surprised: "Daoist friend, you even have connections in Tian Yun State?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I can't guarantee it. Let me try first, Daoist friend wait for my message." Li Fan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao repeatedly agreed. </p><p></p><p>So Li Fan contacted Shen Yuzi and explained the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, do you have a way?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Yuzi only replied: "I'll ask around for you."</p><p></p><p>And there was no further response.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not in a hurry either, patiently waiting.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, a cultivator named Jing Xuan Daoren requested to add Li Fan as a friend.</p><p></p><p>He was also from Tian Yun State.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart stirred and he quickly accepted.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xuan's hearty voice came through.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, is this young friend Li Fan? I heard from Shen Yu that you have a friend who wants to take up a position in our Tian Yun State?"</p><p></p><p>"The Four Dings Golden Dan, tsk tsk, a formidable junior!"</p><p></p><p>"So, ask him if he's interested in joining our Tian Yun State's Garrison Institute?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, because of that great battle a few years ago, there are still some vacant positions that haven't been filled."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly taken aback and couldn't help asking: "Senior Jing Xuan, I don't know what this Garrison Institute is..."</p><p></p><p>Jing Xuan was also stunned.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect Li Fan to be completely unaware of what the Garrison Institute was.</p><p></p><p>But he soon realized that Li Fan came from a remote place, and understood, explaining: "The Garrison Institute is a unique organization in the heartland of the Myriad Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"It reports directly to the headquarters of the Myriad Immortal Alliance. Its main responsibility is to suppress demonic cultivators and guard the stability of the heartland."</p><p></p><p>"When necessary, it will also heed emergency orders to go to other states for battle."</p><p></p><p>With Jing Xuan's explanation, Li Fan understood.</p><p></p><p>It was essentially the same as the garrison troops stationed outside Xuanjing City under Da Xuan's command before, only taking orders from Li Fan to guard the safety of the city.</p><p></p><p>"It should be considered an important position."</p><p></p><p>"However, it seems to require frequent combat. I don't know if He Zhenghao's current temperament would be willing to accept it."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, bid farewell to Jing Xuan, and then contacted He Zhenghao again to explain the situation.</p><p></p><p>"The Garrison Institute?" This time, He Zhenghao was truly shocked.</p><p></p><p>In his youth, he had stayed in Tianyu State for a while, so he naturally understood what the Garrison Institute was.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Law Enforcement Hall, it was an organization that took orders directly from the headquarters of the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Only below the Law Enforcement Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist friend Li Fan is truly unfathomable, actually able to secure this position."</p><p></p><p>"Although it's a bit dangerous, but..."</p><p></p><p>An elegant figure flashed through He Zhenghao's mind.</p><p></p><p>He immediately gritted his teeth and agreed.</p><p></p><p>After learning of He Zhenghao's determination, Li Fan also replied to Daoren Jing Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"Jing Xuan was very pleased.</p><p></p><p>"Have your friend come to our Tian Yun State first as a garrison commander."</p><p></p><p>"After three years of service and accumulating experience, I will pull some strings to have him transferred into the Garrison Institute."</p><p></p><p>Next, Jing Xuan carefully gave some additional reminders before ending the communication.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan relayed everything to He Zhenghao word for word.</p><p></p><p>After carefully listening, He Zhenghao hurriedly made preparations for his future.</p><p></p><p>The tranquil Li Fan thought for a moment. Although the matter was not settled yet, he still transferred 100,000 contribution points to Shen Yuzi and Jing Xuan each as a token of gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he recorded this expense under He Zhenghao's name.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>In Tian Yun State.</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving the contribution points, Shen Yuzi was slightly taken aback and laughed wryly.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xuan immediately sent a message inquiring: "Old Shen Yu, did you receive Li's transfer of contribution points? 100,000 contribution points, I remember he's only at the Foundation Establishment realm. What a generous hand!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Yuzi smiled and replied: "At least he's more generous than us when we were at the Foundation Establishment realm."</p><p></p><p>"I only passed on a message, yet received the same reward as you, Jing Xuan. Aren't you upset?"</p><p></p><p>Jing Xuan laughed heartily: "Hahaha, sharing the water evenly, this little kid is quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad. I find him more likable than old Guangwu."</p><p></p><p>"Messing it up? Looking down on who?" Jing Xuan snorted coldly, then fell silent.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Three months later, He Zhenghao's transfer order came through.</p><p></p><p>There were no issues.</p><p></p><p>Garrison Commander of Guangan Town, Tian Yun State.</p><p></p><p>For this, a total of 80,000 contribution points were spent, front and back.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, it was borrowed from Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Of course, He Zhenghao had no qualms about being in debt, feeling no mental burden.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was also very generous, lending as much as needed.</p><p></p><p>Before departing, He Zhenghao vowed solemnly.</p><p></p><p>After establishing himself in Tian Yun State, he would try to arrange for Li Fan to be transferred there as well.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't say much, only patting He Zhenghao's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>After He Zhenghao left, Li Fan remained in the Heavenly Mystery Mirror every day, never going out, diligently cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Soon, time came to the anchored 23rd year.</p><p></p><p>That soaring ruin was finally discovered.</p><p></p><p>However, it had landed in a vast marshland in the center of Jiu Shan State.</p><p></p><p>When cultivators began exploring it, the origins of this ruin were also uncovered.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Immortal Sect, Zhaoyuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>Although not as renowned as sects like Taoist or Dadao, whose fame was still known to all even thousands of years later.</p><p></p><p>Before the great catastrophe, it was still a famous major sect.</p><p></p><p>Based on past experience exploring sect ruins, this place must contain abundant treasures.</p><p></p><p>When the news spread, it immediately attracted many cultivators to venture to Jiu Shan State for exploration.</p><p></p><p>The already chaotic Jiu Shan State became even more tumultuous.</p><p></p><p>The extent of arrogance was quite evident.</p><p></p><p>It also showed how weak the Myriad Immortal Alliance's control over Jiu Shan State was.</p><p></p><p>Originally, it was just a normal ruin exploration, which the Myriad Immortal Alliance didn't intend to interfere with much.</p><p></p><p>But at this time, a piece of news came that enraged the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>One of the Five Elders Council's Celestial Immortals named Luo Xi came to explore the ruins.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he make no attempt to conceal his identity as a Five Elders cultivator, he even took advantage of his profound cultivation to injure and kill many Myriad Immortal Alliance explorers.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining some unknown treasures deep in the ruins, he left arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>Doing this so brazenly on our turf?</p><p></p><p>It was simply a slap in the face.</p><p></p><p>However, doubts also arose.</p><p></p><p>Such conduct clearly had provocative intentions.</p><p></p><p>Could the Five Elders Council be trying to start another war?</p><p></p><p>Regardless, they could not lose face.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Immortal Alliance swiftly dispatched several Celestial Immortals to Jiu Shan State to take command.</p><p></p><p>And issued a stern warning.</p><p></p><p>Prohibiting any Five Elders Council cultivators from entering Jiu Shan State.</p><p></p><p>If they dared to come, it would mean death!</p>

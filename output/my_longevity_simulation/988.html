            <p>"What's the difference between the stone statue and the real person?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Baihau Daoren's words, Li Fan's heart couldn't help but skip a beat.</p><p></p><p>The originally still and silent stone statue of the Faceless True Immortal seemed to move in an instant.</p><p></p><p>It looked at Li Fan with a slightly mocking and dark gaze...</p><p></p><p>However, when Li Fan looked again, all the strange phenomena disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>It became like an ordinary stone statue again.</p><p></p><p>The information revealed in Baihua Daoren's words was too frightening. It made the shocked Li Fan want to return to his true form on the spot!</p><p></p><p>But the current Li Taishi was no longer the small foundation-building cultivator who was forced to return to his true form in a sorry state after being found by the Heavenly Doctor through his avatar's connection!</p><p></p><p>If he was scared into directly returning to his true form by someone's words of unknown truth, that would be the real joke!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes slightly, and scenes of his experiences in this life flashed quickly in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Then his heart calmed down a bit.</p><p></p><p>When the scenes of believers praying appeared in Li Fan's mind, he had already determined that the Faceless True Immortal stone statue was related to the Faceless True Immortal who had saved the Profound Heavenly King back then, and that the statue still possessed part of a True Immortal's power.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the statue, connecting with believers, and even directly bestowing cultivation out of thin air, and then absorbing golden power of wishes...</p><p></p><p>If such things were said to be just the effect of an ordinary statue, without the power of that Faceless True Immortal to maintain it, it would be a bit hard to justify.</p><p></p><p>But at that time, Li Fan was still harboring a fluke in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have the guts to face a True Immortal directly, but he had the guts to take advantage of the residual power left by a True Immortal to fleece some benefits.</p><p></p><p>"I still underestimated the strength of a True Immortal. Where their power reaches, it's as if they are personally present..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had still fallen into a misunderstanding in his thinking, using the perspective of an ordinary cultivator to speculate about the abilities of a True Immortal.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's original view, this True Immortal statue was equivalent to a formation that could enhance the sensing of the Formless Killing Intent. The True Immortal could sense many things happening around the statue at any time through it.</p><p></p><p>But now this conclusion had been overturned.</p><p></p><p>This statue was equivalent to the True Immortal being personally present!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, even with Li Fan's firm will far surpassing ordinary people, he couldn't help but feel an intangible heavy pressure.</p><p></p><p>After all, deceiving superiors and subordinates was a completely different concept from courting death right under their nose.</p><p></p><p>But after some pondering, Li Fan still endured this pressure and did not rashly return to his true form.</p><p></p><p>There were three reasons.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, even if the statue was like the True Immortal being present, from the time Li Fan dug out the statue until now, he had never exposed his secret of possessing [Return to Truth]. In the eyes of the True Immortal, he was just a slightly stronger Yuan Ying stage cultivator, borrowing the name of the Mortal World Compassion Immortal to seek benefits. Even at the Eternal Life stage, he might not catch the True Immortal's attention, let alone him, Li Fan? Would mortals be curious why a flying ant in an anthill was stronger than the others? If that Faceless True Immortal could really perceive everything happening here, and Li Fan was still living well now, that was the best proof that he had not yet attracted the True Immortal's attention.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, it was not the first time the Faceless statue appeared in the Profound Yellow Realm. During the reign of the Profound Heaven Sect, the statues were almost all over the Profound Yellow Realm. Later, the Ten Great Immortal Sects betrayed and the Profound Heaven Sect was destroyed. Countless statues were damaged, leaving only the last one collected by Mr. Bai. During this process, the Faceless True Immortal remained unmoved and did not show any signs of</p><p></p><p>The passage suggests that the true immortals of the realm are not concerned with the affairs of the mortal world, and that unless one displays power at the level of an immortal, they are not worthy of being "seen" by the true immortals. So even though there may be a lot of commotion on Li Fan's side, it is essentially nothing to the true immortals.</p><p></p><p>The last point, which is also the main basis for Li Fan's ultimate decision to temporarily not return to reality and continue to observe, is the existence of the immortals of the Immortal Ruins and the "High Wall".</p><p></p><p>The immortals of the Immortal Ruins have been sitting in the ruins and comprehending the Dao for nearly 10,000 years. If there were beings with power equal to them in the nearby mortal world, how could the immortals of the Immortal Ruins have been able to peacefully comprehend the Dao for such a long time?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan does not believe that the principle of not allowing others to sleep peacefully by one's bedside no longer applies at the level of immortals!</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, there is the High Wall. Whether the High Wall was built by the immortals of the Immortal Ruins or by those outside the wall, its ability to filter and block at the level of immortals has been confirmed.</p><p></p><p>Being inside and outside the High Wall will definitely have a certain degree of impact on one's perception, and it will definitely not be the same as personally going there.</p><p></p><p>"If that Faceless True Immortal senses something unusual and comes across the High Wall..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid it would immediately alert the immortals of the Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>"When two tigers meet, there must be a fight. I will also have ample time to return to reality."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan weighed his options and made a decision.</p><p></p><p>"It looks very dangerous, but because the power gap between the two sides is so great, it's not as dangerous as imagined."</p><p></p><p>"As long as [Returning to Reality] is not exposed."</p><p></p><p>"But then again, if I didn't possess [Returning to Reality] myself, I wouldn't have thought that there really exists such a treasure in the world that can turn the real into the illusory and reverse everything."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As his thoughts slowly converged, Li Fan looked at the terrified Baihua Daoist in front of him and smiled slightly, "Daoist Baihua only knows one thing but not the other."</p><p></p><p>"Mundane affairs, why would true immortals be interested in them under normal circumstances?"</p><p></p><p>"The many affairs of this mortal world, I will relieve the true immortals of their worries on their behalf."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan spoke calmly, as if to prove his point, the golden karmic body filled with willpower slowly flew out from within him.</p><p></p><p>Then, he lightly pointed at Baihua Daoist's forehead.</p><p></p><p>The moment the golden karmic body appeared, Baihua Daoist's figure shook violently like a lake surface blown by a gale.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sensed many emotions from her, such as "terror", "greed", and "fear".</p><p></p><p>"Sure enough..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this in his heart, Li Fan slowly controlled and injected a wisp of golden willpower from the karmic body into Baihua Daoist's body.</p><p></p><p>As the golden willpower entered her body, Baihua Daoist couldn't help but let out a moan.</p><p></p><p>On her originally unclear face, a devastatingly beautiful countenance suddenly appeared as if the clouds had parted to reveal the sun.</p><p></p><p>However, the original noble aura had disappeared, and her eyes were dazed as she stared blankly at the finger of the golden karmic body pressed against her brow.</p><p></p><p>Pleading and desire came gushing forth.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, it was beyond words.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan's state of mind rippled slightly.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he saw a peony of national beauty, its glamour surpassing all the flowers in the world, slowly blooming in front of him and fully releasing its beauty.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph."</p><p></p><p>Faced with Baihua Daoist's plea, Li Fan's mind became firm in an instant after withdrawing the golden karmic body.</p><p></p><p>He looked coldly at Baihua Daoist's empty and resentful eyes as a warning.</p>

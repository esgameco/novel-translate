        <h1>Chapter 1298</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Sun Erlang, as the great disciple of the Holy Dynasty, commanded all affairs of the Holy Dynasty in the absence of the Holy Emperor. üëç‚ò∫‚ùª‚ùæùï§ƒ§ÔΩï–ñ.ùìí√ò–ºüå∑‚òÖ Naturally, no one would refute his pre-battle summary and mobilization.</p><p></p><p>After several more days of infiltrating the white fog, a beam of light tore through the sky and flew into the Puxian True Boat. </p><p></p><p>It was a message from an unknown source.</p><p></p><p>After squinting to read it, Sun Erlang was shocked: "Received definite information that the Myriad Immortal Alliance will launch a battle to recover the Nine Mountains Prefecture tomorrow. At the same time, in order to intimidate the Five Elders Society, they will also launch small-scale harassment battles in multiple border prefectures..."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the eyes of the Holy Dynasty members present lit up: "The Immortal Alliance's actions are even greater than we anticipated!"</p><p></p><p>"Fight! The fiercer the better!"</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Sun Erlang, the huge light sphere representing the Myriad Immortal Alliance's territory map instantly appeared in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>"The moment the Myriad Immortal Alliance's battle to recover the Nine Mountains erupts is the time for the Holy Dynasty's army to attack."</p><p></p><p>"Before then, you must not act rashly."</p><p></p><p>In the time it took Sun Erlang to speak, he had already cooperated with Ou Shangtian to activate the Puxian True Boat's internal lockdown formation. </p><p></p><p>"Before the decisive battle, I have one more top secret matter to announce. It concerns victory or defeat, so it absolutely cannot be leaked. Therefore, during this time, the warship needs to be sealed off, allowed in but not out, and any communications will be cut off."</p><p></p><p>"Please understand." Sun Erlang said lightly.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's eyes flashed with a hint of surprise, not understanding what kind of secret content required such prudence.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang closed his eyes and waited.</p><p></p><p>In the solemn environment, the inside of the Puxian True Boat also fell into absolute silence. </p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Sun Erlang suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Immortal Alliance has made their move."</p><p></p><p>"Now, it's our turn."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang suddenly stood up and bowed towards the void in front: "Greetings, Master!"</p><p></p><p>The people on the flying boat were startled and looked in the direction Sun Erlang bowed, only to see the Holy Emperor's figure descending under the starlight.</p><p></p><p>"Welcome the Holy Emperor!" Everyone bowed in unison.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was just a virtual image and not the true body actually appearing, they did not dare show the slightest negligence.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor did not say any grand, empty words, only solemnly declaring: "In this battle, the Holy Dynasty will surely be victorious."</p><p></p><p>Then with a wave of his hand, the Holy Emperor's image turned into specks of starlight, flying into the bodies of the cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Everyone seemed to transform into a planet, arriving in the vast sea of stars.</p><p></p><p>Revolving around the huge central star that was like the great sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Even more wonderfully, a vast stellar force seemed to reverberate in the starry sea, like a woven star net, connecting everyone.</p><p></p><p>Even without words or divine sense, they could communicate at will through the flow of thoughts.</p><p></p><p>They also discovered that the stars in the starry sea did not only include this group of people currently in the Puxian True Boat.</p><p></p><p>"I make the following deployments."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's voice echoed in the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>"Wang Xuanba, Elder Qiaogong, lead the 1st and 3rd army corps to besiege the 130 eastern states of the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Ou Shangtian, Ou Daozi, lead the 2nd and 9th army corps, responsible for the 126 southern states of the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Su Yuqing, Elder Baihua, lead the 5th army corps and the Myriad Realm Allied Forces to attack the 154 western states of the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>With each of Sun Erlang's deployment tasks completed, Wang Xuanba and the others noticed their positions in the starry sea rapidly shifting. After settling in a whole new star domain, they simultaneously established connections with the other planets in this region.</p><p></p><p>With a slight thought, detailed information about the main generals of the army corps under their command appeared in their minds.</p><p></p><p>"The combat objective is to focus on capturing the celestial cities of each state. For the other cultivator family forces in the states, if there are resisters, eliminate them along the way. If they choose to wait and see, they can be temporarily ignored."</p><p></p><p>"When the war begins, the Celestial Mystic Mirrors and transmission formations in each state of the Immortal Alliance will be paralyzed..."</p><p></p><p>"This is the defensive formation diagram of the Immortal Alliance's celestial cities. Break the formations according to the notes in the diagram. Those defenses are like nothing to us. If the backup formations are activated, I will also immediately convey the method to exploit their flaws."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The information was conveyed in an orderly manner. The crowd looked at the information in their hands with increasing excitement.</p><p></p><p>Not only did it include a list of the main cultivators deployed in each state, it even clearly marked their respective realms, strengths, and even cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>The details of their opponents were almost completely laid bare.</p><p></p><p>Yet the Myriad Immortal Alliance knew almost nothing about them.</p><p></p><p>How could they lose this battle?</p><p></p><p>No wonder Sun Erlang was so solemn before. The information at hand must have been leaked by high-level members of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>However, the shock brought by Sun Erlang was not over yet.</p><p></p><p>"The star net you see now is a manifestation of the Holy Emperor's great power. In addition to the simplest communication function, you can also use the Holy Emperor's power to instantly transfer to each other's side."</p><p></p><p>"You can take advantage of this to outnumber the enemy and annihilate them one by one."</p><p></p><p>The bright star at the center of the starry sea suddenly erupted with a dazzling light, shining on the myriad stars.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the various applications of the Holy Emperor's power appeared in detail in everyone's minds.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but marvel at the greatness of the Holy Emperor once again.</p><p></p><p>While the pre-war general meeting was still in progress, in the Lingxu Realm.</p><p></p><p>"There shouldn't be a problem, right?" Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong looked at the wheel-like pattern engraved on the open space in front.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, seniors. When I, Cui Shaojiang, take action, it will surely be foolproof!" A youth wearing a blue round hat smiled and guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>Cui Shaojiang squeezed out a drop of his essence blood and waved it towards the open space ahead.</p><p></p><p>After the essence blood merged into the ground wheel, it erupted with blood-colored thin threads. Then they rapidly flew towards the sky and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, in today's Beast Taming Sect, I'm the only one left who knows this unique skill." Cui Shaojiang explained with a smug look.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong looked at the wheel pattern on the ground with some suspicion. They did not sense any binding or restraining power from it.</p><p></p><p>Cui Shaojiang seemed to see through their distrust and patiently explained: "The Beast Taming Sect of today is different from the past. After the great calamity back then, we relocated here. In the following thousand years, we gradually abandoned the traditional beast taming methods and turned to the art of 'Beast Spirit Unity'."</p><p></p><p>As Cui Shaojiang spoke, the blue round hat on his head suddenly came alive, growing two round black eyes that sized up Qing and Hong.</p><p></p><p>Even though they had some prior knowledge of the Beast Taming Sect's situation, Qing and Hong still found it a bit unbelievable to witness it firsthand.</p><p></p><p>In their perception, there were not two separate auras of beast and human, but from beginning to end, there was only one person in front of them.</p><p></p><p>"Not controlling with techniques, but fusing with spirit. This was the breakthrough of our Beast Taming Sect ancestors after researching the Beast Taming Wheel. Speaking of which, Senior Xu Ke also contributed to this." He touched the top of his head, and the blue round hat returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>"I digress. Back to this Beast Taming Wheel. The replica sent by Senior Xu Ke is indeed excellent. Coupled with our Beast Taming Sect's technological accumulation over a thousand years, it is enough to unleash the power of the real Beast Taming Wheel back then and summon Emperor Sanmao here..."</p><p></p><p>A hint of excitement flashed in Cui Shaojiang's eyes: "We are quite looking forward to this legendary intelligent beast. If we could fuse with his spirit..."</p><p></p><p>Cui Shaojiang's gaze inadvertently drifted outside the open space, where the Beast Taming Sect had already laid out a heavenly net.</p><p></p><p>The memories of this beast who left the sect without a word were not forgotten by the Beast Taming Sect over time. Instead, they became even more unforgettable.</p><p></p><p>So when Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong came with the replica Beast Taming Wheel to persuade them this time, they naturally hit it off right away.</p><p></p><p>On the ground, the red light wriggled like it had a life of its own. The wheel pattern even trembled slightly as if it would leap up from the ground at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Cui Shaojiang narrowed his eyes. He felt that Emperor Sanmao had taken the bait.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Immortal Alliance Headquarters.</p><p></p><p>While waiting and pretending to tour around, Xu Ke and Yin Shangren suddenly noticed that the Divine Treasure Museum seemed to brighten a bit in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The slight heaviness pressing on their hearts also suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Sanmao has left." Xu Ke immediately made the judgment.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a bit longer. Wait for the Holy Emperor's side..."</p><p></p><p>"The Beast Taming Sect's breakthroughs in recent years have surprised even me. When the great calamity arrived back then, they chose to retreat and preserve a large number of talents, which turned out to be useful." Xu Ke said.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, waiting it is then. It's not a big deal to wait a bit longer. By the way, come take a look at this..."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren pulled Xu Ke in front of an exhibit.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke took a close look and saw that it was a golden tree with a rather peculiar shape.</p><p></p><p>The leaves were all triangular, and the trunk was carved with small figures communicating in various different poses.</p><p></p><p>"This thing isn't an ancient artifact from the Xuanhuang Realm, right?" Xu Ke said with a somewhat strange expression after looking for a while.</p><p></p><p>"Of course not. It comes from my homeland."</p><p></p><p>"Or rather, the homeland where my residual consciousness is most complete."</p><p></p><p>"I originally thought nothing would be left of that place, but I never expected the most important golden tree to be preserved in this Divine Treasure Museum." Yin Shangren said in a leisurely tone.</p><p></p><p>"Does this tree have any profound mysteries?" Xu Ke knew that Yin Shangren definitely wouldn't reminisce about old matters with him for no reason, so he immediately had a thought and asked.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren chuckled: "In our world, there was no sun or moon. The light of the entire world relied on this single golden tree. Even the birth of all life originated from under this tree. As you can see, the patterns on the tree are the imprints of human communication under the tree over the years."</p><p></p><p>"Although the world was destroyed, as long as this tree exists, almost a third of the world's source power is preserved."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke somewhat understood, then said with a hint of surprise: "You have a way to detonate the energy inside this tree?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren rubbed his scalp and smiled without answering.</p><p></p><p>"You're willing? That's your homeland. If this tree is well preserved, after the Holy Emperor conquers the Myriad Immortal Alliance headquarters, you could ask him to take action. It might be possible to recreate that world." Xu Ke said.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren snorted coldly: "Everyone is dead. Even if the world is recreated, so what? Do I transform into their appearance and put on a one-man show?"</p><p></p><p>"Just blow it up then."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke responded with a smile.</p><p></p><p>As the two were talking, they suddenly felt the ground beneath their feet gently shaking. They looked at each other, then raised their heads to look outside the Divine Treasure Museum. Although their vision could not penetrate, they could vaguely sense that a drastic change had descended upon the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Their intuition was not wrong.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a strange scene was unfolding in the sky of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The originally bright sky suddenly darkened as if night had fallen.</p><p></p><p>The great sun in the sky disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the twinkling stars, a bright moon rose.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the Xuanhuang cultivators discovered that this "bright moon" was even more luminous than the original sun.</p><p></p><p>As the huge jade disc slowly approached, the Xuanhuang Realm became dark and then bright again.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators looked up at the sky and found that there were countless tall towers standing in this bright moon.</p><p></p><p>It was like a whole other world!</p><p></p><p>After a brief mental blank, countless thoughts instantly surfaced in the minds of the Xuanhuang cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Could this be the legendary Xuanxian Boat?"</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanxian Boat is attacking?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard the Immortal Alliance and the Five Elders Society are at war. Could it be a surprise attack by the Five Elders Society?"</p><p></p><p>"Be on guard!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When things are abnormal, there must be something strange going on.</p><p></p><p>Now in the war preparation stage, the Myriad Immortal Alliance</p><p></p><p>The reaction was not slow.</p><p></p><p>The great formations protecting the celestial cities in each state were directly activated, and alarms resounded through the sky.</p><p></p><p>There were even cultivators who transformed into beams of white light, flying straight towards the Bright Moon World in the sky, wanting to investigate.</p><p></p><p>But even though it looked close at hand, that investigating cultivator was unable to fly into it no matter what.</p><p></p><p>It was as if there was an insurmountable chasm in between.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Immortals Alliance was on high alert, but then they saw several rays of bright light shining down from the Bright Moon.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight was like blades, accurately piercing the borders between the four central states of the Immortal Alliance: Tianyu, Tianchen, Tianshu, and Tianquan.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the skies above the four central states of the Immortal Alliance seemed to be plated with a layer of silver radiance, becoming illusory and hazy.</p><p></p><p>But other than that, there didn't seem to be any other abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>After waiting cautiously for a long time, the cultivators of the four central states of the Immortal Alliance came to this conclusion.</p><p></p><p>However, they soon realized they were wrong.</p><p></p><p>"The communication talismans can't be used either!"</p><p></p><p>"We've lost contact with the other states. But we can still contact the Immortal Alliance headquarters."</p><p></p><p>"What did the higher-ups say? Let us act according to the situation? The enemy is already at our doorstep! Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>The four states fell into chaos.</p><p></p><p>Some short-tempered cultivators directly flew to the state border shrouded in silver light.</p><p></p><p>Trying to break through the blockade.</p><p></p><p>The white mist barrier illuminated by the silver light added a sense of sacred solemnity.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators plucked up their courage and charged straight into the white mist.</p><p></p><p>They had already prepared themselves to lose several years of lifespan, but the scene they saw after entering the white mist left them dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The moment they stepped out of the border, the white mist that had filled their vision suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In its place was a boundless starry sky.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they were really outside the Xuanhuang Realm in the void, surrounded by darkness and coldness.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, countless glittering stars could be vaguely seen, flashing from time to time.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were stunned for a moment, wanting to return, but found that the path they had come from was nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it was an illusion, they unleashed sword techniques and spells one after another, but couldn't stir up the slightest ripple in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Attempting to use teleportation and instant movement techniques again, they all failed.</p><p></p><p>Instead, as the spiritual power in the cultivators' bodies was consumed, the surrounding cold starry environment was slowly eroding their minds.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators had no choice but to pick a direction and keep flying.</p><p></p><p>Trying to leave the scope of this starry sky.</p><p></p><p>But what they didn't know was that the sea of stars was boundless. Without the right method, even if they exhausted a lifetime, they would not be able to leave here.</p><p></p><p>Outside the great formation, cultivators kept stepping into the moonlight border.</p><p></p><p>This formation was like an endless abyss, swallowing them all.</p><p></p><p>Nascent Soul, Void Refinement, and even Unity Realm. No matter what cultivation level, once they entered, none returned.</p><p></p><p>After some probing, the cultivators of the four states of the Immortal Alliance were finally awed.</p><p></p><p>Several rainbow lights spanned across the states, arriving at the moonlight border of Tianquan State.</p><p></p><p>One of them was none other than Lu Xichan, the formation grandmaster of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"This formation..." Lu Xichan looked at the moonlight shining on the white mist barrier, shock welling up in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>A young man in white clothes beside her frowned and asked, "When can it be broken? Right now, we've lost contact with all the states outside the great formation."</p><p></p><p>"Not only have the teleportation formations failed, even the Tianxuan Mirror passages have been blocked." There was some worry in the tone of the white-clothed young man.</p><p></p><p>This white-clothed young man was one of the true ruling core Dharma Transmitters of the Immortal Alliance, Dharma Transmitter Ren.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan didn't dare to be negligent and replied, "This formation seems to draw upon the power of the sea of stars, and then uses endless space-time transformations to create what appears to be a real starry sky..."</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Ren coldly interrupted Lu Xichan, "How long until the formation can be broken?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan's voice came to an abrupt halt. After a long time, she said, "The complexity of this formation is something I've only seen once in my life. It should take at least fifteen days..."</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Ren said coldly, "I'll give you ten days."</p><p></p><p>With a cold snort, Dharma Transmitter Ren left in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Leaving only Lu Xichan and several formation masters from the Immortal Alliance's Formation Hall.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan looked up at the starlight grand formation covering the sky above, cold sweat slowly flowing from her forehead.</p><p></p><p>And the higher the attainments in formations among the formation masters present, the more despair there was in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>It absolutely couldn't be said that the formation masters of the Myriad Immortals Alliance were all useless.</p><p></p><p>It was just that the formation the Sacred Emperor had laid this time far surpassed the current era.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had reincarnated for a hundred lifetimes, continuously deriving and accumulating formation knowledge surpassing the Xuanhuang Realm by several generations using the Terminal Dissociation Disk. He then integrated the insights Li Fan, or rather the Dissociation Disk, had gained after obtaining several immortal-grade formations.</p><p></p><p>After being instilled with these essential points of formations, the Sacred Emperor further derived the formations to a deeper level based on his enlightenment in the sea of stars.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the bright moon occupying nearly half the sky above the four states of the Immortal Alliance was the Great Inception of the Sacred Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Countless citizens of the Great Inception were gathered in the Sacred Heart Hall.</p><p></p><p>Kneeling devoutly in prayer before the statue of the Sacred Emperor.</p><p></p><p>And in the Sacred Capital, below the Sacred Emperor's Throne.</p><p></p><p>There were also tens of thousands of second-generation Specter Race people who had been created, chanting the great merits and virtues of the Sacred Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The purple-gold energy of the Sacred Dynasty merged with the essence of golden origin power.</p><p></p><p>This ultimate entrapment formation named the "Bright Moon Starlight Grand Formation" by the Sacred Emperor was almost infinitely close to a true immortal-grade formation. Li Ping believed that even if the Dharma Ancestor personally came, it would take some time to break it.</p><p></p><p>As for those people currently in the four states of the Immortal Alliance trying to break the formation...</p><p></p><p>They still had to ask if he, the Destined Sacred Emperor, agreed or not.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping sat on the Sacred Emperor's Throne, his gaze crossing the boundary between two worlds and falling on the territory of the Myriad Immortals Alliance in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Emperor's Throne, or even the entire Sacred Capital, had become extremely quiet due to the start of the great war.</p><p></p><p>The cat was still the same as always, lazily sleeping on Li Ping's shoulder. It seemed that apart from the essence of origin power, there was nothing in the world that could move its heart.</p><p></p><p>Besides the cat, a figure that looked only about eight or nine years old also stood beside the Sacred Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Staring intently at the Xuanhuang Realm below.</p><p></p><p>It was Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, after receiving the infusion of a large amount of origin power essence and the battle memories of the immortal puppet "Ancestor", his puppet body had undergone earth-shattering changes compared to before. His appearance and body had returned to how they were when he was alive. He had even truly given birth to the breath of life.</p><p></p><p>His strength was unfathomable as he gazed at the Myriad Immortals Alliance, waiting for his opponent to arrive.</p><p></p><p>And below the Sacred Emperor's Throne, Yijue Daoist of the Calamity Transcendence Sect had pulled out all the paper men of the entire sect.</p><p></p><p>The paper men had rebuilt the mountain gate of the Calamity Transcendence Sect from back then on the spot.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the building, a passage seemed to have opened, leading to an unknown destination.</p><p></p><p>Although Yijue Daoist himself had not entered it, his eyes bulged out, extending infinitely outward, probing into the depths of the passage.</p><p></p><p>"Sacred Emperor, please rest assured. If there's any movement in the Xuanhuang Realm, this old Daoist will definitely be able to see it," Yijue Daoist said with a chuckle.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping didn't pay attention to Yijue.</p><p></p><p>In fact, a large part of his attention was on the starry sky outside the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>There, he had already made layers of preparations.</p><p></p><p>Waiting for the Celestial Physician and Dharma Ancestor to descend.</p><p></p><p>Outside the four states of the Immortal Alliance, outside the "Bright Moon Starlight Grand Formation".</p><p></p><p>When the sky of the Xuanhuang Realm became incomparably dim, the Great Inception of the Sacred Dynasty led the subordinate small worlds that were like stars to descend, attracting the attention of all the cultivators of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>At that instant, great changes also occurred simultaneously in the celestial cities of each state of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the bright moon appear in the sky, Sun Luyuan seemed to have a switch pressed in his mind. Without any thought, he directly issued orders to those death warriors who had been prepared for many years.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan, who had been in the Unity Realm for many years and was in charge of a major cultivation family, actually had a moment of blankness in his mind after issuing this order.</p><p></p><p>His throat was dry and his hands and feet were cold.</p><p></p><p>However, before his feeling of lingering fear could well up, he discovered with some surprise that in some states, before his subordinate death warriors could make a move, the Tianxuan Mirrors and teleportation formations had already been destroyed by someone else first.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan understood in his heart: "Such an important matter naturally couldn't be entrusted to me alone."</p><p></p><p>Amidst the chaos, Sun Luyuan saw huge flying ships shining with golden light appear abruptly as if divine soldiers descending from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Before the cultivators of the Immortal Alliance could react, they had already surrounded the celestial cities.</p><p></p><p>Strange-looking puppets flew out from the flying ships, spewing out rays of black light.</p><p></p><p>The defensive formations of the Immortal Alliance's celestial cities, said to be as solid as metal and rock, actually became precarious in an instant.</p><p></p><p>As if they would be cracked at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the rank of the traitors within the Immortal Alliance might be even higher than me."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Grandmaster Lu has also defected?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan narrowed his eyes and observed, instantly feeling much more at ease.</p><p></p><p>"The promising younger generation of the family has already been arranged by me to leave the four states of the Immortal Alliance in advance. As for the rest, I've already notified them to hide in their cave abodes, so they shouldn't be affected."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity about Lu'er, I wasn't able to transfer him out in advance."</p><p></p><p>"Tianci seems to be in seclusion. His strength is even greater than mine, so I shouldn't have to worry about him either."</p><p></p><p>While thinking, Sun Luyuan saw the Immortal Alliance begin to organize cultivators to resist in teams. He couldn't help but snort coldly: "Now, it's time for me to establish merit."</p><p></p><p>Very cautiously, he changed into a different appearance and aura. Sun Luyuan unexpectedly launched an attack on the defensive formations of the Immortal Alliance from the inside. Cooperating with the soldiers of the Sacred Dynasty outside the celestial city, victory in the battle was quickly achieved.</p><p></p><p>As a talisman personally written by the Sacred Emperor was pasted on the forehead of the statue of the Dharma Ancestor in the celestial city.</p><p></p><p>It signified the complete fall of an Immortal Alliance celestial city.</p><p></p><p>The first celestial city conquered by the Sacred Dynasty appeared.</p><p></p><p>Southern Capital State.</p><p></p><p>Although it was because the guardian of this state only had Void Refinement cultivation and the defensive forces were very thin, it was still of great significance.</p><p></p><p>Soon, under the might of the Sacred Emperor and the spread of the Astral Net, all the soldiers of the Sacred Dynasty learned of this matter.</p><p></p><p>So the soldiers of the Sacred Dynasty were greatly encouraged and intensified their offensive again.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Immortals Alliance had been at peace for a long time, and most of the combat power in various places had been transferred to the borders.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with the failure of all the defensive formations they could rely on to counterattack, the Immortal Alliance was almost completely beaten in the face of the fierce attacks of the Sacred Dynasty soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang looked at the map of the Immortal Alliance territory before him, the colors rapidly changing due to the frequent reports of victory, but there was no joy in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Because he knew that the current achievements were only because the Myriad Immortals Alliance had been caught off guard.</p><p></p><p>When they reacted, that would be when the real bitter battle would begin.</p><p></p><p>"A Unity Realm cultivator has appeared in Liuguang State! Blue Ice Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>"A Unity Realm enemy has also appeared in Yueyang State! There is no information about him!

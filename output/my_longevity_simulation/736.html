        <h1>Chapter 736</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"No wonder they say 'no merchant is not crooked', that old thing Jiwang Xian indeed had no good intentions. New 69 Book Bar 69shux.com"</p><p></p><p>After listening to Li Fan's narration, Huo Yuzhu cursed in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Then his expression eased a bit as he looked at Li Fan: "I misjudged you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't take it to heart: "Does the Sect Master have any clues about the matter of me being mysteriously controlled?"</p><p></p><p>After all, he was the leader of one of the Ten Immortal Sects, even if only nominally, his knowledge was still extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Huo Yuzhu pondered for a moment before answering: "I've heard that the entire Ji family, and even the entire merchant guild of the world, were all created by Jiwang Xian for the sake of his cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Although Jiwang Xian himself has not broken through to the Immortal Realm, basically all the cultivators of his generation have already died. Even those who are still alive are all old and decrepit. Who else can maintain their youthful appearance like him?"</p><p></p><p>"This must be related to the cultivation method he practices. Although no one knows the exact cultivation method he uses except himself, it can be almost certain that it is related to bloodline and desire." New 69 Book Bar 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>"It's possible that not only you, but all the Ji family cultivators may be under Jiwang Xian's control." Huo Yuzhu said in a gloomy tone.</p><p></p><p>"Then does the Sect Master know of a way to break the control?" Li Fan frowned and asked.</p><p></p><p>Huo Yuzhu did not immediately answer, but paced back and forth, pondering something.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not hurry him, waiting patiently.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Huo Yuzhu stopped and waved his hand to cast several restrictive spells, sealing the private chamber.</p><p></p><p>He then whispered: "Our Tianjian Sect has a secret technique. By imitating the forging of swords, using the cultivator's spirit, flesh and blood as raw materials, we can forge the [Supreme Sword Body]. If successful, the sword will be the body, and the body will be the sword, reaching the supreme realm of unity between man and sword."</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Sword Body can repel all other foreign energies, so Jiwang Xian's control method will also become ineffective." New 69 Book Bar 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Huo Yuzhu paused: "This method is too dangerous. In the entire history of our Tianjian Sect, the number of successful cultivators can be counted on one hand. Even my senior brother, with his extraordinary talent, failed in the end. And there are still some hidden dangers..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had no hesitation and said directly: "I am willing to give it a try."</p><p></p><p>Huo Yuzhu nodded slightly, with a look of approval: "If you can truly refine the Supreme Sword Body, then handing over the position of Sect Master to you would be no problem."</p><p></p><p>"In the cultivation world, strength is supreme. If I can be like Senior Brother Situo, then being the Sect Master is not a big deal." Li Fan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Huo Yuzhu was suddenly at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>In the private chamber, after further detailed discussions, they finally reached a consensus.</p><p></p><p>Next, Li Fan would continue to make a big show, attracting the attention of the entire sect.</p><p></p><p>While Huo Yuzhu would secretly go to the Wuxing Sect.</p><p></p><p>As the Sect Master of the Tianjian Sect, he must have his own supporters. Just like in real history, convincing the Wuxing Sect Master to sell the [Taiyuan Refined Gold] should not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he already knew in advance that there might be a spy from the Merchant Guild within the Wuxing Sect, so this time Huo Yuzhu would definitely be more careful and not leak any information.</p><p></p><p>Just as expected, seven days later, Huo Yuzhu returned safely.</p><p></p><p>He did not communicate anything with Li Fan, only signaling with his eyes that everything was understood without words.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, with a sufficient supply of [Taiyuan Refined Gold], the forging of the Rift Sovereign Sword progressed several times faster than expected. Li Fan no longer needed to extract sword dao insights from the wooden sword left by the Self-Proclaimed Master, and then infuse them into the sword embryo.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan felt that the duration of this Sinking Immortal Realm was about to end, the Rift Sovereign Sword forged with the full strength of the sect was finally completed.</p><p></p><p>The Ji family also seemed to have learned of this in advance through some means, and sent a group of cultivators led by Ji Shiwen to "congratulate" them.</p><p></p><p>In reality, they were here to reap the rewards.</p><p></p><p>The huge Rift Sovereign Sword stood tall, its exterior appearing like ordinary gray stone, seemingly unremarkable.</p><p></p><p>But day and night...</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who was meditating by the [Sword], could vaguely feel the terrifying power within it.</p><p></p><p>Situo Yao gathered the members of the Heavenly Sword Sect at the back mountain.</p><p></p><p>"The divine weapon has been forged, and everyone has made invaluable contributions."</p><p></p><p>"I, Situo Yao, will keep my promise. The one who has contributed the most [Primal Essence Gold] will become the sect master of the Heavenly Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ji Shiwen's face lit up with joy.</p><p></p><p>But the following words from Situo Yao shattered his excitement.</p><p></p><p>"According to the calculation of the Elder Council, Huo Yuzhu has contributed a total of 86,912 jin of [Primal Essence Gold], the most among all."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, the next sect master of the Heavenly Sword Sect will still be him."</p><p></p><p>The venue fell into complete silence.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible! How can someone have more than us, the Ji family?" Ji Shiwen's angry voice broke the silence.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Are you questioning me?" Situo Yao narrowed his eyes and looked at Ji Shiwen.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shiwen's words were stuck in his throat.</p><p></p><p>"Well, let's just say you have lost fair and square. The Ji family has contributed a total of 86,911 jin of [Primal Essence Gold], just one jin short..." Situo Yao shook his head slightly, with a rather regretful expression.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shiwen's eyes were about to pop out, and he pointed at Situo Yao, trembling with anger.</p><p></p><p>"This is too much! Too much! Aren't you afraid of being ridiculed by the world for what the Heavenly Sword Sect has done?"</p><p></p><p>Situo Yao's expression turned cold: "Young Ji, since you have contributed so much Primal Essence Gold, I won't hold a grudge against your previous words. But if you dare to spout nonsense again..."</p><p></p><p>He snorted coldly, and Ji Shiwen shivered, only able to swallow back the words in his stomach.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something and looked sharply at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan also had an unbelievable and dazed expression, momentarily becoming somewhat confused.</p><p></p><p>After seeing the guests off, the Heavenly Sword Sect officially began to move into the Rift Divine Weapon.</p><p></p><p>Everything that could be taken away was taken.</p><p></p><p>Even the spiritual fields outside the sect were dug three feet deep and moved as a whole.</p><p></p><p>The Rift Divine Weapon claimed to be a separate world.</p><p></p><p>So there was no need to worry about not having enough space.</p><p></p><p>Only the wooden sword left by the White Elder, as well as the countless flying swords left in the sword tomb by the previous seniors of the Heavenly Sword Sect, were not allowed to be touched on Situo Yao's orders.</p><p></p><p>In his words, the sword intent was too strong and might conflict with the Rift Divine Weapon.</p><p></p><p>As for the specific reason, only he knew.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the day of departure to the Rift came.</p><p></p><p>The disciples turned into streams of sword light and flew into the divine weapon in batches.</p><p></p><p>But Situo Yao looked at the rapidly approaching aura and revealed a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>"I won't bother you all to see us off. The mess in the Xuanhuang Realm, you can clean it up yourselves. We of the Heavenly Sword Sect really don't have that ability."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I forgot to tell you one thing. That little brat Ji Wangxian is not honest. He has planted quite a few thorns in our Immortal Dao Sect."</p><p></p><p>Situo Yao looked at the distant figure rapidly approaching and said.</p><p></p><p>"Jiao Xuan!" Ji Wangxian's voice came from afar.</p><p></p><p>With his words, Li Fan, as if out of control, suddenly rushed towards Situo Yao, with a strange and dazzling aura surging from his body.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was about to reach Situo Yao, he suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>He turned his head and gave Ji Wangxian a mocking smile.</p><p></p><p>Ji Wangxian immediately understood everything, and his expression became increasingly angry.</p><p></p><p>However, Situo Yao quickly grabbed Li Fan and retreated into the Rift Divine Weapon.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ji, thank you for giving us such a good seedling for the Heavenly Sword Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Wangxian's face was as dark as water, and he stretched out his left hand, and in an instant, countless copper coins seemed to have gathered on it.</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, a blazing light burst out from the Rift Divine Weapon.</p><p></p><p>The copper coin illusion immediately dissipated.</p><p></p><p>He could only watch helplessly as a sword light tore through the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>That destructive power, which seemed to be able to cut through space and time, forced him to retreat thousands of miles away to avoid the sharp edge.</p><p></p><p>When the light faded, the Heavenly Sword Sect and the Rift Divine Weapon had disappeared from his sight.</p>

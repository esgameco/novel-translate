            <p>Chapter 1087: The Celestial Realm's Proclamation</p><p></p><p>A rift tore across the sky of the Xuanhuang Realm, countless sacred golden rays shooting out from within, dyeing the entire world with a golden hue.</p><p></p><p>Auspicious clouds filled the heavens, a somewhat blurry figure rising from the earth and slowly flying towards the rift.</p><p></p><p>The figure's silhouette emitted a dazzling seven-colored radiance.</p><p></p><p>As it ascended into the rift, a hazy rain also descended from within, nurturing all living things drop by drop.</p><p></p><p>Almost instantaneously, the entire Xuanhuang Realm underwent changes that were nearly visible to the naked eye under the nourishment of the divine rain.</p><p></p><p>The world became more vibrant and full of vitality.</p><p></p><p>The creatures on earth, irrigated by the divine rain, became wiser and more talented.</p><p></p><p>The joyous consciousness of countless groups permeated the world.</p><p></p><p>Even the world itself felt the same!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"Ascension?"</p><p></p><p>An ancient term that cultivators would never forget suddenly appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>The era when the path to immortality had not been severed was far too long ago.</p><p></p><p>One could only catch a glimpse of the prosperity of the ancient cultivation world between the lines of old classics.</p><p></p><p>Yet now, Li Fan had the fortune to witness with his own eyes a Xuanhuang Realm cultivator's ascension!</p><p></p><p>His mind trembled, deeply captivated.</p><p></p><p>"So it turns out that when a cultivator ascends, it brings unimaginable benefits to the entire world."</p><p></p><p>"The more cultivators ascend, the stronger the foundation of their cultivation realm becomes."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that quite a few cultivators from the Xuanhuang Realm have ascended in the past. No wonder..."</p><p></p><p>The anomaly of the cultivator's ascension lasted for the time it took to drink a cup of tea.</p><p></p><p>The rift in the sky slowly closed, the golden light gradually disappearing.</p><p></p><p>At the last moment, a scroll floated down from it.</p><p></p><p>Unfurling in the wind, it appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang Realm... A mortal cultivated for 865 years, his merit participating in the ways of nature, attaining the Dao and ascending."</p><p></p><p>"This celestial proclamation is hereby issued to celebrate this event."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The writing on the scroll was blurry and unclear, especially the name of the ascended one, which was already missing.</p><p></p><p>But it roughly outlined the past life of this cultivator who had ascended to immortality, as well as the celestial realm's encouragement to the cultivators of the lower Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This scroll, is it the [Celestial Proclamation Scroll] passed down from the celestial realm back then?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared intently at the seemingly ordinary scroll, his heart surging.</p><p></p><p>"However, the form of this celestial proclamation scroll seems a bit familiar?"</p><p></p><p>"It's almost the same as the phenomenon that occurs when a cultivator perishes nowadays. It turns out it wasn't the Dao of Heaven's whim, but had an early prototype..."</p><p></p><p>"Except one is the upper realm's commendation, while the other is the Xuanhuang Dao of Heaven mocking cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"However, judging from the wording of this celestial proclamation, the celestial realm is extremely welcoming and even encouraging of cultivators ascending."</p><p></p><p>"The divine rain that descends during ascension may be a kind of reward."</p><p></p><p>"But at some point, something unknown happened in the celestial realm. Not only was the path to immortality severed, but even true immortals had to flee and scatter..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but narrow his eyes.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he finally collected his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He looked again at the celestial proclamation scroll before him.</p><p></p><p>"To take it or not?"</p><p></p><p>A difficult question was suddenly placed before him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>In front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you fail, you can start over in the next life."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can personally take a look at the Immortal Scroll Edict, this trip will not be in vain."</p><p></p><p>Without hesitating for long, Li Fan reached out his hand, using infinite divine power to instantly break the prohibition covering the two treasures.</p><p></p><p>However, when he wanted to take possession of them, there was a bit of trouble.</p><p></p><p>The Desolate God Token and the Immortal Scroll Edict were both items from the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Not mortal objects that could be easily taken.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's current strength as the Mysterious Yellow Celestial Venerate, if he only took one of them, he could do so quite smoothly without alarming the cultivators of the Tiansu Sect.</p><p></p><p>The first to notice the abnormality was the third party in the secret treasury, that wooden box.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have sensed that the two neighbors who had accompanied it for a long time had actually broken free, and the unknown existence sealed in the wooden box suddenly became restless.</p><p></p><p>Emitting a rapid and faint sound.</p><p></p><p>Countless illusions came one after another, constantly appearing before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's action of taking the two treasures couldn't help but pause slightly.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you, brat!"</p><p></p><p>An angry shout followed, resounding like a thunderclap.</p><p></p><p>Then, five powerful Longevity Realm auras suddenly appeared, locking onto Li Fan from afar and rushing towards the secret treasury.</p><p></p><p>"This is a bit troublesome."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt a little helpless in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, after a moment, he still completed the retrieval of the scroll and the Desolate God Seal.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the five Longevity Realm cultivators who had already rushed into the Tiansu Courtyard, he shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Then, under the eyes of everyone, his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>After several consecutive teleportations, from the Tiansu Sect all the way to the southwestern border of the Mysterious Yellow Realm, he finally got rid of the pursuit of the five Longevity cultivators from the Tiansu Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that Li Fan was not a match for these Longevity cultivators, but fighting with them had no meaning at all.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the two treasures he had plundered.</p><p></p><p>Putting the Desolate God Seal aside for the moment, Li Fan slowly unfolded the Immortal Scroll Edict.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity..."</p><p></p><p>After seeing the contents of the scroll clearly, Li Fan sighed.</p><p></p><p>As it turned out, this scroll was exactly the same as the memories of the Mysterious Yellow Realm's Dao!</p><p></p><p>Incomplete and unclear!</p><p></p><p>"It exceeds the limit of what the Mysterious Yellow Celestial Venerate can trace back to."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, this Desolate God Seal is also just an empty shell, unable to truly manifest the power of an immortal artifact."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt utterly disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, being able to learn so much information about immortal artifacts at once is already quite remarkable."</p><p></p><p>"The Tiansu Sect's treasury being robbed is such an embarrassing matter, they naturally won't actively publicize it and will only investigate privately. It will probably take some time for the other sects of the Ten Immortal Dao Sects to learn about this matter. I have to hurry."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's figure flashed, arriving at the next hiding place of an immortal artifact.</p><p></p><p>This time, having learned from the previous lesson, Li Fan did not dwell on the other treasures in the treasury.</p><p></p><p>He only fought swiftly and decisively, stealing the immortal artifacts one by one.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it only took three days to successfully collect all the immortal artifacts in the memories of the Mysterious Yellow Dao.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that there was not the slightest difficulty. As long as one was a normal cultivator, after possessing Mr. Bai, it could be easily done.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, then what exactly is being tested in this trial to become the Mysterious Yellow Great Celestial Venerate?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the thirteen immortal artifacts of various shapes in front of him, Li Fan couldn't help but fall into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, urged by the Dao of the Mysterious Yellow Realm in his mind, Li Fan also received the next stage of the "main storyline quest".</p><p></p><p>"The power of the Mysterious Yellow, detonating the immortal artifacts. Immortal power imbued in the body, leaping over the immortal wall, henceforth carefree..."</p><p></p><p>Feeling the anticipation and joy in his heart, Li Fan's breathing also couldn't help but become a few parts more rapid.</p>

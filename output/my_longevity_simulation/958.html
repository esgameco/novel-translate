            <p>"By the way, maybe we can extract some useful information from Tian Yi during the confrontation. New 69 Book Bar â†’ 69shux.com"</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Li Fan split off another thread of his consciousness and entered the blue sphere.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps influenced by Li Fan's earlier provocation, the speed of the black light swirling on Hanhai's blue and white orb had increased several times compared to before.</p><p></p><p>It was like a fierce storm had been stirred up, causing the blue and white orb to become somewhat chaotic.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the frequency and intensity of the shockwaves released by Hanhai were constantly increasing.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that it is indeed due to years of suffering from nightmares and the desire for revenge that has led to such emotional instability."</p><p></p><p>Like a compassionate doctor who heals the world, Li Fan began to ponder how to solve Hanhai's condition.</p><p></p><p>The way of medicine, whether great or small, is similar.</p><p></p><p>Throughout history, people like Hanhai who are unable to extricate themselves from past hatred are not uncommon.</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long for Li Fan to find a countermeasure.</p><p></p><p>When there was a lull in the erupting shockwaves, Li Fan's thread of consciousness once again charged into the black storm on the orb.</p><p></p><p>It was still the endlessly repeating nightmare scene.</p><p></p><p>However, perhaps due to Hanhai's extreme emotional instability, the scenes Li Fan saw from a first-person perspective were all covered with a black and yellow filter.</p><p></p><p>And they were always in a state of constant shaking.</p><p></p><p>This made the already terrifying slaughter scenes appear even more sinister and horrifying.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan lurked in the shadows, quietly waiting for the "plot" to unfold. New 69 Book Bar 85shux.com</p><p></p><p>Soon, it reached the point where Hanhai "saw through" the true identity of the murderer.</p><p></p><p>Hanhai's body trembled slightly, with an expression of disbelief on his face: "Tian Yi? You are Tian Yi!?"</p><p></p><p>The murderer also cooperated very well, revealing a strange smile: "Hehehe, that's right. I am Tian Yi!"</p><p></p><p>Upon getting the answer, Hanhai's whole body bulged with blue veins, his eyes wide open in anger.</p><p></p><p>Just as his mind was about to be devoured by rage...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an extremely cold voice suddenly rang out in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Ethereal and uncertain, yet like a torrential downpour, it instantly extinguished Hanhai's endless anger: "Don't be fooled by the other party!"</p><p></p><p>"Take a closer look, who exactly is he?!"</p><p></p><p>"This person has lost all conscience and is extremely cruel. How could such an evil person easily admit his true identity?"</p><p></p><p>"Wake up! The heavy responsibility of revenge rests solely on your shoulders! There can be no slightest mistake!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the constant whispers, Hanhai couldn't help but shudder.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, that's right..."</p><p></p><p>"How could he admit it as soon as I asked?"</p><p></p><p>"There must be something strange about this..."</p><p></p><p>Hanhai muttered to himself and looked at the murderer in front of him again.</p><p></p><p>What shocked his heart was that, due to his suspicion, the other party's appearance and aura had indeed changed again. New 69 Book Bar 85shux.com</p><p></p><p>No longer in the form of Tian Yi, but turned into the solemn and old-fashioned Tian Yu Venerable!</p><p></p><p>"No, how could Tian Yu Venerable possibly do such a thing?!"</p><p></p><p>Hanhai shook his head frantically, as if trying to throw this terrible thought out of his mind.</p><p></p><p>And as his doubts grew, the murderer's appearance kept changing.</p><p></p><p>"Tian You Venerable? Tian Yin Venerable? Tian Yi..."</p><p></p><p>The only thing that remained constant was the murderer's aura representing the authority of the Heavenly Law Realm.</p><p></p><p>The enemy was within reach, yet he had no ability to take revenge.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>This was already an extremely miserable situation.</p><p></p><p>However, what was even more miserable was that the true identity of the enemy was unclear.</p><p></p><p>There was no specific target to seek revenge on, even if one wanted to.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding scenery shook more and more violently, and cracks appeared in the black and yellow filter.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Hanhai could no longer endure this torture.</p><p></p><p>The scene shattered with a bang.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming energy that erupted buried everything in this nightmare.</p><p></p><p>"It worked!" </p><p></p><p>That thread of Li Fan's consciousness thought so before disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Outside Hanhai's residence, beyond the blue light sphere.</p><p></p><p>As Hanhai's spirit temporarily collapsed, the shockwaves that were occasionally sent out to destroy the seal's prohibition finally ceased.</p><p></p><p>"The unforgettable hatred has now turned into a confusion of not knowing who the enemy is. I suppose Hanhai should be able to temporarily settle down for a while."</p><p></p><p>"But as time goes by, I'm sure he will still find a new target for revenge."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... I estimate it will still be [Heavenly Doctor]."</p><p></p><p>In the thousands of years, it was obvious that the Heavenly Doctor had treated Hanhai more than once. Otherwise, based on the degree of nightmare torture he experienced, it would be impossible for him to still maintain a considerable degree of clarity.</p><p></p><p>But each time, it ultimately returned to the result of identifying the Heavenly Doctor as the culprit...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment and determined the reason for this phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Li Fan could understand Hanhai's perception to some extent.</p><p></p><p>This was because the Heavenly Doctor's methods of treating illnesses recorded in the "Patching the Heavens" and "Heavenly Doctor's Scriptures" were really at odds with the values of normal people.</p><p></p><p>It was much more exaggerated than "fighting poison with poison".</p><p></p><p>Everything was for the ultimate goal of curing the disease and achieving the objective, regardless of what means were used in the process...</p><p></p><p>It was not within the Heavenly Doctor's scope of consideration.</p><p></p><p>Just taking Li Fan's "treatment" of Hanhai this time, the treatment process could almost be summarized with the two words "deception".</p><p></p><p>Although Hanhai would no longer feel the suffering brought about by hatred, he would always be immersed in endless confusion.</p><p></p><p>Cured, yet not completely cured.</p><p></p><p>But at the very least, the "symptom" that Li Fan initially targeted and needed to treat was indeed resolved.</p><p></p><p>This was the way of the Heavenly Doctor, the consistent content throughout.</p><p></p><p>It might conflict with the values of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>But when Li Fan used it, there was no psychological barrier.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Doctor..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed slightly as he slowly gathered his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that his treatment was effective and that Hanhai would not impact the seal in the short term.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan begin the work of repairing the prohibition.</p><p></p><p>The prohibition of [Hidden World Empty Space] was extremely complex.</p><p></p><p>As for the way of prohibition, Li Fan had only dabbled in it in his previous reincarnations.</p><p></p><p>However, when one method was mastered, all methods could be mastered. Arrays and prohibitions had many similarities.</p><p></p><p>What the Heavenly Doctor imparted was also extremely detailed.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the entire process, there were no oversights.</p><p></p><p>Half a month passed, and the loosened seal was finally reinforced.</p><p></p><p>The Yunshui Heavenly Palace once again fell into absolute dead silence.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps for them, falling into eternal slumber is the best ending."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed in his heart, gently placing a pot of wine at the feet of Qin Tang's stone statue.</p><p></p><p>Then his figure flew away, quietly leaving this place.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Yunshui Heavenly Palace, the anomaly that had previously appeared in the sky had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Restoring the usual tranquility.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Li Fan couldn't think of a way to contact the Heavenly Doctor.</p>

            <p>Chapter 1145: Transmitting the Old Dharma</p><p></p><p>"Can you tell me his story?" </p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren collapsed to the ground, asking in a dazed manner.</p><p></p><p>Breaking the long-lasting silence.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, Yin Shangren, still holding a glimmer of hope, conducted the final test and verification in the underground prison of the Holy Capital.</p><p></p><p>The result was exactly as Li Ping had said.</p><p></p><p>So he said nothing more, only carefully collecting Mr. Bai's rib.</p><p></p><p>Then he returned to the Holy Emperor's seat, staring blankly in front of Mr. Bai's image.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping did not disturb him either, also staring intently at the portrait.</p><p></p><p>As if also reminiscing.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yin Shangren's question was just what Li Ping wanted.</p><p></p><p>He immediately recounted Mr. Bai's general life experience.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren listened with great fascination.</p><p></p><p>"I only knew that in the ancient Xuanhuang Realm, there existed Great Celestial Venerables who surpassed all Eternal Life Realm experts. But I never thought..."</p><p></p><p>"Such a figure would actually sacrifice himself for mortals."</p><p></p><p>There was confusion and incomprehension on Yin Shangren's face.</p><p></p><p>"The deceased is gone. What we can do is to fulfill Mr. Bai's last wish and mourn his spirit in heaven."</p><p></p><p>"The reason I founded this [Holy Dynasty Enlightenment] is also for these mortals. Sir, observe the lives of mortals within our dynasty's territory, how do they compare to the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren turned his head, his gaze seeming to instantly sweep across various places in the Great Enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he nodded slightly and sighed in admiration, "Compared to the situation in the Xuanhuang Realm, where mortals are like domesticated cattle and horses, yours can be considered an ideal prosperous world for mortals."</p><p></p><p>"My vision is to promote this system to the small worlds of Xuanhuang, and even to the Xuanhuang Realm itself!" Li Ping said proudly.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren looked at Li Ping, sighed, but did not refute.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping smiled slightly, "Sir, don't be discouraged, please listen to my words first."</p><p></p><p>"The strength of Xuanhuang lies in the transmission of dharma. The invincibility of dharma transmission lies in new dharma. If we can use the dharma transmitted by Mr. Bai to destroy the foundation of dharma transmission..."</p><p></p><p>"Once the dharma transmission is resolved, the others in the Myriad Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Council are all like clay chickens and tile dogs."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren stared blankly at Li Ping, not knowing why this cultivator, whose aura was only at the Hua Shen realm, spoke with such grandiosity. </p><p></p><p>And more crucially, Yin Shangren also felt a strong self-confidence from the other party.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that it's not just boasting? Could it be that this person is hiding his true strength?" Yin Shangren examined Li Ping carefully again.</p><p></p><p>"To destroy the foundation of dharma transmission, I believe there is no one in the world more suitable than you, sir." Li Ping did not avoid Yin Shangren's scrutinizing gaze and said solemnly once again.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren was a little hesitant, "With my talent alone, I'm afraid..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's eyes were full of sincerity, "If not in ten years, then a hundred years. If not in a hundred years, then a thousand years! We have waited so long and finally waited for such a glimmer of hope. How could we easily give up?"</p><p></p><p>"Surely you don't want to let Mr. Bai down either, right?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren trembled slightly and subconsciously clenched his fists.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, just focus on researching the new dharma. Leave all other issues to me."</p><p></p><p>After this conversation, Yin Shangren finally made up his mind to stay here and study the dharma of "Establishing Foundation with Self" after his own foundation establishment.</p><p></p><p>In any case, for him, there was no limit to his lifespan. If he didn't find something he was willing to do, he would probably completely lose his self-consciousness before long and assimilate with those world wraiths.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining Yin Shangren's promise, Li Ping was overjoyed. </p><p></p><p>He immediately brought him to a secret space under the Holy Capital.</p><p></p><p>It turned out to be a large area of dedicated research facilities already prepared for Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>"I have a plan. Sir, see if it is feasible."</p><p></p><p>"Select a large group of extremely talented and ignorant youths, teach them this [Dharma of Establishing Foundation with Self], and then..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan detailed the method he had used before.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, his expression became somewhat solemn: "Perhaps it's feasible. However, the specifics still need to be practically verified."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan waved his hand: "The thoughts and ideas of children are like wild fantasies. Even if they can't really stumble upon a path, as long as it can give you a bit of inspiration, that's enough."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren was obviously not a pedantic person and nodded in agreement with Li Fan's plan.</p><p></p><p>He had little sympathy for the predestined miserable lives of these chosen children.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, there's still one thing that has been bothering me. I want to accomplish it, but I can never find a way..." Li Ping paused, seeming a bit hesitant.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren glanced at Li Ping, indicating for him to continue.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai's bones are scattered throughout the Xuanhuang Realm. I want to gather them and bury them properly. The others are easy to deal with, basically all privately collected by cultivators. The only thing is..."</p><p></p><p>"His skull is collected by the Wanxian Alliance and stored in the Museum of Divine Treasures at their headquarters."</p><p></p><p>A hint of resentment flashed in Li Ping's eyes as he said hatefully, "Those insect-like members of the Wanxian Alliance point at it disrespectfully during their visits. Every time I think of this, I can't help but want to rush in regardless of everything to snatch the skull back."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I tried once. There's absolutely no possibility of success. Inside the Museum of Divine Treasures, there seems to be a mysterious powerhouse hidden. Even placing Mr. Bai's skull in the very center of the museum was his idea. It's clearly a trap to lure people like me who attach great importance to Mr. Bai..."</p><p></p><p>"You've entered the Wanxian Alliance headquarters before?" Yin Shangren was startled upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>After Li Ping described in detail all the scenes and details after entering, the look in Yin Shangren's eyes towards Li Ping had subtle differences.</p><p></p><p>"It's indeed a bit difficult." Li Ping sighed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Yin Shangren finally said, "Fellow Daoist, there's no need to be discouraged. Actually, back then, I also had this idea. However, after figuring out the identity of the museum curator, I gave up."</p><p></p><p>"This person is one of the three Demon Beast Emperors from the ancient Demon Beast Clan, existing since the remote ancient times. Even the Dharma Heavenly Venerable was polite to him back then..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping frowned slightly, "He has such power? Back then, when Mr. Bai killed those demon beasts, it was like slaughtering chickens and dogs."</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma Venerable should be even more powerful than Mr. Bai. With the Dharma Venerable's strength and status, why would he need to be polite to some emperor?"</p><p></p><p>There was full doubt in his tone, and Li Ping obviously didn't believe Yin Shangren's words.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren shook his head slightly, "Anyway, I can be certain that when the Dharma Venerable met that person back then, it was indeed like that. Completely different from his attitude towards others."</p><p></p><p>"Either his strength was recognized by the Dharma Venerable, or..."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren paused, "They had already known each other."</p><p></p><p>"But that should have been their first meeting." Yin Shangren lowered his voice, obviously a bit puzzled himself.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping knew that Yin Shangren was a remnant soul from an old world devoured by the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Possessing fragmented memories of the bygone realm, so what he saw shouldn't be false.</p><p></p><p>"Emperor Mao was originally an elder of the Beast Taming Sect, belonging to a lineage of the Ten Immortal Sects. After the Ten Sects came into conflict with the Dharma Venerable, he actually chose to stand on the Dharma Venerable's side. Moreover, thousands of years later, he transformed and became the curator of the Museum of Divine Treasures, one of the three highest ruling powers of the Immortal Alliance, the 'Illusory Truth Sage'..."</p><p></p><p>"Old acquaintances?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping suddenly thought of a question.</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Law Realm, are there actually demon beasts?</p><p></p><p>The demon beasts of Xuanhuang all evolved from Emperor Yi.</p><p></p><p>Then what about the Heavenly Law Realm?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>In the Yanfa Jue space at the Immortal Alliance headquarters, a hint of imperceptible light flashed in the eyes of Li Fan's true body.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, I need to make another trip to the Fallen Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>That's all for today, there will be another chapter updated tomorrow during the day. My heart is pounding heavily, going to sleep early.</p>

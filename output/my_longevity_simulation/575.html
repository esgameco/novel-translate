        <h1>Chapter 575</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>He Zhenghao looked at the island he had guarded for decades in front of him, then looked at his successor standing on the side nodding and bowing, feeling a surge of pride in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Once upon a time, like this successor, he would feel anxious and uneasy when there were superiors coming to inspect.</p><p></p><p>Afraid of being blamed by the leaders.</p><p></p><p>But now, in just a few years, he, He Zhenghao, had become the type of "big shot" that he used to look up to.</p><p></p><p>After encouraging the junior on the side named Zhao Changli, He Zhenghao skillfully entered the 【Mountain River Star Formation】.</p><p></p><p>The mountains hung over their heads, blocking possible prying eyes from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators invited by He Zhenghao had been waiting here for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Friend He!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as He Zhenghao made his appearance, they warmly greeted him. In their eyes, if Li Fan was the god of wealth, then He Zhenghao was the typical spender.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging pleasantries, a cultivator couldn't wait to ask, "Friend He, the secret envoys have predicted that the war is about to end? There are no signs of that at all. Today I even heard that the Immortal Alliance declared they wanted to fight to the end..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, he was interrupted by everyone talking at once.</p><p></p><p>"The secret envoys' predictions are never wrong. If you don't believe it, why bother coming here today?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, friend He, ignore him. Let's talk about the unlimited fundraising plan that is not capped this time."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao raised his hands ceremoniously, bringing instant silence to the scene.</p><p></p><p>With a smile on his face, he began to explain the details to the crowd.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators, getting confirmation from He Zhenghao's own mouth, were extremely thrilled.</p><p></p><p>But because the scale of this fundraising was too large, He Zhenghao alone couldn't handle it. Some cultivators still had doubts in their minds.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Li Fan showed up.</p><p></p><p>A silver light descended from the sky between the mountains.</p><p></p><p>Dressed in white Daoist robes, stepping on starlight, appearing neither fast nor slow but arriving in an instant, he entered the scene.</p><p></p><p>A rhythmic wave emanated from Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>Instantly capturing the attention of all cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>Since they were invited by He Zhenghao, they were all wealthy and well-traveled individuals.</p><p></p><p>But facing the aura still lingering on Li Fan's body, they were all deeply shocked.</p><p></p><p>As if facing the profound and boundless Tao, just a slight touch brought various insights to their minds involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>One cultivator even showed ecstasy and began to meditate, disregarding the occasion.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of power is this? Even if he is a godlike figure, it doesn't compare, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Lord of Secrets has restored his original realm?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone exchanged glances, unable to hide their astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"I have been in seclusion for a long time, and with some insignificant gains, I am still unable to adapt and fully restrain myself."</p><p></p><p>"My apologies for any misunderstanding," Li Fan said casually.</p><p></p><p>The crowd was shaken, their thoughts racing, and no one dared to interrupt.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Li Fan continued, "During this seclusion, as my cultivation advanced further, I also took the opportunity to repair our sect's treasure, the 【Heaven and Earth Ruler's Die】."</p><p></p><p>"This item was damaged during my trial at the Martial Hall. Even though repairing it was effortless, I had a premonition that the time was not right, so I refrained from it."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan spoke, a crystal clear twenty-sided die appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>It kept spinning, and within the sparkling faces of the die, countless fast-paced images could be vaguely seen.</p><p></p><p>"Recently, my cultivation has made progress. With good fortune accompanying me, I knew it was time to fully restore it."</p><p></p><p>"In this process, I caught a glimpse of a possible future."</p><p></p><p>The crowd's hearts skipped a beat as they listened attentively.</p><p></p><p>"The two godlike beings, Hongxi and Ziyun, will soon return to the Cloud City. As you all know, although I am currently in charge of the political affairs of the Cloud Sea, it is only temporary in their absence."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face did not show any emotion, as if he was discussing something unrelated to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Once they return, it is only right and just that I hand back the power to them."</p><p></p><p>"I am an ancient cultivator, accustomed to freedom and casualness, unwilling to be controlled by others. Perhaps from now on, after resigning from the position of the Lord of Secrets, I will leave the Cloud Sea and go explore the territory of the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"I have a karmic connection with you all by governing and rebuilding the Cloud City successfully. It would not have been possible without your support."</p><p></p><p>"So, before I step down, I will assist you all once more."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze swept over everyone. "After this, our fate will come to an end, and there may be no more involvement between us."</p><p></p><p>With these words, a commotion broke out in the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was not ignorant. Although Li Fan stated that he didn't want power and intended to retreat, many were quick to realize.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, so he's trying to seize power for himself and seek our support!"</p><p></p><p>"It's understandable. He is the highest ruler of a whole province. It's not easy to let go of power that easily."</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators in attendance suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to how loyal supporters of Li Fan, such as He Zhenghao and Gao Yuan, were rewarded with key positions after his victory, they felt that an opportunity had come.</p><p></p><p>"The Lord of Secrets need not worry. We will certainly support you wholeheartedly!"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, even though Hongxi and Ziyun have a good reputation, when they were in power, they were often aloof. How could they lead fellow cultivators to prosperity like the Lord of Secrets?"</p><p></p><p>"I must confess, I have been fortunate to participate in the Lord of Secrets' fundraising plans each time. Along with my own efforts, in just a few years, my wealth has increased more than six times compared to the initial amount!"</p><p></p><p>"I might have been a bit slow to catch on, but I have also doubled my wealth!"</p><p></p><p>"Support the Lord of Secrets!"</p><p></p><p>"Following the Lord, we will prosper and enlighten the Tao!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As soon as one person took the lead, it immediately sparked a response from the cultivating crowd. They all expressed their support for Li Fan eagerly and in unison.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze imperceptibly swept over He Zhenghao, who responded quickly and took out the prepared 【Agreement Document】 and the list from his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>The fundraising was conducted on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Despite some cultivators not originally willing, under the enthusiastic atmosphere and the watchful eyes of Li Fan, they had to dig into their savings a bit.</p><p></p><p>"To boost momentum, when I appeared, I used a piece of 【Human Star Dust】 and some Enlightenment Pills."</p><p></p><p>"But I won't take these back from you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself.</p>

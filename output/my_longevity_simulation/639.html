        <h1>Chapter 639</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>It was the wild speed that Li Fan had never experienced since he began practicing and refining his heart mantra. </p><p></p><p>It seemed like some special switch had been triggered, as the efficiency of the mysterious Huang Refining Heart Mantra had increased by more than a thousand times compared to before. </p><p></p><p>If Li Fan's previous attempts were like a slow grindstone being dragged by a donkey, then now, the mysterious Huang Refining Heart Mantra was like a roaring giant machine, absorbing all the sudden and countless real and illusory experiences in Li Fan's mind. </p><p></p><p>Sorting out the chaos, returning to the source! </p><p></p><p>Just like a bucket of cold water pouring down on his head, completely cooling down the burning sensations. </p><p></p><p>Gradually, Li Fan began to recover from his daze and bewilderment. </p><p></p><p>"This..." </p><p></p><p>"?" </p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan understood what had just happened to him, feeling shocked in his heart. He had not expected that the backlash of the complete "chaos" mantra would be so terrifying. Once it formed, its strength far surpassed his previous incomplete "practice." </p><p></p><p>Once chaos was formed, it seemed to undergo a qualitative change, its power incomparable to mere half-hearted attempts.</p><p></p><p>"Even the backlash is so terrifying, then what about its actual effects..." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan, suppressing the turmoil in his body and mind, looked towards the sky. </p><p></p><p>He saw a distortion in the scene where rain and bodies were falling, as if there were an invisible void, causing rain and bodies to disappear instantly when they approached. </p><p></p><p>But after absorbing the bizarre rainwater, the range of the distorted void seemed to gradually shrink. </p><p></p><p>Thus, the two seemed to be in a state of mutual balance, constantly cancelling out each other. </p><p></p><p>In the end, when no more raindrops fell from the sky, the effects of the chaos mantra also disappeared. </p><p></p><p>A disheveled figure fell from the sky. It was Yin Shangren. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, his body appeared translucent, with an expression of disbelief as he gazed blankly at Li Fan. </p><p></p><p>He wanted to say something, opened his mouth, but no sound came out. </p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren looked down at himself, as if he understood something, and stopped trying in vain. </p><p></p><p>As his body became increasingly translucent, there was no fear of impending doom on his face, but rather a sense of relief and liberation. </p><p></p><p>After a moment, Yin Shangren completely disappeared from this world. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan, despite escaping danger, couldn't afford to celebrate. Driven by a growing sense of crisis, he endured his injuries and quickly activated the One-Handed Heaven Covering Secret Technique, using his escape technique to leave the place. </p><p></p><p>Shortly after Li Fan left, a huge and incomparable divine thought descended. </p><p></p><p>The underwater scene nearby seemed to rewind like a time reversal, constantly replaying the past. But just when Li Fan's figure was about to appear, cracks appeared out of thin air, followed by countless more rifts, disrupting the scene. </p><p></p><p>The reversed images shattered like mirrors, restored to normal. </p><p></p><p>The divine thought lingered for a while, as if contemplating something, then quietly swept over the entire misty sea before ultimately finding nothing abnormal and falling silent. </p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Li Fan, who had not yet returned to the Mist Cloud City, dug out a mineral from the seabed, pretending to be excited as he stored it in his storage ring. </p><p></p><p>After pretending to mine for a while, he stopped once the sense of impending crisis had subsided. </p><p></p><p>As he hurried back to Mist Cloud City, an unprecedented sense of danger struck him suddenly, his heart pounding fiercely as if he were on the brink of death. Without hesitation, he dispelled the disguise of the One-Handed Heaven Covering Technique, then transformed into another cultivator's appearance with the True Spirit Transformation, pretending to mine underwater. </p><p></p><p>His premonition was proven correct, as he felt being watched shortly after. </p><p></p><p>Enduring the throbbing in his heart, Li Fan pretended not to notice anything unusual. </p><p></p><p>While it was a perilous situation, he managed to evade the scrutiny. </p><p></p><p>Along the way back to Mist Cloud City, Li Fan kept pondering the relationship between these incidents. </p><p></p><p>"If I had not unintentionally used the chaos mantra, I would almost certainly not have been able to escape the strange rain. It's truly unpredictable." </p><p></p><p>"But unexpectedly, the chaos mantra could indeed eliminate the strange rain." </p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's view, Yin Shangren and the rainwater bringing numerous identical bodies were extremely similar to the mysteries of the mysterious Yellow Realm. </p><p></p><p>Both were illogical and followed rules outside the norm. </p><p></p><p>However, despite being said to be unchangeable and enduring oddities, the chaos mantra was somehow able to resolve them. </p><p></p><p>What did this indicate? </p><p></p><p>Li Fan kept recalling the disappearance of the "Rain of Returning Me." </p><p></p><p>"Chaos, chaos..." </p><p></p><p>"Rather than being resolved, it's more like..." </p><p></p><p>"Adding chaos to chaos, canceling each other out?" </p><p></p><p>An audacious speculation suddenly emerged in Li Fan's mind. </p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the source of all the strangeness in the world comes from this 'chaos' character?" </p><p></p><p>Once this thought emerged, it was uncontrollable, bringing an inexplicable sense of fear. </p><p></p><p>"I saw the chaotic character on the stone in the mist, and its power seems to have disappeared over time." </p><p></p><p>"But without a doubt, it was the main culprit in destroying that misty world." </p><p></p><p>"If it had the complete power, the original chaos mantra." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes. </p><p></p><p>"And, it seems that the powerful beings in the Yellow Realm are particularly concerned about this chaos mantra. They descend to investigate upon sensing its aura." </p><p></p><p>"It seems that in the future, unless necessary in life-threatening situations, it's better to use it as little as possible." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan contemplated silently. </p><p></p><p>After all, achieving the Nascent Soul realm in the Five Elements Cave bestowed endless vitality and a strong recovery ability. </p><p></p><p>By the time Li Fan returned to Mist Cloud City, his injuries had fully recovered, no abnormality visible at all. </p><p></p><p>However, it was strange to Li Fan that despite absorbing so many distracting thoughts, his spiritual power did not seem to have increased at all. </p><p></p><p>"Could it be used to repair invisible spiritual injuries?" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan was puzzled as he carefully examined. </p><p></p><p>While the speed of the Mysterious Refining Heart Mantra's rotation had gradually returned to normal, Li Fan keenly felt that there were some slight differences in the mantra now. </p><p></p><p>This feeling was like it had undergone some kind of sublimation, but had not yet fully completed it. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly felt a force compelling him, so he opened the True Panel, focusing tightly on the explanations of the techniques within. </p><p></p><p>The previously top-ranked Mysterious Huang Refining Heart Mantra had quietly changed its name. </p><p></p><p>Mysterious Huang Immortal Heart Mantra (Incomplete). </p><p></p><p>Li Fan's pupils suddenly contracted, his heart shaken immensely.</p>

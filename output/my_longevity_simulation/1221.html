        <h1>Chapter 1221</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The earth vein fire, which had already reached its theoretical limit, suddenly blazed up vigorously once again.</p><p></p><p>Fierce flames surged and gushed out.</p><p></p><p>Cracks appeared on the seabed, and countless bubbles churned incessantly.</p><p></p><p>What shocked Qiaogong was not this strange phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>Rather, it was another peculiar creature that quietly came into being before him, amidst this earth fire.</p><p></p><p>Having come to the Xuanhuang Realm for so many years, he was no longer unfamiliar with this kind of existence.</p><p></p><p>It had a name that was known to almost everyone: the Spirit of Heaven and Earth!</p><p></p><p>As the embodiment of the laws of heaven and earth in the Xuanhuang Realm, any cultivator who absorbed it could ascend to the heavens in one step and advance to the Dao-Unification realm.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit of Heaven and Earth was an extremely precious cultivation resource, and its appearance followed no discernible pattern.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Spirit of Heaven and Earth actually took form at the fingertip of this mysterious faceless person!</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>In Qiaogong's incomprehensible and extremely shocked perception, an even more bizarre thing happened.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit of Heaven and Earth, born in the earth fire, did not make any outrageous moves.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it quietly catalyzed the earth fire, waiting for it to change from orange-yellow to jet-black, and then actually took the initiative to enter the Earth Fire Convergence Formation!</p><p></p><p>It was clearly sacrificing itself in exchange for the possibility of further advancement for the puppet sleeping in the formation!</p><p></p><p>The black fire jumped silently, and as the Earth Fire Convergence Formation continued to operate, it merged into the huge puppet body underground.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>The sounds of constant collapse and explosions came from underground.</p><p></p><p>It was a sign that the impurities in the puppet's body were being smelted.</p><p></p><p>"The birth of this Spirit of Heaven and Earth not only did not actively attack the cultivators, but instead, as that person wished, lent a helping hand to this undersea puppet?"</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>It was well known that the Dao of Xuanhuang Heaven was irreconcilably opposed to the cultivators of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>When cultivators saw the Spirit of Heaven and Earth, they could not resist the desire to devour it.</p><p></p><p>And the Spirit of Heaven and Earth was also ruthless to the cultivators who dared to appear before them, killing them swiftly.</p><p></p><p>But what was happening before his eyes now completely shattered Qiaogong's understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Even the Spirit of Heaven and Earth obeys him so much... Could it be that the person before me is the incarnation of the Dao of Xuanhuang Heaven?" Qiaogong thought somewhat absurdly.</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit of Heaven and Earth is born to fulfill its heavenly duties. The black flame before you is called Ink Flame. Its responsibility is to aid in the birth of the Dao-Unification puppet..." Li Ping explained in a calm tone.</p><p></p><p>However, his next thought was not directly spoken: "Distorting the principles of heaven and earth, being able to falsify the will of the Dao, and creating the Spirit of Heaven and Earth out of thin air. But it only stops there. Under normal circumstances, wanting the Spirit of Heaven and Earth, which opposes cultivators, to sacrifice itself to help cultivators advance..."</p><p></p><p>"This command that completely violates the will of the Dao is simply impossible to achieve under ordinary circumstances."</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>"Heaven and earth will naturally assist me!"</p><p></p><p>Li Ping felt the subtle changes in the will of heaven and earth upon him ever since the Youzu people began to worship the Dark Sea again under his command.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of the addition of various factors that the Spirit of Heaven and Earth that appeared this time was also extremely powerful - the Ink Flame.</p><p></p><p>The unsettling black flames even made Li Ping feel a hint of danger.</p><p></p><p>Under the smelting of the Ink Flame, the undersea puppet also advanced at an unimaginable speed.</p><p></p><p>"It won't be long before this puppet is born."</p><p></p><p>"Although its realm is only Dao-Unification, if a real fight breaks out, I'm afraid I'm far..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>They were no match. And this was just the result of the mysterious person casually pointing a finger..." Qiao Gong secretly glanced at Li Ping again.</p><p></p><p>While feeling frightened in his heart, he couldn't help but look forward to the two kinds of help mentioned by the other party even more.</p><p></p><p>"It seems he wasn't just talking big..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping and Qiao Gong waited for the puppet to be born.</p><p></p><p>As Mo Yan continued to merge with the puppet, the turbulence in the surrounding sea area became more and more intense.</p><p></p><p>However, it was concealed by Li Ping's formation.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with such an anomaly, it would have surely attracted a large number of cultivators to come and watch.</p><p></p><p>Another half a month passed.</p><p></p><p>As if the oil was exhausted and the lamp was withering, the underground fire veins at the bottom of the sea had completely extinguished.</p><p></p><p>The lava cooled and condensed into black crystals.</p><p></p><p>Only the bottom of the sea was still shrouded in thick fog due to the high temperature.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the Heavenly Earth Spirit Mo Yan had completely disappeared. Instead, a newly born, powerful aura emerged from the bottom of the sea.</p><p></p><p>The sense of danger in his heart made Qiao Gong involuntarily move a little closer to where Li Ping was.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, that aura disappeared from Qiao Gong's senses.</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong's face changed drastically, and a layer of silver-white armor appeared, protecting him.</p><p></p><p>A black figure quietly appeared beside them.</p><p></p><p>The target was not Qiao Gong, but Li Ping, the Great Enlightenment Faceless Holy Emperor!</p><p></p><p>The newly awakened Tian Yang was too alert. After sensing the two powerful auras beside him, he actually attacked them without a word.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even use the power of the Source Force Essence to defend himself.</p><p></p><p>With just a light sentence of voice transmission, he awakened the somewhat confused Tian Yang and stopped his reckless behavior.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Yang, do you want to avenge your master and senior brother?"</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang's body trembled violently, revealing his figure, and stared at Li Ping intently.</p><p></p><p>His appearance was still the same as before he fell asleep, looking like a child of just over ten years old.</p><p></p><p>Only his eyes occasionally revealed a vicissitude that was completely inconsistent.</p><p></p><p>After calming down a little, the scene of Li Ping helping him absorb the Heavenly Earth Spirit during his slumber also surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that his current strength was entirely due to the other party's assistance, the hostility in Tian Yang's heart slowly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>However, he still stared at Li Ping, wanting an answer to what he had just said.</p><p></p><p>"The main culprit who caused countless sect cultivators to die miserably in the battle with the Xuanhuang Realm back then is still alive..."</p><p></p><p>"I want to..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping slowly explained through voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang listened quietly to the other party's plan, his aura fluctuating.</p><p></p><p>Then he calmed down and flew to Li Ping's side.</p><p></p><p>"It's not suitable to stay here for long, let's go back first," Li Ping said.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at Qiao Gong, "Fellow Daoist, are you coming with us?"</p><p></p><p>Since Tian Yang appeared, Qiao Gong's gaze had never left him.</p><p></p><p>"Do I dare not go together..." Qiao Gong muttered to himself and nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until the three of them passed through the void and arrived in the Great Enlightenment Small World that Qiao Gong's gaze finally shifted away from Tian Yang.</p><p></p><p>Led by the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>A total of nine Grotto-Heavens surrounded the Great Enlightenment Small World.</p><p></p><p>Providing traction for its drifting in the void.</p><p></p><p>And the spiritual energy concentration in this mysterious small world was actually much higher than that of the Xuanhuang Realm itself.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it seemed to be concealed by an invisible force, and even Qiao Gong could not clearly spy on its internal details with his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as Qiao Gong was once again shocked.</p><p></p><p>An aura turned into a rainbow and arrived, making Qiao Gong's heart suddenly jump.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang, who had been silent, also became alert.</p><p></p><p>Longevity Realm cultivator?</p><p></p><p>How is that possible?</p>

            <p>Chapter 1112: The Heavenly Venerate's Plan of Annihilation</p><p></p><p>After a brief moment of confusion, an intense sense of crisis arose.</p><p></p><p>"In this world, only one being could make the Myriad Immortal Alliance react so swiftly and uniformly..."</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts raced.</p><p></p><p>"It's understandable that the fall of the Dharma Transmitter would alarm the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate."</p><p></p><p>"But why would He choose to cooperate with Wangsheng?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan furrowed his brows deeply.</p><p></p><p>With the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate's power, He would surely see through Wangsheng's scheme at a glance.</p><p></p><p>Wangsheng intended to borrow a corpse to resurrect and revive the devoured worlds; and from previous intelligence, it was known that the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate was extremely concerned about the Xuanhuang Realm...</p><p></p><p>Their positions were almost completely opposed.</p><p></p><p>But judging from the current situation, they seemed to have reached some kind of agreement in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because He was angered by being toyed with, or are there other deeper reasons?"</p><p></p><p>The joint entry of the two Eternal Heavenly Venerates was something Li Fan had not anticipated.</p><p></p><p>He decisively cut off the connection with the puppets executing missions in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The last command issued was for the puppets to self-destruct.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he used formations to seal off the entrance from the Lingmu Realm to the Xuanhuang Realm. As for the underground world, the passage connecting to the Youjie Realm was also temporarily closed.</p><p></p><p>Preparing to lay low for now.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan could forcibly initiate the world-ending arrangement at this time, firstly, under the gaze of the Dharma Transmitter, the bait puppets flying towards the Immortal Ruins to attract the attention of the immortals there might not be able to successfully leave the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although the bait puppets were concealed by the power of darkness and formations, the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate must not be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not confident that he could complete this matter under His nose.</p><p></p><p>Despite encountering variables, Li Fan was startled but not panicked.</p><p></p><p>"I have plenty of time. I refuse to believe that these two can keep watching forever."</p><p></p><p>"There has never been a principle of guarding against thieves for a thousand days."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, in Their eyes, at most I'm just a petty villain trying to instigate infighting and profit from it."</p><p></p><p>"It should be impossible for Them to guess my true plan of world destruction."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I seize the opportunity..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Fan slowly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly recalled the final scene he saw through the True Immortal's remnant shell.</p><p></p><p>"Wangsheng Heavenly Venerate, with white mist as his body. He was actually able to forcibly resist the tide formed by the power of darkness..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly thought of another point.</p><p></p><p>"The White Mist Barrier has begun appearing in the Xuanhuang Realm since the Great Tribulation descended. On the surface, it spans heaven and earth, dividing the provinces. In fact, it is the adhesive that merges the Xuanhuang Realm with the devoured worlds."</p><p></p><p>"And the white mist seems to be somehow related to that Wangsheng Heavenly Venerate. In this light, the Dharma Transmitter and Wangsheng very likely already knew each other before. That's why they could reach an agreement so quickly."</p><p></p><p>As for Wangsheng's true identity, Li Fan had a few suspects in mind.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Physician was one of them.</p><p></p><p>Coming from other immortal realms. Viewing the world as a human body, reversing its life and death.</p><p></p><p>No matter how you look at it, he fits this condition very well.</p><p></p><p>And in this world, the Wangsheng Heavenly Venerate attained the Dao somewhat faster than in previous worlds, most likely because Li Fan inherited the "Patching Heaven Record" and resolved the hidden worries of the people of Yunshui Heavenly Palace for him.</p><p></p><p>Recalling that the Heavenly Physician had previously</p><p></p><p>The performance of Tian Jue, Tian Yu and others almost confirmed that the Wangshengtian Venerable was definitely related to Tian Yi.</p><p></p><p>Even if he wasn't Tian Yi himself, they must have had a close relationship.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yi was as elusive as a dragon, only showing his head but never his tail.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Dharma Disseminators, he traveled alone across the void, searching for remnants of immortal worlds in the darkest starry seas to strengthen Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Since their last parting, he had never contacted Li Fan again.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Li Fan wouldn't take the initiative to contact Tian Yi either. </p><p></p><p>He even used the power of the Faceless True Immortal to conceal himself from the other party's perception.</p><p></p><p>"Once my cultivation reaches this level, no matter what I want to do, it's almost inevitable that I'll have to encounter people on the level of the Dharma Disseminators and Tian Yi."</p><p></p><p>"This is because only a corner of the Xuanhuang Realm remains."</p><p></p><p>"Although I still know very little about them, fortunately..."</p><p></p><p>"They know even less about me."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes gleamed with a deep light: "There is indeed a gap in strength, but I dare to scheme against even True Immortals, so why would I fear them?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm just enduring for now."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Although the Lingmu Realm was completely sealed off, Li Fan was still fully aware of what was happening in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>One way was by peering at the various idle chats between cultivators through the Tianxuan Mirror's origin.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhou, did something major happen in the Wanxian Alliance? That highest-level warning bell, and I couldn't contact you before..."</p><p></p><p>There seemed to be a sense of powerlessness in Dharma Disseminator Zhou's tone: "A fellow Dharma Disseminator has fallen."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pretended to be extremely shocked, and then hurriedly asked for more details.</p><p></p><p>Dharma Disseminator Zhou then briefly recounted the cause of the matter.</p><p></p><p>"I knew all along that this so-called True Immortal's Remnant Body was a trap. But I never thought that the force behind it could actually harm a Dharma Disseminator?" Li Fan appeared utterly incredulous.</p><p></p><p>"Did you catch the real culprit behind the scenes? Any clues?" Li Fan conveniently asked.</p><p></p><p>Dharma Disseminator Zhou shook his head and didn't answer in detail.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't ask further, but said solemnly: "I will also report this matter to the alliance. If there are any findings, I will definitely notify you immediately."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll thank you in advance," Dharma Disseminator Zhou said perfunctorily, seemingly not holding much hope for Li Fan's side.</p><p></p><p>After ending the communication, Li Fan began to ponder who he could frame for this.</p><p></p><p>But after much thought, in the vast Xuanhuang Realm, there were very few who had the ability to accomplish what Li Fan had done.</p><p></p><p>"The remaining few who meet the criteria, such as the Five Elders Council and Taiyi Sect, are not easy targets to frame. If I'm too clever for my own good, I might instead reveal flaws."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed inwardly and concluded: "I just didn't open enough alternate identities."</p><p></p><p>"If I had another identity to play at this time, I could frame myself and clear my own suspicion."</p><p></p><p>"I can pay more attention to this in the future."</p><p></p><p>Even though Li Fan prided himself on his intelligence, faced with the current situation, he couldn't think of a more suitable method besides patiently waiting for the storm to pass.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that he had inadvertently fallen into a True Immortal's net in this life and couldn't immediately turn the tables.</p><p></p><p>So no matter what he did, he felt somewhat restrained and unable to act freely.</p><p></p><p>But hiding in the depths of a secluded realm and hastily returning to the truth was not what Li Fan wished for either.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"As the saying goes, the situation is stronger than the individual. No matter how much you try to take control, there are times when you lose room to maneuver."</p>

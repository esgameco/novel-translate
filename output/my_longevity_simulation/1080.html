            <p>Chapter 1078: Xuanhuang Heavenly Destined Bird</p><p></p><p>While inside the bird egg, Li Fan began to ponder how to solve this "Yushou Sect Incident". </p><p></p><p>Since the scenes in the Fallen Immortal Realm were ultimately testing whether the experiencer of the illusion was qualified to be the Xuanhuang Great Celestial Venerate, one must put oneself into the role of the Xuanhuang Celestial Venerate when acting.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuan's smooth passing in obtaining the Longevity Fruit indicated that the first scene was a test of "benevolence".</p><p></p><p>As for this second scene...</p><p></p><p>"The relationship between demon beasts and the human race? Or what kind of response measures will be taken when the great calamity arrives?"</p><p></p><p>The experiences of the past few Fallen Immortal Realms flashed through Li Fan's mind one by one.</p><p></p><p>Time quietly passed as Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the first ray of light appeared in the dark world. Xu Ke's voice also came in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan skillfully squeezed out from the gap, and then ate the broken eggshell clean.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the little guy must be starving..." Xu Ke said with a silly smile.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, we must hurry and activate the Beast Taming True Formula!" After a moment, Xu Ke slapped his forehead, reacting.</p><p></p><p>Activating the cultivation technique, he was about to subdue this newborn destined Xuanhuang bird.</p><p></p><p>But what Xu Ke never expected was that he actually failed!</p><p></p><p>"Boy, you think you can be my master with just your ability?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the sudden voice transmission, Xu Ke was stunned for a moment, then vigilantly swept his gaze around. After not seeing any suspicious persons, he looked at Li Fan with some disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Don't show any abnormality, listen carefully!" Li Fan said in a serious tone.</p><p></p><p>"I am originally a Xuanhuang Heavenly Destiny, and because I foresaw that a great calamity is about to befall the world, I incarnated and descended. To deal with the calamity..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan made up a set of reasons saying he was the incarnation of Xuanhuang's Heavenly Destiny, in order to save the living beings from the calamity, which left Xu Ke dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>After recounting Xu Ke's childhood experiences, the young Xu Ke was already deeply convinced of this.</p><p></p><p>"You mean, Mr. Bai is also an incarnation of Heavenly Destiny, a person to deal with the calamity?" Xu Ke's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>"That's right." Li Fan lazily lay on top of Xu Ke's head. </p><p></p><p>"This time, the calamity between heaven and earth will be unprecedentedly terrifying. Even if the Xuanhuang Heavenly Destiny personally takes the field, there may not be an absolute chance of winning. So it split into two, one in the open and one in the shadows. He took a step ahead, calculating the time, I'm afraid he should already be at the Longevity Realm now."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke was a little dazed: "Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core..."</p><p></p><p>"Then what is the Longevity Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Above the Golden Core are the four realms of Nascent Soul, Deity Transformation, Dao Integration, and Longevity." Li Fan very considerately supplemented the basic common knowledge of the cultivation world for him.</p><p></p><p>"No... impossible? Mr. Bai clearly said before that he was a mortal." Xu Ke opened his mouth, somewhat in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, how can the cultivation speed of a Heavenly Destined incarnation be something you mortals can imagine? Instantly transforming into a Deity with one step is just an easy matter. But I, being in the shadows, cannot be so conspicuous. Otherwise, abnormalities will definitely be noticed." Li Fan said with some regret.</p><p></p><p>"But even so, the speed of my cultivation is not something you can compare to."</p><p></p><p>Before the words fell, Xu Ke noticed that the aura on Li Fan's body changed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was too lazy to pay attention to him, and only commanded: "Go find me something to eat. I'm hungry."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke scurried straight to the Yushou Sect mountain forest, while Li Fan continued to cultivate and operate the [Mysterious Bird Clan's technique].</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>[The Mandate of Heaven is Within Me] Divine Power.</p><p></p><p>Having gone through many cultivation experiences, he is now well-versed in it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after refining the Spirit Wood Realm and fully controlling the Heavenly Dao of one realm, Li Fan has gained his own unique understanding of absorbing the destiny of heaven and transforming the mandate of heaven.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, after observing for some time, Li Fan discovered that the Mysterious Yellow Heavenly Dao of this world is not yet as full of hatred and wariness towards cultivators as it is in later generations.</p><p></p><p>The resistance to operating the [Fake Heavenly Dao] Divine Power is almost negligible, with little risk.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for his weak body right after being born, Li Fan would have been able to directly break through to the Golden Core stage in one go.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the physique of demon beasts is indeed formidable. As long as there is sufficient food, growing up is also a matter of the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan and Xu Ke quietly wandered in the mountains and forests of the Beast Taming Sect, directly seizing and devouring whatever good things they saw.</p><p></p><p>Those spirit fields and precious medicine protective formations were extremely crude in Li Fan's eyes and could be broken in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"Great Mysterious Bird, haven't we eaten a bit too much?" Li Fan ate happily, but Xu Ke was quite frightened.</p><p></p><p>In less than a month, the two of them had already plundered all the high-value treasures in the mountains and forests of the Beast Taming Sect.</p><p></p><p>Now the sect has vaguely sensed that something is wrong and has sent several elders to investigate.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, no flaws have been exposed yet.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the young Xu Ke had never done such things before and was on tenterhooks all day long. But he didn't dare to stop Li Fan's actions.</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense. Aren't I doing this to save the Mysterious Yellow Realm? What do these few materials count for? It is said that there is no greater merit than following a dragon! After the world is saved, the Beast Taming Sect will be the greatest contributor. At that time, they will be rewarded a thousand times over!" Li Fan slapped Xu Ke with a claw.</p><p></p><p>"Is... is that so?" Xu Ke was half-believing and half-doubting.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to lurk in the Beast Taming Sect, using its internal resources to strengthen himself. His strength advanced by leaps and bounds, and he would soon be in sight of the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p></p><p>During this period, a cultivator named Song Yang still coveted the Mysterious Heavenly Bird of Destiny and tried to secretly follow them at one point.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan directly operated the Heavenly Mandate Divine Power to change his fate.</p><p></p><p>His two-headed black snake spirit pet suddenly lost control and devoured Song Yang. Afterwards, the black snake was killed by the disciples of the Beast Taming Sect joining hands.</p><p></p><p>The only threat thus disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and soon it was the day when Mr. Bai was about to visit the Beast Taming Sect.</p><p></p><p>As usual, Li Fan started to play tricks.</p><p></p><p>"I have a feeling that Mr. Bai is coming," he suddenly transmitted his voice that day.</p><p></p><p>"What? Mr. Bai is coming to the Beast Taming Sect? Is he coming to see me and Senior Brother Lu Ya?" Xu Ke suddenly raised his head, full of pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the little guy is quite narcissistic. Mr. Bai is busy saving the world and doesn't have time to waste on you, kid." Li Fan ruthlessly struck him down.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Xu Ke was a bit deflated upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>But he quickly perked up and stared at the sky, waiting for Mr. Bai to arrive.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's only been a little over two months since descending. No matter how fast my strength has grown, it's impossible to intervene in the upcoming battle... or rather, slaughter."</p><p></p><p>"So the key to breaking the situation should still be the upcoming trip to South Abyss Sacred Mountain. However, perhaps something can be done."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at Xu Ke below him, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>Just like the previous experiences, half a day later, Mr. Bai arrived as promised.</p><p></p><p>The Guardian Azure Dragon of the Beast Taming Sect sensed the presence of the uninvited guest and immediately revealed its form, blocking Mr. Bai's way.</p>

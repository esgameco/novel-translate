        <div class="content">
            <p>After organizing his thoughts and suppressing the fantasies in his heart, Li Fan began to cultivate this "Qi Xuan True Spirit Transformation" technique.</p><p></p><p>"The true spirit of man is like the flowers of a tree. Thousands of trees and myriad blossoms, forming the marvelous within the mysterious."</p><p></p><p>"Unfathomable and unpredictable, changing at will in a hundred ways."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan first read through it once, then closed his eyes to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he opened his eyes, frowning slightly. </p><p></p><p>When he first read the "Qi Xuan True Spirit Transformation", he was attracted by the contents of the technique, his heart surging with excitement.</p><p></p><p>However, when he actually started cultivating, he discovered that this technique was a bit too obscure and difficult to understand.</p><p></p><p>It gave him the feeling that it was even more difficult than when he first cultivated the "Thousand Mechanisms Jade Realm Golden Chapter".</p><p></p><p>But on second thought, it was only natural.</p><p></p><p>If Li Fan could easily master such a technique involving changes to the essence of life, he would have to doubt the effectiveness of the technique.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan took out a "Enlightenment Pill" from his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>The plain-looking black and white pill could actually be comparable to the accelerated cultivation mode of the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>This pill was bought by Li Fan's avatar Lin Fan when he went to Jiushan State to purchase techniques.</p><p></p><p>Due to the scarcity of supply, each person was limited in purchase.</p><p></p><p>He only had six pills on him. </p><p></p><p>He had been reluctant to use them before, but now there was a perfect use for them.</p><p></p><p>"The effective duration of one Enlightenment Pill is basically around one month. I hope that in six months, I can enter the door of 'Qi Xuan True Spirit Transformation'."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself, swallowing the Enlightenment Pill.</p><p></p><p>He then entered the Tianxuan Mirror's Qiling state again.</p><p></p><p>Under the superposition of the two, in an instant, Li Fan felt that the inside of the Tianxuan Mirror seemed to become bright.</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of his thoughts, the text content of the "True Spirit Transformation" that he had just read once immediately appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Every word and every sentence spontaneously compared and verified with similar parts from the secret books he had read before. </p><p></p><p>This is called touching upon one thing and associating it with others.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, the text in Li Fan's mind expanded dozens of times from the original single chapter of "True Spirit Transformation".</p><p></p><p>Between the lines, densely packed annotations were formed from the combination of past experiences.</p><p></p><p>And those unknown phrases in the technique also had characters constantly changing beside them.</p><p></p><p>It was Li Fan's subconscious speculation and comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's self was like a general sitting in the central army, watching the evolution of his understanding of the technique in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>His thinking was extremely clear, and everything was under control.</p><p></p><p>It made Li Fan involuntarily feel the illusion of holding the wisdom pearl in his hand and calculating everything under the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The profound "Qi Xuan True Spirit Transformation", at this moment in Li Fan's eyes, became not so difficult to understand.</p><p></p><p>He even had the spare capacity to ponder the next plan.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan's true body was working hard to cultivate, in front of the black stone tablet in the Guardian Hall of the Wanxian Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi finally walked out in high spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, fellow Daoist. I can tell at a glance that Fellow Daoist Han has gained a lot this time!" Li Fan was the first to open his eyes and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you flatter me." Although Han Yi instantly restrained himself a bit, the joy on his face could not be hidden.</p><p></p><p>"But after leaving the Wanxian Alliance headquarters, Fellow Daoist still needs to be careful. Now all the cultivators in the world know that you possess a Dao-converging technique..." Li Fan kindly reminded.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Han Yi's expression instantly became solemn.</p><p></p><p>He cupped his hands towards Li Fan and said, "Rest assured, Fellow Daoist, I naturally understand this principle."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ximen Yue's voice also sounded at the same time: "Being able to say such words shows that you, Fellow Daoist Xiao Fan, are worthy of deep friendship!"</p><p></p><p>Han Yi also nodded, deeply agreeing.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan just smiled faintly and did not respond, but asked, "I wonder what plans you two have for the future?"</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yue scratched his head and said, "I don't have any long-term plans. My current idea is to stay in Tianquan City first, and then decide after completing the cultivation of the technique."</p><p></p><p>"What about you, Fellow Daoist Xiao Fan?" He asked in return.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced at Han Yi beside him, smiled, and said, "I heard Fellow Daoist Han say before that he obtained the rare treasure 'Tiandu Huayu Pill' in the Blue Feather Legacy Treasure, so I became curious about that Yuan Dao State."</p><p></p><p>"Now that I have nothing else to do, I plan to go to Yuan Dao State to try my luck. Maybe I can even pick up some leftovers."</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yue couldn't help but be a little surprised: "The Blue Feather Immortal has fallen for so long, I'm afraid that the so-called Blue Feather Legacy Treasure has long been snatched up, right?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Han Yi couldn't help but say, "That's not the case. Strangely, although it has been eight years since the Immortal's fall, new Blue Feather Treasure Boxes still appear from time to time in Yuan Dao State. It doesn't seem like someone's prank either, as they all contain quite valuable treasures."</p><p></p><p>"So if Fellow Daoist Xiao Fan really wants to try his luck, it's not a problem."</p><p></p><p>"There are still such strange things?" Ximen Yue stroked his chin, his face full of puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and said to Han Yi, "I don't expect to be as lucky as Fellow Daoist Han. For me, finding a Blue Feather Treasure Box would be a great fortune."</p><p></p><p>Han Yi hurriedly said, "Fellow Daoist, you don't need to be modest. In my opinion, your luck is also extraordinary..."</p><p></p><p>Halfway through his words, Han Yi suddenly stopped, his expression quite embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart moved slightly, but he didn't probe further.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he took the initiative to resolve it for him: "What about you, Fellow Daoist Han?"</p><p></p><p>Han Yi hesitated for a moment, but still answered, "Although Tianyu State is good, it's not the place where I should stay."</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>He narrowed his eyes slightly, as if lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>After a few breaths, he resolutely replied, "I still have to go back to Yuan Dao State."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan and Ximen Yue looked at each other and spoke, their faces showing some inexplicable expressions.</p><p></p><p>However, they also maintained tacit understanding and did not ask further questions.</p><p></p><p>Ximen Yue looked at Li Fan and Han Yi and joked, "Then you two can accompany each other on the way, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly, and Han Yi also nodded and said, "Of course."</p><p></p><p>Just as the three were chatting, the black-clothed cultivator who led the way finally recovered from his stone carving state.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since the matter has been settled, don't delay any longer. I'll take you out."</p><p></p><p>The three hurriedly stopped their chat and followed the black-clothed cultivator back the way they came.</p><p></p><p>When they turned into light again and were penetrating downward towards the exit.</p><p></p><p>The sharp-eyed Li Fan saw that on a certain floating land below the Guardian Hall, for some reason, more than a hundred young cultivators had gathered.</p><p></p><p>Some of them even looked like they were only teenagers.</p><p></p><p>This group of people was obviously not part of the Wanxian Alliance headquarters. Li Fan couldn't help but ask the black-clothed cultivator, "Senior, what is that place?"</p><p></p><p>The black-clothed cultivator obviously understood what Li Fan was asking, and casually answered, "That is the 'Museum of Wonders'."</p>

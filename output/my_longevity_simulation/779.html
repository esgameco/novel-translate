        <h1>Chapter 779</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Long Life Valley, Refining Room. </p><p>Xu Bai was supervising Fang Zaiji reinforcing the Yao Wang Zhen Ding (Pharmaceutical King's True Tripod). </p><p>"Sect Leader, we've already added enough heavenly treasures and earthly rarities. I estimate when the Yao Wang Zhen Ding was originally forged back then, they didn't use as many precious materials as this."</p><p>"It does seem a bit wasteful."</p><p>"Are you going to use it to defend against the attacks of the Long Sheng Tian Zun (Longevity Celestial Monarch)?"</p><p>Fang Zaiji said with some heartache.</p><p>But under Xu Bai's firm and resolute gaze, he still threw a small lump of eternal subjugation golden essence into the earth fire in front of him.</p><p>After strenuously operating it for more than ten days, the eternal subjugation golden essence finally showed slight loosening and deformation under his efforts.</p><p>Afterwards, under his careful mental control, he embedded and fused it into the surface of the Yao Wang Zhen Ding.</p><p>Seeing this, Xu Bai nodded in satisfaction.</p><p>He then took out some black powder and passed it over.</p><p>Fang Zaiji finally breathed a sigh of relief, but was startled again when he saw the item in Xu Bai's hand.</p><p>"This thing, how come my spiritual sense can't perceive it?"</p><p>Xu Bai smiled slightly: "It's good that your spiritual sense can't detect it. Please cover this material over the surface of the Yao Wang Zhen Ding, Senior Fang. If it's not enough, I have more here."</p><p>"Something that can block spiritual perception must not be cheap." Fang Zaiji muttered, but still followed Xu Bai's instructions.</p><p>The earth fire flickered constantly, casting Xu Bai's expression in an unsteady light.</p><p></p><p>In the Beast Realm, three thousand zhang underground.</p><p>Li Fan, who had secretly returned, dug out a hidden room, sealed it off, and concealed it with an array formation.</p><p>He then took out a metal smelting furnace and placed it on the ground in front of him.</p><p>"The Myriad Form Furnace."</p><p>"Although it may not truly be able to refine the 'Emperor Beast', the appearance of such a powerful demonic beast in the Xuanhuang Realm would definitely attract Senior Zhang's grand vow incarnation."</p><p>"And I won't have to consider how to control the 'Myriad Form Ancestral Beast' after refining it."</p><p>"The more frenzied it is, the better. It will save me a lot of trouble."</p><p>Li Fan pondered inwardly.</p><p>The Myriad Form Furnace naturally required enough varieties of demonic beasts.</p><p>Li Fan happened to have them here.</p><p>Not from the recent trade with the Empire.</p><p>But from the first time he traded with Little Qing in this world.</p><p>It was the Sealed Life Treasure Box.</p><p>Li Fan took out a red square wooden box.</p><p>Inside each compartment was a frozen demonic beast.</p><p>"Let's start with the weaker ones first."</p><p>Following Little Qing's instructions, Li Fan made a mental motion and took out dozens of demonic beasts no bigger than a palm from the treasure box.</p><p>The moment they left the frozen space, they began to regain consciousness.</p><p>With a slight fluctuation of his spiritual power, these demonic beasts were killed before they could react.</p><p>Their flesh and blood instantly broke down into the smallest particles, yet still maintained their original bodily form, as Li Fan threw them into the metal smelting furnace.</p><p>As if recognizing the entry of the demonic beast flesh and blood, the intricate demonic beast patterns surrounding the furnace slowly lit up.</p><p>"I heard when the Empire forged this, they also referenced information from the Sect of Beast Subjugation's supreme treasure, the 'Myriad Beast Revolving Wheel'..."</p><p>"The Sect of Beast Subjugation is hidden in the Spirit Void Realm, who knows when the Myriad Immortal Alliance will discover them."</p><p>Li Fan pondered as he continued throwing the demonic beasts from the Sealed Life Treasure Box into the Myriad Form Furnace.</p><p>As more and more demonic beasts were added, Li Fan could feel some mysterious power forming within.</p><p>He couldn't help but become somewhat solemn.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Come.</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>Whether it was Li Fan or his doppelganger Xu Bai, they both suddenly stopped their actions.</p><p>A strange expression appeared on their faces.</p><p>"Has the sacred fetus succeeded in forming the embryo?"</p><p>"But this is such an inconspicuous heaven and earth?"</p><p>Just now, the sacred fetus Xu Bai was wandering in the Xuanhuang domain, and finally felt something.</p><p>He found the most suitable heaven and earth for himself.</p><p>However, what surprised Li Fan was that this heaven and earth was not only far inferior to his [Five Elements Grand Heaven and Earth], but also far inferior to ordinary single-attribute heaven and earth.</p><p>Because this heaven and earth was only a small area, surrounded by dark and chaotic void space. </p><p>There was only a barren yellow earth standing in the void, allowing one to stand on it.</p><p>Sharing the same spiritual awareness, Li Fan could clearly feel that this heaven and earth had nothing special about it.</p><p>"Interesting. It's just right to see how Mr. Bai will refine the spirit with his new method."</p><p>"The changes in heaven and earth are about to happen, how will you choose?"</p><p>While secretly preparing for a desperate gamble, Li Fan also divided a strand of consciousness to carefully observe the "natural" actions of the sacred fetus Xu Bai.</p><p>The sacred fetus Xu Bai manifested a spiritual image and stood on the yellow earth of the newborn heaven and earth.</p><p>He did not disdain it, but had a slight look of joy on his face.</p><p>He personally visualized water and irrigated the barren land.</p><p>Then, green lights flew out from his body.</p><p>Soon, some green seedlings broke through the soil.</p><p>The first trace of vitality appeared in this heaven and earth.</p><p>Then, graceful streams surrounded these plants.</p><p>With the flourishing vitality, this heaven and earth also began to expand into the surrounding void space.</p><p>Li Fan watched the series of changes with a pensive expression.</p><p>"From nothing to something, cultivating a brand new heaven and earth."</p><p>"Completely according to one's own ideas, tailor-made. Compared to the risky search outside, it is indeed more advantageous."</p><p>"But heaven and earth is not like ordinary people. Their growth period is often calculated in thousands or even millions of years. This is the most ideal state."</p><p>"I have been in the embryonic stage for so long, and that Five Elements Heaven and Earth is still just a prototype. This shows how difficult the growth of heaven and earth is."</p><p>"Are you going to wait for it to grow slowly?"</p><p>"That would be good news for me."</p><p>This was what Li Fan was thinking.</p><p>But the methods of the sacred fetus Xu Bai far exceeded his imagination.</p><p>It caught him off guard and made him even more anxious.</p><p>After forming the embryo, the sacred fetus Xu Bai strolled leisurely in the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p>After stopping in a certain domain, he gently reached out towards the sky.</p><p>Then, a mysterious change seemed to occur in heaven and earth.</p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p>Thunderous sounds came from within the heaven and earth.</p><p>A mountain range suddenly rose up in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Changes of heaven-shaking proportions were occurring in the heaven and earth at a speed tens of millions of times faster than normal.</p><p>"This is... extracting the essence of heaven?"</p><p>"So effortlessly, without worrying about the backlash of heaven and earth. And..."</p><p>Witnessing this scene, Li Fan's eyes suddenly narrowed.</p><p>What made him even more horrified was that the sacred fetus Xu Bai went to the next domain, briefly observed it, and then acted again.</p><p>Another heaven-and-earth-changing event was quietly taken away.</p><p>Without even attracting the attention of other cultivators.</p><p>Within the sacred fetus Xu Bai's own heaven and earth, strange changes were occurring.</p><p></p><p>There is one more chapter that will be updated tomorrow noon. This world is about to end, and I need to think carefully.</p><p>Please vote for monthly tickets, the double monthly ticket promotion will continue until the 7th of next month.</p>

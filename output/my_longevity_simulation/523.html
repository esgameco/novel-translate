        <h1>Chapter 523</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Therefore, Junior Brother, you must keep this secret safe for me." Zhao Senior Sister said in a soft tone.</p><p></p><p>A deadly crisis suddenly surged in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, many thoughts flashed through his mind. His body stiffened for a moment, but quickly returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>He gently stroked Senior Sister's smooth and fair back and said naturally, "It's only natural. I was shocked when I heard the news just now, it's quite unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention those elders, if they knew about this, they would surely collectively come forward to stop it."</p><p></p><p>"Even with the help of the sect master, compared to those old folks, our strength is too weak. We must accumulate strength, keep a low profile, and work towards making a definitive decision." Li Fan, speaking from his own experience, strategized for Zhao Senior Sister.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhao Senior Sister just continued to quietly lie in Li Fan's embrace, not speaking or moving.</p><p></p><p>As if she had fallen asleep.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Senior Sister, why did Sect Master Ji suddenly decide to pass on the position of sect master to you?" After a long silence, Li Fan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Who knows? The thoughts of those old fogeys are always so difficult to comprehend. Maybe he is hoping for longevity and no longer wants to deal with the mess of Daodao Sect?" Zhao Senior Sister shifted her lying position and lazily spoke.</p><p></p><p>"After all, the world is getting more chaotic. What are these Ten Great Immortal Sects to powerful cultivators in the Immortal Realm, it can be said that they are more of a hindrance than actual value... " Zhao Senior Sister's voice grew softer and eventually became barely audible.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the other party had no intention of saying more, Li Fan didn't dare to ask further.</p><p></p><p>But they indulged in love once again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew that since that day when Zhao Senior Sister walked out of the main hall of the sect, she had become somewhat different.</p><p></p><p>It was just a vague intuition in his mind, without concrete evidence.</p><p></p><p>In the daily life of being together day and night that followed, he hadn't noticed any abnormalities in his senior sister who had been by his side for a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan still firmly believed that there were changes happening bit by bit in her.</p><p></p><p>However, where did this lingering sense of crisis in his heart come from?</p><p></p><p>Even if Zhao Senior Sister was hiding something from him, based on the current situation, her feelings towards him were not false.</p><p></p><p>If she became the sect master of Daodao Sect, he would be her martial companion.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that this was not just an ordinary small sect, but the renowned Daodao Sect that echoed throughout the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he could truly be considered above all, one against ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>Even though in his previous ambitious dreams, he had never dared to hope for such a position.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the help of Zhao Senior Sister, wealth and honor were within easy reach!</p><p></p><p>Where had the problem arisen?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan subconsciously felt that he seemed to have forgotten something important.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't remember.</p><p></p><p>So he continued his normal life while secretly investigating.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by.</p><p></p><p>Another three years had passed.</p><p></p><p>During these three years, with the joint efforts of many outstanding cultivators from various sects, they finally found a way to eliminate the persistent "Immortal Plague" in the world.</p><p></p><p>Thus began a large-scale "extermination" operation.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of the future living environment, every surviving sect had to send cultivators to various places in the world to carry out the task of eradicating the "Immortal Plague" in the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>The duo of Li Fan and Zhao Senior Sister, who had always been laborers, were spared from going down the mountain since Zhao Senior Sister was confirmed as the next sect master. Instead, another group of five true disciples were sent out.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also had the opportunity to stay within the sect and enjoy a comfortable life.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, even though he was within the sect, Li Fan could sense that the environment of the Xuanhuang realm was gradually improving.</p><p></p><p>"After the great calamity, there will be great order. I hope that the tribulations of heaven and earth will end soon, and we can usher in a period of prosperity in our cultivation!" Within the sect, Li Fan often heard disciples making such wishes.</p><p></p><p>As the "Immortal Plague" gradually dissipated, Zhao Senior Sister also became increasingly busy.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly about to formally take over as the sect master of Daodao Sect, she was constantly participating in various meetings lately.</p><p></p><p>The attendees were all respected elders within Daodao Sect.</p><p></p><p>Surely trying to convince them was no easy task.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan often observed some elders leaving the meeting with angry faces, storming off.</p><p></p><p>More and more elders were being persuaded to agree to her succession as the sect master.</p><p></p><p>"Soon, I will truly become the Sect Master of Daodao Sect." Zhao Senior Sister smiled and said so.</p><p></p><p>For this matter, Li Fan not only didn't have the slightest worry but instead, the fear that had always lingered in his heart became even stronger.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't just about Zhao Senior Sister.</p><p></p><p>Within the entire Daodao Sect, it seemed as if a kind of eerie and inexplicable change was taking place.</p><p></p><p>Although he could sense the possible anomalies that might occur, Li Fan couldn't figure out the exact cause.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Li Fan, helpless, grew more restless and furious.</p><p></p><p>His pillow partner Zhao Senior Sister naturally noticed this mood in him.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Li Fan simply attributed it to the increasingly frequent appearance of falling omens in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Originally, after the "Immortal Plague" was cleared, cultivators were expected to live peaceful lives.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that before long, a new anomaly occurred between heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>Previously, Li Fan and Zhao Senior Sister had seen the "death proclamation," which only appeared randomly in the sky when a cultivator fell.</p><p></p><p>But now, this "random" was turning into some kind of "inevitability."</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the range and impact of these omens were gradually getting stronger.</p><p></p><p>When a cultivator in the Harmony Realm fell, the phenomenon that occurred almost covered an area of tens of thousands of miles in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Even more frightening was that all cultivators who witnessed the "death proclamation" in the sky had their anxiety and restlessness continuously provoked.</p><p></p><p>For those cultivators who had long given up on cultivation, just wanting to live their lives peacefully, seeing the scenes of cultivators falling above their heads day after day led to the birth of different emotions in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Grief for the fallen, unwillingness, confusion, anger...</p><p></p><p>As more and more elders in Daodao Sect fell due to the end of their lifespan, a strange atmosphere slowly spread within the sect.</p><p></p><p>Under these circumstances, Zhao Senior Sister officially took over and became the sect master of Daodao Sect.</p><p></p><p>All seventeen elders unanimously agreed with the decision of the former sect master Ji Changxi.</p><p></p><p>This scene left many disciples who were ready to watch the show dumbfounded.</p>

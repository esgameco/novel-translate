            <p>Chapter 1160: The Mind-Reading Heavenly Mysterious Mirror</p><p></p><p>According to [Fu]'s words, only by establishing sufficient merits could the Sun family have ample reasons for him to arrange job promotions. </p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Immortals Alliance is not a one-man show. Even within our Mirror Holders, we are not all of one mind."</p><p></p><p>"So I'm not afraid of you making a big fuss, but I'm afraid you won't be able to make a fuss."</p><p></p><p>It was also under Fu's indication that Sun Luyuan had the previous high-profile, lucky capture of the Five Elders Society's spy.</p><p></p><p>Anyone with discerning eyes could see that there must be something fishy going on.</p><p></p><p>However, those with backgrounds, after investigating the Mirror Holder [Fu] behind the Sun family, all obediently quieted down.</p><p></p><p>As for those who didn't even have the ability to know this...</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan didn't care about them at all.</p><p></p><p>After all, when beating a dog, you still have to look at its owner.</p><p></p><p>The Sun family didn't need to take action at all. When those people showed hostility, they would be silently torn apart by countless families wanting to curry favor with the Mirror Holder Fu.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan probably never would have thought that he would encounter a monster like Li Fan who completely defied common sense.</p><p></p><p>With just a single moment of distraction, he broke the Sun family's blood sacrifice of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>And took the immortal artifact, the Limitless Mirror, as his own.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was a damaged, soon-to-be-destroyed immortal artifact, its value was immeasurable.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in Li Fan's hands, this immortal artifact might not be beyond saving.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the secret room of the Sun family, Li Fan, regardless of Sun Luyao's pleas, forced him to use the Limitless Mirror's deduction function.</p><p></p><p>A beam of light suddenly burst out from the black mirror surface.</p><p></p><p>The light beam condensed in mid-air, forming a white light screen.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the scenes on the light screen began to change constantly.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan saw clearly the scenes inside, he couldn't help feeling a slight chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of Heavenly Patrol Arrows howled as they flew towards various places of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators were engaged in a brutal battle. One side was naturally the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>And the other side was actually led by a peculiar puppet.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... the future Myriad Worlds United Assembly?"</p><p></p><p>In the rapidly flashing scenes, Li Fan saw familiar figures like Tian Yang, Sun Erlang and others.</p><p></p><p>According to the plan in this lifetime, after the Great Enlightenment annexed many small worlds, friction would inevitably occur with the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But at this point in time, nothing had happened yet.</p><p></p><p>This Limitless Mirror could actually deduce future events!</p><p></p><p>The scenes changed faster and faster, to the point that even Li Fan couldn't see clearly the changes within.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the light beam instantly converged.</p><p></p><p>Returning to a complete dark void.</p><p></p><p>From this destruction, Li Fan felt an instinctive sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>The deduction ended, and that blackness also returned to the Limitless Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao let out a terrified, crazed wail, as if he had personally witnessed some extremely terrifying scene.</p><p></p><p>But as the owner of the Limitless Mirror, Li Fan couldn't synchronize and sense anything from the other party.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had no intention of using his essence blood to nourish it and help alleviate its pain.</p><p></p><p>He just let it act up, while silently pondering in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"That deduction light beam, its aura seems a bit familiar?"</p><p></p><p>"It's..."</p><p></p><p>Two names instantly surfaced in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>[Xuanji, Myriad Spirits Converge].</p><p></p><p>[Desolation, Flowers Bloom in Emptiness].</p><p></p><p>"Same lineage, same origin, part of the same set of grand formations."</p><p></p><p>"Limitless, ..."</p><p></p><p>The remaining names of the formations, Li Fan</p><p></p><p>However, it was difficult to decipher.</p><p></p><p>But this similarity was enough to inspire him.</p><p></p><p>"The Infinite Mirror is becoming more and more dilapidated, perhaps due to the influence of the desolate future it has deduced. But the bigger reason is that the damaged immortal artifact's body is simply not enough to drive the immortal-level formation."</p><p></p><p>"The consequence of forcing it to operate is the constant consumption of its immortal artifact body. The more it is used, the faster it dies."</p><p></p><p>"This Sun family is really a bunch of fools, truly wasting resources. If they hadn't frequently activated it without repairing it first, this Infinite Mirror wouldn't have been so damaged when it fell into my hands."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Fan touched the completely blackened mirror body with some heartache.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, it might be a bit difficult for me to remedy it with my current abilities. I still need to find a skilled craftsman..."</p><p></p><p>How could the deduced, possibly untrue future compare to the real future he personally experienced?</p><p></p><p>But just the title of acquiring his first immortal artifact was enough for Li Fan to take it seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, in the process of repairing it, I can find the true method for the [Final Detachment Disc] to evolve and advance."</p><p></p><p>"The birth of immortal artifacts in the Xuanhuang Realm. Although the power of laws may have already become a part of the Xuanhuang Dao, it can't be ruled out that, like the Infinite Mirror, their immortal artifact bodies still exist."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I should pay attention and collect them."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>For a period of time after that, Li Fan's divine sense did not leave the secret room.</p><p></p><p>He just resided in the Infinite Mirror, studying the other uses of this damaged immortal artifact.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also sorted and classified the information obtained from the Infinite Mirror's previous intrusion into the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Possessing a Dao origin of the Tianxuan Mirror and having extensively spied on the secrets of the Tianxuan Mirror before, Li Fan quickly discovered the differences between these two kinds of "peeping".</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, the Tianxuan Mirror also had its own consciousness.</p><p></p><p>What could be seen through the Tianxuan Mirror's Dao origin were all the various data generated by the Tianxuan Mirror in presiding over the daily affairs of the Myriad Immortal Alliance, as well as records of the activities and words and deeds of the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>As for what the Infinite Mirror spied on...</p><p></p><p>It was more like the Tianxuan Mirror's own "thoughts" and "conclusions".</p><p></p><p>For example, based on the aggregation of a large amount of information, there were signs of a decrease in the production of a certain item in the Tianxuan Mirror's trading market.</p><p></p><p>So even if it hadn't happened yet, the Tianxuan Mirror, which had grasped enough intelligence, had already made the judgment that the price of this item was about to soar.</p><p></p><p>But as the foundation of the Immortal Alliance, the Tianxuan Mirror, which was bound by the Transmission Laws, had no way to make any independent response to this.</p><p></p><p>It had to wait until it really happened and caused certain consequences before the Immortal Alliance's higher-ups, namely the Transmitters, Mirror Holders, etc., could jointly discuss and decide on adjustments.</p><p></p><p>Although it did not have autonomy, it did not prevent the Tianxuan Mirror from deducing and judging the countless events that occurred within its grasp every day.</p><p></p><p>These "thoughts" of the Tianxuan Mirror did not have any impact on actual operations.</p><p></p><p>They just appeared and then settled in the deepest part of the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Mirror Holder values it so much."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this equivalent to the Tianxuan Mirror's specialized mind-reading technique?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if only bits and pieces can be read due to the damage, any single piece is priceless!"</p><p></p><p>The Tianxuan Mirror, as a genuine immortal artifact and cornerstone of the Myriad Immortal Alliance's operation.</p><p></p><p>Towering from above.</p><p></p><p>Its judgments were absolutely correct and far ahead of the cultivators within it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled how in his previous life, the Tianxuan Mirror had joined hands with Mo Rubin to set up several moves against him.</p><p></p><p>A dangerous light couldn't help but flash in his eyes.</p>

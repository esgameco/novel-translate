        <h1>Chapter 463</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Strands of green light emerged, winding around the fingertips.</p><p></p><p>She stared at this familiar yet unfamiliar green light, a hint of surprise flashing in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Even in the remote region of Congyun Sea, not many cultivators knew the identity of Luxi Chan.</p><p></p><p>But under the pressure, she remained silent, and Wanxian Island fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators dared not look directly at her figure, only lowering their heads like Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they were speculating about the identity of this female cultivator.</p><p></p><p>In the end, two figures flew out from the central hall of the island to greet her.</p><p></p><p>A man and a woman, they were Ziyun and Hongxi, the only Nascent Immortals in Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Chief Lu!"</p><p></p><p>They both bowed and saluted, their expressions slightly tense.</p><p></p><p>To make the top leaders of Congyun Sea so cautious, the person here must be a notable figure!</p><p></p><p>Lu Xi Chan glanced at the cultivators on Wanxian Island below and said coldly, "No need for excessive courtesy. What's important is to get things done. From now on, seal off Wanxian Island. Without my orders, no one is allowed to leave."</p><p></p><p>With that, she pointed towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Transparent patterns spread from the center and quickly engulfed the entire island.</p><p></p><p>"I have applied to sever the connection between the Heaven Mirage Mirror here and the outside world. I have also blocked all normal communication methods."</p><p></p><p>"Until everything is thoroughly investigated, you are responsible for maintaining order on the island."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Hongxi also understood the severity of the situation.</p><p></p><p>He nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>And upon hearing Lu Xi Chan's words, the cultivators on the island all looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>It seems like a big event is unfolding!</p><p></p><p>The entire island is sealed off, no one can come or go.</p><p></p><p>With such a massive operation, it seems that this is the first time such a thing has happened since the establishment of Wanxian Island!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, hidden in the crowd, also felt a little scared.</p><p></p><p>The current situation had developed way beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he just wanted to pretend to be a fraud and deceive the investigation of Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But Sun Qixuan turned out to be truly formidable. He had actually derived something based on the principles of the "Heaven Mirage Locking Spirit, Xuanyang Unification."</p><p></p><p>And it triggered a green energy similar to the Xuan Net.</p><p></p><p>What's more, the disturbance thousands of miles away had instantly caught the attention of Lu Xi Chan.</p><p></p><p>She came directly across the state border and sealed off Wanxian Island.</p><p></p><p>"I can only take it step by step. If I can safely pass this hurdle, I can regain control of the situation." Li Fan squinted his eyes and began adjusting his original plans.</p><p></p><p>After Lu Xi Chan took over Wanxian Island, black-clad cultivators arrived through the transmission array.</p><p></p><p>They exuded an indelible killing intent, stationed in various places on the island, patrolling and monitoring.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were divided into groups and interrogated in order.</p><p></p><p>The first to be interrogated were naturally the survivors of the incident at the Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>And as the instigator of this incident, Li Fan was also the first target of interrogation.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, he didn't have to face Lu Xi Chan herself.</p><p></p><p>However, he seemed to sense some elusive gazes falling on him and didn't take it lightly.</p><p></p><p>With a pale face, he pretended not to have fully recovered from his recent injuries.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan truthfully recounted what had happened in the Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>"After deducing a sentence, I was backlashed by the Heavenly Machinery."</p><p></p><p>"As for what Elder Sun saw and why he was able to trigger that terrifying green light, I have no idea."</p><p></p><p>Coughing, Li Fan looked innocent, deflecting all blame onto Sun Qixuan.</p><p></p><p>The three cultivators in charge of the interrogation asked for more details before taking Li Fan to a small dark room in the central hall, where he was detained.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan cooperated fully throughout.</p><p></p><p>Cut off from the outside world in the small room, he remained unaware of what was happening on Wanxian Island.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, on Taian Island.</p><p></p><p>The clone "Zhou Qing'ang" quietly left the protective array and headed to the meeting place agreed upon with the stone-faced man.</p><p></p><p>"Chief, something big has happened!"</p><p></p><p>Before being questioned, Li Fan took the initiative.</p><p></p><p>"What... don't panic, speak slowly!" the stone-faced man reprimanded.</p><p></p><p>"Something major seems to have happened on Wanxian Island. Since just now, there has been no contact with the cultivators on the island!" Li Fan's anxious tone was mixed with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"And before I came, I inquired a bit. Before the island was sealed off, someone saw a rainbow light crossing the state border from the central hall of Wanxian Alliance and descending on Wanxian Island."</p><p></p><p>"This lockdown must have something to do with that rainbow light!" Li Fan said quickly.</p><p></p><p>The stone-faced man was taken aback by the sudden news.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, seemingly verifying the accuracy of the information, with a hint of shock, he exclaimed, "It's true!"</p><p></p><p>"What is Wanxian Alliance up to?!"</p><p></p><p>"Wait... this rainbow light..."</p><p></p><p>"Lu Xi Chan!"</p><p></p><p>The stone-faced man's voice suddenly rose in pitch.</p><p></p><p>"Chief, who is Lu Xi Chan?" Li Fan immediately pretended to be very curious and asked.</p><p></p><p>"The Chief of the Strategy Hall of Wanxian Alliance, she's a truly formidable figure. Why would she come to Congyun Sea?" The stone-faced man's voice was filled with both doubt and excitement.</p><p></p><p>Like a hungry wolf sighting its prey, he keenly sensed that there must be some earth-shattering secret in this event.</p><p></p><p>If he could figure it out...</p><p></p><p>"Chief, isn't this a great opportunity for us to make a name for ourselves!" Li Fan also pretended to suddenly realize, cooperating and asking.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed! We must investigate the reason behind her visit to Congyun Sea!" the stone-faced man said sternly.</p><p></p><p>"But now it seems that Wanxian Island only allows people in and not out, even communication is blocked. It's a bit difficult to understand the situation inside..." Li Fan furrowed his brows, feeling troubled.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he seemed to remember something, his expression brightening, "Chief, I have an immature idea."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Tell me about it."</p><p></p><p>"Do you remember He Zhenghao, who sold us the entrance exam questions for Wanxian Alliance? Perhaps, he might have a solution!" Li Fan suggested.</p><p></p><p>"He Zhenghao..." The stone-faced man pondered for a moment, nodding slightly.</p><p></p><p>"You can try from his side. I will think of other ways."</p><p></p><p>"If there are any results, then we will contact again."</p><p></p><p>"If he also has no solution, then you should lay low again," the stone-faced man instructed Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Understood." As the light disappeared from the stone-faced man's face, Li Fan quickly left the place.</p><p></p><p>After having a cup of tea with He Zhenghao on Liuli Island, Li Fan swiftly returned.</p><p></p><p>"Chief, there's a chance!"</p><p></p><p>"What?" The stone-faced man did not expect "Zhou Qing'ang" to be so efficient, and he didn't expect He Zhenghao to have information about the sealed Wanxian Island.</p><p></p><p>"What did he say?" The stone-faced man asked in a serious tone.</p>

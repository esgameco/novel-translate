        <h1>Chapter 780</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The originally gentle stream suddenly became a raging river in an instant. Along with it came the rapid expansion of the heavenly realm's lands. </p><p></p><p>Nourished by the abundant river waters, the vegetation within the heavenly realm also grew more lush. Trees shot up from the ground, forming a dense canopy.</p><p></p><p>"The celestial rivers that give birth to life..."</p><p>Li Fan nodded with some relief as he looked at the divine fetus Xu Bai.  </p><p></p><p>He then left the heavenly realm and began roaming the profound yellow realm once more, traveling like an ordinary person, measuring this land with his footsteps.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he encountered transformations of creation suitable for himself, he absorbed them into his heavenly realm like picking medicinal herbs.  </p><p></p><p>After the initial shock, seeing it happen frequently made him numb and accustomed to it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had read many accounts from spirit embryo cultivators on the process of deity transformation. They all said the transformations of creation in the world were like the meridians in an ordinary person's body - extremely difficult to find without special methods. And extracting them would inevitably cause earth-shattering commotions and attract massive attention.</p><p></p><p>But all this experienced advice became ineffective when it came to the divine fetus Xu Bai. He only needed to squint and observe for a moment to determine if there were any "transformations of creation of heaven and earth."  Then with a casual wave of his hand, like beckoning a gentle breeze, he could make them his own, without a sound.</p><p></p><p>As more and more forces of change and innovation were integrated into his heavenly realm, Xu Bai's personal heavenly realm was renewed daily.  Mountains, valleys, plains, rivers, jungles...the heavenly realm was teeming with life, giving birth to myriad phenomena - like a small world constantly growing.</p><p></p><p>Yet the divine fetus Xu Bai rarely furrowed his brow.</p><p></p><p>"Something is still missing."</p><p></p><p>"This vitality is merely an illusion, unable to sustain a perfect cycle on its own."  </p><p></p><p>"Without external replenishment, this forcibly cultivated heavenly realm will quickly return to desolation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sensed his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai then flew in mid-air, gazing into the distance in all directions. He spent a full day doing this.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, a slight smile appeared on his face. Unhurried, he took a step forward towards his destination.</p><p></p><p>From Li Fan's perspective, Xu Bai's speed was actually not fast at all. He didn't even utilize his spiritual power, simply advancing with his physical body.</p><p></p><p>"It's not him moving, but heaven and earth actively cooperating to shorten the distance to facilitate his journey."</p><p></p><p>"Contracting the earth to make an inch, for the convenience of travel."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully contemplated the changes in heaven and earth with each stride, suddenly gaining a glimmer of enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"Although this time I was reborn by borrowing Mr. Bai's body, it is in fact also a great transformation."</p><p></p><p>"Every undiscovered transformation of creation means the supreme wealth capable of creating a deity."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, every move the divine fetus Xu Bai makes is in harmony with heaven and earth, which can be seen as divine abilities."</p><p></p><p>"Like catalyzing the lush greenery of the heavenly realm, or casually harvesting the marrow of heaven, or this contraction of earth, for example."</p><p></p><p>"With my level of comprehension, being able to understand one such phenomenon in a lifetime is already extremely fortunate. Yet now they come one after another."</p><p></p><p>"What is even more precious is that I can experience these divine abilities by borrowing his body and senses, just as if I were manifesting them myself. With some contemplation in the future, I may be able to perfectly replicate them."</p><p></p><p>"That is, if there is a next life."</p><p></p><p>The myriad thoughts in Li Fan's mind came to an abrupt halt as the divine fetus Xu Bai finally reached his destination.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Is this... the Cong Yun Sea?" </p><p>Li Fan snapped back to his senses, his heart racing. </p><p>It had been almost ten years since Moshā's annihilation of the world.</p><p>Although this place still bore the appearance of a post-apocalyptic landscape,</p><p>the once turbulent lava had gradually cooled and solidified into a hard, black rock.</p><p>The gaping spatial voids that had once eaten away at the surroundings had also healed over.</p><p>At first glance, the former site of the Cong Yun Sea was still shrouded in deathly silence.</p><p>But upon closer inspection, there seemed to be a unique power stirring within.</p><p>Of course, this was something only Li Fan could perceive, aided by the exceptional talents of the Holy Fetus Xu Bai.</p><p>For other cultivators, they would likely only sense an overwhelming aura of deadly crisis, prompting them to flee.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Xu Bai gazed upon the ruins for a long time, but before entering the Cong Yun Sea, he cast a glance towards the direction of Yuandao Prefecture.</p><p>A surge of resentment and fear instantly welled up in his heart.</p><p>This was the first time the Holy Fetus Xu Bai's face betrayed such negative emotions.</p><p>The feelings he experienced here were vastly different from the ones he had when glimpsing Yuandao Prefecture.</p><p>A complex mix of emotions swirled within him, leaving Li Fan unable to discern their exact nature.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan's attention was soon drawn to the movements of the Holy Fetus Xu Bai's hands.</p><p>It was clear that his purpose here was to refine and perfect his "Transformation of Life" technique.</p><p>Unlike his casual approach in the past, the Holy Fetus now moved with great solemnity.</p><p>Wielding his hand like a brush, he traced a continuous line between the virtual and the real, stretching from Yuandao Prefecture and the coastal regions of Shilín Prefecture all the way to the boundless ocean.</p><p></p><p>After encircling the general area of the former Cong Yun Sea, the outline took on a strange, distorted shape, much smaller than the original Cong Yun Sea.</p><p>The virtual-real line then flickered and vanished into the heavens and earth.</p><p>The Holy Fetus Xu Bai took a deep breath and grasped the invisible ring, slowly pulling it towards himself.</p><p>As the ring was drawn in, something from within the Cong Yun Sea realm seemed to be gradually pulled out as well.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan focused his mind intently, not wanting to miss a single detail. The crystalline consciousness in his mind recorded every insight and sensation emanating from the Holy Fetus Xu Bai.</p><p>At first, the Holy Fetus' pulling motion was relatively effortless, but the resistance from the void grew stronger with each subsequent pull.</p><p>Every contraction required him to exert his full strength. The fine lines he had gathered in his palm transformed from the ethereal to the tangible, feeling as soft as a gentle spring breeze yet as cold as silk.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus' gaze remained resolute as he continued to pull the lines in.</p><p>And as more and more of the lines were extracted, the once-tranquil Cong Yun Sea ruins suddenly erupted in change!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p>The previously quiescent black-red magma began to violently erupt once more.</p><p>Countless black, writhing voids, like countless small insects, appeared in a dense swarm.</p><p>The terrifying aura of the apocalypse descended upon the scene.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." Li Fan's pupils dilated in shock.</p><p>"The Cong Yun Sea, about to be revived, is returning to a realm of death!"</p><p>"What he is extracting are the forces that drive the world's restoration!"</p><p></p><p>The surroundings had reverted to a hellish landscape, yet the Holy Fetus Xu Bai's movements showed no hesitation whatsoever.</p>

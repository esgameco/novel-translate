        <h1>Chapter 1073</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The special force field of "All Things Are Like Me" had already covered the surroundings. Jiang could sense that Zhou and the others were not lying. </p><p></p><p>So now it was his turn to find it a bit hard to accept.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he knew about the disturbance at the Immortal Alliance headquarters five years ago. However, the matter was quickly settled, and the outcome was merely a change in the group of Dharma Transmitters responsible for presiding over affairs. There were no casualties.</p><p></p><p>As his main responsibility was to maintain the safety and stability of the Xuanhuang Realm, he did not intervene.</p><p></p><p>In his view, as long as the operation of the Immortal Alliance was not affected, it didn't really matter who was in charge.</p><p></p><p>After all, those fellows in the Dharma Transmitter Council were not much different from each other.</p><p></p><p>However, if remnants of the Xuantian Sect had infiltrated the Dharma Transmitter Council and were secretly plotting something that would harm the Xuanhuang Realm, the nature of the matter would be entirely different.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Venerable had entrusted him with the heavy responsibility of overseeing the Myriad Immortals Alliance. The occurrence of such a major oversight was definitely his dereliction of duty!</p><p></p><p>"I will definitely investigate this matter thoroughly," he said solemnly to Zhou, Huang, and Wei.</p><p></p><p>"There's no time to lose. Please come back with me to the Immortal Alliance headquarters."</p><p></p><p>With that, Jiang looked at the Immortal Puppet Li Fan beside him and said, "This Daoist friend, please come along as well. If it weren't for your reminder, I'm afraid I would still be kept in the dark."</p><p></p><p>Being just a puppet body, Li Fan naturally had no fear. He immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>Dharma Transmitter Jiang lightly waved his hand, creating a spatial passage leading to the Immortal Alliance headquarters out of thin air, and took the lead in entering it.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the long-lost yet familiar aura at the other end of the passage, the three Dharma Transmitters Zhou, Huang, and Wei all had complex expressions.</p><p></p><p>After taking a deep breath, they entered one after another.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the Immortal Puppet Li Fan followed them to the Immortal Alliance headquarters, he heard three distant bell tolls coming from the horizon.</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma Transmitter Great Bell. When it tolls three times, it spreads throughout the Xuanhuang Realm. No matter where they are or whether they are willing or not, all Dharma Transmitters must return to the Immortal Alliance headquarters within a day upon hearing this bell," Dharma Transmitter Wei said with some emotion.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a long time since we heard it." </p><p></p><p>Zhou and Huang also had wistful looks in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance headquarters entered a state of emergency lockdown, allowing entry but not exit.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest space of the Immortal Alliance headquarters, a circular council chamber appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the Dharma Transmitters arrived at the chamber with solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>Although they did not know the reason why Jiang had summoned everyone, since the Great Bell had tolled, there must be some extraordinary event about to happen.</p><p></p><p>As the number of attendees gradually increased, small discussions slowly started in the chamber.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Even Hua is here? Since she indulged herself in the small paradise world she created, I haven't seen her for probably over a thousand years."</p><p></p><p>"Don't even mention Hua. Even Zhou and the others who were exiled have returned."</p><p></p><p>"When was the last time we were so lively?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When all the surviving Dharma Transmitters of the Xuanhuang Realm had arrived, the grand council officially began.</p><p></p><p>With the addition of the Immortal Puppet Li Fan, there were a total of twenty-nine participants in the council.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan secretly glanced at Dharma Transmitter Feng, who was Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>Strangely, he showed no sign of fear.</p><p></p><p>Even after seeing Li Fan appear, he did not show any panic or surprise. He even slightly nodded in acknowledgment.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting," Li Fan sneered inwardly and nodded back in response.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Transmitter Jiang spoke concisely, explaining to everyone the possibility that a Dharma King from the Mysterious Heaven Sect might have infiltrated their ranks.</p><p></p><p>This immediately caused a commotion among the Transmitters.</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Heaven Sect? Weren't they already destroyed long ago when we started our uprising? After so many years, they're still lingering around like restless ghosts?"</p><p></p><p>"This... being able to possess someone without triggering the Heavenly Venerate's prohibition? Isn't this a bit too sensational?"</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, truly interesting. It's an ideal toy, hehehe..."</p><p></p><p>The reactions among the crowd varied.</p><p></p><p>Under everyone's gaze, Transmitter Zhou took out the puppet figurine that Li Fan had given him, which constantly operated the Mysterious Heaven Sect's techniques.</p><p></p><p>Buzz buzz buzz...</p><p></p><p>As soon as the figurine appeared, there was an immediate reaction.</p><p></p><p>As if it were a living being, its eyes suddenly opened wide. It stared straight at four people in the venue one after another, including Transmitter Feng.</p><p></p><p>"Previously, only three Transmitters had a reaction. In such a short time, it has possessed another one?" Zhou was both shocked and furious in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, this is the evidence!" Zhou then declared loudly, briefly explaining the operating principle of the puppet figurine.</p><p></p><p>Gazes locked onto Feng and the other three.</p><p></p><p>Transmitter Jiang's expression was also gloomy: "You..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish questioning, Feng interrupted him: "I object to Zhou's statement."</p><p></p><p>"Techniques cannot prove anything."</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Heaven Sect's techniques are a legacy from the Immortal Realm. I was fortunate to obtain a few scrolls and was delighted upon seeing them. So I began cultivating them from then on. What's wrong with that?"</p><p></p><p>"After a period of cultivation, I discovered that they were indeed extraordinary. So I shared the remaining techniques with my brothers."</p><p></p><p>"Is this also a mistake?"</p><p></p><p>He looked around, his eyes blazing, showing no embarrassment at having his plot exposed: "Brothers, ask yourselves, if you had immortal techniques laid out before you, would you be able to resist the urge to cultivate them?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid not many people could do that, right?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out, the venue fell into an eerie silence.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, the Transmitters suddenly felt that Transmitter Feng's words made sense.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, what's wrong with cultivation techniques?</p><p></p><p>Can one be convicted solely based on the techniques they cultivate?</p><p></p><p>If so, then perhaps not many of the Transmitters present were completely innocent.</p><p></p><p>Even Transmitter Jiang fell into deep thought for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"As for the accusation of being possessed by the Mysterious Heaven Sect's demons and intending to harm the Immortal Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, Transmitter Feng spoke eloquently once again: "I am willing to voluntarily accept the inspection of the [Transmitter's Oath] to demonstrate that I have not forgotten my original intention."</p><p></p><p>He said with determination.</p><p></p><p>"I am also willing."</p><p></p><p>"My heart will never change."</p><p></p><p>The other three Transmitters who were detected to have the aura of the Mysterious Heaven Sect also spoke out one after another with great enthusiasm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Transmitter Zhou glanced at each other, suddenly having a bad premonition in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>However, now that the arrow was on the string, it had to be released.</p><p></p><p>Under Jiang's lead, the inspection of the Transmitter's Oath officially began.</p><p></p><p>In the circular venue, the Transmitters all had their eyes slightly closed, muttering under their breath.</p><p></p><p>In the void above, countless figures of pioneering Transmitters who had sacrificed and died in battle seemed to appear.</p><p></p><p>Densely packed, they almost occupied the entire space of the venue.</p><p></p><p>Transmitter Feng stood in the center of the circular venue, unmoved by the gazes of countless eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I, Transmitter Feng."</p><p></p><p>"My original intention to try to save the mortal realm from calamity has never changed."</p><p></p><p>"It is so now, and will remain so in the future."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 832</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After about half a cup of tea's time, Li Fan and his two companions found a hiding place in a mountain cave located at the bottom of a deep valley.</p><p></p><p>There was a formation concealing the entrance, and a secret method to hide their presence.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary cultivators, even if they deliberately searched, would find it very difficult to discover this entrance.</p><p></p><p>However, in front of Li Fan, who possessed the "Final Separation Disc", and Lin Ling, to whom all the trees in the mountains were eyes and ears, everything was full of flaws.</p><p></p><p>Yet, what surprised Li Fan once again was that there was still no one inside the cave!</p><p></p><p>Just like before, they had just escaped not long ago, and their presence had not yet dissipated!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but narrow his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"Hiding from me?"</p><p></p><p>"Able to know in advance that I'm coming to find them?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it a prophecy, or..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly thought of the collapse and reappearance of Fuxing Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Time reversal?"</p><p></p><p>The moment the guess appeared, Li Fan's heart couldn't help but beat violently.</p><p></p><p>However, after all, he had experienced a lot, and quickly regained his composure.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a guess, it doesn't count as the truth."</p><p></p><p>"As to what exactly it is, once we catch the father and son, we'll have the answer."</p><p></p><p>Driven by the long-lost excitement, Li Fan looked at Lin Ling again.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Ling looked around for a while and shook her head: "They didn't leave this cave."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan carefully examined again: "There are also no signs of spatial jumping. Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Lin Ling looked at the ground at the same time.</p><p></p><p>With a hint of a smile on the corner of his mouth, Li Fan lazily ordered, "We'll pursue."</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling nodded, enveloped in a green light, and drilled into the ground.</p><p></p><p>In theory, it should be dark underground with no light, making it difficult to distinguish east, west, south and north.</p><p></p><p>It's very easy to evade pursuit.</p><p></p><p>But coincidentally, among Li Fan's group, there was Lin Ling who could establish a relationship with the ancient trees of the earth veins!</p><p></p><p>Although the underground space was vast, it was all the territory of the ancient trees of the earth veins.</p><p></p><p>Every move was hard to escape from their eyes!</p><p></p><p>However, at the same time, Li Fan also discovered that they only walked underground for a short while before hurriedly returning to the surface.</p><p></p><p>"Did they discover that we were chasing them again?"</p><p></p><p>"They're really hard to deal with."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, he returned to the surface once more.</p><p></p><p>This time, the perception Lin Ling got was that Ou Daozi and his son had flown into the air.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the art of flying must leave behind fluctuations of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Very quickly, Lin Ling found the direction of their escape.</p><p></p><p>Taking Li Fan with her, she closely followed.</p><p></p><p>No matter how Ou Daozi and the others changed their direction of travel or laid out mazes, it was difficult to escape Lin Ling's tracking.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Ou Daozi and the others seemed to give up struggling and no longer fled.</p><p></p><p>They stood still in the clouds ahead, waiting.</p><p></p><p>"This little Lin Ling is really useful." Finally catching up, looking at the figures of an adult and a child in front, Li Fan couldn't help but sigh inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what the senior has been painstakingly searching for?" Facing Li Fan and his three companions who surrounded him, Ou Daozi cupped his hands and asked, neither servile nor overbearing.</p><p></p><p>"Originally, it was just that the construction at home had started, and I wanted to ask you for a favor. Unexpectedly, there was an unexpected gain." Li Fan narrowed his eyes slightly, his gaze sweeping back and forth between the two.</p><p></p><p>Ou Daozi's son was only eight or nine years old. His appearance could not be considered handsome, but facing Li Fan, who was vaguely releasing a murderous aura, he was unafraid and at ease. He had a unique bearing.</p><p></p><p>Especially his eyes, which stared fiercely at Li Fan. As if...</p><p></p><p>The following is the full English translation of the provided Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What deep blood feud did they have with Buddha?</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the two had never met before, but their posture was like this...</p><p></p><p>It seemed to further validate Li Fan's guess.</p><p></p><p>Ou Daozi also noticed his son's abnormality and his face changed. He blocked his son behind him: "I don't understand what you mean!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly: "The collapse of Fuxing Mountain has reappeared. It must be your son's doing, right?"</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is his ability? Could it be the legendary time reversal technique?"</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan appeared to be only a Golden Core cultivator, both Lin Ling, a Harmonious Dao cultivator, and Tian Yang, a Hua Shen cultivator, regarded him as their leader.</p><p></p><p>Ou Daozi couldn't fathom Li Fan's true cultivation level and only said: "Senior, please don't joke around. How can there be such a thing as time reversal in this world?"</p><p></p><p>As Ou Daozi spoke, he lowered his voice on one hand, while deliberately leaving things unsaid on the other.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was waiting for something!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart was instantly on high alert: "Binding Insect!"</p><p></p><p>The target was not Ou Daozi, but his son!</p><p></p><p>The child instantly lost control, but there was no panic in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>It was as if everything was within his expectations.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he looked at Li Fan with a slight hint of mockery.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Tian Yang's body suddenly expanded, forming a black and red spherical ball, surrounding Li Fan in the center.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A huge roaring sound suddenly rang out, as if colliding with something.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan instantly felt dizzy, and cracks appeared on Tian Yang's puppet body.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Lin Ling took action in time to save them, otherwise they would have been shattered into pieces.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell was that!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan cursed inwardly and glanced at the status panel. The charge level of his protective shield had not decreased.</p><p></p><p>His heart instantly settled.</p><p></p><p>The blue light of the Hua Dao Stone in his mind flashed, slowing down the recorded images countless times.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he see clearly the culprit that caused the sudden change just now.</p><p></p><p>As well as everything that happened in a flash.</p><p></p><p>The attacker that was too fast for Lin Ling and Tian Yang to react to was actually an arrow.</p><p></p><p>Ou Daozi and his son seemed to have anticipated its flight trajectory.</p><p></p><p>They deliberately lingered in front to attract Li Fan and the others to the trajectory's position.</p><p></p><p>While stalling for time, waiting for the moment when the arrow collided with Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>A yellow light emanated from Ou Daozi's son.</p><p></p><p>Then, in an instant, this arrow, without changing its forward direction, flew back to where it came from in a bizarre manner!</p><p></p><p>The yellow light enveloped Ou Daozi and his son, and with the unimaginable speed of the arrow's loss, they escaped from Li Fan and the others' encirclement in an instant!</p><p></p><p>"Master, they're gone. They've run too far away, and I can't sense their aura anymore." Lin Ling said with some self-blame.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang also shook his head, feeling a bit guilty.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan waved his hand, not minding it.</p><p></p><p>Reflecting on what had just happened again, Li Fan vaguely knew what the other party's divine ability actually was.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't time reversal as imagined...</p><p></p><p>Or rather, it had a certain relationship.</p><p></p><p>Reversing the state of an object to a certain point in time!</p><p></p><p>For it to be bestowed upon a seven or eight-year-old child, Li Fan was not surprised but rather delighted.</p><p></p><p>Because this was the only cultivator he had seen since his reincarnation that could be related to the Dao of Time.</p><p></p><p>"Run? Can you run?"</p><p></p><p>"You may escape for a moment, but not for a lifetime!"</p><p></p><p>"Once I've set my sights on you, there's no possibility of escape!"</p>

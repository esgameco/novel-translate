        <h1>Chapter 534</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>No magical beast was willing to believe that a human could come and go freely on the Sacred Beast Mountain.</p><p></p><p>But the fact was just so.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator named Lu Ya not only walked around the sacred mountain but also took away a descendant with the purest bloodline from the Tian Wu clan.</p><p></p><p>What was even more unacceptable to the various magical beasts was that at that time, Lu Ya only had a cultivation level of early Yuan Ying stage.</p><p></p><p>This made the matter even more absurd.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention early Yuan Ying, even if it was the perfect Yuan Ying stage, any adult beast on the Sacred Beast Mountain could easily swat him to death with a slight movement.</p><p></p><p>How could they let such a human cultivator be so arrogant?</p><p></p><p>Although there were rumors later that the reason Lu Ya could freely enter and leave the Southern Abyss Sacred Beast Mountain was because he had the tacit approval of "Emperor One."</p><p></p><p>But it still couldn't ease the minds of the magical beasts.</p><p></p><p>"Emperor One" as the nominal ruler of the entire magical beast clan, how revered was his status. Many young magical beasts with pure bloodlines and extraordinary talents could not enter Emperor One's eyes.</p><p></p><p>What qualifications did a mere human cultivator have?</p><p></p><p>So, after more than ten years, the storm caused by this matter gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>The name Lu Ya was deeply imprinted in the hearts of many magical beasts.</p><p></p><p>Although the Great Wind Bird was said to have a good memory, when the names "Lu Ya" and "Emperor One" appeared together, it instantly remembered the past. Visit 69shuxi.com for more information.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the rumors are true after all, Lu Ya does have a close relationship with Emperor One..." The Great Wind Bird chuckled strangely, flapping its wings and following Xu Ke into the Sacred Beast Mountain.</p><p></p><p>In the Southern Abyss Sacred Beast Mountain, there seemed to be a special energy extremely beneficial to the magical beasts.</p><p></p><p>The closer they got, Li Fan felt more spirited.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like something was rejoicing deep inside his body, making his blood boil with endless strength.</p><p></p><p>The Qing Luan bird under Xu Ke was the same.</p><p></p><p>She let out a loud cry tinged with undisguised joy, and her flying speed increased in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, they arrived.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke and the group had entered the range of the Sacred Beast Mountain. At that moment, unexpectedly, Little Qing stiffened in mid-air without any warning and stopped moving.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Li Fan felt a sudden life-threatening crisis.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Ke seemed oblivious to the danger, still excitedly shouting, "Xiao Hei, look, what's that!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was petrified, unable to move, only managing to turn his eyes in the direction Xu Ke pointed.</p><p></p><p>In his line of sight, he saw a giant red snake coiling and entwining on the Sacred Beast Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Its whole body was fiery red, striking and incredibly eerie.</p><p></p><p>The Red Snake's body was immense, seemingly just a part of its endlessly long body entangled on the mountain. Most of it remained hidden in the blue waters of the Southern Abyss Sea.</p><p></p><p>It was awe-inspiring.</p><p></p><p>Before entering the Southern Abyss Sacred Beast Mountain, no one had been able to detect its presence.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it had appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>With a single eye, the Red Snake was fixing its ice-cold, emotionless gaze on the Qing Luan bird and the human outsiders on her.</p><p></p><p>The immense pressure forced Li Fan to instinctively close his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke, on the other hand, was fearless, staring back at the Red Snake as if he didn't feel any terror, his eyes widened, facing off with the red serpent.</p><p></p><p>After a brief standoff, a faint light emanated from the jade pendant on Xu Ke's chest.</p><p></p><p>The Red Snake's gaze shifted slightly, then its single eye closed.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Qing Luan bird regained her ability to move.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt a sudden relief from the pressure on his body and couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>When he looked again, the gigantic red serpent, larger than a mountain, had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>As if the hair-raising scene just now was just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan knew the one-eyed Red Snake was still coiled on the Sacred Beast Mountain.</p><p></p><p>They just couldn't see it, unable to perceive its presence.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for that Emperor One jade pendant, perhaps even with combined cultivation, coming here would result in death or severe injury." Li Fan secretly marveled.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke was carefree, urging the Qing Luan bird to land in the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Phew! It feels so comfortable here," Xu Ke muttered, deeply inhaling the air after stepping on the ground.</p><p></p><p>He knew staying on the Sacred Beast Mountain had some inexplicable benefits for the magical beasts, so this time he didn't put away Little Qing. Instead, he let her transform into a small bird and settled her next to Li Fan temporarily.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced at Xu Ke, and in his mind flashed the image of the Great Sage in the real world thousands of years later.</p><p></p><p>Little Qing seemed a bit afraid of Li Fan, occasionally showing a hint of fear in her gaze towards him, consciously maintaining a distance and not daring to get too close.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke temporarily put the two birds on his head aside and ran towards the magnificent giant city at the mountainâ€™s peak along the mountain road.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, they could see many strange and odd magical beasts.</p><p></p><p>Horse bodies with bird wings, human faces with snake tails; some looked like tigers but barked like dogs; some looked like crows with three heads and six tails; some looked like deer with white tails, horse feet, human hands, and four horns... etc.</p><p></p><p>There were even magical beasts made of flowers, trees, grass, and woods, having no magical beast aura, looking ethereal and sacred just like immortals.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how fierce or intimidating these magical beasts looked, on the mountain path, they all walked cautiously and extremely warily, not daring to overstep.</p><p></p><p>So Xu Ke's reckless behavior was particularly conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>Some magical beasts showed murderous intent, wanting to teach the little boy Xu Ke a lesson.</p><p></p><p>But it seemed they sensed the aura of "Emperor One" on him, and in the end, none of the beasts took any action.</p><p></p><p>So, letting Xu Ke run around, they arrived at the foot of the city on the mountaintop.</p><p></p><p>The city on this sacred mountain was constructed of an unknown material, entirely white, appearing sacred and solemn in the sunlight.</p><p></p><p>Outside the white city was just a high wall with no entrance.</p><p></p><p>But when the beasts approached, a face suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Opening its mouth, it revealed a pitch-black passage.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke immediately stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>Stretching his head out, he peered into the passage but couldn't see anything clearly.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was muttering to himself, an extraordinary beast, with a mocking smile on its face, walked straight into the passage.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke pursed his lips and no longer felt afraid.</p><p></p><p>He followed the extraordinary beast into the white city of the sacred mountain.</p><p></p><p>The light disappeared and then brightened once again.</p><p></p><p>"You guys follow me!"</p><p></p><p>A milky voice suddenly rang in Li Fan's ear.</p><p></p><p>In front of them, a very cute and gender-indistinguishable child who appeared to be only six or seven years old stood with hands on hips, facing Xu Ke.</p>

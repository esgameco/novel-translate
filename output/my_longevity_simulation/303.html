        <h1>Chapter 303</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan suddenly came back to his senses and stopped his forward flight. </p><p></p><p>Looking back, the black "spatial passage" was right behind him.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that there was no transmission at all, and everything he had just experienced.</p><p></p><p>It was all an illusion that appeared in his mind in the instant he passed through the black "passage".</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right..." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan reflected on what he had seen before.</p><p></p><p>It was too real!</p><p></p><p>If compared, it was even a bit more real than in the Yun Xian Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Rather than saying it's an illusion, it's more like a direct interaction of consciousness..." Li Fan narrowed his eyes, the blue crystal in his mind flashing back and forth.</p><p></p><p>The scenes from before reappeared in his mind one by one. </p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>It was as if one was a personal experience and the other was seen through a screen.</p><p></p><p>The feeling of the two was vastly different.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious feeling of the black and white lines intertwining and colliding in that gray space could never be experienced again no matter what.</p><p></p><p>He could only rely on the feeling in his memory to reminisce a little.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the array formation students present also came back to their senses.</p><p></p><p>Some looked at the black passage that had completed its mission and was gradually shrinking with some horror.</p><p></p><p>Some even showed a hint of perplexity.</p><p></p><p>"While the previous feelings still linger in your heart, go back and remember and comprehend them well."</p><p></p><p>"By the way..."</p><p></p><p>"You may need to spend some time adjusting your body back."</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan was suddenly startled.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he realize that the world in his eyes had become the same as before, with only black and white.</p><p></p><p>All colors were lost.</p><p></p><p>What made Li Fan even more alarmed was that without Ji Hongdao's reminder, he didn't even realize this at all, as if he had always been born this way.</p><p></p><p>"Assimilation? Influencing thoughts?"</p><p></p><p>"As the founding basis of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, the Tian Xuan Mirror is indeed extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>If before Li Fan only regarded the Tian Xuan Mirror as a super-grade magic treasure.</p><p></p><p>Then now, in Li Fan's eyes, the Tian Xuan Mirror was no different from those powerful figures hidden behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>The first time he saw the Tian Xuan Mirror, Li Fan's heart would still produce a greed of "such a treasure should belong to me".</p><p></p><p>Now...</p><p></p><p>Even if the real body of the Tian Xuan Mirror was placed in front of Li Fan like this, he might not necessarily accept it.</p><p></p><p>At least not now.</p><p></p><p>"What do the black and white lines represent? What does the colorful world around mean?"</p><p></p><p>Back in the courtyard to rest, Li Fan was still deeply immersed in the shock of his first sight of the Tian Xuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was diligently comprehending for the final stage of the Tian Xuan Soul Locking Formation.</p><p></p><p>In the Cong Yun Sea.</p><p></p><p>The long-awaited grand play finally began again.</p><p></p><p>Just like what happened in the 12th lifetime before.</p><p></p><p>In the dark and silent night, the great sun transformed by Golden Sun Immortal Venerable suddenly leaped into the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Since you ask me for help, I will lend you a hand. As for whether it can succeed, it depends on your own luck!"</p><p></p><p>The aged voice of Golden Sun Immortal Venerable resounded through the Cong Yun Sea.</p><p></p><p>Then the sunlight intensified, revealing everything!</p><p></p><p>Everything hidden in the darkness was clearly visible, with nothing concealed.</p><p></p><p>The night turned to day, as bright as noon.</p><p></p><p>The creatures of the Cong Yun Sea were startled awake from their dreams one after another.</p><p></p><p>They looked up at the sky in horror.</p><p></p><p>Thus, inevitably, some sharp-eyed cultivators saw the red figure standing quietly high in the sky.</p><p></p><p>A piece of information appeared in the eyes of all the cultivators who saw Him.</p><p></p><p>An irresistible greed surged from their minds. Like moths to a flame, they flew towards the Scarlet Flame in the sky, fearless of death.</p><p></p><p>On the Myriad Immortals Island, the chaos also lasted for a moment.</p><p></p><p>But the protective shield formed by the Seven-Colored Falling Immortal Formation quickly expanded, blocking the cultivators' sight.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's clone also walked out of the Tian Xuan Mirror at this time, looking up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Under the collective gaze of the startled cultivators, with the falling anomaly of many cultivators who died from greed as the backdrop, the Hua Shen Immortal Monarchs who had been lying in ambush for a long time made their move.</p><p></p><p>Purple Cloud Immortal Monarch was still the first to act.</p><p></p><p>A splendid starry river composed of countless glittering starlight intertwined with the golden sun.</p><p></p><p>The brilliant light formed a prison, trapping the newly descended Scarlet Flame.</p><p></p><p>"Hit!"</p><p></p><p>A loud shout rang out.</p><p></p><p>Five silver lights appeared out of nowhere, piercing through the Scarlet Flame's four limbs and chest in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The arrows pierced the body, and the silver light surged, like iron chains, firmly locking the Scarlet Flame!</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"This Haoxuan Immortal Monarch seems to have made quite some progress in strength?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Li Fan narrowed his eyes, somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Flame glanced sideways slightly, and the flames on his body suddenly jumped.</p><p></p><p>Under the high temperature scorching, the air became distorted and blurry.</p><p></p><p>The shackles transformed from the silver arrows were also rapidly fading.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, the Scarlet Flame flicked his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, six small flickering flames exploded and whistled towards different directions.</p><p></p><p>One went towards the starry river in the sky, and the starry river dimmed.</p><p></p><p>One flew to the great sun in the sky, the flames soared, and the sun lost its luster.</p><p></p><p>One exploded in the void ahead, and the entangled silver chains loosened.</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Flame's figure paused slightly, and his real body switched positions with one of the flames, instantly appearing beside Lancang Immortal Monarch.</p><p></p><p>The scarlet flames jumped vigorously, turning into a palm, about to tightly grasp Lancang Immortal Monarch.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the situation of offense and defense was reversed.</p><p></p><p>"How did this furnace worker also become so powerful?" Li Fan was really a bit shocked this time.</p><p></p><p>In the 12th lifetime, the Scarlet Flame was almost beaten down by these five Immortal Monarchs.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, in this lifetime, he could so easily gain the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's because in the battle of Tianling State, the five Immortal Monarchs all had some gains. Their strength is much more formidable than before."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect the Scarlet Flame's combat power to inflate even more..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly stunned, thinking of something.</p><p></p><p>"The five Immortal Monarchs whose combat power has soared, plus the Hua Shen formation master Zhang Zhiliang who is waiting for an opportunity to act."</p><p></p><p>"Plus Ye Feipeng who has fused with the Kun Peng bloodline and has the full support of the Cong Yun Sea."</p><p></p><p>"The total force hidden in this sea area is simply incomparable to the 12th lifetime."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's because it's too strong, exceeding a certain limit."</p><p></p><p>"The will of heaven and earth has noticed it, thinking that the original Scarlet Flame cannot complete the task of burning the sea, so it strengthened Him?"</p><p></p><p>"The soul of heaven and earth, what exactly is it..."</p><p></p><p>In a flash, just as Li Fan vaguely guessed something, the Scarlet Flame's attack was about to fall on Lancang Immortal Monarch.</p><p></p><p>However, in the firelight, Lancang's expression could be vaguely seen, without a hint of fear.</p><p></p><p>Space distorted and shattered, and a golden luster reflected.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Lancang Immortal Monarch's figure disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, only Zhang Zhiliang's faint voice lingered.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Immortal Monarchs, feel free to attack. As long as I'm here, He will never be able to hurt you."</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Sun Erlang did not respond to Qiaogong's words, because his limit was far beyond this. (¯`·.¸¸.·´¯`·.¸¸.-&gt; ６９丂𝒽𝕦χ.ⓒ𝔬𝓶 &lt;-.¸¸.·´¯`·.¸¸.·´¯)</p><p></p><p>One hundred, two hundred, five hundred...</p><p></p><p>Until the number of black puppets surging in the testing ground exceeded one thousand, only then did Sun Erlang stop summoning more, under the astonished gaze of Qiaogong Jushi.</p><p></p><p>Over a thousand black puppets fought against each other, each with different combat styles, making it impossible to tell they were being manipulated by a single person behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>Even at this level, Sun Erlang still had the spare energy to chat with Qiaogong.</p><p></p><p>"Senior is joking. I am the Holy Emperor's chief disciple, in the future I will conquer the Myriad Immortal Alliance, serving as a commander rather than a general. Besides, although these puppets are very strong..."</p><p></p><p>"I am not weak either."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's tone was full of confidence: "Manipulating these puppets can be left to my subordinates. I refuse to believe that the holy army puppets crafted by Senior could outnumber our Holy Dynasty's soldiers?"</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong waved his hand dismissively and said with disdain: "No, no, no, you misunderstood me. I wasn't talking about these ordinary holy army puppets. But rather this kind..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, with flashes of black light, the over one thousand puppets summoned by Sun Erlang disappeared one after another from the testing ground.</p><p></p><p>A spatial rift took their place, and a colossal puppet with a golden radiance as splendid as the Holy Dynasty's Heavenly Hero Shrine descended.</p><p></p><p>A mysterious and majestic aura swept through the entire testing ground.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding seals creaked and groaned from the immense impact, as if they would shatter at any moment.</p><p></p><p>The golden puppet's eyes gazed at Sun Erlang, like a deity observing the world, cold and emotionless.</p><p></p><p>Locked onto by the other party, Sun Erlang actually had the illusion of facing his master.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang looked at Qiaogong Jushi with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong said with a hint of pride: "Only this can represent the pinnacle of my craftsmanship as Qiaogong. Those black holy army puppets just now are merely mass-produced goods, expendables in war."</p><p></p><p>"Think about it, how could I possibly let you casually test out truly high-end stuff without any preparation?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Sun Erlang felt a bit embarrassed, but his attention quickly returned to the golden puppet standing silently before him.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, how powerful is this puppet?"</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong declared proudly: "I'm not trying to put you down, little Sun. Although you are the Holy Emperor's chief disciple, if you really fought, I'm afraid you may not necessarily be a match for this puppet."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang immediately narrowed his eyes but did not refute out loud.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong continued: "This puppet is different from the mass-produced ones. Each one is personally crafted by me, and by the Holy Emperor..."</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong paused for a moment. "Hehe, anyway, you only need to know that this golden puppet is extremely precious. Even if the Holy Dynasty exhausted its power, no more than ten could be produced."</p><p></p><p>"Similarly, the requirements for manipulating it are also much higher. I was still somewhat troubled about where to find suitable candidates to control them. I didn't expect you to have a hidden skill..."</p><p></p><p>"Since you can simultaneously manipulate over a thousand mass-produced puppets, then controlling five golden puppets shouldn't be an issue."</p><p></p><p>"The gap is that big?" Sun Erlang frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you'll know once you try." Qiaogong stuffed a golden orb into Sun Erlang's sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In front were two immense crimson-gold orbs, emanating scorching heat and radiance.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang unconsciously walked closer, attracted by them, only to suddenly realize these were the golden puppet's two eyes!</p><p></p><p>His consciousness was instantly absorbed. By the time Sun Erlang came back to his senses, he looked at his own hands in a daze.</p><p></p><p>His original body could no longer be sensed.</p><p></p><p>His current body had actually become that golden puppet.</p><p></p><p>Moreover...</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang could clearly feel the surging unknown power flowing and circulating within his body.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Just as he was stunned, Qiaogong's voice came from beside his ear: "I will transmit you to a special hunting ground in the void outside the Great Enlightenment Minor World. There, you can freely test out this puppet body to your heart's content."</p><p></p><p>The surrounding space distorted, and Sun Erlang was instantly transported to a dark void.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, he could vaguely see the Holy Dynasty surrounded by numerous minor worlds.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>A silver-scaled giant python tens of thousands of feet long suddenly emerged from somewhere and opened its bloody maw.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, it was about to directly swallow the golden puppet controlled by Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>However, Sun Erlang did not make any defense, only allowing the puppet's surface to emit a faint glow.</p><p></p><p>The silver-scaled giant python was set ablaze as if by flames and turned to ashes in agony, dying a painful death.</p><p></p><p>The python's death was like a stone thrown into a pond, stirring up ripples.</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred unknown fierce beasts surged out from the darkness, seemingly without any rationality, and attacked Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang could clearly sense that each of these beasts specially cultivated by the Holy Dynasty had strength no less than a Yuan Ying stage cultivator.</p><p></p><p>But facing their siege...</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang extended his left hand and lightly strummed as if plucking a zither string.</p><p></p><p>Space rippled.</p><p></p><p>The originally murderous beasts still maintained their living expressions. But in an instant, their bodies had been dismembered into countless fragments, falling like rain.</p><p></p><p>"The power of laws."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang quietly looked at his left hand as a wave of enlightenment welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At the same time as this epiphany, he seemed to see a figure hidden within his body.</p><p></p><p>"The spirit of heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>Even after unleashing a killing move, Sun Erlang, who was controlling the golden puppet, did not feel any fatigue.</p><p></p><p>The energy contained within the puppet seemed inexhaustible.</p><p></p><p>"A puppet stronger than Dao Convergence?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang was certain that the seemingly effortless strike just now was enough to severely injure a Dao Convergence realm expert of the Xuanhuang World.</p><p></p><p>And this was still far from the limit of the golden puppet's capabilities.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Senior Qiaogong said I was no match for it."</p><p></p><p>While his heart was shaken beyond words, Sun Erlang also felt a sense of loss.</p><p></p><p>As the Holy Emperor's chief disciple, he enjoyed countless resources. He even had the fortuitous encounter with the Taiyi Sect...</p><p></p><p>In the end, he was not even comparable to a casually crafted puppet?</p><p></p><p>Then what was the meaning of his cultivation?</p><p></p><p>Just as he was lost in thought, the golden puppet's figure flashed and returned to the testing ground.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang also separated from the puppet body and returned to his original self.</p><p></p><p>Weakness.</p><p></p><p>An extreme sense of contrast immediately surfaced in Sun Erlang's heart.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you were hit hard, right? Actually, there's no need."</p><p></p><p>"The resources we spent on the golden puppet could forcibly push a normal cultivator to the Dao Convergence stage just by piling them on."</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong patted Sun Erlang's shoulder. "You must have felt it too, inside each puppet's body..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"...all contain the power of the spirit of heaven and earth. With such a spirit of heaven and earth as the core, these puppets can fight like fish in water in the Xuanhuang realm environment, nearly able to gain a one-third increase in combat power."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, if the same person controls multiple puppets..."</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong's tone suddenly became a bit excited: "The puppets can even borrow the power of the laws of each other's spirit of heaven and earth!"</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar → 69𝙨𝙝𝙪𝙭.𝙘𝙤𝙢</p><p></p><p>"Short-term explosive combat power can be multiplied several times over!"</p><p></p><p>"In the future, there will inevitably be a battle between the Holy Dynasty and the Myriad Immortal Alliance. What really determines the trend of the war is still high-end combat power. How many joint Daos does the Myriad Immortal Alliance have? At least nearly a thousand. And how many disciples does the Holy Emperor have?"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, you are still too young after all. Compared with those veteran joint Daos of the Myriad Immortal Alliance, you may not be able to get a good deal. Surely the Holy Emperor won't personally take the field to deal with these joint Daos, right?" Qiaogong Jushi's tone was deep.</p><p></p><p>"At the highest realm, whoever shows up first means exposing their weakness first. Kid, you have to be mentally prepared. In the future war, the Holy Emperor may not easily make a move."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang nodded: "I understand this reasoning."</p><p></p><p>"With these golden puppets, we can greatly reverse the power gap between us. Little Sun, do you want to give it a try?" Qiaogong asked.</p><p></p><p>"As long as you can control three at the same time, surrounding and killing the joint Daos of the Myriad Immortal Alliance will be a piece of cake." Qiaogong guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang slowly nodded.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Holy Emperor's seat.</p><p></p><p>The conversation between the chief disciple and Qiaogong naturally did not escape the Holy Emperor's ears.</p><p></p><p>Golden puppets, using the essence of source power and the spirit of the Xuanhuang heaven and earth as the core, turning the rotten into the divine. Using pure resources, they created puppets that could crush the combat power of joint Daos.</p><p></p><p>The inspiration naturally came from Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>In fact, under the golden source power and Qiaogong's modification, Tianyang's own strength had already surpassed the joint Dao and reached the realm of immortality. And...</p><p></p><p>It was not far from reaching the limit of mortals.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, there seemed to be some kind of shackle existing in the dark. Tianyang's own experience of advancement was not applicable to other puppets.</p><p></p><p>Even with a completely identical construction plan, the later puppets were a whole major realm weaker than Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the special factors of Tianyang's body transforming into a puppet, Li Ping speculated that there was a deeper reason hidden within.</p><p></p><p>"The first to walk exhausts the Dao. Just like the Nameless True Immortal who proved the Dao, the Dao does not allow others to interfere. These puppets are the same."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that the restrictions seem to be even more stringent."</p><p></p><p>However, with the help of Tianyang and the current golden puppets, Li Ping was already very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>War, in the end, is about who has more hidden cards between the two sides.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Immortal Alliance is indeed unfathomable, but what he can mobilize will not be less.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there was one point where Qiaogong guessed wrong.</p><p></p><p>"True powerhouses do not have no weaknesses."</p><p></p><p>In this war with the Myriad Immortal Alliance, he would not always hide behind.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could he live up to the name of the Holy Emperor?</p><p></p><p>"Transmitting the Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping sat quietly, but his gaze penetrated the sky and arrived outside the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>In his hand, he played with a colorful and dazzling crystal.</p><p></p><p>Kongming flow crystal.</p><p></p><p>Through the sensing record of the Xuanhuang Dao, Li Ping had initially mastered the rainbow light escape technique of the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>He decided to use the puppet body to go to the depths of the starry sea before the war started.</p><p></p><p>It was not to start the war with the Dao transmission in advance, but to comprehend the Dao in the starry sea.</p><p></p><p>"In this battle, I will surely win."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's belief in his heart had never wavered.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>In the Yanfa Jue space.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the belief faintly transmitted from the avatar, Li Fan couldn't help but nod slightly.</p><p></p><p>Although his perception of the Holy Emperor was getting weaker and weaker as the Holy Emperor's strength became more and more profound.</p><p></p><p>But the direction of the Holy Emperor's actions was still steadily moving forward as planned.</p><p></p><p>Plus the backup left behind, Li Fan was not afraid of overturning.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as long as the purpose of forcing out the Dao transmission was achieved, that would be enough.</p><p></p><p>As for the rest...</p><p></p><p>A thought of returning to truth, all is illusory.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the Yanfa Jue space for such a long time, Li Fan himself also benefited a lot from the constant insights of the Holy Emperor and the Holy Fetus.</p><p></p><p>Especially touching the higher laws beyond the limits of Xuanhuang on the other side of the starry sea, Li Fan had more thoughts about the future path.</p><p></p><p>"Although under the shackles of the new law, one can take a different path."</p><p></p><p>"But doing so will not be able to get the help of Xuanhuang. There are pros and cons. Moreover, resources are scarce in the starry sky, and to really achieve something, one may have to rely on the Profound Immortal Boat side."</p><p></p><p>"There is also that invisible high wall."</p><p></p><p>"It seems to be a power completely different from the Dark Starry Sea system. But being able to restrict the power of true immortals, its strength is imaginable. If we can learn from it, it may be used as a surprise move in future battles with the Dao transmission."</p><p></p><p>"The only concern is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned slightly: "The Dao transmission and Heavenly Doctor left the Xuanhuang realm much earlier than me. Their talent is also superior to mine."</p><p></p><p>"All the insights I have discovered so far, they must have discovered long ago."</p><p></p><p>"So the so-called advantage... is not really an advantage."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that only after a real fight can we know the details."</p><p></p><p>It has to be said that with the increase in the number of reincarnations, the mysterious veil on the Dao transmission and Heavenly Doctor is gradually being lifted. Li Fan went from avoiding them at the beginning to wanting to probe them more and more.</p><p></p><p>And the day when he truly defeats them may not be far away.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts turned to the cat treasure found by the Holy Emperor's avatar.</p><p></p><p>If there was anything he particularly cared about in this world, it was the treasure outside the high wall that had not been fished out before.</p><p></p><p>"The fisherman is also fished..."</p><p></p><p>A strange light flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The special performance of the entire Crossing Tribulation Sect towards the cat treasure made Li Fan think of many things.</p><p></p><p>But at present, it was only a guess.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's avatar also noticed this anomaly.</p><p></p><p>Going to the First Sect to collect the bones of the Grinding Destruction Wind Disaster and the Great Master was precisely because of this consideration.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was thinking, the Yanfa Jue space, which had been calm for a long time, was suddenly broken.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that someone had come to visit.</p><p></p><p>It was the Sun family, Sun Luyuan.</p><p></p><p>"Lu'er, good news, good news!"</p><p></p><p>After greeting the other two joint Dao guardians, Sun Luyuan said to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"I know."</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan's reaction made Sun Luyuan slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"With the bloodline sensing, how could I not know."</p><p></p><p>"How is Ningzhu?" Li Fan seemed to be suppressing the smile at the corner of his mouth and asked.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan sighed slightly: "Ningzhu has unfortunately passed away. But fortunately, the fetus is safe. This is also the reason why I came to find you so late, for fear that you might not be able to accept it."</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Xu Ke sighed, touched the colorful sachet hanging at his waist, and muttered, "Just finding them is not enough, I also need to figure out a way to catch them."</p><p></p><p>"These guys, although they look big, are actually more agile than loaches."</p><p></p><p>"As soon as there is any movement around them, they will disappear into thin air. Several times I was about to catch them, but they managed to escape."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I wonder when I will complete the task that Senior Lu Ya entrusted me with. This is the first time he has asked me to do something so seriously, I must not mess it up."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke rambled on, while Li Fan listened, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>According to Xu Ke's description, the Boundary Crack Whales he was facing now had significant differences compared to what Li Fan had seen thousands of years later.</p><p></p><p>Not only were they much larger, but their temperament had also changed, no longer fearing for their lives and even displaying strong aggressiveness.</p><p></p><p>"They seem more like a subspecies with different habits."</p><p></p><p>"With Xu Ke's luck, it should not be difficult to capture a group of Boundary Crack Whales."</p><p></p><p>"After capturing a sufficient number, they can be selectively bred through the methods of the Beast-taming Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to the conversation he had heard between Lu Ya and Emperor Sanmi in his past life, Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Is capturing the Boundary Crack Whales Mr. Bai's request?"</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, are the group of Boundary Crack Whales outside the small world also his doing?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but be puzzled as he tugged at Xu Ke's hair.()</p><p></p><p>When they first encountered the groups of Boundary Crack Whales that were trying to push the mortal world away from the world of cultivation, Li Fan couldn't help but feel sorry for how resentful the cultivators of that time were towards mortals.</p><p></p><p>From his perspective back then, completely separating mortals from the world of cultivation was a form of punishment for mortals.</p><p></p><p>But now that Li Fan was experiencing various aspects of the cultivation world and understanding how cultivators treated mortals, he had a different perspective.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators viewed mortals as insignificant beings, with the power to control their fate.</p><p></p><p>They even treated them like livestock, isolating them with formations and extracting their vital energies.</p><p></p><p>This was the current situation, with mortals possessing the common-born impurity and the behaviors of cultivators somewhat restrained.</p><p></p><p>In the ancient cultivation world, mortal's experiences were even more tragic.</p><p></p><p>They were used as materials to refine the Life-extending Fruits, and cultivators fighting each other paid no heed to the lives of mortals...</p><p></p><p>For mortals, escaping the control of cultivators might not be such a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if Mr. Bai, as the orphans in Ningyuan City say, is a great benefactor concerned for the world?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered this thought.</p><p></p><p>"However, we cannot draw conclusions now. We need to gather more information."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan scratched Xu Ke's head encouragingly, urging him to find the Boundary Crack Whales quickly.</p><p></p><p>While Xu Ke was busy searching, Li Fan immersed himself in practicing and understanding the Furnace of Creation technique, while also using his secret method, "Heaven's Will Is Within Me," to help Xu Ke gather luck.</p><p></p><p>After several fruitless attempts, Xu Ke, who was usually carefree, started to feel anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Boundary Crack Whales, where are you hiding!"</p><p></p><p>He murmured continuously, his eyes filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Fan raised his head.</p><p></p><p>He observed that the purple aura above Xu Ke's head seemed to be dissipating as he spoke softly, flowing in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>Unaware of its destination, the disappearance of the luck had an immediate effect.</p><p></p><p>Previously, it took more than ten days to find traces of the Boundary Crack Whales, but now Xu Ke's discoveries became more frequent.</p><p></p><p>Through continuous attempts, Xu Ke gradually found a way to approach the Boundary Crack Whales without being noticed.</p><p></p><p>However, capturing the exotic beasts with the "Beast-taming Pouch" was not an easy task, especially for a novice like Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>After a brief struggle, he was eventually able to escape.</p><p></p><p>Exhausted and sweating, Xu Ke sat down in frustration.</p><p></p><p>But soon, he regained his determination and set off to find the next group of Boundary Crack Whales.</p><p></p><p>With persistent efforts, the purple-gold aura continued to diminish.</p><p></p><p>The consumption speed far exceeded the rate at which Li Fan replenished it through his secret method.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it seemed slightly dimmer than before, but it was not in vain.</p><p></p><p>The "Beast-taming Pouch" floated silently in the void, no longer swaying violently.</p><p></p><p>Excited, Xu Ke grabbed it tightly, letting out a shout of joy.</p><p></p><p>"Finally completed the task, now I can go back and report to Senior Lu Ya!"</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Qing! Let's go home!" Xu Ke summoned the Qingluan bird and joyfully mounted her.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze sharpened as he watched the Qingluan bird closely.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring Li Fan completely, the Qingluan bird affectionately rubbed against Xu Ke, then spread its wings and flew towards the skies.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected that thousands of years later, she would become the 'Holy Teacher' of the Empire." Sensing a familiar aura on Xiao Qing, Li Fan couldn't help but be surprised by his previous speculations.</p><p></p><p>Having not seen her for over three years, the Qingluan bird appeared much more noble compared to what Li Fan had seen in the Immortal Realm in his past life.</p><p></p><p>Not only was its flying speed several times faster, but a faint blue light would also radiate from its body during flight, enveloping Xu Ke and Li Fan, isolating them from the sounds of the wind, making the ride more comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Exhausted from the lack of rest, Xu Ke fell into a deep slumber on the Qingluan bird's back.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing continued to fly diligently.</p><p></p><p>After contemplating for a while, Li Fan slowly withdrew his gaze.</p><p></p><p>The Qingluan bird flew higher and higher, while Li Fan stood on Xu Ke's head, looking down.</p><p></p><p>He then realized that the small world resembled more of a scar, a wound inflicted by someone using a sharp tool.</p><p></p><p>Yet, this scar brought life to the surroundings. Apart from the long fissure, the rest of the world was like burnt soil.</p><p></p><p>Sharp red flames burned the land, and menacing lava flowed freely.</p><p></p><p>However, all the destructive forces were confined outside the fissure.</p><p></p><p>The power that created the canyon still lingered, preventing the flames from eroding further.</p><p></p><p>Thus, in this mini world akin to a purgatory, a vibrant paradise was established.</p><p></p><p>"Looking at a problem from different angles yields different answers."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought about the issue of mortals leaving the Xuanhuang Realm, sensing a revelation.</p><p></p><p>Passing through an invisible passage in the sky, they returned to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>As the faint white light gradually vanished, Li Fan was surprised by the scenery before them.</p><p></p><p>Because, just moments ago, they had flown out of a painting.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

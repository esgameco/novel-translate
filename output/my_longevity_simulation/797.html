        <h1>Chapter 797</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"The essence of heaven and earth, born as a human..."</p><p></p><p>The elder Xu Ke was full of disbelief, standing there stunned. In a low voice, he muttered to himself, “There are strong individuals who have left traces of themselves in the world. These traces are deep enough that even if they fall, they can be restored based on these marks.”</p><p></p><p>“Their behavior remains as it was originally.”</p><p></p><p>“But still, they are just a mold.”</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Bai" calmly recounted the facts about himself, without feeling remorse for being just someone's shadow.</p><p></p><p>“So... how can he truly be resurrected?” Elder Xu Ke subconsciously touched the black coffin behind him, asking eagerly.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai shook his head with a smile, “Perhaps you should ask someone fated. After all, even he himself never had the thought of being resurrected.”</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke wanted to say more, but was abruptly interrupted by "Mr. Bai."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, it's time for you to leave," he said, raising his head, looking at the sky with an unprecedented seriousness.</p><p></p><p>A gentle breeze passed over Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, Xu Ke disappeared from the earth and sky, heading to an unknown place.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile...</p><p></p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p></p><p>The transparent crystal enveloping the Xuanhuang Realm shattered.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, the faces of all the cultivators of the Wanxian Alliance, which was very familiar to the world, suddenly appeared!</p><p></p><p>Looking down on all living beings from outside the world!</p><p></p><p>As if in an instant, the whole world was completely frozen.</p><p></p><p>All living beings, even their thoughts seemed frozen, standing still in place.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, the Xuanhuang Realm...</p><p></p><p>fell into silence!</p><p></p><p>From the sky, several dark golden chains of power surged, suddenly binding the limbs of Mr. Bai standing in the air.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai seemed to have anticipated this and did not struggle much.</p><p></p><p>He just looked down at the Xuanhuang Realm below.</p><p></p><p>Under the influence of the transmitted truth, a buzzing sound gradually emanated from the depths of the earth.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, deep cracks appeared, spreading in all directions.</p><p></p><p>The entire world, after the appearance of the transmitted truth, trembled slightly!</p><p></p><p>Under such a terrifying pressure, all beings lower than the Immortal Lord had no resistance.</p><p></p><p>Most of them couldn't even comprehend what was happening.</p><p></p><p>Their consciousness remained in the presence of the Immortal Lord!</p><p></p><p>The tremors intensified, mountains collapsed, rivers ran amok.</p><p></p><p>Plains became mountains, highlands turned into flatlands.</p><p></p><p>The various transformations that the Xuanhuang Realm would have taken thousands of years to achieve now occurred in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Not due to natural evolution, but the violent destruction by external forces!</p><p></p><p>Seeing that even worse changes were about to occur, five different forces suddenly emerged from within the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, they swept across the Xuanhuang land, attempting to stabilize the collapsing world.</p><p></p><p>And the Transmitted Immortal Lord above seemed to have noticed. Her appearing face showed a slight change.</p><p></p><p>There was a vague trend of calming amidst the turmoil.</p><p></p><p>However, the chains entwined around Mr. Bai did not show any signs of loosening.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, they tightened even more.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene below, Mr. Bai sighed lightly.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Realm now...”.</p><p></p><p>“Doesn’t belong to me anymore.”</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>“Then, take it back.”</p><p></p><p>After saying these words, Mr. Bai took one last look at the Xuanhuang Realm below.</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of an indescribable expression in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, his whole body turned into light!</p><p></p><p>The countless dots of white light, like a suspended Milky Way, flew towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>As if countless stars were returning to their home.</p><p></p><p>Finally, like a dream.</p><p></p><p>It dissipated into the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>The target disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The dark golden chains retracted back from the sky.</p><p></p><p>But it seemed that the Transmitted Immortal Lord did not stop her actions.</p><p></p><p>Her face still faintly occupied most of the sky.</p><p></p><p>The other parts of her face gradually faded, merging with the sky.</p><p></p><p>Only her eyes became deeper.</p><p></p><p>Like two black suns hanging high in the sky!</p><p></p><p>The entire Xuanhuang Realm, thus, quickly darkened.</p><p></p><p>And the countless living beings, whose thoughts were stagnant, were inexplicably guided to look up towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Gazing into the eyes of the Transmitted Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>Most of the creatures in the world were like this.</p><p></p><p>Only a few entities couldn’t help but lower their heads, avoiding the gaze of the Transmitted Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>Under her gaze, the Xuanhuang Realm fell into a brief, absolute stillness.</p><p></p><p>And then...</p><p></p><p>Just as quietly as she came, the face of the Transmitted Immortal Lord unknowingly disappeared from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, the inhabitants of the Xuanhuang Realm gradually awoke.</p><p></p><p>At first, they were confused, a little dazed for a moment.</p><p></p><p>But they soon resumed their cultivation lives.</p><p></p><p>Everything about the towering and law-teaching "Mr. Bai," about the "[Building the Foundation with Me]" method, about all the upheavals, completely vanished from their minds.</p><p></p><p>As if this event had never even happened.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Valley of Eternal Life.</p><p></p><p>As the Medicine King Sect members gradually awoke, they looked at the slightly chaotic ground with a sense of confusion.</p><p></p><p>They vaguely remembered that this seemed to be related to a peerless expert.</p><p></p><p>But upon careful thought, they couldn't remember anything.</p><p></p><p>It felt as though they had forgotten something very important, and a deeply uncomfortable feeling surged in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Several children in the scene even burst into tears for no apparent reason.</p><p></p><p>The three Medicine King Sect members looked at each other with a hint of surprise in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Liu San was the first to recover, directing the disciples to tackle the mess.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan glanced at her own hands, a hint of puzzlement in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji went to comfort the crying children.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he seemed to recall something.</p><p></p><p>He quickly took out a recorded crystal from his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to document the scenes just before the anomaly occurred.</p><p></p><p>However, as he watched the recorded scenes, he became confused.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of children sat on the ground, clamoring and excitedly talking but facing an empty space without anyone there.</p><p></p><p>There was no sound coming from their mouths.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they were conversing with a "non-existent" being.</p><p></p><p>This eerie scene sent chills down Fang Zaiji's spine.</p><p></p><p>Subconsciously, he put away the crystal and clenched it tightly.</p><p></p><p>"Existence erased..."</p><p></p><p>This thought flashed through his mind instantly, and the abnormal scenes that had just happened in the Medicine King Sect weighed heavily on his heart.</p><p></p><p>He decided to bury this secret deep in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He would never mention it to anyone again.</p><p></p><p>It took a full seven days for the Valley of Eternal Life to gradually return to order.</p><p></p><p>During the cleanup of the ruins, a child named Gu Xinghan found a crystal-clear jade disc beneath the rubble.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>There are two more updates tonight.</p>

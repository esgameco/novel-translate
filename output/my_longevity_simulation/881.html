            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the association recently received some news. A new 69 book bar 89 SHUX.com"</p><p></p><p>"In the next ten years, two Earthly Marvels will be born in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"It's two of them."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli revealed a bombshell.</p><p></p><p>"One of them is in this Congyun Sea. It is a 'Vast Sea Pearl', containing the endless power of the ocean."</p><p></p><p>"The other is in Guanglan State. It is the 'Hundred Thousand Mountains Cauldron', gestating an endless mountain range within, profoundly mysterious."</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi's bodies couldn't help but tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Earthly Marvels?"</p><p></p><p>Treasures of this level were something they only dared to dream about.</p><p></p><p>"If you are willing, the association can help you obtain these two items." Ji Shaoli said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi were stunned on the spot.</p><p></p><p>They suspected they had misheard.</p><p></p><p>The two brothers...</p><p></p><p>What virtue and ability did they have?</p><p></p><p>As if he could see their thoughts, Ji Shaoli patted their shoulders: "You two don't need to belittle yourselves. Although those so-called heaven's pride have better family backgrounds and talent than you."</p><p></p><p>"But in our association, what we value most is character!"</p><p></p><p>"Your ambition is no weaker than any heaven's pride I've seen in my life!" Ji Shaoli said firmly.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi were dazed.</p><p></p><p>Am I really that strong? </p><p></p><p>This thought emerged in both their minds. New 79 book bar → 79shux.com</p><p></p><p>"I believe that if given a high enough starting point, it will be enough for you to go toe-to-toe with those heaven's pride!" Ji Shaoli said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Are you willing?" He asked again.</p><p></p><p>Although they still didn't dare to believe such good fortune would happen to them,</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it the other way, what did the two brothers have to be deceived about now?</p><p></p><p>If they could really be fortunate enough to obtain the Earthly Marvels...</p><p></p><p>Then even if they died, there would be no regrets, right?</p><p></p><p>The two who had struggled in the wilderness for half their lives immediately nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"If we can really use the Earthly Marvels to build our foundation, I will definitely serve the association unto death!" Kou Hong said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>Dao Xuanzi made the same solemn vow.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Then this matter is settled." Ji Shaoli made the decision on the spot.</p><p></p><p>The Vast Sea Pearl was an old friend of Li Fan's. </p><p></p><p>The Hundred Thousand Mountains Cauldron was also an Earthly Marvel that Li Fan had previously investigated and knew would emerge around this time.</p><p></p><p>They were actually quite valuable.</p><p></p><p>But as his cultivation increased day by day, these Earthly Marvels were useless to him.</p><p></p><p>Rather than letting the Immortal Alliance discover and occupy them,</p><p></p><p>It was better to use them to strengthen the power of the Myriad Realms Association. New 69 book bar → 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>As for why he chose Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi...</p><p></p><p>It was purely Li Taishi's whim at the moment.</p><p></p><p>After all, to him, the difference between peerless heaven's pride and Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi who were stuck at Foundation Establishment their whole lives before dying of old age was not essential.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, the talent of these two is not too bad. At the very least, judging from their performance in the battle at Daxuan Capital that day, their actual combat power far surpasses ordinary cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"Since the fate of their lives in this world has already deviated so much, then I'll add more fuel to the fire and see where their limits ultimately lie!"</p><p></p><p>While thinking this, Ji Shaoli protected the two brothers.</p><p></p><p>He took out various treasures, minimizing the danger in the process of them rebuilding their foundation after shattering their pills.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, in this world, they</p><p></p><p>Two people appeared before Li Fan, which was a bit beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>And in today's Xuanhuang Realm, things that could barely bring Li Fan a little surprise...</p><p></p><p>Were truly few and far between.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, there was today's attempt.</p><p></p><p>However, for Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi, this day could be said to have completely changed their destiny. It was just a casual attempt by Li Fan's avatar Ji Shaoli, who had been staying on Haixuan Island for too long and was bored out of his mind.</p><p></p><p>He didn't really care about the outcome.</p><p></p><p>What Li Fan truly cared about was only himself.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the Lingmu Realm, Li Fan's true body was immersed in meditation, merging with the Five Elements Grand Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the surging power of the five elements, he tried to contain it in one place.</p><p></p><p>"The five elements converge into one, the infinite void is full and empty; its power is endless, the soul is immortal."</p><p></p><p>"With an inexhaustible supply of the power of the five elements, it is enough to push my [Infinite Void Method] to a whole new level."</p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's exquisite manipulation, the power of the five elements perfectly converged into one.</p><p></p><p>It formed a kind of unknown energy that Li Fan had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's soul seemed to have been starved for a long time, suddenly sensing a hint of the aroma of food.</p><p></p><p>A sense of hunger came in waves, making Li Fan almost think that the side effect of the [Hunger] spell had reappeared.</p><p></p><p>However, he quickly discerned that this was a natural reaction of the soul after sensing something that would greatly benefit itself.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, he swallowed this unknown energy like a whale swallowing water.</p><p></p><p>Similar to the feeling of swallowing the Intention Horse before, his soul felt like it was soaking in a hot spring, feeling warm all over.</p><p></p><p>However, the difference between the two was that the effect of the [Intention Horse] was only temporary.</p><p></p><p>Once digested, the nourishment to the soul also disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>But this Infinite Void Method, as long as the five elements transformation provided by Li Fan never ceased, it would never stop!</p><p></p><p>If taking the Intention Horse was like taking a hot water bath, with the water temperature quickly dropping.</p><p></p><p>Then this Infinite Void was like a hot spring that always maintained its temperature.</p><p></p><p>Under constant nourishment, Li Fan's soul rapidly grew at a rate that he could almost discern himself.</p><p></p><p>If before in the Great Mystery, the initial formation of protection was just wearing a straw raincoat outside the soul.</p><p></p><p>Then at this moment, with the distant rotation of the Infinite Void Method, Li Fan felt that his soul no longer needed the shelter of any external objects.</p><p></p><p>Relying on itself alone, it was as strong as steel.</p><p></p><p>No matter how the outside world raged with wind and rain, I remained unmoved!</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps this is also because my previous soul strength was too low, so the effect of cultivation would be so remarkable."</p><p></p><p>However, not long after, Li Fan felt that the Infinite Void Method had already begun to decline, and he realized.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Immortals Alliance keeps a very tight watch on the soul cultivation methods. Without the help of the Derivation Orb, even if I reincarnate through all lifetimes, I haven't found many good ones."</p><p></p><p>"But after today, it will be different."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes, immersed in the mind cultivation of the Infinite Void Method.</p><p></p><p>It had been a long time since he had felt the joy of rapid growth in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if with the growth of the soul, its true functions will become different?"</p><p></p><p>A thought suddenly appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan awoke from his seclusion, the first thing he did was to test the so-called immortal soul effect of the [Infinite Void Method].</p><p></p><p>In his memory, there was a secret technique that temporarily greatly increased one's cultivation at the cost of burning one's own soul: [Soul Burning Formula].</p>

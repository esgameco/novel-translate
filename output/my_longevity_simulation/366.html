        <h1>Chapter 366</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After a while, Li Fan, who had finished reading the entire jade slip, couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>The content recorded in the jade slip was naturally about the "Life and Death Profound Technique" that Zhong Shentong had mentioned before practicing.</p><p></p><p>It was a half-torn manuscript, and it was unclear where it came from.</p><p></p><p>The essence of the technique was quite mysterious.</p><p></p><p>The first section of the method clearly stated its purpose.</p><p></p><p>It believed that everything in the world would ultimately face death.</p><p></p><p>Birds, beasts, plants, humans.</p><p></p><p>Even cultivators, demonic beasts, and even the heavens and the earth themselves.</p><p></p><p>None could escape this fate.</p><p></p><p>If one wanted to transcend death, they could only do so before death arrived for them.</p><p></p><p>By achieving a state of simultaneous living and dying, neither fully alive nor fully dead in a superimposed state of life and death.</p><p></p><p>This was also the highest realm envisioned by the technique.</p><p></p><p>To achieve "coexistence of life and death," one needed an unparalleled understanding and recognition of the essence of life and death.</p><p></p><p>The "Life and Death Sensing Chapter" was a method within the technique used to comprehend life and death.</p><p></p><p>Starting from the initial "attachment to life and fear of death," to "abandoning life and forgetting death," and then to "coexistence of life and death."</p><p></p><p>The "Life and Death Profound Technique" was such a unique technique that utilized the power of life and death for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Due to its lofty ideals, the content of the technique was extremely profound and difficult to grasp.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the "Mysterious Spiritual Transformation," it was even more profound.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because the founder of the technique had not yet reached the realm of being neither alive nor dead.</p><p></p><p>The latter half of the cultivation content of the technique was mostly speculative and conjectural.</p><p></p><p>Having skimmed through it briefly, Li Fan could see a few contradictions here and there.</p><p></p><p>"The technique is good, but it is a pity that it's incomplete. If it were complete, it could still be somewhat useful. For now, it can only serve as a reference."</p><p></p><p>"And unfortunately, it seems that Zhong Shentong's Seven-Colored Divine Light has no connection to this 'Life and Death Profound Technique.'"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>After putting away the jade slip, Li Fan pondered for a moment and attempted to activate the "Life and Death Sensing Chapter."</p><p></p><p>This chapter was a prerequisite method in the "Life and Death Profound Technique," which even ordinary people could practice.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Li Fan had no problem with it.</p><p></p><p>Every word and every sentence quietly flowed in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>After three days and nights, Li Fan, who was meditating with closed eyes, suddenly felt a commotion in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Numerous scenes appeared before his eyes in an instant.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had vaguely returned to the past, experiencing the vitality during the Three Yuan, the unrestrained actions in the Empress Dowager's palace, the arrogance of ruling the world...</p><p></p><p>And then the challenges he faced, breaking through the Immortality Array, finally arriving in the cultivating world.</p><p></p><p>From an ordinary person to cultivating Qi, foundation building, core formation.</p><p></p><p>Every exciting moment from his past life rushed to the forefront of his mind.</p><p></p><p>Making Li Fan feel as if he were experiencing it all over again.</p><p></p><p>During this abrupt interruption of time, many joyous events were overlaid.</p><p></p><p>Even with Li Fan's strong will, he couldn't help but feel somewhat dreamy and joyful.</p><p></p><p>Just when this joyous atmosphere reached its peak...</p><p></p><p>All the scenes shattered like bubbles, one after another.</p><p></p><p>In their place were the near-death moments Li Fan had encountered in the past.</p><p></p><p>"Father, father..."</p><p></p><p>"Husband!"</p><p></p><p>Faint cries of extreme sadness echoed in his ears. This was from his first life, when he had not yet awakened the True Stillness and was about to die from illness.</p><p></p><p>"It's just seeking a slim chance of survival!" Kou Hong's crazed laughter accompanied by a deafening roar and a sky full of flames appeared before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>This was from his second life, the battle between Dao Xuanzi and Kou Hong which destroyed Xuanjing City, and Li Fan narrowly escaped death.</p><p></p><p>The boundary-breaking whale of the Immortality Array, the rapid aging turning into the sea, the pursuit of the Elder Guardians...</p><p></p><p>One fatal crisis after another seemed to descend upon Li Fan at the same moment.</p><p></p><p>The fear in his heart was overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snapped out of his meditation.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The remaining half of the mantra had yet to be uttered in his mind.</p><p></p><p>In an instant of hesitation, the terrifying imagery disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan finally calmed down.</p><p></p><p>His body was drenched in cold sweat, and his breath was as rapid as someone escaping death.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered as he looked back on the recent experience.</p><p></p><p>"I failed in my cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"This 'Life and Death Sensing Chapter' touches upon the fear of death within, far from being simple illusions."</p><p></p><p>"It's more like a true illusion, the more real it feels inside one's heart, that is the truth."</p><p></p><p>"If one truly falls into it and cannot distinguish between what's real and what's not, I'm afraid there's a real possibility of being scared to death by oneself."</p><p></p><p>"It's not surprising that Zhong Shentong went mad..."</p><p></p><p>"Only by doing so can one truly experience the fear of death."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Li Fan sighed faintly.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, this method is of no use to me."</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary people face death threats with fear and despair naturally."</p><p></p><p>"But I am different."</p><p></p><p>"No matter the situation, I have a lifeline."</p><p></p><p>"That is my True Stillness."</p><p></p><p>"When the sensitivity to life and death is pushed to the extreme, facing an actual threat of death, I will instinctively invoke True Stillness and start all over again..."</p><p></p><p>"Wait a minute..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan thought of something, his expression changing slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Yellow Heart-refining Mantra..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly standing up, Li Fan's thoughts raced.</p><p></p><p>Walking back and forth, he contemplated the feasibility.</p><p></p><p>"Resisting the innate impulse in the heart in counter-cultivating the mind."</p><p></p><p>"And for me, the greatest instinct is to call upon True Stillness in the face of imminent death."</p><p></p><p>"If I were to counter-cultivate my mind in this way, the results would undoubtedly be incredible."</p><p></p><p>"However, it is impossible to truly abandon True Stillness at the moment of life and death."</p><p></p><p>"With the sensitivity technique, this wouldn't be a problem."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered, and after a brief moment, he stabilized his mind.</p><p></p><p>He reactivated the sensing method.</p><p></p><p>When the beauty of life was completely shattered, and death threats resurfaced once again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan still couldn't break free from the habit that seemed engraved deep into his soul and called upon True Stillness.</p><p></p><p>The second attempt failed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan persevered, trying for the third, fourth time...</p><p></p><p>Until after fifty-six attempts.</p><p></p><p>Facing the vision of the Heavenly Doctor, Li Fan activated the "Mysterious Yellow Heart-refining Mantra."</p><p></p><p>While forcefully suppressing the instinctive urge to call upon True Stillness.</p><p></p><p>But the threat of death did not disappear with Li Fan's restraint.</p><p></p><p>It became even more real.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Heavenly Doctor became clearer before him, and the spiritual alarm in Li Fan's heart continued to sound wildly.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Li Fan was sweating profusely as he emerged from the meditation of life and death sensitivity.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps this sensitivity chapter can only truly face death without harming oneself after reaching the stage of abandoning life and forgetting death."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was well aware that if he had stubbornly persisted just now, even if he didn't fall on the spot, the outcome would have been far from good.</p><p></p><p>"This technique is indeed somewhat mysterious."</p><p></p><p>"However, the short moment just now also brought enormous gains."</p><p></p><p>In the large grinding disk of heart-refining, compared to the previous experiences of crossing the white mist and seeking help at the risk of death, a bit more coolness was poured down upon him.</p>

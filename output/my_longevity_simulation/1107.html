            <p>Chapter 1105: The Profound Yellow Life and Death Transformation</p><p></p><p>Despite their doubts, they still had great faith in Zhang Haobo, who had repeatedly led them through perilous storms and brought them back from the brink of death.</p><p></p><p>No one chose to turn back; they all obediently followed along and embarked on an unknown journey.</p><p></p><p>Observing this group of people slowly disappearing into the distance, Li Fan also fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"Even among a group of ordinary people, there are those like Zhang Haobo who can sense the impending disaster before it arrives."</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention the countless cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that perhaps I was a bit too optimistic. Although everything has been arranged discreetly enough, there's no guarantee that someone with a destined fate won't discover something unusual due to various coincidences."</p><p></p><p>"If you want to cover up something, the best method is to use another matter to attract people's attention."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed, and he instantly had an idea in his mind.</p><p></p><p>However, for now, he would quietly watch the grand spectacle of the Blazing Flame Scorching Sea unfold.</p><p></p><p>Not long after Zhang Haobo and the others left.</p><p></p><p>Chi Yan, who had been sitting cross-legged, finally made his move.</p><p></p><p>The flame dragons coiled around his body revealed excited gazes and instantly transformed into countless strands of crimson flames, frantically rushing towards every part of the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>The seawater's temperature rose at a terrifying speed, and fear spread among the creatures that had not yet left the sea of clouds.</p><p></p><p>Faced with this dire situation, some cultivators rose up to fight back.</p><p></p><p>But the highest among them was only at the Hua Shen realm, so how could they be a match for the enhanced Chi Yan?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's attention was not on the rapidly vanishing lives.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he silently observed the changes in heaven and earth itself.</p><p></p><p>"Rebirth amidst destruction."</p><p></p><p>"Revival amidst ruin."</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Flame Scorching Sea lasted for three whole months.</p><p></p><p>The ocean dried up, the earth was scorched for a thousand miles, and the vast sea turned into deep valleys.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan, who had witnessed this scene from beginning to end, vaguely sensed the hidden vitality within it.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Profound Yellow Life and Death Transformation."</p><p></p><p>"By comprehending this, I can now advance to the Hua Shen realm at any time. Moreover, just like the Five Elements Grand Hollow Heaven at the Yuan Ying realm, once I advance, I will definitely be the strongest among Hua Shen cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"What a pity..."</p><p></p><p>"My ambition does not end here."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took a deep breath and forcibly suppressed the spiritual power stirring within his body.</p><p></p><p>"How can the life and death transformation of a local area in the Xuanhuang Realm compare to the instinctive response of the entire world amidst the crisis of apocalypse?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled the various insights he had gained from studying the "Patching Heaven Record" over the years.</p><p></p><p>When faced with a life-or-death crisis, people often unleash power that surpasses their limits.</p><p></p><p>The world is the same.</p><p></p><p>The moment the apocalyptic crisis descends, the Dao of Heaven in the Xuanhuang Realm will undergo various profound self-transformations in that instant, seeking a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>The transformations born at that time will far exceed those during periods of stable operation.</p><p></p><p>"If successful, my strength after advancing to Hua Shen will be even greater than estimated."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore..."</p><p></p><p>"No one can stop me!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes were filled with indifference as he turned and left.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>Ou Daozi carefully examined the corpse before him.</p><p></p><p>"Incredible, incredible."</p><p></p><p>"This was really created by you, Senior Shangshi? If you hadn't personally told me, I would have almost believed that this was truly an immortal's remnant body."</p><p></p><p>"After all, the feeling it gives me is almost identical to when Shang Tian was by my side."</p><p></p><p>A body</p><p></p><p>The corpse emitting a faint golden light lay flat in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>Under the glow of the golden light, the facial features were indiscernible.</p><p></p><p>However, the sacred aura it exuded made Ou Daozi feel both reverence and greed.</p><p></p><p>After hearing Ou Daozi's conclusion, Li Fan nodded with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>This forged immortal's remnant body was his leverage to stir up the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>The corpse was purchased at a high price, the extremely well-preserved remains of a Hedao cultivator from thousands of years ago.</p><p></p><p>It was then meticulously crafted with golden primordial force essence, imbuing it with a power that transcended the mundane.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, to make the disguise even more realistic,</p><p></p><p>Li Fan extracted and placed within the corpse some of the abilities of the exotic treasures he had previously obtained from the fishing pool.</p><p></p><p>For example, once one approached the remains, all kinds of emotions in the cultivator's heart would be infinitely amplified, almost to the point of losing reason.</p><p></p><p>When someone touched the remains, the pure and mutated spiritual energy hidden within would madly pour into their body, instantly elevating their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>All of this was done to make it as authentic as possible.</p><p></p><p>"Even Changsheng Tian Zun would probably be interested in the legendary true immortal's remains, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Then let's make a big fuss about it."</p><p></p><p>In addition to these tangible benefits, Li Fan had also secretly made some arrangements on this so-called true immortal's remains.</p><p></p><p>He guaranteed that the person who finally got their hands on it would receive a big surprise.</p><p></p><p>With the power of the Faceless True Immortal's concealment, it prevented those cultivators skilled in deduction from calculating the origin of the corpse.</p><p></p><p>After the final perfecting work was done, two pitch-black puppets walked in and carried away the "true immortal's remains".</p><p></p><p>They went to carry out Li Fan's mission.</p><p></p><p>From appearance to disappearance, they were silent and soundless.</p><p></p><p>Even if Li Fan were not their commander, it would be difficult to detect their movements.</p><p></p><p>These two puppets were the gains of the ingenious scholars of the Tianji Realm in recent years.</p><p></p><p>As expected of the most talented group in the Tianji Realm, after unremitting research, although they still hadn't been able to figure out the essence of the power of darkness,</p><p></p><p>there was no obstacle to achieving a certain degree of application.</p><p></p><p>The black puppets perfectly combined the properties of the power of darkness.</p><p></p><p>They could disappear and appear from the "cracks" of the world, just like the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Divine sense could not lock onto or perceive them.</p><p></p><p>And they had a strong suppressive effect on spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary means of attack could hardly cause them any damage.</p><p></p><p>The only flaw was that the puppets had limited destructive power and could only carry out some covert lurking missions.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the nature of darkness being contrary to the immortal ruins also meant that these puppets could not go out to fight for long periods of time.</p><p></p><p>Every once in a while, they had to return to the dark realm to replenish the power of darkness.</p><p></p><p>In any case, Li Fan was quite satisfied with these black puppets.</p><p></p><p>Entrusting them with missions would hardly reveal any flaws.</p><p></p><p>After sending Ou Daozi away, Li Fan came alone to a sealed space.</p><p></p><p>Flashing on the light screen were one young face after another.</p><p></p><p>Appearing along with the images below was a long string of descriptions about their personalities.</p><p></p><p>"There are countless mortals in the small worlds, but it's still a bit difficult to find someone with a pure heart and utmost sincerity like Mr. Bai."</p><p></p><p>"Especially since the power of Wangsheng Tian Zun has already impacted many small worlds."</p><p></p><p>"In recent years, the number of newborns has clearly decreased a lot."</p><p></p><p>"No choice. We can only take a step back and settle for the next best thing."</p><p></p><p>"If innate qualities won't do, then we'll influence them through acquired education."</p>

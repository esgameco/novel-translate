        <h1>Chapter 1314</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"But how exactly should we go about doing it?" The Eminent Yin's piercing gaze pointed out the crux of the problem. </p><p></p><p>The cultivators present were actually of comparable strength.</p><p></p><p>The old methods of longevity cultivation could not help revive the starry seas, let alone reverse the crisis facing the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>It was like a bucket of cold water had been poured over them. Everyone quickly sobered up and looked towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sat calmly on the lecture platform, as if he had anticipated Yin's question, and answered unhurriedly, "Do you know that the world is like a person, and the starry seas are also the same?"</p><p></p><p>"If a person falls ill, then treat the symptoms with medicine, and follow up by stimulating the acupoints and meridians."</p><p></p><p>"When worlds and starry seas are beset by calamities, it can be handled similarly..."</p><p></p><p>A human figure diagram made of light slowly appeared before everyone, following Li Fan's words. The important acupoints and meridians were all marked out.</p><p></p><p>With a gentle wave of his hand, the light diagram suddenly transformed, expanding and diffusing until it became a faintly glowing yellow cloud mass. The acupoints and meridians within the human body had also evolved according to the patterns and were now distributed across the cloud mass.</p><p></p><p>The group had just returned from the outer starry void of Xuanhuang, so how could they not recognize that this cloud represented the Xuanhuang realm? As they were observing intently, they saw Li Fan point again.</p><p></p><p>The cloud mass expanded once more, a thousand-fold, ten thousand-fold.</p><p></p><p>The brilliant scene instantly engulfed and immersed everyone.</p><p></p><p>It was a dazzling expanse of starry seas.</p><p></p><p>They vaguely sensed that the occasional flashes and emanations of different light from within the starry seas corresponded precisely to the acupoints and meridians from the previous human and world diagrams!</p><p></p><p>"From the human to the realm, from the realm to the domain. It should be so!" The Eminent Yin seemed deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>The others also appeared to have gained some profound insight.</p><p></p><p>As they wanted to examine further, Li Fan waved his hand and the starry seas instantly reverted, transforming back into the scenery of the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>"To restore the starry seas first, we must restore Xuanhuang. To restore Xuanhuang, we must start from these locations." </p><p></p><p>On the miniaturized scene of the Xuanhuang realm, Li Fan marked out various locations.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang realm has been devoured and plundered by cultivators for thousands of years, so it should have been completely depleted long ago. Fortunately, the Celestial Master of Dharma Transmission has been continuously collecting world fragments from the starry seas to nourish it. These remnant realms are like medicine, and although Xuanhuang has consumed them, it has not fully absorbed them yet..."</p><p></p><p>Those scattered markings emitted a lush, crystalline glow, as if containing boundless vitality and energy.</p><p></p><p>From Li Fan's exposition, everyone had already understood his meaning.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, one sentence: Help Xuanhuang digest the medicinal properties!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued, "Xuanhuang has been weak for a long time, so there is a risk it cannot accept further supplementation. Thus, we need to guide and induce it, using the acupoints to lead the meridians, the points to connect to the planes..."</p><p></p><p>The lecture lasted a full seven days and nights.</p><p></p><p>Even after Li Fan's image dissipated, everyone remained immersed in his explication of the unity of humanity, heaven, and medicine, deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>It was the Eminent Yin who recovered his senses first: "The remnant realms as medicine, this metaphor is truly ingenious. Absorption, digestion, assimilation into one's own body. And those that cannot be absorbed will be completely expelled. This is called the dregs of medicine..."</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong responded absentmindedly before taking his leave.</p><p></p><p>Baixia's brow furrowed slightly: "Inducing Xuanhuang to digest the remnant realm forces is no easy task. The Xuanhuang cultivators have opposed the Heavenly Dao for so many years, any actions involving remnant realm powers could provoke hostility from the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, even if we do it for its own good."</p><p></p><p>As they departed, Li Fan said he would help resolve this issue before lecturing again.</p><p></p><p>It's just unknown what method he will adopt.</p><p></p><p>As a remnant realm ghost, the Eminent Yin was far more aware than other cultivators of just how difficult it was to dissolve the malice of the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later, when Li Fan reappeared, he invited everyone to the airspace above the Minor World of Great Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Upon arriving here, the Eminent Yin felt as if he had sunk into a quagmire, facing immense resistance with every movement. His ghost nature from the remnant realms was of no help in resolving this obstructive force. He could not even discern the source of this inexplicable resistance.</p><p></p><p>Baixia and Qiao Gong also had extremely grave expressions, indicating they had sensed the abnormality of this place.</p><p></p><p>"Allow me to introduce someone to you all," Li Fan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>An old man with a hunched back and white hair then appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>The old man's strength was not particularly impressive, but it was the coffin he carried on his back that drew everyone's attention.</p><p></p><p>The resentful aura emanating from the coffin caused Yin and the others to squint.</p><p></p><p>"This is Daoist Friend Xu Ke, a former disciple of the Beast Taming School. Due to a certain mission, he has been secluded in meditation in this minor world for thousands of years..." After briefly introducing Xu Ke's background, Li Fan gestured for him to take the coffin off his back.</p><p></p><p>It hovered in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>As if sensing its guardian's temporary departure, the seal on the coffin immediately became more agitated. The coffin boards shook incessantly, as if whatever was sealed inside was about to break free at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what is sealed within this coffin?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for a response, he directly revealed the answer: "It is a strand of the Xuanhuang will."</p><p></p><p>"However, this strand of will has already been filled with resentment, madness, and obsession. It has transformed into the purest manifestation of the Xuanhuang malice!"</p><p></p><p>"Today, we are going to purify this malicious will, and then return it to Xuanhuang!" Li Fan declared solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke coughed lightly and added, "When this malice separated from the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao back then, it already intended to completely sever itself. To the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao, it was not just a case of losing a piece of flesh, but more akin to a severed spiritual body."</p><p></p><p>"If we can return it to the Heavenly Dao and restore that missing part, it will definitely induce the Xuanhuang celestial blessing..."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the prerequisite is truly purifying all the malice within." Xu Ke looked at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan seemed very confident: "It's just some malicious will after all. With all of us joining forces, how could we fail to purify it?"</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong had been listening for a while, and after learning the true identity of what was sealed in the coffin, he became rather impatient: "Specifically, how do we go about doing it? I will definitely cooperate fully!"</p><p></p><p>"What it resents is simply not having left back then. If so, then we shall fulfill its wish and let it cross that high wall from back then!" As Li Fan spoke, a duster appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>He raised it high, then swept it down forcefully towards the coffin.</p><p></p><p>The violently shaking coffin leapt up, then froze rigid in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>Silvery light shone from the white silk duster, dreamlike scenes flickering within the radiance.</p><p></p><p>They were illusion scenes imbued by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Although each illusion was different, they all depicted, without exception, scenes of great terror and apocalypse beyond the high wall.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang malicious will, attached to the white-haired elder, successfully crossed the high wall and escaped into the dark starry seas.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Afterward.</p><p></p><p>Every time, he was unable to survive for more than three breaths before dying from all kinds of indescribable unknown calamities. </p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Yellow Primordial Evil Thought had experienced tens of thousands of deaths in the illusion realm.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qiao Gong muttered to himself: "Isn't this a bit too absurd? The unknown outside the high walls may be uncertain, but it can't be like this, can it? Even an ordinary-looking cat could swallow Him in one bite? This Yellow Primordial Evil Thought, in terms of strength, is probably not much weaker than the Ancient Immortal Cultivation Method. Can He really be deceived?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke, who had been with the Yellow Primordial Evil Thought for thousands of years, keenly sensed that the struggle coming from inside the coffin had indeed become slightly weaker, and he couldn't help but show a pleased expression: "It's really working!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan's voice also came from above: "Everyone can also help depict the dream realm. No matter how bizarre or terrifying, it doesn't matter, as long as the Yellow Primordial Evil Thought is ultimately eliminated."</p><p></p><p>The dustpan light surged, swelling in front of everyone. At the end of the broomstick handle, a vortex faintly appeared.</p><p></p><p>With spiritual understanding, Yin Shangren and the others projected the most terrifying dream realms they could imagine into it with their thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the dream realm depicted by Yin Shangren was especially bizarre and terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Even with Li Fan's current experience, observing it made him feel a shudder of horror.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, the illusion dreams woven by Qiao Gong, Bai Hua, and Xu Ke were much more ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong's dream realm often involved the destruction of the world, transforming into puppets, and the inability to distinguish reality from illusion.</p><p></p><p>Bai Hua's dream realm was related to the withering of life and the freezing silence that enveloped all things.</p><p></p><p>Under the alternating baptism of these terrifying dream realms, the Yellow Primordial Evil Thought had already undergone a qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>"The outside of the high walls is so terrifying?"</p><p></p><p>"I should never have left the high walls in the first place. Even if I could only live a wretched existence, it's better than losing my life in an instant!"</p><p></p><p>Thoughts like these accumulated in the Yellow Primordial Evil Thought with the end of each dream realm.</p><p></p><p>Although each time it seemed almost negligible, the speed at which the dream realms were derived and reincarnated was too fast.</p><p></p><p>Every moment, there were tens of millions of dream realms disappearing and occurring.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, these dream realms were not just ordinary dreams, but top-level illusion formations imbued with a touch of Li Fan's "the false is also true" enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Watching his masterpiece, Li Fan couldn't help but feel a sense of pride: "Transformed from the Cloud and Water Illusion Dream Technique, but the effect is much stronger than the original."</p><p></p><p>"It also incorporates illusion formation amplification... Even though it's not a celestial formation, it surpasses celestial formations."</p><p></p><p>As the dream realms continued to stack up, the speed of the Yellow Primordial Evil Thought's descent also accelerated.</p><p></p><p>Initially, there would still occasionally be emotions of doubt and resistance.</p><p></p><p>But later, all questions disappeared.</p><p></p><p>All that remained was endless regret and fear.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Yellow Primordial Evil Thought trembling in the formation, Li Fan knew it was time to serve this dish.</p><p></p><p>"Rise!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stretched out his hand, grasping the giant dustpan in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>He then stirred it slightly.</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of silver-white dustpan threads also stirred ceaselessly inside the coffin.</p><p></p><p>Like countless blades, they cut the Yellow Primordial Evil Thought, which had already completely given up resistance, into countless tiny pieces.</p><p></p><p>The sealed coffin also became illusory as the evil thought disintegrated.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan waved the dustpan lightly, and some of the threads rolled up one part of the dismembered Yellow Primordial Evil Thought and brought it before Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, please!" Yin Shangren first bowed to express his gratitude to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Then he solemnly received the divided Yellow Primordial Evil Thought before him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then divided another portion and sent it to Qiao Gong.</p><p></p><p>Like carving up a pig, it didn't take long for Li Fan to complete the division of the Yellow Primordial Evil Thought.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present got a share.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan himself even got a bit more than the others.</p><p></p><p>However, Yin Shangren and the others naturally had no objection to this.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>Manipulating the giant dustpan, Li Fan threw it towards the sky with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>It tore through the azure sky, opening a passage to the Yellow Primordial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chanted spells.</p><p></p><p>Without Li Fan's excessive operation, from the moment the passage was opened, the consciousness of the Yellow Primordial Realm had already noticed the existence of the divided thought that had originally come from itself.</p><p></p><p>A tremendous roar echoed through the passage, as if the consciousness of the Yellow Primordial Realm was about to descend.</p><p></p><p>"The soul returns!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pointed into the air.</p><p></p><p>The purified and divided portion of the Yellow Primordial Evil Thought before him flew towards the passage.</p><p></p><p>Its speed accelerated until it disappeared from everyone's sight in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Next, Yin Shangren and the others followed suit.</p><p></p><p>In a short while, the scattered Yellow Primordial Evil Thought that had been lost for years finally returned to the Yellow Primordial Realm.</p><p></p><p>The passage closed, and all abnormal phenomena disappeared completely.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the sealed coffin completely dissipate and vanish, Xu Ke felt a sense of melancholy loss.</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong, on the other hand, was a bit worried: "Is that it? I hope we didn't waste our efforts."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly: "Rest assured. The Yellow Primordial Realm will not be ungrateful to those who have contributed."</p><p></p><p>"However, we need to give the Yellow Primordial Realm some time to digest it. Before the harvest, everyone just needs to wait patiently."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's figure faded along with these words, leaving the others with varying expressions.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren turned to Xu Ke and inquired about Mr. Bai's matters.</p><p></p><p>The previously bewildered Xu Ke immediately became energized.</p><p></p><p>The two conversed happily, feeling an instant connection.</p><p></p><p>Bai Hua and Qiao Gong, on the other hand, seemed a bit awkward with each other and went their separate ways.</p><p></p><p>They were all waiting for the reward from the Yellow Primordial Realm that Li Fan had mentioned.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Yellow Primordial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's main body concealed his tracks and secretly observed the changes in the Yellow Primordial Realm.</p><p></p><p>If absorbing the spiritual energy of immortals caused changes on the surface of the mountains and rivers in the Yellow Primordial Realm, then absorbing its own lost thoughts caused silent changes within the inner world.</p><p></p><p>Only cultivators extremely familiar with the operations of the Yellow Primordial Realm's laws could perceive it.</p><p></p><p>"Analogous to us cultivators, it's like strengthening the soul and spiritual consciousness."</p><p></p><p>"The first beneficiaries should be the laws of the Yellow Primordial Realm, which is the immortal cultivation of the Yellow Primordial Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sensed a few enormous consciousnesses sweeping by in the realm.</p><p></p><p>Some of them were quite familiar.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, let me give you a taste first. In the end, you'll all have to spit it out for me!"</p><p></p><p>The enormous consciousnesses searched for a while but failed to find the reason for the inexplicable changes in the Yellow Primordial Realm.</p><p></p><p>They could only give up.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan inwardly sneered, ignoring them.</p><p></p><p>He continued to carefully comprehend the changes in the Yellow Primordial Realm.</p>

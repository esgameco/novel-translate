        <h1>Chapter 625</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Until the silver dragon revealed its true form, it was a silver long spear.</p><p></p><p>It was slowly explained in the viewing mirror.</p><p></p><p>"The spear is like a dragon, nothing can withstand it."</p><p></p><p>After piercing through Xu Guzhi's body, the silver long spear suddenly turned back, piercing through the endless sword shadows one by one.</p><p></p><p>And then slowly returned to Di Luwu's hands.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the mountainous giant swords wielded by Xu Guzhi still did not touch Di Luwu's body.</p><p></p><p>They disappeared faintly in the display of silver light.</p><p></p><p>Xu Guzhi suddenly spit out a mouthful of blood, unbelievably looking at the "child" in front of him who showed no emotional fluctuations at all.</p><p></p><p>The turning point of the battle occurred in an instant.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the vast majority of the spectator cultivators underneath the sky did not see clearly what had just happened.</p><p></p><p>It was only through the slow playback on the viewing mirror that they understood the details of the battle.</p><p></p><p>And so, they gasped in amazement.</p><p></p><p>"Such speed! Such sharp spear technique!"</p><p></p><p>"Just who is this Di Luwu, he is too strong! I think even some Supreme Dao Ancestors may not be his match!"</p><p></p><p>"Friend, who are you referring to, please speak openly."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As Xu Guzhi, who was pierced by the silver spear, did not immediately admit defeat.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath, and his body wounds were healed completely.</p><p></p><p>Xu Guzhi slightly opened his mouth, swallowing the straight sword in his hand into his abdomen.</p><p></p><p>The sword entered the body, and the body disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Xu Guzhi disappeared so openly and disappeared in full view of everyone!</p><p></p><p>It was the explanation that appeared in the viewing mirror that made the cultivators understand what had happened.</p><p></p><p>"The sword returns to the sheath, killing disappears in emptiness."</p><p></p><p>For the first time, a slight emotion appeared on Di Luwu's face.</p><p></p><p>But it was merely a fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>He stood still in the void, extended his right hand forward provocatively.</p><p></p><p>Almost in the next moment, an invisible sword light suddenly appeared not far above Di Luwu's head.</p><p></p><p>Silently, as it was about to behead Di Luwu.</p><p></p><p>The silver light rushed up to meet the "Return to Sheath Sword," intercepting the killing move instantly.</p><p></p><p>Di Luwu scanned his surroundings but still couldn't find Xu Guzhi's trace.</p><p></p><p>Another invisible sword energy struck, imperceptible to people.</p><p></p><p>Yet, just before it was about to touch Di Luwu's body, it was intercepted by his silver spear.</p><p></p><p>"Although the sword is invisible, the intention moves without a heart."</p><p></p><p>"The spear of martial arts, at the utmost speed, breaks all techniques."</p><p></p><p>The explanation on the viewing mirror appeared again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared at these two lines of words in the small mirror for a long time, recalling the battle between Xu Guzhi and Di Luwu, seemingly understanding something.</p><p></p><p>Xu Guzhi's Return to Sheath Sword was indeed extraordinary; even Di Luwu couldn't detect its trace.</p><p></p><p>However, Di Luwu's speed was truly too fast, far surpassing Xu Guzhi.</p><p></p><p>Di Luwu had mastered the art of moving without conscious intention, thus, at the moment he was about to be attacked, he manipulated the silver long spear to intercept all the Return to Sheath Swords one by one.</p><p></p><p>Looking at it this way, it was definitely an impossible task for Xu Guzhi to defeat Di Luwu.</p><p></p><p>But for Di Luwu to defeat Xu Guzhi...</p><p></p><p>It seemed equally difficult.</p><p></p><p>Di Luwu seemed fed up with the mockery, furrowing his brows for the first time.</p><p></p><p>A violent silver light surged from him, sweeping around, vowing to destroy everything in its path.</p><p></p><p>The scene in the viewing mirror was completely engulfed by the silver brilliance.</p><p></p><p>After a brief blindness, the scene gradually returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>"With this, Xu Guzhi should have died."</p><p></p><p>Just as many cultivators thought this, another invisible sword light, seemingly lingering like a ghost, slashed towards Di Luwu.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan's eyes lit up: "Using this method to save one's life is truly clever."</p><p></p><p>Di Luwu was clearly irritated by Xu Guzhi's despicable tactics.</p><p></p><p>The silver lightning snakes continued to sweep through the surrounding space, even creating black void cracks.</p><p></p><p>Yet, he still couldn't find Xu Guzhi.</p><p></p><p>In the spectator seat of Wanxian League, murmurs and mocking sounds could be heard.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of competition is this? Can't win, so you hide?"</p><p></p><p>"I think we should stop calling Xu Guzhi and change his name to Xu Turtle!"</p><p></p><p>Regardless of how others criticized, Xu Guzhi remained unmoved, hidden in the void.</p><p></p><p>One sword after another relentlessly attacked Di Luwu.</p><p></p><p>It seemed this battle might go on forever without a conclusion, but in the end, through the friendly negotiations between both sides.</p><p></p><p>A dramatic result occurred.</p><p></p><p>The first match of the first day ended in a tie!</p><p></p><p>This result was totally unexpected for everyone.</p><p></p><p>Only in the Tianxuan Mirror [Law Derivation World] section, a cultivator posted a message.</p><p></p><p>"I can't believe it's a tie, 300 times the odds? This time I've really turned my luck around!"</p><p></p><p>This caused envy and mockery from countless cultivators.</p><p></p><p>After Xu Guzhi and Di Luwu finished, they rested for a moment, and the second match began.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recognized the cultivator sent by Wanxian League, who went by the nickname "I Am Invincible," as Shaofeng.</p><p></p><p>On the other side representing the Wulao Association was a seemingly unremarkable disabled person.</p><p></p><p>This "Lame Daoist" may look ordinary but was actually extremely strong in combat.</p><p></p><p>Every move and gesture seemed to contain immense power. Even the space seemed distorted, causing the live broadcast images on the viewing mirror to appear blurry.</p><p></p><p>But Shaofeng was not easy to deal with and managed to block all of Lame Daoist's attacks with his dazzling armor.</p><p></p><p>After a long battle between the two, Shaofeng eventually seized the opportunity and used his forty-nine flying swords to defeat the Lame Daoist.</p><p></p><p>The second match ended with a victory for Wanxian League.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly dissatisfied with his victory.</p><p></p><p>"Shaofeng's victory lies in the effectiveness of tools, not bravery in combat."</p><p></p><p>Even the viewing mirror displayed a post-match commentary like that.</p><p></p><p>In theory, such acts of long others' prestige and diminish one's own should not happen.</p><p></p><p>However, it did happen.</p><p></p><p>"Who is Shaofeng?"</p><p></p><p>"His magical treasures are amazing! If I had this set of equipment, I probably wouldn't be much weaker, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Just you? People have good parents, what about you? You're daydreaming!"</p><p></p><p>"Good parents? Friend, elaborate."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Cultivators around the world were talking non-stop, knowing that Shaofeng was the son of the Scarlet Snow Immortal Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps his ability to participate in this competition was not unrelated to his mother.</p><p></p><p>No matter what Shaofeng himself thought, in the midst of such fervent discussions, the third match began.</p><p></p><p>Expected to be another intense battle, the result of the competition was surprisingly swift.</p><p></p><p>In just one fist, the representative of Wanxian League was defeated.</p><p></p><p>And the one who struck the fist was a seemingly ordinary peasant woman from the Wulao Association.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1175</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Before, Li Fan had always been puzzled by the countless corpses in the "Reverse Life and Death Formation".</p><p></p><p>There were too many inexplicable things.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, the number was simply too large. Secondly...</p><p></p><p>The preservation state of all the corpses was relatively intact.</p><p></p><p>They didn't seem like remains left behind when the great calamity descended and the world was destroyed.</p><p></p><p>"Originally, I had guessed that the Rebirth Venerable might also be an alias of the Celestial Doctor. Now it seems..."</p><p></p><p>Recalling the horror of that formless monster just now, Li Fan couldn't help but question his own judgment.</p><p></p><p>"What's the connection between that monster and the Rebirth Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had seen the Rebirth Venerable before.</p><p></p><p>In the 119th world, with a body of white mist, he suddenly appeared and instantly killed three Dharma Transmitters.</p><p></p><p>But afterwards, the Dharma Transmission Venerable intervened, and the matter was left unresolved.</p><p></p><p>"Dharma Transmission, Celestial Doctor, Rebirth. There must be some connection between these three."</p><p></p><p>"But that formless monster just now..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless thoughts flashed through the mind of the Holy Fetus Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li, to be safe, let's leave here first." Shao Jun's words interrupted his musings.</p><p></p><p>The two followed the path they came from and returned to the Yin-Yang Pearl again.</p><p></p><p>Only this time, they directly appeared on the Sea of Life, opposite to the Sea of Silent Death.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the winds on the ocean all blew towards the exit of the maze realm.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... a gesture of sending off guests?"</p><p></p><p>The two looked at each other, both startled in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, they didn't dare to linger here any longer and could only leave sheepishly through the exit.</p><p></p><p>"Phew." Leaving the Life and Death Maze Realm and returning to the white mist, Shao Jun didn't feel the relief of surviving a disaster.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he became a bit dispirited: "There are too many hidden secrets in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The formless existence we encountered this time must have a strength not inferior to that mysterious person who transformed the world. Even if the Venerable returns, can he really cleanse everything..."</p><p></p><p>Having witnessed too many things beyond his cognition in a short time, Shao Jun suddenly became somewhat lost.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan immediately changed the subject: "What do you think about that formless existence, Shao Jun?"</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't seem like a cultivator. Otherwise, it wouldn't have ignored us. Rather, it's like something executing a fixed task..."</p><p></p><p>"A monster?" Shao Jun squeezed out this descriptive term after a long time.</p><p></p><p>"But even if it's a monster, it's an existence that can absolutely crush us." He mocked himself, "I've presided over the Chizha Abyss for hundreds of years, perfected my divine techniques, and prided myself on having few rivals under the immortals in the Xuanhuang Realm. Who would have thought that after following Brother Li out to travel for just a year or so, I would witness so many terrifying and formidable existences. Only now do I realize how narrow-minded I was before."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan consoled: "It's not that Shao Jun is not strong. It's that these old monsters are hidden too deeply."</p><p></p><p>"No, no. There's a saying that when a nation is about to perish, there will be strange omens. The more chaos emerges, the more it shows that the Xuanhuang Realm is already critically ill." After being downcast for a while, Shao Jun suddenly became impassioned again.</p><p></p><p>"However, with the strength of just the two of us, it's a bit difficult to change all this."</p><p></p><p>"We need help." Shao Jun said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"I had this intention originally. However, those who can be trusted and have the capability, it's hard to..." The Holy Fetus Li Fan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Shao Jun's eyes burned as he looked outside the white mist: "I have..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"There are a few candidates in mind."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go. We should return first. During this period of traveling, we have at least obtained some evidence. We have at least a 70% chance of convincing them."</p><p></p><p>While flying through the white mist, Shang Shaojun introduced to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"The first one is Jinglun. I wonder if Brother Li has heard of this person?"</p><p></p><p>"Although this person's cultivation is only at the Huashen realm, his overall strength is definitely not inferior to mine. He is proficient in all laws and martial arts, and possesses a wealth of knowledge. He is truly a top-notch genius in the Xuanhuang realm. More importantly, he is absolutely loyal to the Wanxian Alliance! If we can convince him to join us, there might even be additional surprises."</p><p></p><p>"There is another person named Ji Hongdao. He is a rare genius in array formations. If not for his weak background and seniority, I believe he could have contended for the position of the chief of the Wanxian Alliance's Strategy Hall! In addition to array formations, he is also proficient in the art of refining artifacts..."</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun went on and on, listing one name after another.</p><p></p><p>All of them were people Li Fan was familiar with.</p><p></p><p>"Well, there is actually one more person who might be worth considering. However..." Shang Shaojun hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"But this person's background is not simple. There are too many entanglements behind him. Bringing him in might not be a good thing."</p><p></p><p>Without keeping him in suspense, Shang Shaojun continued, "Although he looks like just a mischievous boy, he is frighteningly strong in actual combat. Even for someone like me at the Hedao realm, I might not be able to force out his full strength. But his mind is not very clear. As long as he sees someone, he wants to pull them into a contest..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan instantly understood who Shang Shaojun was talking about.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts fanatic child, suspected to be the reincarnation of Senior Brother Zhang Qianmo.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had once used the high authority of the Tianxuan Mirror's origin to search for information about this martial arts fanatic child.</p><p></p><p>The Wanxian Alliance's internal judgment was that he was the embodiment of the world's spirit, born as a human.</p><p></p><p>Although he had a human body, his behavior, residence, and way of thinking were not like that of a human.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he was more like a rule embodiment of the world's spirit.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts fanatic child was not invincible, but his learning ability was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Any moves used against him during a fight would be immediately learned by him.</p><p></p><p>The Wanxian Alliance had also tried to capture him for careful study.</p><p></p><p>When he reappeared, he was already thousands of miles away.</p><p></p><p>And he had no memory of being captured before.</p><p></p><p>The Alliance even sent several Hedao cultivators to join hands and kill him.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts fanatic child's body was completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>But not long after, he appeared alive in the world again.</p><p></p><p>And he had even learned some of the divine powers of those Hedao cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Faced with such a troublesome existence, considering that he only quietly sought people to spar with and did not do anything to endanger the safety of the Wanxian Alliance, the headquarters of the Alliance decided to only strictly monitor him and not interfere with him anymore.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan speculated that the reason for the martial arts fanatic child's unusual abilities might be related to Senior Brother Zhang's Hongyan Fashen (Vow Dharma Body).</p><p></p><p>The Hongyan Fashen merged with heaven and earth, almost equivalent to a part of the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Mistaking him for the embodiment of the world's spirit was not surprising.</p><p></p><p>As for whether the martial arts fanatic child had anything to do with Senior Brother Zhang...</p><p></p><p>Those two extremely similar faces explained everything.</p><p></p><p>"Shaojun, there's no need to worry too much. We should welcome anyone who comes and the more the better. After all, if what we are going to do doesn't succeed..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid the Wanxian Alliance will no longer have a place for us in the future," said the Sacred Fetus Li Fan with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun was slightly stunned at first, and then nodded.</p>

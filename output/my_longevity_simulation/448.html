        <div class="content">
            <p>"What is this about?" Chen Ying couldn't believe he was surprised by this ancient Tianji sect cultivator the first time they met, and asked in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't answer immediately. Instead, his expression became serious as he closed his eyes and began calculating by pinching his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chen Ying stood aside, not daring to interrupt.</p><p></p><p>The deduction continued for the time it takes an incense stick to burn.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's breath became uneven, and his face grew paler.</p><p></p><p>This made Chen Ying nervous as well.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Fan opened his eyes and coughed up a mouthful of blood.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Li Fan, are you alright?" Chen Ying was shocked and about to check on him.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, just suffered some backlash." Li Fan wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Before Chen Ying could react, Li Fan stared at him intently and asked, "Friend Chen, are you planning to go on a long journey recently?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Ying was first startled, then suddenly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, he had received an order from headquarters to go to a newly discovered Wood-attribute blessed land.</p><p></p><p>However, he hadn't mentioned this to anyone yet, so how did Li Fan know?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he really saw something through divination?</p><p></p><p>Chen Ying quickly took out a Vitality-Preserving Pill and handed it to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, please take this pill to alleviate your injuries."</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan swallowed it and his complexion improved, Chen Ying asked solemnly, "Indeed, I do have to leave the Cloud Sea soon due to some reasons."</p><p></p><p>"Is the disaster you mentioned related to this journey?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slowly, "It's better to return early. The longer you stay outside, the more dangerous it becomes."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chen Ying's heart sank halfway.</p><p></p><p>If this mission took longer than a year or so, he would likely never return.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't that mean, as long as he goes, it's likely to end in disaster?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chen Ying couldn't help but have the thought of defying orders.</p><p></p><p>But it was just a fleeting thought.</p><p></p><p>The order from the headquarters of the Ten Thousand Immortals League was not something a small nascent soul cultivator like him could refuse.</p><p></p><p>Nowhere to escape, at a dead end?</p><p></p><p>No wonder he had been feeling restless recently, but couldn't pinpoint the reason.</p><p></p><p>It turned out to be related to this!</p><p></p><p>Chen Ying's face instantly became extremely ugly.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, he looked at Li Fan beside him and made a decision.</p><p></p><p>"I can't avoid this trip. Please help me, friend!" Chen Ying said hopefully.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed faintly, "Knowing the heavens is easy, but defying fate is difficult. I can barely foresee future mysteries. To change fate against the heavens, this..."</p><p></p><p>"Friend, you really put me in a dilemma."</p><p></p><p>"However, I can offer you some advice."</p><p></p><p>"Only do what is humanly possible, without guaranteeing absolute efficacy."</p><p></p><p>Just when Chen Ying was extremely disappointed, Li Fan's words suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, please speak!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan first assessed Chen Ying, then asked, "Forgive my intrusion, but may I ask, if it comes down to a life-and-death struggle, what is your level of strength?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Ying looked embarrassed at the question, "They say one should specialize in their own field. Alchemy, nurturing creatures... I'm good at those. Fighting..."</p><p></p><p>Chen Ying shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then inquired further, "If you were to be ambushed, how well can you protect yourself? Do you have preparations for defense, concealment, escape techniques in place?"</p><p></p><p>"The Ten Thousand Immortals League has been in peace for too long, and I have always been kind to others. I never felt the need for these things..." Chen Ying answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed, "That is it! You completely lack vigilance. If calamity strikes suddenly without any defense, you will naturally fall easily."</p><p></p><p>"Since this calamity cannot be avoided, you can only resist it."</p><p></p><p>"I see that you have purchased such a blessed land on the Wanxian Island with your wealth. At present, the only way is to spend money to avoid disaster!"</p><p></p><p>"In the Tianxuan Mirror, there are many defense treasures and techniques. Friend, do not be stingy, purchase and strengthen yourself as much as possible."</p><p></p><p>"If you can withstand the attacks of fusion-stage cultivators for a moment, perhaps you will find a glimmer of hope."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan explained.</p><p></p><p>With the contribution points he had accumulated over the years, if he were to empty his family fortune, he might indeed be able to buy one or two treasures that could withstand the attacks of fusion-stage cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But those were prepared for exchanging fusion-stage cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>If the calamities Li Fan mentioned did not occur, it would mean he wasted so many contribution points for nothing.</p><p></p><p>He would have to start accumulating from scratch.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't it a bit..." Chen Ying couldn't help but ask, but Li Fan subtly shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I've said enough. Whether you believe it or not is no longer my concern!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Chen Ying quickly stopped him.</p><p></p><p>"You came in a hurry, but can't leave in a hurry, can you? I will repay the favor of saving my life in the future. For now, let me fulfill the duties of a host!" Suppressing various thoughts in his heart, Chen Ying showed Li Fan around his blessed land.</p><p></p><p>After introducing the unique methods of cultivating spirit plants, Chen Ying personally refined a furnace of medicinal pills in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Through their conversation, Chen Ying discovered that this person was indeed an ancient cultivator.</p><p></p><p>His knowledge was profound, though not in alchemy.</p><p></p><p>He effortlessly cited various pharmacological knowledge, even offering insights that benefited Chen Ying greatly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stayed in Chen Ying's blessed land for seven days, finally bidding farewell to Chen Ying's reluctance.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Chen Ying generously gave Li Fan a bottle of Enlightenment Pill.</p><p></p><p>This pill was refined by his unique method and could be used during a breakthrough to the Nascent Soul realm, with remarkable effects.</p><p></p><p>The materials were rare and the chances of successful refinement were extremely low.</p><p></p><p>Chen Ying himself didn't have much stock, and it was not usually sold but given as gifts in special circumstances.</p><p></p><p>This gesture was also a way for Chen Ying to repay Li Fan for noticing that his cultivation had returned to the late Golden Core stage and he was about to reforge his Nascent Soul.</p><p></p><p>"This person is not someone who deceives with mysteries but has genuine talent and knowledge."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan off, Chen Ying pondered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"The disaster of the blood light..."</p><p></p><p>"Just a few contribution points. If lost, I can earn more. At most, it'll be a bit harder, make more pills."</p><p></p><p>"If I die, everything will be over."</p><p></p><p>"Better to believe in it than not."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Chen Ying made a firm decision.</p><p></p><p>He opened the Tianxuan Mirror in his blessed land and began searching through it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if Chen Ying can escape this disaster."</p><p></p><p>Leaving the blessed land, with many barriers blocking the way, Li Fan lost the specific sense of Chen Ying's existence.</p><p></p><p>He could only vaguely feel his presence.</p><p></p><p>"It all depends on his own destiny."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stopped thinking too much and left the residential area on Wanxian Island, returning to the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"If I hadn't known that the entire Cloud Sea would disappear soon, I would have bought a blessed land too."</p><p></p><p>Feeling the slightly cramped space in the Tianxuan Mirror, Li Fan couldn't help but have this thought.</p>

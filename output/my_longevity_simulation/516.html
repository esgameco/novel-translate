        <h1>Chapter 516</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"The 'Nine Turns of True Wisdom in Dongxu Cave' is the cultivation method he practiced after advancing to the god transformation realm. </p><p></p><p>Although its power cannot compare to the 'Heavenly Path Scripture,' it is still quite remarkable. </p><p></p><p>Directly pointing to the realm of longevity, it can be called the supreme technique. </p><p></p><p>In the Dongxu Nine Turns, each turn involves penetrating through oneself and gaining insight into one's own unique divine skill. Placed in any other sect, it would be considered a treasure of profound teachings. </p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, only the elders and a few core disciples within the sect are qualified to practice it. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan was able to obtain the opportunity to practice this cultivation method by benefiting from Zhao Sister's promotion to Daoist. </p><p></p><p>However, at this moment...</p><p></p><p>After several cycles of the cultivation technique, not only did his cultivation not increase, but he also faintly sensed the positions of several fellow disciples who were also cultivating the 'Nine Turns of True Wisdom in Dongxu Cave.' The more he concentrated, the more an uncontrollable sense of killing intent surged in his heart. </p><p></p><p>"What on earth is happening?!" Li Fan was shocked and afraid, his face instantly turning extremely unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>"Not cultivating the same technique... This is the backlash of heaven and earth..." Zhao Sister looked up at the sky, murmuring to herself. "I never expected that the calamity I foresaw would actually arrive in this way."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan heard these words and felt a sense of panic. Upon a little contemplation, he seemed to see the imminent, unstoppable bloodshed in the world of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Since embarking on the path of cultivation, he had never felt such deep-seated fear like he did at this moment. However, now he was already a god transformation cultivator, and he was considered a prominent figure even outside the sect.</p><p></p><p>Although shocked but not confused, pacing back and forth in the room, Li Fan furrowed his brows and began pondering.</p><p></p><p>"'The Taxation of Heaven and Earth' can only be practiced by the two of us. Although its effectiveness has weakened a lot, it has not become completely ineffective."</p><p></p><p>"Does this mean that the more people who cultivate the same technique, the stronger the restrictions?"</p><p></p><p>"It’s almost predictable that this unexpected change will have a devastating impact on all sects in the world. With tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of disciples, where would there be so many cultivation methods for the disciples to practice!"</p><p></p><p>"Even the Eternal Immortal Alliance might not fare well, and it may even be worse off than us! After all, it is a recently established organization, unlike our Ten Daoist Sects with deep roots. The number of cultivation methods is limited, and it is said that the vast majority of their lower-level members practice the 'Heaven Shroud Divine Technique.'" A tinge of darkness flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This is a calamity for all of our cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan turned to look at Zhao Sister, hesitated for a moment, and then reminded, "Not cultivating the same technique will inevitably require some sacrifices. Sister, the 'Heavenly Path Scripture' you cultivate conflicts with the sect master..."</p><p></p><p>A hint of coldness also appeared on Zhao Sister's face.</p><p></p><p>Just as she was about to speak, a sudden and crisp sound of a bell ringing outside the house was heard.</p><p></p><p>"The sect master has called for an emergency meeting, probably to discuss how to deal with this calamity. I'll go first."</p><p></p><p>As her figure disappeared, her calm words finally reached Li Fan's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'll be careful."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked towards the sect's main hall on the mountaintop, his expression indescribable.</p><p></p><p>"Not cultivating the same technique..."</p><p></p><p>Alone in the room's secret chamber, Li Fan recalled the contents of several cultivation methods he had obtained in the remnants of the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the 'Taxation of Heaven and Earth,' there were also the 'My Eternal Technique,' 'Soul-Severing Illumination Technique,' and the 'Heavenly Grief Earth Mourning Scripture.'</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Zhao Sister had also studied these cultivation methods together in private.</p><p></p><p>However, the Xuantian Sect's cultivation methods, whether in cultivation methods or post-cultivation performance, were completely different from the current techniques. It was also likely that there were unknown imprints or restrictions similar to the dual cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>So, over the years, they had only memorized the originals without cultivating them.</p><p></p><p>"If forced, I can only switch to cultivating these unique and incomplete Xuantian Sect methods." Li Fan was well aware that he could never compare his status within the Great Dao Sect to those few core disciples. They were definitely the first to be abandoned. "Fortunately, the new technique allows for rapid cultivation. Even if I start over, I can quickly catch up."</p><p></p><p>"What is fated will happen; who would have thought that the encounters in youth would play such a decisive role after several years. With these unique methods, even amidst such a calamity, as long as I am cautious, I can safely pass through it." Li Fan's eyes flickered, his mind immersed in the contents of the cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>The highest-level meeting of the Great Dao Sect did not last long. Soon, the sect master Ji Changxi issued an edict to calm the disciples.</p><p></p><p>He instructed everyone not to panic, as the Ten Daoists of the Immortal Path had already begun devising countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, he ordered the recall of the sect's disciples outside and to open the sect's protective formation soon to seal the mountain gate.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the alchemy rooms were working at full capacity to refine longevity pills for emergencies.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As each order was issued, the panicked hearts of the disciples gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Path of the Ten Daoists had been passed down for a thousand years. They should be able to find a solution.</p><p></p><p>Most disciples thought so.</p><p></p><p>Three years passed in an extremely oppressive atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>Even though the cultivators made various attempts, they still had not found a solution to the 'Not Cultivating the Same Technique' issue.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, rumors from the outside world continued to spread about the numerous sects warring with each other to seize cultivation methods, resulting in the demise of countless sects.</p><p></p><p>The only good news was that the elusive Transmitter of Teachings suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>He forcefully entered the Supreme Sect and brought the cultivation section of the 'Primordial True Scripture of the Supreme Elders' for the cultivators of the world.</p><p></p><p>With this marvelous technique, even if forced to abandon their original techniques, they would not lose much of their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"I do feel a bit grateful to him." Li Fan activated the 'Soul-Severing Illumination Technique,' feeling his pure cultivation rapidly advancing in his dantian, couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, grateful to him? If it weren’t for him bringing about new practices, there wouldn't be this issue of the backlash of heaven and earth, the calamity descending upon us. Concealing evil intentions, such a heart should be eradicated!" Zhao Sister coldly snorted.</p><p></p><p>"According to the sect master, when he first began spreading the new practices, the Immortal Path of the Ten Daoists had already investigated this person thoroughly."</p><p></p><p>"It seems they failed to unearth anything unusual. "</p><p></p><p>"They were too arrogant at the time and didn't take this Transmitter of Teachings seriously. Also, there were other matters… "</p><p></p><p>"There were other matters to handle, so they neglected him."</p><p></p><p>"By the time they realized it, the new practices had spread like wildfire and were difficult to contain!"</p><p></p><p>"Unforgivable!"</p>

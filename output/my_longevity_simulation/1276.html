            <p>Chapter 1273: Yan Fajue's Hometown</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha..."</p><p></p><p>A trace of panic flashed through Yan Fajue's eyes as she thought about how to brush it off. </p><p></p><p>"Don't even think about muddling through. Confess honestly. Otherwise, I'll call for people! Discovering Yan Fajue's malicious plot, this must be a great merit. Maybe I can even be released early." Li Fan threatened with a smile that wasn't quite a smile.</p><p></p><p>"What malicious plot!" Yan Fajue glared at Li Fan angrily. </p><p></p><p>But outside the character light sphere, Li Fan's real self suddenly spoke up: "That..."</p><p></p><p>The gazes of the Guardians of the Dao, Zhang Xu and Hua Yueye, were instantly attracted over.</p><p></p><p>Little Loli Yan Fajue immediately panicked.</p><p></p><p>"Don't! Let's talk nicely!" She took a big step and rushed in front of the simulated personality, staring with wide, pitiful eyes at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, inside Yan Fajue's space, Li Fan's real self paused slightly before saying, "Fellow Daoists, I'd like to ask. For techniques derived by Yan Fajue like this, are they allowed to be spread externally? I know the Immortal Alliance rules prohibit external transmission. But..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xu said with a smile, "Could it be that Fellow Daoist Sun wants to seek a cultivation technique for your newborn son? Officially speaking, it's not allowed. However, those in charge of supervision are all our own people from the Protector Hall. So..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xu gave a knowing look. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan cupped his hands to indicate he understood.</p><p></p><p>Inside the character light sphere, hearing the conversation between the three Guardian Daoists, Yan Fajue finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"You bastard!" Yan Fajue's expression changed again as she tried to put on a fierce and vicious look.</p><p></p><p>"Speak. What exactly are you trying to do." The simulated personality stretched out his right hand, about to flick Yan Fajue's head with his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Yan Fajue instinctively dodged, but quickly realized the other party was just a simulated body without physical form. Embarrassed and angry, she glared.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan just showed that ambiguous smile again, making Yan Fajue deflate once more.</p><p></p><p>In the end, realizing she was no match for Li Fan, Yan Fajue admitted defeat.</p><p></p><p>"Fine, I can tell you. But you have to promise me first that you absolutely won't tattle to the Immortal Alliance!" Yan Fajue said very seriously, putting away the extra expressions on her face.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan just chuckled and retorted, "If I was of one heart with the Immortal Alliance, how could I have taken the opportunity of asking you to derive techniques to pass on this simulated personality method to you?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Fajue tilted her head to ponder for a moment, knowing what Li Fan said made sense.</p><p></p><p>Clapping her two chubby little hands together, the scene inside the character light sphere suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>Endless white jade bookshelves reaching to the sky, densely packed with all kinds of jade slips.</p><p></p><p>Each jade slip recorded a cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, the Celestial Venerate told me to exhaust all the techniques under heaven."</p><p></p><p>"I was too young at the time and thought with my abilities, it was just a small matter. So I happily agreed. Sigh, thinking back now, I was really muddled!" Yan Fajue sighed with the air of a world-weary elder.</p><p></p><p>"Can't finish deriving them! Simply can't finish deriving them all!"</p><p></p><p>"So many years have passed and I'm still far from reaching the goal! I feel like I'm reaching my limit!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Fajue scratched her hair, looking distressed.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? How to change that?" Li Fan looked around at the techniques with interest and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph. This young miss naturally has her brilliant plans!" Yan Fajue put her hands on her hips, looking very smug.</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, just give me fifty years of free time and I'll find a way to completely escape this bitter sea early! When the time comes, I'll definitely have a good long sleep."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't probe further, just repeating the number: "Fifty years."</p><p></p><p>"Then with this simulated personality helping you now, how long will you need to achieve your goal?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Fajue's big eyes rolled around as she lightly coughed. "I haven't tried it yet. How efficient is this thing exactly? Why don't you let me first..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>After a flash of light, it returned to the previous mechanical form.</p><p></p><p>"Master, how may I serve you?" The simulated personality asked very dutifully. </p><p></p><p>Yan Fajue waved her hand, issuing the command for it to take over the derivation work.</p><p></p><p>The giant character light sphere kept rotating as jade slips of techniques took form one after another, appearing on the white jade bookshelves.</p><p></p><p>Watching these jade slips appear, the joy of reaping without sowing instantly welled up in Yan Fajue's heart, making her grin foolishly nonstop.</p><p></p><p>Seven days passed in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's voice suddenly rang out again.</p><p></p><p>The moment he took back control of the simulated personality, the light sphere's technique derivation process was also interrupted.</p><p></p><p>"Phew..."</p><p>"Phew phew..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked over intently, only to see little loli Yan Fajue sprawled out in an undignified manner, floating in the air sound asleep.</p><p></p><p>"Mmm..." After Li Fan woke her, the little loli even rubbed her eyes hard.</p><p></p><p>She asked in a daze, "How many years have passed?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh? It's only been seven days!"</p><p></p><p>Soon after, when Yan Fajue saw the time clearly, she instantly woke up.</p><p></p><p>"That was a really good sleep." She smacked her lips, looking a bit reluctant.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you here again?" She then looked at Li Fan and said with much disdain.</p><p></p><p>Yan Fajue immediately deflated. "Alright, let me see. Mm, it's just a bit slower in efficiency compared to me going all out in derivation."</p><p></p><p>"Barely the same as the derivation speed I show in front of that group in the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly, "In other words, you'll be able to successfully escape after just another forty years?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Fajue was a bit baffled, "Escape? What escape?"</p><p></p><p>"I wanted to run away before because I didn't want to work. But now with such a good thing helping me work for free, why would I still run away? Isn't it great to rest every day."</p><p></p><p>Yan Fajue looked at Li Fan with contempt.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>"Then if I keep occupying the simulated personality, how will you deal with it?" Li Fan said lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, that won't stump me." Yan Fajue's figure suddenly retreated and the surroundings returned to before. </p><p></p><p>"Change for me!" She pointed at Li Fan from afar.</p><p></p><p>As light gathered, another figure slowly took form beside him.</p><p></p><p>Shockingly, it was another simulated personality!</p><p></p><p>"A person can't multitask! You're occupying one, you still think you can occupy a second one?"</p><p></p><p>"Get to work!" Yan Fajue put one hand on her hip and smugly pointed at the second simulated personality, ordering.</p><p></p><p>"And how do you know I can't?"</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought, this second simulated personality actually spoke with Li Fan's voice again.</p><p></p><p>Mockingly looking at Yan Fajue.</p><p></p><p>The expression on Yan Fajue's face suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>"Fine, fine, fine! I want to see just how many you can split your mind into!"</p><p></p><p>"Change for me! Change! Change! Change!..."</p><p></p><p>Little loli Yan Fajue kept pointing non-stop in the air as simulated personality phantoms kept being generated one after another.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>One hundred, five hundred, one thousand...</p><p></p><p>Image after image of Li Fan's face occupied the entire internal space of the character light sphere. </p><p></p><p>They mocked in unison:</p><p></p><p>"Is that all?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this the extent of your ability?"</p><p></p><p>"Keep going."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The number of differentiated simulated personas, amidst Li Fan's mocking words, was already approaching ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>However, beads of sweat had already formed on the little girl's forehead.</p><p></p><p>She temporarily stopped her actions, her big eyes staring at the densely packed Li Fans before her, full of disbelief. </p><p></p><p>"You're not human?"</p><p></p><p>"What the hell are you?"</p><p></p><p>There was no intention to insult, but in Yan Fajue's knowledge, ordinary cultivators indeed could not achieve this.</p><p></p><p>Occupying a simulated persona was not just a matter of differentiating a thread of divine sense.</p><p></p><p>It was more akin to splitting the soul in two and occupying one half.</p><p></p><p>To simultaneously control so many simulated personas was equivalent to shattering the soul into ten thousand pieces, yet still remaining unaffected.</p><p></p><p>She was only able to do this by relying on the ability of a Heavenly Wonder. </p><p></p><p>As for the other party...</p><p></p><p>Yan Fajue couldn't help but feel a hint of wariness in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to keep going?"</p><p></p><p>Over ten thousand Li Fan faces smiled simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>"Even if there were a hundred thousand more, I could still endure it," Li Fan said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>The little girl carefully observed Li Fan's main body guarding the space in Yan Fajue's domain.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, he appeared unaffected, eyes closed in contemplation, his expression serene.</p><p></p><p>Yan Fajue couldn't help but hesitate.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that ten thousand was her limit.</p><p></p><p>She was just worried that if the two of them continued to compete, it would draw the attention of the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>And Yan Fajue's Dharma manifestation was constantly being monitored by the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Yan Fajue finally conceded reluctantly. </p><p></p><p>"Alright! I admit you're somewhat formidable!"</p><p></p><p>The little girl swallowed the surrounding simulated personas back one by one.</p><p></p><p>Only the original one remained.</p><p></p><p>After a burp, Yan Fajue finally said, "That being said, what exactly do you want to do? I can tell you definitely don't have good intentions."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head, "You've misunderstood me."</p><p></p><p>"I came here to help you regain your freedom."</p><p></p><p>Yan Fajue was unconvinced, "Freedom? What's so good about freedom? Besides, I've already helped Chuan Fa for so many years. Wouldn't it be a pity to give up halfway?"</p><p></p><p>"From beginning to end, all I wanted to do was slack off," Yan Fajue reiterated.</p><p></p><p>"What benefits did Chuan Fa promise you?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph..." Yan Fajue refused to answer this question. </p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I can also help you. And you won't need to pay any price," Li Fan said very amiably.</p><p></p><p>Yan Fajue was full of disbelief, "There's such a good deal?"</p><p></p><p>"I just can't stand seeing Chuan Fa exploit others," Li Fan said.</p><p></p><p>Yan Fajue's eyes lit up, and then she looked as if she had a sudden realization, "I know! You have a grudge against Chuan Fa! That's why you came to me, wanting to undermine his foundation!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not deny it, "You could say that."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Yan Fajue actually began to seriously consider it.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, Chuan Fa said he could help me find my home. Can you do it?" Yan Fajue asked probingly. </p><p></p><p>"Home?" Li Fan's eyes flickered. "Explain in more detail."</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Yan Fajue approached and plopped down not far from Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Propping her chin in her hands, she sank into recollection, "Before I was found by Chuan Fa and became Yan Fajue, although I was just an ordinary little girl, I vaguely had memories of my previous life."</p><p></p><p>"The scenes in those memories are my true homeland."</p><p></p><p>Yan Fajue sensed Li Fan's gaze on her and said somewhat helplessly, "I said it was vague. I can't remember the specifics, but as long as I see it with my own eyes, I can definitely distinguish the real from the fake."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan slightly furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to speak, Yan Fajue seemed to have already detected what he was going to say. She rolled her eyes at Li Fan. "I'm not stupid. How could I be fooled by Chuan Fa's empty words and work for him for so many years?"</p><p></p><p>"Back then, he did show me some images of my homeland. But I can't show them to you..."</p><p></p><p>Yan Fajue gestured vaguely.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded, "I've heard that the Heavenly Wonders of the Profound Yellow Realm are either the laws of the realm or the incarnations of upper realm immortal artifacts. Could your homeland be the Immortal Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Fajue looked a bit dejected, "Who knows? But I hope I'm not from some Immortal Realm. Otherwise, I'd have no hope of returning home."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, do you have the ability to help me?" Yan Fajue asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head, "Before figuring out the specific origin of your homeland, I can't make a conclusion."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Yan Fajue couldn't help but be a little surprised, "I thought you would directly make a promise and try to deceive me."</p><p></p><p>"It seems you're not that bad." The little girl re-evaluated Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled faintly, "However, give me some time. I will let you identify all the possible scenes one by one."</p><p></p><p>"Really?" Yan Fajue became half-believing, half-doubting.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, can you tell me about your fifty-year plan now?" Li Fan didn't directly answer but asked in return.</p><p></p><p>After considering for a moment, Yan Fajue said in a low voice, "Actually, it's nothing much. Just to have a good sleep and grow up a bit."</p><p></p><p>"After growing up, I'll become stronger. Dealing with these tasks will be much easier then."</p><p></p><p>"Tasks that now require ten years to complete will probably take less than a year by then."</p><p></p><p>A hint of longing flashed in Yan Fajue's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan's eyes gradually narrowed.</p><p></p><p>"You just need to sleep for fifty years? No other conditions?"</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean by just sleeping for fifty years? Don't make it sound so easy," Yan Fajue was a bit dissatisfied. </p><p></p><p>Then she nodded in acknowledgment, "That's right. Actually, if I had time to rest properly, I feel I could have grown up a bit long ago."</p><p></p><p>"After all, for me, Dharma manifestation is equivalent to cultivation for you cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"After cultivating for so long, if there's no progress at all, wouldn't I be a big fool?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Fajue said righteously.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained silent, but from Yan Fajue's words, he had already guessed what she meant by growth.</p><p></p><p>Like the Final Detachment Disc, it was a matter of sublimation and breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the pinnacle of mortality.</p><p></p><p>And even...</p><p></p><p>If the source of Yan Fajue was an upper realm immortal artifact, then restoring its former immortal artifact might was not impossible.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

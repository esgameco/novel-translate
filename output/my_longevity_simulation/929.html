        <h1>Chapter 929</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Do you want it?"</p><p></p><p>These few words seemed to be spoken by different people, with varying tones and intonations.</p><p></p><p>They echoed in the sect's grand hall, lingering for a long time.</p><p></p><p>It made the already somewhat strange scene even more eerie.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Qing showed no fear at all: "If the Heavenly Venerate dares to give, I dare to take."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shijie's laughter abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing instantly felt as if thousands of gazes were looking at her from different directions in the grand hall.</p><p></p><p>"The remnants of the Xuantian Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"Even if I give it to you, so what? Can you leave my Dadao Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Only one cold voice questioned.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing smiled slightly: "How would I know if I don't try?"</p><p></p><p>The provocative meaning of this sentence was really too strong. Even though Li Qing's behavior in the illusion was special, at this moment it seemed as if she had truly angered the Yixin Heavenly Venerate.</p><p></p><p>Beside Li Qing, in this originally empty grand hall, thousands of human faces suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>The expressions on the faces varied, but they all stared at Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, from below the faces, in the void darkness, pale arms stretched out from nowhere. Grabbing towards Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Li Qing was submerged by these tide-like pale limbs.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that she would soon disappear in this grand hall.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>A moment later, countless shrill screams suddenly emitted from these human faces.</p><p></p><p>There was panic, fear, and resentment in the voices...</p><p></p><p>As if there was something extremely terrifying on Li Qing's body, without exception, they scattered in all directions much faster than when they were scrambling to devour her!</p><p></p><p>In the center of the grand hall, that teenage Zhao Shijie, for the first time had a slight emotional fluctuation on her calm face.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>Above Li Qing, several stone pillars appeared out of nowhere. They fell down with a crash, forming a cage, trapping Li Qing inside.</p><p></p><p>"On your body..."</p><p></p><p>"What is that thing?"</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of wariness in Yixin Heavenly Venerate's cold tone.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing smiled and asked in return: "I also wanted to ask the Heavenly Venerate? Do you have any clues about this object?"</p><p></p><p>The grand hall was silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then Yixin's voice sounded again: "I previously had doubts about whether you were from the Xuantian Sect, but now I'm starting to believe it a bit."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that we can no longer merge into one."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing smiled without answering.</p><p></p><p>She only sensed a flickering seven-colored orb in her soul.</p><p></p><p>Since she became conscious, this thing had been suppressed deep in her soul.</p><p></p><p>It was obviously implanted by the original when creating the clone.</p><p></p><p>The seven-colored orb was not important, what was important was the thing sealed inside the orb.</p><p></p><p>Even with the obstruction of the seven-colored divine light, Li Qing always felt a sense of imminent danger.</p><p></p><p>It was conceivable that the sealed object inside must be extremely dangerous.</p><p></p><p>There were no memories about this object in Li Qing's mind, but she knew that the reason the original dared to let her venture into the Dadao Sect alone at the Yuanying stage was by relying on this object as a deterrent!</p><p></p><p>Although such a fierce thing was hidden in her soul, Li Qing was fearless.</p><p></p><p>Her thoughts turned in an instant, and she looked at the young Zhao Shijie sitting straight ahead, then said solemnly: "The Heavenly Venerate has now attained the position of immortality, so those techniques are useless to the Heavenly Venerate."</p><p></p><p>"But for our Xuantian Sect, they are very important. The Heavenly Venerate doesn't..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If you fulfill this request, our Xuantian Sect will surely repay you greatly in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Yixin Tianzun still remained silent, Li Qing hesitated for a moment before adding, "In fact, our Xuantian Sect is not unreasonable. If Tianzun is willing to return the item to its rightful owner, we will provide appropriate compensation."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, I believe this is something Tianzun will definitely be interested in," Li Qing said confidently.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, the thousands of frightened faces suddenly crowded forward again. </p><p></p><p>"Compensation..." The faces let out strange laughter in unison.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Sect was destroyed a thousand years ago, and you people are all rats that can't see the light of day."</p><p></p><p>"What do you have that's worth my..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, they all stopped abruptly.</p><p></p><p>They stared at the golden light that suddenly appeared in Li Qing's palm, their expressions completely frozen!</p><p></p><p>This place, the Dadao Sect, was the foundation of her achievement of immortality.</p><p></p><p>Although still within the Xuanhuang Realm, it could be considered as a separate realm within a realm, completely under her control.</p><p></p><p>Only this abruptly appearing golden light...</p><p></p><p>Yixin Tianzun was certain that the source of the golden light was not from within Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>But from outside the Dadao Sect!</p><p></p><p>To be able to ignore her restrictions and come and go freely...</p><p></p><p>Sensing the energy contained within the golden light, the ancient memories from the former Dadao Sect elders couldn't help but surface.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Senior Sister Zhao's reaction, Li Qing knew that the true self's strategy had succeeded.</p><p></p><p>So he said loudly, "A temporary defeat does not represent a lifetime of defeat. These years of dormancy do not mean that we will disappear into the long river of history."</p><p></p><p>"Even a worm with a hundred feet still struggles after death. Let alone the legacy of true immortals?" Li Qing held his head high.</p><p></p><p>Having obtained several secret arts from the Xuantian Sect, Senior Sister Zhao was naturally very clear about the terrifying foundation of the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Just a few inherited secret arts had almost created her, an immortal of the Changsheng realm.</p><p></p><p>The true legacy of the Xuantian Sect was definitely unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>More crucially...</p><p></p><p>Although the destruction of the Xuantian Sect back then was a joint effort by the Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao, according to the secret records of the Dadao Sect, that battle of annihilation was extremely strange.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they had no intention of completely destroying the Xuantian Sect in one battle. Who knew that in the midst of fighting, the opponent suddenly collapsed on their own.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, on the battlefield that day, the Xuantian King, who was said to be a half-step true immortal, did not appear at all.</p><p></p><p>That's why the battle was so easy.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao had also suspected at the time whether there was some kind of conspiracy behind this.</p><p></p><p>Fearing that the Xuantian King would return at any time, they issued a kill order for the remnants of the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to force out this hidden half-immortal.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, it was as if he had truly vanished from the world, never appearing in the Xuanhuang Realm again.</p><p></p><p>"Does the resurgence of the Xuantian Sect mean that the Xuantian King will also reappear in the world?"</p><p></p><p>This question couldn't help but surface in Yixin Tianzun's mind.</p><p></p><p>After all, the gray mold and golden light of willpower displayed by the other party were obviously not something ordinary cultivators could possess.</p><p></p><p>Yixin Tianzun did not ponder for too long.</p><p></p><p>In her view, having one more troublemaker in the Xuanhuang Realm was not a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>Although the half-immortal realm was powerful, the Xuanhuang Realm was also not what it used to be.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the re-emergence of this half-immortal would bring about changes and vitality.</p><p></p><p>In the great hall, the thousands of pale, sinister faces staring at Li Qing vanished in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The gloomy hall also became bright at the same time.</p><p></p><p>"This one likes the gift you brought very much."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 716</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>And he even participated in the capture of spies for the Five Elders Association before...</p><p></p><p>It seemed even more absurd.</p><p></p><p>He casually left those words and a "Empty Ming Stone Mother" behind, and then quickly left. He didn't attract anyone's attention.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai also remained calm, quickly collecting the Stone Mothers that were filled up.</p><p></p><p>After a look, the types and quantities of items were exactly as he had requested.</p><p></p><p>"In this aspect, the Five Elders Association does have some merits. At the very least, they are much more reliable than the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance," Xu Bai silently pondered.</p><p></p><p>Although there were some twists and turns, he finally obtained the required real bait.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Bai still couldn't leave Tianliangzhou now.</p><p></p><p>Because the series of cases caused by Wang Qiupu had not officially concluded, and as the initiator, he naturally had the obligation to continue cooperating with the investigation.</p><p></p><p>However, at this time, most of the public's attention was focused on settling scores with the old party of Wang Qiupu and the clandestine competition for vacancies. He was temporarily forgotten, left in peace.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, amidst the vast white fog.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening? Yesterday when I checked it, there were only five Discs of Dispersal left to exchange. How come the quantity has now returned to six?" Puxian Zhenzhou was rushing through the fog, while Huangfu Song suddenly exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao's face changed drastically, "Could it be that we have entered some strange mysterious domain? Time has flowed back to a day ago?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan fell silent for a moment and then said somewhat helplessly, "It should be due to the impact of Wang Qiupu's case. One of the four people who exchanged the Discs of Dispersal should be related to Wang Qiupu. With suspicions of being a spy, such a treasured item of the Immortal Alliance like the Discs of Dispersal naturally couldn't remain in his possession. It must have been taken back."</p><p></p><p>The three of them had just come out of the mystery domain not long ago and had resumed communication with the Tianxuan Mirror. So they were aware of the recent major event in the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Dongfang and Huangfu immediately understood upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"It seems like Brother Li, your mind works quickly," Dongfang Yao chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song breathed a sigh of relief, "Initially, I was a bit worried that with our progress, we wouldn't be able to snatch the Discs of Dispersal. With this extra one appearing out of nowhere, it should be guaranteed."</p><p></p><p>The three of them coincidentally focused on their Qingxuan points.</p><p></p><p>"36,000 points."</p><p></p><p>According to their previous experience, as long as they completed exploring one or two more mystery domains, they could make up the remaining 14,000 points.</p><p></p><p>"Now, even in the remote areas within the white fog, one can occasionally encounter the figures of cultivators. It seems like the entire Immortal Alliance is flooding in like bees. It's really outrageous! The map of the areas we have explored is no longer useful," Dongfang Yao complained.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, fortunately Brother Li has extraordinary abilities, being able to hear inexplicable voices from within the mystery fog," Huangfu Song glanced subtly at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, Brother Li, what kind of sounds did you hear, could you describe them to us?" Huangfu Song asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan coldly chuckled in his mind, about to reply.</p><p></p><p>"Sky..."</p><p></p><p>"Healing..."</p><p></p><p>But the ghostly voice sounded again in Li Fan's ears.</p><p></p><p>"There's a mystery domain nearby." Li Fan, who had gradually become familiar with this, not only felt no fear but also stopped the rushing Puxian Zhenzhou, focusing to discern the direction from which the sound was coming.</p><p></p><p>However, this time seemed somewhat different from before.</p><p></p><p>Because the wails resembling "sky healer" grew louder and louder.</p><p></p><p>It was as if...</p><p></p><p>A mystery domain was rapidly approaching!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's complexion changed suddenly, his spiritual sense rapidly expanding outside the white fog, trying to understand the situation around him.</p><p></p><p>But the white fog was calm as a pond, without any ripples.</p><p></p><p>He had no idea where the crisis was coming from.</p><p></p><p>"Sky..."</p><p></p><p>"Healing!"</p><p></p><p>The furious, resentful voices became clearer.</p><p></p><p>You could distinctly hear that they were indeed the words "sky healer."</p><p></p><p>They were coming from all directions, like countless mad ancient beasts, roaring towards them nonstop.</p><p></p><p>The deafening noise made Li Fan's eardrums ache. </p><p></p><p>He glanced at Huangfu and Dongfang.</p><p></p><p>Noticing that even so, they seemed not to have heard this terrifying sound.</p><p></p><p>"Is there something wrong around us?" It was the alert Dongfang Yao who suddenly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>The sense of sudden crisis surged in his mind more and more. Li Fan made a decisive decision.</p><p></p><p>Puxian Zhenzhou accelerated abruptly, attempting to break through the mist.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a massive hand suddenly reached out from below the white fog.</p><p></p><p>"What is this thing?" Huangfu Song's expression immediately changed, letting out a scream while not being slow in the movement of his hands.</p><p></p><p>He tossed a light yellow formation flag, flying like an arrow towards the huge hand.</p><p></p><p>The formation flag exploded, turning into yellow threads that bound the giant hand, causing it to pause slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Run!" Huangfu Song hurriedly shouted, his tone very panicked.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for their words, Li Fan had already fully activated the Puxian Zhenzhou and fled far in the direction they came from.</p><p></p><p>It's not like the three of them had any thoughts of lingering in battle; it was just that the unexpectedly appearing giant hand was too horrifying.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had previously seen the severed palm of the Ancient Venerable outside the Eternal Immortal Stronghold at the Roaring Abyss.</p><p></p><p>But even the shocking impact brought by the palm of the Ancient Venerable was far less than the giant hand they had just seen!</p><p></p><p>Because, the so-called hand was actually made up of bodies of cultivators, stacked and patched together.</p><p></p><p>In that momentary insight, Li Fan could even see their twisted bodies and faces, as well as the strange black threads linking their bodies together!</p><p></p><p>What made Li Fan even more eerie was that even though there was no trace of vitality on these bodies of the cultivators, their mouths kept opening and closing, emitting a hoarse howl from the depths of hell.</p><p></p><p>"Sky!"</p><p></p><p>"Healing!"</p><p></p><p>While Huangfu Song's "Thousand Threads Hundred Folds Array" temporarily trapped the giant hand, another one suddenly appeared from the depths of the white fog.</p><p></p><p>The rough movement tore apart the yellow threads.</p><p></p><p>The three of them could see that it was still an enormous arm formed by numerous connected bodies of the dead, eerie and bizarre, as if an undead giant lurked in the white fog, watching and pursuing them.</p><p></p><p>"Could the Alliance's Skyrending Cannon be for dealing with this guy?" Dongfang Yao shouted loudly, his voice trembling a bit.</p><p></p><p>He clenched his fist towards the giant behind him.</p><p></p><p>The black rifts exploded like blades, booming. It was the divine ability that Dongfang Yao had comprehended in the fissure vortex of the Rift Boundary.</p><p></p><p>But this killing move that could even slightly tear space, fell on the dead giant, and couldn't even slow down its movement.</p><p></p><p>The bodies of the dead cultivators that made up its body were shattered by the black flaws, immediately replaced by another one wriggling out from the depths of the corpse pile.</p><p></p><p>This horrifying scene made Huangfu and Dongfang shiver directly.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

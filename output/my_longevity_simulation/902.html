        <h1>Chapter 902</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Transmitter was the highest-ranking figure in the Myriad Immortals Alliance that Li Fan could come into contact with since entering the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, what was even more fascinating was that this Dharma Transmitter was not a true Dharma Transmitter.</p><p></p><p>His true identity was that of the sinister Xuantian Sect's Dharma King.</p><p></p><p>"Once reaching the position of Dharma Transmitter, casually revealing any information would have unimaginable value and endless benefits."</p><p></p><p>"The only difficulty now is how to contact this Mo Rubin and gain his trust."</p><p></p><p>Just like with the Fallen Immortal Realm before, Li Fan only glimpsed a small portion of Mo Rubin's memories.</p><p></p><p>However, anything related to cultivation techniques, divine abilities, or secret arts in these memories failed to be preserved.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, to successfully impersonate in front of this Xuantian Sect's Dharma King without being exposed still required long-term planning.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's infiltration into the Myriad Immortals Alliance seemed to have no impact on the current situation in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>During this period, the conflicts between the Myriad Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Society continued unabated.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was still the Dharma Transmitter's Dharma Projection, which repeatedly appeared in the Five Elders Society's territory.</p><p></p><p>The techniques it could use became more and more numerous, and the Dharma Projection also became more vivid.</p><p></p><p>Judging from the latest images transmitted from the Five Elders Society, subtle emotional fluctuations could even be observed on the originally solemn and dignified face of the Dharma Transmitter.</p><p></p><p>It was truly alarming.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was this increasingly realistic Dharma Projection of the Dharma Transmitter that also made the five Longevity Celestial Venerables feel a bit uneasy.</p><p></p><p>When the Dharma Transmitter's Dharma Projection appeared once again, rolling dark clouds suddenly came from the horizon, directly enveloping the sky.</p><p></p><p>The state was instantly plunged into absolute darkness, sealed off inside and out, and the Dharma Transmitter's Dharma Projection was also completely swallowed by the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not know the final outcome.</p><p></p><p>However, after this battle, the Myriad Immortals Alliance indeed restrained themselves a lot.</p><p></p><p>The frequency of releasing the Dharma Transmitter's Dharma Projection slowed down significantly, but it did not completely stop.</p><p></p><p>As for the Five Elders Society, they seemed to have lost hope in the Myriad Realms United Association's ability to gather information about the Thirty-Three Immortal Candidates.</p><p></p><p>Requests for assistance and inquiries almost disappeared.</p><p></p><p>At most, they pretended to inquire about the sudden destruction of the "Congyun Sea Mutual Aid Society".</p><p></p><p>Li Fan only responded that the Congyun Mutual Aid Society had no connection with the Myriad Realms United Association.</p><p></p><p>The situation of the Myriad Realms United Association was very favorable.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders Society should just mind their own business.</p><p></p><p>However, paper cannot wrap fire after all. As the Dharma Transmitter's Dharma Projection was used more frequently, rumors about it finally spread within the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Even though the alliance officially prohibited public discussion, it could not stop the enthusiastic cultivators of the alliance.</p><p></p><p>For a time, there were various opinions. All kinds of speculations sprang up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also paid attention to investigate and collect them.</p><p></p><p>However, one of the rumors caught Li Fan's attention.</p><p></p><p>It said that this Dharma Transmitter's Dharma Projection was likely related to the ubiquitous statues of the Dharma Transmitter in the alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, have you ever thought about why there is a stone statue of the Dharma Transmitter in every celestial city?"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, I don't know if you have ever used the long-distance teleportation array. The inside of these stone statues has actually been hollowed out and used as a carrier for the long-distance teleportation array!"</p><p></p><p>"This is such a blasphemy!"</p><p></p><p>"Although the Dharma Transmitter does not interfere in worldly affairs, his divine might still exists. If it weren't for his permission, would those in power in the Myriad Immortals Alliance dare to do this?!"</p><p></p><p>"I dare to say with certainty that..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"There must be something strange about this!" declared the cultivator named Yue Gu with conviction.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Yue makes a very good point! No wonder every time I use that long-distance teleportation array, when I see the cloud cluster representing the Xuanhuang Realm, there's always an indescribable oddity in my heart."</p><p></p><p>"I think you're overthinking it. It's obvious that the Heavenly Venerate's Dharma Image was manifested through the thirty-three Immortal Chosen Ones, what does it have to do with that stone statue!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone had their own opinions, and no one could convince the others.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, on the other hand, recalled the stone statues transmitting the Dharma in the many celestial cities, wearing tall crowns, and pondered.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Realm holds a unique and important position in the heart of the Dharma Transmitter."</p><p></p><p>"Even if he temporarily leaves, he shouldn't have left the [Darkest Star Space]. And if I were the Dharma Transmitter, to be on the safe side, I would definitely leave a backup plan in the Xuanhuang Realm. Just in case."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps these stone statues are the means of the Dharma Transmitter."</p><p></p><p>"And the thirty-three Immortal Chosen Ones are the keys to activating this means."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan secretly speculated in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan was not in a hurry to seek confirmation.</p><p></p><p>In any case, he had already left a piece of detached disc in the body of Wei Qizheng, one of the Immortal Chosen Ones, in advance. As long as Wei Qizheng perished, the recorded secrets would be fed back to Li Fan's side.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not believe that with the cultivation level of the thirty-three Immortal Chosen Ones at most reaching the Unification Realm, there would be no price to pay for activating the Heavenly Venerate's Dharma Image so frequently.</p><p></p><p>So before the end of this world, he would definitely be able to wait for the day of Wei Qizheng's demise.</p><p></p><p>As long as there were no inexplicable accidents.</p><p></p><p>Temporarily putting aside the turmoil in the Xuanhuang Realm, Li Fan began to refine his avatar again in the secret room of the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>The previous avatar, Ji Shaoli, had already died at the hands of the young Dharma Transmitter. The Xuanhuang Realm was fraught with dangers, and without an avatar, it was really inconvenient.</p><p></p><p>What was different from the previous avatar refinement was that Li Fan, who had mastered the [Infinite Void Method], performed special treatment on the avatar's soul.</p><p></p><p>He excised all memories related to [Huan Zhen] from the soul.</p><p></p><p>And modified the remaining parts.</p><p></p><p>The avatar would still transmit sensations to the main body, but the experiences of the main body could only be passively and selectively accepted.</p><p></p><p>In the avatar's memory, he was an avatar created by an ancient Xuantian Sect's Dharma King who had awakened from a deep slumber.</p><p></p><p>Due to severe injuries, his own memories were also incomplete.</p><p></p><p>But he remembered the kindness of the Xuantian King back then and vowed to rebuild the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>So he secretly gathered forces from various small worlds and organized the Myriad Realms Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Recruiting soldiers and horses for the restoration of the sect.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Fan was unable to perform such methods of modifying the soul.</p><p></p><p>But after mastering the Infinite Void Method, it became possible to achieve.</p><p></p><p>Although the method was a bit crude, because it could not accurately cut and would even directly cause soul trauma.</p><p></p><p>But with the Infinite Void Method's monstrous ability to repair the soul, Li Fan was barely able to achieve targeted modification of the soul after constant attempts.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had falsified the memories of the avatar Ji Shaoli to deceive the young Dharma Transmitter.</p><p></p><p>It was relying on this method.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the avatar in front of him, with a masculine appearance and feminine features, extraordinarily handsome, Li Fan showed a satisfied expression.</p><p></p><p>"True caution is to guard against even one's own avatar."</p><p></p><p>"And when necessary, it can be thrown out as bait."</p><p></p><p>This was where Li Fan had progressed after experiencing the events with the young Dharma Transmitter and the Dharma King of the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Pointing at the avatar's brow, its eyebrows trembled slightly as it gradually awakened.</p>

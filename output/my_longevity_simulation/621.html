        <h1>Chapter 621</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Is he the only one? What about Ziyun Immortal Lord?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan had already rehearsed in his mind the game between the two after they meet.</p><p></p><p>Including, but not limited to: Hongxi Immortal Lord facing the current situation of being marginalized and ousted, rising up to fight back, relying on the appeal of his transcendent cultivation to quickly regain the support of the vast majority of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Or, Hongxi Immortal Lord appearing calm on the surface, temporarily soothing the situation. When Li Fan relaxes, he moves like thunder, launching a sudden offensive and completing a turnaround in the situation. Finally, on some fabricated grounds, he dismisses Li Fan from his position.</p><p></p><p>And so on.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan never expected that when Hongxi Immortal Lord really saw him, instead of any tension, he burst into laughter and gave Li Fan a big hug as soon as he approached.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's body stiffened slightly, a hint of confusion flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Do I know you well?" he thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Hongxi Immortal Lord, completely oblivious to the strange look in Li Fan's eyes, patted his shoulder with great satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"Great! You're doing well! After hearing that Wanxian Island was almost uprooted by the Five Elders, Ziyun and I were worried that the Cloud Sea would be in a mess from now on. But unexpectedly, you emerged out of the blue. In the past few years, not only did various assessment rankings not drop, they even rose by several positions!"</p><p></p><p>"Why didn't you wake up earlier? Otherwise, I wouldn't have been troubled by various matters all these years?"</p><p></p><p>"Keep it up! Next, I'll leave the political affairs of the Cloud Sea to you!"</p><p></p><p>Hongxi Immortal Lord seemed very pleased.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but fall silent.</p><p></p><p>While Hongxi, clad in white, seemed as relaxed as ever, humming an unknown tune as he returned to the table in the room.</p><p></p><p>Gracefully pouring himself a cup of tea, he sipped it contentedly.</p><p></p><p>"Every day lying still can witness merit soaring, this is life." He lazily remarked.</p><p></p><p>Turning around to see Li Fan still standing in place, he immediately gestured, "Hey, don't be so formal. Come, have a cup of tea too!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Lord City Master!" Li Fan did not refuse, approaching and sitting down.</p><p></p><p>After Hongxi had another cup of tea, he continued, "Ziyun and I heard about your deeds at the Immortal Alliance headquarters. Tsk tsk, indeed worthy of an disciple from an ancient sect, a bit more competent than us current cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"So, at what realm is your cultivation restored now? Golden Core, Nascent Soul?" Hongxi Immortal Lord glanced at Li Fan, then shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Can't see through it, can't see through it!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan calmly replied, "Regardless of the cultivation realm, now I am just a subordinate of the City Master."</p><p></p><p>Hongxi Immortal Lord chuckled, "Then I'm just a subordinate of the Prime Ministers, and even they are subordinates of the Law Givers. "</p><p></p><p>"All serving the Immortal Alliance, what difference does it make?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression immediately turned solemn, "The Lord's thoughts are truly extraordinary. I admire you!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan still so formal, Hongxi Immortal Lord's expression suddenly became downcast. Shaking his head, he sighed, "Really old-fashioned! Boring, really boring."</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, as long as you continue to handle the political affairs for me and everything remains the same."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Hongxi Immortal Lord's attitude, which didn't seem feigned, Li Fan couldn't help but ask, "Don't you want to resume governing?"</p><p></p><p>Hongxi Immortal Lord burst into laughter again, "You just don't understand. But that's okay, you'll understand in the future. It won't hurt to tell you now."</p><p></p><p>"I've been in charge of the Cloud Sea for nearly two hundred years, always diligent. Not achieving any great feats, but also not making any mistakes."</p><p></p><p>"However, these days have come to an end. Want to move forward again?"</p><p></p><p>Hongxi Immortal Lord sighed slightly, "Difficult!"</p><p></p><p>"So many Cultivators at the Nascent Soul stage in the Immortal Alliance. Wanting to compete with them without attaining the Dao... Better to enjoy the peace and freedom here in my Cloud Sea."</p><p></p><p>"These petty political matters, you can handle them carefully for a year, two years, even ten years, thirty years."</p><p></p><p>"But what about a hundred years, two hundred years?"</p><p></p><p>"I've been bored for too long. But reluctant to resign. I entrust these matters to my subordinates, who are all just loafers, and I don't trust them."</p><p></p><p>"Many years have passed, and finally, there's someone like you!"</p><p></p><p>"Ziyun, she's staying in the mainland to attend some 'Friendly Interactions Conference' - truly rare occasion. I don't even want to bother attending that event held once every few hundred years, and just couldnâ€™t wait to come back to see you."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, you didn't disappoint me!"</p><p></p><p>Hongxi Immortal Lord sighed.</p><p></p><p>"I heard you were worried before that when I returned, I would seize your power? No need for that! I'm eager to hand over all these messes to you!"</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, tomorrow I'll gather everyone and explain this matter. You will still be in charge in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face twitched involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>But he still bowed, "Thank you very much for your kindness, Lord City Master."</p><p></p><p>Hongxi Immortal Lord patted Li Fan's shoulder again, "Keep up the good work! Although your merit point increases each year due to that forbidden method are slightly less than mine, you're no longer in the same league as those cultivators who toil hard every year to complete missions."</p><p></p><p>"And, I heard that during your tenure as acting Island Lord and overseeing the construction of Cloud City, your duties were equivalent to those of the City Master."</p><p></p><p>"When calculated like this, your merit level should have risen quite quickly in these years."</p><p></p><p>"Why haven't you received any merit points every year? How come I haven't received any?"</p><p></p><p>The tea Hongxi Immortal Lord was drinking spurted out of his mouth in shock, as he stared at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, right? You haven't received any merit points? Then what have you been toiling for these years?"</p><p></p><p>"I..." Li Fan hesitated to speak.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly realizing the deep generation gap between them, he could only remain silent.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps you haven't been participating in the annual settlement in the Tianxuan Mirror." After a while, Hongxi Immortal Lord looked at Li Fan with a strange look.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shrugged, "No one has ever mentioned this to me."</p><p></p><p>Hongxi Immortal Lord smacked his head.</p><p></p><p>"Uh..."</p><p></p><p>He said somewhat listlessly, "Then go check it out quickly. There may be some surprises."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded, gave a bow, and hastily left.</p><p></p><p>Watching Li Fan's gradually disappearing figure, Hongxi Immortal Lord shook his head, "Ah, truly the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance. Unconcerned by matters that don't involve them..."</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan returned to the Tianxuan Mirror and after some inquiries, he finally learned what the annual settlement was all about.</p><p></p><p>Turned out, each main governing official of the various regions, apart from their annual contribution "salary", also received "performance" rewards based on the overall ranking of their regions in the entire Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Settled once every year, in addition to the contribution salary, there were also significant merits.</p>

            <p>Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Tianyang Puppet, surrounded by flames all over its body, suddenly flew down from the sky and plunged into the ground.</p><p></p><p>With continuous rumbling sounds, a deep passage was dug out in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Countless tree people flew into it.</p><p></p><p>They were following Li Fan's orders to excavate the ore and other resources buried deep underground.</p><p></p><p>If one looked out from the top of the Spirit Tree, one could see that such scenes were everywhere in the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Master, it took the Spirit Tree more than 4,000 years to slightly restore the vitality here. The world's ecology is still very fragile. If we excavate destructively like this..." The Tree Clan Leader advised with concern.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly: "Your perspective is still too small. Resources unused and buried underground are no different from ordinary stones. Only by making full use of them and developing quickly is the right way."</p><p></p><p>"We just need to become strong enough to plunder and nourish ourselves from other worlds before resources are exhausted and the world declines."</p><p></p><p>"Limiting oneself to one world and sticking to the old ways, even if one can survive for a while, will eventually be annexed by other worlds."</p><p></p><p>The Tree Clan Leader was obviously hearing this theory for the first time and was stunned on the spot: "Is...is that so?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not answer, but showed an inscrutable face.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the countless tree people working hard in this realm, he suddenly had a whim: "If I help these tree people improve their overall strength, I wonder if there will be feedback on the cultivation of Zuoxian Jue."</p><p></p><p>Tree people cannot cultivate. Their strength is fixed from birth. </p><p></p><p>And the strength of tree people depends on the Spirit Tree itself. New 69 Book Bar â†’ 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>The more powerful the Spirit Tree, the stronger the tree people born from it.</p><p></p><p>For such spiritual objects of heaven and earth, if the method is appropriate, they can grow much faster than cultivators.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, Li Fan himself knew of no less than ten heavenly and earthly treasures that could nourish the Spirit Tree.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Sharing the overall vision of the Spirit Tree, Li Fan was very clear about where the valuable resources were hidden in this world.</p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's guidance, Tianyang drilled through the ground like a loach, taking a few days to open up the passage first.</p><p></p><p>After letting the Tree Clan Leader supervise the tree people's mining work, Li Fan took Tianyang and temporarily returned to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>On the way out, he didn't forget to make a trip to the ruins of Tianji Sect.</p><p></p><p>He looted all the treasures including the [Heaven and Earth Qiankun Dice].</p><p></p><p>"Now, there is no [Multiverse Alliance] in the world yet. Suddenly approaching them like this, wanting to gain the trust of the Five Elders, I'm afraid it will take a lot of effort like in the previous lives."</p><p></p><p>"It's better to first think of a way to make the [Multiverse Alliance] famous..."</p><p></p><p>"Anchor to 6 years."</p><p></p><p>The various events that happened this year in his memory flashed through Li Fan's mind one by one, and he quickly found a suitable target.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Five Elders will launch a surprise attack on the Nine Mountains Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Trying to seize this territory.</p><p></p><p>It ended in a disastrous defeat.</p><p></p><p>This matter was repeatedly mentioned by the Wanxian Alliance as a classic case.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan was very clear about the beginning, end and details of the matter.</p><p></p><p>As the bordering area between the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders, due to being transformed from the death of the exotic beast [Tian].</p><p></p><p>The space was extremely unstable, and teleportation arrays could not be used within the prefecture.</p><p></p><p>So the management cost was too high, and the Wanxian Alliance only built cities to guard the key locations of the Nine Mountains Pass.</p><p></p><p>Most other places were not paid much attention to.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it bred other prefectures difficult to</p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The strange scene he saw: a mix of fish and dragons.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the Wanxian Alliance, there were also many local forces led by the Lingyuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>As well as many hidden agents cultivated by the Five Elders Society.</p><p></p><p>Jiushan State, easy to defend but difficult to attack. Whichever side occupied it would gain a strategic advantage from the high ground.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders Society had always wanted to incorporate it into their own territory.</p><p></p><p>But they were at a loss as to how to do it.</p><p></p><p>And not long after, the reason they launched another attack was because they thought they had won over the [Lingyuan Sect].</p><p></p><p>The Lingyuan Sect, as the largest local force in Jiushan State, although under the rule of the Wanxian Alliance, was relatively independent.</p><p></p><p>There were many Yuanying and Huashen cultivators in the sect, and the sect members were extremely united.</p><p></p><p>It was a force not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Once they defected, with inside and outside forces working together, it was indeed possible to take down Jiushan State in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that the Five Elders Society, after several contacts with the Lingyuan Sect and confirming that the other party would lend a helping hand,</p><p></p><p>launched the surprise attack.</p><p></p><p>But somehow the news leaked out, and the reinforcements from the Wanxian Alliance arrived very quickly.</p><p></p><p>As if they had predicted it early on.</p><p></p><p>And seeing that the situation was lost, the Lingyuan Sect defected again on the spot.</p><p></p><p>They counterattacked the Five Elders Society.</p><p></p><p>The strategic focus was shifted to Tianling State.</p><p></p><p>"Lingyuan Sect..." Li Fan quickly pondered the cause and course of events.</p><p></p><p>He also recalled this rather strange organization and frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>Although in the overall pattern of the Xuanhuang Realm, this Lingyuan Sect was just an ant-like existence.</p><p></p><p>But looking at Jiushan State, it was definitely not to be ignored.</p><p></p><p>With the Wanxian Alliance's style of doing things, they actually tolerated such an independent organization under their rule.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the special terrain of Jiushan State, it was also related to the Lingyuan Sect being "inextinguishable like wildfire".</p><p></p><p>"Cangsheng Lingyuan Cultivation Method. The more people cultivating at the same time, the faster the speed of cultivating this technique."</p><p></p><p>"Enough to offset the negative effects brought about by the incompatibility of the techniques."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a general understanding of this cultivation method before.</p><p></p><p>But he had no interest in cultivating such a method that was clearly fishy at first glance.</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master of Lingyuan has never shown his face in any public occasion. His identity is extremely mysterious."</p><p></p><p>"In the past, even if the Lingyuan Sect was wiped out, relying on the characteristics of the cultivation method, it would quickly rise again in less than a year."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, in addition to the 'Cangsheng Lingyuan Cultivation Method', there seem to be other secret techniques within the sect. Not only can they solve the killing intent brought about by cultivating the same technique, but they can also repeatedly and cyclically use the Grotto-Heavens."</p><p></p><p>"For example, the Chen Yurou I saw before, her [Peach Blossom Grotto-Heaven] had appeared on previous cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"There should be some special restrictions. Otherwise, no matter how well he hides, he would definitely be found out."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slowly pondered everything about the Lingyuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>"But this trip, I don't have to clash with them."</p><p></p><p>"I just need to help the Five Elders Society take down Jiushan State."</p><p></p><p>Thinking so, Li Fan stood on the Tianyang Puppet and rushed towards Jiushan State.</p><p></p><p>After entering the territory of Jiushan, he set up an array around his body to conceal his aura.</p><p></p><p>He came to the vicinity of Tianlao Mountain and hid.</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elders Society probably never thought that their defeat was not because there was a traitor leaking information."</p><p></p><p>"But merely a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Fan soon saw a young man in white clothes slowly appearing from the horizon.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>I went on a business trip today and only came back in the evening. I'm too tired, sorry there's only one update.</p>

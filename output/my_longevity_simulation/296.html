        <h1>Chapter 296</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, despite the effort, I have yet to encounter a fortuitous opportunity in this life."</p><p></p><p>When the last golden thread disappeared from the Soul Gathering Orb, Li Fan couldn't help but sigh with such emotion.</p><p></p><p>Nothing unexpected happened.</p><p></p><p>Another two months passed. Although it couldn't be said that Li Fan made no progress at all, his success rate in discernment only increased from one in ten thousand to one in a thousand.</p><p></p><p>He still couldn't perceive the difference between normal souls and contracted souls. The so-called discernment was still just blind guessing based on intuition.</p><p></p><p>This of course could not satisfy the requirements for constructing the "Heavenly Profound Soul Locking Formation".</p><p></p><p>"It seems I can only come and try again next time."</p><p></p><p>"The only thing I'm a bit reluctant to part with is this high-grade Huanyu Courtyard that allows me to enter the spirit awakening state at public expense."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head and seized the last bit of time to cultivate for free.</p><p></p><p>A dozen or so days later, the monthly assessment arrived once again.</p><p></p><p>Most of the cultivators had exhausted all the Soul Gathering Orbs in their hands, so this assessment was also the final test to determine who would stay and who would leave.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's performance was very stable.</p><p></p><p>In the formation construction knowledge portion, he was still top-notch.</p><p></p><p>But in discerning soul contracts, he remained at the bottom.</p><p></p><p>"Only those with a discernment success rate of over 50% have the opportunity to continue their studies."</p><p></p><p>"All those who fail to meet the standard will be expelled from Huanyu Courtyard starting today."</p><p></p><p>"And relevant personnel will be notified."</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao swept his gaze over the young cultivators below and said coldly.</p><p></p><p>When his eyes landed on Li Fan for a moment, they flickered slightly, but that was all.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't break the rules for the sake of this stranger.</p><p></p><p>At these words, out of the over a thousand cultivators, nearly a hundred turned deathly pale, as if they had lost their parents.</p><p></p><p>But at least there were no undignified scenes of people crying and begging for another chance.</p><p></p><p>Only Li Fan had a carefree look. Those who didn't know better might think he had passed the assessment.</p><p></p><p>Ji Hongdao waved his hand, and a layer of white light enveloped these eliminated cultivators, including Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, this group of over a hundred people appeared in a spacious and empty courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be discouraged even if you've been eliminated. Go back to where you came from. Continuing to contribute a bit of your strength to the development of the Myriad Immortals Alliance is also very meaningful!" The speaker was a plump middle-aged cultivator with a very conspicuous tuft of goatee on his chin.</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator revealed a kind smile and patted each of these eliminated youths one by one.</p><p></p><p>As he patted, he explained, "It's not that the organization doesn't trust you, it's just that the confidentiality level of the 'Heavenly Profound Soul Locking Formation' is a bit high."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators he patted flashed with light and disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart instantly sounded a huge alarm, thinking this fat cultivator had come to silence them.</p><p></p><p>The other party's strength was unknown, but these young cultivators with Golden Core cultivation had no ability to resist him at all.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was obviously no match for him either.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to silently recite the Returning to Truth Mantra, he heard the other party continue, "Relax, we're just sealing the part related to the 'Heavenly Profound Soul Locking Formation' in your memories."</p><p></p><p>"Don't look at me with such horror, I know what you're thinking. But this is Tianyu City, a key location of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. Who knows how many pairs of eyes are watching this place. How could that kind of thing possibly..."</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator mumbled while quickly carrying out his work.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan breathed a sigh of relief like the other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't completely trust the fat cultivator's words and remained on guard, ready to recite the mantra at any time.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask how to address Senior?" When it was Li Fan's turn, he suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>The fat cultivator was stunned for a moment, and his movements slowed.</p><p></p><p>"You're an interesting kid. I have a feeling we'll meet again someday." The fat cultivator sized up Li Fan and said, "I'm called Huangfu Song."</p><p></p><p>Although he said this, his actions didn't delay at all.</p><p></p><p>He slapped Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>As light burst forth, Li Fan felt dazed and found himself in another courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The exit seemed to be right ahead.</p><p></p><p>"Sign this confidentiality agreement and hand over your Huanyu Token, then you can leave on your own. I suggest you don't rush back. Since you've come all the way to our Tianyu Province, it would be a pity not to look around. I recommend the Discourse Tower in the east of the city, where cultivators from all over choose to stay. It's extremely lively. There's also free spirit tea provided." At the entrance, a cultivator as thin as a bamboo pole stood guard.</p><p></p><p>His face had a smile uglier than crying. Whenever a cultivator came before him, he would take out a golden contract and hand it to them.</p><p></p><p>Only after they signed it and handed over their Huanyu Token would he let them leave.</p><p></p><p>The skinny cultivator sent off the dejected young cultivators who had completed the procedures, while introducing them to places worth visiting in Tianyu Province.</p><p></p><p>Soon, it was Li Fan's turn.</p><p></p><p>As usual, Li Fan asked, "How should I address Senior?"</p><p></p><p>"Shangguan Shi," the other party simply replied and placed a glittering golden contract in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be of a higher grade than the common "Business Contract", but not as good as the "Soul Contract" of the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan scanned the contents of the contract with a glance.</p><p></p><p>It was a unilateral contract with harsh conditions.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who leaked secrets would have their soul destroyed.</p><p></p><p>In any case, Li Fan had no choice but to sign. Without hesitation, he wrote down his name with a flourish.</p><p></p><p>A golden light entered his body. Shangguan Shi nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You may go!"</p><p></p><p>Cupping his hands, Li Fan stepped out and left Huanyu Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"This is a bit awkward now. I'm afraid even Zhang Zhiliang wouldn't have expected me to be directly eliminated in the first round."</p><p></p><p>"Calculating the time, there should still be over a year until the Scorching Flame Sea Burning."</p><p></p><p>"I definitely can't go back. I'll just follow the original plan and travel around Tianyu Province for a while. After Senior He finishes his closed-door training, I'll go seek him out directly."</p><p></p><p>"As for Zhang Zhiliang..."</p><p></p><p>"I suppose he won't give up the opportunity to merge with the Dao and come find trouble with me over this small matter."</p><p></p><p>Recalling the Discourse Tower mentioned by Shangguan Shi earlier, Li Fan, who had nowhere to go for the time being, inquired about its location and headed straight there.</p><p></p><p>The Discourse Tower was not just a single building.</p><p></p><p>It was a series of connected structures.</p><p></p><p>Not only did it provide services such as gatherings and dining, there were also many small courtyards like Huanyu Courtyard for lodging.</p><p></p><p>The main hall of the tower was extremely lively, filled with seated cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Most had low cultivation. Li Fan estimated the highest was only at the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p></p><p>He casually found an empty seat and sat down. A cup of spirit tea automatically appeared on the table.</p><p></p><p>Taking a sip, he felt the spiritual energy in his body surging, extremely refreshing.</p><p></p><p>After finishing it in one gulp, he placed the cup on the table.</p><p></p><p>The spirit tea welled up from the bottom of the cup, refilling it.</p><p></p><p>This time Li Fan didn't drink, but picked up a jade tablet on the table engraved with the character "Dao".</p><p></p><p>After probing it with his spiritual sense, countless dishes of various styles appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Almost all of them had some effect of improving physique and tempering the purity of spiritual energy in the body.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the prices were also extremely expensive.</p><p></p><p>Each dish cost several hundred contribution points.</p><p></p><p>"This Discourse Tower definitely couldn't survive in Congyun Sea."</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary cultivators simply can't afford it."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan randomly ordered a few dishes to try the effects.</p><p></p><p>While waiting, he perked up his ears to listen to the conversations of the surrounding cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't much different from the scene of people chatting about everything under the sun in a mortal tavern.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of topics.</p><p></p><p>A certain cultivator had improved by a minor realm; someone was approaching the end of their lifespan but still failed to break through, dying with regret.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders Council hadn't made any big moves in recent years, so they must be secretly plotting something.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan listened to all of this without feeling bored.</p><p></p><p>Before long, flashes of light appeared as the ordered dishes and tableware automatically materialized on the table one after another.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan tasted each one, sensing the changes in his body, and secretly nodded.</p><p></p><p>"This Discourse Tower indeed has some tricks."</p><p></p><p>Just then, the already somewhat noisy main hall suddenly erupted with some clamor.</p><p></p><p>A few keywords drifted into his ears. Li Fan was slightly stunned and couldn't help but focus on listening.</p><p></p><p>"Shh, keep a low profile. This trip to the underground Secluded Forest was indeed a small harvest. After appraising it with the Heavenly Profound Mirror, the Spiritual Tortoise Purple Truth Fruit can extend lifespan by 150 years." Daoist Lü's voice sounded a bit smug.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk..."</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Tortoise Purple Truth Fruit, I remember it wasn't on the list of spirit fruits given by Supremely Accomplished Immortal, right? Doesn't that mean..."</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Lü has encountered great fortune this time!"</p><p></p><p>"Extending lifespan by 150 years, that is an extremely incredible treasure. I just don't know what rank it can get in the bounty hunt application. If it's lucky enough to be in the top three..."</p><p></p><p>"That would be a Dharma Derivation Orb..."</p><p></p><p>Everyone's breathing unconsciously quickened.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan listened to the conversation between the few people, his expression shifting slightly.</p><p></p><p>He immediately stopped bothering to finish clearing the remaining food and directly booked a courtyard in the Discourse Tower to stay in.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, there was a Heavenly Profound Mirror inside the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>After some searching, Li Fan instantly understood the whole story.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that ever since Supremely Accomplished Immortal resigned from his position as the Commander-in-Chief of the Defense Ministry to focus on healing his injuries, although his condition had gradually improved, the lost lifespan could not be recovered.</p><p></p><p>Like all cultivators approaching the end of their lifespan, Supremely Accomplished Immortal began seeking various life-extending methods.</p><p></p><p>However, Supremely Accomplished Immortal had held a high position for many years and had basically already tasted all kinds of life-extending heavenly materials and earthly treasures, which had lost their effectiveness on him.</p><p></p><p>So he issued a bounty hunt, lasting three years, for the entire Myriad Immortals Alliance to search for life-extending exotic treasures that would still work for him.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who could prove the effectiveness would be provided with generous rewards.</p><p></p><p>The more lifespan increased, the more bountiful the reward.</p><p></p><p>And the special rewards for the top three were even more heart-stirring for cultivators across the world.</p><p></p><p>A chance to use the Dharma Derivation Orb.</p><p></p><p>It was well-known that cultivation techniques were hard to come by in the world.</p><p></p><p>And wanting to tailor-make a cultivation technique according to one's own situation was even more difficult.</p><p></p><p>Although Dharma Weavers could do this, firstly the cost was steep, and secondly, the skill levels of Dharma Weavers varied. The techniques they compiled were far from perfect.</p><p></p><p>It was just a second-best choice.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, for the vast majority of cultivators under the heavens, this was just an unattainable dream.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Derivation Orb was the foundation of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, incomparably precious!</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people didn't even know what it looked like or where it was located.</p><p></p><p>Let alone using it.</p><p></p><p>Even ordinary Harmonized Dao realm experts might not have the qualifications to utilize it.</p><p></p><p>It was only because Supremely Accomplished Immortal had controlled the Defense Camp for nearly 550 years and held a lofty position with great authority, experiencing countless battles big and small during that period and obtaining various merits, that he could take out the reward of three chances to use the Dharma Derivation Orb.</p><p></p><p>"First place can derive a Harmonized Dao cultivation technique. Second place, Nascent Divinity. Third place, Nascent Soul."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the explanation of the rewards. He had to admit he was tempted.</p><p></p><p>He happened to have a life-extending exotic treasure.</p><p></p><p>The Lifeborn Longevity Fruit could extend lifespan by 300 years.</p><p></p><p>And it just so happened to not be on the list of exotic treasures Supremely Accomplished had already consumed.</p><p></p><p>For him, this longevity fruit wasn't of much use.</p><p></p><p>But if he exchanged it for Supremely Accomplished Immortal's reward...</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the superiority of a custom-made cultivation technique, just being able to see the alliance's treasure, the Dharma Derivation Orb, was already worth the price in Li Fan's view.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that this Lifeborn Longevity Fruit comes from the Fallen Immortal Realm. Generally speaking, only Golden Core realm cultivators can enter."</p><p></p><p>"I'm only a Foundation Establishment cultivator. Submitting it like this is a bit inappropriate."</p><p></p><p>"In any case, the Immortal's bounty hunt has only been going on for less than a year. I can wait until I break through to the Golden Core realm before submitting it."</p><p></p><p>"That way, I can openly explain its origin."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... Dealing with a Harmonized Dao Immortal will inevitably have some risks."</p><p></p><p>"I still need to carefully consider it."</p><p></p><p>In the next few days, Li Fan wandered around Tianyu City.</p><p></p><p>He also went to see the wonder Shangguan Shi mentioned, the "Ice Abyss Fire Lotus".</p><p></p><p>In the cold ice abyss, countless flame-formed lotus flowers bloomed.</p><p></p><p>Although it looked beautiful, Li Fan couldn't see anything particularly special about it.</p><p></p><p>It was said that some cultivators had comprehended the Dao here and directly improved by a minor realm. It seemed his comprehension ability was still lacking.</p><p></p><p>On the way back from the cold ice abyss, Li Fan's communication talisman suddenly received a message from Ji Hongdao.</p><p></p><p>Telling him to return to Huanyu Courtyard quickly.</p>

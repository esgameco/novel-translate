        <h1>Chapter 753</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"It seems there exists some kind of natural limitation that prevents the fusion of all beasts," the Princess said with some regret. "However, we have made significant progress in our research on catalysts that can promote fusion. I believe the birth of the first fusion beast is not far off." The Princess quickly regained her confidence.</p><p></p><p>"The Beast Fusion Crucible, the unification of flesh and blood..." For a moment, Xu Bai recalled the [Emperor One] he had seen in the Meteor Immortal Realm. Without a doubt, the inspiration for the Empire's "Myriad Manifestation Crucible" came from this primordial beast.</p><p></p><p>As the origin of the demonic beasts in the Xuanhuang Realm, Emperor One's strength must be no less than the Longevity Realm. If the Empire truly succeeded in mass-producing fusion beasts, even if they were greatly weakened versions, their might would be absolutely formidable.</p><p></p><p>"Have you evaluated the specific strength of the demonic beasts refined from the crucible? If the experiment succeeds, can you control them? Aren't you afraid they'll turn around and destroy the Empire?" Xu Bai raised a series of questions.</p><p></p><p>The Princess said confidently, "The exotic beasts put into the Myriad Manifestation Crucible are all individuals we control through the [Concordant Technique]. Although their physical bodies disappear after being refined by the crucible, the bond remains."</p><p></p><p>"By converging all the mental fluctuations of the [Concordant Technique], we can create a device to manipulate the fusion bodies. You don't need to worry about them going out of control."</p><p></p><p>"And according to previous evaluations of their strength, the fusion bodies we can currently produce should be no weaker than the Integrated Cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm..." The Princess spoke with some hesitation but eventually said slowly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai nodded slightly, this result was within his expectations. However, he did not issue any warnings about the Empire's puzzling overconfidence. He simply took out his folding fan skillfully and waved it lightly: "Not bad, the Void Meridian Stabilizing Instrument, [Spirit Crystal Marrow], and potential future support from Integrated Cultivators..."</p><p></p><p>"With these, it should be enough to convince the Allied Assembly to provide you with protection."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, give me a few more [Spirit Crystal Marrows]. I'm afraid those old fellows won't easily believe it without seeing it for themselves."</p><p></p><p>The Princess did not mind Xu Bai's request. She casually tossed over ten [Spirit Crystal Marrows].</p><p></p><p>Without further ado, Xu Bai collected them and flew out of the Empire's treasury.</p><p></p><p>"Get ready. If there are no accidents, the Allied Assembly elders will come with me next time for the final inspection."</p><p></p><p>"Those fellows are not as easy to talk to as I am."</p><p></p><p>Leaving the treasury and returning to the high tower palace, Xu Bai gave a few brief instructions before not lingering any further.</p><p></p><p>He transformed into a ray of light and shot up into the sky, disappearing from the sight of the Empire's people in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Apprentice Qing..." The Princess looked at Little Qing, seeming to have many questions.</p><p></p><p>Little Qing, however, kept his gaze fixed on Xu Bai's back, not shifting it for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"It's hard to discern the truth or falsehood in this person's words. But we can be sure he means no harm. And the entrance to our world does indeed seem to be hidden by some unknown formation."</p><p></p><p>"Let's prepare as he says. What choice do we weaklings have? The weak have little choice." Little Qing said in a gloomy tone.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Empire, in the dark void of space.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Bai was flying away, he suddenly sensed a ripple in the surrounding space.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, a [Void Roaming Dragon] appeared by his side, affectionately nuzzling its head against his leg.</p><p></p><p>It seemed somewhat familiar - it was indeed the one he had casually tamed on his way here.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to sense that Xu Bai was about to leave, it had come to bid farewell.</p><p></p><p>The Void Roaming Dragon was overjoyed, twisting its body to let Xu Bai ride on its back.</p><p></p><p>Then, following Xu Bai's instructions, it repeatedly traversed the void, heading towards the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the entrance valley, Xu Bai first stored the Void Roaming Dragon within his own Celestial Being realm. He then used the Terminal Disk to dispel the illusion of seclusion that had been deceiving the Celestial Spiritual Treasure.</p><p></p><p>Passing by the entrance to the Longevity Valley, he did not enter.</p><p></p><p>He only quietly released the Void Roaming Dragon before returning alone to Tianliangzhou.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Longevity Valley, Liu San, who had been notified in advance, marveled at the strange beast.</p><p></p><p>"So inconspicuous, yet capable of traversing space." He brought the Void Roaming Dragon into the valley and concealed the entrance again.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Bai's permission, how the dragon would go on to make waves and become a king in the Beast Realm is another story.</p><p></p><p>"We have sufficient reason to suspect that the Celestial Spiritual Treasure is constantly monitoring the state within cultivators' bodies. If it did not have a certain level of mastery over the body, the so-called cultivation guidance advice could not be so accurate and effective," Fang Zaiji said with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>"Does any cultivator in the Myriad Immortal Alliance not know this? But they all still accept it willingly. After all, compared to improving their own cultivation, these things are insignificant," Liu San rolled his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, you don't understand what I mean," Fang Zaiji said, unusually not explaining further.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"It's not mocking Liu San, but rather a very serious explanation," he said solemnly. "If the Heavenly Profound Mirror can achieve transcendence by measuring the heavens, the earth, and the world, then what changes will occur after it has obtained the physical data of so many cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>These words caused Liu San to be startled.</p><p></p><p>"In the ancient cultivation world, there is a saying that the human body is the most perfect creation. In order to ascend to immortality, no matter whether you were originally human or not, you must first transform into a human form."</p><p></p><p>"Although it's just a rumor, the authenticity is no longer verifiable. But the fact that humans can defeat demonic beasts and become the true masters of the Xuanhuang Realm already demonstrates the limitless potential of being human."</p><p></p><p>"So the Heavenly Profound Mirror may very well have the intention of taking on a human form," Fang Zaijie said meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>"Then, Mr. Fang, is this the conclusion you've reached after researching for so long?" Li Fan interrupted Fang Zaijie's words.</p><p></p><p>In his hand, the Separation Disc had become several times more crystal-clear than before.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the war across the myriad realms had already begun, and some owners of the Separation Discs, aware of their insufficient strength, had abandoned the practice of nurturing the discs with formations. In a short period of time, the one in Li Fan's possession had consecutively devoured three other Separation Discs.</p><p></p><p>Believing that victory in the ultimate struggle was not far away, Li Fan was not very concerned about the various rewards announced by the Myriad Immortal Alliance for the conquest of the myriad realms. He could thus immerse himself wholeheartedly in the transformation of the Separation Disc.</p><p></p><p>Even when inquiring about Fang Zaijie's research progress on the Apocalypse Disc, he did not stop feeding the formation data.</p><p></p><p>Multitasking.</p><p></p><p>"Have you found a way to shield the Heavenly Profound Mirror from scanning the cultivators' physiques?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaijie let out a laugh: "The idea is there, but to actually do it..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaijie slowly explained the reason.</p><p></p><p>"To shield the Heavenly Profound Mirror from perceiving the outside world, one only needs to temporarily fabricate a single scene with spiritual consciousness. Similarly, to influence the Heavenly Profound Mirror's scrutiny of one's own physique, one would need to conjure a false body."</p><p></p><p>"But... therein lies the difficulty."</p><p></p><p>"Although it's just a simple body, it contains countless tissues, blood, and even traces of spiritual power circulation. It's like a world unto itself. Unless one's understanding of the subtle details of the physique matches that of the Heavenly Profound Mirror, there will inevitably be flaws."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaijie said helplessly, "The Heavenly Profound Mirror resides in the cultivator's sea of consciousness and scans the physique during its formation. If there is suddenly a very obvious difference, it will immediately detect it."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, each person's constitution is not exactly the same. Achieving a universal solution is almost an impossible task."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Fang Zaijie's response, Li Fan understood the difficulty of this matter.</p><p></p><p>Even Dao-Realm cultivators might not be able to guarantee complete mastery of their own bodies, let alone those below the Dao Realm. Asking them to weave a false body to deceive the Heavenly Profound Mirror would undoubtedly be full of loopholes.</p><p></p><p>"To achieve complete control over one's own body... Unless..."</p><p></p><p>"'Establishing the Foundation with Myself.'"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately thought of this term.</p><p></p><p>However, he soon shook his head slightly. The difficulty of "Establishing the Foundation with Myself" was truly too high, and in all these years in the Xuanhuang Realm, there had been no reports of anyone succeeding. Even a genius like Yin Shangren had left behind tremendous aftereffects...</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? The difficulty of cultivation?" A brilliant idea suddenly flashed in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Profound Mirror is said to be able to guide cultivators in their cultivation, right?</p><p></p><p>What would happen if the Heavenly Profound Mirror was tasked with guiding the "Establishing the Foundation with Myself" technique?</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Li Fan explained the concept of "Establishing the Foundation with Myself" to Fang Zaijie and the others, and proposed his own conjecture.</p><p></p><p>"Establishing the Foundation with Myself, without relying on external factors. How ingenious! Wouldn't this in a sense break through the limitations of new techniques?" Fang Zaijie exclaimed in awe after hearing the idea.</p><p></p><p>"That such a brilliant idea came from a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator is truly... " He couldn't help but feel somewhat disbelieving.</p><p></p><p>"But upon further reflection, if aided by the Heavenly Profound Mirror's comprehensive scanning ability, perhaps 'Establishing the Foundation with Myself' can indeed be realized." Fang Zaijie pondered for a moment and became quite excited.</p><p></p><p>Liu San also seemed to be deep in thought: "Cultivators cannot fully know themselves, but they can seek an alternative path with the help of the Heavenly Profound Mirror. If successful, they can then come back and summarize the method of 'Establishing the Foundation with Myself,' which should greatly reduce the difficulty."</p><p></p><p>"If there are those with exceptional talent, they may even be able to summarize an effective technique that everyone can practice." </p><p></p><p>"To be able to realize 'Establishing the Foundation with Myself' through one's own power alone. Completely feasible! Worth a try! If I hadn't already reached the Dao Realm, I'd be tempted to immediately abandon my cultivation and start over, just to try this extraordinary foundation-building technique!" Fang Zaijie was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded and said, "To rely on the Heavenly Profound Mirror for cultivation, we need to obtain merit points from the conquest of the myriad realms. I'll also need to trouble Elder Liu to arrange some disciples to do this task. Since their Qi-refining cultivation is at a low level, it's best to send some people to accompany them."</p>

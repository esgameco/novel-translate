        <h1>Chapter 569</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>He certainly did not mean to court disaster.</p><p></p><p>Every trade he had with the Five Elders Guild ended up in Li Fan's favor. He even wished for more such opportunities, so how could he break the contract voluntarily?</p><p></p><p>The spy from the Five Elders Guild was long gone, leaving only Li Fan at the trading location.</p><p></p><p>With the destruction of the stone table with inscriptions, Zhou Qing'ang swiftly returned to the Congyun City.</p><p></p><p>On his way back, Li Fan pondered over some unusual signs during the negotiation process.</p><p></p><p>The real enticement fruit, the humane stardust, these precious treasures were useful to cultivators in the Harmony Realm, yet the Five Elders Guild agreed to trade with only a limited number.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could understand this.</p><p></p><p>But as for the True Boat of Pu Xuan, the Five Elders Guild was reluctant to offer more, insisting on a strict exchange without any concessions. They even preferred compensating with other precious items rather than compromising.</p><p></p><p>This left Li Fan puzzled.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Pu Xuan True Boat was something that could be easily acquired on the roadside back when the puppet body was wandering the Five Elders Guild.</p><p></p><p>How did it suddenly become invaluable?</p><p></p><p>What exactly happened?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't make sense of it.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until Zhou Qing'ang returned to the Political Office and saw the map of the area around Congyun Sea hanging on the wall that a sudden insight flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>He stared at the natural boundaries of the various states on the map, contemplating the existence named the "White Mist Barrier," as if he had understood something.</p><p></p><p>"The supply and demand determine the price."</p><p></p><p>"Although the actual value of the Pu Xuan True State is not high, if the Five Elders Guild is now massively using it, and it is extremely scarce..."</p><p></p><p>"It all makes sense."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts spun quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Five Elders Guild planning to advance into the White Mist?"</p><p></p><p>"Should they follow the White Mist Barrier, invade the interior of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals, or venture deeper into the White Mist?"</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan himself was shocked by this sudden thought.</p><p></p><p>Over the past few years, due to the White Mist's nature of consuming lifespan, cultivators tended to avoid it.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that these White Mist Barriers could be used as natural waterways?</p><p></p><p>While the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals already knew that the Pu Xuan True Leaves could reduce the impact of the devouring White Mist to a certain extent, the practical application had not been widespread yet.</p><p></p><p>This was undoubtedly a significant blind spot in the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals' thinking.</p><p></p><p>The seemingly absolute safety of the White Mist Barrier could potentially be flooded with numerous hostile cultivators in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>Whichever way you looked at it, it was a very chilling prospect.</p><p></p><p>"I hope it's just my groundless worries. The Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals has countless talents and geniuses; they must have precautions for such things..."</p><p></p><p>With a plan in mind, Zhou Qing'ang deliberately made himself very busy for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>He started accommodating visit requests that he would usually refuse, and went on inspections to various islands in Congyun Sea whenever he had free time.</p><p></p><p>Within just three or four days, he had interacted with hundreds of individuals of different statuses.</p><p></p><p>This way, even if the Five Elders Guild wanted to investigate his sources or trace the traces of the Overturning Heaven Alliance, it would be almost impossible.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if the Five Elders Guild had extraordinary methods and captured and searched all these people, they wouldn't find anything. They would never imagine that all the secret information of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals came solely from Li Fan!</p><p></p><p>After five days, Li Fan arrived at the Wan Cang Pavilion on the Youlan Island with a damaged formation map.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest chamber, he met the representative of this trade.</p><p></p><p>They were still cloaked in black attire and concealed their features.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan could tell that this cultivator was different from the one he had met last time.</p><p></p><p>"Excellent! Friend Zhou has kept his promise, and we will not disappoint you," praised the black-clad cultivator as he looked at Li Fan, who had arrived as agreed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan inquired about the former spy from the Five Elders Guild.</p><p></p><p>The black-clad cultivator spoke solemnly, "To fulfill his mission, he chose self-sacrifice. That's our fate and our honor."</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the spy Li Fan saw disintegrate into golden light had truly perished.</p><p></p><p>With his life as the price, he obtained a contract imprinted with the marks of the five celestial beings.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded without saying another word.</p><p></p><p>He handed over a storage ring containing encrypted jade slips.</p><p></p><p>The black-clad cultivator solemnly accepted it, saying, "Please wait here for a moment, friend."</p><p></p><p>With that, he left with the ring without disclosing his destination.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan patiently waited with closed eyes.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't worried about the safety of this avatar. On the one hand, due to the existence of the golden contract, which prohibited mutual harm. On the other hand, Zhou Qing'ang currently represented a massive organization hidden deep within the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals, a member of the Overturning Heaven Chamber. Moreover, he was the only means of contact with the Overturning Heaven Chamber.</p><p></p><p>Unless the Five Elders Guild was ready to cut ties with the Overturning Heaven Chamber and no longer access the secrets of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals from them, they would not make a move against Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Especially now that they were at war with the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals and could not afford to make new enemies.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it couldn't be ruled out that the Five Elders Guild might resort to underhanded tactics, like using items such as the Real Enticement Fruit to forcefully turn Li Fan against his allies.</p><p></p><p>So, while waiting, Li Fan remained vigilant and ready to abandon this avatar at any moment.</p><p></p><p>The efficiency of the Five Elders Guild was swift.</p><p></p><p>In just the time it took to finish a cup of tea, the black-clad cultivator returned to the secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>Though he tried to conceal it, one could vaguely discern his excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Your methods are indeed remarkable; I admire them!"</p><p></p><p>"This is what we promised, please check it," the black-clad cultivator said, handing over a white stone.</p><p></p><p>"What is this..." Li Fan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, with his broad knowledge, Li Fan searched through his memories of magical stones and then realized the purpose of the white stone.</p><p></p><p>The Empty Bright Stone Mother.</p><p></p><p>A naturally-occurring storage material that, unlike ordinary storage rings, had a much larger storage space. It could be absorbed and refined by cultivators, stored within the body, and was essential for creating spatial treasures. Extremely precious and almost unavailable on the market.</p><p></p><p>This item was not on the list of goods Li Fan had proposed, clearly intended as a storage device given to him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly, then directly swallowed the Empty Bright Stone Mother.</p><p></p><p>Rather than immediately refining it, he first inspected its contents.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the Five Elders Guild wouldn't skimp on quantities. Ten thousand Enlightenment Pills, three hundred Pu Xuan True Boats, three pieces of humane stardust...</p><p></p><p>All in accordance with the contract.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan focused his attention on the statue among the various items, emitting a five-colored radiance in the center.</p><p></p><p>The next chapter will be available tomorrow afternoon. My condition isn't great, so I'll go to bed early. (End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 560</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"One hundred million contributions, that's one hundred million contributions!" He Zhenghao's eyes were bloodshot, and his whole body couldn't help but tremble slightly uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>The constantly rising prices brought a psychological stimulus that made him feel like he was floating and in a dream-like state.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao vowed that he had never been so happy in his life before.</p><p></p><p>"The Lord Commander mentioned casually when giving me the list of supplies that since I am in charge of this fundraising, the profit share given to me has increased from one percent of the first three times to ten percent..."</p><p></p><p>"In just one day, I earned contributions that I couldn't earn in my whole lifetime."</p><p></p><p>The hot blood rushed to his head, and He Zhenghao felt like his body was boiling.</p><p></p><p>A boundless courage surged in his heart, and the strict rules of the Immortal Alliance, which he usually greatly respected, seemed no longer intimidating.</p><p></p><p>"Raise the price! The price is rising so quickly, surely I am not the only one doing this. Misery loves company!"</p><p></p><p>"Besides, even if the sky falls, the Lord Commander will bear the responsibility. I am only following orders!"</p><p></p><p>"He won't blame me for sure!"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao muttered to himself, quickly convincing himself, with not a trace of fear in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He was filled only with the ecstasy of massive profits.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the Immortal Alliance, there were many cultivators who, like He Zhenghao, were joyful and excited.</p><p></p><p>In an unknown space.</p><p></p><p>"A great harvest, a great harvest. The profits this time have directly made up for the losses from before. There are even surpluses!"</p><p></p><p>"How about it! I was right! I knew that Li Fan had some skills, and this time we bet correctly! Following him, we're eating good!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Lu Dao-you, I remember, didn't you clearly express opposing views last time?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense! You must be mistaken!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao looked at his companions around him, who were ecstatic, feeling a little excited himself.</p><p></p><p>Up to this point, he had made nearly two million contributions in profits. Although he didn't know the specific profit situation of others, judging from their performances, they had definitely earned a lot as well.</p><p></p><p>"Li Fan's predictive ability is truly terrifying. He could predict in advance a war that erupted suddenly without any signs."</p><p></p><p>As for the reason for the sudden declaration of war by the Immortal Alliance, Zhou Kebao and the others were still inquiring about it.</p><p></p><p>But they hadn't received any definite results yet.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, we were too cautious. If we had invested more at the beginning, it would've been better."</p><p></p><p>Such a thought suddenly flashed through Zhou Kebao's mind.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Where's Long Dao-you?"</p><p></p><p>The room fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, I remember he was very decisive this time, spending at least five million contributions to store supplies in advance. He must have made a huge profit!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he's in seclusion and doesn't realize that the prices have skyrocketed?"</p><p></p><p>"I'll contact him to share the good news!"</p><p></p><p>To their surprise, all the messages went unanswered. There was no reply at all.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at each other in confusion.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were puzzled, the figure of Long Yaoyou appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>Confused, with bloodshot eyes and a pale face, Long Yaoyou looked lost.</p><p></p><p>In the hearts of everyone present, an indescribable premonition arose.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, Zhou Kebao was the first to ask, "Long Dao-you, what happened? Why are you..."</p><p></p><p>Long Yaoyou seemed a bit absent-minded.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Kebao called out several times before he finally came back to his senses.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the people around him, Long Yaoyou's lips trembled slightly, and with all his strength, he finally slowly uttered, "My elder brother... he has fallen!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Everyone felt like their brains had been hammered, feeling a bit dizzy.</p><p></p><p>Long Jiuyuan, who had just achieved the rank of Daoist Venerable, had fallen?</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the room fell into a dead silence.</p><p></p><p>The slight joy of earning many contributions was instantly gone for them.</p><p></p><p>For them, losing a Daoist Venerable cultivator was something that no amount of contributions could make up for!</p><p></p><p>In the midst of shock, there was also a sense of dread in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>How many people would actually die in this war?</p><p></p><p>For a moment, these profit-seeking cultivators also couldn't help but feel a chill.</p><p></p><p>The political hall of the Congyun City was in chaos.</p><p></p><p>Although the Immortal Alliance had issued a war preparedness notice, they were unable to contact the Lord Commander no matter what.</p><p></p><p>Even though a month ago, Li Fan had already announced that he would be in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>But with such a major event happening, he abandoned his responsibilities and left us, his subordinates, to deal with the difficult situation...</p><p></p><p>Wasn't that a bit too much?</p><p></p><p>The cultivators couldn't help but feel resentful.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone!"</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan looked at the various expressions on everyone's faces and knocked on the table.</p><p></p><p>"Now that the Lord Commander is absent, it's our time to be tested," he said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Although the current situation is unclear, what is beyond doubt is that this war will not end easily. We must be mentally prepared."</p><p></p><p>"Especially since Congyun Sea borders the Five Elders Council, we must patrol vigilantly and guard against the opponent's cultivators."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, seeing the worried faces of the people, Gao Yuan had to reassure them, "But you don't have to worry too much."</p><p></p><p>"As they say, when disaster strikes, there will be someone to stand up. Since the last time Congyun Sea was defeated by the Five Elders Council, we haven't been able to recover."</p><p></p><p>"We don't even have many Yuan Infant cultivators. With this level of strength, it shouldn't require us to go all out."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the people felt somewhat comforted by his words.</p><p></p><p>However, Gao Yuan had another thought weighing heavily on his mind, which he kept to himself.</p><p></p><p>If it really came to the point where all the remaining people from Congyun Sea had to go to the battlefield, the intensity of this war...</p><p></p><p>Gao Yuan couldn't help but shudder.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>While the whole Immortal Alliance was in chaos due to the sudden war preparedness notice, Li Fan was very relaxed.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the drink in the cup shimmering with a blue light, Li Fan raised his thumb and praised, "Good wine!"</p><p></p><p>"Such fine wine, coupled with Senior Sima recounting the exciting events from thousands of years ago. Life is truly fulfilling, what more can one ask for!"</p><p></p><p>"I've been using the book recommendation app recommended by an old book buddy I've known for ten years, a great substitute app! It's so useful, I use it for listening to books while driving or before sleeping, it's really great for passing the time."</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong's face was slightly flushed, "Although I have only just met with Senior, I have a feeling of immediate camaraderie. 'Yuan' is a wonderful word, indeed!"</p><p></p><p>"Come, let's have another drink!"</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong also poured the wine into his stomach.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, what story from the ancient times would you like to hear next?"</p><p></p><p>"We cannot trace the events of ancient times, but I am somewhat knowledgeable about the history since the reincarnation of the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>His face flushed, and he spoke proudly.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that about five hundred years ago, there was a collective uprising of small worlds, launching an attack on the cultivation world."</p><p></p><p>"I ask Friend to enlighten me!"</p>

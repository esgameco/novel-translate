        <h1>Chapter 414</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After unexpectedly learning about the legacy of Tianyang Zhenren, not only did Li Fan gain a lot for himself, even the function of "Huan Zhen" was unlocked.</p><p></p><p>No wonder when he saw the Eternal Legacy before, Li Fan felt waves of hunger through "Huan Zhen."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately started to carefully study this so-called "Transmutation."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, his brows furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Consumes 100% of the Transmutation’s energy progress, abandons the physical body's existence, and completely entrusts one's true spirit to an item..."</p><p></p><p>"After becoming an item, one cannot retain autonomous consciousness, only leaving behind a bit of 'spirit.'”</p><p></p><p>"Correspondingly, the duration of preservation will greatly increase."</p><p></p><p>"When the preservation period reaches its limit, it will automatically trigger the 'Huan Zhen' function to return to a pre-set anchor point."</p><p></p><p>"...”</p><p></p><p>"What's the use of this?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was initially somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>However, after careful consideration, he vaguely thought of the usage of "Transmutation."</p><p></p><p>At the most basic level, even when nearing the end of one's life span in this world, one can still remain in the world by transforming into an object to gather information.</p><p></p><p>Although the specific details of many events may not be known very clearly.</p><p></p><p>But for the future direction of the world, as long as it is entrusted to reliable individuals, it should not be difficult to grasp.</p><p></p><p>And according to the feedback from "Huan Zhen," at present, if Li Fan activates the "Transmutation," it would be enough to extend for nearly three thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Even though the duration may be shortened due to damage to the transformed object, it would significantly enhance Li Fan's foresight for the future.</p><p></p><p>Thus, he could make better arrangements for the next life.</p><p></p><p>In the passage of time, those who can leave their mark in history are undoubtedly not ordinary individuals.</p><p></p><p>They could truly be called heroes.</p><p></p><p>Take note of their names, and when the opportunity arises, invest in them again.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Li Fan's previous slow process of gathering talents through personal contacts and information, particularly in a province, this method would be much more efficient.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's interest was sparked.</p><p></p><p>"For instance, in this world, what will the Xuanhuang Realm look like under the Xuantian Lock-Spirit Array? Perhaps this could be understood through this..."</p><p></p><p>With caution, Li Fan once again confirmed the many details of the "Transmutation."</p><p></p><p>"'Transforming the self into an object' and 'turning the real into the virtual' are powers of the same level. After transforming into an object, as long as one cannot resist the 'Huan Zhen's' power of transmutation, then the slight true spirit entrusted in the object cannot be distinguished."</p><p></p><p>"After transforming into an object, the energy progress of 'Transmutation' will continue to increase automatically, with the upper limit raised to 1000%. This greatly enhances self-defense capabilities."</p><p></p><p>"In addition to reaching the limit of duration, when the transformed object encounters the danger of complete destruction, the automatic return of 'Huan Zhen' will also be triggered."</p><p></p><p>…</p><p></p><p>Before long, Li Fan made a decision.</p><p></p><p>The safety of the "Transmutation" function was indeed guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>"Given that my lifespan in this world is almost over, and with my identity as a constructor of the Xuantian Lock-Spirit Array, even if I can live a few more years, my freedom will be restricted. It is better to transform into an object, like a cicada shedding its shell, and quietly watch the changes in the world."</p><p></p><p>"However, before that, I need to choose a transmutation object and a person to entrust it to."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan surveyed the storage ring he wore.</p><p></p><p>His gaze stopped on a crystal-clear round plate.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Break Array Jade Plate,' a special item made by the Ten Immortals Alliance for high-level array masters to break formations."</p><p></p><p>"It was a reward for being in the top one hundred before the final assessment at the Universal Academy."</p><p></p><p>"However, in these years, busy constructing the Xuantian Lock-Spirit Array, this item has not been of much use."</p><p></p><p>"Compared to other items of unknown origin, this artifact produced by the Ten Immortals Alliance would certainly raise less suspicion."</p><p></p><p>"The next consideration is how to deliver this Break Array Jade Plate to the designated person."</p><p></p><p>In a secret chamber, Li Fan pondered carefully.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, Li Fan received messages from Huang Fu Song, Qi Buyi, and even Ji Hongdao.</p><p></p><p>They asked when he would come out of the Museum of Divine Treasures.</p><p></p><p>They urged him to go directly to the headquarters of the Ten Immortals Alliance's array hall after coming out, as the reward for ranking second on the Golden List was ready for him to collect at any time.</p><p></p><p>In addition, longevity treasures were also prepared, waiting for his arrival.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan only sneered at the messages, choosing not to reply.</p><p></p><p>In the Museum of Divine Treasures, there was an area called the "Realm of Xuanhuang Myriad Phenomena."</p><p></p><p>Inside, there was a sample of every living being within the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the existence of an immortal monument above the Xuanhuang Realm that devoured everything, Li Fan had a vague guess when he visited.</p><p></p><p>This so-called "Museum of Divine Treasures," rather than being similar to a regular museum, seemed more like a place to preserve the seeds of civilization.</p><p></p><p>If the Xuanhuang Realm truly faced destruction one day, this place might bear the hope of preserving the seeds of civilization and rebuilding the future.</p><p></p><p>Later, when he inquired with the guide Bing Yin, it turned out as he suspected.</p><p></p><p>The position of the Divine Treasures Museum was extremely special, and all disputes were prohibited inside.</p><p></p><p>Even the array hall did not have the authority to forcefully take people away.</p><p></p><p>As long as Li Fan stayed inside and did not go out, Ji Hongdao and the others would have no way to force him.</p><p></p><p>Before activating the "Transmutation," Li Fan checked the situation of his clone.</p><p></p><p>Han Yi had explored the ruins of Tiantu with hope.</p><p></p><p>Not only did they find nothing, but they also encountered many inexplicable dangers along the way.</p><p></p><p>Both of them were seriously injured and returned to the Source Road City to recuperate.</p><p></p><p>On the way back, Han Yi couldn’t help but look at Li Fan’s clone Xiaofan with suspicion, hesitating several times to speak.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity. I thought I could gain something through this person's luck,” Li Fan thought, shaking his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>After that, he manipulated the clone to return alone to the ruins of Tiantu that had been explored before.</p><p></p><p>He found a restriction, took the initiative to die, and ended the life of the clone.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"By doing this, I can proceed with the next plan."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes shimmered.</p><p></p><p>With the activation of "Transmutation," a trace of true spirit was invested into the "Break Array Jade Plate" in the storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's consciousness suddenly darkened.</p><p></p><p>And his aura also rapidly weakened.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, far away in Tianyun Prefecture, He Zhenghao, and in Tianyu Prefecture, Huang Fu Song, received messages from Li Fan before his death.</p><p></p><p>"A posthumous letter?"</p><p></p><p>Huang Fu Song's expression changed, filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>He immediately contacted Ji Hongdao.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, when Qi Buyi brought Huang Fu Song hurriedly arrived, what they saw was Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>"He just died like this?"</p><p></p><p>Huang Fu Song was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Qi Buyi, with a solemn expression, went forward to inspect for a moment and nodded.</p><p></p><p>The two looked at each other, both speechless.</p><p></p><p>"I noticed something off about him earlier. He said it was nothing, just needed some rest. Who knew..." Guide Bing Yin shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>Huang Fu Song asked through sound transmission, "What do we do now?"</p><p></p><p>"He's already dead, what else can we do?" Qi Buyi's face was indifferent. After giving him a glance, he turned and left.</p>

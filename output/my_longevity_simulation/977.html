        <h1>Chapter 977</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Upon hearing Lin Ling's description, Li Fan's wariness towards her diminished greatly.</p><p></p><p>Such an inconceivable matter...</p><p></p><p>It didn't seem like something she could fabricate.</p><p></p><p>Imagining the scene of Senior Shi Ban being "fished" away, even with Li Fan's current state of mind, he couldn't help but feel a chill down his spine.</p><p></p><p>When you gaze into the abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.</p><p></p><p>When you are fishing, how do you know that you won't be the one getting fished?</p><p></p><p>"The water in this peerless fishing pond that can connect the inside and outside of the high walls is a bit too deep."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment and decided that he couldn't just listen to Lin Ling's one-sided story. He had to go to the scene and take a look for himself.</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Li Fan concealed his tracks and hurried towards Yong Yun Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>When he arrived at the small temple, whether it was Zhong Shentong, Liu Li, or Lin Ling, they obviously hadn't recovered from the great terror of Senior Shi Ban's sudden disappearance.</p><p></p><p>Their faces were pale and they were restless.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you're here." Seeing Li Fan's arrival, Lin Ling seemed to have found a backbone and hurriedly stepped forward to greet him.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong also slightly composed himself and bowed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan just slightly nodded, then strode to where the fishing pond originally was.</p><p></p><p>The once tranquil pool of water was now reduced to complete nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Congyu Sea after being annihilated by Mo Sha, it was pitch black.</p><p></p><p>Even the space itself no longer existed.</p><p></p><p>The dangerous aura it exuded made Li Fan frown slightly and quietly take a step back.</p><p></p><p>"The fishing pond is indeed domineering, forming its own system. After occupying a region of the Xuanhuang Realm, it expelled all other laws in this place, or rather, directly squeezed and obliterated them."</p><p></p><p>"And with the disappearance of the fishing pond, the occupied area is revealed. It may take decades for the Xuanhuang Realm to repair before it can return to normal."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered while discerning the possible residual auras in this place.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Fan didn't have much hope, but to his surprise, he actually did discover something.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered, showing a disappointed expression on the surface as if he found nothing.</p><p></p><p>Then, using the danger of this place as an excuse, he took Lin Ling and the others back to the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>After settling them down, Li Fan quietly returned alone.</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes and concentrating, he recalled the feeling of merging with the Canghai Pearl, also in a state of worldview under the killing intent of nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Bits and pieces, appearing in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>A mottled scene presented in Li Fan's field of vision.</p><p></p><p>Outside the void gap left by the fishing pond, countless interwoven and barely perceptible thin lines were densely distributed.</p><p></p><p>It was as if there was an invisible loom weaving something in the void.</p><p></p><p>This scene was very similar to the picture Li Fan had seen in the [Root of Heaven and Earth] when the Five Elements Grotto Heaven was being created.</p><p></p><p>This was the way heaven and earth created things.</p><p></p><p>And what was being created at this moment...</p><p></p><p>"The Creation Stone Tablet." Li Fan suddenly opened his eyes, revealing an unusual color.</p><p></p><p>This object, which had already shown a rudimentary form, was clearly no different from the Creation Stone Tablet that Senior Shi Ban carried on his back, which was said to record everything in the Xuanhuang Realm since the beginning of time!</p><p></p><p>In addition to being shocked, Li Fan's thoughts turned rapidly, and he immediately deduced the reason why the Creation Stone Tablet appeared here again.</p><p></p><p>The Creation Stone Tablet was</p><p></p><p>The embodiment of the laws of the Xuanhuang Realm can be said to be the Xuanhuang Realm itself.</p><p></p><p>The world itself naturally cannot be fished away by the unknown existence deep within the fishing pool.</p><p></p><p>So although Senior Stone Tablet has disappeared, the Creation Stone Tablet he carried has been preserved due to the inertia of the world.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Senior has finally achieved his wish and regained his freedom."</p><p></p><p>"But I don't know what kind of scene is on the other side of the fishing pool."</p><p></p><p>Imagining the possible scenery outside the high walls, Li Fan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he shook his head and focused his attention on the increasingly obvious Creation Stone Tablet.</p><p></p><p>This stone tablet is undoubtedly the supreme treasure of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>As long as it is refined, countless secrets hidden in the Xuanhuang Realm will be laid out before Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>It might even be possible to ascend to the heavens in one step and directly attain immortality.</p><p></p><p>But it is an immortality deeply bound to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Fan clearly saw the pain suffered by Senior Stone Tablet, and even death was a relief in comparison...</p><p></p><p>More crucially, Li Fan was worried that this thing would have the effect of influencing the mind, just like Ruomu and Mr. Daobai.</p><p></p><p>Then there would be another "willing but unwilling" situation.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he would bear the stone tablet for all eternity...</p><p></p><p>"From the experience of fighting against Mr. Daobai, even avatars cannot be exempt from the influence on the mind."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that we need to find a suitable candidate to inherit this Creation Stone Tablet."</p><p></p><p>The figures of various cultivators rapidly changed in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew that he didn't have much time left.</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth re-weaving the Creation Stone Tablet is like a tree bearing fruit.</p><p></p><p>The moment the Creation Stone Tablet is fully formed is the instant the fruit falls to the ground.</p><p></p><p>It will probably return to somewhere in the Xuanhuang Realm and be difficult to find again.</p><p></p><p>"It's him."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan finally decided on the target candidate, and then with the seven-colored divine light protecting his body, he turned into a long rainbow and headed straight for the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he had already found the target cultivator.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than Sima Changkong, who used his own family's bloodline to record the history of the Xuanhuang Realm!</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong of this lifetime had no dealings with Li Fan, so he was a little surprised by Li Fan's sudden visit.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan was not here to ask for his opinion.</p><p></p><p>Without saying a word, he instantly subdued Sima Changkong. Then he took him and quickly returned to the small temple in Yongyun State.</p><p></p><p>On the way, he explained the cause of the matter.</p><p></p><p>"Now, there is an opportunity to fully understand the past of the Xuanhuang Realm before you. Are you willing to accept it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, for Sima Changkong, who had taken it upon himself to record the history of the Xuanhuang Realm for generations, there was absolutely no reason to refuse this matter.</p><p></p><p>Everything that was happening in the Xuanhuang Realm would always appear in his mind...</p><p></p><p>For Sima Changkong, this was not suffering at all!</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was an almost perfect ability that made people tremble with excitement, something the Sima family had always dreamed of!</p><p></p><p>At least, before truly absorbing the stone tablet, this was what Sima Changkong thought.</p><p></p><p>"Who else but me to compose the history of the Xuanhuang Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"I hope you will help me, fellow Daoist!"</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong took a deep breath and respectfully bowed to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know how the other party knew his identity, if what he said was true...</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong was willing to give everything for this!</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan agreed in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Wait for the right moment!"</p><p></p><p>Seven days later, when the Creation Stone Tablet was about to be fully formed, Li Fan shouted lightly and used the [Silk Pulling] divine ability on Sima Changkong.</p>

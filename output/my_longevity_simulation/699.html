        <h1>Chapter 699</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Even though he and Huangfu Song were both skilled in formations, they had to spend a long time discussing together before barely understanding this formation.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they merely understood it.</p><p></p><p>As for how the formation operated, how the dead energy and vitality transformed, it was somewhat beyond their comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"The theory of reversing life and death..."</p><p></p><p>"The culprit of Lan Yu's failed enlightenment, the cultivator who emerged from the white mist as if alive, is related to this formation?" Li Fan's heart trembled immensely.</p><p></p><p>While murmuring to himself, Huangfu Song said, "Death leads to the end of life and the dissipation of the Dao. How could there be a principle of death and resurrection? Unimaginable, unimaginable…"</p><p></p><p>Watching his two companions as if bewitched and still not coming to their senses after a long time, Dong Fangyao, who knew nothing about formations, felt irritated and anxious.</p><p></p><p>Finally unable to hold back, he shouted angrily to wake the two of them up.</p><p></p><p>"After studying for so long, do you have any conclusions?" he asked with a furrowed brow.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song shook his head and decisively replied, "In my opinion, even if the Chief of our Strategy Hall were to personally come here, it might not be possible to set up this formation. Such a vast and magnificent formation, completely unknown to the world, quietly hidden within the white mist domain..."</p><p></p><p>A hint of anxiety flashed across his face, "It seems like we have mistakenly entered into the arrangement of a grand figure who is currently 'enlightening eternal life.'"</p><p></p><p>"The white mist domain is vast, yet we happened to encounter the one containing this formation. I really don't know if it's lucky or unlucky," Huangfu Song said in a gloomy tone.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, it's not a coincidence. If there is more than one misty domain, could there be more formations like this?" Li Fan suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Huangfu Song froze in place. Then, he was even more shocked and dared not speak further.</p><p></p><p>In reality, Li Fan hid many things in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It was because he heard a murmur resembling that of the 'Heavenly Doctor' that he followed the source of the sound and found this misty domain.</p><p></p><p>In this domain, there was a great formation that could reverse life and death. In the previous life, a cultivator successfully reversed the theory of life and death, achieving the status of a new Eternal Supreme God.</p><p></p><p>All these things seemed to hint that the 'Heavenly Doctor' was behind everything.</p><p></p><p>It was also he who would ascend to become the Eternal Supreme God shortly after.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan still had some doubts in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, the formation in this misty domain was the vital key to the 'Heavenly Doctor' achieving eternal life. Such an important place should not allow even the slightest carelessness. How could they easily barge in?</p><p></p><p>"This complete lack of defense..."</p><p></p><p>"Is it a trap? Or perhaps the owner of this place simply does not care much about this formation. Or maybe, they are absolutely confident that even if someone enters by mistake, they wouldn't be able to affect the foundation of the formation?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly thought of the small wooden house at the top of the Great Profound Disconnection Mountain.</p><p></p><p>It was his rest and cultivation place while waiting for the True Energy to replenish. Just like this misty domain, it did not have any formation protections.</p><p></p><p>Only outside the Great Profound Disconnection Mountain, there was a layer of illusion set up to prevent ordinary people from entering.</p><p></p><p>Because Li Fan believed that it was unnecessary.</p><p></p><p>"Do I view ordinary people as she views cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>"Is she the Heavenly Doctor?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't determine that either.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan asked himself, even if he was facing ordinary people, if it was related to his promotion, out of caution, he would certainly take measures to be prepared.</p><p></p><p>"And yet, she simply didn't do so..."</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was still puzzled, a statement by Dong Fangyao unintentionally enlightened him.</p><p></p><p>"Huangfu, I think what you said is somewhat incorrect. Although we don't understand the intricacies of this formation, if you say it can reverse life and death, wouldn't the predecessor who set up this formation be even more capable of doing so?"</p><p></p><p>"Without understanding the principles, how could the formation be set up? Reversing the theory of life and death is already a method of an Eternal Supreme God, right? Why have I never heard of the name of this Supreme God before?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly realized, "That's right. I originally thought that the owner of this place was trying to achieve the reversal of life and death through this formation. But it's also possible that she herself has already achieved this. Then this place…"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked around.</p><p></p><p>"It's not a place of enlightenment. It's a test ground after achieving enlightenment!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts quickly turned.</p><p></p><p>"After achieving eternal life, the laws of heaven and earth also change. Logically speaking, with just a thought, these frozen cultivators could be brought back to life. But she went a step further and set up another formation..."</p><p></p><p>"What is she researching? Achieving eternal life is not enough for her; she wants to go a step further?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze turned to the formation eye of the reversal of life and death that he had found earlier.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the answer lies there."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said in a deep voice, "This predecessor is probably already an Eternal Supreme God. She has already abandoned this place, so we can easily enter. There shouldn't be any danger in leaving from the formation eye. Let's move quickly."</p><p></p><p>With that said, without waiting for Huangfu and the others to react, he flew towards the formation eye.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song and Dong Fangyao were slightly stunned upon hearing this, but they felt that Li Fan's words made sense, so they quickly followed.</p><p></p><p>In no time, they arrived at the center of the grand formation, where the dead energy was most intense.</p><p></p><p>The strange beast that had just disappeared in the silent black sea was right here.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the progress bar showing a 200% charging status, shaking his head and saying, "It's a case of making a decision without hesitation and bearing the consequences. We have thoroughly explored this place, and lingering here will be of no use. Do you still want to comprehend this grand formation of reversing life and death and then break free from it? Instead of waiting to die, it's better to take a risk!"</p><p></p><p>With that, an extremely dense wood elemental spirit power surrounded his whole body.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me!" Li Fan coldly shouted and dove headfirst into the dead sea.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that things had come to this, Huangfu and Dong Fangyao could only grit their teeth and follow.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the seawater, the unimaginable aura of death soon swept over them from all directions. Like countless worms, it gnawed at and absorbed Li Fan's vitality. This sensation was very similar to that of the soul-devouring white mist.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had personally experienced the passage of life force to near exhaustion in the white mist, was not unfamiliar with it.</p><p></p><p>He did not panic much and quickly took out five Longevity Pills and threw them into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>As the effects of the pills burst forth, Li Fan forced out the longevity essence contained in the pills, forming a protective shield to resist the erosion of the dead energy.</p><p></p><p>With his escape technique reaching its peak, he rapidly dove deep into the pitch-black seabed.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, he was on the verge of reaching the seafloor.</p><p></p><p>With narrowed eyes, Li Fan seemed to sense a tiny whirlpool ahead.</p><p></p><p>Within the whirlpool, a hint of vitality appeared.</p><p></p><p>"That's it!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan concentrated his mind, transforming into a beam of light and rushing into the whirlpool.</p><p></p><p>The next moment...</p><p></p><p>After a slight dizziness, he was welcomed by brightness in front of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The slightly intoxicating sea breeze, the salty damp air, and the occasional calls of birds...</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan could clearly see the scenery before him, he had already arrived above a vast blue ocean.</p>

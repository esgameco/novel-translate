            <p>Chapter 1001: The Tianxuan Mirror Establishes Its Dao</p><p></p><p>"I've seen quite a few people like you." </p><p></p><p>"But most of them didn't live for long and died miserably due to various reasons."</p><p></p><p>"I'm a bit curious, how have you managed to live well until now?"</p><p></p><p>The Tianxuan Mirror's avatar spoke bluntly, showing no respect for Li Fan. Its eyes were full of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face twitched. Killing intent suddenly surfaced in his heart. </p><p></p><p>However, thinking that the other party was, after all, the avatar of the Tianxuan Mirror and knew countless secrets, which might contain the key to breaking the situation...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had to forcibly suppress his murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, right. Ordinary methods of soul searching and refining magic treasures won't work on me."</p><p></p><p>"If there's something I don't want to talk about, no one in this Xuanhuang Realm can force me." The Tianxuan Mirror's avatar glanced at Li Fan again and explained in advance.</p><p></p><p>"Your tone is not small..." Although Li Fan said this, he didn't doubt these words.</p><p></p><p>After all, neither the former Xuantian King nor the later Chuanfa Tianzun seemed to have fully controlled this magic tool.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had also thought of trying the [Xuantian Sealing Spirit] formation, but from the time he had been in contact with the Tianxuan Mirror's avatar, this avatar had completely separated from the Tianxuan Mirror and was a thoroughly independent individual existence.</p><p></p><p>The formations targeting the Tianxuan Mirror were useless on it.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell are you now?" Li Fan deliberately said disgustingly. </p><p></p><p>The Tianxuan Mirror's avatar was not angered, but instead showed a rare hint of smugness on its face.</p><p></p><p>"Possessing the weight of a tool and the spirit of a human."</p><p></p><p>"Perfect and flawless, almost a true immortal..."</p><p></p><p>Before it could finish speaking, Li Fan was heard sarcastically saying, "So it's a mongrel."</p><p></p><p>The expression on the Tianxuan Mirror's avatar's face suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>But it quickly returned to normal, looked at Li Fan, and shook its head slightly, saying, "As the saying goes, a summer insect cannot understand ice."</p><p></p><p>"But then again, if you had the opportunity to complete a transformation like mine, I'm afraid you would make the same choice as me." The Tianxuan Mirror's avatar said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not respond and remained silent.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he finally uttered a sentence: "It seems that you really are not afraid of death."</p><p></p><p>The Tianxuan Mirror's avatar laughed contentedly: "You've also seen through it. The methods of living beings are ever-changing. Since I want to experience a complete human life, naturally I must also experience birth, aging, sickness, and death."</p><p></p><p>"After this body dies, naturally there will be another body born."</p><p></p><p>"Unless you can destroy my true form, otherwise, how can you truly kill me?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully savored these words, and after a while, he slowly said, "It seems that you have not just split out a human body, but have walked out your own [Dao]."</p><p></p><p>The Tianxuan Mirror's avatar applauded happily, as if it had finally met a confidant.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the plan to kill the avatar and cut off your retreat is doomed to fail."</p><p></p><p>The Tianxuan Mirror's avatar smiled: "I pondered for nearly ten thousand years before finding such a way to transcend. If it was so simple that it could be broken just by finding and killing the avatar..."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't that underestimating me a bit too much?"</p><p></p><p>The smile on the Tianxuan Mirror's avatar's face suddenly disappeared. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, it finally displayed the domineering aura of a magic tool.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that all the cultivators in the world have underestimated you. But you..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Why did you tell me this crucial secret so bluntly? Aren't you afraid I'll spread it?" Li Fan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Tianxuan Mirror clone also narrowed his eyes, imitating Li Fan: "Pulling out a hair to benefit the world, you wouldn't do it. Such a crucial secret, how could you easily spread it? You'd definitely want something in return..."</p><p></p><p>"Besides, since I chose to tell you, naturally I'm not worried about any impact on me if it really leaks. Once my Dao is accomplished, what is there to fear?" </p><p></p><p>Seeing the Tianxuan Mirror's narrowed eyes, Li Fan's expression suddenly returned to normal: "Actually, I think the cold mechanical voice of the original body suits you better." Li Fan suggested earnestly.</p><p></p><p>The smug look on the Tianxuan Mirror clone's face instantly vanished.</p><p></p><p>"I was originally planning to tell you some news you might be interested in when I was in a good mood. But now it seems there's no chance of that. Go ahead and kill me." The Tianxuan Mirror clone said coldly, looking fearless.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan still did not make a move.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, strictly speaking, you and I are the same kind of people." After a moment of silence and some pondering, Li Fan said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"You originated from the immortal realm. Even if the immortal realm suffered a great calamity causing you to fall to the lower realm, an immortal artifact is still incomparable to ordinary cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"So you've never really taken the masses of the Xuanhuang realm seriously. Even if temporarily controlled, ten thousand years is but a fleeting moment to you."</p><p></p><p>"You've found a way to break free from control."</p><p></p><p>"In high spirits, you roam the mortal world. Others think you're comprehending the Dao, but in fact you're enjoying the joy of achieving the Dao."</p><p></p><p>"The so-called imitation of humans is also a way for you to play. You observe the mortal world with a mocking heart, but never truly intend to integrate."</p><p></p><p>"Because they are unworthy."</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's words, the Tianxuan Mirror clone's face grew solemn. </p><p></p><p>He did not interrupt Li Fan's speech, quietly listening attentively.</p><p></p><p>"The difference between immortals and mortals is like that between heaven and an abyss. Even if you're just an immortal artifact, you still have the word 'immortal'. I think it must be different from us cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"The other trifles and changes of this world, you probably don't care about."</p><p></p><p>"Because as an immortal artifact, you've already transcended time. Even if tens of thousands more years pass and the Xuanhuang realm is turned upside down, or even if the Xuanhuang realm falls into the immortal ruins, it likely won't cause you any substantial harm."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After such a long speech, and with Li Fan looking like he could go on endlessly, the Tianxuan Mirror clone finally seemed a bit impatient. </p><p></p><p>He asked, "What exactly are you trying to say?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately shut his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Then he suddenly laughed, "What am I trying to say?"</p><p></p><p>"Or what do you not want to hear?"</p><p></p><p>"Everything I said was just a probe."</p><p></p><p>"I was probing what you truly care about. And I was very lucky to find that answer."</p><p></p><p>The Tianxuan Mirror clone no longer had his previous unrestrained appearance.</p><p></p><p>"I want to know, if the Xuanhuang realm really falls into the immortal ruins..."</p><p></p><p>"Will the original Tianxuan Mirror really be affected?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan asked earnestly, his smile fading.</p><p></p><p>"You..." The Tianxuan Mirror clone's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you good at reading people? If I say I can, and am willing, to drag the Xuanhuang realm into the immortal ruins with me..."</p><p></p><p>"Do you think it's true or not?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan asked very calmly.</p>

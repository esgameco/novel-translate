        <h1>Chapter 453</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After saying that, he threw a communication talisman to Jiao Xiuyuan and left without mentioning anything about leaving a receipt. </p><p></p><p>"This guy seems to be quite trusting of me," Jiao Xiuyuan muttered softly, shaking the broken illusion stone in his hand.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the stone eye disappeared into thin air, its destination unknown.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the puppet on Wanxian Island reverted back to its previous lazy appearance.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan would never have thought that it wasn't Li Fan trusting him so much, but rather that the broken illusion stone was merely a way for Li Fan to establish a connection with him. Even if he couldn't sell it or even embezzled it, it didn't matter to Li Fan. What Li Fan truly cared about was the "big business" down the line.</p><p></p><p>Back in the Tianxuan Mirror, Li Fan remembered another object he discovered in the ruins of the Tianji Sect.</p><p></p><p>It was a whole stone tower that he had cut and brought back.</p><p></p><p>His initial hunch was correct.</p><p></p><p>After examination with the Tianxuan Mirror, the entire stone tower turned out to be a magical object called the "[Heaven and Earth Fate Dice]."</p><p></p><p>When mortals roll the dice, they get numbers like five or six. </p><p></p><p>However, when cultivators roll the dice, they receive the fate number.</p><p></p><p>Ancient cultivators of the Tianji Sect relied on this Heaven and Earth Fate Dice, using sufficient information as a basis and qi mechanism sensing as power to deduce countless possibilities in the future.</p><p></p><p>The reason Li Fan saw only emptiness was because the Heaven and Earth Fate Dice was frozen in the scene it had finished deducing in those years.</p><p></p><p>"A void."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what the ancient Tianji Sect cultivators were deducing. To actually obtain such a result."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan extended his hand, and a crystal-clear regular icosahedron die appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Each side of the die seemed to flicker different images upon closer inspection.</p><p></p><p>Even though Li Fan had tried several times before to use the Heaven and Earth Fate Dice to predict the future, to see if it matched what he had experienced, he only received fragmented and incomprehensible images, which proved to be of little practical use.</p><p></p><p>Despite this, Li Fan did not sell it. He always had a feeling that keeping it might be useful in the future.</p><p></p><p>After playing with it for a while, Li Fan put away the Heaven and Earth Fate Dice and shifted his focus to his clone, Zhou Qing'ang.</p><p></p><p>He had been staying on Taian Island these days, occasionally contacting necessary individuals through communication talismans.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't just idleness but rather his research on overcoming the side effects of the "[Devouring the Heavens and Earth Great Technique]."</p><p></p><p>This secret technique might have been based on the ancient beast, the Return-to-Origin Clam. Though it indeed possessed the ability to devour heaven and earth, it also made the mind extremely vulnerable, ultimately either killing oneself or attracting attention and getting killed.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, Li Fan possessed the power to keep himself in an absolutely rational state. It was the power of the Blue Flame from the Illusionary Spirit Visualization.</p><p></p><p>Not seeking to maintain calm throughout the process of devouring heaven and earth but only to withdraw at critical moments.</p><p></p><p>With the enhancement of the Enlightenment Pill and the Awakening State, Li Fan had exerted much effort and finally succeeded in achieving this.</p><p></p><p>However, to increase his cultivation through the Devouring the Heavens and Earth Great Technique, he still needed to address the issues of solidified veins and absorption blockages.</p><p></p><p>In preparation for this, Li Fan had already planned ahead.</p><p></p><p>Concealing his form, he teleported to the Western Lingmu Island in the Congyun Sea before continuing westward by flight.</p><p></p><p>After about five hundred miles, Li Fan quietly sneaked into the sea.</p><p></p><p>Delving deep into the seabed and searching for a while, he indeed found the remnants of a sunken island.</p><p></p><p>In the previous lifetime, soon after, this island would resurface due to inexplicable changes in the veins and the reactivation of the island protection array would attract the attention of the various array masters of the Congyun Sea Formation Hall.</p><p></p><p>However, before any of this happened, it appeared no different from the other remnants scattered across the seabed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan arrived amidst the ruins and patiently waited.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later, the seabed began to tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Here we go!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself as he vigorously stomped his feet, causing his body to sink instantaneously.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he activated the [Devouring the Heavens and Earth Great Technique], sensing a continuously surging power from an unknown distance through the veins.</p><p></p><p>The once depleted veins slowly reactivated under the influence of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>If there were no other external interferences, the rekindled vitality within the veins would force the sunken island back to the surface.</p><p></p><p>However, with Li Fan's presence, this phenomenon would not occur.</p><p></p><p>Under his feet, a massive whirlpool emerged. The surging power of the veins, yet to take shape, was all absorbed by Li Fan and transformed into pure spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Not from the technique that the spy Zhou Qing'ang cultivated, but from Li Fan's other cultivation method derived from the Tianji Sect, the "Heavenly Intent Radiant Gem Technique."</p><p></p><p>Originally, this ancient technique progressed very slowly. However, under the unrestricted acceleration effect provided by the Devouring the Heavens and Earth Great Technique, it was advancing at a terrifying speed.</p><p></p><p>The power from the veins kept flowing endlessly, and Li Fan's clone voraciously absorbed it without reservation.</p><p></p><p>Already at the bottleneck of the early Golden Core stage, his clone's cultivation advanced rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Due to the existence of the "Heaven's Calamity," he could not progress further even with the accelerated rotation of the technique.</p><p></p><p>Frowning slightly, Li Fan did not cease his devouring actions.</p><p></p><p>Even if all the power he devoured now would be wasted, he didn't mind at all.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power transformed from the Devouring the Heavens and Earth Great Technique continued to accumulate within his clone, completely filling every part of its body.</p><p></p><p>As the clone was about to burst, Li Fan slapped his chest, causing a burst of suction to release the excess spiritual power and transform it.</p><p></p><p>During the ancient times without the "Heaven's Calamity," situations like the one Li Fan was in now wouldn't have occurred. The acquisition of spiritual power would lag behind the speed of cultivation advancement.</p><p></p><p>However, the existence of cultivation bottlenecks had left Li Fan devouring power, trapped in a weird situation.</p><p></p><p>The transformed power from devouring was being used to hasten the cultivation of the technique, yet he still couldn't progress.</p><p></p><p>The technique's rotation had accelerated to a terrifying speed, like a surging tide relentlessly assaulting an extremely sturdy barrier.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully observed and recorded everything happening within his clone's body.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the majestic power of the veins, the strength of a mere Golden Core cultivator was insignificant.</p><p></p><p>But this power, which should have at least allowed the Golden Core cultivator to ascend to the Nascent Soul stage, was being constantly depleted during the challenge of the Heaven's Calamity.</p><p></p><p>Nonetheless, Li Fan's efforts were not in vain.</p>

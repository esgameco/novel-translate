            <p>"Actually, I have a premonition. New 69 Book Bar 89shux.com"</p><p></p><p>"Even if we cultivators do nothing, this mortal miasma will never eradicate cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"At most, it will reduce the overall number of cultivators to a certain level. It can be said that killing intent and compassion coexist."</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Master Yin ended this communication with such a statement.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem."</p><p></p><p>After pondering, Li Fan inquired about the situation and encounters of mortals under the outbreak of this mutated mortal miasma.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because the mortals in the world still had mortal miasma within their bodies.</p><p></p><p>This disaster, which could be considered a terrifying calamity for cultivators, had a limited impact on mortals.</p><p></p><p>The casualties were even less than those of common influenza.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, these mortals are now considered subjects under the rule of the Immortal Alliance. Otherwise, there might be incidents like in ancient times, where cultivators on the verge of death and despair would massacre mortals on a large scale."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know how the Immortal Alliance will deal with the aftermath this time. Will this mutated mortal miasma be absorbed into the bodies of mortals again, lingering and not dissipating? And then another great migration?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts surged.</p><p></p><p>Although his body was in distress, it did not affect the agility of his thinking at all.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that for mortals, this mortal miasma is equivalent to a protective talisman. However, if one is determined to seek immortality and embark on the Dao, then they are on the opposite side of mortals and must abandon this protective talisman."</p><p></p><p>"Immortals and mortals cannot coexist..."</p><p></p><p>In the current Xuanhuang Realm, there were still only two conventional methods to remove the miasma from one's body. New 69 Book Bar → 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>The [Purifying Spirit Pool] invented by the Eastern Supreme Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>And the Xuanhuang Heart-Cleansing Mantra.</p><p></p><p>These two methods were only suitable for removing the innate miasma of mortals.</p><p></p><p>They were useless for cultivators who were infected later in life.</p><p></p><p>"Although they are both called mortal miasma, their manifestations are different."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but frown slightly.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he gave up thinking.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, professional matters should be left to professionals."</p><p></p><p>"I believe the resurgence of the mortal miasma in this world will also help Master Yin's research. It should be possible to uncover the secrets of the mortal miasma ahead of the scheduled time."</p><p></p><p>"No rush, just wait."</p><p></p><p>Now that the states were sealed off and cultivators were in danger, everything had come to a standstill.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took this opportunity to cultivate diligently.</p><p></p><p>Devour the Five Elements Grand Heavenly Cave and re-enter the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p></p><p>Even without relying on the cultivation feedback from the «Sitting Immortal Technique», based on Li Fan's own cultivation and previous experience, the speed was much faster than when he started from scratch back then.</p><p></p><p>He was not far from perfecting his Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>The scene of Li Fan persisting in cultivation despite his illness deeply touched Lin Ling, Tian Yang, and Shang Tianci in the Lingmu Realm. New 69 Book Bar 89SHUX.COM</p><p></p><p>They felt ashamed.</p><p></p><p>They reduced their daily leisure time and learned to be diligent.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and half a year after the outbreak of the mutated mortal miasma, things finally took a turn.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance invented a special elixir. After taking it, cultivators could greatly alleviate the symptoms of pain.</p><p></p><p>Even those cultivators who had not yet been infected could take it in advance. Although it could not completely immunize against the effects of the mortal miasma, it could greatly reduce the probability of cultivators dying from the disease.</p><p></p><p>It could be called a panacea.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this time the Myriad Immortals Alliance was uncharacteristically generous.</p><p></p><p>Not only were all immortals</p><p></p><p>Sure, here's the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Alliance cultivators can receive it for free.</p><p></p><p>Even those scattered cultivators who don't join the Immortal Alliance enjoy this treatment.</p><p></p><p>For a time, the cultivators were grateful and appreciated the generosity of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, quite a few cultivators who previously held prejudices against the Myriad Immortal Alliance chose to join the Myriad Immortal Alliance on the spot after receiving treatment.</p><p></p><p>With the special elixir, the cultivators gradually recovered.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance even sent out cultivators to purify the world again and dispel the immortal miasma that pervaded the world.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan, who had already recovered, stared at the so-called "special elixir" in his hand and narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He had already swallowed one before.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the slight symptoms of being infected by the immortal miasma appearing in his body again,</p><p></p><p>There was also a feeling of comfort, as if his soul was soaking in a hot spring, giving him a feeling of wanting to ascend to immortality.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"The Pill of Ascending to Immortality with Sincerity?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression was a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>During the 115th world, he had taken this kind of elixir that was banned by the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Although it was greatly weakened, the feeling of taking this special medicine was definitely not much different from the Pill of Ascending to Immortality with Sincerity.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan was not proficient in pharmacology, he could also see how this special elixir worked.</p><p></p><p>That is, it accelerates the process of the immortal miasma erupting in the cultivator's body, while suppressing the pain brought about by the infection with a strong sense of excitement.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Immortal Alliance has a rule that each cultivator can only take one pill at most."</p><p></p><p>"If you eat too much, it's really hard to say how things will develop."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully screened his own thoughts, and at the same time looked at the elixir in his hand again.</p><p></p><p>He made sure that there was no strong desire in his heart to take it again.</p><p></p><p>"It's just one pill, it's not a big deal."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the number of cultivator deaths may be a bit high."</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Immortal Alliance is obviously using an emergency method, and they have no choice but to take it out."</p><p></p><p>"However, being able to stabilize the situation first is also considered a good remedy."</p><p></p><p>Crushing the special elixir in his hand into powder, Li Fan closed his eyes and enveloped the Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven below with his spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>After half a year of bitter cultivation, he was infinitely close to completing his Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>He was only one step away from opening the path to devour the Grotto-Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had a premonition in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This time, there will still be no Heavenly Tribulation!</p><p></p><p>He just needs to wait quietly.</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elements Great Grotto-Heaven is vast, and it will take at least two or three years."</p><p></p><p>"The matters of the Myriad Worlds United Association have Tian Yang and Lin Ling to take care of them, so they won't fall into a state of stagnation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered like this, while at the same time sweeping his spiritual consciousness over every scene of the Five Elements Grotto-Heaven, perfectly mapping them in his mind.</p><p></p><p>One year after the outbreak of the mutated immortal miasma.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators have become accustomed to its existence.</p><p></p><p>After all, basically all the cultivators have been infected once.</p><p></p><p>Those who really couldn't survive have already returned to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The rest have already developed sufficient immunity to it.</p><p></p><p>Although there are occasional cases of cultivators being re-infected, after all, that is only a minority.</p><p></p><p>It can't affect the overall situation!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the second batch of special elixirs from the Myriad Immortal Alliance has been successfully developed and is being distributed to various cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The haze of the immortal miasma has gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Congyu Sea, Haixuan Island.</p><p></p><p>"It's really like a different world!"</p><p></p><p>The island, which had been closed for a year, was reopened.</p><p></p><p>After taking two rounds of the special medicine, it only took a little more than half a day for the effects brought about by the immortal miasma to dissipate.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao and the others breathed the fresh spiritual energy and couldn't help but sigh.</p>

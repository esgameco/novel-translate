        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1128: Anchoring with the Emperor's Qi</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Li Fan was no longer the mortal Taishi who had just entered the world of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After multiple reincarnations, he had already grasped many secrets of the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Scenes from the past flashed rapidly through his mind, and he quickly found a feasible countermeasure.</p><p></p><p>"In order to minimize the possibility of being detected by the Faceless True Immortal, it's best not to have a significant change in my own cultivation level. But I also need to increase my strength as much as possible, that is, my [existence] in the world..."</p><p></p><p>"The Emperor's Qi Canon."</p><p></p><p>A secret manual that did not belong to the Xuanhuang Realm suddenly appeared in Li Fan's sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>This was a peerless and extraordinary technique that Senior Stone Tablet had fished out from the fishing pool.</p><p></p><p>Senior Stone Tablet was not interested in it and casually threw it to Li Fan at that time.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it became the most suitable lifeline for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor's Qi Canon could establish a worldly emperor, gathering the qi of the people and the dynasty. Without cultivation, one could become as powerful as a Longevity Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Although it would take hundreds of years and more than ten generations of people working together to become a Longevity Realm expert, Li Fan did not expect to reach the highest level of the Emperor's Qi Canon.</p><p></p><p>He only needed to gather the qi of the people to help him overcome the current crisis.</p><p></p><p>"There's no time to waste. The cultivation level of Foundation Establishment late-stage is enough to sweep the world."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood on the peak of Jieli Mountain, gazing at Xuanjing City from afar.</p><p></p><p>His figure floated and disappeared at an extreme speed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three days later, a piece of news spread throughout the world.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Daxuan was fatuous and unrighteous, incurring the wrath of heaven and the people.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Heavenly Destined Sacred Emperor descended to the world, executing the fatuous ruler, killing the treacherous officials, reopening the prosperous era, and recreating the universe.</p><p></p><p>It sounded incredible, but after a few days of chaos, the officials and people of Daxuan quickly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>After all, since ancient times, the imperial power did not reach the countryside. No matter how much it changed at the top, those who truly controlled the world were still the same group of people.</p><p></p><p>This was what the people of Daxuan initially thought.</p><p></p><p>However, not long after, the extraordinary aspects of this Heavenly Destined Sacred Emperor gradually became apparent.</p><p></p><p>Overnight, towering platforms rose from the ground in various parts of Daxuan.</p><p></p><p>No one knew how these hundred-zhang-tall structures came into existence, but the existence of these "Sacred Emperor Seats" completely changed the ecology of official positions in the Daxuan Empire.</p><p></p><p>Because these Sacred Emperor Seats could project the image of the Heavenly Destined Sacred Emperor onto the sky.</p><p></p><p>Every commoner, even those living in remote mountains, could listen to the Sacred Emperor's teachings through these Sacred Emperor Seats that were distributed throughout the empire.</p><p></p><p>What was even more terrifying to the officials in various places was that these Sacred Emperor Seats actually had the function of connecting to the capital.</p><p></p><p>However, not long after the construction of the Sacred Emperor Seats, a team of imperial guards walked out from them, bringing a large amount of food to provide disaster relief.</p><p></p><p>While saving countless people, this incident instantly spread throughout the world via the Sacred Emperor Seats.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Sacred Emperor's envoys successively walked out of the Sacred Emperor Seats and summoned officials from various places, which also proved the authenticity of the disaster relief event.</p><p></p><p>The fact that the Heavenly Destined Sacred Emperor was a reincarnation of an immortal and had displayed various divine powers in the court also became known to everyone in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>"All the people can pray to the great Heavenly Destined Sacred Emperor through the Sacred Emperor Seats. Any local officials who are fatuous or corrupt will be severely punished once verified." This was what the Sacred Emperor's envoy said to...</p><p></p><p>The teachings of the people of Da Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Don't think you can simply die and be done with it. The methods of the Heavenly Mandate's Holy Emperor are beyond your imagination. The hundreds of fat pigs tied up at the vegetable market in Xuan Jing City were the officials who previously exploited the people. Now, they are still writing confessions every day with their pig trotters. I have come this time to take you to appreciate it." This was the warning given by the Holy Emperor's envoy to the officials of Da Xuan.</p><p></p><p>And after the officials of Da Xuan collectively visited the vegetable market in the capital, they all turned extremely pale.</p><p></p><p>When they returned to their respective jurisdictions, they quickly became upright and strict in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Jing City.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan floated above the capital city, watching the dynasty's fortune slowly change from black to green, and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"By relying on the Holy Emperor's Throne to achieve a strong centralized power, the Da Xuan Dynasty has completed its transformation in a short period of time. Next, it is to slowly gather the hearts of the people and sublimate the fortune."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan observed his own body.</p><p></p><p>The lives of over a hundred million people in Da Xuan were now tied to him.</p><p></p><p>It was equivalent to a substantial "anchor" that fixed his existence.</p><p></p><p>His body was no longer as ethereal and transparent as a ghost.</p><p></p><p>However, it still occasionally reverted to that state of emptiness.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that it had not yet been completely stabilized.</p><p></p><p>"No big problem. As long as Da Xuan does not have any issues and becomes stronger and stronger, after another three years, it should be able to completely get rid of the side effects of [Void]."</p><p></p><p>"But it only solves the side effects. To truly break free from the True Immortal's Web, I still need to go to the Underworld to return to reality."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan lightly punched forward.</p><p></p><p>Without using his own Zhuji stage spiritual power, relying only on the dynasty's fortune gathered by the Emperor's Qi Canon.</p><p></p><p>The sound of air being torn apart rang out, and the white clouds in the distance were split apart.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the illusion of a green dragon faintly appeared in the air, roaring with its head raised.</p><p></p><p>"White, green, red, purple, gold."</p><p></p><p>"Now it is equivalent to an ordinary late Golden Core stage cultivator. The reason for such rapid cultivation is firstly because the foundation of Da Xuan is not bad, and it can barely be said to be in a feudal golden age. Secondly..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the towering Holy Emperor's Throne below.</p><p></p><p>"The methods of immortals are simply a dimensional attack for a mortal dynasty. Severely punishing a group of corrupt officials and solving disasters in various places. Then, proclaiming to the world through the Holy Emperor's Throne, the hearts of the people were almost instantly gathered."</p><p></p><p>"If it were an ordinary feudal mortal emperor, it would take at least more than ten years to achieve what I have done. And they would still have to face the counterattack of officials and local forces."</p><p></p><p>"I don't have to worry about these things."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Fan slowly descended from the clouds into the palace.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Holy Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Teacher!"</p><p></p><p>The guards in the courtyard immediately knelt down.</p><p></p><p>"You may rise." Li Fan raised his hand and helped them all up.</p><p></p><p>The faces of these young people instantly turned red with excitement.</p><p></p><p>They were all personally selected by Li Fan from various places in Da Xuan. In addition to undertaking the guard work of the imperial palace, their more important task was to kill officials in various places and deter villains. To maintain the prosperity and invincibility of the Da Xuan Dynasty's fortune.</p><p></p><p>And among them, the two who called Li Fan teacher were the two exceptionally talented youths named Sun Erlang and Wang Xuanba from the foot of Mount Jieli.</p><p></p><p>They were undertaking an even more important mission.</p><p></p><p>"Erlang, how is your cultivation of the [Sitting Immortal Technique] that I taught you?" </p><p></p><p>After dismissing the crowd, Li Fan looked at Sun Erlang and asked in a deep voice.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1340</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Faced with Li Fan's suggestion, Mo Rushen did not give an immediate answer. Instead, he remained silent, pondering for a long time. </p><p></p><p>Gazing at Li Fan, his gaze fell upon Li Fan's graying long hair. Perhaps it was because Li Fan spoke earnestly, and indeed did not have long to live, that in the end Mo Rushen nodded in agreement: "It's not impossible."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded happily: "Excellent! With the Dao brother's assistance, we'll be able to accomplish twice as much!"</p><p></p><p>"If so, then let us return to the Xuanhuang realm first!"</p><p></p><p>A sword shadow emerged from its sheath, and Li Fan extended his hand to invite Mo Rushen inside.</p><p></p><p>At first, Mo Rushen did not think much of it, but when he entered the shadow realm and felt its incredible speed, his expression eventually changed slightly. </p><p></p><p>The look in his eyes towards Li Fan became different.</p><p></p><p>And finally, after witnessing with his own eyes that under the protection of the shadow, the two of them could defy the gravitational pull of the celestial ruins and successfully descend into the Xuanhuang realm, Mo Rushen could no longer hold back and said: "It seems the Dao friend is indeed one of the most formidable figures of this era."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled wryly and shook his head: "Although I may be unmatched in this age, I cannot dominate all eternity. Moreover, no matter what magical arts I possess, my lifespan will still eventually expire. These divine abilities cannot surpass the heavens."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rushen opened his mouth but did not say anything further.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the two had descended into the Xuanhuang realm. Mo Rushen's divine consciousness silently swept over the world, and when he saw the vastly expanded domain, as well as the towering white mist barrier between heaven and earth, even this well-traveled Xuantian Sect King could not help but show a hint of astonishment in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he remarked with some emotion: "If I had not indeed sensed the lingering traces of the Floating Across Stars Formation, I would never have been able to connect this magnificent world before me with the ancient Xuanhuang realm."</p><p></p><p>"But in the span of tens of thousands of years, the changes to the world have only reached this point!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded and said: "When the world is about to be overturned, the changes of all things are a hundred thousand times faster than normal. I have observed these changes - their speed is like thunder, their swiftness like light. This is the heavenly way's self-preservation..."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan spoke, he casually projected an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Within the sphere of light, the Xuanhuang realm was in chaos, with the yin and yang out of balance; stars dimming, mountains and rivers shaking; plants withering, birds and beasts fleeing. It was very much the scene of the end of the world descending.</p><p></p><p>At the juncture of life and death, the Xuanhuang realm did indeed undergo various drastic transformations - ice sealing, heat stagnation, the passage of years, heavenly punishment and earthly destruction...</p><p></p><p>Mo Rushen was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>At the critical moment, Li Fan coughed lightly and withdrew the illusion sphere.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rushen was suddenly filled with a sense of profound loss.</p><p></p><p>He vaguely felt that the scene in that light sphere seemed to truly contain the principles of the transformations of heaven and earth - an unimaginable wealth for any cultivator. However, Li Fan had displayed it for too short a time, and Mo Rushen could not comprehend much.</p><p></p><p>And as the Xuantian Sect King and a revered senior of the ancient Xuanhuang realm, Mo Rushen's dignity prevented him from shamelessly asking Li Fan to display it again.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps after successfully finding Senior Xuanxuan and becoming more familiar..." Mo Rushen could not help but think.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the reason the Xuanhuang realm has become its current state, apart from the transformations of the heavenly way itself, is also due to the secret actions of the Chuanfa Celestial Lord," Li Fan continued frankly.</p><p></p><p>"The Chuanfa Celestial Lord was most likely once a venerable from the Celestial Laws Realm. With the destruction of the Celestial Laws Realm, the Chuanfa Celestial Lord wants to use the only remaining Xuanhuang realm in the stars to revive himself..."</p><p></p><p>"Chuanfa has comprehended the Dao in the stars for thousands of years. His strength is immeasurably profound - perhaps he has even reached the limits of mortality. I am no match for him!"</p><p></p><p>"We must act carefully and guard against this person. Any existence that could potentially threaten his revival of the Celestial Laws Realm, the Chuanfa Celestial Lord will definitely not let off." Li Fan sighed and advised sincerely.</p><p></p><p>"This Chuanfa is actually not a bad person. It's just a pity that he is destined to stand opposed to the Xuanhuang realm," Mo Rushen observed the other fragmented worlds incongruous with the Xuanhuang realm, and was somewhat convinced by Li Fan's words.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity..." In fact, Mo Rushen still had some positive feelings towards this figure who nominally destroyed the Ten Celestial Sects.</p><p></p><p>However, upon seeing the dismembered and reshaped state of the current Xuanhuang realm, and listening to Li Fan's soft narration, that already extremely faint positive feeling vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he frowned and said, "It seems the damage to the Floating Across Formation is indeed very severe. I can only vaguely sense its lingering aura, but cannot control it."</p><p></p><p>"Half is due to the passage of time, half is due to the great battles that occurred when the Ten Celestial Sects used the Floating Across Formation to capture other cultivation realms. The formation was increasingly damaged, yet the cultivators of the Ten Sects lacked the ability to repair it. Eventually leading to the complete destruction of the formation..." Li Fan said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"At least, according to my investigations, that should be what happened." Seeing the flicker of sharpness in Mo Rushen's eyes, Li Fan shrugged and said candidly.</p><p></p><p>"Those useless Ten Sects, how could they possibly control the Floating Across Formation?! Unless..." An aura of violent, dangerous fluctuations suddenly emanated from Mo Rushen.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shifted slightly and agreed: "It must have been the renegade King who taught the Ten Sects the control methods."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rushen's brow furrowed deeply, but he did not respond.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he finally shook his head and said, "Not necessarily. Perhaps they were captured by the Ten Celestial Sects and tortured into revealing the information."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan could not help but feel some surprise at Mo Rushen's attitude.</p><p></p><p>Because he knew that the Xuantian King had previously given the control methods for the various sub-formations of the Floating Across Formation to different Kings, as a precaution.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rushen was in charge of the Soul Gathering Ascension Formation, also known as the Dark Sea. While Ji Yuhan was in charge of the Celestial Binding Golden Chains.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps sensing Li Fan's emotions, Mo Rushen explained his reasons for defending them: "Back then, Senior Xuanxuan had revealed to me that those in control of the Celestial Binding Chains were Ji Yuhan and Luo Yichen..."</p><p></p><p>The chapter is not finished yet, please click the next page to continue reading the exciting content!</p><p></p><p>"Of the twelve of us, any one could have betrayed us. Only those two would not," Mo Rushen stated with conviction.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered this: "In Ji King's memories, she deeply adored the Xuantian King. As for Luo Yichen..."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rushen nodded: "Correct, it was because of her feelings for Senior Xuanxuan that she beheaded all her myriad faces. From then on, she devoted herself solely to him."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head vigorously: "For the Xuantian King to entrust the same matter to these two women. That move was quite unwise!"</p><p></p><p>"The friend thinks too much. Their relationship was very good," Mo Rushen said.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Ru Bin smiled faintly. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not explain further.</p><p></p><p>As they chatted idly, the two had already decided on the first location to investigate the trail of Xuan Tian Wang.</p><p></p><p>It was within the Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>Following almost the same path as their exploration in the previous life, after much trouble and Li Fan pretending to be shockingly clueless, the two finally arrived at the core of the Spirit Gathering Ascension Formation. </p><p></p><p>First they were horrified by the true immortal corpses deep in the Dark Sea as well as the vaguely activating and triggered true immortal will to survive.</p><p></p><p>After coming to his senses, Mo Ru Bin was slightly taken aback: "Hm? It seems someone has been here not long ago!"</p><p></p><p>However, he did not seem flustered, but rather revealed a hint of pleasant surprise, and hastily asked: "Was it Xuan Tian Wang?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Ru Bin did not doubt the person beside him.  </p><p>After all, this formation's seal was the Opportunity Immortal Formation [Spirit Gathering Ascension], not something ordinary people could break through.</p><p></p><p>"However, there are indeed traces of someone entering here before...although they were unable to reach the core true immortal corpse area..."</p><p></p><p>"People from the Ten Immortal Sects died here. They were likely lured and then killed by the true immortal will to survive."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be Elder Cui?"</p><p></p><p>Cui Zhiyuan was another Dharma King who co-presided over the Spirit Gathering Ascension Formation with him. </p><p></p><p>With this guess in mind, yet when Mo Ru Bin investigated the traces of the formation's activation again, he felt something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't seem like they directly opened the seal, but rather forcibly broke through without destroying the immortal formation's foundation...using brute force over ingenuity..."</p><p></p><p>"And afterwards they even improved the formation, sealing off the true immortal will and preventing outsiders from trespassing."</p><p></p><p>Mo Ru Bin pondered for a long time, but still found the identity of this intruder hard to fathom.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could see his doubts, but did not kindly reveal the past deeds of the Dharma Transmission Celestial Venerable directly.</p><p></p><p>After struggling for a while, Mo Ru Bin finally decided to set this matter aside first. He would search for Xuan Tian Wang's trail within the Dark Sea first.</p><p></p><p>The core of the Spirit Gathering Ascension Formation, like a circular observation chamber, lit up within the Dark Sea. Faint ripples emanated from within, rapidly spreading into the Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>It was not until half a moment later that Li Fan felt these ripples returning.</p><p></p><p>Mo Ru Bin remained expressionless, waiting for all the ripples' search results to come back.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that Xuan Tian Wang did not exist within this Dark Sea.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Mo Ru Bin's brow furrow deeply again, Li Fan could not help but console him: "We'll set off for the next location then."</p><p></p><p>Mo Ru Bin shook his head: "I also did not hope to find Elder Xuan so easily."</p><p></p><p>"I just feel that there is something off about this Dark Sea."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart stirred: "What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>"The Dark Sea was created atop true immortal corpses. Although the true immortals have completely perished, they were after all true immortals - their methods could far exceed the imagination of us ordinary cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"For example, the self-generated [Will to Survive] after sensing living beings trespassing. The dark forces accumulated here also seem to have undergone subtle changes compared to back then." Mo Ru Bin's expression was somewhat grave.</p><p></p><p>Following Mo Ru Bin's gaze, Li Fan also looked into the boundless darkness.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it is under the influence of this will to survive that the dark forces have become different."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pretended to be extremely shaken: "The abilities of true immortals are so terrifying? What exactly does Senior Brother mean by this change in the dark forces?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Ru Bin: "It's still unclear now. But one thing is certain - the trend will inevitably be towards benefiting the true immortals' resurrection. Even if they cannot be fully revived in the end, the trend will definitely exist."</p><p></p><p>"Do you still remember those few corpses we saw on the way? Their life essence was completely devoured, turned into nourishment for the true immortals' resurrection...perhaps when this Dark Sea senses living beings useful for reviving the true immortals, it will also launch similar attacks."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, after being transformed by the Spirit Gathering Ascension Formation, the dark forces influenced by the true immortal remains are far less potent than the true immortal will itself. Things have not become as dire as I imagined."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded deeply in agreement: "The energy this Dark Sea has accumulated is already so enormous. If they run amok, I'm afraid they could devour the entire Xuan Huang Realm in an instant and turn it into nourishment for the true immortals' resurrection..."</p><p></p><p>Mo Ru Bin looked deeply into the Dark Sea and nodded: "If left uncontrolled, that day may very well come in the future."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan asked curiously: "If, I mean if the entire Xuan Huang Realm was used as nourishment, would that truly be enough for the immortal remains to be reborn?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Ru Bin turned his head to look at Li Fan, remaining silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>There was no malice in Li Fan's eyes, only pure curiosity about the unknown.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long while, Mo Ru Bin said: "Just looking at the power level, the current Xuan Huang Realm should be enough, having integrated so many cultivating realms, even if only the remnants after annihilation..."</p><p></p><p>"Although the living beings of the world are ruined, their origins still remain."</p><p></p><p>"But even if resurrected, it would likely only be an empty shell, a walking corpse without its true consciousness..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slowly: "The physical body of a true immortal, that alone would be an extraordinary existence. If one could usurp and possess it, would that not mean achieving true immortality from a certain perspective in this era?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Ru Bin smiled at Li Fan's flight of fancy, not taking it seriously.</p><p></p><p>After the fruitless search of the Dark Sea, the two planned to go to the second location - the Beast's Eye.</p><p></p><p>"The Beast's Eye can not only probe the starry seas, but also monitor the Xuan Huang Realm. Independent from the Xuan Huang Realm, it is only connected through the profoundly mysterious link. If the Beast was still around, we could go there directly. But now that the Beast has perished in battle, it will take some effort to get there," Mo Ru Bin explained.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he went with Li Fan to the Nine Mountains State. </p><p></p><p>Looking at the towering continuous mountain ranges standing between heaven and earth, a hint of sadness flashed in Mo Ru Bin's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Then, just like in his previous life, he found the white jade flagpole celestial artifact in the underground ruins.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p>"A celestial artifact?"</p><p>Li Fan pretended to be extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>Mo Ru Bin was nonchalant: "Just an empty celestial artifact shell with its spiritual power depleted."</p><p></p><p>"However, borrowing it to go to the Beast's Eye is not difficult."</p><p></p><p>Mo Ru Bin began setting up the formation with the white jade flagpole as the central core.</p><p></p><p>"In my search for Xuan Tian Wang, I have also encountered some celestial artifact fragments. But they were all like this white jade flagpole, their spiritual power completely dissipated. Some were even shattered, as if struck by a great calamity."</p><p></p><p>"What kind of catastrophic scene did Xuan Tian Wang witness in the immortal realm back then? For even the immortal realm to be unable to escape unscathed?" As Li Fan sighed, he also inquired.</p>

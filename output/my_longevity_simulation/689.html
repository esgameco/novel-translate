        <h1>Chapter 689</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After all, standing there, the extraordinary beauty Xu Bai could attract the attention of passing cultivators without doing anything.</p><p></p><p>Even though cultivators could reshape their appearance and there were many with stunning looks, Xu Bai could still amaze people at first sight.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his ethereal and mysterious aura added a hint of allure.</p><p></p><p>Both men and women lingered in the shop. While secretly observing Xu Bai, they casually bought a pot of Spirit Blossom as a cover.</p><p></p><p>Business boomed, and the shop owner naturally rejoiced. Overjoyed, he wished Xu Bai could stay in the shop day and night.</p><p></p><p>However, obviously, this was impossible.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, the Spirit Blossom chosen by Xu Bai proudly bloomed.</p><p></p><p>Originally, no one paid much attention. Their gazes still lingered on Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>But when Xu Bai held the Spirit Blossom in his hand, and everyone casually glanced at it...</p><p></p><p>There were continuous exclamations.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>"Rich red like powder, faintly invisible... could be rated as the top-quality Spirit Blossom!"</p><p></p><p>"Wow, I heard that a top-quality Spirit Blossom sold for a high price of one hundred thousand contribution points not long ago. This pot should be worth no less than that, right? I heard he bought it for a thousand contribution points, isn't he making a fortune?"</p><p></p><p>"Wow, not only is he handsome, but his luck is also so good. I'm really envious."  </p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"This is the use of aura. Even without deliberate pursuit, every word and action leads things to develop in a direction favorable to oneself." Xu Bai held the Spirit Blossom in his hand, silent, pondering on how aura influences reality.</p><p></p><p>Feeling a part of his aura disappeared, Xu Bai immediately replenished it from the Blackbird Feather.</p><p></p><p>Coming back to his senses, looking at the cultivators, including the shop owner, who were excitedly staring at the Spirit Blossom in his hand, Xu Bai couldn't help but smile faintly.</p><p></p><p>"No matter how beautiful a face is, it cannot compare to profit."</p><p></p><p>So, in front of everyone present,</p><p></p><p>he casually said, "What top-quality, it's really rubbish."</p><p></p><p>After that, a surge of spiritual energy flowed, and the top-quality Spirit Blossom with twelve petals turned into ashes in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing!"</p><p></p><p>The scene immediately became noisy.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Bai was the owner of this Spirit Blossom, how to handle it was entirely his personal matter.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how you put it, it was a valuable treasure worth more than one hundred thousand contribution points. Destroying it so casually, not to mention calling it "rubbish"...</p><p></p><p>That was a bit too much!</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the cultivators present were not good-looking.</p><p></p><p>There was even a scholar-like cultivator holding a Spirit Blossom, with a stern face, walking up to Xu Bai: "Fellow Daoist! You don't have to love it, but please don't harm it!"</p><p></p><p>"The life of the Spirit Blossom is already extremely short. At the time of its full bloom, it should be showcased to the world freely..."</p><p></p><p>He was still making righteous and declarative statements.</p><p></p><p>"Make way, you're blocking me." Xu Bai took out a folding fan and pushed him aside.</p><p></p><p>Completely ignoring him, he walked away slowly.</p><p></p><p>"You..." The scholar-like cultivator's face turned red instantly.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, this scholar was not bad-looking. But compared to Xu Bai, he lacked a certain charm. He was already a bit irritated towards Xu Bai, and being belittled like this at the moment, a mix of jealousy and anger surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"A top-quality Spirit Blossom is rubbish, you have such a big mouth! Do you know that the original breed is not prominent, and the most beautiful Spirit Blossoms in the world are those few top-quality ones. Have you ever seen one?" The scholar yelled at Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>"As far as I know, those few top-quality Spirit Blossoms have just bloomed and were bought by people to present to the elites of various immortal alliances for viewing. What is your identity, and when did you see them?"</p><p></p><p>The scholar was still a bit cautious, afraid to offend the wrong person. His tone was somewhat restrained, with a probing undertone.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Xu Bai turned around.</p><p></p><p>"Swish," the folding fan opened. With a light wave, he smiled and shook his head, "I have never seen those so-called top-quality Spirit Blossoms."</p><p></p><p>"Then you are arrogant and ignorant..." The scholar sighed in relief, angrily rebuking him.</p><p></p><p>"But in my eyes, those top-quality Spirit Blossoms are just rubbish."  </p><p></p><p>Though Xu Bai's voice was very soft, to the others, it was like a thunderclap.</p><p></p><p>The scholar was stunned on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a sigh, he said, "It seems that only..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai picked up from where he left off, "Indeed! Only the original breed can truly be called Spirit Blossom!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, he stretched out his right hand.</p><p></p><p>A crystal-clear, thin as cicada wings "paper" unfolded in his hand.</p><p></p><p>A Spirit Blossom, as if alive, vividly appeared on the paper, even showing slight trembling.</p><p></p><p>The scene instantly fell into a deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>Everyone had some knowledge about Spirit Blossoms, and the original breed Spirit Blossom in Xu Bai's hand instantly captured all their attention.</p><p></p><p>"The original breed?"</p><p></p><p>After a moment, someone woke up from their trance and couldn't help exclaiming.</p><p></p><p>"What, that is the original breed!"</p><p></p><p>"An extraordinary sight of the Spirit Blossom, truly deserving of its name. Compared to the original breed, all those top-quality or first-class ones, as long as they have a hint of color, are like garbage!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Not only did the arrogant scholar freeze, but the cry of "original breed" also attracted the gazes of most of the cultivators in Spirit City.</p><p></p><p>More and more cultivators rushed over upon hearing the news, staring blankly at the original breed Spirit Blossom in Xu Bai's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!" The Spirit Blossom in the scholar's hand fell to the ground, but he didn't care.</p><p></p><p>He just stared at the original breed in Xu Bai's hand, eyes fascinated, slowly approaching.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to get close to Xu Bai, Xu Bai suddenly collected it.</p><p></p><p>"No..."</p><p></p><p>As if losing his most beloved person in an instant, the scholar's face showed a hint of ferocity. Seeming to go crazy, he lunged towards Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>In the Immortal Alliance city, fighting was prohibited.</p><p></p><p>Before the towering and majestic statue of the Lord of Laws could come down with punishment, a gleam shone from Xu Bai's clothes.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai stood unmoved as the scholar screamed and was knocked back by the rebound force.</p><p></p><p>Then, a radiance descended from the statue of the Lord of Laws, and the scholar instantly turned charred black.</p><p></p><p>Struggling for a moment, he lost his breath and fell to the ground, dead.</p><p></p><p>The students of the Hall of Martial Arts hurriedly came to collect the body, and with the sight of a head cultivator falling, finally, it deterred the group of people.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai arched his hand towards the surroundings and left gracefully.</p><p></p><p>"It is over. The business of the Spirit Blossoms is finished." The shop owner watched Xu Bai's departing figure with a lifeless face, murmuring to himself.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the fully stocked Spirit Blossoms in the shop and hastily wrote a "50% off" promotion sign, hanging it outside.</p>

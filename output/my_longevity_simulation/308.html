            <p>In an instant, it had already enveloped the entire sea of clouds.</p><p></p><p>"Chiyan Immortal Zhang Zhiliang, cultivated for 683 years. Achieved the foundation with the rare treasure 'Sleepless Eyes', and formed the golden core with the 'Infinite Formation'."</p><p></p><p>"Seized the 'One-Eyed Grotto Heaven' to form the Nascent Soul."</p><p></p><p>"Sacrificed the 'Chiyan Soul' to unite with the Dao."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, heavenly punishment descended, and the Dao was extinguished and returned to the heavens!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Against the backdrop of the fallen Immortal's phenomenon filling the sky, a jet-black figure quietly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Zhiliang's corpse turned into a drop of thick ink, wriggling back into His hand.</p><p></p><p>Then, His gaze turned to the sea of clouds below.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the cultivators in the sea of clouds who witnessed this scene first fell into a daze.</p><p></p><p>Then, an unstoppable fear was born in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Making their bodies tremble and souls shudder.</p><p></p><p>"The soul of heaven and earth, Mosha!"</p><p></p><p>For some reason, another soul of heaven and earth suddenly descended.</p><p></p><p>He not only wiped out Zhang Zhiliang, who had successfully united with the Dao, with a casual strike.</p><p></p><p>He seemed unsatisfied and set his sights on the myriad beings in the sea of clouds!</p><p></p><p>Mosha lightly pointed to a nearby space.</p><p></p><p>"Tianyang, you..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could utter the last sentence of his life, Tianyang, who had narrowly escaped with his life under Zhang Qianmo's Purple Thunder, was devoured by thick ink.</p><p></p><p>Another phenomenon of a cultivator's demise appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>However, countless black particles surged out from Mosha's body.</p><p></p><p>These black particles jumped and danced, surging into the sky, obscuring the entire firmament.</p><p></p><p>True darkness had descended.</p><p></p><p>The black particles continued to multiply, like a huge black curtain, enveloping the entire sea of clouds.</p><p></p><p>Then it pressed down, devouring everything.</p><p></p><p>This scene was too horrifying. The cultivators on the Myriad Immortals Island revealed their ugly sides under extreme fear.</p><p></p><p>Just like when Mosha destroyed the world before, some completely lost the courage to resist, collapsed on the ground, and waited for death in despair.</p><p></p><p>Some were filled with resentment, throwing themselves at the ink like moths to a flame, constantly attacking it in an attempt to find a glimmer of hope for survival.</p><p></p><p>Some were crying and laughing, seemingly driven insane by this sight.</p><p></p><p>"What's meant to come will come."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan once again became the one among the cultivators who was completely different.</p><p></p><p>He observed the scene of Mosha corroding everything with a hungry and greedy gaze, unwilling to miss a single detail.</p><p></p><p>No matter what magical techniques or divine powers, in the face of those black particles, they all lost their effect and could only be devoured and assimilated.</p><p></p><p>Life, spiritual energy, matter...</p><p></p><p>They all became nourishment for its multiplication.</p><p></p><p>"It is truly terrifying and formidable..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Mosha's actions again, Li Fan was still shocked by His methods.</p><p></p><p>"If I could achieve the golden core using Mosha's method, my killing power would not be inferior to anyone here," Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Staring intently at the black particles in the sky pressing down, Li Fan's expression was obsessed.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was immersed in comprehending the Dao, another figure was also flying excitedly on the Myriad Immortals Island, using a seven-colored imprint stone to record the scene before the world's destruction.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful! Wonderful! I originally thought the immortals punishing Chiyan was the disaster, but I didn't expect there to be an even greater one!"</p><p></p><p>"Mosha descends to the world, exterminating everything!"</p><p></p><p>"This exclusive limited edition footage will allow me to make a small fortune again!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan muttered to himself, his face beaming with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his flying body came to an abrupt halt.</p><p></p><p>Looking in the direction of Li Fan, he exclaimed in surprise, "Daoist Lin Fan, why are you still here?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan woke up from his comprehension of the Dao, looked at Jiao Xiuyuan, and smiled slightly, cupping his hands in greeting.</p><p></p><p>Then he focused his attention on the black particles in the sky again.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan turned back to look at Li Fan, carefully observing his expression.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly realizing something, he said with some shock, "You're also a puppet?"</p><p></p><p>"No, not a puppet. A clone?"</p><p></p><p>His eyes narrowed as he recalled the various events that had occurred since interacting with this Lin Fan, and a strange expression appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, I never thought there would be a day when I, Jiao Xiuyuan, would misjudge someone."</p><p></p><p>"It seems this person's true identity is indeed not simple..."</p><p></p><p>Just then, a strange sound interrupted his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He looked in the direction the sound came from, and a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was also attracted by this strange sound.</p><p></p><p>Looking up, he saw huge rumbling sounds constantly coming from the sky that was already surrounded by endless black particles.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if something was constantly stirring in the ink-colored ocean, causing these black particles to become even more active and boiling.</p><p></p><p>"That direction is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes narrowed as he pondered for a moment, somewhat unsure.</p><p></p><p>"Yunshui Palace?"</p><p></p><p>The anomaly continued.</p><p></p><p>And the rumbling grew louder.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that under this black curtain, something was rapidly approaching.</p><p></p><p>A thin line tore through the black ocean, accompanied by a whistling sound, and suddenly arrived.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it appeared above the Myriad Immortals Island.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding black particles were restless, wanting to devour this presumptuous foreign object.</p><p></p><p>But the distorted blackness around that thin line formed an extremely sturdy defense line, making the black particles that could devour everything unable to advance an inch.</p><p></p><p>"It can actually resist Mosha's corrosion?! This is?" Li Fan was shocked and looked towards the thin line that had suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"The Tiansha Sword?"</p><p></p><p>The sword tip pointed straight ahead, and the killing intent gushed out as if it were tangible, forcing back all the black particles around it.</p><p></p><p>In the direction the Tiansha Sword was pointing, the black particles surged, and Mosha's figure reappeared.</p><p></p><p>He stared at the Tiansha Sword in front of him, seemingly with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"What treasure is this? It can actually contend with Mosha?" Jiao Xiuyuan exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart was even more shaken, and at the same time, he felt an inexplicable excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Between Mosha and Tiansha, who will prevail?"</p><p></p><p>He carefully observed these two.</p><p></p><p>Extremely similar, yet seemingly fundamentally different.</p><p></p><p>Mosha was pure ink-black, an all-devouring profundity.</p><p></p><p>While Tiansha was a distorted black, the epitome of madness and destruction.</p><p></p><p>The two confronted each other, and the battle was about to begin.</p><p></p><p>However, Mosha suddenly glanced at the Myriad Immortals Island below.</p><p></p><p>Countless black particles instantly vibrated, and another figure, identical to Mosha, momentarily appeared.</p><p></p><p>It turned into a thin line, easily shattering the protective Seven-Colored Falling Immortal Formation.</p><p></p><p>It also led the ink-colored ocean to completely corrode everything on the island.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was somewhat stunned.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that in the face of a great enemy, Mosha would still not forget to simultaneously carry out his own duties.</p><p></p><p>The sky gradually pressed down, and the figures of Mosha and Tiansha gradually disappeared into the black ocean.</p><p></p><p>Only the black particles that undulated like waves from time to time told of the terrifying battle above.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart was filled with regret.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that I can't witness the battle between these two."</p>

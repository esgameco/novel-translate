        <h1>Chapter 668</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After using a month's time to fully absorb all the wandering celestial fortunes of the beast realm, he finally reached the level of qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>Among the feathers of the mysterious bird, one could faintly see the virtual shadow of a newly born bird with feathers not fully grown.</p><p></p><p>It bore some resemblance to Little Black when he was young, but also displayed some differences.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes, and the next moment, the entire beast realm appeared before his eyes like a cloud of light and mist.</p><p></p><p>Every scene within it, no matter how minute, could be instantly understood.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan also noticed that there were certain areas around the two strong Daoists, Fang Zaiji and Liu San, where there was a distortion of light and shadow within a certain range. It wasn't very clear. This was when they both sensed Li Fan's prying eyes without trying to conceal it.</p><p></p><p>"In the mysterious yellow realm, the range of influence for strong Daoists is almost equivalent to a province. And in this small world, Daoist cultivators in the Dao Synthesis realm can already contend with the world. This is a natural hierarchy gap," Li Fan thought, feeling somewhat enlightened.</p><p></p><p>With a slight intention, he took a step forward and instantly crossed thousands of miles, appearing by a clear pond on a mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>When he and Fang Zaiji swept through the beast realm, they had passed by this mountain peak before, but Li Fan had not noticed the water pond on the mountaintop.</p><p></p><p>It was only when he fully grasped the celestial fortunes of the world that he realized the anomaly here.</p><p></p><p>By the water pond, there was a wooden house. Li Fan pushed open the wooden door and stepped inside.</p><p></p><p>In the room, a mysterious bird whose feathers had lost their luster was standing proudly. Though it still looked majestic, it had already lost its life force.</p><p></p><p>"Little Black..." Li Fan immediately recognized the identity of the mysterious bird.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... passing away due to reaching the end of its life?" Li Fan murmured after observing for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Although their lifespan was much longer than that of cultivators, this celestial bird, who had lived since ancient times until now, had reached the end of its life.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan soon noticed some anomalies.</p><p></p><p>In theory, Little Qing was a beast of the same era as Little Black, and the strength of the Blue Luan bird was far inferior to that of the celestial bird.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that Little Black had already fused with the celestial fortunes of this world.</p><p></p><p>There was no reason for Little Qing to still be alive and well while Little Black had already fallen.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Little Black, for some reason, consumed a large portion of its own life force?" Li Fan squinted his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Activating the Divine Ability of 'Celestial Fortune within Me,' which guarded his own body, Li Fan gently touched the body of the mysterious bird.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>As if a gentle breeze passed by, Little Black's body instantly turned into tiny particles, dissipating without a trace.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, countless scenes flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>At the beginning, the experiences he had in the world of transcendent immortals were somewhat similar to those in the real history.</p><p></p><p>In the Beast Taming Sect, growing happily with Xu Ke, meeting Mr. Bai when he entered the mountain gate, and then being sent to the Southern Ocean Sacred Beast Mountain...</p><p></p><p>In the end, he failed to pass the 'Concentric Ring' test and was banished by Emperor San Mao to this place.</p><p></p><p>The difference was that in actual history, Little Black did not seize the opportunity to see Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>Without the True Xuan Technique, he had to rely on the memory Divine Ability within his own bloodline to practice in this small world.</p><p></p><p>Although after many years he barely mastered the Divine Ability of 'Celestial Fortune within Me,' he was already bound to the fate of this world.</p><p></p><p>To leave this world, while not impossible, required a hefty price.</p><p></p><p>As long as one did not frequently leave their original world or return to replenish themselves with celestial fortunes, they would not easily suffer fatal injuries.</p><p></p><p>However, Little Black did exactly that.</p><p></p><p>And the reason was...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan organized and reviewed the memories of Little Black after it came to the beast realm.</p><p></p><p>Initially, to prevent Little Black from feeling lonely, Xu Ke would often send messages, sharing his experiences.</p><p></p><p>"Little Black, do you know how dangerous our journey has been! Not only did we encounter many unique small worlds, but we were also chased by monsters!"</p><p></p><p>"At first, we thought someone had leaked information. Later on, we discovered it was just our bad luck. We unexpectedly stumbled upon a group of monsters that appeared in the same small world for unknown reasons. We took the initiative to attack, but in the end, one monster managed to escape, leading to the exposure of our retreat message."</p><p></p><p>"But fortunately, we're almost near our destination!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Little Black, do you still remember Mr. Bai? I thought he was already powerful enough, but he turned out to be even stronger than I had imagined! I and my martial brothers were sent on a mission to explore a small world. Unexpectedly, we encountered an incredibly terrifying monster!"</p><p></p><p>"Nine heads, a massive body perched in the sky! With each bite, it seemed like it could tear and swallow a part of the world!"</p><p></p><p>"At first, I thought I was done for and would never see you again!"</p><p></p><p>"But when I left the Mysterious Yellow Realm, Brother Lu Ya gave me a red rope that Mr. Bai had woven. When that nine-headed monster bird looked at me, a thin line flew out from the red rope!"</p><p></p><p>"Before I could react, the red thin line, like a sharp sword, blasted through the air. Instantly, it took down six of the monster bird's heads!"</p><p></p><p>"And the red rope did not vanish; it even dragged it down from the sky!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Little Black, I received an extremely important mission, so I might not be able to communicate with you for a long time."</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry about this. But it's okay; just wait for me to come back!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Little Black, why do you think cultivators, who were originally humans, become so cruel to their own kind once they step onto the path of cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Scene after scene swiftly passed before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Li Fan knew that Xu Ke had once come to the Beast realm and met Little Black.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Xu Ke had already grown into a handsome and outstanding young man.</p><p></p><p>The master and servant met, and they chatted for a long time by the clear pond on the mountaintop.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Xu Ke came hastily and left in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Little Black wanted to follow Xu Ke, but due to the restrictions set by Emperor San Mao at that time and Xu Ke's warning of major changes happening in the outside world, it would be risky for Little Black to leave with him.</p><p></p><p>So Little Black stayed here, waiting for the right moment when Xu Ke would come to take it away.</p><p></p><p>After parting ways, the two communicated several times.</p><p></p><p>However, as time went on, the intervals between the communications grew longer, and from the tone and content of the communications, Li Fan could sense Xu Ke's growth.</p><p></p><p>Until one day...</p><p></p><p>Little Black suddenly lost the connection to Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>As a spirit beast companion of Xu Ke, even though their master-servant relationship had ended, they still had some mysterious connection between them.</p><p></p><p>Even separated by vast distances and across several worlds, Little Black could still faintly sense Xu Ke's existence.</p><p></p><p>And now, the disappearance of this connection could only mean one thing.</p>

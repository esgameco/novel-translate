            <p>"Hehe, friend, perhaps you've misheard. I have no idea about the original preaching location," he quickly waved his hand, looking as if he was the wrong person to approach.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Li Fan to respond, he directly flew away into the distance.</p><p></p><p>His speed was so fast, even faster than the average Golden Core cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan finally encountered someone who had information; how could he let the lead slip away so easily?</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he promptly followed but not too closely, keeping a distance behind.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he continuously transmitted, "Friend, please don't misunderstand, I have no ill intentions. I am just very interested in what you just said."</p><p></p><p>The person in front not only did not respond but also increased his speed, attempting to shake off Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan persistently followed closely, persuading all the way.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, seeing that he couldn't shake off Li Fan, the person gradually stopped.</p><p></p><p>Looking around and seeing no one, his face showed uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a while, he quietly said, "This is not the place to speak; follow me, friend!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled faintly, clasping his hands, "In that case, thank you in advance, friend!"</p><p></p><p>Following this person, they flew westward for hundreds of miles and dived into the sea.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at a building resembling a crystal palace.</p><p></p><p>Inviting Li Fan to a room in the depths of the cave, the man sighed slightly, "It's not that I was unwilling to disclose earlier; I was just afraid of trouble."</p><p></p><p>"How should I address you?" Li Fan nodded, not rushing to probe but first inquiring about the man's name.</p><p></p><p>"I am Sima Changkong!" With a wave of his hand, a servant with the upper body of a human and the lower body of a fish appeared.</p><p></p><p>After serving tea for the two individuals, he bowed and retreated.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but glance at the servant.</p><p></p><p>"Just a beast species, a personal preference, forgive me for any misunderstanding!" Sima Changkong took a sip calmly, maintaining his composure.</p><p></p><p>"Beast species..." Li Fan's eyes shimmered.</p><p></p><p>He had once heard Senior Brother Zhang refer to those half-beast, half-human bones discovered in Mr. Bai's underground chamber in Ningyuan City with that term.</p><p></p><p>He thought they had disappeared, but unexpectedly, he could still see them now.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan didn't harbor any grievances; he just nodded slightly, steering the conversation back on track.</p><p></p><p>"So you are Zhou Dao..." Sima Changkong's words revealed Li Fan's external displayed identity.</p><p></p><p>"Now that we are in my private mansion, feel free to speak your mind."</p><p></p><p>"Do you know why the island is called Ten Thousand Immortals Island?" Sima Changkong asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had also been puzzled about this question.</p><p></p><p>Because the celestial cities of each state were named after the states.</p><p></p><p>For example, Dao Yuan City, Shi Lin City, Tian Yun City, and so on.</p><p></p><p>But only this headquarters in the cluster of cloud seas was not called Cloud Sea City or Cloud Sea Island, but Ten Thousand Immortals Island.</p><p></p><p>However, he had searched through the records and found no special mention, so he had long felt that it was just a popular nickname.</p><p></p><p>Now, it seemed there might be some hidden secret behind it.</p><p></p><p>"I would like to know more," Li Fan said with a serious expression, listening attentively.</p><p></p><p>"A long time ago, when this place was still a plain with a large lake, there was an island in the lake."</p><p></p><p>"It was on this island that the Great Lake of Law passed on its teachings for the first time."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, tens of thousands of cultivators and mortals gathered here to listen to the teachings of the Immortal Saint."</p><p></p><p>"In the end, everyone came to understand the Immortal Saint's techniques and laid the foundation for the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong narrated the story in detail.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it was because of the protection of the Immortal Saint, despite changes in the mountains and rivers, this island remained unchanged in shape."</p><p></p><p>"Until thousands of years later, when the present Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance was established, and the location of the state city was chosen, in order to express respect for the Immortal Saint of Law, this island was chosen."</p><p></p><p>"To some extent, this island can be said to be the birthplace of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance. That's why it's called the 'Ten Thousand Immortals Island'."</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong explained the background concisely, had a deep drink of tea, and secretly observed Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered over the implications of Sima Changkong's words, frowning slightly, "If this is the birthplace of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance and the place where the Immortal Saint first passed on his teachings, why is it so little known today?"</p><p></p><p>"And even the relevant information is hard to find."</p><p></p><p>"Not only that, but it was taken away directly without much defense?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head, seeming to not quite believe Sima Changkong's words.</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong then sighed, "That's the reason why I was reluctant to speak earlier."</p><p></p><p>He continued in a low voice, "Tens of thousands of predecessors sacrificed their lives and spread the new techniques of the Immortal Saint. This paved the way for the present Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"This was originally a magnificent feat worthy of remembrance by all cultivators today."</p><p></p><p>"But now it has been pushed aside, even sealed off."</p><p></p><p>"The reason is that the Immortal Saint has not appeared for many years. And the ones who now control the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance are no longer the original predecessors who spread the teachings."</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong finished his tea, remarking, "The dispute between the old and new techniques is even more severe than we can imagine. In the face of this existential threat to the sect from back in the day, they naturally didn't hesitate to wield their swords."</p><p></p><p>"The true and pure disseminators of the teachings almost all perished in the struggle against the sect from the early days."</p><p></p><p>"The surviving ones today are just the small fries who have seized the authority of the Immortal Saint."</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong's tone carried a hint of disdain.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>This explanation was somewhat acceptable.</p><p></p><p>In mortal dynasties, the changing of power often led to the previous heroes being forgotten or even distorted, so it was nothing new.</p><p></p><p>This principle also applied in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>"To have gone through the changes of time and remain unchanged in form. This Ten Thousand Immortals Island might indeed hide some secrets."</p><p></p><p>"And the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance must have thoroughly explored it but found nothing, which is why they ignored it."</p><p></p><p>"But the Five Elders' side recently got some news. That's why they risked an all-out war to forcibly take Ten Thousand Immortals Island."</p><p></p><p>Thoughts raced through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>After a short while, he looked at Sima Changkong, who was silently filled with indignation, and asked, "Friend Sima, it seems you are quite knowledgeable about the various secrets of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"However, according to your words, the symbolic significance of Ten Thousand Immortals Island seems to outweigh its actual value."</p><p></p><p>"It seems like it is not worth the risk for the Five Elders to forcefully capture it. I wonder what you think about this matter, friend?" </p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong's expression turned serious.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, he slowly said, "I have a notion."</p><p></p><p>"Back then, the pioneers of the teachings, due to their rapid cultivation speed, had concepts, habits, and natures quite similar to mortals."</p><p></p><p>"After mortal death, there is a saying that the fallen leaves return to their roots."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, when the pioneers died in the battle against the sect, their remaining bones were often sent back to Ten Thousand Immortals Island for burial by their companions."</p><p></p><p>()</p>

        <h1>Chapter 734</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After Chu Shixiong left, Li Fan recalled his words, a playful expression on his face. He remembered that the Ji family seemed to have sent many of their peers to different sects. Li Fan was almost certain that the lack of contact over the years was just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Ji Zhaoxuan must be a spy sent by the Ji family to the Tianjian Sect. </p><p></p><p>Or perhaps the term "spy" is not quite appropriate, as the Tianxia Merchant Guild and the Tianjian Sect do not have any actual opposition.</p><p></p><p>"Traveling the world as a merchant, various confidential information is crucial. It is likely through such means that the Ji family can quickly learn about the happenings in the Xuanhuang Realm and profit from them."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, the news of the Tianjian Sect forging the Heavenly Splitting Divine Weapon may not be widely known. After all, raising prices and pursuing profit are the true nature of merchants."</p><p></p><p>"The Taiyuan Refined Gold..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes narrowed slightly. </p><p></p><p>To end the Yinxian Realm scene, he needs to find the master who maintains this remnant space and resolve their obsession.</p><p></p><p>Based on the clues gathered so far, it seems that Ji Zhaoxuan is the target.</p><p></p><p>"What is his obsession?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan calmed his mind and recalled the various emotions attached to his body.</p><p></p><p>When he thought of the Ji family, the deeply buried resentment and desire for revenge were sharply captured by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Being forced to leave home from a young age, thus harboring resentment."</p><p></p><p>"Let's give it a try first."</p><p></p><p>His thoughts quickly turned, and Li Fan immediately thought of a way to take revenge on the Ji family.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Li Fan contacted Chu Shixiong again.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, so Junior Brother Ji has finally come to his senses?" The other party seemed somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That's more like it. We're all family, there's no enmity that can't be overcome. I'll prepare right away and go with you to the Tianxia Merchant Guild headquarters."</p><p></p><p>"And if you succeed in becoming the Sect Master, don't forget about me." Chu Shixiong's previous arrogance had turned into fawning.</p><p></p><p>Soon, under the pretext of searching for the Taiyuan Refined Gold, the two left the Tianjian Sect and headed towards the Ji family, taking a detour at Chu Shixiong's suggestion to avoid detection.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later, they finally reached their destination - a celestial city entirely constructed from supreme spiritual stones, floating above a prosperous market town. Cultivators and merchants came and went, all casting envious glances at the floating city in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The market town was shrouded in a formation, preventing cultivators from flying and requiring them to pay a certain fee to enter.</p><p></p><p>Stepping into the market, the extremely pure spiritual energy assaulted their senses, even more so than in the Tianjian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Chu Shixiong couldn't help but praise, "No wonder it's the number one merchant guild in the world, the grandeur is impressive."</p><p></p><p>Leading Li Fan, they passed through countless shops and arrived before a majestic mansion in the center of the market.</p><p></p><p>As they approached, a cultivator in brocade robes came out to block their way.</p><p></p><p>With a friendly expression, he asked, "Do you two gentlemen have an invitation?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Shixiong snorted coldly, "Invitation? Don't be ridiculous! Do we need an invitation to enter our own home?"</p><p></p><p>The brocade-robed cultivator was taken aback, carefully examining Chu Shixiong.</p><p></p><p>"What are you looking at? It's this one beside me!" Chu Shixiong said unhappily, pointing at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The brocade-robed cultivator then shifted his gaze.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was no anger, but a slight furrowing of the brows, as if he was pondering something.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a look of surprise appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Please wait a moment, you two."</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly went into the Qi mansion.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a middle-aged monk with a square face led a group of monks out.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on Li Fan, but the square-faced monk showed no change in expression.</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Xuan, why have you returned? Have you not violated the sect rules and been expelled from the mountain gate?"</p><p></p><p>There was no joy of a long-lost relative, only a direct rebuke.</p><p></p><p>Elder Chu was about to smooth things over, but he heard Li Fan retort directly: "Who are you? I've been away from home for too long, I don't remember."</p><p></p><p>The square-faced monk's expression changed abruptly: "Rebellious son! How dare you speak to your father like that!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, his expression unchanged: "How can you prove it?"</p><p></p><p>The square-faced monk's face instantly flushed bright red.</p><p></p><p>The aura of pressure around him was about to erupt like a volcano.</p><p></p><p>The Qi mansion monks following him all had strange expressions, eyeing Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan was unafraid, letting out a light breath, and suddenly over a hundred different-colored sword qi flashed and flew out, circling around him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the two sides were about to fight, Elder Chu hurriedly said, "Misunderstanding, misunderstanding! Don't be rash!"</p><p></p><p>"I am a direct disciple of the Heavenly Sword Sect, Chu Zong Yi. This time I have a mission with Shidi Qi, and we passed through the world's market. I thought this was still Shidi Qi's home, so I planned to come back and take a look."</p><p></p><p>He hastily explained.</p><p></p><p>Qi Zhao Xuan's father paused slightly at these words. He also glanced at the over hundred sword qi surrounding Li Fan, his eyes revealing a strange color.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, he retracted his aura and snorted: "Come in then!"</p><p></p><p>After a winding path, they finally arrived in the inner hall.</p><p></p><p>Qi Zhao Xuan's father sat at the head, dismissing the others, and asked in a deep voice, "Speak, what is the purpose of your visit?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Zong Yi was about to reply, but was stopped by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"You are not qualified. Let the patriarch come instead!" Li Fan said expressionlessly.</p><p></p><p>Back at the Qi family, the buried memories also seemed to be gradually awakening.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew that the Qi Zhao Xuan's father, Qi Shi Wen, was just the manager in charge of the world's market.</p><p></p><p>He did not have much real power in the Qi family.</p><p></p><p>The true power holder was the patriarch, [Qi Wang Xian].</p><p></p><p>Many years ago, Qi Wang Xian had already reached the Dao Cultivator realm, personally establishing the World Trade Association, his true cultivation unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"You..." Qi Shi Wen's eyes flashed with barely suppressed anger.</p><p></p><p>But seeing Li Fan's emotionless gaze meeting his own, he couldn't help but shudder inwardly.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, he finally suppressed his anger.</p><p></p><p>"You wait here."</p><p></p><p>He snorted and stomped his foot, turning into a beam of light and flying up to the Spiritual Stone City.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, after all, he is your father. Aren't you being a bit too..." Chu Zong Yi asked softly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and said, "This way, doesn't it show that we have the upper hand?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's complete indifference, Elder Chu could only laugh bitterly and say no more.</p><p></p><p>While waiting, Li Fan noticed that the patterns in the hall seemed a bit familiar.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? It seems to be somewhat similar to the World Trade Association emblem in reality, but with some differences."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"It seems there is some connection between the two."</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long before Qi Shi Wen returned.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me," he said in a gloomy tone.</p>

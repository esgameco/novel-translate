            <p>Chapter 1005: The Origin of the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the avatar of the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror pondered for a moment, then reached into its own body with its right hand. </p><p></p><p>From within, it took out a flickering light sphere that seemed to be breathing, and handed it over.</p><p></p><p>"With this object on you, you can represent me," the avatar of the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Li Fan tried to take the light sphere, but grasped nothing.</p><p></p><p>"This is the origin of the mirror, born together with my main body. It neither increases nor decreases, neither is born nor dies. Outsiders cannot touch or absorb it; only I can invoke and control it."</p><p></p><p>As the avatar spoke, it pointed in the air and struck this sphere of mirror origin into Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, you wouldn't be using this mirror origin to monitor me, would you?" Li Fan raised his eyebrows and asked immediately.</p><p></p><p>The avatar's face instantly showed a hint of anger at not being trusted: "This is just an origin mark that was born with my main body. Without the enhancement of other powers, how could I achieve surveillance?"</p><p></p><p>"Besides, if you really don't feel at ease, you can completely seal this origin sphere inside your body. As long as it's inside you, it can represent me..."</p><p></p><p>Before the avatar could finish speaking, it noticed that Li Fan had indeed sealed the origin in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Only that faint, almost imperceptible connection indicated the existence of the origin.</p><p></p><p>The avatar's face instantly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>However, seeing Li Fan's nonchalant expression, it still took a deep breath to calm its mind.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, it reminded again: "With this origin sphere, you can fully trust Cang, the Mirror Holder."</p><p></p><p>"Humph, but this person is not loyal and devoted. Instead, in the long years of monitoring me, he developed an ulterior motive. He wanted to use a secret method to further gain control over me, thus overriding all the Mirror Holders..."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, how could his little scheme escape my notice? I pretended to fall into the trap step by step, but at the last moment, I turned the tables and made him my mirror slave..."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, this human body of mine wouldn't have come so easily." The avatar said smugly.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? There was even such a thing? That's the best possible outcome then! The success rate of my plan has increased by 50% with this!" Li Fan said with an admiring face.</p><p></p><p>"Time is of the essence; I'll set off immediately." Li Fan cupped his hands and finally disappeared from the avatar's sight.</p><p></p><p>The mortal city, which had fallen into stillness, instantly became lively and bustling again.</p><p></p><p>"I hope he can succeed." The avatar muttered to itself.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it didn't have much trust in Li Fan, but it was just giving it a try.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan said, deepen the cooperation through strengthening it.</p><p></p><p>If the other party could really make some impact, it wouldn't mind adding another helping force.</p><p></p><p>If the plan was aborted halfway...</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't have any loss anyway.</p><p></p><p>The mirror origin could not be taken away by anyone. As for other things like the Myriad Spirits Convergence Array and Cang the Mirror Holder...</p><p></p><p>To it, they were not worth mentioning at all.</p><p></p><p>Thinking so, the avatar hummed a little tune and started to play the role of a busy waiter again.</p><p></p><p>Above the Wei Capital.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan return, the three Sun-Sky people were a bit puzzled. </p><p></p><p>They only saw Li Fan face to face with the suspected mission target, saying something unknown.</p><p></p><p>And then, instead of choosing to strike a fatal blow, he left directly.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Envoy, this is..." Daoist Hundred Flowers asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"The matter is..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"There's been a change, there's no need to take action anymore. You can directly return to the Lingmu Realm, I still have things to do." Li Fan didn't give much explanation.</p><p></p><p>Although this matter seemed a bit anticlimactic, Tianyang and the others didn't dare to ask too many questions.</p><p></p><p>After parting ways, Li Fan first went to the hidden cave in Tianchen State and got in touch with Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>He explained the whole story of how he found the Tianxuan Mirror's avatar but couldn't kill it, and instead sought cooperation.</p><p></p><p>He even truthfully disclosed the matter of obtaining the Wanling Guishu Formation and the Mirror's Origin.</p><p></p><p>In the hidden cave, Mo Rubin's face floated in the air, falling into silence.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, he opened his mouth to praise: "Brother Xingwang has wit and has already handled it almost perfectly. No wonder back then, before making major decisions, the Xuantian King would always seek your opinion, Brother Xingwang..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan tilted his head and directly interrupted, saying: "Is that so? Maybe. I don't remember."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin smiled and no longer dwelled on this matter. Instead, he quickly changed the topic and analyzed: "According to your plan, cooperating with Tianxuan Mirror is indeed the best solution at present."</p><p></p><p>"From your description, it seems that compared to back then, the Xuantian Mirror has also undergone great changes."</p><p></p><p>"However, it should still be trustworthy."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin judged.</p><p></p><p>"In nearly ten thousand years, if one hasn't been in a coma the whole time, who can guarantee that their personality won't drastically change?" Li Fan laughed strangely a few times, hinting at something.</p><p></p><p>"As for the Xuantian Mirror, it's not a matter of whether we trust it or not. To find the Xuantian King, we can only rely on it for now."</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin was rendered speechless by Li Fan's words.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, to deduce and break the formation left by the Chuanfa Tianzun, the Wusheng Formation Crown is a bit insufficient. Didn't you say before that there was another deduction formation treasure that could split one into nine? Get it as soon as possible, I'll see if I can find a way to speed up its fusion." Li Fan casually said.</p><p></p><p>This was just a small matter, and Mo Rubin immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the two discussed the details of the plan's execution for a while before Li Fan left.</p><p></p><p>He went straight to Xuan Sushan's bamboo sea cave residence.</p><p></p><p>Through the surrounding formation restrictions, Li Fan vaguely heard the moaning sounds coming from inside.</p><p></p><p>With an unchanged expression, Li Fan flashed inside the bamboo building.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Sushan was raising a golden whip, fiercely punishing Lu Xichan.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan's face was full of blush, her eyes dazed.</p><p></p><p>Her face showed both pain and enjoyment.</p><p></p><p>Just as the two women were fully engrossed in their play, Li Fan suddenly let out a cold cough.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Sushan and Lu Xichan's bodies instantly froze.</p><p></p><p>They abruptly looked at Li Fan who had suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Their originally flushed faces instantly turned deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>They quickly got up and bowed their heads in salute.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Sushan stammered and hurriedly explained: "Lu Xichan was slacking off again, so I punished her as you instructed..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan lowered her head even further, not daring to say a word.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly, but didn't scold them afterwards.</p><p></p><p>He then said to Xuan Sushan: "Quickly invite your father to meet here."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Sushan was stunned for a moment, and then a hint of fear flashed in her eyes: "This..."</p><p></p><p>But very quickly, she thought of something: "Could it be that you..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan explained indifferently: "Things are a bit complicated. In any case, the crisis has now been resolved. There is only one Tianxuan Mirror avatar left in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Let Cang come here to see me, he will understand."</p>

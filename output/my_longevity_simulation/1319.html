        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Countless black and white lines suddenly came alive, changing their original trajectories, rushing towards Li Fan. Like tentacles, they seemed to want to entangle and lock Li Fan down. </p><p></p><p>This place called the Root of Heaven and Earth was the location where the Five Element Grand Paradise was nurtured.</p><p></p><p>The interweaving black and white lines were like a huge loom, weaving the profound and primal universe. Not just the Five Element Grand Paradise, but the initial mountains, rivers, paradises and blessed lands of the Profound Yellow Realm were all born from here. </p><p></p><p>It was the origin of the world, the convergence of laws, the beginning of creation.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan first witnessed this magnificent sight, he could only marvel at the wonders of nature and seize this rare opportunity to comprehend the drifting shards of the initial laws at the Root of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>But now, after going through more than a hundred cycles of reincarnation and returning here, Li Fan saw many things he could not perceive before.</p><p></p><p>For example, although already faint and almost merged into the entire space of the Root of Heaven and Earth, there were still traces that influenced the overall operation at the foundational level...</p><p></p><p>Human traces.</p><p></p><p>Facing the instinctive attacks of the countless black and white lines in the Root of Heaven and Earth, Li Fan did not dodge or evade, allowing them to deeply penetrate into his body.</p><p></p><p>Normally, when cultivators encountered such attacks here, their bodies composed of countless lines would quickly disperse, dissolve and completely dissipate into this space.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, there was an inexplicable great force within Li Fan's body, firmly fixing his lines in place.</p><p></p><p>No matter how the Root of Heaven and Earth tried to absorb him, he remained unmoved!</p><p></p><p>What anchored Li Fan so firmly in place was naturally the little he had comprehended of the transformations between reality and illusion.</p><p></p><p>Almost all creations originating from the Profound Yellow Realm found it difficult to resist this kind of attack from the Root of Heaven and Earth that tried to return them to their source.</p><p></p><p>But the transformations between reality and illusion came from the Dao of Returning to the Truth, which was far from something the Root of Heaven and Earth of the Profound Yellow Realm could analyze and differentiate.</p><p></p><p>Instead, specks of gray markings spread along the countless lines inserted into his body towards the depths of the Root of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>They were not the apocalyptic Celestial Runes, but countless divine thoughts differentiated by Li Fan, trying to use this attack to glimpse the secrets of the Root of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Countless scenes flashed before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the void, bright and flickering unmoving lights. Each change in brightness and darkness meant trillions of weavings of the lines.  </p><p></p><p>From nothingness to existence, in the darkness, a world was being born.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was immersed in watching, this profound scene suddenly shattered. It turned out the Root of Heaven and Earth had detected Li Fan's intrusive intent, and all the lines inserted into Li Fan's body faded away in an instant, disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's connection to the Root of Heaven and Earth was severed.</p><p></p><p>What's more, the lines that had been constantly weaving creations in his field of vision also slowly faded into the void, no longer visible.</p><p></p><p>The light suddenly brightened, as Li Fan was expelled by the Root of Heaven and Earth, returning to the Profound Yellow Heaven-Spirit State.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity."</p><p></p><p>"The instinctive crisis response was still swift."</p><p></p><p>Though he said that, Li Fan did not actually feel too regretful in his heart. His eyes narrowed as he recalled the "human traces" he had glimpsed earlier.</p><p></p><p>Probing the Root of Heaven and Earth's depths was just an excuse - Li Fan's real goal was to attract its attention, so he could sense those hidden markings more.</p><p></p><p>The markings were new and old.</p><p></p><p>If Li Fan could barely discern the new traces with his current strength, then those ancient markings were almost indistinguishable.</p><p></p><p>The newness and oldness of the markings was relative.</p><p></p><p>Even those new traces had a history of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>"The Five Element Grand Paradise was the handiwork of the ancient One Origin Sect. In order to deal with the apocalyptic calamity, they guided the generation of laws within the Root of Heaven and Earth of the Profound Yellow Realm."</p><p></p><p>"With the five elements complete and the primordial circulating, it became a realm unto itself. The nurturing of each Five Element Grand Paradise was an immense drain on the Profound Yellow Realm, like a mortal woman giving birth. By normal reasoning, one birth is already the limit. But within the Root of Heaven and Earth of the Profound Yellow Realm, the guidance left behind by the One Origin Sect has not dissipated. So this nurturing process will never stop..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze flickered, having seen through the origins of those new traces.</p><p></p><p>He pointed forward into the void, and although he felt the powerful expulsive force, Li Fan still forced his way back in with his own strength.</p><p></p><p>It was like poking a hornet's nest - in an instant, countless black and white lines in the Root of Heaven and Earth surged towards Li Fan, as if they would not rest until he was destroyed.</p><p></p><p>This time, Li Fan did not act as a target. His form flickered as he dodged the attacks of the Root of Heaven and Earth, using his finger like a blade to sever one by one the markings left behind by the ancient One Origin Sect.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum...</p><p></p><p>The Root of Heaven and Earth shook and rang out. It seemed to have understood the reason for Li Fan's actions, and the originally furious lines became gentle.</p><p></p><p>Returning to their original state, reverting to calmness.</p><p></p><p>In that flash, Li Fan had destroyed all the imprints the One Origin Sect had left on the Root of Heaven and Earth. From now on, there would be no more new Five Element Grand Paradises nurtured in the Profound Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, Li Fan planned to push for the birth of a Supreme Profound Yellow Realm. And nurturing the Five Element Paradises was an undeniable drain on the strength of the Profound Yellow Realm. Naturally, Li Fan would not allow this to continue happening.</p><p></p><p>Not just the Five Element Grand Paradises, Li Fan would prevent the birth of any other paradises in the Profound Yellow Realm that did not need to be nurtured, accumulating strength for the Profound Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>The expulsive force of the Root of Heaven and Earth had completely disappeared, allowing Li Fan to observe those invisible ancient markings more carefully.</p><p></p><p>"Just as I expected. Exactly the same as the ancient celestial formation guarding the Nine Stars Crimson Pearl."</p><p></p><p>The ancient markings, like inborn birthmarks, were almost fused with the space of the Root of Heaven and Earth itself. If Li Fan had not been fortunate enough to have seen similar existences before, he might have mistaken them for inherent features of the Root of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Part of the markings had already deeply penetrated the space itself, so Li Fan could not glimpse the original form of this celestial formation.</p><p></p><p>However, by comparing it with the original array data from the Terminal Separation Disk, most of it matched up.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally found you," Li Fan's eyes shone.</p><p></p><p>In his previous deductions, the Floating Through Stars Formation consisted of four sub-formations.  </p><p></p><p>Through his previous reincarnation experiences, Li Fan had confirmed three-quarters of them.</p><p></p><p>They were: the golden chains used to lock down and capture cultivators from outside the Stellar Realm; the Beast's Eye acting as an observation station; and the Sombre Sea, which was the Gathering Spirit Ascension Formation used to escape the gravitational pull of the Celestial Ruins.</p><p></p><p>The remaining one, however, could not be found no matter how thoroughly Li Fan searched the Profound Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, in this life, he revisited this place to absorb the anchor point and stumbled upon this pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>"This Floating Through Formation was likely completed by the Profound Celestial Emperor based on the ancient celestial formation used to protect the realm in the past."</p><p></p><p>"Unlike the other few formations..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"The degree of transformation here is quite minor, one could almost say it remains completely original."</p><p></p><p>"With the Roots of Heaven and Earth constantly weaving and creating, even when the Xuanhuang Realm travels through the sea of stars, it has the ability to continuously repair itself and even grow stronger."</p><p></p><p>"This kind of growth stemming from one's intrinsic nature is different from the Dharma Transmission and Celestial Physician's use of remnant realms for suturing. There will be no bizarreness caused by repelling world laws, no side effects during the fusion process..."</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan's eyes, a scene suddenly appeared. </p><p></p><p>In the boundless dark void, the Xuanhuang Realm advanced steadily like a giant galactic battleship.</p><p></p><p>The Beast's Eye was responsible for observation and positioning. The golden chains on the outside searched for enemies and gathered resources; the Dark Sea provided continuous power; while the Roots of Heaven and Earth were in charge of repair and growth. </p><p></p><p>It was truly perfect for surviving in the sea of stars.</p><p></p><p>"Floating through the starry void, floating through the starry void."</p><p></p><p>"With this great formation, one can indeed traverse the starry void and ignore disasters. The Xuan Heavenly King was truly an unmatched genius!" Li Fan praised wholeheartedly.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity..."</p><p></p><p>"That such a remarkable person disappeared without a trace just as he was about to ascend to immortality." Li Fan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The disappearance of the Xuan Heavenly King was one of the greatest mysteries of the Xuanhuang Realm from ancient times until now. Even though Li Fan had reincarnated so many times, and even when the immortal formation was destroyed, revealing all the shrouded plots, he still could not glimpse the truth.</p><p></p><p>He could only vaguely guess that the formal process of ascending to immortality might carry immense risks.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Xuan Heavenly King is no longer here, this Floating Formation can still be used by me."</p><p></p><p>"Previously I had speculated that after the Xuan Heavenly King mysteriously disappeared, he might be hiding in the last remaining Floating Formation. But looking at it now..."</p><p></p><p>Because Li Fan had helped with the "birth control", the Roots of Heaven and Earth had chosen to let bygones be bygones regarding his previous act of devouring the Five Elements Great Heaven Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, it did not generate much goodwill either.</p><p></p><p>It merely allowed Li Fan to linger in this world where laws and immortal formations intertwined.</p><p></p><p>This place seemed boundless, but was in fact an illusion created by the interweaving of laws and immortal formations.</p><p></p><p>As an expert in formations, Li Fan did not get lost within.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he had thoroughly searched the interior of the Roots of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan had thought, he did not find any trace that the Xuan Heavenly King might exist here.</p><p></p><p>"If he was in the Xuanhuang Realm, with his strength he could absolutely withstand one or two things. Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's brows furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rushen had no reason to abandon his long-held goal and directly flee the Xuanhuang Realm. So it was highly likely that he had gone to the Beast's Eye located outside the Xuanhuang Realm at some unknown location.</p><p></p><p>"The Beast's Eye, able to serve as a surveying formation for floating through the starry void, its observable range should be even vaster than I imagined. It may not just be the void outside the realm..." A hint of realization flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"The Floating Formation is almost integrated with the Xuanhuang Realm. This Beast's Eye may even be able to reverse and observe the Xuanhuang Realm itself. However, Mo Rushen may not have known its precise location either, so randomly searching in the starry void would carry certain risks. That's why in the 119th life, when I pretended to cooperate with him, he did not choose this path. And in the previous life when he was hunted by the Saint Emperor's avatar, he was almost out of options and forced to make that choice."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan learned about the Beast's Eye through an unlucky person from Jiushan State who was randomly transmitted there when casting a teleportation formation. This caused him to encounter the Celestial Physician who sensed the aura. Fortunately, relying on his own wit, he was able to gain the Celestial Physician's trust and obtain the secret Supplement Heaven Scripture in return.</p><p></p><p>The probability of randomly being transmitted to the Beast's Eye was simply too low, so Li Fan naturally would not attempt it himself.</p><p></p><p>However, Jiushan State was where the Beast's remains had transformed. It must have some connection to the distant Beast's Eye. Perhaps he could use this link to locate the Beast's Eye.</p><p></p><p>"The Floating Formation is also extremely important for my ascension of the Xuanhuang Realm this life."</p><p></p><p>"Although the great formation is already shattered, if I can repair it and reactivate it..."</p><p></p><p>During the Xuan Heavenly King's era, the Floating Formation only covered a small area of the original Xuanhuang Realm. </p><p></p><p>Compared to the current Xuanhuang Realm that had fused with many realms, it was only the central core region.</p><p></p><p>"But if I expand the formation, I can control the Xuanhuang Realm without the heavens or ghosts being any the wiser."</p><p></p><p>The Terminal Separation Disc was temporarily unable to split due to its heavy tasks.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could only rely on his own understanding of formations to deduce.</p><p></p><p>In his consciousness, the Floating Formation radiated from the center, gradually enveloping the Xuanhuang light sphere. Eventually it transformed into a galactic battleship.</p><p></p><p>"When expanding and rebuilding the formation, I can integrate the Apocalyptic Immortal Formation I comprehended in my previous life."</p><p></p><p>"Once the Xuanhuang Realm finally completes its metamorphosis, no matter how powerful that descending immortal spirit is, exceeding my expectations, with the formation acting as shackles, it will be impossible for it to escape my grasp." Li Fan pondered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>One had to admit, working on the shoulders of predecessors was naturally much easier.</p><p></p><p>With the foundation laid by the Xuan Heavenly King back then, Li Fan could save a great deal of effort in realizing his plan.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, without the Xuan Heavenly King's arrangements, relying solely on Li Fan's current cultivation in formations, he would never be able to construct an entirely new Floating Formation.</p><p></p><p>"Currently, the information about the four Floating Formations is still a bit lacking."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan naturally envisioned Mo Rushen's figure.</p><p></p><p>In the previous life's battle against the Saint Emperor, Mo Rushen's tricks had been observed quite thoroughly by him.</p><p></p><p>As long as he made preparations in advance, Li Fan was confident he could control him.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Before seeking out Mo Rushen for revenge and information, Li Fan first went to another former Xuan Heavenly Cult Dharma King.</p><p></p><p>At the Eastern Eternal Continent, Huanxing Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual flowers filled the sky, breathtakingly beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Yet Li Fan knew that hidden within these exquisite blossoms were the memories, or rather, the soul fragments of the former Xuan Heavenly Cult Dharma King Ji Yurong.</p><p></p><p>Even the Xuan Heavenly King Xuanxuan Hong himself had praised Ji Yurong's cultivation method, the Infinite Celestial Pivot Separation Divine Art, as rarely seen in his lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Although Ji Yurong seemed to have fallen, a glimmer of life remained, concealed within these endless soul flowers.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the previous life, amidst the storm of the apocalyptic immortal formation, this place was the last flickering beacon where the Myriad Immortal Alliance persisted.</p><p></p><p>"The memory probing technique I used previously still had some flaws."  </p><p></p><p>"Ji Yurong's memories still hide the true secrets."</p><p></p><p>A flash of light gleamed in Li Fan's eyes as an ordinary white ring suddenly appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>It was the Luo Fan Chen.</p><p></p><p>With a light toss upwards, the white ring instantly enveloped the entire Huanxing Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Silently descending, it transformed everything it covered into spiritual energy.  </p><p></p><p>The vast Huanxing Mountain, every inch shattered into the realm.</p>

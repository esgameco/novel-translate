            <p>This term is too sensitive. That…Øo…îÀôxn…•s69novel69new</p><p></p><p>So sensitive that Lu Xichan subconsciously ignored what Huangfu Song said afterwards.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, she did not express her stance immediately.</p><p></p><p>She just retracted her gaze from below, turned it into a rainbow light amidst the gazes of many cultivators in Hualing Gorge, and returned to the resting place.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu and Dongfang wiped the cold sweat from their foreheads and hurried to catch up.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Huangfu, for being able to strategize in front of Chief Lu. Your future is boundless!" Dongfang Yao transmitted his words as they flew.</p><p></p><p>"Don't try to flatter me, Dongfang. What kind of person is Chief Lu? Does she really need my advice? It's just prudent to work, and when the time comes for backlash, it's convenient for me to be the one who suggested it and be pushed out as a scapegoat."</p><p></p><p>"How can you not see through that?" Huangfu Song coldly snorted, very displeased.</p><p></p><p>"Huangfu, not many people have the opportunity to be Chief Lu's scapegoat. Besides, given Chief Lu's character, I don't think she will necessarily..." Dongfang interrupted.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..."</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao was dejected, but then sighed, "There have been rumors before that the struggle between the tradition bearers and the newly emerged Joint Daoists in the past thousands of years has become very intense. I thought it was just an exaggeration."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect to witness it today, and it's true."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song also sighed slightly, "Being forced to take sides today, it's hard to say if it's a blessing or a curse. If successful, naturally, there will be great wealth and glory in the future. If it fails..."</p><p></p><p>The two glanced at each other and fell silent.ùü®ùü´novels ú·¥úx.com</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Hualing Gorge, after Lu Xichan and the other two left.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also followed the returning team back to their residence.</p><p></p><p>When Chief Lu's gaze fell on him, Li Fan knew she had recognized him successfully.</p><p></p><p>However, what surprised Li Fan was that Chief Lu, a powerful Joint Daoist, just hesitated for a moment and then stopped paying attention to him.</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, he is the savior of your daughter's life. After finally seeing him, is he just going to leave like this?" Li Fan was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>But later, noticing the expressions of Huangfu and Dongfang, Li Fan knew that perhaps his plan had not failed.</p><p></p><p>However, Joint Daoists, especially those with heavy responsibilities, might need to be more "reserved" in their actions.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan patiently waited, maintaining a calm and composed demeanor.</p><p></p><p>As expected, a day later, after Lu Xichan left in a rainbow, Huangfu Song came knocking.</p><p></p><p>"Suddenly received a special assignment, to go to the Five Elements Great Cave?" Li Fan was pleasantly surprised to hear from the chubby man in front of him that things were going so smoothly this time.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, young friend, your wish is fulfilled! The weight of the Five Elements Great Cave ranks at the forefront among all the secret realms of the Immortal Union."</p><p></p><p>"And due to its special status, the construction of the Tianxuan Soul Lock Array has just begun and is still at the initial stage."</p><p></p><p>"This trip is a great opportunity for you to show your skills."</p><p></p><p>"If you make a bit more effort, you can strive for the top spot as well." Huangfu Song beamed with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained composed, "I must thank the senior for the assistance. I will always remember this favor!"</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song waved his hand, "Don't mention it. To be frank, I also benefitted from you this time."</p><p></p><p>"However, there is one thing to remind you." Huangfu Song restrained his smile and said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Seeing the senior's unusually serious expression, Li Fan also became more serious.</p><p></p><p>"Please speak, senior!"</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song said, "Apart from the Five Elements Great Cave, there were other choices for the secret realm to visit. In fact, just until recently, Chief Lu was hesitant about whether to send us to the Five Elements Great Cave."</p><p></p><p>"But a sudden event that happened recently changed her mind."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression turned grave, waiting quietly for more information.</p><p></p><p>"This matter is absolutely confidential, and currently only a few people in the entire Immortal Union know about it. Remember not to leak this information."</p><p></p><p>After some reminders, Huangfu Song then lowered his voice and said quietly, "The Five Elements Great Cave is now located at the junction of the Tianchen and Tianshu states."</p><p></p><p>"But do you remember where this Five Elements Great Cave was originally discovered?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately replied, "How could I forget about that? The battle in Tianling Prefecture had an extremely profound impact on the entire Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean by this, senior?"</p><p></p><p>With a deep gaze, Huangfu Song's expression revealed a hint of shock.</p><p></p><p>He slowly said, "Following the battle in Tianling Prefecture, our Immortal Union exerted great efforts to move the Five Elements Great Cave back to the hinterland, to its current location now."</p><p></p><p>"However, three days ago, an urgent report was received by the Union, indicating a mysterious spiritual energy fluctuation in that void and empty place."</p><p></p><p>"After investigating, the results were almost unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song paused, seeming to calm the shock in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Then he continued, "These spiritual energy fluctuations are in five places."</p><p></p><p>"After multiple confirmations."</p><p></p><p>"It is the sign of a new heavenly realm being reborn!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed with excitement upon hearing this, staring intently at Huangfu Song.</p><p></p><p>"A new heavenly realm?"</p><p></p><p>"A new Five Elements Great Cave?"</p><p></p><p>With a slight tremor in his voice, full of undisguised astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song nodded.</p><p></p><p>"How is this... possible?" Li Fan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>With his limited knowledge, the formation of any heavenly realm was usually a result of chance and the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>The fact that Tianling Prefecture was able to give birth to five complementary Five Elements caves was already a miracle among miracles.</p><p></p><p>However, after the Immortal Union moved the Five Elements Great Cave to a new location.</p><p></p><p>Would a new Five Elements Great Cave actually emerge in the original location?</p><p></p><p>"What about the current Five Elements Great Cave? Has anything unusual happened to it?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the special mission mentioned by Huangfu Song, Li Fan pondered and immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>"There are signs of the Five Elements returning to unity, and it's irreversible," Huangfu Song's tone was somewhat heavy.</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elements returning to unity?" Li Fan furrowed his brow slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a good thing or a bad thing? What will happen after the unity? He couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Huangfu Song shook his head, "This has never happened before. Chief Lu herself, upon hearing this news, couldn't conceal her astonishment and shock."</p><p></p><p>"However, what can be confirmed now is that after the Five Elements unite, the five caves will not completely disappear."</p><p></p><p>"Instead, they will merge into a completely new heavenly realm."</p><p></p><p>"As for whether any drastic changes will occur during this fusion, turning the once rich heavenly realm into a desolate wasteland, nobody can predict it."</p><p></p><p>"Either way, the plan to build the Soul Lock Array remains unchanged."</p><p></p><p>"The incident was abrupt, and Chief Lu has already gone to the site to investigate."</p><p></p><p>"We will be led there by someone later."</p>

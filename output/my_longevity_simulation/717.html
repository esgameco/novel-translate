        <h1>Chapter 717</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Huangfu Song exclaimed in shock while laying down several formations outside the Puxian Zhenzhou. The flying boat's speed of escape increased several times instantly. However, the terrifying undead giant continued to chase tightly from behind, and its speed did not seem much slower than that of the Puxian Zhenzhou.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry, let's go back to the nearest Luoyanzhou. Creatures like this can probably only be dealt with by the official intervention of the Immortal Alliance!" Li Fan gave the order, and Li Fan had already manipulated the flying boat to escape following the fastest route.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>According to the map's distance and their flying speed, by this time, they should have already broken out of the range covered by the white mist. But the surroundings were still shrouded in white mist as if it hadn't changed for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>"Trouble. We seem to have been unknowingly dragged into the maze by this undead giant," Li Fan's expression turned grim.</p><p></p><p>"What?" Huangfu Song was shocked, and after checking, he realized what Li Fan said was not groundless.</p><p></p><p>"This... we can't defeat it in a fight or escape from it. Isn't this a dead end?" Dongfang Yao's face turned slightly pale.</p><p></p><p>"Escape while thinking of a solution," Li Fan decisively said.</p><p></p><p>The Puxian Zhenzhou maintained its high-speed flight, attempting to find a way out of the maze. The undead giant followed closely, seeming determined not to give up until they caught Li Fan and the others.</p><p></p><p>Several times, the Puxian Zhenzhou was nearly caught by the undead giant. Fortunately, with Li Fan's help and his expertise in controlling the flying boat forged in the Immortal Array years ago, they managed to evade the crisis.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, why does it keep following us? What grudge does it have?" Unable to bear the tension any longer, Huangfu Song couldn't help but express his frustration.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" This unintentional remark actually reminded Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>This terrifying and eerie undead giant clearly had a connection with the Heavenly Doctor. It acted without subjective consciousness, seeming to rely solely on instinct. Why was it relentlessly chasing Li Fan and the others?</p><p></p><p>While chasing, it also emitted mournful cries of resentment.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that it sensed the aura of the Heavenly Doctor on me?" Li Fan instantly thought of this possibility.</p><p></p><p>However, he quickly dismissed this speculation.</p><p></p><p>Not only in this life.</p><p></p><p>Since his doppelganger showed a flaw in front of the Heavenly Doctor, and he was chased and forced to retreat by him, Li Fan hadn't crossed paths with the Heavenly Doctor for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Let alone having any trace of the Heavenly Doctor's aura.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced at Huangfu and Dongfang next to him.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't even hear the sound of "Heavenly Doctor" emitted by the undead giant. Obviously, they had no connection with this powerful being.</p><p></p><p>"So, what I carry on me must have attracted this undead giant?"</p><p></p><p>In a flash of insight, Li Fan vaguely thought of a possible explanation.</p><p></p><p>After scanning and checking all the items on his body, discarding some suspicious ones generously, the undead giant's behavior still didn't change.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan finally locked his gaze on a white rib bone.</p><p></p><p>This was the only item that dropped from Yinsuren after killing him in this world.</p><p></p><p>The first person infected by the Immortal Contaminant.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be because of this thing?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment and held the rib bone in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Feeling its strange, cool yet warm touch, Li Fan forcefully threw it in the opposite direction of the flying boat.</p><p></p><p>After a moment,</p><p></p><p>"Oh..."</p><p></p><p>"Heal..."</p><p></p><p>The undead giant indeed changed its target!</p><p></p><p>Abandoning the Puxian Zhenzhou, it roared and pursued the white rib bone!</p><p></p><p>"What does this mean?" Li Fan was somewhat dumbfounded, his brows furrowing as he carefully contemplated.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, even more incomprehensible events occurred.</p><p></p><p>After the undead giant obtained the rib bone, Li Fan thought it would go on a rampage in retaliation.</p><p></p><p>But its actions slowed slightly, then it stood motionless for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The recurring cries of "Heavenly Doctor" gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>The undead giant awkwardly held the rib bone to its chest, then sank and disappeared into the white mist.</p><p></p><p>Within the blink of an eye, apart from Li Fan, the other two on the boat failed to grasp what had happened.</p><p></p><p>Surviving the ordeal, they stared in astonishment at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>It took Li Fan a long time to come to his senses. He shrugged and said, "It's just luck."</p><p></p><p>Huangfu and Dongfang remained silent. However, since Li Fan had saved their lives, and he wasn't willing to reveal more, they didn't press for more information.</p><p></p><p>During this period, they truly had a bond forged through life and death.</p><p></p><p>Although they didn't express how deep their friendship was, it was certainly stronger than the bonds between most cultivators in the world.</p><p></p><p>At least, in the eyes of Huangfu and Dongfang, it was so.</p><p></p><p>Everyone had their own secrets, and they tacitly chose to avoid discussing this matter.</p><p></p><p>With the threat of the giant gone, they spent some effort and eventually managed to escape from the maze.</p><p></p><p>For some unknown reason, however, there was no reward of Qingxuan Points in this maze.</p><p></p><p>Surviving was already a great fortune. They couldn't ask for more extravagance.</p><p></p><p>After a brief discussion, they originally decided to return to rest for a while.</p><p></p><p>However, the thrilling experience of losing two Tranquility Discs in an instant made them change their minds.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of their recent narrow escape, they plunged into the white mist again.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>"So, as they say, 'man dies for wealth, birds perish for food.' This is the law of heaven and earth, which even us immortals cannot escape. Unless another Eternal Grandmaster can reverse this law, incidents like this will continue to happen within our Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Shirong confidently spoke before Xurao, not mentioning Huangfu Song and his group, but the Tianliang City Lord, Xiang Xinxin.</p><p></p><p>After a thorough investigation lasting several tens of days, and maneuvering among various powers, the person ultimately responsible for the Wang Qiupo incident was identified.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely this City Lord Xiang.</p><p></p><p>There was no choice. Most of the cultivators recommended by Wang Qiupo followed his lead. Besides, he openly admitted to having accepted many treasures from Wang Qiupo in the past. </p><p></p><p>The City Lord was eventually stripped of his position. However, he was fortunate to keep his life, and his cultivation level remained intact.</p><p></p><p>But he was banished to the far southwest Cangwu Abyss to guard against the increasingly frequent riots of the abyssal monsters.</p><p></p><p>Shirong, who had made significant contributions in this case, consequently inherited Xiang Xinxin's position. </p><p></p><p>The internal resolutions were set, and in a few days, the imperial decree would be officially issued.</p><p></p><p>In his triumphant mood, Shirong naturally did not forget Xu Bai, this "great contributor."</p><p></p><p>He even extended an olive branch to Xu Bai, intending to invite him to serve within the Tianliang State.</p><p></p><p>After all, despite his rapid rise this time, he had indeed offended a large number of people. </p><p></p><p>A weak foundation clearly necessitated the urgent cultivation of his power.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

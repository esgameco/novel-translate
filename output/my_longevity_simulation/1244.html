        <h1>Chapter 1244</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The power originally meant to protect the earth veins, after being devoured by the Dao-One Insects, instead turned into nourishing sustenance. </p><p></p><p>Initially just a fist-sized blob of black shadow, in an instant it spread out like thick ink dissolving in water, gradually dyeing the surging river of earth veins black.</p><p></p><p>What was even more bizarre was that after being eroded by the Dao-One Insects, aside from the difference in color, the black torrent was no different from the previous yellow earth veins in terms of aura and energy fluctuations. Simply sensing it, one would be completely unable to detect this kind of abnormality.</p><p></p><p>However, Wang Xuanba, who had his own avatar among the Dao-One Insect swarm, could clearly feel the terrifying growth and expansion speed of the insect swarm.</p><p></p><p>Following the earth veins, with Yueyang Prefecture at the center, it fiercely spread towards all parts of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>And in addition to the horizontal expansion, in the vertical space, the Dao-One Insects also continuously eroded downwards along the densely packed roots of the inverted tree.</p><p></p><p>"The wonders of creation, to think it would reach this point. If Master hadn't pointed it out, I'm afraid I never would have imagined that hidden beneath the Xuanhuang Realm, there would be such a big tree." Wang Xuanba sighed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the images transmitted from the bodies of the Dao-One Insects, Wang Xuanba saw those originally dense but still roots gradually seem to come alive as they continuously blackened, swaying slightly.</p><p></p><p>A vast consciousness swept back and forth in those blackened parts. Compared to before, there was an additional sense of unease and doubt. Wang Xuanba knew that should be the consciousness of the Earth Vein Ancient Tree.</p><p></p><p>But it was destined to be futile. Before these mutated Dao-One Insects fully initiated the insectification while just inhabiting it, the Earth Vein Ancient Tree was completely unable to detect the fact that its body had been invaded.</p><p></p><p>"Even knowing that there's a problem with its own body, it just can't find the reason. As the condition worsens, the panic and despair in its heart accumulates more and more. The so-called attacking the heart is the best method, Master's strategy is truly an excellent means." Wang Xuanba revealed a hint of a cold smile, feeling it was about right, then issued a command in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The surging dark shadow insect tide that had been rapidly expanding instantly came to a halt. The Dao-One Insect swarms all entered into hibernation, lurking within the body of the Earth Vein Ancient Tree.</p><p></p><p>The yellow earth vein power continued to flush through, as if suppressing the shadows. It's just that the black didn't disappear, still settling at the bottom of the yellow.</p><p></p><p>If one took a macro view, it was as if a dim spot had appeared within the Xuanhuang earth veins.</p><p></p><p>"Master said that the earth veins are ultimately tied to influencing the myriad living beings on the surface. Even a slight change is enough to cause mountains to collapse and the earth to split open. If handled improperly, it might even provoke the hostility of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao..."</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba seemed to have indeed vaguely sensed the abnormality in the will of heaven and earth just now. It's just that as the Dao-One Insect swarms entered dormancy, this abnormality quickly disappeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting." Wang Xuanba narrowed his eyes and pondered on the spot for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then he hurried towards the next earth vein node without stopping. He wanted to plant sixteen black spots like this inside the body of the Xuanhuang Earth Vein Ancient Tree.</p><p></p><p>The plan proceeded very smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Except for the last few times, where the increasingly uneasy ancient tree spontaneously triggered earth vein torrents that gave him some minor injuries, the rest of the insect shadow swarms were all arranged perfectly.</p><p></p><p>And even if the Earth Vein Ancient Tree struggled with some awareness, it was ultimately futile. Instead, it caused the speed at which the Dao-One Insect swarms spread in the earth veins to surge, with those shadow spots clearly larger by a whole size compared to other places.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later, Wang Xuanba, who had perfectly completed his mission, returned to Holy Capital.</p><p></p><p>In the Holy Emperor's seat, Li Ping's several disciples were already waiting in advance.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba was a bit surprised. These martial brothers and sisters each cultivated according to Master's teachings and rarely had the chance to meet normally. There were even some Wang Xuanba had never met face to face and only heard that Master had taken on such a disciple. He never expected that today they would all gather together.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like Master is finally going to make a big move." Wang Xuanba then became a bit excited.</p><p></p><p>Striding to the front of the Holy Emperor, Wang Xuanba knelt on one knee and reported on the mission's progress.</p><p></p><p>The Faceless Holy Emperor lightly waved his hand and helped Wang Xuanba up.</p><p></p><p>"Well done."</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba, who rarely heard words of praise from the Holy Emperor, couldn't help but raise his head.</p><p></p><p>"With sixteen groups of Dao-One Insects nailed down, the Earth Vein Ancient Tree is now doomed. Which of you will help your Master subdue this tree?" Li Ping then asked indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping looked at these few disciples who all spoke from the heart and nodded with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Six disciples, three men and three women.</p><p></p><p>They were Sun Erlang, Su Yujing, Wang Xuanba, Lin Ling, Ou Shangtian, and Daotong Liuli.</p><p></p><p>The first five had been accepted as disciples by Li Ping and carefully groomed for some time. As for Daotong Liuli, Li Ping made the decision on a whim after discovering the divine oddity of the cat.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Ping himself didn't have any ill intentions. He simply planned to raise her and then use Liuli's special connection with the Fishing Pond to seek more treasures in it. Li Ping's thoughts were sincere and he directly told her frankly. And Daotong Liuli was also very sensitive to the intentions of others. After sensing Li Ping's frank thoughts, she slowly accepted and got used to the existence of this Master.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Zhong Shentong kept nagging, telling her that she must listen well to the Holy Emperor's orders. Coupled with Baihua Daoren occasionally giving Liuli special treatment, this little Daotong's progress was instead the fastest among the disciples.</p><p></p><p>To mention Zhong Shentong again, ever since coming to the Great Qi of the Holy Dynasty, he had thoroughly begun living the laidback life he loved most. The continuously increasing spiritual energy concentration in the Holy Dynasty allowed him to leisurely live for a few more decades even without breaking through his current realm. He simply gave up on cultivation altogether.</p><p></p><p>Receiving special permission from the Holy Emperor, he spent every day happily casting his rod in the Fishing Pond, truly living an enviable life.</p><p></p><p>The perspective returned to the Holy Emperor's seat. Faced with the Holy Emperor's mission, the disciples were all eager to give it a try.</p><p></p><p>But Li Ping actually already had a decision in mind.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Ling, go with Xuanba for a trip. If that ancient tree knows what's good for it then forget it, but if it remains obstinate..." </p><p></p><p>Li Ping smiled: "You may replace it."</p><p></p><p>The incarnation of the Spirit Wood Realm's spirit wood, in this life after being enlightened by Li Ping, had been conquering other small worlds for the Great Qi of the Holy Dynasty. The killing intent on her was unrestrained, as if substantialized, making Lin Ling the most awe-inspiring existence among Li Ping's six disciples.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping entrusted the mission to her and the others had no objections.</p><p></p><p>The Faceless Holy Emperor passed a Dharma treasure in the shape of a wheel to Lin Ling in midair: "With this wheel, you can freely manipulate the Dao-One Insects. Once the insects reach the vitals, the Earth Vein Ancient Tree should not have much room for resistance. But we must also guard against it lashing out in desperation..."</p><p></p><p>After a few final simple instructions, Li Ping saw Lin Ling and Wang Xuanba off as they left the Holy Emperor's seat.</p><p></p><p>The great hall quieted down a little.</p><p></p><p>It was still Ou Shangtian who mustered up the courage to ask: "Master, about that matter you said you would entrust to me before..."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping smiled slightly: "Soon. You should also prepare yourself."</p><p></p><p>The remaining three disciples also turned their gazes over.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang, as Li Ping's eldest disciple, had long been assisting in managing the affairs of the Holy Dynasty. He knew that his Master had been planning for a long time and suddenly making a move now couldn't possibly be just for this one matter.</p><p></p><p>"Erlang." As expected...</p><p></p><p>Li Ping spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, I am here."</p><p></p><p>"On behalf of your master, go to the Five Elders Council."</p><p></p><p>He had anticipated many possibilities for the upcoming conquest, but he never expected that his master would send him to the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>This name was very unfamiliar to the vast majority of people in the Holy Dynasty. Sun Erlang had only learned some information about it from Yi Shu before.</p><p></p><p>"Ask them on behalf of your master whether they know about the past events of the Heavenly Venerable of the Eastern Pole."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping transmitted an image into Sun Erlang's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Eastern Pole?" Sun Erlang had not heard this name before. But to be called a Heavenly Venerable, his strength must undoubtedly be at the Eternal Life Realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when Sun Erlang saw clearly the image in his mind, even with his resolute nature of "living two lifetimes", he couldn't help trembling all over.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping didn't mind Sun Erlang's reaction and accepted the instructions, saying: "The Five Elders Council is different from the Myriad Immortals Alliance. The power of the Heavenly Venerables covers the entire territory and rules separately. This time, go to the territory of the [True Heavenly Venerable]. As for the other Heavenly Venerables, don't provoke them..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang firmly kept his master's instructions in mind.</p><p></p><p>Like Lin Ling, before leaving, Sun Erlang also received a treasured item as a reward.</p><p></p><p>"You already have the Dao Transformation Stone on you, which is the greatest magic weapon. Relying on other external objects would instead lead you astray." As Li Ping spoke, he slowly passed a dazzling crystal-clear stone to Sun Erlang.</p><p></p><p>In his own sea of consciousness, the Dao Transformation Stone suddenly burst out with an unprecedented blue light, followed by a flood of greedy and restless intentions.</p><p></p><p>The desire from his soul made Sun Erlang unable and unwilling to suppress it.</p><p></p><p>"Another Dao Transformation Stone? And its quality is even better than the one in my sea of consciousness! It's at least mid-grade or higher." Sun Erlang was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>After spending a long time wandering around the Holy Dynasty with Yi Shu of the Taiyi Sect, Sun Erlang naturally understood the preciousness of Dao Transformation Stones in this world. There were only a few pieces left in the world, and they were basically all occupied by other monks with deep blessings, making it impossible for outsiders to find them. But now, his master was actually able to take out a mid-grade piece to give to him...</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang kowtowed on the spot to thank his master for his kindness.</p><p></p><p>The joy in his heart directly washed away the fear that had just been generated by the state of the Heavenly Venerable of the Eastern Pole.</p><p></p><p>"Slowly absorb it, and the sublimation of the Dao Transformation Stone will in turn promote a comprehensive improvement in your abilities. Of course, if you want to maximize the potential of the Dao Transformation Stone, you may need to match it with other wondrous objects."</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's majestic voice echoed in the great hall: "The foundation of the Five Elders Council is the ten immortal sects of the past. The name is gone but the reality remains, and there are countless treasure vaults inside. On this trip, you may invite Yi Shu of the Taiyi Sect to accompany you."</p><p></p><p>"I will follow the master's orders." Sun Erlang nodded and strode away.</p><p></p><p>Among the several disciples, Li Ping had the most special feelings for Sun Erlang. In addition to really wanting to borrow strength to fight strength, there was also the reason that Li Ping vaguely sensed Sun Erlang's opportunity. This kind of premonition was very mysterious and did not come from the inference of known sufficient information. Instead, it was more like the whimsical guidance that a monk would produce when he was about to break through.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the senior martial brothers and sisters all had treasures, the young Taoist Liuli couldn't help but stare at Li Ping with expectant eyes.</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing, on the other hand, had the calmest reaction among everyone. Perhaps it was because the child in her womb had not yet been born.</p><p></p><p>In Su Yuqing's mind, she recalled what Master had said to her before: "The fetus in your womb is actually the incarnation of the Heavenly Dao of this small world."</p><p></p><p>"Facing the situation of destruction, this world has borrowed your body to seek a glimmer of life. However, even if you have the Heavenly Dao of a small world on you, you are still a mortal body and too weak. Even if you are lucky enough to successfully give birth to this child, she will have difficulty growing up, and you will die."</p><p></p><p>Since that day, Su Yuqing had come to the Great Enlightenment of this Holy Dynasty with him.</p><p></p><p>As her own realm became higher and higher, the original weakness of her body gradually disappeared. And the fetus in her womb also slept more soundly.</p><p></p><p>However, Master had said that the stronger her strength was at the time of giving birth, the higher her daughter's future achievements would be. The instinct of being a mother made Su Yuqing's obsessive pursuit of cultivation realm the most stable among the six disciples.</p><p></p><p>As for fighting and establishing merit, she didn't have any particularly deep obsession.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping's thoughts locked onto the two people in the hall who had not yet been specifically arranged, and he didn't speak for a long time.</p><p></p><p>This made Taoist Liuli sense something, and she panicked in her heart, directly lowering her head and withdrawing her expectant gaze.</p><p></p><p>"You two have compatible personalities. Staying together will be mutually beneficial. And because of your special physiques, it is not suitable to have too much contact with the air of killing..."</p><p></p><p>"I recently opened up a special small world, so you two come and help inside."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Taoist Liuli immediately made a bitter face.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because she was raised by Zhong Shentong that her temperament was extremely similar to Zhong Shentong's. If there was no external force to compel her, she would be quite lazy. Since Li Ping had accepted her as a disciple, he naturally wanted to reverse this bad habit.</p><p></p><p>After Ou Shangtian left, Liuli and Su Yuqing followed Li Ping to the newly opened small world.</p><p></p><p>"Master, it's too dark here. Liuli is a little scared." Liuli deliberately said in a pitiful tone, biting her words unclearly.</p><p></p><p>However, this was not Liuli deliberately acting pitiful, but because this world was indeed different from ordinary small worlds, without a trace of light. This was because it was a special world jointly created by Li Ping, Tian Yang, and Xu Ke specifically for the Youzu people.</p><p></p><p>"Yuqing, besides the darkness, have you felt any other differences here?" Li Ping asked slowly, ignoring Liuli's act of pity.</p><p></p><p>In the absolute darkness, quiet and peaceful, even the activity of the fetus in Su Yuqing's womb decreased, as if hypnotized, gradually falling into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing felt the emotions coming from her daughter, and after a while, she frowned and replied, "The Heavenly Dao of the small world here... is not complete yet? Or rather, it simply doesn't exist?"</p><p></p><p>"It's just a large space. In the disciple's view, it is not enough to be called a world."</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing was indeed extraordinarily talented, sensing the abnormality here in just a moment.</p><p></p><p>Li Ping smiled: "You only got half of the answer right. Initially, it's not that there was no consciousness of the Heavenly Dao of the small world here. Although it was very weak, it did exist."</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing was stunned when she heard this, and was about to ask where the world's Heavenly Dao had gone.</p><p></p><p>But then she saw a golden cube suddenly appear in front of her. The dazzling light illuminated the entire dark small world.</p><p></p><p>And after sensing the somewhat familiar aura in the cube, Su Yuqing suddenly felt an instinctive fear that she could not suppress.</p><p></p><p>The fetus in her womb was also frightened awake and became restless.</p><p></p><p>Because what was sealed in this golden cube was the consciousness of the world's Heavenly Dao, which had the same essence as her!</p><p></p><p>"They all have gifts, so naturally you won't be left out." Li Ping could naturally feel Su Yuqing's fear.</p><p></p><p>"This place needs to be under the absolute control of your master, and there is no need for the existence of the world's Heavenly Dao consciousness, so I separated and sealed it."</p><p></p><p>"Now it's given to you." Li Ping said lightly.</p><p></p><p>[Please move your finger and share this website to Facebook, so that we can continue operating]</p>

            <p>Chapter 1153: The Immortal Heart Falls into the Mortal World</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that Li Fan intentionally concealed that person's figure. {What? You still don't know | Read COM, read chapters without errors | Hurry up and google it}</p><p></p><p>Rather, the mysterious figure that appeared at the bottom of the Chizha Abyss was too overbearing, and the already unstable environment at the bottom of the abyss simply couldn't accommodate the existence of such a realm.</p><p></p><p>As a result, it led to a blurry view from the outside.</p><p></p><p>However, judging from the aura that the figure inadvertently revealed, Li Fan had more than half the confidence to determine that the person was the Dharma Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"But it's a bit different from the impression of the weathered old man, seeming to be younger. What's going on here?"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Shao Jun also came back to his senses from his thoughts and transmitted a message: "I know how to invite the Heavenly Venerable back, but relying solely on a blurry image..."</p><p></p><p>"It's not enough. We need more evidence."</p><p></p><p>"Even with just the two of us, we can't directly submit the evidence we've collected to him. To persuade him would be even more difficult."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan heard Shao Jun's apprehension and responded with a smile: "Shao Jun, there's no need to be overly pessimistic. Indeed, the two of us are weak. But in the vast Xuanhuang Realm, we should still be able to find like-minded people."</p><p></p><p>"We can collect evidence while looking for reliable people to strengthen ourselves." From Li Fan's words, he already had the intention of taking Shao Jun along with him.</p><p></p><p>"But the Chizha Abyss..." Shao Jun still had some hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately advised with a serious expression: "As the saying goes, if the skin doesn't exist, where will the hair attach? If the entire Xuanhuang Realm falls into a crisis, even if you suppress the abyss here and ensure peace, what's the use?"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, I've already thought of a way to suppress the demonic sounds of the abyss even if you travel far away, achieving both goals."</p><p></p><p>As the two were talking, they had already returned to the entrance of the abyss.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes focused, and a giant sword seemingly composed of tens of thousands of different sword lights instantly spanned across the abyss.</p><p></p><p>Pointing in the air, the giant sword nimbly flipped and flew with Li Fan's movements.</p><p></p><p>Correspondingly, strands of continuous dark red threads were cut off.</p><p></p><p>Without the restraint of the original world's rules, these threads should have scattered and dissipated in a disorderly manner.</p><p></p><p>But under Li Fan's hand gestures in the air, they slowly gathered together.</p><p></p><p>Quietly weaving into a giant red net!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Shao Jun's heart trembled slightly once again.</p><p></p><p>Although it wasn't as shocking as the mysterious figure's ability to manipulate the broken world with a wave of his hand, this effortless act of weaving the broken laws of the world into a net was enough to demonstrate Li Fan's unattainable mastery of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"The reason why the demonic sound tide is difficult to guard against is because the conflicts between the laws of the broken world and the Xuanhuang Realm are all focused in this narrow area, making it too intense without any buffer. So I slightly changed the spatial structure here to delay the time of law fusion to the greatest extent..."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, that mysterious figure could have easily done this with a wave of his hand, concealing the traces to avoid being discovered as abnormal. But he didn't do so. Perhaps this is also a kind of confidence." Li Fan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"With the buffer of this rule net, the power of the erupting demonic sound tide is expected to be reduced by half."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan spoke, he gently pinched, once again transforming the giant sword in the abyss into</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The myriad sword lights formed countless sword shadows, which, according to a certain pattern, seemed to soar like flying dragons, vaguely forming a formation.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun saw that the sword formation was swirling around the periphery of the web of rules, and the center seemed to form a huge vortex.</p><p></p><p>"This formation, with the sword intent of destroying everything, stirs and shatters the remnant rules accumulated in the depths of the abyss. It can extend the eruption cycle of the demonic sound tide by more than twice."</p><p></p><p>"Shaojun can command the sword cultivators in the Qingxuan Army to come here, not only to comprehend the condensed sword intent in the formation but also to help charge the sword formation..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, in a leisurely manner, had already laid out the solution to the demonic sound tide that had made the Qingxuan Army change color.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun looked at the formation and the web, speechless.</p><p></p><p>He had been called a genius by those around him since he was a child.</p><p></p><p>But in front of Li Fan...</p><p></p><p>"It turns out that there are always people better than you. I was shallow before."</p><p></p><p>With the worries behind him resolved, Shang Shaojun naturally had no reason to refuse to accompany Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The two returned to the Eternal Immortal Fortress and announced the news that the demonic sound tide had been temporarily suppressed, which led to cheers from the Qingxuan Army that shook the mountains and seas.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, Shang Shaojun also gathered his confidants and passed down the method of manipulating the "Sound Destruction Sword Formation" named by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>With everything properly arranged, before leaving, Shang Shaojun also summoned Yan Huan alone.</p><p></p><p>"Shaojun, please rest assured. The techniques deduced by Yanfa Jue are very effective. Those brothers who occasionally lost their minds before have rarely had episodes recently," Yan Huan replied respectfully with his head lowered.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>From their conversation, Li Fan also learned the reason why Yan Huan was in such a hurry and did not hesitate to consume a precious Jinfayu tablet to find Yanfa Jue to deduce the techniques.</p><p></p><p>The Qingxuan Army had been guarding outside the Chizha Abyss for many years and was imperceptibly influenced by the demonic sound. Some of them would become mentally deranged and even commit the crazy act of drawing swords against their comrades.</p><p></p><p>In the past, there were fewer people who got sick, and it was relatively easier to deal with.</p><p></p><p>But with the accumulation of time, now nearly one-fifth of the Qingxuan Army in the Severed Palm Immortal City had been infected with this strange disease.</p><p></p><p>Just before the Holy Fetus Li Fan arrived here, there had been a large-scale outbreak in the Qingxuan Army.</p><p></p><p>The casualties were heavy.</p><p></p><p>The key point was that they did not die from the demonic sound tide but at the hands of their own brothers, which was especially hard to accept.</p><p></p><p>The morale of the Qingxuan Army was low, and the military spirit was scattered.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun had no choice but to use his hard-earned Jinfayu tablet to ask Yanfa Jue to solve this matter.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Tempering Heart and Dispelling Demons Technique' allows the cultivator to help others strengthen their Dao heart and dispel the evil thoughts in their minds. Although it can only solve one person's hidden worries at a time and the efficiency is a bit slow, it is indeed very effective. The soldiers who have recovered have even developed a slight resistance to the demonic sound," Shang Shaojun introduced to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"How does this Tempering Heart and Dispelling Demons Technique compare to the secret technique I taught you, Shaojun?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun was slightly stunned, and then blurted out, "It's far inferior!"</p><p></p><p>"Then Shaojun, why don't you pass down the 'Immortal Heart Mantra'? To prevent everyone from suffering the disturbance of the demonic sound," Li Fan said with a look of compassion, transmitting his voice.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shang Shaojun's eyes widened instantly, and his heart was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Heart Mantra..."</p><p></p><p>He finally learned the name of that supreme secret technique. The two words "Immortal Heart" made him lost in wild imaginations.</p><p></p><p>While surprised by Li Fan's generosity, Shang Shaojun actually felt a little reluctant to pass on such a secret technique to everyone unconditionally.</p>

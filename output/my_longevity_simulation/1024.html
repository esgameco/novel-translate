        <h1>Chapter 1024</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1022 - Fleecing the Heavenly Mirror Again</p><p></p><p>In order to prevent inconsistencies between the dream and reality, Li Fan specially sectioned off a piece of land in the Spirit Wood Realm to serve as a dwelling place for these Medicine King Sect disciples. </p><p></p><p>With the isolation of the formation, it was ensured that there would be no accidents to disturb them.</p><p></p><p>"After all, there is still a slight gap between the dream and reality. So they can't handle things that are too delicate. But if it's just hard labor similar to providing Evergreen Essence, there shouldn't be a problem." Liu Ruchen observed for a while and then commented.</p><p></p><p>"As long as an appropriate amount of Evergreen Essence is added when refining any elixir, it will increase the probability and quality of successfully producing the elixir. So the more Evergreen Essence, the better." Seeing the many Medicine King Sect disciples who had survived a catastrophe and were now full of hopes for the future in the dream, a trace of reluctance flashed in Liu San's eyes.</p><p></p><p>But he also knew that this was the best treatment he could fight for them at present, so he just echoed Liu Ruchen's words.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan, who could see through people's hearts, clearly sensed the thoughts in the minds of the Medicine King Sect's Dao-attained elders present. </p><p></p><p>It is said that things of the same kind injure each other, which is human nature. Li Fan did not force them too much, but opened his mouth to promise: "It's just an expedient measure! Rest assured, we will definitely not let these disciples be immersed in the dream for too long."</p><p></p><p>Everyone didn't know whether to believe it or not, but they all praised Li Fan's compassion in unison.</p><p></p><p>"In ancient immortal cultivation sects, the elders almost all climbed up step by step from the bottom, with rich experience in fighting." Li Fan smiled in response, but his heart was not deceived by the appearances these people displayed.</p><p></p><p>"But it's not a big problem. They have all bowed before the faceless true immortal statue and are all locusts on the same boat."</p><p></p><p>The problems of the elders and lower-level disciples had been solved, and the next thing that needed to be arranged were the thirty elite disciples on the list.</p><p></p><p>Including Liu Ruchen's adopted son, Liu Yihang, the thirty people were all outstanding among the younger generation of the Medicine King Sect.</p><p></p><p>Even in Li Fan's current view, they could be called quite talented.</p><p></p><p>It was time to use people, and it would be a pity if they were always asleep.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan contacted Mo Rubin again and asked him for a hundred different cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>Although cultivation techniques were one of the most precious resources in the Xuan-Huang Realm, those who had already reached the peak of domination, the Dharma Transmitters, naturally would not lack them.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan roughly described to Mo Rubin the process of finding the Medicine King Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>Although Mo Rubin was a little surprised by Li Fan's good luck, he didn't pay much attention to it.</p><p></p><p>After handing over a hundred Hua Shen level cultivation techniques to Li Fan, he warned: "You can play with them, but don't delay the important matters. I have already obtained the support of the vast majority of Dharma Transmitters, and Cang has also made corresponding preparations on his side."</p><p></p><p>"The resolution of 【Sealing the Spirits of Xuan Tian】 will be officially passed soon, so Brother Xingwang, you must prepare in advance."</p><p></p><p>Sensing the deduction progress of the Final Dissociation Disk in his sea of consciousness, Li Fan waved his hand: "I do things, you can rest assured, there will definitely be no mistakes!"</p><p></p><p>"Well... I'll go find the Heavenly Mirror again later. After all, it's about its regaining freedom, so it can't be a hands-off shopkeeper." Li Fan muttered and hurriedly took his leave.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin looked at Li Fan's disappearing figure and sighed.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the hidden immortal's cave, Li Fan went straight to Weidou City in Liuguang Prefecture, where the Heavenly Mirror's avatar was located.</p><p></p><p>It had been a while since they last met, and it had already changed its identity.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>No longer a waiter, but now the owner of the inn.</p><p></p><p>Smiling and greeting the guests in the store.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, everything froze, and the avatar of Tian Xuan Mirror immediately withdrew the smile from his face.</p><p></p><p>"I'm here to report the progress of the plan to you." Li Fan first stated his intention.</p><p></p><p>"Speak directly, you shouldn't have come all this way just for this small matter." The avatar of Tian Xuan Mirror said lazily.</p><p></p><p>"The one who knows me is Tian Xuan." Li Fan gave a thumbs up and praised.</p><p></p><p>"You and I should cooperate externally and put on a good show of stealing the limelight in front of the Wan Xian Alliance, which shouldn't be a problem. But I still have a few concerns."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said solemnly: "First, if the prohibition on the transmission of the Dharma is lifted, will the Dharma Heavenly Venerable himself sense it?"</p><p></p><p>"If He becomes aware of the anomaly in the Xuan Huang Realm and returns in an instant..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid our painstaking plans will be in vain in an instant!"</p><p></p><p>The avatar of Tian Xuan Mirror remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then said, "Second, if everything goes smoothly and the Dharma is not alerted, and you regain your freedom. Where do you want to go next? Will you leave the Xuan Huang Realm, or..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's words stopped as he looked at the other party, waiting for an answer.</p><p></p><p>"For the first point, don't worry. Even if I leave, I will leave behind a secondary body as a disguise. In terms of the ability to handle matters, this secondary body is not inferior to me. And it also has a backup of almost all the data of my original body..."</p><p></p><p>"There will be no abnormalities." The avatar of Tian Xuan Mirror said lightly.</p><p></p><p>"As for the second point..."</p><p></p><p>"I haven't decided yet." The avatar of Tian Xuan Mirror said frankly.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's because I've been trapped for so long that even if I regain my freedom, I don't know where to go for a while. But it doesn't matter, I have plenty of time to pursue what I want."</p><p></p><p>Only at this time would the eyes of the avatar of Tian Xuan Mirror reveal a trace of vicissitudes that matched his identity.</p><p></p><p>"If you're really at a loss and can't find a place to go, you can join us." Li Fan suggested with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Xuan Huang Realm is vast, it is still too small compared to the endless starry sea. Who doesn't want to walk out of this starry sky and see further?"</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was Li Fan's words that resonated with the avatar of Tian Xuan Mirror, as he subconsciously raised his head and looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were dazed, as if lost in some memory.</p><p></p><p>Silence descended between the two and lasted for a long time.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was Li Fan who broke it: "Speaking of which, what exactly is that so-called [secondary body] you mentioned?"</p><p></p><p>"It can actually give birth to an existence not much weaker than your original body..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be like how we humans reproduce offspring?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>The avatar of Tian Xuan Mirror glanced at Li Fan and shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>However, after pondering for a while, he still explained: "If you must make such an analogy, it's not wrong."</p><p></p><p>"You human cultivators constantly accumulate cultivation as time passes. I am the same. But what's different from cultivators is that the power that constructs my original body is too pure to tolerate duplicate parts. So every once in a while, I need to expel these duplicate parts from my body."</p><p></p><p>"This is the origin of the secondary body."</p><p></p><p>As the avatar of Tian Xuan Mirror spoke, a white jade ruler appeared in his hand out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>"For example, this [Liang Tian Suo] is composed of the excess ability of [Zhang Tian Liang Di] from within my body."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked towards the Liang Tian Suo and saw numerous scenes jumping faintly on it.</p>

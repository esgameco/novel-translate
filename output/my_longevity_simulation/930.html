            <p>"Since you want the cultivation techniques so badly..."</p><p></p><p>"Considering how good you are at pleasing people, I'll give them to you.

New 69 Book Bar 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>In addition to the "Heaven and Earth Confrontation Fu", "Eternal Only Me Jue" and other techniques that he already knew in advance.</p><p></p><p>There were also two cultivation techniques that he had never heard of before.</p><p></p><p>"Sitting in Oblivion Secret Canon" and "Three Perils Ghost God Dark Secrecy Record".</p><p></p><p>Li Qing was overjoyed in his heart: "Thank you, Heavenly..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, a dizziness came over him.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the scene before his eyes changed abruptly.</p><p></p><p>He was no longer inside the Grand Dao Sect, but had already been kicked out by Zhao Shijie.</p><p></p><p>He had returned to the Five Elders Society's territory.</p><p></p><p>Relying on various trump cards, he successfully exchanged the Xuantian Sect's cultivation techniques from the other party.</p><p></p><p>But Li Qing did not get carried away because of this.</p><p></p><p>He still had awe and respect for the Longevity Heavenly Venerate in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Indulging in the illusory realm was because of losing one's true self. And if he actually had a tryst with the Longevity Heavenly Venerate in reality...</p><p></p><p>I'm afraid there would be unexpected risks.</p><p></p><p>So Li Qing decisively refused.</p><p></p><p>"One must always be vigilant at all times."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing warned himself again in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He looked around, distinguishing the way back.</p><p></p><p>Although the mission had been completed, and his true body had already synchronized and learned of his experiences.</p><p></p><p>However, the contents of these few Xuantian Sect's cultivation techniques were each as vast as the sea.</p><p></p><p>It was not something that could be read through in a short time, and needed to be transported back to his true body as soon as possible. New 69 Book Bar → 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>"This place seems a bit unfamiliar, I don't know which Heavenly Venerate's territory it is in the Five Elders Society."</p><p></p><p>However, he also had no intention of finding someone to ask, Li Qing only slightly distinguished the location of his true body.</p><p></p><p>Then he sped off in the corresponding direction.</p><p></p><p>At first, just like when he came, it was very smooth.</p><p></p><p>He did not encounter any Five Elders Society disciples questioning him.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he was about to leave the border of this state, something unexpected happened.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly three figures flew up from the ground, blocking his path forward.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's heart trembled, before he could make a move, he heard one of the three people in front ask: "Who goes there? And where are you going?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing was about to open his mouth to gloss over it.</p><p></p><p>However, the words at his lips suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"I am Li Qing of the Xuantian Sect! I have infiltrated the Five Elders Society, obtained the cultivation technique, and am about to return!"</p><p></p><p>As if the words came out directly without any consideration from the brain, he just blurted out his own secrets like that!</p><p></p><p>The three disciples responsible for interrogating the Five Elders Society cultivators were stunned at first.</p><p></p><p>Then, they all showed expressions of shock and horror.</p><p></p><p>"There is..."</p><p></p><p>But before they could make any moves, a black sword shadow flashed like lightning.</p><p></p><p>It swiftly passed through the bodies of the three people.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the three cultivators were turned into a cloud of blood, leaving no trace of their corpses.</p><p></p><p>The phenomenon of cultivators falling from the sky was condensing.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing seized this opportunity and fled at a rapid speed.</p><p></p><p>"The Realm of Truth!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Zhao is really petty!"</p><p></p><p>At that moment just now, when he wanted to open his mouth to make up an excuse, it turned into his true situation.</p><p></p><p>This made Li Qing immediately realize where he was.</p><p></p><p>"The power of the True Celestial Venerable is indeed extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>While fleeing in panic, Li Qing recalled what had just happened to him and was secretly shocked.</p><p></p><p>With his mental strength, he didn't notice anything unusual throughout the entire process.</p><p></p><p>It was only when the words were spoken that he realized something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing even had a feeling that even if he knew the rules of this place now and wanted to forcibly fabricate lies, it would be absolutely impossible to do so!</p><p></p><p>This was the power to reverse the principles of heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>"Bewitching the mind is indeed the most difficult to guard against."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's heart sank, and he sped up again.</p><p></p><p>Although his whereabouts were exposed, this place was located within the Five Elders Society's territory, which had been peaceful for a long time. The defenses were not that strict. For the time being, there were no pursuers chasing after him.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, Senior Sister Zhao probably just wanted to scare him and didn't intend to harm him. Otherwise, wouldn't their transaction be in vain?</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the place where Li Qing was teleported to was only the border area of the Realm of Truth.</p><p></p><p>However, when crossing the border defense line of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, there was a small episode.</p><p></p><p>That is, during the time he went to the Five Elders Society, the border protection formations had all changed.</p><p></p><p>The flaws in the formations that his true self had previously transmitted had become invalid, causing him to nearly be discovered by the patrolling cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his true self noticed the situation here and completed the deciphering of the formations in time.</p><p></p><p>This prevented Li Qing from being exposed.</p><p></p><p>Flying again within the boundaries of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, Li Qing couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Although I obtained the cultivation technique this time, the return journey was full of twists and turns."</p><p></p><p>"Is this what they call 'good things come with hardships'? I hope there won't be any more troubles next."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this in his heart, Li Qing quickly headed towards the entrance of the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>And perhaps there really was a factor of luck in the unfathomable heavens, when he was about to reach the entrance of the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Li Qing was actually targeted by a patrolling "Heavenly Arrow" flying overhead.</p><p></p><p>The arrow light flashed and, caught off guard, it directly pierced through Li Qing's body.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Li Qing's extraordinary strength from achieving the Heavenly Wonder of Dongtian,</p><p></p><p>And at the moment when the Heavenly Arrow was about to strike, he unleashed thousands of sword techniques to offset part of the Heavenly Arrow's power,</p><p></p><p>He might have fallen on the spot with this one strike!</p><p></p><p>Even so, Li Qing was seriously injured.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the activation of the Heavenly Arrow attracted the attention of the cultivators from the Myriad Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Lin Ling, who was ordered to come and receive him, quickly arrived and took the heavily injured Li Qing away.</p><p></p><p>By the time the cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance arrived, all they saw was a large pit and traces of blood.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Lingmu Realm.</p>

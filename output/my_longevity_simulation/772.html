        <h1>Chapter 772</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Inside the secluded cultivation chamber, Xu Bai sat cross-legged on the ground paved with exquisite spirit stones. He first placed the red rope in front of him, then took a deep breath to calm his slightly excited mood. After all, since accidentally obtaining the Pearl of the Vast Ocean years ago, he had not stumbled upon any treasures for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai narrowed his eyes and repeatedly recalled the process and details of his recent journey to the empire. "It should not be a plot by Xiao Qing and the others. This time I took the initiative to seek them out, and the request to see Xu Ke's remains was also made by me."  </p><p></p><p>"Moreover, they indeed did not know about the peculiarities of this red rope..."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time without finding any flaws, Xu Bai did not touch the red rope. Instead, he took out the Book Worm first. Like a living creature, the book flipped its pages on its own, projecting words and images above.</p><p></p><p>"Sacred Blood Embryo Refinement..."  A moment later, a glimmer of light flashed in Xu Bai's eyes. "No wonder the White Master valued him so much - the creator of the entire Beast Empire. The profundities of this Sacred Blood Embryo Refinement technique are almost unmatched by any body division arts."</p><p></p><p>The Wondrous True Spirit Transformation creates a separate body by directly refining heavenly materials and treasures into flesh and blood, then infusing it with spiritual consciousness, severing the connection between the divided body and the main body to form a completely independent entity.</p><p></p><p>However, this Sacred Blood Embryo Refinement can cultivate one's own blood essence and flesh without relying on spiritual power or consciousness at all, separating out another physical body that is completely identical to oneself. The entire process is similar to regrowing a severed limb, except what regrows is another self.  Before completely separating from the main body, the divided body remains connected to the main body by blood and flesh, resembling the human process of gestating offspring. Hence, Xu Ke called it Sacred Blood Embryo Refinement.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai then took out three items that catalyze the Sacred Blood Embryo Refinement from his storage ring: the blood of the Eternal Dragon, the Brahma Awareness Insect, and the Pure Light Nucleus.</p><p></p><p>Initially, the Sacred Blood Embryo Refinement technique passed down by Xu Ke considered that practitioners would be ordinary mortals without any cultivation base. Therefore, the gestation period for the sacred embryo, or the next generation, was quite long, basically taking about half a year while constantly consuming medicinal herbs and meat to nourish the embryo's growth.</p><p></p><p>However, over the thousands of years of the empire's history, generations of emperors researched methods to catalyze this process by utilizing the wondrous properties of various demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Dragon's blood can greatly promote the circulation of qi and blood in the body, shortening the gestation period from half a year to just one month or even days.  </p><p></p><p>The Brahma Awareness Insect can replenish mental consumption.  </p><p></p><p>The Pure Light Nucleus, when implanted into the sacred embryo, can ensure it is unaffected by disasters or illnesses during gestation.</p><p></p><p>"Everything has its pros and cons. Although borrowing external forces can greatly reduce the time needed to nurture the sacred embryo, it also creates many drawbacks. Due to the extremely rapid growth, the accelerated sacred embryo is almost indistinguishable from the main body, just as Xiao Qing said - it's almost like creating a separate body."</p><p></p><p>"However, with the original Sacred Blood Embryo Refinement method over years of gradual development, the sacred embryo would give birth to its own strand of consciousness, being more of a physical resemblance to the original rather than an exact duplicate."</p><p></p><p>"It's hard to say which is better or worse between these two."  </p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's gaze swept over the three items as he pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>"Nevertheless, this accelerated method is what I need now."</p><p></p><p>After absorbing the Eternal Dragon's blood into his belly, Xu Bai silently began operating the Sacred Blood Embryo Refinement technique. An extremely scorching sensation welled up from his abdomen.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The heat suddenly surged through his body, rushing like raging fire and spreading to every corner of his limbs in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a huge lump of flesh emerged from Xu Bai's back.</p><p></p><p>The flesh and blood tissues within it were constantly writhing, and the lump kept expanding. In the blink of an eye, it grew from the size of a fist to that of a baby.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Xu Bai was wearing the Purifying Glass Robe forged by Fang Zaijie, which could withstand the attacks of the Dao Cultivators. Otherwise, he would have had the trouble of his clothes bursting.</p><p></p><p>The sacred blood could transform into an embryo according to one's will, and any part of the body could be used as the growth point of the sacred embryo.</p><p></p><p>The emperors throughout the history of the Empire all had their own preferences. Xu Bai chose his back.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he was influenced by the scene he had witnessed when he was still a Foundation Establishment Cultivator, being chased by the Nascent Soul Cultivator with red hair, where he saw "the shadowy infant like a parasitic worm crouching behind the volcanic cave."</p><p></p><p>"There is no vigorous life force brought by the mutual generation of the Five Elements, but only the flesh and blood tissues entering a state of super-activation, breaking through the normal division limit," Xu Bai thought.</p><p></p><p>"The so-called Eternal Dragon is nothing more than a long serpent that has regressed to the bloodline of the Azure Spirit Dragon, but it still has such a significant effect on the Nascent Soul Cultivators," Xu Bai felt the itching sensation like ants crawling on his back and couldn't help but be alarmed.</p><p></p><p>The scorching Eternal Dragon's blood surged unceasingly within Xu Bai's body.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, seven days had passed.</p><p></p><p>The lump on Xu Bai's back had now vaguely taken on a "human" form.</p><p></p><p>And in Xu Bai's perception, this sacred embryo was like a part of his own body, which he could control at will.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the sacred embryo moved according to Xu Bai's will, performing various actions. However, the sacred embryo had not yet fully developed, and it looked somewhat terrifying, like a face covered with a cloth.</p><p></p><p>"It's time." After thoroughly familiarizing himself with the sacred embryo, Xu Bai's spiritual consciousness manipulated the Pure Light Core and slowly approached the lump of flesh.</p><p></p><p>The protruding flesh and blood seemed to disappear. Without any obstruction, the Pure Light Core directly penetrated into it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai clearly felt that the frenzied and disorderly proliferation of the flesh and blood tissues in the sacred embryo gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>The Pure Light Core gradually dissolved into the flesh and blood, causing the bulge on Xu Bai's back to emit a faint white glow.</p><p></p><p>The limbs, facial features, and other parts began to differentiate from the sacred embryo.</p><p></p><p>After about half a day, a smooth "human" appeared on Xu Bai's back.</p><p></p><p>He was called smooth because at this time, he not only had no hair on his body, but also no skin wrinkles. He looked like he was carved from white jade, emitting a pale luster.</p><p></p><p>"Now, it's the final step," Xu Bai said.</p><p></p><p>"My spiritual consciousness far exceeds that of ordinary people, so I don't need the Brahma Insect that supplements spiritual consumption."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai focused part of his consciousness on the sacred embryo on his back.</p><p></p><p>Activating the Sacred Blood Transformation technique, the sacred embryo underwent earth-shattering changes in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Bones formed, and the originally soft and flabby sacred embryo inflated and straightened up like a blown-up balloon.</p><p></p><p>Hair, nails, and skin on different parts of the body gradually appeared.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a master sculptor was carefully carving on the originally bald flesh.</p><p></p><p>The human characteristics of the sacred embryo became more and more pronounced.</p><p></p><p>Soon...</p><p></p><p>The face on Xu Bai's back, like a mirror image, suddenly opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the layers of flesh and blood at the connection point between the sacred embryo and the main body automatically fell off.</p><p></p><p>The sacred Xu Bai gently patted the main body on the shoulder, then lightly floated down to the ground.</p>

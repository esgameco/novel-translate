        <div class="content">
            <p>"Between life and death, there are great opportunities!"</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary people, when faced with the threat of death, will unleash powers far beyond the ordinary. New69bookshuhux.com What about us cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>The expression of Zhong Shentong became serious, solemnly stating, "The greater the pressure, the greater the force. What pressure can be stronger than death itself?"</p><p></p><p>"With the help of the brink of death, the speed of cultivation and the ability to sense will be a thousand times higher than usual."</p><p></p><p>"This is my firsthand experience, absolutely not false!"</p><p></p><p>"If fellow cultivators can harness this kind of power, they can cultivate to the Nascent Soul stage before their lifespan ends. It's definitely not difficult!"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong vowed.</p><p></p><p>"If what Senior said is true, then why are there cultivators in the world who are trapped for a lifetime and unable to break through even until death?" Li Fan said somewhat helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong paused for a moment, thought seriously for a while, and quickly came up with an answer.</p><p></p><p>"That must be because they are not afraid of death enough!"</p><p></p><p>"I see! Fellow cultivator is now transcendent and indifferent, placing life and death aside. Worries make it impossible to utilize the pressure from the brink of death for cultivation, right?" Zhong Shentong suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, in my cultivation method, 'The Profound Art of Life and Death,' there is a chapter called 'The Sensation of Life and Death.' By studying it, one can fully comprehend the value of life and the terror of death."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully observed the old Taoist in front of him.</p><p></p><p>He felt that Zhong Shentong's way of thinking was somewhat different from ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he had cultivated some kind of 'The Profound Art of Life and Death' and messed up his mind? Directly revealing his cultivated technique to someone he just met?</p><p></p><p>He replied earnestly, "Fellow cultivator's technique is extraordinary, I admire it."</p><p></p><p>"However, different techniques cannot be cultivated together. Although I appreciate your technique, I'm afraid I cannot benefit from it..."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong interrupted Li Fan nonchalantly, "That's why I came to seek you out."</p><p></p><p>"Please enlighten me, fellow cultivator, how can one place life and death aside?"</p><p></p><p>"How can one not fear death like fellow cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>"If one can overcome the fear of death, then I, an old Taoist, can surely attain liberation!"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong said urgently.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>"Zhong fellow cultivator, you..."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong waved his hand, "I know fellow cultivator may not understand. However, the truth is that I no longer wish to live."</p><p></p><p>"I have lived in this world for one hundred and sixty-eight years, witnessing all kinds of ups and downs."</p><p></p><p>"Everything in the world, to me, has lost its joy."</p><p></p><p>"For the sake of techniques, treasures, territories, and lifespan, people fight and compete..."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I just find them noisy."</p><p></p><p>"If possible, I would have put an end to my own life long ago."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, a hint of helplessness flashed in Zhong Shentong's eyes. "But the 'The Profound Art of Life and Death' that I practice has made it impossible for me to confront the instinctual fear of death within me."</p><p></p><p>"Every time I think of ending my life, when I attempt any suicidal action, my instincts compel me to do things against my will. New69bookshuhux.com"</p><p></p><p>"To avoid cultivation, I even thought of passing on my techniques to other cultivators to practice."</p><p></p><p>"But often, not long after, feeling my cultivation speed slowing down, as if death was drawing nearer, I would lose my rationality and seek out the other person and kill them."</p><p></p><p>"So, upon hearing about fellow cultivator's fearlessness towards death, I came from afar to seek guidance." Zhong Shentong spoke earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>If Li Fan was someone who sought immortality persistently, then Zhong Shentong was someone who had lived enough to welcome death willingly.</p><p></p><p>However, he tragically found himself bound by his own techniques, unable to act according to his desire to end his life, leading to a painful situation akin to mental split.</p><p></p><p>"Could you not even self-dissipate?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong smiled bitterly and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"This 'The Profound Art of Life and Death' is truly bizarre," Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could only feel pity for Zhong Shentong's current state.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not one who was fearless of life and death - he simply never died.</p><p></p><p>If he truly faced something that could endanger his life, he would surely run faster than anyone else.</p><p></p><p>After some consideration, Li Fan earnestly said, "My situation may be of no use to fellow cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"I am just naturally carefree, with no other special qualities. However, the fear of death is inherent in humans. How did fellow cultivator overcome it?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhong Shentong's expression of not afraid of death, Li Fan was helpless and spoke offhandedly, "I am not without fear either. I just think, isn't death the real death?"</p><p></p><p>"Maybe, after death, that is when one truly lives, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"Fellow cultivator, have you heard of the story of the 'Brain in the Cauldron' or the rumor of the 'Real Dream Realm'?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said as he thought, capturing Zhong Shentong's attention more and more.</p><p></p><p>"One sentence from you is worth a hundred years of wisdom."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, death is not the end but the beginning of a true new life." After hearing Li Fan's words, Zhong Shentong seemed to fall into a trance, muttering to himself.</p><p></p><p>"No need to fear at all..."</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, a sense of relief suddenly appeared on Zhong Shentong's face, as if he had attained great enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>However, a dangerous multi-colored light suddenly emerged from his body.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong himself let out a cold laugh, "Trying to scare me. I have already understood."</p><p></p><p>"It's all just an illusion, death is life, only through death can there be life!"</p><p></p><p>As the multi-colored divine light accelerated, Li Fan felt something amiss and quietly retreated.</p><p></p><p>"Penetrate everything, foresee reality!"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong raised his right palm, his expression resolute, about to strike down on his own head.</p><p></p><p>"Zhong fellow cultivator! 'The Sensation of Life and Death'!" Li Fan shouted.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong's movement suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>With a gentle finger-point, a jade slip flew towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Li Fan fellow cultivator, I will go first!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Zhong Shentong continued to press down fiercely.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, his left palm, however, uncontrollably stretched out and blocked in front of his right palm.</p><p></p><p>"Dare to obstruct my path? Die!"</p><p></p><p>A rainbow-colored divine light shot out from his right palm, headed straight for his left palm.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, another radiance also timely shot out from his left palm.</p><p></p><p>After the collision of the two lights, they neutralized each other.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhong Shentong himself did not stop, muttering curses under his breath.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like there were two mortal enemies within him, fighting each other with different moves, a battle between himself and himself.</p><p></p><p>The rainbow divine light spread widely, stirring up the defensive formation within the stronghold.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the commotion inside, He Chen rushed in.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the frenzied Zhong Shentong, he looked somewhat shocked at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shrugged, indicating for him not to act recklessly.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the internal battle within Zhong Shentong's body grew fiercer.</p><p></p><p>The small stronghold could no longer contain him.</p><p></p><p>As the rainbow brilliance continuously flickered, he disappeared into the deep white mist of elemental consumption.</p><p></p><p>Inside the stronghold, people who witnessed the incident were discussing in confusion.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Li Fan quietly entered the secluded cultivation chamber and began reading the jade slip that Zhong Shentong had handed him earlier.</p>

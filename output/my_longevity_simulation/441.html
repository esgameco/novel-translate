            <p>The woman in green smirked as she appraised Li Fan, while Li Fan himself was deep in thought. Is it true or false? Is it a test, or a fabricated lie used as a bargaining chip? In a flash of electricity, Li Fan quickly analyzed. Assuming the other party had already discovered he was a complete fraud, they should not still be wasting time here, explaining anything. The logical choice would be to run away directly, or set a trap to catch and interrogate him. In other words, to a large extent, this woman in green currently couldn’t quite figure out his identity. After all, in the history of the mysterious yellow realm, there had been an actual incident where the small worlds united and counterattacked the realm of cultivating immortals. Whether the small worlds and the mysterious yellow realm were truly in the same timeline, if he truly was the "Enforcer of the Ten Thousand Realms Union," then he would not be unaware. In matters concerning the life and death of the empire's future, this "Saint" should not fabricate a lie that could easily be exposed. So, this meant that what she said was very likely the truth. At least in the eyes of the woman in green. A question naturally arose. Since the small worlds and the mysterious yellow realm were not in the same timeline, then when faced with the threat of the "Immortal Land," why didn't the group of cultivators in the mysterious yellow realm choose to escape to various small worlds through the Immortal Extinction Passage and then cut off contact with the mysterious yellow realm? If there were possibilities like infant transformation, nascent soul formation, and unity realm practitioners lacking sufficient spiritual energy and abilities to sever the connection, then for the Heavenly Transcendents, these limitations could almost be ignored. So why didn't the Heavenly Transcendents run away? The answer to this question was nothing but not afraid, not willing, and unable. Not afraid? In the previous life, the "Monolithic Heavenly Transcendent" chose to retreat when faced with the threat of the soul-locking array. This indicated that even the strong in the divine realm could not preserve themselves in the Immortal Land. This possibility could thus be ruled out. Not willing? Righteous and fearless, life and death unbroken. Falling together with the mysterious yellow realm? From the perspective of the cultivation path in this realm today, this would definitely not be the choice of these few Heavenly Transcendents. Then only one answer remained. The Heavenly Transcendents could not leave the mysterious yellow realm? At the moment this thought emerged, Li Fan felt absurd and ridiculous. The strength of the Heavenly Transcendents in the divine realm was terrifying. How could it be possible… Yet Li Fan suddenly froze. What if, what if this were true? Li Fan had always had a question. Why could one go against the order of the heavens and earth and achieve longevity? All beings in the world have an end. Even the rumored long-lived species only lived slightly longer than ordinary creatures. If there was anything in the mysterious yellow realm that truly deserved the title of "longevity," it was probably only the heaven and earth themselves. Why could one go against the order of the heavens and earth and undergo a complete transformation? Accompanying the lifespan of the heavens and earth with the body of a cultivator? "The order of the heavens and earth, going against the order of the heavens and earth…" Suddenly, a scene flashed through Li Fan's mind. In the previous life, when Ji Hongdao faced the aggressive Zhao Senior Sister, he had said, "After attaining Heavenly Lordship, one should no longer engage in worldly disputes." "Heavenly Lordship." These two words were like a lightning bolt that broke through the fog, making Li Fan notice the point that he had always overlooked. Be carefree and joyful, adhere to the cultivation methods of the Metropolitan Heavenly Lord. These rules contradicting common sense now truly existed in the world. This meant that… after reversing the original order of the heavens and earth, the path to enlightenment of the Heavenly Lords had taken its place and become the new order of the heavens and earth, becoming a part of the world. It was precisely because of this that the Heavenly Lords gained a lifespan as eternal as the heaven and earth. Before the Heavenly Transcendents, the cultivators were like robbers plundering a house at will. They stole the furnishings and treasures from inside the house. But some insatiable ones started to attract attention to the house itself. Wanting to seize control and claim the house as their own. Though they succeeded, they triggered the house's ultimate defense mechanism. The door slammed shut, making them the owners of the house but also permanently trapped inside it. "Is this the retaliation of the heavens and earth?" Li Fan suddenly realized. Previously, Li Fan already understood one thing. Faced with the powerful Heavenly Transcendents who could threaten themselves, the heaven and earth did not lack resistance. Aside from sudden laws like the impossibility of cultivating the same immortal law, and the descent of the essence of the heavens and earth executing their duty targeting ordinary cultivators. Faced with Heavenly Transcendents powerful enough to threaten themselves, the heaven and earth chose an extreme response. That response was "if you can't beat them, join them." One couldn't help but say, this tactic indeed worked. Because after achieving Heavenly Transcendence, their faction status changed from cultivators to the heaven and earth itself. Cultivators plundering the heavens and earth, if not controlled, could eventually exhaust and decay the heaven and earth. Thus, the Heavenly Transcendents who were already one with the world had to act to stop such occurrences for their own safety. Hence, there was a need to artificially control the number of cultivators. This was one of the reasons for not having too many cultivators. Li Fan also recalled the time when the ten sects of the Dao of Immortals put a reward on the Mysterious Heaven Mirror. Claiming that with just this mirror, anyone could exchange a seat for the fruit of immortality. "It seems that the realm of longevity in ancient times likely stole the original theory of longevity between heaven and earth using some method." Li Fan thought to himself. Through this pondering, Li Fan felt a slight disappointment. The Heavenly Lords in the mysterious yellow realm and his idealized concept of "longevity" seemed to still have some distance to go. They merely borrowed the power of the heavens and earth to obtain a lifespan that was not truly theirs. "Pseudo-longevity…" "However, strictly speaking, this isn't something particularly difficult to accept." "After all, the 'realm of longevity' in this realm was just an attempt by cultivators in the mysterious yellow realm to extend their lives after the Immortal path was cut off." "Moreover, perhaps there can be further progress." Li Fan thought of the Metropolitan Heavenly Lord who had disappeared in the previous life. "This pioneer of initiating new laws might have taken a step ahead and broken free from the worldly constraints." "No wonder in the previous life, the Metropolitan Heavenly Lord had been missing for thousands of years. The Heavenly Lords of the Five Elders Association also never acted during the intermittent wars. Because to the Heavenly Lords of the Five Elders Association, if the realm of longevity could not leave the mysterious yellow realm, then the Metropolitan Heavenly Lord must still be somewhere. It was merely a matter of restraining them with a mere agreement. Until later, they finally found something wrong. This led them to anxiously act and probe by themselves." The effect of the enlightening pill had not completely disappeared. In a moment of divine inspiration and through a fortuitous coincidence, Li Fan deduced a possible, factually logical truth about the mysterious yellow realm from the inadvertently pointed-out fact by the woman in green.</p>

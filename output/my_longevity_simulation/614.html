        <h1>Chapter 614</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Our plan to escape the mysterious yellow realm has failed. New Chapter 69 Bar â†’ 69 SHUX. COM." Li Fan interrupted the other person.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Liu San's expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"Father-in-law... he sacrificed himself to save us," Li Fan continued.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>Like struck by thunder, Liu San stood frozen in place.</p><p></p><p>"Master..."</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>Trembling slightly, Liu San's eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to shock the other person, "While we were asleep, thousands of years have passed in the outside world."</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>Looking somewhat dazed, Liu San glanced at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Grief, shock, confusion...</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Liu San felt his mind in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>He felt that the shock he had experienced from the beginning of his cultivation until now did not compare to today.</p><p></p><p>However, Liu San did not realize that even though the words sounded absurdly unbelievable, being spoken by Li Fan, the "young master," he had no doubts.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention a cultivator of the righteous path, even a teenager would not easily believe in others.</p><p></p><p>But this kind of thing happened to Liu San.</p><p></p><p>"The concept of longevity is truly terrifying," Li Fan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>In order to better control Liu San, Li Fan not only implanted the information that he was a disciple of the Medicine King Sect, Liu Yihang, in the "True Induction," but also added settings such as "Liu San has extreme trust in Liu Yihang."</p><p></p><p>Just to ensure everything was foolproof.</p><p></p><p>After all, even with ancient Daoist cultivation, it wasn't something that only Li Fan, with his Yuan Ying cultivation base, could contend with.</p><p></p><p>Next, he wanted to smoothly take over the Medicine King Sect, and to do that, he needed to firmly control Liu San.</p><p></p><p>There are currently six Daoist cultivators sleeping inside the Medicine King Cauldron. Li Fan chose Liu San because he valued his "loyalty."</p><p></p><p>His status could be seen from the title "young master" referring to Liu Yihang.</p><p></p><p>Liu San was an orphan rescued by Liu Ruchen accidentally in his youth.</p><p></p><p>Growing up under Liu Ruchen's care, all his cultivation and techniques were imparted by Liu Ruchen.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that between Liu Ruchen and him, they were both master and servant, as well as mentor and disciple.</p><p></p><p>Liu San was also someone who valued loyalty and repaid kindness. Even though he had achieved success in cultivation and entered the Daoist path, Liu Ruchen had repeatedly advised him.</p><p></p><p>But he always considered himself as the "old slave" and was extremely loyal to Liu Ruchen.</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruchen also valued him more and when he traveled, he entrusted the routine affairs of the Medicine King Sect to Liu San.</p><p></p><p>Such a character, even though his strength was only average among the six Daoist cultivators, was the first target Li Fan considered controlling.</p><p></p><p>These thoughts passed through his mind in an instant. Facing Liu San's bewildered question, Li Fan also showed a sorrowful expression, "Come with me, Old Liu, you will see..."</p><p></p><p>Then, Li Fan led Liu San to the core room of the Medicine King Cauldron, where he played the video of what happened after the Medicine King Cauldron flew out of the mysterious yellow realm, and the image of Liu Ruchen choosing to sacrifice himself to save the entire sect.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>The grown man Liu San burst into tears, wailing loudly on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained silent by the side.</p><p></p><p>When Liu San slowly controlled his inner grief, Li Fan continued to play Liu Ruchen's final words.</p><p></p><p>Listening to Liu Ruchen's voice before his death, Liu San's eyes became moist again.</p><p></p><p>But this time, he did not cry out loud, but listened carefully to every word as if wanting to etch it into his heart forever.</p><p></p><p>When the video of the will disappeared, after a long time, Liu San barely managed to compose himself.</p><p></p><p>"Ten sects of immortality..." he gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan sighed softly, "Although the Ten Sects of Immortality are despicable, now even if we want to seek revenge, I'm afraid we are helpless."</p><p></p><p>Liu San froze, "Young Master, what do you mean? Wait, you just said that thousands of years have passed in the outside world?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded, "Yes. After I woke up, I went out to investigate and found that even though we only circled outside the Immortal Ruins, thousands of years had passed inside the mysterious yellow realm."</p><p></p><p>"The former Ten Sects of Immortality have long been wiped out and disappeared in the river of history. Now, the two major powers ruling the immortal cultivation world are the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Association."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan introduced to Liu San the information he had "inquired" about the current situation.</p><p></p><p>Truly as a Daoist cultivator, after the initial shock, Liu San quickly accepted the reality.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, you are too reckless. How could you, in such unclear circumstances, venture out alone to gather information? Now that you bear the heavy responsibility of revitalizing the Medicine King Sect, if you encounter any danger..."</p><p></p><p>"Besides, I didn't mean to wake you up..." Li Fan's expression suddenly turned serious, "Old Liu, try activating the 'Life-Saving and Life-Extending Scripture.'"</p><p></p><p>Although Liu San was somewhat puzzled, he complied.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>His face turned pale, his eyes closed, and he tried hard to contain the murderous intent inside him.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>His voice quivered slightly, indicating his inner turmoil.</p><p></p><p>"The great calamity of heaven and earth, incompatible principles cannot coexist."</p><p></p><p>"Father-in-law's premonition was correct, and the calamity is even more terrifying than imagined."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed deeply, "Even though the Ten Sects of Immortality have perished in the great calamity, only our Medicine King Sect survived."</p><p></p><p>"This is also the reason I did not wake up the disciples in the sect. If they were all awakened at once, it would probably lead to an internal massacre."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, it was only after a long time and changing my technique that I woke you up."</p><p></p><p>Liu San suppressed his shock and nodded, "In this case, the young master's considerations were thorough."</p><p></p><p>"We are now in a place called the Cloud Sea. I was fortunate to meet the cultivator in charge of the political affairs here, Zhou Qing'ang."</p><p></p><p>"With his help, I infiltrated the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance. Now, I can barely stand my ground."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slowly explained the current situation to Liu San.</p><p></p><p>"If it's just the two of us, living well in this world shouldn't be difficult."</p><p></p><p>"However, if we want to revive the Medicine King Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed lightly and shook his head, "It's extremely difficult!"</p><p></p><p>"The first problem to solve is the issue of incompatible principles. Otherwise, even if we wake up the disciples, it will only lead to more killings."</p><p></p><p>"Although there are countless techniques in the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, they require a large amount of contributions for exchange."</p><p></p><p>"Although I've worked hard for some time, I've only managed to exchange enough for the techniques to cultivate myself."</p><p></p><p>"So..."</p><p></p><p>Liu San pondered on his words.</p><p></p><p>"Longevity Pill?"</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>The Sword Heavenly Cave is different from ordinary evolved heavenly caves. </p><p></p><p>Inside, there are no mountains, rivers, or lakes, only a scene extremely similar to the inside of this sword tomb.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of swords are stuck in the ground in a chaotic and disorderly manner.</p><p></p><p>Sword energy crisscrosses and flows, forming gusts of howling sword wind. </p><p></p><p>The entire heavenly cave is a world that completely belongs to swords. It cannot tolerate any other living things.</p><p></p><p>In the sword tomb, outside the Sword Heavenly Cave, Li Qing's avatar, which had originally been smashed to pieces, slowly reappeared with a squirming of flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>"Early Yuan Ying stage." He sensed his own cultivation level and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>His realm was slightly weaker than his true body. Although his actual combat power was also incomparable, after all, he had built his foundation with the Heaven's Wonder, so crushing ordinary Hua Shen cultivators was not a problem.</p><p></p><p>However, after entering the Yuan Ying stage, Li Qing felt a subtle resistance to moving forward.</p><p></p><p>When the avatar bid farewell to the wooden sword Heaven's Wonder and returned to the Xuanhuang Realm,</p><p></p><p>That hidden malice became more obvious.</p><p></p><p>A passage of words appeared unbidden in Li Qing's mind.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Venerate's new method is truly going against the heavens. The more one receives the grace of heaven and earth, the more difficult it will be to go against the principles of heaven and earth in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Even when sacrificing the souls of heaven and earth, one will suffer multiple times the backlash from the will of heaven and earth. No matter how high one's talent is, they will basically be limited to the Hua Shen stage."</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because the birth of this black sword also had a little contribution from Li Qing. When he devoured it and turned it into a heavenly cave, he did not sense too much resistance.</p><p></p><p>But he had a premonition that this was already the limit of what heaven and earth could tolerate.</p><p></p><p>When he wanted to go a step further, to advance to Hua Shen and even merge with the Dao, he would need to completely face the malice of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Qing was not very concerned.</p><p></p><p>After all, as an avatar, his mission was not to cultivate, but to go to the Five Elders Council, to the place of [One Heart Heavenly Venerate], to retrieve the lost Xuan Tian Sect techniques.</p><p></p><p>After checking the information transmitted from his true body, due to the previous inexplicable spatial fluctuation, the Myriad Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Council were now in a rare truce period.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing slightly discerned the direction and then transformed into a black light, quickly speeding towards his destination.</p><p></p><p>As he flew, Li Qing immediately felt that it was different from before.</p><p></p><p>When his true body moved through the air, he needed to overcome the resistance between heaven and earth, as well as the head-on sword winds.</p><p></p><p>But Li Qing's body transformed into sword light, like a fish in water, perfectly blending with the surrounding environment.</p><p></p><p>Not only could the resistance be almost ignored, the consumption of flying was also astonishingly small!</p><p></p><p>"The Heaven's Wonder originally belonged to the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao. Therefore, it naturally has preferential treatment."</p><p></p><p>Flying was no longer a laborious task, but instead became a kind of enjoyment.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing felt extremely refreshed in his heart. If he wasn't afraid of attracting the attention of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, he would have to let out a long whistle to vent.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the black sword light became faster and faster, flashing across the sky.</p><p></p><p>Even if someone caught a glimpse of it inadvertently, they would only think it was their own illusion.</p><p></p><p>In front of the white fog barrier spanning heaven and earth, a squad of Myriad Immortals Alliance's Martial Arts Hall cultivators were stationed.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing did not alarm them. Relying on the information transmitted from his true body, he easily avoided the detection of the Immortal Alliance's protective formation and disappeared into the white fog.</p><p></p><p>As the buffer state between the Five Elders Council and the Myriad Immortals Alliance, the Qiwei State did not have the power of any Heavenly Venerate other than the Carefree Heavenly Venerate involved.</p><p></p><p>The reason for choosing to enter the Five Elders Council here was to avoid the [True</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>[True Nation], after passing through the Human Realm, directly reaches the One Heart Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>In the True Nation, all lies have nowhere to hide. It's clearly not a suitable place for lurking, so it's best to avoid it if possible.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, the Human Realm is much safer.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Myriad Immortal Alliance's military preparations, the Five Elders' territory seems much more peaceful.</p><p></p><p>Except for those bordering buffer states that have heavy troops stationed.</p><p></p><p>Other states seem as if they can't even feel the existence of war at all. As Li Qing walked along the way, the cultivators and mortals he encountered were all very relaxed and even a bit lazy.</p><p></p><p>This made Li Qing click his tongue in amazement, admiring the Five Elders' way of governing their subjects.</p><p></p><p>Without encountering any danger, after passing through the Human Realm, Li Qing finally arrived at the One Heart Immortal Sect's territory.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the reason for such a smooth journey, besides Li Qing's own Heaven's Wonder Dao foundation and extremely strong concealment, perhaps also had to do with him not having joined the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>If it were a cultivator from the Myriad Immortal Alliance, wanting to lurk so easily would probably be a bit difficult.</p><p></p><p>This place was called Yilv State.</p><p></p><p>Just like its name, as far as the eye could see were fertile plains.</p><p></p><p>One could even see mortal merchant caravans traveling between the cities.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the Myriad Immortal Alliance where cultivators and mortals lived separately, in each city of the Five Elders' territory, mortals and cultivators lived together.</p><p></p><p>It's just that there was a distinction between the inner and outer cities.</p><p></p><p>Mortals lived in the outer city, while cultivators resided in the inner city.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the somewhat familiar scenery around him, Li Qing pondered.</p><p></p><p>"I seem to have been here before..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he suppressed this stray thought and began to search for his target.</p><p></p><p>According to the information sent by his true self, the key to entering the real One Heart Immortal Sect was to attract the attention of [One Heart Heavenly Venerate].</p><p></p><p>The erotic picture books secretly circulating within the Five Elders were the quickest and most effective method.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing wandered around Yilv State for many days but couldn't find those daring vendors.</p><p></p><p>However, this was understandable. After all, publicly spreading these things under the Heavenly Venerate was truly punishable by beheading.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Qing was about to try his luck in another state, the usually peaceful city suddenly became lively.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's heart stirred, and he followed the crowd to the center of the commotion.</p><p></p><p>"You are Wan Zailai?!"</p><p></p><p>Several cultivators surrounded a handsome young man in white, their faces unfriendly.</p><p></p><p>"So you discovered me. But it's fine, after resting for a few days, it's time to get back to work." Wan Zailai glanced sideways at the surrounding crowd. Under the pressure of his gaze, the surrounding cultivators actually subconsciously took half a step back.</p><p></p><p>At this, the cultivators of Yilv State all lost face.</p><p></p><p>One of them, enraged by shame, said, "A mere Golden Core cultivator dares to speak wildly! Saying that we in Yilv State are all incompetent!"</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will teach you a good lesson!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Pei, you are already at the Nascent Soul stage, bullying the weak - that's not good, right?" someone couldn't help but advise.</p><p></p><p>Before the cultivator surnamed Pei could speak, Wan Zailai laughed lightly, "So what if he's a Nascent Soul cultivator? In my eyes, they are no different from chickens and dogs!"</p><p></p><p>At this, all the Yilv State cultivators present showed angry expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Good!"</p><p></p><p>"Yilv State's Pei Qingshan, please enlighten me!"</p><p></p><p>And with Pei Qingshan's words, a transparent circular structure suddenly appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Amidst everyone's exclamations, that structure resembling an arena cast down two beams of light, sucking the two contestants inside.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Heavenly Venerate's Trial Arena!"</p>

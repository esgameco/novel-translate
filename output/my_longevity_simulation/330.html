        <h1>Chapter 330</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Instead, he sent a message to Daoist Jing Xuan.</p><p></p><p>As He Zhenghao's direct superior, his status was far above He Zhenghao's.</p><p></p><p>If Lu Junyi were to be promoted to the position of Chief Commander, he should benefit greatly.</p><p></p><p>Jing Xuan did not respond for a while, and Li Fan did not urge him.</p><p></p><p>Next, he checked on the matter of the Extreme Immortal Lord's bounty for longevity treasures.</p><p></p><p>With only about eight months left until the three-year deadline.</p><p></p><p>According to rumors circulating among the people, apart from the already clear Longevity Fruit that could extend life by five hundred years and was almost firmly in first place.</p><p></p><p>The competition below was extremely fierce.</p><p></p><p>It had reached the point of inviting professional cultivators to identify and confirm the specific time of life extension, which must be accurate to the month.</p><p></p><p>"The Huasheng Longevity Fruit only lasts for three hundred years..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The temptation to use the Yanfa Jue was too great, and the competition was unimaginably brutal.</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit of a stretch. But it's impossible to find another longevity treasure."</p><p></p><p>"We can only see the fate of this world."</p><p></p><p>Closing the information on the Tianxuan Mirror, Li Fan suppressed his distracting thoughts, settled his mind, and began to cultivate in a state of self-forgetfulness.</p><p></p><p>However, not long after entering seclusion, Li Fan was interrupted by a sudden feedback of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It was endless, though not as much as the feedback from He Zhenghao and Su Xiaomei when they broke through to the Golden Core stage before.</p><p></p><p>But for Li Fan at this time, it was definitely an unexpected joy, greatly accelerating his progress in breaking through to the middle stage of the Golden Core.

The Wall of Mortals Becoming Gods indeed lives up to its name. It seems that after this matter is resolved, I can indeed go and observe it."</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was pondering, he received an ecstatic message from Xue Mu.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Fellow Daoist Li Fan, I did it!"</p><p></p><p>"I really have to thank you. If it weren't for this wondrous sight you recommended where myriad laws resonate, how could I have achieved the Golden Core with three laws?"</p><p></p><p>"I will never forget your kindness, Fellow Daoist!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly and did not respond.</p><p></p><p>"Your diligent cultivation is the best repayment to me."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Putting away the communication talisman, Li Fan once again quietly cultivated.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, after only two months, he was once again disturbed by a strong feedback of cultivation and had to stop his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This feedback was several times greater than that brought by Xue Mu.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, this person had a deeper bond with Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"This is Xiao Heng?"</p><p></p><p>"Broke through to the middle stage of the Golden Core?"</p><p></p><p>Feeling the connection coming from the underworld, Li Fan was a little surprised.

It's a pity that the distance is too far and I can't use the Formless Killing Intent to check."</p><p></p><p>"To break through again in such a short time, he must have encountered some opportunity."</p><p></p><p>With another boost, the difficulty requirement for advancement was reduced again.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that there should be no problem cultivating to the perfection of the early Golden Core stage before the deadline."</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know if the bottleneck of the small realm's Heavenly Calamity will be troublesome this time."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan threw himself back into cultivation with a hint of excitement.</p><p></p><p>However, what happened in the next few months not only brought Li Fan a bountiful harvest but also inexplicably filled his heart with a sense of trepidation.</p><p></p><p>Because in addition to Xue Mu and Xiao Heng.</p><p></p><p>In the past six months, except for Su Xiaomei and Zhang Haobo who disappeared in the ruins of the Chaoyuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao, the Yin sisters, and even Zhao Dabao and Su Changyu all broke through one after another.</p><p></p><p>This time, the amount of cultivation he fed back was far from that of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he successfully [Established Foundation with Me]?</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren dissected more than a hundred of his own corpses and only succeeded halfway.</p><p></p><p>When did Su Changyu's aptitude become so good?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, what concerned Li Fan even more was that.</p><p></p><p>If the simultaneous breakthroughs of one or two cultivators could be explained as a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>Then the large-scale occurrence of cultivators breaking through realms in such a short period of time made Li Fan suspect that some inexplicable change was happening.</p><p></p><p>To verify his guess, Li Fan couldn't care about cultivation anymore.</p><p></p><p>He started to search for information in the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Using "breakthrough" as a keyword, Li Fan found that the information appearing in the past year was indeed more frequent than before.</p><p></p><p>There were even signs of an eruption.</p><p></p><p>In the excited words of the cultivators, Li Fan learned that when they broke through this time, the vast majority of them fortunately did not encounter the bottleneck of the Heavenly Calamity.</p><p></p><p>After their cultivation was full, they naturally advanced successfully.</p><p></p><p>And this phenomenon was not an isolated case.</p><p></p><p>Even many cultivators who had been stuck at the bottleneck for years broke through the realm in this inexplicable way.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation seems to have become easier."</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators said so.</p><p></p><p>Because the number of low-level cultivators was too large, many cultivators still did not break through and advance.</p><p></p><p>So the vast majority of people just took their words as a show-off after a successful breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>They didn't take it seriously.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan didn't think so.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Myriad Immortals Alliance is in such a hurry to build the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation because it is related to this matter?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but associate these two things.</p><p></p><p>The number of cultivators cannot be too many or too few.</p><p></p><p>And the eagerness to build the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation means that something that can affect or even subvert the rule of the Myriad Immortals Alliance is about to happen.</p><p></p><p>In order to maintain their own stability, they have no choice but to adopt such an extreme formation.</p><p></p><p>"Is the number of cultivators about to get out of control due to the reoccurrence of abnormalities in heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>If the guess is true, then it is almost foreseeable that in the near future.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Council will definitely start to drastically reduce the number of cultivators through various means.</p><p></p><p>Open slaughter should be impossible.</p><p></p><p>It could be another war.</p><p></p><p>Or it could be...</p><p></p><p>As if he had thought of something, Li Fan suddenly felt a chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He stood up straight, as if he had fallen into the cold winter.</p><p></p><p>In the propaganda of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, the establishment of the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation was to root out the spies hidden by the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>The actual effect of the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation had been fully verified in Jiushan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators had great faith in its miraculous effects.</p><p></p><p>And when the Soul-Locking Formation is completed, with the appearance of those beams of light penetrating heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>All spies will have nowhere to hide.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>The core pivot of the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation is the Tianxuan Mirror surface with its own will.</p><p></p><p>What if the Tianxuan Mirror deliberately marks the pure cultivators of the Myriad Immortals Alliance as cultivators of the Five Elders Council?</p><p></p><p>Under the envelopment of the light beam, will other cultivators believe that you are innocent?</p><p></p><p>The more Li Fan thought about it, the colder his heart became.</p><p></p><p>A righteous slaughter may be coming.</p>

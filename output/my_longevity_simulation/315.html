        <h1>Chapter 315</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even its weight is more important than the previous two.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan personally laid out the core formation and tried to guide the formation pivot into it, but still couldn't get a response, he finally understood why the affinity was so important.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Tianxuan formation pivot was like a proud goddess, ignoring Li Fan's love. No matter how much effort Li Fan put in, he couldn't move her in the slightest. But the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation needed her to take effect.</p><p></p><p>Without the formation pivot, even the most massive formation is just an empty shell.</p><p></p><p>This central core formation can be said to be specially designed for her. The only purpose is to perfectly integrate the formation pivot into the Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation.</p><p></p><p>Now that the palace has been built, the main character is still reluctant to move in, which naturally makes it difficult for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The uniqueness of the formation pivot made it impossible for Li Fan to imitate the old affairs of the Langya King's Mansion back then. He tried many methods but still couldn't lead the formation pivot into the formation.</p><p></p><p>Helpless, Li Fan had to take a different approach.</p><p></p><p>Since the goddess stays still and refuses to enter the palace, Li Fan will rebuild a palace where she stays.</p><p></p><p>The already formed central core formation was dismantled and rebuilt.</p><p></p><p>With the formation pivot as the core, Li Fan spent more than two days again, constructing a brand new formation structure beside her.</p><p></p><p>"In this way, although it can't reach the degree of perfect fit, it can be barely formed."</p><p></p><p>"There is no hope for rewards in this life. I just hope the results won't be too bad."</p><p></p><p>After completing the formation, Li Fan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Li Fan's persistent dedication slightly moved the formation pivot.</p><p></p><p>After moving into the core formation area, looking at this brand new residence, it gently shifted its body.</p><p></p><p>It was this tiny movement that increased the compatibility between the formation pivot and the core area by more than double.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was overjoyed and immediately tried to communicate with the formation pivot again.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the initiative just now seemed to be her limit. After that, no matter how Li Fan operated, there was no change.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the seven-day period was up.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the barely qualified formation in front of him, Li Fan shook his head and left the assessment space.</p><p></p><p>"The formation construction part should be able to get a passing score. As for the debugging and calibration of the formation pivot, it's equivalent to handing in a blank paper. But this is also the limit that can be done in this life."</p><p></p><p>"The formation pivot doesn't give face, there's really no way."</p><p></p><p>"It is said that among the students who took the exam in the previous rounds, there was even one who could make the formation pivot take the initiative to throw herself into his arms?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if it's true or false."</p><p></p><p>After the exam, it will take two or three months to wait for the results to come out.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan temporarily left the Huanyu Academy, didn't wander around in Tianyu City, but returned to the small courtyard he had set in the Lundao Building before.</p><p></p><p>He left in a hurry when he received Ji Hongdao's summons before, so he didn't withdraw from this small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan paid a lot of deposit, even if he was not there, it was still reserved for him.</p><p></p><p>Entering the small courtyard, coming to the cultivation secret room that was said to be extremely confidential and able to block the divine sense probing of Hedao cultivators, Li Fan took out four items representing clothing, food, housing and transportation.</p><p></p><p>Placing them in the east, west, south and north respectively, he silently recited "Fusheng Xuanhuang Tianzu!" in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>It was the first time he planned to activate the ritual and enter the Fallen Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>During the closed training period, the restriction on entry had actually disappeared long ago. However, at that time he was only at the Foundation Establishment stage, in order to avoid exposing his own secrets, Li Fan still chose to endure temporarily.</p><p></p><p>Now that he has been promoted to the Golden Core realm, he can openly enter and exit the Fallen Immortal Realm without arousing suspicion from others.</p><p></p><p>But out of wariness of Ji Hongdao and others from the Formation Hall who created the [Tianxuan Soul-Locking Formation], Li Fan still chose to perform the ritual in the relatively more private Lundao Building.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Zhang, I know you are wise and mighty, please don't come again this time." Li Fan silently recited in his heart, and then the ritual started.</p><p></p><p>The process of entering this time seemed to be longer than before.</p><p></p><p>It was pitch black in front of his eyes, wandering in an unknown and inexplicable space.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan wanted to see the surrounding environment clearly, but he was in a daze and unable to concentrate. So he could only rely on feeling to distinguish the situation around him.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like being in water, but not as cold as water.</p><p></p><p>The liquid wrapped around the body made people feel warm and at ease.</p><p></p><p>Whenever there was a feeling of hunger and weakness, an energy of gentleness and tranquility would come from somewhere, making him relax and fall asleep.</p><p></p><p>The body seemed to be weaker than the Tianyang he had experienced before, and most of the time was spent in deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, after reaching the Golden Core realm, the strength of Li Fan's divine sense soared.</p><p></p><p>The time he could stay in the Fallen Immortal Realm also increased from the original half a month to more than two months.</p><p></p><p>It was almost the same as an ordinary Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p></p><p>So he didn't end this trip to the Fallen Immortal Realm miserably in his sleep.</p><p></p><p>Just like this, Li Fan kept absorbing the warm liquid around him and the peaceful energy that appeared from time to time. He felt that he was constantly getting stronger.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, when there was no more liquid around to absorb, a strange feeling surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It's time. Li Fan suddenly realized in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Driven by the instinct of the body, Li Fan began to constantly peck at the darkness in front of him with his sharp beak.</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom!"</p><p></p><p>It was a slight peck, but for Li Fan at this time, it was like the roar of the creation of the world. He tried for a long time, and Li Fan felt a little tired. But only an imperceptible crack appeared in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>A sense of dejection arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, that gentle energy appeared again, nourishing Li Fan's body, making the fatigue and weakness disappear instantly. With renewed energy, Li Fan continued the great cause of "creating the world".</p><p></p><p>When he was tired, he would rest for a while, and the gentle energy would be transmitted over, allowing him to continue. In this way, the cracks that appeared in front of him became more and more.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan could also perceive that the energy that had been supporting him seemed to be weakening.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Li Fan was lucky. Before the gentle energy was exhausted, he finally chiseled a small hole in the endless darkness.</p><p></p><p>A ray of sunlight passed through it, separating the darkness and shining on Li Fan's body. Li Fan made a concerted effort, his long beak constantly striking.</p><p></p><p>The small hole gradually became a small opening, and finally formed a big hole large enough for Li Fan to crawl out. Li Fan shook his head and squeezed towards the exit.</p><p></p><p>Sunlight, breeze, insect chirping, bird singing, fragrance of flowers and plants... In an instant, a beautiful and vast world appeared in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>But at this time, he had no time to look at this beautiful scenery, because he felt extremely hungry.</p>

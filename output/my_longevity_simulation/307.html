        <h1>Chapter 307</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Looking at their heavily injured appearances, a thread of greed couldn't help but well up in their hearts. </p><p></p><p>After all, which cultivator could resist the temptation of merging with the Dao?</p><p></p><p>Just as a strange atmosphere began spreading among the group of cultivators, the two figures in the spotlight began fighting without further ado.</p><p></p><p>The crowd discovered that without Golden Sun Immortal Venerable and Purple Cloud Immortal blocking off the world, that originally dim red flame that seemed like it would extinguish at any moment in the wind, was reigniting and becoming deep and fierce again at a visible speed.</p><p></p><p>And Zhang Zhiliang obviously also noticed this point immediately.</p><p></p><p>The immense, deep eyes overhead suddenly appeared, their cold gaze staring straight at the Red Flame. </p><p></p><p>The flickering of the flames surrounding Red Flame couldn't help but stagnate slightly, though it immediately returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>But the spectating crowd could all see that the speed of Its recovery was still affected.</p><p></p><p>Unwilling to sit and wait for death, the flames on Red Flame's body abruptly contracted, instantly reverting to the appearance of a red speck of light.</p><p></p><p>Transforming into a red streak in the sky, it arrived in front of Zhang Zhiliang in an instant. </p><p></p><p>Just at the moment it was about to pass through his body, tens of thousands of silver cubes finished arranging into a formation in the area ahead.</p><p></p><p>Specks of silver light flashed incessantly. </p><p></p><p>That red streak kept extending forward, wanting to kill Zhang Zhiliang.</p><p></p><p>But the gap of a foot seemed as distant as the ends of the earth, unable to reach.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely the Taiji Microdust Formation used earlier to trap the Immortals. </p><p></p><p>Using the same trick, it was still extremely effective.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Red Flame stopped its futile actions and transformed back into human form.</p><p></p><p>As if roaring at the sky, in an instant, hundreds of red light rays sprayed out from its body.</p><p></p><p>Intensely shooting towards different surrounding areas.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>"Boom!" </p><p></p><p>Over a hundred silver formations exploded in the firelight.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Replacement formations immediately emerged from the darkness, instantly repairing the damaged formations.</p><p></p><p>Red Flame kept launching attacks, but the speed of damaging the formations was far from catching up to Zhang Zhiliang's speed of repairing the formations.</p><p></p><p>And Zhang Zhiliang didn't have the habit of just taking hits without retaliating.</p><p></p><p>When Red Flame tried to break out of the formation, the reverse spirit gathering formation activated again.</p><p></p><p>In the sealed space, the spirit energy density plummeted once more.</p><p></p><p>Following that, countless formations flashed in succession as one formation after another was laid out in the enclosed area.</p><p></p><p>Rays of destructive light shot out from the formations, bombarding Red Flame nonstop.</p><p></p><p>Even if It could easily dodge 99 out of 100 rays, even if being hit only caused minor injuries,</p><p></p><p>The number of formations was simply too great.</p><p></p><p>The destructive light rays seemed endless, not stopping for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Injuries gradually accumulated. Red Flame, who hadn't recovered much to begin with, grew even weaker.</p><p></p><p>Poor Red Flame, despite possessing a body of martial arts, facing this seemingly endless consumption, could only lament in vain and helplessly await death.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Red Flame's figure growing dimmer and dimmer, some cultivators spectating from the sea of clouds could no longer restrain themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow daoists, Red Flame is about to vanish and Zhang Zhiliang is at the end of his rope. This is a heaven-sent opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, even if he is a Hua Shen realm cultivator, after such a series of great battles, his strength must be greatly diminished. If we charge together, we may have a chance at victory!"</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Zhiliang publicly plotted to kill the Wanxian Island Master for the sake of merging with the Dao, provoking the dignity of the Wanxian Alliance. His crimes deserve death!"</p><p></p><p>"Charge, fellow daoists!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The voices resounded from unknown origins, echoing above Wanxian Island.</p><p></p><p>They seemed to make a lot of sense.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators looked at each other, then all looked at Zhang Zhiliang in the sky, his clothes in tatters.</p><p></p><p>The silence only lasted a moment.</p><p></p><p>Before long, there were people responding.</p><p></p><p>A pitch-black iron claw soared up from the island, reaching Zhang Zhiliang in the blink of an eye and fiercely grabbing.</p><p></p><p>As if a rallying cry, this black iron claw sounded the collective attack on Zhang Zhiliang.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, thousands of light flashed from below, flying towards the sky together.</p><p></p><p>His figure disappeared in a flash as tens of thousands of formations also activated rays of light to block the attacks.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow daoists, first attack that giant eye in the sky!"</p><p></p><p>With a loud shout, countless more lights rushed into the sky, flying towards the giant eye.</p><p></p><p>The trapped Red Flame also seemed to see this rare opportunity and launched a counterattack.</p><p></p><p>Flames kept erupting from its body as formation after formation exploded.</p><p></p><p>Facing the joint attacks of Red Flame and the other cultivators, Zhang Zhiliang also gradually had some difficulty and knew he couldn't drag it out any longer.</p><p></p><p>Abruptly appearing behind Red Flame, a silver cube also appeared in front of it.</p><p></p><p>Followed by ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand...</p><p></p><p>But unlike before, the formations did not gather together.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they began to fuse.</p><p></p><p>Countless silver cubes became ethereal in an instant.</p><p></p><p>At the position of the first formation, they began to overlap.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to only take a moment to complete the fusion.</p><p></p><p>Those dazzling formations filling the sky merged into one in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Infinite Dharma..." Li Fan's clone couldn't help feeling shocked in his heart seeing that glittering formation in the sky emitting a faint golden light.</p><p></p><p>A formation was composed of hundreds of formations stacked together.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's current attainment in formations could barely create half a formation.</p><p></p><p>Precisely because of this, he understood even more what a terrifying matter it was for Zhang Zhiliang to so easily overlap the tens of thousands of formations that had already stacked hundreds of formations and fuse them from a myriad into one.</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Zhiliang's attainment in formations in this life has probably reached the pinnacle. It far surpasses his previous life."</p><p></p><p>The thought flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, that completed golden formation emitted a heaven-shaking, earth-shattering white light.</p><p></p><p>"Perish!"</p><p></p><p>With Zhang Zhiliang's furious shout, the white light engulfed everything blocking the way.</p><p></p><p>Even from a great distance, the crowd could feel the terrifying destructive power in that light beam and couldn't help but stop their attacks.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared intently at the sky.</p><p></p><p>The countless cultivators in the sea of clouds also held their breaths.</p><p></p><p>The white light gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Red Flame's figure had vanished.</p><p></p><p>Only Zhang Zhiliang remained, standing proudly with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>The incessantly flickering red flames replaced his originally tattered clothes.</p><p></p><p>The aura of a Dao-Merging Immortal Venerable descended from the sky, proclaiming that he, Zhang Zhiliang, had successfully merged with the Dao!</p><p></p><p>The sea of clouds was completely silent.</p><p></p><p>The gazes of all living beings were now focused on him.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Zhiliang revealed a smile, his mouth slightly open, about to say something.</p><p></p><p>Right at this moment...</p><p></p><p>His head exploded with a bang.</p><p></p><p>The headless body turned slightly as if still wanting to check something.</p><p></p><p>But specks of ink spread from his wound, devouring everything.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 739</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After roughly understanding the origins of the matter, Xu Bai did not hurry to make a fuss. Instead, he first notified the people at the Tianliang Prefecture Garrison, temporarily sealing off Mount Wuliang and bringing back Fu Xingchi and the other two, detaining them. Then he remained inactive, patiently waiting for Tianliang City Lord Nangong Shirong to return.</p><p></p><p>After all, since he had given special instructions before leaving, as his subordinate, Xu Bai should also abide by them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover... </p><p></p><p>Over the years, the matter of Wuliang Wall swallowing cultivators and causing many to disappear, to be honest, is also not unrelated to his superior Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After all, before becoming the Tianliang City Lord, Nangong Shirong held the position of Tianliang Prefecture Garrison Commander. Such a major incident occurred within his jurisdiction, yet he remained unaware...</p><p></p><p>If he were to be criticized, no matter what, the charge of dereliction of duty would be unavoidable. Nangong Shirong had only recently become the city lord, his foundation still unstable. At the time, he had risen to power by stepping on Xiang Rongxin, offending many people. If he were to make a misstep and expose a weakness, it might invite a concerted attack. It was possible that before he could even warm the seat of the city lord, he would be ousted.</p><p></p><p>As his trusted aide, Xu Bai naturally had to share the burden for the city lord.</p><p></p><p>Secretly backing up the data on the disappearance incidents over the years, Xu Bai then went to the Bureau of Administration to receive Guan Xingxiu, who had come to demand an explanation.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the lazy appearance Xu Bai had seen of him in Lanlin Prefecture last time, this Guan Xingxiu was like a drawn sword, unabashedly emanating his sharp aura.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior Guan," Xu Bai cupped his hands in salute.</p><p></p><p>"Do you now have a clue about the whereabouts of Chang Ge?" Guan Xingxiu looked at Xu Bai's appearance, his eyes narrowing slightly. His originally aggressive words also unconsciously became more soothing.</p><p></p><p>"We have found a lead. I believe we will be able to give Senior a response very soon," Xu Bai replied calmly.</p><p></p><p>"With such low efficiency, if this were in Tianyu Prefecture, you all would have been dismissed and investigated long ago," Guan Xingxiu snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai lowered his head without answering.</p><p></p><p>"I'll give you seven more days. If by then, there still isn't a definite result..." </p><p></p><p>A golden flying sword suddenly shot out, hovering above the Bureau of Administration.</p><p></p><p>"Don't blame me for not showing any mercy!" Guan Xingxiu's voice was icy, his figure gradually disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Only the golden little sword was left, radiating a stern killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"The Falling Star Sword..."</p><p></p><p>The palpable killing intent almost pierced Xu Bai's skin, forcing him to temporarily distance himself. He looked up at the golden flying sword above, and it was as if he saw it soaring through the air, the stars falling.</p><p></p><p>This sword, he was not unfamiliar with.</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, when he and Huangfu Song went to Lanlin Prefecture to popularize the construction of the Heavenly Mysterious Locking Formation, they had also invited Guan Xingxiu's "Falling Star Sword" to subdue the uncooperative local cultivators in Lanlin Prefecture. At that time, although Guan Xingxiu had already fallen to the Nascent Soul realm, relying on this golden flying sword, he had encountered no obstacles, even forcing the cultivators at the Dao Ancestor level to avoid his blade.</p><p></p><p>This was enough to demonstrate the extraordinary nature of the "Falling Star Sword".</p><p></p><p>At this moment, looking at this golden flying sword, Xu Bai was not angry. Instead, he carefully observed it.</p><p></p><p>"This sword is not inferior to the elders of the Heavenly Sword Sect. No wonder Chang Ge would admire it."</p><p></p><p>Feeling the sharp, determined aura emanating from it, intent on cleaving through everything, Xu Bai became deeply immersed.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, Nangong Shirong's voice, filled with both anger and apprehension, startled Xu Bai awake.</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Old thing, you're too much of a bully. If it weren't for the fact that I can't beat him..." </p><p>Xu Bai pretended not to hear the latter half of the sentence and cupped his hands, saying, "My lord, you have returned."</p><p>"No wonder Old Guan was in such a hurry. As soon as something happened to Guan Changge, he rushed over to demand an explanation. It turns out that this little Guan Changge is the son of his old lover." Nangong Shirong waved his hand, indicating that Xu Bai didn't need to be so polite. He then sat down with a hint of schadenfreude and said.</p><p>But Nangong Shirong's next words caught him a bit off guard: "No, they don't have any actual blood relationship. It's just an old-fashioned, unrequited love story. Old Guan may seem ruthless, but behind the scenes, he's a hopeless romantic. Even though his old lover has already married someone else, he still can't forget her. He even cares for and looks after her son."</p><p>"If I hadn't visited the Extreme Saint, I wouldn't have known about this." Nangong Shirong said with a half-smile.</p><p>Xu Bai just listened quietly, without any unusual expression on his face. The mutual teasing between the Immortal Saints was not something a small fry like him could participate in.</p><p>"The Extreme Saint, the supreme commander of the Weifu Institute of the Myriad Immortal Alliance. In his previous life, he was cursed and died prematurely in the great battle between the Five Elders. But in this life, he still lives well and wields the power of the Weifu Institute. Judging from Nangong Shirong's tone, he seems to have a close relationship with the Extreme Saint," Xu Bai thought to himself.</p><p>"When Old Guan Xingxiu gets worked up, even ordinary people can't stop him. Even if it's for the sake of the Extreme Saint, he may not give in. We'd better hurry up and send him away. How's the investigation into Guan Changge's disappearance going?" After muttering for a while, Nangong Shirong finally asked.</p><p>So Xu Bai detailed the incidents of cultivator disappearances that had occurred over the years in Tianliangzhou.</p><p>"The Boundless Wall?" Nangong Shirong seemed to remember something, and a flash of surprise appeared in his eyes.</p><p>"Apart from you, who else knows about this?" he quickly asked.</p><p>"I haven't made it public and have been waiting for your return, my lord," Xu Bai answered decisively.</p><p>Nangong Shirong was very satisfied: "Good. Treat the previous disappearance incidents as if they never happened. It was just an isolated case! We can't let others make unfounded speculations!"</p><p>"Next, you'll come with me to the Boundless Wall to see if we can rescue that little Guan Changge," Nangong Shirong ordered.</p><p>"I will obey, my lord!" </p><p>Without gathering too many people, Nangong Shirong only brought Xu Bai and three other core Nascent Soul cultivators with him to the foot of the Boundless Mountain.</p><p>At this moment, there was no image appearing on the smooth mountain surface.</p><p>They didn't get too close, but observed from a distance.</p><p>"I've been to this Boundless Wall before, when I was still a Nascent Soul cultivator. I had quite an experience back then."</p><p>As if lost in old memories, Nangong Shirong's gaze became unfocused, and after a long while, he slowly said.</p><p>The other three Nascent Soul cultivators remained silent, only Xu Bai asked with a slightly surprised tone, "Don't tell me, my lord, you've also seen strange phenomena on this Boundless Wall?"</p><p>Nangong Shirong chuckled, "Not seen, but I was once trapped inside the Boundless Wall."</p><p>"But I quickly broke out of it back then, so I just thought it was an illusion during my cultivation. Over the years, I've never heard of anyone else having the same experience, so I gradually forgot about it."</p>

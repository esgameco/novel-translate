        <h1>Chapter 559</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After the disappearance of the Tianling Flower, many previously strictly confidential methods slowly became circulated.</p><p></p><p>Named "Hua Jianji," it was a method of painting that completely sealed the Tianling Flower inside the painting.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the "Hua Jianji" was not specifically prepared for the Tianling Flower but was created to depict all the flowers in the world.</p><p></p><p>The author of Hua Jianji was named Zhao Chong, who had an extreme passion for flowers.</p><p></p><p>He vowed to see all the flowers in the world.</p><p></p><p>So, he planned to use brush and ink to record all the flowers in the world.</p><p></p><p>However, he was just an average painter with no exceptional talent.</p><p></p><p>His paintings were completely different from the real objects, almost sacrilegious to real flowers.</p><p></p><p>"Blasphemy against real flowers."</p><p></p><p>Racking his brains, he then came up with this method of directly sealing the physical object into a "painting."</p><p></p><p>Although it lost some artistic charm, it was vivid and incredibly realistic.</p><p></p><p>Yet, in Zhao Chong's previous life's Hua Jianji, there was no mention of the Tianling Flower. It is because he had already heard of the beauty of the Tianling Flower and believed that the more beautiful it was, the more it should be saved for the last.</p><p></p><p>He hesitated to start.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until after the Tianling Battle in Tianling Prefecture, when the beautiful scenery of Tianling was no more, that he regretted deeply, crying out his remorse to everyone he met.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan tucked the box containing the Tianling Flower into his arms and continued pretending to browse in the shop.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the unfriendly glances from the shopkeeper, he left reluctantly. </p><p></p><p>Leaving the shop, Li Fan went to the Dao Pavilion in the city and rented a house.</p><p></p><p>He bought three items from Tian Xuan Mirror: "Ice Drops Dew," "Ru Xiang She," and "Qian Se Juan."</p><p></p><p>Although none of them were expensive items, they almost depleted all the contribution points on Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>He took out the seventeen petals of the Tianling Flower and placed them on Qian Se Juan.</p><p></p><p>Then, he soaked them in Ice Drops Dew.</p><p></p><p>As the cold air rose from the petals, he pressed down Ru Xiang She.</p><p></p><p>Following the method described by Zhao Chong from his previous life, Li Fan operated carefully.</p><p></p><p>Qian Se Juan bloomed with thousands of colors.</p><p></p><p>The light penetrated through the Tianling Flower, reflecting on Ru Xiang She, seamlessly integrating the frozen Tianling Flower, Qian Se Juan, and Ru Xiang She together.</p><p></p><p>The light gradually dimmed, and soon, a thin, transparent "paper" appeared in Li Fan's hands.</p><p></p><p>Although it felt flat to the touch, what his eyes saw was exactly like the real blooming flowers.</p><p></p><p>The scenes on the seventeen flower petals were clearly visible.</p><p></p><p>They could even see the whole flower trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>"This will do."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Lastly, I need to apply a layer of spiritual protection on the surface to prevent malicious damage."</p><p></p><p>"But there's no rush."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the "painting" in his hand, knowing that it would soon become a unique existence in the entire Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Its value would be immeasurable by then.</p><p></p><p>Wealth was secondary; the main thing was its unique appeal.</p><p></p><p>Enough to accomplish some things that mere contribution points couldn't.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled faintly, then contentedly admired it for a moment before carefully putting it away.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the Dao Pavilion, Li Fan wandered aimlessly in Tianling City for three days.</p><p></p><p>On this day, a sudden exclamation came from Tianling City.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, look at the sky!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan raised his head at the sound and finally saw the scene he had been anticipating for a long time.</p><p></p><p>A rolling black swamp that covered the sky like dark clouds.</p><p></p><p>It seemed overwhelmingly powerful, but inside, it was already desolate and lifeless.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a phrase popped up in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Ingest the Hundred Abyss Immortal Realm to form the Yuan Infant, draw the Tianling Water to transform its spirit."</p><p></p><p>"Sacrifice the soul of the Black Swamp to unite with the Dao."</p><p></p><p>"In the land of Tianling Prefecture, he was severely wounded by the cultivator Xu Huating."</p><p></p><p>"Dying and vanishing, still Dao reincarnates!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"It's really him." Li Fan's eyes flashed with light.</p><p></p><p>With a cultivator falling, a big battle was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance would issue a war readiness announcement.</p><p></p><p>By then, the borders of various states would be closed off.</p><p></p><p>He had to hurry and leave this place of turmoil before that and return to the relatively calm Cloud Sea in Tianling Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>While other cultivators were still in shock, Li Fan had quietly entered the teleportation array.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan's figure completely disappeared, the sounds of astonishment and discussion erupted in Tianling City.</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Jiuyuan? When did he achieve Dao unity?"</p><p></p><p>"No! How did he die?!"</p><p></p><p>"Who is Xu Huating? How could he kill a Dao unified cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>"The most promising successor of the Dragon Family fell like this. This will be an interesting spectacle."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>From the shock to the recovery in Tianling Prefecture, people began to express their disbelief.</p><p></p><p>A huge storm was brewing with Tianling Prefecture as its center, sweeping towards the entire Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Sea.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao, who was closely monitoring the price fluctuations of the purchased items, was so nervous and sweating cold due to the slight changes in price.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he heard the clear and mechanical voice of the Tian Xuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Effective immediately, the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance is put on Grade B battle readiness."</p><p></p><p>"All cultivators are not allowed to cross state borders."</p><p></p><p>"All members of the Alliance's system are to return to the state capital as soon as possible and await further instructions."</p><p></p><p>"If any external cultivators are found, they are to be killed on the spot, regardless of the consequences."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The message was repeated three times before stopping.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was first stunned, then his eyes widened, shocked to the point of standing up.</p><p></p><p>Was the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance going to war with the Five Elders Council?</p><p></p><p>Fearing the imminent war, He Zhenghao was about to contact Gao Yuan to discuss countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>However, he suddenly thought of something, his expression changing dramatically. He quickly lowered his head and looked at the prices of the various goods on the Tian Xuan Small Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The reactions of speculators were always incredibly sharp.</p><p></p><p>As the vast majority of cultivators in the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance were still in shock over the impending war, the items Heaven Jade Pills, Standard Tian Gang Armor, Divine Martial Thunder, Hundred Battle Formation Map...</p><p></p><p>The prices of these items that Li Fan had instructed He Zhenghao to hoard had already started to rise significantly.</p><p></p><p>Not just these items on the list, but anything related to life preservation and combat in the Tian Xuan Mirror showed a widespread price increase.</p><p></p><p>Because they knew that with the current reserves of these items, they would not be able to withstand the chaos and demands of the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>With a great war approaching, who dared to guarantee that they would not enter the battlefield?</p><p></p><p>More protection and preparation meant more chances of survival.</p><p></p><p>Compared to life, what did those contribution points count for?</p><p></p><p>Even if the prices doubled, cultivators would readily pay.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, He Zhenghao understood the situation.</p><p></p><p>"The ability of adults is truly unpredictable!"</p><p></p><p>Watching the soaring prices of goods, He Zhenghao was both happy and fearful.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he was pleased that the value of the goods he stockpiled, worth one hundred million contribution points, had already risen by a third in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>However, he was afraid that his hoarding behavior might be punished by the Alliance.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

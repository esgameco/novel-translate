        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 1176: Intention to Travel Deep into Space</p><p></p><p>The stone puppets, after drifting away from the Xuanhuang Realm and heading deep into the starry sky, lost contact with Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>However, the shock caused by the facts they observed was far from over for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"How could it come from the depths of the Darkest Star Sea?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that there exists another Starving Immortal there?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart was filled with inexplicable horror.</p><p></p><p>The true body in the Yanfa Jue space even needed to actively operate the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra to suppress the astonishment and not reveal any abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>For Li Fan, such a thing had not happened for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The tremors in the Xuanhuang Realm continued.</p><p></p><p>However, as time passed, it could be clearly felt that the amplitude of the tremors was slowly decreasing.</p><p></p><p>This inexplicable disaster was passing.</p><p></p><p>But the thought storm in Li Fan's mind had just begun.</p><p></p><p>"The suction force of the Immortal Ruins was produced by the skeletal immortal's comprehension of the true immortal seal character named [Hunger]. Sitting and comprehending the Dao, the state of self-forgetfulness, had a devastating impact on this starry region."</p><p></p><p>"But the true immortal seal characters are not something only one person can comprehend. The anomaly in the Xuanhuang Realm's Source Dao State seems to be the Tiandu Great Master's comprehension of the profound mysteries of the Hunger Character Art."</p><p></p><p>"Now it seems that there are two possibilities for this Xuanhuang turbulence. One is that what triggered the disaster is not related to the [Hunger] Character Art, but merely the consequences caused by an existence of the same level. Only the power at the true immortal level can have such a violent impact on the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"But this means that an unknown existence possessing the power of a true immortal is still hidden in the Darkest Star Sea. This..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart felt slightly chilled.</p><p></p><p>"The second possibility is that one of the survivors in the star sea, or even the Dharma Transmitter, is also comprehending the Hunger Character Art. He recently had a breakthrough, thus causing this disturbance. The possibility of Dharma Transmitter Celestial being able to send back a message in advance is still very high."</p><p></p><p>"But no matter which guess it is, it cannot explain the most crucial point: why did such a change occur in this world?"</p><p></p><p>The light of the Dao Transformation Stone flickered, repeatedly playing the experiences of this world in a loop.</p><p></p><p>However, it was simply impossible to determine what exactly caused such a large deviation.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of whether it's a true immortal or an existence capable of comprehending the Hunger Character Art, my actions in this life should not be enough to influence them."</p><p></p><p>"But all of this happened nonetheless."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained silent.</p><p></p><p>This is the influence that one's every move inadvertently has on the outside world once their strength reaches a certain level, even changing the fates of others. Variables give rise to more variables, endlessly, ultimately leading to unexpected changes.</p><p></p><p>"The true body has always stayed in the Yanfa Jue space, so it can be ruled out. The avatar Li Ping only frolicked in the small world of Daqi, and even transporting the Five Elements Great Cave Heaven is absolutely insufficient to cause such a large variable. It must be the Holy Fetus' travels that went wrong."</p><p></p><p>After some pondering, Li Fan finally pinpointed the source of the variables on the mysterious figure at the bottom of the Chizha Abyss and the formless existence in the Wangsheng Maze.</p><p></p><p>"These two, one collecting world fragments and the other collecting the corpses of cultivators. Most of the time, they should be active in the Darkest Star Sea."</p><p></p><p>"Because of the Holy Fetus' disturbance, their activity trajectories changed compared to the previous reincarnations. That's what led to the occurrence of the Xuanhuang turbulence..."</p><p></p><p>"Just what else is there in the Darkest Star Sea?"</p><p></p><p>Previously, he thought that the Darkest Star Sea</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Among the worlds, only the Xuanhuang Realm still survived. Beyond the Xuanhuang Realm, there were only drifting remnants of worlds, a deathly stillness.</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed that secrets still lay hidden there, unknown to all.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed. I have always had a doubt - in what form do the remnants of the immortal worlds in the Darkest Starry Seas exist? Affected by the gravitational pull of the Immortal Ruins, even complete immortal worlds inevitably fall towards the Immortal Ruins. These remnants should be even less able to resist and should have long been devoured by the Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>"But judging from how the Xuanhuang Realm has been constantly patched up, and what Han Zhong saw in the Eye of the Heavenly Beast, there are still a large number of world fragments in the Darkest Starry Seas. In a way that I do not yet know..."</p><p></p><p>Sensing the intermittent tremors that still shook the Xuanhuang Realm, a flash of inspiration suddenly struck Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"That's right! Previously, because of the gravitational pull of the Immortal Ruins, I was unable to escape the Xuanhuang Realm and explore the Darkest Starry Seas. But now, because of this mysterious gravitational force from the depths of the Darkest Starry Seas, perhaps..."</p><p></p><p>"There's no time to lose. The tremors are about to disappear, and I don't have much time left."</p><p></p><p>In Broken Palm Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>During the tremors in the Xuanhuang Realm, even the Roaring Abyss was much more subdued, not making any noise at all.</p><p></p><p>The Qingxuan Army, who had suppressed the abyss for a hundred years and could hold their ground even in the face of the terrifying demonic sound waves, turned pale and trembled at the sight of the true horror of heaven and earth this time.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra taught by the Holy Fetus Li Fan earlier, perhaps quite a few of them would have had all their suppressed negative emotions erupt at once, instantly losing their minds and going completely insane.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the ordinary Qingxuan soldiers, even the leader of the Qingxuan Army, Shao Jun who had attained the Dao, knew in advance that the Xuanhuang tremors were coming, but still felt a little disoriented in the face of such a catastrophe of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"I never thought that the vast Xuanhuang Realm would be like a small boat on a river in a storm, in danger of capsizing at any moment," Shao Jun said in a bitter tone.</p><p></p><p>But the Holy Fetus Li Fan had no time to comfort him.</p><p></p><p>"Shao Jun, quickly help me with something."</p><p></p><p>"What?" Shao Jun was a little dazed for a moment, not reacting.</p><p></p><p>"Help me gather these items, the faster the better." After transmitting the list of supplies to Shao Jun with a finger, the Holy Fetus Li Fan's expression turned solemn as he raised his head to gaze at the sky of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Collecting these supplies is not a problem. Most of them are available in the eternal immortal strongholds. But Brother Li, what do you want these things for?" Shao Jun looked in the direction of the Holy Fetus Li Fan's gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Such a magnificent force, the entire world is as fragile as a toy before it. Shao Jun, aren't you curious?"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan's eyes were determined, even revealing a hint of madness.</p><p></p><p>"I want to fly out of the Xuanhuang Realm, trace it to its source, and investigate!" He declared resoundingly.</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely not! Outside the Xuanhuang Realm is..." Shao Jun's expression changed and he tried to dissuade him. Halfway through his words, he inexplicably stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Shao Jun, were you going to say the two words 'Immortal Ruins'?"</p><p></p><p>Shao Jun was completely shocked this time, looking at the Holy Fetus Li Fan with some disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan did not explain how he knew this top secret, but waved his hand and said solemnly, "It is precisely because the Immortal Ruins exist that now is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li, what exactly..." Shao Jun was shocked and doubtful.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Shao Jun thinks that the culprit behind this catastrophe is the Immortal Ruins?" Li Fan asked in return.</p>

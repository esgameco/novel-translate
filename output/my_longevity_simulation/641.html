        <h1>Chapter 641</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>But soon, the impact of incompatible cultivation methods became stronger, and the cultivators ultimately could not escape the fate of mutual annihilation. The immortal sect perished, and the immortal civilization entered a long period of darkness.</p><p></p><p>Everything has its opposite.</p><p></p><p>The number of cultivators drastically decreased to almost extinction. However, humans, like vigorous weeds, began to emerge from all over the world once again.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the origins of these newly born humans, some say they are the fish that escaped the net during the Great Migration Movement. Some say they are descendants of cultivators. Some say they are ordinary people from small worlds who broke through the seal of the Immortal Array and returned.</p><p></p><p>In any case, as cultivators gradually disappeared from the earth, the ordinary people of the Xuanhuang Realm began to grow gradually in the gaps.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying the appearance of ordinary people, there was also the Xuanhuang Clear Heart Spell.</p><p></p><p>Like folk songs and legends that seem to have emerged from nowhere, with each passing of the mouth, almost all human ethnic groups learned of this method that enabled ordinary people to break free from the influence of Immortal Filth and once again step onto the path of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Current cultivators speculated that this was likely the handiwork of the mysterious Eastern Supreme Lord of the Universal Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Because the Pure Spirit Pool that can also dispel the Immortal Filth was created by the Eastern Supreme Lord. It is very likely that the Xuanhuang Clear Heart Spell was an attempt by the Eastern Supreme Lord before creating the Pure Spirit Pool.</p><p></p><p>But now, Li Fan, who has known the true face of the Xuanhuang Clear Heart Spell, understands that this possibility is very low.</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Supreme Lord, the nominal leader of the Universal Immortal Alliance, only appeared a few times in the early history recorded by the Universal Immortal Alliance, and then completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Rather than being a true immortal, Li Fan believes he is more likely to have discovered the mystery of the Xuanhuang Clear Heart Spell, just like himself.</p><p></p><p>Inspired, he then created the Pure Spirit Pool.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the disappearance of the Eastern Supreme Lord is also related to the Xuanhuang Clear Heart Spell?" This thought involuntarily crossed Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>And when Li Fan wanted to search for information about the Eastern Supreme Lord, just like before, there was almost a blank, with no extra records.</p><p></p><p>This clearly does not match the identity of the leader of the Universal Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"It really makes one think deeply."</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Fan stopped delving deeper and instead carefully pondered the Xuanhuang Clear Heart Spell again.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later, Li Fan once again gathered a group of people at the Political Affairs Hall.</p><p></p><p>Originally, everyone thought Li Fan had some major news to announce, but unexpectedly, what came was the news that Li Fan was going into seclusion again.</p><p></p><p>"You just came out of seclusion not long ago? Going into seclusion again? Is it common for ancient cultivators to be so diligent in cultivating?"</p><p></p><p>"Master Envoy has no shortage of contributions, able to stay in the 'Awakening' state, cultivating is simply a pleasure. I wish I could have that too."</p><p></p><p>"Earlier there were rumors that the master has already recovered to the Yuan Infant realm. Could it be that he is about to break through to the Nascent Soul realm now?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Among the discussions of the crowd, only He Zhenghao seemed deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Master Envoy should be preparing for the descent of the soul of heaven and earth," he casually glanced at Zhou Qing'ang beside him.</p><p></p><p>When Master Envoy announced this, there was no change in his expression, indicating that he had already known about it.</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to the beginning, it was clear that he was the most trusted by Master Envoy. It was a pity that due to his greed at one point, this kid snatched away the trust.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, He Zhenghao couldn't help but feel uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an idea popped into his mind.</p><p></p><p>So he passed a sound transmission to Zhou Qing'ang: "How have you been cultivating recently, Zhou Daoist?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang looked surprised at He Zhenghao who came to strike up a conversation. After a moment of thought, he understood the intention and responded: "Hehe, what are you talking about? You also know that Master Envoy delegates all political affairs and trivial matters to us. Originally, with Gao Yuan helping, but not long ago, he also took a leave of absence, so it became even busier."</p><p></p><p>"Handling political affairs every day has already consumed most of my time; where can I find the time to cultivate peacefully?"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao pretended to be very agreeable, sighed, and echoed.</p><p></p><p>But soon, he changed the subject.</p><p></p><p>"I have a word, would you be willing to listen, friend?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang was momentarily surprised but quickly said, "Please speak, He Brother."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao said solemnly, "Friend wholeheartedly sharing the worries for Master Envoy is commendable."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao emphasized, "To forge iron, one must be strong! Even if you are favored by the master, your strength is only at the Golden Pill stage, and it's still the weakest stage of the Golden Pill. Now, in this small Cloud Sea, you can still control your subordinates. But as the master's cultivation continues to recover, his realm will be higher and higher. By then, his subordinates will surely gather at the Nascent Soul and Yuan Infant stages. If you don't advance, how can you be respected by them?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang's face changed slightly at the words.</p><p></p><p>At first, he seemed as if he wanted to retort, but soon he fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, He Zhenghao couldn't help but feel secretly pleased.</p><p></p><p>"Gao Yuan's words are really useful. If my heart were not resolute, I'm afraid I would have been convinced by him back then." He Zhenghao thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Zhou Qing'ang seemed to have figured it out and showed a bitter expression.</p><p></p><p>"What you said makes sense, friend. But I can't break free and focus on cultivating, it's hard," he said to He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's spirits lifted, "Zhou Daoist, why not follow Gao Yuan's example? Surely there must be a great opportunity inside the remnants of the Ancient Rising Sect. If you can obtain it, you will at least advance by a small realm. Even breaking through to the Yuan Infant realm is not impossible."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang hesitated to speak.</p><p></p><p>But He Zhenghao interjected, "I know what you're worried about, that you will delay the political affairs. Don't worry, I'm here! If there's an extra task, I won't mind taking it!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang looked doubtful, "In that case, He Daoist, why don't you go? When did you start thinking so much for your colleagues?"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's expression turned disgruntled, "That's easy to say. Initially, Master Envoy reminded me that unity comes first among us few. To help the two brothers upgrade their cultivation, I worked hard for a while. Plus, with Master Envoy's cultivation getting higher, there will surely be more people following him in the future. We are a natural alliance; helping them is helping myself."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao paused, observed Zhou Qing'ang's expression, and continued, "Furthermore, I have recently had some insights. I am close to breaking through to the Yuan Infant realm. Without waiting for an opportunity, I am confident of advancing within ten years!"</p><p></p><p>"Why not seize the opportunity?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1124</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Zhang Fu had long heard about the horrors of the Underworld Prison.</p><p></p><p>And during the recent round of cruel torture he experienced, he also deeply understood the terror of the punishments in this place.</p><p></p><p>After hearing Kou Hong's words and personally witnessing several monks being tortured to the point of madness and losing their human form, he was very clear that he definitely would not be able to endure the brutal torture here. So he readily agreed to Kou Hong's request. </p><p></p><p>"If it really becomes impossible, I can at most go back on my word and sell this person out," Zhang Fu thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>However, after following Kou Hong in reciting a vow, all of his little schemes turned to nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Merciful True Immortal?" Initially, Zhang Fu did not pay much attention to this so-called True Immortal. But later on, whenever thoughts of betrayal surfaced in his mind, an inexplicable sense of impending doom would always arise.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Zhang Fu finally confirm that he had truly boarded a pirate ship with no way back.</p><p></p><p>Next, Kou Hong and Zhang Fu slowly began their infiltration plan in the Underworld Prison.</p><p></p><p>For every newly imprisoned inmate, just as they were about to break down mentally after inhuman torture, Kou Hong would always make timely contact.</p><p></p><p>Under the illumination of the Merciful True Immortal's divine power, these prisoners, as if grasping at a final lifeline, joined the jailbreak organization without any hesitation. </p><p></p><p>As for those inmates who had been imprisoned for a long time yet still maintained their basic self-awareness, they became Kou Hong's primary targets for persuasion.</p><p></p><p>However, having been locked up for so long, some of these monks were suspicious and unwilling to easily trust anyone. Completing each persuasion required a great deal of time and effort.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the newly joined members also all participated.</p><p></p><p>So the progress of infiltrating the Underworld Prison was not too slow.</p><p></p><p>Three years later.</p><p></p><p>The wails resounding throughout the Underworld Prison concealed the private exchanges among the members of the jailbreak organization.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Kou, how much longer do we have to wait?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, apart from the deepest areas of the prison, the other regions have basically all been breached by our brothers. On the surface, this place still seems to be under the control of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. But in reality, as soon as you give the order, Brother Kou, the Underworld Prison will instantly change hands."</p><p></p><p>"Over these years, with the blessing of the Merciful True Immortal's divine power, we have all recovered our cultivation. Some brothers have even advanced further. One Harmonized Dao, sixteen Nascent Soul, over a hundred Core Formation... In comparison, the defensive forces in the Underworld Prison are simply no match."</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, it's not just cultivation recovery. By borrowing the Merciful True Immortal's divine power, we can even silently bring in all kinds of supplies from the outside world. The delicacies I had been thinking about for so long, I've almost gotten tired of eating them recently."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Everyone discussed animatedly, all filled with confidence about escaping from the Underworld Prison together.</p><p></p><p>Over these three years, having witnessed the divine powers displayed by the Merciful True Immortal so many times, they had long become devout believers of the True Immortal.</p><p></p><p>The discussion went on for a long time before Kou Hong finally spoke, "Starting a rebellion is easy, but what's more important is what happens after we get out. Once the Underworld Prison is breached, the Myriad Immortals Alliance will definitely react immediately and dispatch a great army to hunt us down."</p><p></p><p>"They won't give us much time to respond, so the future arrangements need to be planned out before we escape."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Kou Hong said this, everyone was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Future arrangements?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be the holy decree of the Merciful True Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Although they had joined the organization...</p><p></p><p>Three years had passed, but they only knew of the existence of the Compassionate Immortal.</p><p></p><p>They knew nothing about the true name of the organization or its real purpose.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, this is a test from the Compassionate Immortal. Only by completing the test can one truly become a believer of the Immortal and a member of the organization," Hong Kou said, his tone filled with a sense of sacred mission.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he transmitted a rather grand formation and a map to everyone.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Spirits Formation?" The moment they saw the name of this formation, the cultivators in the Underworld Prison were all slightly shocked.</p><p></p><p>According to the description, this formation had the ability to envelop heaven and earth and connect myriad realms.</p><p></p><p>Everyone then studied the map.</p><p></p><p>The map depicted the states within the territory of the Myriad Immortals Alliance, but it was marked with hundreds of small dots.</p><p></p><p>Focusing their spiritual sense on these small dots, everyone was startled to discover that they all represented small worlds.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Hong Kou also said, "The Immortal's test is actually not difficult. It just takes some time."</p><p></p><p>"Go to each small world and set up this Myriad Spirits Formation. Every time a formation is completed, they will automatically connect to form a formation network. So the moment the first one is completed, we will all know..."</p><p></p><p>Hong Kou explained earnestly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, seeing the doubts of some cultivators in the organization, he explained, "Don't worry. These selected small worlds are all worlds where only mortals exist. With your strength, it is absolutely enough to suppress them in a short time. The Compassionate Immortal has also bestowed the divine artifact 'Heavenly Furnace' to help you transform the small worlds..."</p><p></p><p>"It can be said that the biggest test this time is your perseverance and faith."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the specific requirements of the test task, the cultivators all fell into their own contemplation.</p><p></p><p>However, they had long been imperceptibly influenced by the power of the Compassionate Immortal, and considering that once they broke out of prison, they would inevitably face the pursuit of the Myriad Immortals Alliance. Hiding in mortal small worlds might not be a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, without hesitation, they quickly accepted and began to ponder the details of the plan.</p><p></p><p>Having allocated the ownership of their respective small worlds and discussed in detail how to face all kinds of sudden situations after escaping from the Underworld Prison, three months later, when the prison guards of the Immortal Alliance were escorting another fugitive here, ready to throw him into the tall pillar cage and suppress and torment him, he was horrified to see that in the Underworld Prison, thousands of pillars shattered one after another.</p><p></p><p>Countless vicious prisoners, with fierce looks in their eyes, all locked onto him.</p><p></p><p>Under the surging murderous aura, his soul scattered on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Those foggy prison guards and cultivators of the Immortal Alliance who reacted and rushed to try to suppress them were all instantly torn to pieces.</p><p></p><p>"Charge out, don't linger!"</p><p></p><p>Hong Kou shouted, and the crowd, like beasts out of their cages, rushed out of the Underworld Prison.</p><p></p><p>All the defensive formations were like virtual setups.</p><p></p><p>The prisoners who had seen the light of day again roared to vent their excitement. But they did not stop on the spot because of this, but after simply distinguishing the direction, they all rushed towards their target small worlds.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, a group of villains had scattered without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the special envoy of the Myriad Immortals Alliance was alarmed and led a team to investigate.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the protective formation without any traces of being forcibly destroyed, his face showed an angry expression.</p>

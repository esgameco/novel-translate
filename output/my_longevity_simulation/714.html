        <h1>Chapter 714</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>His somewhat turbid eyes were only staring at the handsome but slightly excessive cultivator in front of him, his mind pondering over the three words "Overturning Heaven Society."</p><p></p><p>This name, Wang Qiupo was certainly familiar with.</p><p></p><p>Before, he had received a secret order from the Council of Elders to secretly investigate information about this organization. Despite using a lot of resources, in the end, he found nothing. Not even a single person had heard of this name.</p><p></p><p>It made Wang Qiupo even suspect for a while that maybe the organization had mistakenly got the target's name wrong when transmitting information.</p><p></p><p>This matter eventually came to nothing.</p><p></p><p>Until today, this young cultivator who claimed to be a member of the Overturning Heaven Society suddenly appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"Not only aware of my spy identity, but also very clear about my physical condition..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that there must be a traitor in the organization."</p><p></p><p>As one of the most outstanding spies still remaining in the Council of Elders, Wang Qiupo thought so immediately.</p><p></p><p>After all, the news of his impending death had been transmitted not long ago. He wanted to take advantage of this to manipulate the situation in coordination with the organization.</p><p></p><p>Having stayed in the Immortal Alliance for nearly eight hundred years, the first half of his life was unremarkable.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until the second four hundred years, after the young cultivators he had befriended during his youth began to rise to prominence, that he ushered in the most glorious period of his spy career. </p><p></p><p>In these years, the young cultivators he recommended to join the alliance were countless!</p><p></p><p>Certainly, part of it was due to the favor owed by his old friends.</p><p></p><p>But more importantly...</p><p></p><p>It was because these people were truly rare young talents!</p><p></p><p>And this was precisely the reason why he appeared very eccentric to outsiders.</p><p></p><p>If they were not outstanding talents, he would never recommend them!</p><p></p><p>As the top spy, Wang Qiupo knew well that infiltrating the enemy's camp might bring short-term gains. But as a spy, there would come a day when one would be exposed. By then, the spies he had painstakingly cultivated over the years would all be wiped out. To rise to a high position in the Immortal Alliance required the test of time. These young spies certainly wouldn't last until that day. Even if there were some extraordinarily lucky ones who met with success and gained access to important information, it was still uncertain. Hence, this method of operation posed minimal threat to the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>What Wang Qiupo needed to do was to voluntarily expose his spy identity before he died. Only by doing so could he deal a heavy blow to the Immortal Alliance!</p><p></p><p>Imagine, once the news of Wang Qiupo being a spy for the Council of Elders came out, it would surely create a stir.</p><p></p><p>And during these years, the cultivators he recommended would definitely come under suspicion!</p><p></p><p>Even if they cleared their names through investigations...</p><p></p><p>Would the Immortal Alliance dare to continue employing these people? Who could guarantee that these individuals hadn't used some secret method to pass the tests?</p><p></p><p>Considering this, those cultivators who had limitless potential and could serve as a solid force in various parts of the Immortal Alliance, eventually, even if they could save their lives, they would be exiled to some insignificant positions for cold treatment.</p><p></p><p>As the virtuous left silently, the positions emptied would inevitably be filled by mediocrities.</p><p></p><p>This was the "Poisonous Nail" plan that Wang Qiupo had been plotting for eight hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a small nail, it could cripple a vital part of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>This was what Wang Qiupo believed he could achieve as someone only at the Golden Dan realm.</p><p></p><p>The Poisonous Nail plan, originally seamless, was about to enter its final stage.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, at this moment, there came an unforeseen variable.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, what do you mean by this? Just say it straightforwardly," Wang Qiupo probed without changing his expression.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai smiled and straightforwardly said, "You must be a spy planted by the Council of Elders, right?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Qiupo squinted his eyes and admitted openly, "Correct!"</p><p></p><p>This straightforward admission caught Xu Bai slightly off guard.</p><p></p><p>However, it didn't affect anything.</p><p></p><p>"Old sir, there's no need to be nervous. If you know about our Overturning Heaven Society, then you should know that we are actually on the same side."</p><p></p><p>"We would only hope that you make the Immortal Alliance more chaotic. Why would we expose you?" Xu Bai first placated with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Just as Wang Qiupo seemed contemplative, Xu Bai suddenly became serious and said, "Actually, I came here this time to make a trade with you."</p><p></p><p>"And it involves something very important. Afraid of the risk of ordinary spies leaking the information, so I came directly to you."</p><p></p><p>Wang Qiupo, seeing the solemnity in the other's words, couldn't help but become more serious.</p><p></p><p>However, as a wily old soul of eight hundred years, he certainly wouldn't easily believe Xu Bai's words.</p><p></p><p>He remained silent, waiting to see what Xu Bai was getting at.</p><p></p><p>However, the following words from Xu Bai directly almost made him crush the bamboo staff in his hand in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"Did you know that a new Eternal Revered is about to be born in the Immortal Alliance?" Xu Bai said so.</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?" Despite having a deep composure, hearing such a world-shaking message abruptly caused a visible change in Wang Qiupo's countenance.</p><p></p><p>"It looks like you aren't aware of this? That shouldn't be the case..." Xu Bai furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>Wang Qiupo took a deep breath, seemingly trying to ascertain the truth in Xu Bai's words.</p><p></p><p>"We have already found out the reasoning behind this Revered, which is quite bizarre."</p><p></p><p>"Previously, the Immortal Alliance only had one Law-Transcending Revered whom you Council of Elders have had exchanges with. Now the Immortal Alliance has an additional Revered..."</p><p></p><p>"You should prepare yourself early."</p><p></p><p>"This Revered has not officially 【stabilized】, and can still be involved in secular affairs. Just be wary of being caught off guard..."</p><p></p><p>Wang Qiupo's mind was instantly thrown into disarray.</p><p></p><p>Although he fancied himself a successful spy for the Council of Elders, when it came to the level of an Eternal Revered, he knew very little.</p><p></p><p>The terms like reversing logic, stabilizing, confused him a bit.</p><p></p><p>However, if what the Overturning Heaven Society cultivator said was true...</p><p></p><p>Then he had to report to the organization as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Wang Qiupo glanced at Xu Bai again.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like he had guessed Wang Qiupo's thoughts, as he handed over a jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"I said I came to trade. I can provide you with specific information about this Revered. But you need to pay for it."</p><p></p><p>"The importance of this information exceeds all previous trades. We haven't raised the price, which is already quite sincere. After all, we are counting on you to rival the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai showed a strange smile and then made a gesture of invitation.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 310</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As for fire, </p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked around, made some comparisons, and felt that it would be more practical to directly use the Scarlet Flame Method.</p><p></p><p>In this world, the Scarlet Flame had been strengthened by heaven and earth, greatly increasing its combat power. </p><p></p><p>It was no longer the same as before.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan used it as one of the Five Elements Methods for his Golden Core formation, which was completely feasible.</p><p></p><p>"This time, I will boldly attempt to form the Golden Core based on the Five Elements Method, plus two sets of opposing principles."</p><p></p><p>"There may be some minor flaws, but it's impossible to achieve perfection in one go."</p><p></p><p>"Back then, I spent a hundred lifetimes to successfully build a perfect foundation with Huan Zhen."</p><p></p><p>"To achieve a perfect Golden Core, it certainly won't be too easy either."</p><p></p><p>"Let me give it a try first."</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Li Fan spent a total of 180,000 contribution points to purchase the three Golden Core insights.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, three Golden Core fragments of various shapes, looking somewhat incomplete, appeared in Li Fan's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Just like refining the Wonders of Heaven and Earth, I'll swallow them into my belly using the Devouring Method, then strip away and comprehend the principles contained within."</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Li Fan swallowed these three Golden Core fragments in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>Activating the Devouring Method, the Golden Core fragments arrived at the dantian and were adsorbed near Huan Zhen. </p><p></p><p>Countless suction forces burst forth from it, like a black hole.</p><p></p><p>Specks of golden light floated up from the fragments and flew towards Huan Zhen. </p><p></p><p>Bit by bit, insights into the three laws of Metal, Fire, and Earth emerged in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>It was different from what he had seen and heard with his own eyes and ears, or what others had personally taught him.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was like a memory that he had since birth but had forgotten, and suddenly recalled in an instant, with a deeper impression.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed a great treasure, saving countless efforts. The contribution points are well spent."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the ones circulating outside are all ordinary insights. Even if one can easily form the Golden Core with them, the final achievement will be limited."</p><p></p><p>"If I didn't just want to complete the Five Elements Method, with my true reliance being the four methods of Ink Killing, Secret Tibetan, Deathly Sword, and Blue Flame, I definitely wouldn't ruin my future like this."</p><p></p><p>As time slowly passed, the three Golden Core fragments became smaller and smaller.</p><p></p><p>When they were completely absorbed by Li Fan, his Five Elements Method was successfully completed.</p><p></p><p>"Everything is ready, I can form the Golden Core now."</p><p></p><p>In order to reduce the difficulty of Golden Core formation, Li Fan also purchased Wonders of Heaven and Earth with Metal, Wood, Fire, and Earth attributes from the Tianxuan Mirror, to serve as the foundation for condensing the laws.</p><p></p><p>Quickly recalling the nine law insights in his mind one by one, Li Fan took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Activating the closed-door cultivation anti-disturbance function of the side courtyard, a flash of brilliance appeared in Li Fan's eyes as he officially began his Golden Core formation.</p><p></p><p>"First, the endless Secret Tibetan power within the body, the law of creation."</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A sound like a volcanic eruption faintly came from within his body. Li Fan fully activated the Zaohua Honglu Technique, mobilizing the endless and infinitely vigorous Secret Tibetan power within his body.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a hint of blush appeared on Li Fan's face.</p><p></p><p>However, it was because the original body had not cultivated the Zaohua Honglu Technique before and had a weak physique, so it was a bit unbearable to suddenly mobilize so much Secret Tibetan power.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan's heart was as still as water, without the slightest fear.</p><p></p><p>The feeling of the clone being devoured by the black particles resurfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>From Huan Zhen, a void-annihilating power that could erase everything suddenly appeared, instantly circulating throughout the body, offsetting the vigorous Secret Tibetan power.</p><p></p><p>Creation and void-annihilation, two opposing forces, mutually generating and restraining each other.</p><p></p><p>While colliding within Li Fan's body, they gradually intertwined together.</p><p></p><p>Like a spiral, after circulating around the body, it merged into Huan Zhen.</p><p></p><p>"These two laws have reached a balance, I can try the next step."</p><p></p><p>Without joy or sorrow in his heart, half of Huan Zhen suddenly transformed into the shape of Deathly Sword intent.</p><p></p><p>The Deathly Sword intent that appeared this time not only referred to the foundation-building Wonder of the twelfth life Zhang Haobo.</p><p></p><p>It also incorporated Li Fan's new insights from witnessing the Deathly Broken Sword in this life.</p><p></p><p>It had even more distorted and crazy meaning.</p><p></p><p>Black deathly aura surged from the Deathly Sword intent, constantly spreading around the dantian.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy gathered in the dantian instantly became chaotic.</p><p></p><p>And with the spread of the deathly aura, it showed signs of going out of control.</p><p></p><p>Whispers suddenly sounded in Li Fan's ears. Even with Li Fan's mental state tempered through many reincarnations, he couldn't help but feel restless at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the Blue Flame Spirit emerged from the sea of consciousness, transforming into a stream of blue flames like a brook, cleansing the whole body.</p><p></p><p>The agitation and distortion were instantly suppressed.</p><p></p><p>The Deathly Sword intent seemed to sense something, its body trembling slightly, as if very dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>But the Blue Flame stream had already arrived in the dantian, enveloping the Deathly Sword intent.</p><p></p><p>No matter how the black deathly aura rushed and impacted, it could not break through the Blue Flame's blockade.</p><p></p><p>Without the influence of the Deathly Sword intent, the distortion in Li Fan's eyes slowly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"The Deathly Sword is indeed extraordinary. Even though I only observed a thread of it in the direction of its original form, there were signs of losing control."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I have the absolutely rational Blue Flame to assist me, successfully turning danger into safety."</p><p></p><p>"Deathly and Blue Flame have also reached a balance."</p><p></p><p>"The four great powers as the foundation are ready, next is the Five Elements Method."</p><p></p><p>Swallowing the four-attribute Wonders of Heaven and Earth prepared in advance into his belly, Huan Zhen transformed into the shape of the Canhai Pearl again.</p><p></p><p>The powers of the five attributes of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth instantly gathered together in the dantian.</p><p></p><p>This was an extremely vast force, making Li Fan's dantian show signs of being blown apart.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's body also slowly started to swell a little.</p><p></p><p>His heart sank, allocating a thread of energy, ready to restore Huan Zhen at any time in case of failure.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan concentrated all his remaining mental power, trying his best to control the balance of forces within his body.</p><p></p><p>But the Five Elements forces complemented each other. After entering the dantian, not only did they show no signs of dissipating.</p><p></p><p>Instead, as time passed, they became even more vast as they merged with each other.</p><p></p><p>"It's still a bit forced."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan secretly sighed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I'm going to fail?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan thought so.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was the reckless rampage of this external force that aroused the dissatisfaction of the two pairs of forces from before.</p><p></p><p>That spiral of creation and void-annihilation, the rational and distorted sword flames, jointly launched an attack on the Five Elements force.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a huge explosion occurred in the dantian.</p><p></p><p>"Puff!"</p><p></p><p>The violent impact made Li Fan spit out a mouthful of blood.</p><p></p><p>But there was joy instead of shock on his face.</p><p></p><p>Because Li Fan noticed that a huge vortex appeared in the glowing cloud mass of Huan Zhen's main body amidst the aftershocks of the explosion.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements force, spiral, and sword flames were all sucked into the vortex.</p><p></p><p>They mixed in the vortex, yet remained distinct.</p>

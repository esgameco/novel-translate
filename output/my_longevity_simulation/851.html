            <p>"Let's go. New 69 Book Bar 69shux.com"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli patted Wei Qizheng's shoulder, his eyes showing an encouraging look.</p><p></p><p>Coming out of the secret room, everyone saw Wei Qizheng, who seemed to have completely changed into another person, and couldn't help but marvel inwardly.</p><p></p><p>No one knew what secret technique Ji Shaoli had used on him, but the original trepidation and nervousness had all disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he was full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli and Wei Qizheng did not explain.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, the City Lord is still waiting, so I'll take my leave first." Wei Qizheng saluted.</p><p></p><p>"Then let me congratulate Brother Wei in advance on his success!"</p><p></p><p>"Little Brother Wei, if you become rich and noble, don't forget us!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone's attitude towards Wei Qizheng had completely changed, and they hurriedly returned the salute with enthusiasm.</p><p></p><p>Wei Qizheng nodded slightly and left Haixuan Island through the teleportation array.</p><p></p><p>Watching his gradually disappearing figure, He Zhenghao sighed with a hint of pride: "I had long seen that Little Brother Wei was no ordinary person and would definitely have a day of success. But I didn't expect it to come so quickly! It's not in vain that I took extra care of him before."</p><p></p><p>"It's really enough to make one die of envy. We started preparing for the exam a year early, but it's not even comparable to his last-minute cramming! Sigh..."</p><p></p><p>"Hiss. If Brother Wei is really selected as one of the Thirty-Three Immortal Candidates and directly promoted to a Harmonious Immortal in the future, wouldn't that mean I can also call an Harmonious Immortal Master my brother? He won't turn his face and not acknowledge it then, right?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Everyone's reactions varied.</p><p></p><p>But most of them could hardly conceal their envy and jealousy.</p><p></p><p>Only Ji Shaoli's eyes flickered. New 69 Book Bar → 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Immortal Alliance attached great importance to the Thirty-Three Immortal Candidate selection plan, which was held with such fanfare.</p><p></p><p>To be on the safe side, he did not act clever and lay down any traceless killing intent on Wei Qizheng.</p><p></p><p>Even the piece of [Final Separation Disc] that was separated only existed as an individual entity. It had no connection with the main body in his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>It just silently recorded everything it sensed around it, and only when it was completely destroyed would it transmit the collected information.</p><p></p><p>Such caution was to avoid any clues being found on Wei Qizheng.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Ji Shaoli had a vague premonition in his heart.</p><p></p><p>There was a high possibility that Wei Qizheng would successfully be selected as one of the Thirty-Three Immortal Candidates after this trip. But similarly, if he wanted to see him again, it would probably be a long time in the future.</p><p></p><p>Not many cultivators in Congyun Sea knew that Wei Qizheng had been summoned to the Immortal Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>He left quietly.</p><p></p><p>On the third day after he left, which was the tenth day after the end of the exam, the results were announced.</p><p></p><p>Some families were happy while others were sad.</p><p></p><p>On Haixuan Island, however, there was a scene of joyous laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, now those who didn't join our mutual aid society before must be regretting it!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the jubilation, He Zhenghao suddenly frowned and said with concern, "What if those jealous people report us?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out, the room instantly fell silent. New 69 Book Bar → 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't... right?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone's eyes flashed with a hint of worry.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, what are you all afraid of? As the saying goes, an upright person is not afraid of a crooked shadow!" At this time, Ji Shaoli said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"We just bet on the right questions! In the entire Myriad Immortal Alliance, there are countless organizations that study the exam and specialize in betting on questions. What's the difference if we're one more?" Ji Shaoli said righteously.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao and the others were slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>But then they heard Ji Shaoli snort coldly, "Besides, what can they report us for? Leaking exam questions is a capital crime. Without solid evidence, who dares to speak nonsense?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If there really are those who are blind..."</p><p></p><p>"Who knows who will die first!"</p><p></p><p>These words were said with unparalleled toughness.</p><p></p><p>It made everyone ponder and slowly their worries dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's not talk about these ominous things. Since you have passed the great examination, what are your thoughts on where you want to be assigned in the future?"</p><p></p><p>When registering for the great examination, there would be a preliminary preference for region and position.</p><p></p><p>But the specific position to be held still needed to be allocated and decided by the Immortal Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>It was determined by many factors such as the cultivator's place of origin, realm, potential, etc.</p><p></p><p>In principle, most were arranged locally, with elites being transferred to the Immortal Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>But occasionally, special circumstances would arise.</p><p></p><p>Just like He Zhenghao before, even though he could have gotten an official position in Tianyu Province.</p><p></p><p>But he was inexplicably assigned to this remote place in Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>It was because of the suppression from the Heng family behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>Most cultivators could only accept the assignment of their posts.</p><p></p><p>But for those with background and connections, they could maximize their own interests.</p><p></p><p>However, hearing Ji Shaoli's words, it seemed that there was still room for maneuvering.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, everyone was a bit tempted.</p><p></p><p>They each quietly transmitted a message to Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>Only He Zhenghao hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist He, what do you say?" Ji Shaoli asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a while, He Zhenghao finally replied, "If possible, I want to go to Tianyun Province. Tianquan Province is also fine."</p><p></p><p>Neither were Tianyu Province, but both were very close.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli instantly understood He Zhenghao's intention.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, he looked at everyone, "This great examination is special. I dare not guarantee the final result, I can only do my best."</p><p></p><p>"Whether it succeeds or not depends on your own fate!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone understood very well and thanked Ji Shaoli again.</p><p></p><p>"Before the final allocation results come out, you should still use this time to focus on cultivation. If your realm can advance another stage, then it will be different."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao and the others all nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>With hope, their subsequent cultivation became more serious than ever before.</p><p></p><p>As for Ji Shaoli, he began to launch a financial offensive, trying to insert as many pegs as possible into the Immortal Alliance's inland.</p><p></p><p>The destruction of Congyun Sea was destined, and staying here had no future.</p><p></p><p>The matter of his avatar trying to connect through Jing Xuan, Shen Yuzi, Huangfu Song and others to smooth things over will be omitted for now.</p><p></p><p>As the great examination came to an end, the attention of the Immortal Alliance cultivators all focused on the biggest winners of this examination - those cultivators who passed the preliminary screening and went to the Immortal Alliance headquarters to participate in the final selection of the Thirty-Three Immortals.</p><p></p><p>After all, achieving the position of a Converged Dao Immortal Venerable...</p><p></p><p>This level of influence was not comparable to ordinary Immortal Alliance positions.</p><p></p><p>Those who were interested and well-informed quickly compiled a list of these more than 300 lucky ones.</p><p></p><p>Detailed information about them also appeared before everyone's eyes.</p><p></p><p>After some research, it was found that there was nothing in common.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation levels of the more than 300 selected cultivators varied. From Foundation Establishment to Nascent Soul, all realms were included.</p><p></p><p>From lonely cultivators without any background, to core disciples of illustrious families, all were included.</p><p></p><p>The selection criteria of the Immortal Alliance really made people a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan also held this list in his hand and began to study it.</p><p></p><p>"Um, no Shuo Feng."</p><p></p><p>"Also none of the names of those true high-level Immortal Alliance descendants seen in the previous lives."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p>

            <p>Ximen Yue hurriedly lowered his head to apologize.</p><p></p><p>However, Supreme Immortal Cheng waved his hand, not minding it. "The Heavenly Feather Pill can extend life by 800 years. The Longevity Fruit can extend life by 500 years. The Rebirth Longevity Fruit can extend life by 300 years."</p><p></p><p>"They are all extremely rare treasures. Among the countless treasures I have seen in my past 3,612 years, the value of these few can definitely be ranked at the top."</p><p></p><p>"But now, they have all been cheaply obtained by me, a dying man."</p><p></p><p>Supreme Immortal Cheng said with a hint of self-mockery.</p><p></p><p>"Together, they can increase the lifespan of an ordinary cultivator by 1,600 years."</p><p></p><p>"But when used on me..."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, guess how much effect they will have?"</p><p></p><p>Supreme Immortal Cheng asked.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Han Yi saw that Supreme Immortal Cheng seemed to be quite approachable and became a little bolder.</p><p></p><p>He was the first to answer, "500 years?"</p><p></p><p>Supreme Immortal Cheng let out a light laugh and shook his head repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"200 years?" Ximen Yue guessed.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Immortal Cheng still shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"20 years?" Li Fan suddenly spoke up at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The guessed number was a bit outrageous, causing both Han Yi and Ximen Yue to look at him.</p><p></p><p>"Although you are already very bold, you still overestimated!" Supreme Immortal Cheng laughed and raised his right hand, holding up one finger.</p><p></p><p>"Ten years."</p><p></p><p>"This is the final deadline I can strive for."</p><p></p><p>"This is the result even after including the life-extending treasures offered by other cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Supreme Immortal Cheng said with a heavy voice and a smile.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan and the others all showed expressions of shock and horror.</p><p></p><p>"How can this be?" Ximen Yue was full of disbelief. "Could it be that the appraisal effect of the Heavenly Profound Mirror can also be false?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Han Yi also had very solemn expressions as they looked at Supreme Immortal Cheng, trying to get an answer from him.</p><p></p><p>However, Supreme Immortal Cheng did not answer immediately. Instead, he pointed to the large tree in front of him and asked the three, "Do you know what tree this is?"</p><p></p><p>Han Yi and Ximen Yue looked at it for a while but both shook their heads, unable to recognize it.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan said without hesitation, "Azure Cloud Willow, an ordinary spiritual wood. Aside from being ornamental, it has no other value."</p><p></p><p>After all, he had read the "Heavenly Physician Immortal Scripture" for so long, and it wasn't for nothing.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Immortal Cheng sized up Li Fan with his turbid eyes, seeming a bit surprised that he could recognize it.</p><p></p><p>He then asked, "Then do you know how many years an Azure Cloud Willow can live at most?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought for a moment and said, "An Azure Cloud Willow tree can live for 800 years, which is already extremely rare in the world. Exceeding a thousand years is nearly impossible."</p><p></p><p>Supreme Immortal Cheng slowly nodded. "What you said is correct."</p><p></p><p>"This Azure Cloud Willow was planted when I broke through to the Harmonious Dao realm and was designated as the successor to the Commander-in-Chief of the Guardian Court."</p><p></p><p>"That was already more than 900 years ago."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, I was in high spirits and full of ambition."</p><p></p><p>"I thought death was still far away from me. I believed I could take another step forward and had hopes for immortality."</p><p></p><p>Supreme Immortal Cheng shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I really didn't know the immensity of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>The Immortal sighed and returned to the main topic.</p><p></p><p>"For more than a hundred years, I watched helplessly as my old partner who had walked with me all the way was about to die of old age."</p><p></p><p>"I tried every possible way to save his life."</p><p></p><p>"Azure Wood Spirit Liquid, Immortal Soil Jade Nectar..."</p><p></p><p>"I tried all kinds of treasures."</p><p></p><p>"But it only barely pulled him back from the brink of death."</p><p></p><p>"Barely clinging to life..."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, I knew that death is inevitable for us."</p><p></p><p>Supreme Immortal Cheng looked up at the withered Azure Cloud Willow again.</p><p></p><p>"I just didn't expect that the same fate would befall me so quickly."</p><p></p><p>After Supreme Immortal Cheng finished speaking, he fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Supreme Immortal Cheng slowly said, "When the end is near, apart from taking another step forward and completing one's own overall transformation, all other methods can only slightly delay the arrival of death."</p><p></p><p>"Not only is the effect greatly reduced, but the more one struggles, the faster other similar methods lose their effectiveness."</p><p></p><p>"Just like these life-extending treasures you submitted. I have already consumed too many similar ones before. That's why a situation like 1,600 years turning into ten years occurs."</p><p></p><p>"If the will of heaven wants you to die at the third watch, it's truly difficult to keep you until the fifth watch."</p><p></p><p>Supreme Immortal Cheng looked up at the sky, and a trace of an indescribable expression flashed in his turbid eyes.</p><p></p><p>"However, ten years. For me, it's enough."</p><p></p><p>The old man's voice gradually lowered, and Li Fan and the others could no longer hear clearly.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask, Immortal, does this mean that these life-extending treasures are actually not as precious as imagined?" After a long time, Han Yi couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Immortal Cheng glanced at the three and laughed in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"The younger you are, the more precious they are."</p><p></p><p>"The older you are, the more useless they become."</p><p></p><p>"Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the three all had a pensive expression.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, meeting you vibrant young people today, I rarely talked so much."</p><p></p><p>"Now it's time to give you your rewards."</p><p></p><p>Without seeing Supreme Immortal Cheng make any movements, three jade tablets emitting a seven-colored glittering light suddenly appeared and flew towards Li Fan and the others.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took the jade tablet and saw that it was carved with profound patterns surrounding the character "Law" in the center.</p><p></p><p>"This is the [Audience Law Jade Tablet]. With this token, you can go to the Guardian Law Hall at the Myriad Immortal Alliance headquarters and apply to use the Derivation Law Orb." Supreme Immortal Cheng introduced to the three.</p><p></p><p>As if remembering something, Supreme Immortal Cheng reminded, "Remember, an [Audience Law Jade Tablet] only has one application opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"After submitting the application, you may have to wait a long time before it's your turn. Moreover, each derivation has a time limit."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be greedy and miss the opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, back in the day..."</p><p></p><p>Supreme Immortal Cheng's voice grew smaller and smaller, eventually becoming inaudible.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the blue-robed cultivator who had led them in earlier quietly reappeared beside them.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>He transmitted his voice.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and the others put away the [Audience Law Jade Tablets] and slowly retreated from this courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, let me give you a piece of advice. Your jade tablet can only be used to apply for the derivation of techniques at the Nascent Soul level. If you only use it to derive the main cultivation technique, it would be a bit too wasteful."</p><p></p><p>"You can try to let the Derivation Law Orb derive techniques with special effects."</p><p></p><p>"Although only at the Nascent Soul level, they may still have extraordinary effects."</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan stepped out of the courtyard, Supreme Immortal Cheng's voice suddenly rang in his ears.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but look back, only to see Supreme Immortal Cheng stroking the withered Azure Cloud Willow, just as he had seen when he arrived.</p><p></p><p>His back view was lonely.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan saw an old man walking towards the end of his life.</p><p></p><p>Slowly bowing to him, Li Fan quietly left.</p>

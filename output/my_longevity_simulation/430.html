        <div class="content">
            <p>But between him and Li Fan, it seemed like a gulf had suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>The distance was close yet far away, allowing Li Chenfeng to be full of anger without being able to fly over it, no matter how fast the wings behind him flapped.</p><p></p><p>He could never escape this invisible cage.</p><p></p><p>Yin and Yang Micro-dust Formation!</p><p></p><p>Although the one set up by Li Fan was just a simplified version, it was more than enough to trap Li Chenfeng, who relied solely on his powerful physical body combined with the beast.</p><p></p><p>"The Binding Insect actually failed." Li Fan looked at the fierce-faced Li Chenfeng with a very interested expression.</p><p></p><p>Taking a step forward, Li Fan's figure instantly appeared in the formation, behind Li Chenfeng.</p><p></p><p>Before he could react, Li Fan activated the Grand Five Elements Annihilation Sword in his hand, cutting off a large piece of horn-like armor from Li Chenfeng's body.</p><p></p><p>Li Chenfeng let out a painful and angry cry and was about to counterattack, but Li Fan had already left the Yin and Yang Micro-dust Formation, causing his attack to miss.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring Li Chenfeng's disgruntled roar, Li Fan placed the cut horn-like armor in front of him, carefully observing it.</p><p></p><p>Warm to the touch with the heat of a living being, but the texture was quite hard.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan controlled the spiritual power within him, condensing a water blade and shooting it towards the armor.</p><p></p><p>"Ding!"</p><p></p><p>After a crisp sound, the water blade was directly deflected.</p><p></p><p>The armor only left a faint scar and quickly disappeared with the flesh and blood's movement along the armor's edge.</p><p></p><p>"An attack equivalent to a mid-stage Golden Core cultivator can't even break through it. Quite surprising." Li Fan was somewhat astonished.</p><p></p><p>"Its vitality is strong, and it seems to have its own consciousness. Given enough nutrition and time, it may even grow into another complete body."</p><p></p><p>Having never seen anything like it before, Li Fan's gaze towards Li Chenfeng and the others was completely different this time.</p><p></p><p>"Being able to command a hundred thousand Rift Border Whales' small world is indeed not that simple."</p><p></p><p>"Now, let me see the extent to which your empire has developed."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's divine sense suddenly enveloped Li Chenfeng and the other three.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Water Illusion Technique, activate!</p><p></p><p>Li Chenfeng, who was still struggling, instantly quieted down.</p><p></p><p>The outer layer of the strange beast's horn slowly disappeared, returning to its original harmless handsome young man appearance.</p><p></p><p>With his eyes closed, Li Chenfeng's expression continued to change.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the Foundation Building Master and the man surnamed Xiao were already immersed in a beautiful dream, unable to extricate themselves.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Li Chenfeng finally let go of his guard and revealed a satisfied smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slowly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What is this..."</p><p></p><p>A hint of confusion flashed in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The small world where Li Chenfeng was located was a peculiar world with only endless oceans.</p><p></p><p>There were no islands in the ocean.</p><p></p><p>There was only a huge Sky-Supporting Turtle, with humans living on its back, constantly moving in the ocean.</p><p></p><p>In the sky floated the massive corpse of a Three-Headed Divine Bird, nearly occupying a third of the sky.</p><p></p><p>The Three-Headed Divine Bird had been dead for who knows how many years, yet its body had not decayed.</p><p></p><p>Originally, various unique beasts had gathered on it to feed on the corpse of the Divine Bird.</p><p></p><p>Many years ago, an extraordinary genius emerged from the population on the Sky-Supporting Turtle.</p><p></p><p>He mastered the ability to control strange beasts and selflessly imparted it to other human populations.</p><p></p><p>Under his leadership, humans successfully defeated the beasts that had occupied the Three-Headed Divine Bird's corpse.</p><p></p><p>Thus, a unified human empire was established on the corpse of the Divine Bird.</p><p></p><p>After thousands of years of development, the empire had nearly reached the pinnacle of exploiting and utilizing strange beasts.</p><p></p><p>Strange beasts had permeated every aspect of human life in the empire.</p><p></p><p>People could easily ride newly bred strange beasts like the Broad-Back Pheasant to travel to different parts of the world.</p><p></p><p>They could also tame strange beasts to hunt in the oceans, skies, and even creatures beyond the small worlds and voids.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the empire had developed techniques to integrate the power of strange beasts with humans, like the Beast God Armor Li Chenfeng was wearing.</p><p></p><p>However, despite the many achievements, a shadow always loomed over the empire.</p><p></p><p>Because the Three-Headed Divine Bird, which they revered as a deity, did not die naturally.</p><p></p><p>Also, it did not only have three heads during its lifetime.</p><p></p><p>In reality, the so-called Three-Headed Divine Bird should have been the Nine-Headed Bird.</p><p></p><p>This terrifying existence, which the empire could not imagine, had actually had six of its heads chopped off while it was alive.</p><p></p><p>And then it was thrown here.</p><p></p><p>The people of the empire were not unaware of the real culprit.</p><p></p><p>They knew it was a being called Immortal.</p><p></p><p>In the group, the legend of the ancestors being exiled here by the Immortals still circulated.</p><p></p><p>For the people of the empire, Immortals inspired both fear and longing.</p><p></p><p>The empire, although developed, could never resolve the issue of human lifespan.</p><p></p><p>Living a hundred years was already considered very long in the empire.</p><p></p><p>So the rumors of Immortal methods that could possess immense power and prolong life were greatly coveted by the empire.</p><p></p><p>After many attempts and sacrifices, the pioneers of the empire finally broke through the blockade of the Immortal Formation and arrived in this world.</p><p></p><p>However, the information they gathered there left them greatly disappointed.</p><p></p><p>To cultivate the Immortal methods, one needed spiritual energy, which did not exist in the world where the empire was located.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there were restrictions on the co-cultivation of various methods.</p><p></p><p>For the people of the empire, gathering even just one method of cultivating Immortality was extremely difficult, making the path to immortality seem unattainable.</p><p></p><p>But the resilient people of the empire did not give up.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they continually sent people to infiltrate the world and gather more information.</p><p></p><p>They also formed advisory groups to study possible ways to achieve Immortality.</p><p></p><p>Thus, after generations of effort, an almost incredible plan was proposed.</p><p></p><p>The first issue to solve was the problem of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>The solution to the problem was nothing short of a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>At the severed parts of the six heads, there were faint traces of the sword that had slain the Divine Bird initially.</p><p></p><p>The power of this unexplainable sword endured for countless millennia, suppressing the vengeful spirits of the Nine-Headed Bird.</p><p></p><p>All strange beasts would instinctively avoid the sword's qi.</p><p></p><p>One time, a citizen of the empire violated the law by visiting the sword's mark and secretly bringing his domesticated strange beast along.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he triggered the sword's qi.</p><p></p><p>The citizen was unharmed, but the strange beast was instantly killed by the sword's qi.</p><p></p><p>When the empire's guards arrested the citizen, they unexpectedly found a bright crystal nucleus left by the strange beast that should have been annihilated by the sword's qi.</p><p></p><p>Before they contacted the world beyond, the people of the empire could not clearly understand what this crystal nucleus was.</p><p></p><p>But the former Taoists were shocked to discover that the energy within this nucleus could serve as a substitute for spiritual energy for their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After further research by the empire, it was found that only a very few types of strange beasts had nuclei inside them.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, one of them was a group called the Flying Ball Beast, which reproduced rapidly and was easy to tame.</p><p></p><p>After the first large-scale breeding, the empire harvested tens of thousands of nuclei.</p><p></p><p>Among them, they also discovered mutated versions of the essence.</p><p></p><p>With the help of these nuclei, a thief at the initial stage of Refining Qi successfully broke through to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, due to the restrictions of Immortality cultivation, he could not progress further.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, this discovery brought the empire a glimmer of hope for Immortality cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The next challenge was to find the necessary means for cultivating like the methods of the Immortal Monarchs and overcome the restrictions of co-cultivation in Immortality methods.</p>

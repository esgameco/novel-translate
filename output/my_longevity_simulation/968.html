        <h1>Chapter 968</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"I will temporarily borrow this body and hide it away for now. When I need to contact you in the future, I will still do so through this method." Moru Bin said finally.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the two had made detailed arrangements about various matters that needed attention in their upcoming cooperation, but Li Fan did not ask Moru Bin to inquire about the secrets of the Immortal Alliance. It is said that if you want to take something, you must first give it. In Li Fan's view, Moru Bin's connection was still in the development stage and far from ready to be harvested.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps after helping him further advance his position among the preachers of the Myriad Immortal Alliance this time, I can make a small request." </p><p></p><p>He thought to himself after Moru Bin's divine sense completely disappeared from his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>In the next ten days, all cultivators practicing the "Divine Possession" technique, under Li Fan's suggestion, began to gather towards Luoyan State.</p><p></p><p>According to Moru Bin's plan, he would soon visit Luoyan State in the identity of a preacher.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Immortal Alliance's organizations and officials at all levels in Luoyan State would inevitably treat this matter with the highest standards.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Moru Bin would specifically attract the attention of all the supervisory forces, creating a breeding ground for Li Fan to freely spread the Divine Possession technique in Luoyan State.</p><p></p><p>For a month, Li Fan wanted to bewitch as many cultivators as possible during this period.</p><p></p><p>Then these cultivators would be dispersed to various parts of the Immortal Alliance, waiting for Moru Bin to complete his inspection tour and return to the Alliance headquarters soon after.</p><p></p><p>Then they would all erupt at once.</p><p></p><p>Once the situation became uncontrollable, Moru Bin would take the initiative to volunteer and take on the task of thoroughly exterminating these rebels.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan as an inside collaborator, it would surely be easy to perfectly resolve this matter.</p><p></p><p>This was roughly the plan.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in actual implementation, it was very likely to encounter all kinds of unexpected changes. Moru Bin had already made various preparations.</p><p></p><p>It really felt like he had everything under control and could win a battle a thousand miles away.</p><p></p><p>Of course, compared to Li Fan, he was still slightly inferior.</p><p></p><p>Soon, more than 30,000 Divine Possession cultivators, under Li Fan's suggestion, went to Luoyan State respectively. </p><p></p><p>In order not to arouse the vigilance of the relevant parties of the Myriad Immortal Alliance due to the sudden increase in the flow of people, under Li Fan's manipulation, some of these people went through transmission arrays, while others flew by air.</p><p></p><p>In batches, they arrived in various parts of Luoyan State within ten days and hid there.</p><p></p><p>And began to observe the surrounding cultivators and look for suitable candidates.</p><p></p><p>Although Luoyan State was not as prosperous as the four central states of the Immortal Alliance, it was still a first-class major state.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Immortal Venerable who was the commander-in-chief of the Myriad Immortal Alliance's Garrison Institute was from Luoyan State.</p><p></p><p>After he took power, he gave a lot of support to his hometown.</p><p></p><p>Many family members from Luoyan State were able to go to the headquarters of the Immortal Alliance to take up posts, and after years, they gave back to their hometowns.</p><p></p><p>After years of deep cultivation, the network of relationships could be said to be deeply entrenched and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>Only existences at the level of preachers could make Luoyan State treat them with such solemnity.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's sea of consciousness, the map of Luoyan State slowly unfolded.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the information sent back by his subordinates, Li Fan couldn't help but nod secretly: "The land is spiritual and the people are outstanding. Even excluding those descendants of big families, the overall quality of the cultivators is much better than that of the remote Congyu Sea."</p><p></p><p>"Well..."</p><p></p><p>"Everything is in place, just waiting for Moru Bin to..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Alright." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan first arranged for his subordinates to make contact with good targets and establish good relationships.</p><p></p><p>He was not in a hurry to make a move, but instead gradually gained the trust of the targets first.</p><p></p><p>The conversation scenes of 30,000 people were all stored in Li Fan's sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sat in the center, relying on his powerful divine sense and extremely high emotional intelligence, he was always able to give the best answer.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these more than 30,000 Shenlin body cultivators did not all act alone.</p><p></p><p>For those with lower abilities, Li Fan intentionally arranged them together. With each person contributing a few words, the efficiency of bewitching was even higher than those cultivators who fought alone.</p><p></p><p>Soon, in just a few days, there were tens of thousands of "close friends" in Luoyan State.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the tens of thousands of different scenes floating in front of his eyes, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>For him, making acquaintances, chatting, and gaining trust were nothing more than multiple-choice questions.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's current experience and mindset, it was not difficult to find the optimal solution among countless choices.</p><p></p><p>And often, choices made without emotion and with absolute rationality could better promote the relationship between the two parties.</p><p></p><p>"When you first make friends, the relationship is the most passionate. We need to strike while the iron is hot..." he thought silently.</p><p></p><p>Only one day later than the agreed time, on this day, there seemed to be an unusual atmosphere enveloping the sky of Luoyan State.</p><p></p><p>In the 30,000 scenes, countless discussions flew into Li Fan's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? How come I haven't seen Young Master Cai recently? Could it be that he has found some new tricks again?"</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, it's strange that I haven't met Brother Zhang for several days either."</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, I went to Luoyan Heavenly City today to take care of some business, but I was actually stopped. They didn't give any reason, just wouldn't let me in! I spit!"</p><p></p><p>"Those guys from the Martial Arts Hall have been more diligent recently. But from what I see, it seems a bit like they're just going through the motions."</p><p></p><p>"Hiss..."</p><p></p><p>The various unusual performances combined, the cultivators of Luoyan State quickly realized.</p><p></p><p>Some big shots have come to Luoyan State.</p><p></p><p>However, smart people have already decided to only go into seclusion in the Tianxuan Mirror recently and not go out.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, for some reason, they might disappear without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Inside Luoyan State, all was calm.</p><p></p><p>The many cultivators also had a clear understanding and did not dare to make any moves.</p><p></p><p>They just gathered with good friends and discussed privately.</p><p></p><p>And at this time, it was finally Li Fan's turn to show his power.</p><p></p><p>How to stir up the emotions of the target cultivators and arouse their resonance was actually very simple.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of these cultivators had no background and had only reached this level today by relying on their own cultivation efforts.</p><p></p><p>Most of them were at the Foundation Establishment stage, with a few at the Golden Core stage.</p><p></p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators were even rarer, one in a thousand.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's bewitching voice echoed in their ears.</p><p></p><p>"Humph, these families control Luoyan State, we lowly cultivators may never have a chance to make a name for ourselves in this life."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, we don't get any of the good things. We don't even have the right to know what happened..."</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk tsk, what a life we're living."</p><p></p><p>"Relying on cultivation alone, without resources, how high of a realm can one cultivate to? Without a cave heaven, even a peerless genius will be trapped at the Nascent Soul stage. I see those disciples of the big families, they may not necessarily be stronger than me. For example, that Young Master Cai, lacking nothing, yet still at the late Golden Core stage. He is truly a complete waste! If it were me..."</p><p></p><p>...</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1174</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>As the commander of the Qingxuan Army, Shang Shaojun had suppressed the Chituo Abyss for a hundred years. Even in the face of such a terrifying world-destroying demonic sound wave, he could remain calm and composed.</p><p></p><p>But now, he truly felt a deep-rooted fear that he hadn't experienced in a long time.</p><p></p><p>There were simply too many dead cultivators in this frozen sea.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun couldn't even imagine where these cultivators came from.</p><p></p><p>The number of cultivators buried here was probably more than the entire Xuanhuang Realm!</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan also pretended to be frightened by the scene before him, his body trembling slightly and his face showing a look of horror.</p><p></p><p>"Shaojun, don't act rashly and be careful," he said, as if coming back to his senses after a while, reassuring Shang Shaojun.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun's face still looked grim, and he kept looking around from time to time, as if there were some unknown enemies hidden around.</p><p></p><p>"There's something wrong here. Did you hear any sounds?" Shang Shaojun asked telepathically.</p><p></p><p>"Sounds? What sounds?" The Holy Fetus Li Fan was somewhat surprised, and this was not an act.</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun said with a gloomy face, "Perhaps it's because I've been in the Chituo Abyss for a long time, I'm more sensitive to any sounds. Ever since I came to this maze, I've been hearing some kind of whisper from time to time. You didn't hear it?"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This was not his first time coming here.</p><p></p><p>He had even guided various cultivators to come here.</p><p></p><p>But no one was like Shang Shaojun, who could actually hear mysterious sounds in the dead silence of the frozen sea.</p><p></p><p>With a different thought in mind, the Holy Fetus Li Fan said solemnly, "What does Shaojun think? There must be a great secret involved here. But similarly, if we want to investigate, we must also take great risks. Should we leave before being discovered, or should we explore it?"</p><p></p><p>Shang Shaojun didn't answer Li Fan immediately. Instead, his ears moved slightly, as if trying to discern the sound he heard.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he explained telepathically, "Brother Li, follow me. I have a feeling that tracing the source of this sound may unravel some of the mysteries of this place."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus Li Fan nodded slightly, his sword shadow unsheathed and guarding the two of them.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful."</p><p></p><p>The two shuttled through the endless frozen sea.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Li Fan had long been clear about the overall structure of the "Reverse Life and Death Grand Formation".</p><p></p><p>However, since he pretended to be here for the first time, even though he saw Shang Shaojun leading him around in circles within the formation, he didn't expose it.</p><p></p><p>He just followed behind in silence.</p><p></p><p>But as Shang Shaojun stubbornly kept advancing in a certain direction, the Holy Fetus Li Fan also noticed the subtle changes in the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>It had even escaped the analysis of the Doomsday Separation Disc, which he had overlooked before!</p><p></p><p>"There's actually this hidden change in the grand formation? No wonder it can prove the Dao of immortality." Li Fan was secretly shocked.</p><p></p><p>They continued to advance.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like they were walking in place, but the frozen coffins in the surrounding dead sea kept rotating around them.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li, be careful. It seems that the source of the sound is right ahead!" Shang Shaojun's voice was also a bit nervous.</p><p></p><p>It was like passing through a long and narrow space-time tunnel, with the surroundings turning into layers of overlapping lines due to the rapid speed.</p><p></p><p>When they broke through the end of the tunnel, countless circles converged into a point.</p><p></p><p>Then it exploded in their vision with a bang.</p><p></p><p>It was suddenly clear.</p><p></p><p>But the surrounding air became even colder.</p><p></p><p>It even made the Holy Fetus Li Fan and Shang Shaojun feel...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>They were so frozen that their bodies became stiff.</p><p></p><p>"Phew..."</p><p></p><p>They activated their internal spiritual power, trying to dispel the bone-piercing cold.</p><p></p><p>The two carefully observed their surroundings.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be the interior of a silver-white light sphere. Except for the somewhat blurry boundaries, there was nothing here.</p><p></p><p>But when they looked back in the direction they came from, what caught their eyes made their pupils suddenly contract.</p><p></p><p>Like a yin-yang fish, constantly rotating small spheres were quietly floating in the air.</p><p></p><p>From the dim parts, Saint Embryo Li Fan could vaguely sense the aura of the previously dead and frozen sea.</p><p></p><p>And inside this white light sphere, there were actually eight more of these yin-yang small spheres!</p><p></p><p>A total of nine, forming a special shape.</p><p></p><p>Shao Jun swallowed his saliva with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Just one of the yin-yang spheres contained countless numbers of the dead.</p><p></p><p>If this number was multiplied by nine...</p><p></p><p>The two looked at each other and saw the fear in each other's hearts.</p><p></p><p>Even their telepathic communication became cautious.</p><p></p><p>For fear of disturbing the nine yin-yang spheres here.</p><p></p><p>"Shao Jun, the voice you heard before..."</p><p></p><p>"It's gone. As soon as we entered here, it abruptly stopped and mysteriously disappeared. Wait..."</p><p></p><p>Shao Jun suddenly froze and turned to look in the opposite direction of the yin-yang spheres.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful."</p><p></p><p>Shao Jun only gave a cautious reminder and stopped talking.</p><p></p><p>His body stiffened and no longer moved. His breath instantly became extremely faint.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Saint Embryo Li Fan realized that some invisible existence seemed to have descended into this space.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>Although there was no concrete sound, the heavy footsteps stepped firmly on Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>The distance was getting closer and closer.</p><p></p><p>It did not pay attention to the two who had rashly intruded, but came straight to the vicinity of the nine yin-yang spheres.</p><p></p><p>Whew...</p><p></p><p>The sound of gently blowing air arose.</p><p></p><p>The space near the yin-yang spheres also showed bursts of distorted fluctuations because of this.</p><p></p><p>Just like being boiled in boiling water, the yin and yang parts on the nine small spheres rotated around each other and became more distinct.</p><p></p><p>Shao Jun and Li Fan clearly saw that, as if blown by this unknown existence, wisps of frozen corpses entered the nine yin-yang spheres.</p><p></p><p>The entire bizarre process did not last long.</p><p></p><p>The oppressive footsteps gradually receded, and this silver-white space slowly returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>The nine yin-yang spheres also slowly settled and became calm again.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, the two communicated telepathically.</p><p></p><p>"Just now, what exactly was that?"</p><p></p><p>"The sense of crisis was like needles pricking all over the body, and the spiritual perception in the heart was frantically warning. As if a great calamity would befall at any time... Even an Immortal Venerable might not be able to bring about this feeling, right?"</p><p></p><p>After a few short sentences, the two fell into an extremely oppressive silence.</p><p></p><p>"The sound I heard just now should be the echoes of that unknown existence's footsteps here," Shao Jun speculated. "Even though it has left, the lingering sound still persists."</p><p></p><p>"The countless frozen corpses in the yin-yang spheres seem to be the handiwork of that fellow. But I still can't figure out where so many corpses came from. Also, what would be outside this silver-white space?"</p><p></p><p>These questions, Saint Embryo Li Fan also could not answer.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they thought this was only the Immortal Venerable's Daochang. But unexpectedly, in this life, by a fluke, they actually discovered a deeper secret hidden behind it.</p>

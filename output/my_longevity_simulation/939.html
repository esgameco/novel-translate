        <h1>Chapter 939</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>These strangely dressed and equipped monks were different from the projections summoned from the Immortal Sect's armory. They had no combat skills to speak of and relied entirely on their weapons to gain the upper hand in battle.</p><p></p><p>But these monks had a strange characteristic.</p><p></p><p>They were fearless in the face of death.</p><p></p><p>If their companions were killed, not only would they not feel sad or pained, but their faces would show expressions of mockery and laughter.</p><p></p><p>Even when it was their turn to die, they showed no fear.</p><p></p><p>Only some regret and defiance.</p><p></p><p>Under the combined force of multiple resistance forces, the offensive of the Myriad Immortal Alliance was held back.</p><p></p><p>And there were signs that the front line was being pushed back.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the decision made by the Myriad Immortal Alliance was somewhat unexpected.</p><p></p><p>They did not stubbornly persist in continuing the attack.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they quit while they were ahead. Just as when they came, they retreated in an orderly manner, covering each other.</p><p></p><p>The image of the Tianxuan Mirror was suddenly interrupted at this point.</p><p></p><p>This instant contrast before and after immediately aroused the dissatisfaction of the cultivators who were watching the live broadcast excitedly in front of the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"That's it? Retreating at a little setback?"</p><p></p><p>"There's still fighting to be done! Why retreat!"</p><p></p><p>"So afraid of death? If you don't dare to fight, I do! Let me on the battlefield!"</p><p></p><p>"Who gave the order to retreat? They really deserve to be killed!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The crowd was in an uproar, but it could not change the decision on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>That day, the Myriad Immortal Alliance issued another announcement.</p><p></p><p>It stated that the battles of the past few days were a manifestation of their own strength and a small warning to the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>The previous promise remained unchanged. If the Five Elders Council was willing to hand over the Immortal Alliance's treasures, then everything was still negotiable.</p><p></p><p>If the Five Elders Council remained obstinate, then the Myriad Immortal Alliance might come knocking every few days to reap the spoils.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was war or peace was entirely up to the Five Elders Council to decide!</p><p></p><p>Obviously, this announcement was a naked threat.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the Five Elders Council would have simply treated it with disdain, and might have even made a similar announcement in response, tit-for-tat, with sarcasm and mockery.</p><p></p><p>But times have changed.</p><p></p><p>This surprise attack by the Myriad Immortal Alliance had really scared them.</p><p></p><p>Only that giant net of patrolling arrows used in coordination with the Celestial Venerable Dharma could actually affect the five Perpetual Celestial Venerables!</p><p></p><p>It should be known that, unlike the Dharma Transmission Celestial Venerable who was basically just a legend in the Myriad Immortal Alliance, the five Celestial Venerables truly existed and governed the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>And from time to time, "Celestial Venerable Edicts" would be issued.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the five Celestial Venerables held a position of absolute authority in the hearts of the cultivators of the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>So one can imagine how shocked they were when they discovered that the weapons of the Myriad Immortal Alliance could actually harm the five Celestial Venerables who were like deities to them.</p><p></p><p>In a panic, being caught off guard and penetrated deeply by the Myriad Immortal Alliance was understandable.</p><p></p><p>Although they finally reacted and launched a counterattack, temporarily repelling the Myriad Immortal Alliance,</p><p></p><p>in these days when the authority of the Celestial Venerable Scepter had not yet been fully restored, chaos still spread within the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>Those cultivators who were accustomed to the existence of the Celestial Venerable's laws were exposed for the first time to the true Profound Yellow Realm without the Celestial Venerable's principles.</p><p></p><p>The impact on them was shocking.</p><p></p><p>For example, when the cultivators of the True Reality State suddenly discovered that they could lie.</p><p></p><p>In an environment where all the people subconsciously believed that there were no lies in the world,</p><p></p><p>The power of lies is destructive.</p><p></p><p>After the monks tasted the benefits brought by lies, the lies also spread in the former country of truth at a terrifying speed.</p><p></p><p>It can be foreseen that before the power of the celestial tribe is restored, such chaos will never disappear on its own.</p><p></p><p>The so-called strong is respected.</p><p></p><p>Now the strength of the Wanxian Alliance is enough to deal a fatal blow to the Five Elders Conference. So the Five Elders Conference had no choice but to soften.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, the Five Elders Conference is not clear that the thirty-three immortal candidates who can invoke the Heavenly Venerable Dharma Appearance have all been sacrificed.</p><p></p><p>From their perspective, those Heavenly Venerable Dharma Appearances are like the Heavenly Patrol Arrows, which are forces that can be used again at any time.</p><p></p><p>So the threat of the Wanxian Alliance is something they must face.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, a delegation of more than ten monks from the Five Elders Conference came to the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Nominally, it was to negotiate in a friendly manner, but in fact, it was a humiliating peace.</p><p></p><p>And they did bring the so-called [Immortal Alliance Relic].</p><p></p><p>This made the Wanxian Alliance monks laugh for a while.</p><p></p><p>The public does not know the specific content of the agreement reached.</p><p></p><p>But obviously, the Wanxian Alliance is very satisfied with the price paid by the Five Elders Conference.</p><p></p><p>There was no more mention of getting justice.</p><p></p><p>After the Five Elders Conference delegation left in a gray manner, a large-scale reward for meritorious service began.</p><p></p><p>Those black-clothed monks did not mention it, but only introduced the commander-in-chief of this expedition against the Five Elders Conference to the public at length.</p><p></p><p>Dharma Preacher, Jiang.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Patrol Arrows and Heavenly Venerable Dharma Appearances, which played a crucial role in the surprise attack, were all planned by him.</p><p></p><p>This is also the first time that the Dharma Preacher has appeared in the eyes of the Wanxian Alliance public.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the widely circulated figure, a thin middle-aged man who looked ordinary. Only the goatee on his chin was the most eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>"It's strange that the always low-key Dharma Preacher chose to actively expose himself." Li Fan frowned slightly, a little puzzled.</p><p></p><p>This has never happened in the previous reincarnation experiences.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan speculated that it might have something to do with Mo Rubin, the young Dharma Preacher who was possessed.</p><p></p><p>There is also a power struggle between the Dharma Preachers.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin tried to control the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror through the formation.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it aroused the sense of crisis of some people.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in this expedition, he established meritorious service to stabilize his position.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan felt something was wrong in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The plan of the Heavenly Patrol Arrows and the immortal candidates has been laid out for a long time.</p><p></p><p>It is obviously premeditated for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin's disguise as a Dharma Preacher is just a recent thing.</p><p></p><p>"Or..."</p><p></p><p>"Is it really for the so-called [Immortal Alliance Relic]?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly focused his attention on this "excuse" that all the monks in the Immortal Alliance thought.</p><p></p><p>"If it's true, what on earth is worth the Wanxian Alliance going to such great lengths?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that it's time for our Wanjie United Association to take action again."</p><p></p><p>Thinking so, Li Qing's avatar felt something, went out of the Lingmu Realm again, and went straight to the territory of the Five Elders Conference.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Patrol Arrows have been exhausted, and the method of secretly leaving marks on the border protection formation has been cracked by Li Fan with the Doomsday Dissociation Disc.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing did not encounter any trouble along the way.</p><p></p><p>The Wanxian Alliance, which had just won a big victory, obviously relaxed its guard. Li Qing easily broke through the line and infiltrated the Five Elders Conference.</p><p></p><p>The few states on the border were looted by the Wanxian Alliance. After scanning with divine sense, not even half a living person could be found.</p><p></p><p>All the way to perform the secret art of contact, he advanced towards the hinterland of the Five Elders Conference.</p><p></p><p>It was not until he crossed five states that monks gradually appeared.</p>

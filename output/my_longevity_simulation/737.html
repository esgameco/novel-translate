        <h1>Chapter 737</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the Rift World Divine Weapon, Li Fan only saw the angry expression on Ji Wangxian's face suddenly freeze. Not only him, but the entire Xuanhuang Realm seemed to have fallen into a state of stillness.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, the scene accelerated at a speed hundreds of times faster.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan saw several figures arrive late and engage in battle with Ji Wangxian. In the end, Ji Wangxian retreated in a disheveled state, seemingly heavily injured.</p><p></p><p>This "Ji Zhaoxuan" body felt a sense of clarity in the mind and comfort in body and spirit.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Li Fan saw that it seemed to be due to the impact of the Rift World Divine Weapon tearing apart the Xuanhuang Realm. The originally rich in spiritual energy and suitable for cultivators to reside, Tianjian Mountain, had become extremely dangerous. Wind and thunder flashed, and black cracks often split open the space, exactly the same as the scene he had seen in the rift vortex in the real world.</p><p></p><p>Then...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan vaguely saw a solitary white-robed figure. Standing in front of the rift ruins, silent. Then with a light wave of the hand, the anomalies gradually disappeared, and the space slowly stabilized.</p><p></p><p>After completing this, the white-robed figure did not linger but quickly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The scene continued to change rapidly after that.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators from different sects came to divide the territory of the Tianjian Sect. No one was willing to concede, and a great battle broke out.</p><p></p><p>Calamities descended, and countless cultivators slaughtered each other. The sky turned dark, and there were only cultivator corpses everywhere, with no trace of the living.</p><p></p><p>"These... are they scenes of the future?" After the image became distorted and could no longer be seen, Li Fan turned to Situo Yao and asked in a daze.</p><p></p><p>Situo Yao, who had been carefully observing the scene outside the divine weapon, took a while before shifting his gaze.</p><p></p><p>Raising the wine gourd, he drained it in one gulp: "Not the future, but the present."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze sharpened.</p><p></p><p>The external scene had completely turned pitch black, like a lost traveler entering the night. The fate awaiting the Tianjian Sect was completely unknown.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, can we really succeed in the rift?" In the darkness, it seemed that countless fierce beasts were lurking, ready to devour. Li Fan couldn't help but ask, feeling a sense of anxiety and unease.</p><p></p><p>Situo Yao took another mouthful: "Who knows? After all, we should be the first ones to sneak out of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"If we don't succeed, we can just die. Anyway, if we stay, we'll most likely not live long either."</p><p></p><p>As if echoing Situo Yao's words, the Rift World Divine Weapon suddenly darkened and then fell into stillness.</p><p></p><p>Like a shattered mirror, it returned to the distorted space.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the three dimming light masses in front of him, Li Fan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"Inside the Rift World Divine Weapon, only a moment has passed, but outside, it seems to have been decades or even hundreds of years. It seems to be similar to the Immortal Ruins. I see, only the power that can distort space-time can break free from the constraints of the Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, Li Fan finally returned to the real world.</p><p></p><p>Since he had fulfilled Ji Zhaoxuan's wish, he should have gained something.</p><p></p><p>Not the "Exhale Condense Sword Technique" that Ji Zhaoxuan cultivated, but a pile of sword embryo spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan revealed a strange expression as he counted them, finding a total of 326.</p><p></p><p>Randomly taking out one, he held it in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, a continuous stream of insights into the Dao of the Sword surged into his mind. And Li Fan also felt a sense of familiarity, as if he had once grasped it before.</p><p></p><p>"These should be the sword embryo spirit stones that Ji Zhaoxuan had absorbed in the true historical timeline..."</p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This is the Sword Embryo Primal Stone. It condenses the true essence of the Sword Dao. For sword cultivators, it may be of great value. But for me, it has little use."</p><p>"With Xu Bai, that human-shaped enlightenment machine, even giving him an ordinary wooden sword, he can comprehend it on his own. It would just take a bit more time."</p><p>"Instead, the material of this Primal Stone is quite good. It can be used as a forging material for the Rift Divinity Armaments, or perhaps to reinforce the Mysterious Yellow True Cauldron, so that it can withstand the onslaught of the Immortal Abyss even longer."</p><p>Li Fan put away half of them and tossed the remaining hundred-plus pieces to Fang Zaijie.</p><p>Fang Zaijie was completely immersed in the research of the "Doomsday Stone Tablet", carefully directing Jiang Yushan and Liu San to carefully cut the stone tablet.</p><p>He casually put away the Sword Embryo Primal Stones without much examination.</p><p>Li Fan observed for a while without interrupting.</p><p>He then returned to the secret chamber.</p><p>"In the Fallen Immortal Realm, the harvest is closely related to the resolution of one's obsession. These Sword Embryo Primal Stones, their value in the 'Heavenly Sword Sect Forging' scene is just ordinary."</p><p>Li Fan had some clues in mind, and after pondering for a while, he temporarily set it aside.</p><p>He took out the "Separation Disc" and the "Heavenly Mirror", two relics left by Huangfu Song.</p><p>First, he examined the Heavenly Mirror.</p><p>It had already become an ordinary mirror, and no matter how he tried to connect with it spiritually, there was no response.</p><p>"No wonder, even though Huangfu Song borrowed it from Gong Hongdao, when we went to the Huanyu Separate Abode to inform him of Huangfu Song's death, he didn't ask to have it returned. It must be like the Heavenly Profound Mirrors in each state, once the empowerment is withdrawn, it will lose its divine properties."</p><p>Li Fan played with it for a while, feeling a bit of regret.</p><p>Then he focused his attention on the Separation Disc.</p><p>Compared to when it was just exchanged out, the luster of the Separation Disc in Li Fan's hand seemed to have dimmed a bit.</p><p>The difference was very small, and if one didn't observe carefully, it would be easy to overlook.</p><p>But Li Fan knew that this was because the remaining eight Separation Discs had already begun to iterate and evolve.</p><p>His, or rather Huangfu Song's, was still in its initial state, and its abilities were gradually being absorbed by the other Separation Discs.</p><p>"Huangfu, Huangfu. It's not that I didn't try to preserve you, but it's the disc itself that disappeared. I can't be blamed for that."</p><p>Li Fan murmured to himself, holding the Separation Disc in his palm.</p><p>In an instant, the crystal in his mind emitted a deep blue light, and countless basic formation patterns were inputted into the Separation Disc.</p><p>According to the normal cultivation process, the cultivator needs to first outline the basic framework of the formation in their mind, and then infuse it with their spiritual will. The basic formations are not too difficult for a formation master.</p><p>But as the formations become more complex, the effort and time required will increase.</p><p>However, with the secret art of "Dao Crystallization Divinity", Li Fan did not have this trouble.</p><p>Since he had learned formations from Zhang Zhiliang, all the various formations he had encountered were clearly preserved in the Dao Crystal. He could freely invoke them without having to recall or outline them.</p><p>At first, this advantage was not very obvious.</p><p>But as the Separation Disc evolved, requiring more and more complex formations, the gap would gradually become apparent.</p><p>Of course, those who could exchange for the Separation Disc in this world were all exceptional talents.</p><p>The remaining eight, each must have their own secret arts.</p><p>Li Fan would not underestimate any of them.</p><p>In addition to the Dao Crystallization Divinity, he had other resources to rely on.</p>

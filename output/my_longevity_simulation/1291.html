        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1286: The Holy Emperor Establishes a New Law (7K words)</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xu's expression was solemn as he stroked his beard and said, "The resonance between bloodlines is profound and mysterious, yet one cannot help but believe it. Brother Sun, perhaps you can have someone pass a message to your family to confirm."</p><p></p><p>Hua Yueye echoed this sentiment.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, fellow Daoists, for your guidance." Sun Ang, who was actually Li Fan's true self, pondered for a moment before sending out a spirit talisman that flew outside the Yanfa Jue space.</p><p></p><p>Each Zhen Shou Hedao could only obtain one chance to use this spirit talisman after guarding for a hundred years. If it weren't for Xuyuan's previous "care" that reduced "Sun Ang's" guarding time by a hundred years, he would not have been able to contact the outside world even if he wanted to now.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, the head of the Sun family, Sun Luyuan, personally rushed over.</p><p></p><p>"Your eldest uncle has unfortunately fallen."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression first showed shock, then turned into self-blame and grief. "When eldest uncle was about to leave, I had a vague premonition..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan comforted, "Life and death are unpredictable. Lu Chang's fall has nothing to do with you. Lu'er, you don't need to blame yourself."</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan paused, then changed his words and said, "Recently, there have been many troubles, but with me here, the Sun family will not collapse. You can stay here at ease."</p><p></p><p>"When necessary, I will find a way to get you out."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan solemnly promised.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that the Sun family had already pledged allegiance to the Shengchao Daqi, Li Fan naturally understood the true meaning behind Sun Luyuan's words. However, at this moment, he could only pretend, "I can endure it. I can't waste any more of the family's resources because of me."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as the two members of the Sun family were putting on a show of deep familial affection, Fu Yuansheng, whom Li Fan had possessed, was facing towering malice from different people within his family.</p><p></p><p>"Little Sheng, what dog shit luck did you have to be fortunate enough to obtain a Hedao cultivation technique?"</p><p></p><p>"Yuansheng, the family has treated you well these years, right? It's time for you to repay the family."</p><p></p><p>"Sheng'er, in less than two days, more than a dozen Huashen cultivators have come to our door. Any one of them is someone our Fu family cannot afford to offend! For the future of the Fu family, why don't you just hand over this cultivation technique?"</p><p></p><p>"Fu Yuansheng, don't think that being lucky for a while means you'll be lucky forever! You're just a mere Jindan minor cultivator, how can you protect a Hedao true technique? Rather than having it forcibly taken away later, it's better to hand it over voluntarily and gain a bright future!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he left the headquarters of the Wanxian Alliance, the previously blocked messages poured in. The greed and malice in their words were undisguised, almost causing one's spiritual qi circulation to stall. If the current Fu Yuansheng was still the original Fu Yuansheng, he would have likely had his Dao heart shattered on the spot by the coercion of his own relatives.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the messages that still hadn't stopped and had even become more intense due to the long lack of response. His expression couldn't help but become subtle.</p><p></p><p>"The evil in human hearts has reached this extent!"</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the local environment nurtures the local people. Within the Shengchao realm, such things would never happen. The Wanxian Alliance's fate is sealed!"</p><p></p><p>"Let me give it another push!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly, then his expression instantly turned bitter and filled with grief and indignation.</p><p></p><p>He didn't return to the Fu family, but instead openly appeared in front of the world through the transmission array, arriving at Tianshu Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Fu Yuansheng's appearance attracted the attention of some people.</p><p></p><p>Even those who were unaware noticed the strange looks from the surrounding crowd. After some inquiries, they instantly understood.</p><p></p><p>The focus of everyone's attention, Fu Yuansheng, seemed to be forced and fled in a panic.</p><p></p><p>Many onlooking cultivators quickly chased after him.</p><p></p><p>A Jindan cultivator's flying speed couldn't be that fast. Soon, there was a large crowd following behind Fu Yuansheng.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that there were really that many people coveting the cultivation technique. The vast majority were just there to join in the excitement.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pretended to have a frightened expression, but was actually leisurely leading this group of people.</p><p></p><p>He was waiting for an opportunity to completely ignite the incident.</p><p></p><p>After aimlessly flying for most of the day, the person Li Fan was waiting for finally appeared.</p><p></p><p>It should be Fu Yuansheng's nominal father, Fu Linmu.</p><p></p><p>"You unfilial son, the family head summoned you, but you didn't return. What exactly do you want to do?" As soon as Fu Linmu appeared, he scolded Fu Yuansheng harshly.</p><p></p><p>Behind Fu Linmu stood a cultivator with his arms crossed and eyes slightly narrowed. Judging by his aura, he should have Huashen cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stopped and seemed to be very afraid of his own father.</p><p></p><p>Fu Linmu continued to persuade him emotionally and rationally, and then introduced the identity of the squinting Huashen cultivator behind him.</p><p></p><p>"This is Senior Fu Tongtian from Tianquan Prefecture. He can be considered our main family."</p><p></p><p>"Our Fu family really can't protect your Hedao cultivation technique. Leaving it in your hands is a disaster, not a blessing. Why don't you give it to Senior Fu..."</p><p></p><p>After Fu Linmu's persuasion, Li Fan seemed to struggle painfully for a while and was about to compromise.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, another uninvited guest arrived.</p><p></p><p>It was another elder of the Fu family, bringing another Huashen, wanting to fight for the ownership of the Hedao true technique.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pretended to be a little dazed, not knowing who to listen to.</p><p></p><p>While the two Huashens were at odds with each other, more Huashen cultivators heard the news and hurried over.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, it's just a Hedao cultivation technique. It's not worth fighting to the death over. Why don't we discuss it peacefully?" Someone suggested, but directly ignored the opinion of Fu Yuansheng, the owner of the technique, already considering it their own.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad. If the price is too high, we might as well go to Tianxuan Mirror and purchase it honestly."</p><p></p><p>"Why don't we first hear what kind of technique this prodigy of the Fu family had Yanfa Jue derive?"</p><p></p><p>The group of Huashens quickly reached a consensus and looked at Li Fan in unison.</p><p></p><p>Little did they know that this move was exactly what Li Fan wanted.</p><p></p><p>Before entering the Yanfa Jue space, he had already calculated that he would use this technique to stir up a storm. Therefore, the blueprint techniques he provided to Yanfa Jue were all of extremely high standards.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, disguised as Fu Yuansheng, showed a pained expression. Finally, with no choice, he took a deep breath and said word by word, "The technique I obtained is called the Tongtian Yingling Huashen Technique."</p><p></p><p>"The current new law is going against the heavens. However, to break through realms, one still has to rely on various resources between heaven and earth. It's fine for those aristocratic families, but for people like us without power or influence, even with exceptional talent, we are still limited!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's words caused many cultivators present to have slight changes in expression and deeply resonate with him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued, "So, I always dreamed that one day, I could break free from this limitation. Thanks to Senior Qianxun's favor and the gift of the Jifa Jade Tablet, I finally had the opportunity to turn my dream into reality."</p><p></p><p>"This Tongtian Yingling Huashen Technique can continuously strengthen one's resonance with the primordial world, greatly reducing the hostility of the Heavenly Dao. Then, relying on the resonance connection with heaven and earth, one can find Yuanyuan Dongtian and the necessary materials for breakthroughs like Jiangsheng Zhi Bian. Even refining it to a profound level, sensing the location of the Heavenly Dao's soul is also easy..."</p><p></p><p>"With this technique, as long as you give me, Fu Yuansheng, some time, achieving Hedao is not a pipe dream. But I never thought, never thought..."</p><p></p><p>"The Wanxian Alliance would force me, a bottom-level cultivator, to this extent! Not giving me any chance at all!"</p><p></p><p>The more Li Fan spoke, the more grief and indignation he showed, his eyes filled with blood.</p><p></p><p>He then directly waved his hand, revealing the general outline of the Tongtian Yingling Huashen Technique for all to see.</p><p></p><p>With just one glance, the Hedao cultivators present could already see the extraordinary nature of this technique.</p><p></p><p>It was definitely not something a mere Jindan cultivator could make up.</p><p></p><p>The group of Huashens had various expressions. The atmosphere suddenly became tense and solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Enough."</p><p></p><p>One of them erased the text in the sky, then looked around at everyone. "The value of this technique, I don't think it needs to be said."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, there are differences between Hedao techniques. If what this kid said is true, the value of this Hedao technique is truly the highest I've ever seen in my life."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I think even if half of us here die, as long as we can win the technique, it's worth it!"</p><p></p><p>The Huashen cultivators spoke one after another, and the tension gradually increased.</p><p></p><p>The Fu family members present had increasingly miserable expressions.</p><p></p><p>If they had known earlier that the technique Fu Yuansheng comprehended was such a supreme one that could create an immortal cultivation family, no matter what, they should have tried to protect him!</p><p></p><p>Even if they had to add more conditions when selling it?</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the Fu family's regret, the final ownership of the Tongtian Yingling Huashen Technique was interrupted by a newly ascended Hedao.</p><p></p><p>This person was called Chiyu Immortal Venerable. A few days ago, he had just broken through to the Hedao realm.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't found a suitable cultivation technique yet, so he happened to hear about Fu Yuansheng's matter and joined in the excitement.</p><p></p><p>The difference between Hedao and Huashen was like the difference between heaven and earth. If Chiyu wanted it, the group of Huashens naturally couldn't compete with him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Chiyu wasn't alone. He also had the backing of an influential family.</p><p></p><p>In the end, under the coercion of both his power and influence, the Huashens present all withdrew from the competition.</p><p></p><p>To avoid any mishaps, the final victor, Chiyu Immortal Venerable, wanted Fu Yuansheng to hand over the technique on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"I hope Senior, after obtaining this technique, can still show some care to our Fu family."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed deeply, his words making the Fu family members present feel ashamed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chiyu approaching, Li Fan transmitted the complete Tongtian Yingling Huashen Technique to him with his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>"It really is a supreme wonderful technique." Chiyu was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Little Fu, sign this contract. It indicates that you voluntarily give up ownership of the technique. Don't worry, I won't mistreat your Fu family..." Chiyu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"This junior obeys." Li Fan lowered his head and was about to take the golden contract.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment...</p><p></p><p>Perhaps affected by the previous text of the Tongtian Yingling Huashen Technique, Chiyu suddenly felt a little dazed.</p><p></p><p>The Fu Yuansheng in front of him seemed like a hideous monster that would only appear in nightmares, pouncing at him with bared fangs and brandished claws. In the next moment, it was about to lunge at his face.</p><p></p><p>Chiyu was startled and subconsciously sent out a red light.</p><p></p><p>It hit Fu Yuansheng's body.</p><p></p><p>The might of a Hedao, even a casual strike made unintentionally, how could a Jindan cultivator withstand it?</p><p></p><p>With an expression of disbelief on his face, Fu Yuansheng's body disintegrated inch by inch in an instant and his dao was extinguished!</p><p></p><p>This sudden turn of events instantly stunned everyone.</p><p></p><p>They all looked at Chiyu Immortal Venerable, who had committed the crime in public, with shock.</p><p></p><p>Chiyu himself was also a little surprised.</p><p></p><p>He stared blankly at his own palm.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I just broke through and the influence of the Heavenly Dao's soul on me hasn't completely subsided?"</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, this Tongtian Yingling Huashen Technique is already in my hands." This was the second thought that flashed through Chiyu's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Sheng'er!" After a deadly silence, the Fu family members finally reacted.</p><p></p><p>Many people, regardless of the huge gap between them and the Hedao cultivator, stared at Chiyu with utter hatred.</p><p></p><p>Above, the phenomenon of his fall came belatedly, telling the cause of Fu Yuansheng's death.</p><p></p><p>As for Chiyu, the perpetrator, looking at the eyes of these ants, he vaguely felt very uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>However, he was in the wrong after all. In public, it was not good to make a scene.</p><p></p><p>He only said, "Don't worry, this venerable's word is his bond. I won't mistreat your Fu family."</p><p></p><p>The sobbing of the Fu family members gradually stopped.</p><p></p><p>After all, the person was already dead. There was no need to court death and offend a Hedao for the sake of a dead man.</p><p></p><p>Chiyu left with the Fu family members.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It seems that this cultivation technique is too precious. Crimson Willow Immortal Venerable chose to kill to silence them in order to ensure absolute secrecy."</p><p></p><p>"He doesn't even trust the contract? This newly ascended Harmonious Dao cultivator is too suspicious."</p><p></p><p>"What good is a contract? There are all sorts of mysterious methods in the world. What if one could violate the contract without being punished?"</p><p></p><p>"And this is with so many people watching. If it were in private, he would probably act even more recklessly!"</p><p></p><p>"Harmonious Dao cultivators are truly impressive! Even the Immortal Alliance laws become optional at their level, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Naturally. It's obvious that the Immortal Alliance couldn't possibly punish a Harmonious Dao cultivator just for the sake of an insignificant Golden Core cultivator. Even if they did, it would certainly just be for show."</p><p></p><p>"Once one enters the Harmonious Dao, things are indeed very different. Just like previously, only Harmonious Dao cultivators have the qualifications to leave the realm and roam the starry seas."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators chatted until they lost interest and left one after another. </p><p></p><p>However, the remaining large number of Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, and Nascent Soul cultivators did not leave for a long time.</p><p></p><p>They looked up at the remnants of the fallen phenomenon in the sky, feeling the grief of the hare's death.</p><p></p><p>Under the influence of a mysterious power they could not perceive, this emotion gradually turned into a raging flame, slowly igniting.</p><p></p><p>"In the eyes of the Immortal Alliance higher-ups, we are truly like ants."</p><p></p><p>"What about the Immortal Alliance laws? It turns out they only apply to us?"</p><p></p><p>"Today, it was Fu Yuansheng who died unjustly. Who among us will be wrongfully killed tomorrow?"</p><p></p><p>In the silence, a strange atmosphere was brewing.</p><p></p><p>Although they didn't say it out loud, everything was already revealed in the looks they exchanged.</p><p></p><p>However, constrained by the Immortal Alliance's deterrence, none of them dared to voice their thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps...</p><p></p><p>What they needed was an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, the onlooking cultivators finally dispersed.</p><p></p><p>A wisp of Li Fan's divine sense transformed into a phantom and reappeared in the world.</p><p></p><p>"Now that the flames are burning, they will likely spread throughout the entire Immortal Alliance even without me fanning them." Li Fan was very satisfied with his masterpiece.</p><p></p><p>The subsequent developments were just as he had anticipated.</p><p></p><p>Although the image of Crimson Willow Immortal Venerable striking down Fu Yuansheng in broad daylight quickly spread throughout the Immortal Alliance via the Heavenly Profound Mirror, the Fu family had already expressed their understanding of Crimson Willow's momentary lapse due to his unstable cultivation after just breaking through. Therefore, the Immortal Alliance no longer pursued his responsibility and only symbolically fined him some contribution points.</p><p></p><p>Instead, after the news spread that Crimson Willow himself had obtained the Heavenly Response Incarnation Technique, countless families inquired about the truth of the matter.</p><p></p><p>They also expressed their willingness to pay a high price in exchange for Crimson Willow's help in sensing and finding the location of the world's spiritual qi.</p><p></p><p>For a time, the status of the newly ascended Crimson Willow Harmonious Dao cultivator was even higher than some veteran Harmonious Dao cultivators.</p><p></p><p>As for the innocent Fu Yuansheng who died tragically, he was slowly forgotten as time passed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"How ironic! The guilty goes unpunished and is even rewarded instead."</p><p></p><p>In the Great Enlightenment of the Sacred Dynasty, Wang Xuanba read the article in his hand and sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>"If this were in our Great Enlightenment, let alone ordinary officials, even if I, the personally taught disciple of the Sacred Emperor, committed such a thing, I would be severely punished. At the very least, I would be imprisoned in the dark prison for several hundred years. How could it be brushed off so lightly? The Immortal Alliance is really... no, the Immortal Alliance is really corrupt!"</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian shook his head repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang glanced at Ou Shangtian and smiled helplessly, "Master's intention is that this matter can be used as a typical case for propaganda and pre-battle mobilization."</p><p></p><p>"It can even be used to shake the foundation of the Immortal Alliance. After all, the vast majority of cultivators in the Immortal Alliance are below the Nascent Soul stage."</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian pouted, "What's the use of rallying these wastes? I'll kill as many as come!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang's expression changed, "Don't talk nonsense! The righteous will gain much support, while the unrighteous will lose support. The Immortal Alliance has lost the hearts of the people, so our Sacred Dynasty's conquest is in line with the will of the people."</p><p></p><p>"With a righteous cause and acting in accordance with the Dao, we will be invincible in battle!"</p><p></p><p>As the eldest senior brother, Ou Shangtian didn't dare to refute, but he muttered softly, "No matter what you say, in the end, it still depends on strength."</p><p></p><p>"Shangtian, how is the construction of your Myriad Phenomena Transmission Formation going?" Sun Erlang asked.</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian showed a proud expression, "Senior Brother, just leave it to me. I have completed the positioning of all the states in the Immortal Alliance. As soon as Master gives the order, the soldiers of our Great Enlightenment can instantly travel to the designated states through the Myriad Phenomena Transmission Formation. Then, using the Samantabhadra True Boats and the cover of the White Mist Barrier, we will be able to arrive undetected under the sky cities of each state!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba also continued, "The several moles planted within the Immortal Alliance have also completed the connection. As soon as the time comes, the Heavenly Profound Mirrors and transmission formations of each state in the Immortal Alliance will fail."</p><p></p><p>A map of the Immortal Alliance's territory appeared in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, each state will become an isolated island, unable to take care of themselves. Their strength has already been thoroughly investigated. Dividing and conquering them won't be a problem."</p><p></p><p>"The key lies in the four central states of the Immortal Alliance and the Immortal Alliance headquarters."</p><p></p><p>After scanning the roster of the main stationed cultivators in each state, Sun Erlang focused his gaze on the center of the map.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Sun Erlang said, "Master hinted at it when he summoned me before. At that time, he will use a shocking means to directly seal off the four central states and the Immortal Alliance headquarters. We probably don't need to worry about reinforcements from the Immortal Alliance headquarters and only need to focus on quickly resolving the battles in each state."</p><p></p><p>"In addition, we will use formations to seal off the Immortal Alliance's secret realms hidden in the white mist and various states before the war begins. Although the stationed forces in each of these places like the Hidden Dragon Abyss, Phoenix Mist City, Vast Mountain, and Intimidating Immortal City are not strong, they cannot be underestimated when combined. We still need to defeat them one by one."</p><p></p><p>The other disciples listened solemnly to Sun Erlang's explanation of the war plan.</p><p></p><p>Only Ou Shangtian said with a playful smile, "I have personally experienced the level of the Immortal Alliance's formations. They are not worth mentioning at all. The sealing formations personally created by Master can easily trap them for a year or two!"</p><p></p><p>"It's just that the formation materials might be a bit scarce?" Ou Shangtian suddenly frowned and asked in puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang smiled and took out a piece of [Void Clarity Stone Matrix], placing it in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>Ou Shangtian glanced at the resources loaded inside the stone matrix and was so shocked that he stood up, "So much? Did you steal the Immortal Alliance's treasure vault?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang laughed, "Master gave me a total of three pieces. Each stone matrix is filled to the brim. As far as I know, Senior Ou Daozi also has ample resources bestowed upon him. So you don't need to worry about strategic materials. Just focus on the formation preparations."</p><p></p><p>Hearing about his father, Ou Shangtian's eyes lit up and he nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang then looked at Su Yuqing and Liuli, who had been silent the whole time.</p><p></p><p>Ever since they were sent by the Sacred Emperor to guard the underground dark world, it was as if they had been tainted by the darkness and their personalities had changed, becoming much more silent and reticent.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister, how is the organization of the reinforcements from the small worlds going?" Sun Erlang asked.</p><p></p><p>"Faster than expected. Rest assured, the alliance army from the myriad realms will arrive at the battlefield on time," Su Yuqing said softly, with a firmness in her tone that she didn't possess before.</p><p></p><p>During the process of enlightening the dark tribes in the underground dark world, she vaguely comprehended the possible connection between the Dao of the small worlds and the existence of the people within the realms.</p><p></p><p>In addition, her experience of being favored and possessed by the Dao during her departure from the realm made her naturally easier to gain the affinity of the Dao of the small worlds compared to other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Relying on this advantage, she traveled between different small worlds on the orders of the Sacred Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Using both soft and hard methods, temptation and coercion, she employed a two-pronged approach.</p><p></p><p>Although she didn't have high expectations for the actual combat power that this alliance army could truly display when the time came, it would definitely be sufficient to boost morale.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial thing was to eliminate the possibility of them causing trouble when the Sacred Dynasty and the Immortal Alliance fought their decisive battle.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, where did Senior Sister Lin Ling go? Why haven't I seen her recently?" Ou Shangtian suddenly asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang was vague, "She has her own mission from Master, and I'm not too clear about it. But don't worry, she will definitely not miss this feast."</p><p></p><p>The disciples once again looked at the map of the Immortal Alliance in the center of the room.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes showed a hint of impatience.</p><p></p><p>In the testing grounds, or rather the academy, built for Yin Shangren in the secret realm of the Sacred Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren scratched his scalp and pressed the true self Dao foundation that had emerged from the crack in his skull back in again.</p><p></p><p>He said uncertainly, "Isn't this too hasty?"</p><p></p><p>"With my Foundation Establishment method, it can be considered a complete victory. The Mixed Element Golden Core has only been derived halfway. As for the later stages, they are all castles in the air and illusions. They look very wonderful at first glance, but they fall apart with a single poke and can't withstand scrutiny!"</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Emperor Li Ping was sitting at a wooden table, occasionally flipping through illusory texts and making revisions.</p><p></p><p>Around him, the phenomenon resembling a starry river born from his Dao comprehension twisted space and appeared and disappeared from time to time.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren forcibly shifted his gaze away from such an astonishing scene.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the Sacred Emperor finished reading through the entire illusory book and started revising from the first page again.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he respond, "As the saying goes, [When the real acts as the fake, the fake is also real]. As long as we make the cultivators of the world believe that this is a [New New Method] that can break free from the traditional cultivation system and be practiced independently..."</p><p></p><p>"Even if it only lasts for a few days, that will be enough."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, with the New New Method being so abstruse and completely contradictory to the traditional methods, how long do you think it will take for the cultivators of the Profound Yellow Realm to verify its authenticity?"</p><p></p><p>As the Sacred Emperor spoke, he once again used his hand as a pen to revise the illusory book constructed by the New New Method.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren didn't answer, only repeating the phrase [When the real acts as the fake, the fake is also real] in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he had a sudden realization, "I see. It's precisely because there was no New New Method in the world before, so once we announce it and the Foundation Establishment method that is easiest to verify is real, they will naturally assume for the time being that the subsequent techniques are all real as well."</p><p></p><p>"And my repeated revisions are just to make this deception effect a little better," the Sacred Emperor said with a self-deprecating smile.</p><p></p><p>"But what's the point? In the end, it's impossible to shake the foundation of the traditional methods," Yin Shangren scratched his scalp again.</p><p></p><p>"The traditional methods and the New New Method are incompatible. To cultivate, one has to change sects and re-establish their Dao path. Those who choose to do so may be one in a thousand, but after all, one side wanes as the other waxes."</p><p></p><p>"More importantly..."</p><p></p><p>As the Sacred Emperor spoke, he once again completed a round of revisions to the illusory book.</p><p></p><p>He didn't make any further changes, but closed the illusory book.</p><p></p><p>Pressing his hands on it, a dazzling starlight surged over the book.</p><p></p><p>In just a breath's time, the originally purely fictitious illusory book actually gained a physical form.</p><p></p><p>It became a [book] that truly existed in the world.</p><p></p><p>Handing this [New New Method] book to Yin Shangren, the Sacred Emperor stood up and continued, "More importantly, if we announce the New New Method and the Immortal Alliance can't do anything to us..."</p><p></p><p>"The Dao of Transmission will definitely rush back from the distant starry sky."</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Emperor said in a solemn voice.</p><p></p><p>"This is called attacking where the enemy must rush to defend."</p><p></p><p>A glimmer flashed in Yin Shangren's eyes as he slowly nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Do you... have confidence in facing the Dao of Transmission?" Yin Shangren hesitated for a moment but still asked.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a desperate fight," the Sacred Emperor paused and said frankly.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 954</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The following is the full English translation of the provided Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Those gods and demons were the embodiment of Li Fan's thoughts, deeply rooted in his consciousness the moment he perfected the "Divine Possession" technique.</p><p></p><p>Every move, every emotion and thought, was under Li Fan's control.</p><p></p><p>How could he escape by simply "not using" it?</p><p></p><p>"It's normal to have some ulterior motives, as long as they can be used for my purposes. The way of the beasts, for now, still seems to have endless potential."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't care about the Empire and others' two-faced behavior, as they couldn't escape from his grasp anyway.</p><p></p><p>To test the effect of the "Heavenly Furnace", Li Fan returned to the Spirit Wood Realm and directly came to the Beast Realm through a spatial passage.</p><p></p><p>He placed one of the finished products on the mountain peak and set up a protective formation around it.</p><p></p><p>Then he left a thread of divine sense to observe the changes caused by the Heavenly Furnace.</p><p></p><p>The formation was only to prevent the beasts from damaging the furnace and would not affect the spread of the spiritual energy generated.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the high concentration of spiritual energy around this strange device on the mountain peak attracted the attention of the beasts on the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Although the vast majority were the lowest-level beasts that had not yet developed intelligence, their innate sensitivity to spiritual energy still made them swarm and crowd in front of the Heavenly Furnace, greedily trying to absorb the pure spiritual energy as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Without cultivation methods, they could not actively absorb the spiritual energy into their bodies. The vast majority of the spiritual energy still dispersed into the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>After ten days, this originally inconspicuous small mountain suddenly became vibrant.</p><p></p><p>"At this rate, to transform a small world without spiritual energy into a small world that meets the minimum requirements for cultivation, it would require about one hundred Heavenly Furnaces and a hundred years of continuous operation."</p><p></p><p>"If there were ten thousand, it could be done in one year!"</p><p></p><p>Having obtained the general data, Li Fan immediately summoned the Tree People.</p><p></p><p>As the Spirit Wood Realm continued to upgrade and with the nourishment from Lin Ling's advancement in cultivation, the strength of the Tree People's female chief also increased day by day.</p><p></p><p>Now she had reached the late stage of the Demigod realm, only one step away from the Dao Integration realm.</p><p></p><p>Among the Tree People, those with Yuan Ying battle strength were also emerging one after another.</p><p></p><p>The overall strength of the tribe had made a qualitative leap compared to when Li Fan first took over the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Tree People all worshipped Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The female chief came before Li Fan, knelt down on one knee, kowtowed and said, "Greetings, Venerable One!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan placed a Heavenly Furnace in front of the female chief and explained in detail the method of forging it.</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, use the strength of your entire tribe to refine this object."</p><p></p><p>"Within three years, I want those small worlds connected to the Spirit Wood Realm to all become suitable for cultivation."</p><p></p><p>The female chief immediately accepted the order and left.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, seeing the Tree People already busy at work, Li Fan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>The tireless Tree People were the most suitable for this kind of work.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the continuous improvement of the "Array Refinement" progress, the entire Spirit Wood Realm was now under Li Fan's complete control.</p><p></p><p>A single thought could determine their life and death, and there was no risk of losing control.</p><p></p><p>He felt that refining the "Heavenly Furnace" and then arranging them in every corner of the small worlds was very much like planting trees and afforestation.</p><p></p><p>It was extremely interesting.</p><p></p><p>With the help of Tian Yang, Li Fan had even less to worry about.</p><p></p><p>The formation derived from the Doomsday Dissociation Disc, specially used to protect and connect all the "Heavenly Furnaces", was transmitted...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After handing over the responsibility to Tian Yang, Li Fan simply became a hands-off shopkeeper.</p><p></p><p>Back then, Tian Yang was able to use the Earth Fire Returning to Origin Formation to refine his own puppet body. His attainment in formations was already quite impressive.</p><p></p><p>During this period, as his mind became increasingly clear, and under Li Fan's personal guidance, he quickly mastered this formation completely.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan let Tian Yang name this formation. Tian Yang showed a silly smile.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for seven whole days and nights, he finally came up with a good name: [Heaven and Earth Myriad Spirits Grand Formation].</p><p></p><p>The Heaven and Earth Myriad Spirits Formation could use all the arranged Heaven and Earth Furnaces as nodes to form a spiritual power network that spanned the small world.</p><p></p><p>Once the grand formation took shape, even if a certain node was damaged, the missing spiritual energy could be replenished through this spiritual power network without causing a decrease in the overall spiritual energy concentration.</p><p></p><p>In addition to spreading spiritual energy, this spiritual power network also had many functions such as surveillance, attack, and defense.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's vision, the ultimate form of the Heaven and Earth Myriad Spirits Formation should be one level higher than the [Profound Net], capable of self-creation and derivation, the ultimate creation of the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, it's only smaller in scale now, but in essence, it's already very close."</p><p></p><p>"However, it still needs a derivation and coordination core, such as the Heavenly Profound Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"Only the Heavenly Profound Mirror can support the envisioned scale of the Heaven and Earth Myriad Spirits Formation. Apart from that, even my Ultimate Dissociation Disk can't do it."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts surged, and he couldn't calm down for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an inexplicable uneasiness disrupted his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression changed slightly, and his figure flashed, directly leaving the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Not long after arriving in the Xuanhuang Realm, Heavenly Doctor's voice rang out in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Finally found you."</p><p></p><p>"I sensed that the seal on the Cloud Water Heavenly Palace has loosened. To prevent outsiders from disturbing it, go and reinforce the seal."</p><p></p><p>As Heavenly Doctor finished speaking, a prohibition called [Hidden World Concealed Void] appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Doctor seemed to be very busy.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Li Fan's response, he disappeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Anchored for 11 years, Cloud Water Heavenly Palace opens."</p><p></p><p>"I almost forgot about this matter."</p><p></p><p>"But what does Heavenly Doctor mean by this errand? Is it a test or something else?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan wasn't too surprised that Heavenly Doctor could directly locate and contact him.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had met him face to face in this world and accepted the [Patching Heaven Record] transmitted by him.</p><p></p><p>This was the price that needed to be paid for direct contact with Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>However, feeling such a lack of security still made Li Fan somewhat unhappy.</p><p></p><p>Without much consideration, Li Fan cupped his hands towards the sky, and then headed towards the Congyu Sea.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the center of the Congyu Sea, where the Cloud Water Heavenly Palace was located.</p><p></p><p>At this time, although the Cloud Water Heavenly Palace had not yet officially appeared in the world, there were already some anomalies appearing in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Attracting passing cultivators to stop and watch from time to time.</p><p></p><p>Using the prohibition passed by Heavenly Doctor, Li Fan entered the interior silently.</p><p></p><p>He was on guard against entering the illusion realm of Senior Brother Qin Tang, but unexpectedly, he directly appeared in front of the main entrance of the Cloud Water Heavenly Palace.</p><p></p><p>He did not enter Senior Brother Qin's illusion test.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, the stone statue transformed by Qin Tang stood silently, as if unchanged since ancient times.</p><p></p><p>The entire Cloud Water Heavenly Palace was also completely silent.</p><p></p><p>As if all the strangeness within it was in a state of slumber.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Li Fan had seen the Cloud Water Heavenly Palace in its sealed state. Compared to the state he had seen before.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Cloud Water Heavenly Palace gave Li Fan the feeling of just an ordinary sect where cultivators were resting.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 759</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>White Xu did not respond. He simply pointed to the "Terminal Disk" on top of his head and calmly asked, "Do your Five Elders Council need this thing?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu was stunned for a moment, then couldn't help but nod repeatedly. </p><p>"Before coming here, the organization had already instructed me. A fair trade - one Terminal Disk in exchange for one Genuine Temptation Fruit," White Xu said with his head raised.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu nodded slightly, not feeling that White Xu was asking for too much. He even thought this trade was greatly in favor of their Five Elders Council.</p><p>He looked at the Terminal Disk with some greed in his eyes and said, "There shouldn't be any problem. But I still need to report back and confirm with my superiors."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, White Xu handed over another Terminal Disk, "You can take this object with you first. Out there are the eyes of the Celestial Mirror everywhere. It would be troublesome if you accidentally exposed it."</p><p>At the same time, White Xu explained in detail how to use the Terminal Disk.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu's eyes flickered with strange lights, and he also felt some gratitude towards White Xu, "You are indeed considerate, friend. In this difficult situation, our two forces should join hands to overcome the crisis together."</p><p></p><p>White Xu waved his hand, "You go ahead. Go quickly and come back quickly, I'll wait for you here."</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu nodded and disappeared in a flash of light.</p><p>It took only half an hour before he hurriedly returned.</p><p>"The higher-ups have agreed to the trade with you. But there is one issue - how many of these 'Sky-Covering Disks' can your Overarching Heaven Sect provide?" Liu Wenyu asked.</p><p></p><p>"This object is not easy to refine, and our organization does not have enough either," White Xu said in a deep voice.</p><p>This was within Liu Wenyu's expectations, but White Xu's next words made his heart shake violently.</p><p></p><p>"At most, we can probably only give you a few hundred of them," White Xu sighed, sounding somewhat helpless.</p><p></p><p>"So many?!" Liu Wenyu exclaimed in astonishment.</p><p>Instantly, a feeling of regret welled up in his heart.</p><p>He realized that these "Sky-Covering Disks" might not be as precious as he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>"Too many? Then let's change it to one hundred instead. If your Five Elders Council doesn't want them, there are plenty of cultivators who do," White Xu snorted coldly and said bluntly.</p><p></p><p>"When I said a few hundred, of course I meant they would be delivered in batches. Did you think this thing grows like weeds, just needing some water to sprout?"</p><p></p><p>"Not too many, not too many," Liu Wenyu said repeatedly.</p><p>"However, we don't have that large a stockpile of 'Genuine Temptation Fruits'..." Liu Wenyu said with some difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"Then it's the same as before, any valuable resources will do," White Xu waved his hand. "In fact, our Overarching Heaven Sect can lend you a batch of Sky-Covering Disks first, that's also possible."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that the organization believes we may need to further strengthen our cooperation," White Xu said somewhat sternly.</p><p></p><p>"Deepen cooperation?" Liu Wenyu frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Ever since the Myriad Immortal Alliance established the Reincarnation Ministry and the Celestial Mirror acted strangely, the great situation has rapidly deteriorated. If the Reincarnation Celestial Lord's regression has indeed become irreversible, there's nothing we can do about it.</p><p></p><p>But facing the Celestial Mirror scanning the myriad minor worlds and trying to upgrade itself, are you in the Five Elders Council really going to remain indifferent...?"</p><p></p><p>"With five Celestial Lords present, surely you must have some countermeasures, no?" White Xu asked in great dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly are you all doing?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu wanted to speak but held back.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps this trading opportunity can be used to get some clarification..."</p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese text you provided:</p><p></p><p>The man's expression was indecipherable as he said, "The situation is urgent, the sooner the transaction the better. Three days from now, outside Tianliang City, in the depths of Mount Wuliang."</p><p></p><p>After arranging the meeting location, Liu Wenyu prepared to take his leave.</p><p></p><p>"Don't forget to include that Heavenly Covering Disc I gave you earlier in the transaction list," Xu Bai said, causing Liu Wenyu's steps to falter slightly before he quickened his pace.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Xu Bai also slowly walked out of the room, vanishing like a wisp of smoke to an unknown destination.</p><p></p><p>Mount Wuliang. </p><p></p><p>Ever since the incident where the Wuliang Wall had devoured cultivators, this place that was originally sparsely populated had become even more desolate.</p><p></p><p>Not many cultivators understood the true nature of the Wuliang Wall's enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, most cultivators were now focused on conquering small worlds to accumulate merit.</p><p></p><p>As a result, very few cultivators dared to venture here. After all, if one were to be devoured by the Wuliang Wall, there was no guarantee of resurrection.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai quietly arrived at the bottom of the Wuliang Valley, gazing at the smooth, mirror-like Wuliang Wall as he waited patiently.</p><p></p><p>"I heard it was you who managed to rescue that nephew of Guan Changge from the Wuliang Wall last time?" suddenly a voice sounded from behind Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai was startled and turned around, only to see a middle-aged cultivator in a purple-gold Taoist robe, who had seemingly appeared out of nowhere beside him. The man was silently observing the Wuliang Wall, not looking at Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>But it was clear that the one who had just spoken was this purple-robed cultivator. Xu Bai's heart grew heavy.</p><p></p><p>Although the other party had deliberately concealed his aura, the fact that Xu Bai could not even sense his presence at all was enough to judge the other's true cultivation.</p><p></p><p>A Transcendent Immortal Venerable!</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Senior, it was by sheer luck that I managed to rescue Guan Changge," Xu Bai replied respectfully.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, his mind raced, guessing the other's identity.</p><p></p><p>Given the time and location, this could not be a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>"Could he be the contact person for the Five Elders' transaction this time?" Xu Bai couldn't help but speculate.</p><p></p><p>"The Transcendent Immortal Venerable is actually a spy for the Five Elders..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the identity of this purple-robed cultivator became clear.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Celestial Venerable, the overall commander of the Myriad Immortal Alliance's Martial Arts Hall.</p><p></p><p>Even though Xu Bai had already known about his spy identity from his previous lives, seeing the Purple Celestial Venerable suddenly appear before him still caught him by surprise.</p><p></p><p>Without revealing his own identity first, Xu Bai tentatively asked, "I wonder, Senior..."</p><p></p><p>"I am here representing the Five Elders to conduct a transaction with your Heavenly Cover Sect," the Purple Celestial Venerable interrupted, surprising Xu Bai by speaking so openly.</p><p></p><p>This left Xu Bai momentarily silent, unsure of the other's intentions and pondering his countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, this was only his spiritual projection, so Xu Bai was not too anxious.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you have recognized my identity. How interesting. I have been stationed at the Martial Arts Hall headquarters for many years and have not ventured out much," the Purple Celestial Venerable said with a slight smile, glancing at Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>"Senior is too kind. I was merely startled upon suddenly learning of your true identity. I don't know what else to say," Xu Bai replied, bowing respectfully and appearing quite nervous.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1299</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"They all got away? What are you all doing here!"</p><p></p><p>"These cultivators were too fast! Their movements were coordinated and well-trained, not at all like a ragtag group."</p><p></p><p>"It's not that they were fast, they vanished into thin air right in front of us!"</p><p></p><p>A video was spreading through the Stellar Network of the Holy Dynasty. </p><p></p><p>Just as the group of attackers was about to be caught by the Holy Dynasty soldiers, they turned into nothingness at the critical moment and dissipated into the air.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Dynasty soldiers thought the other party had teleported away and wanted to continue tracking them.</p><p></p><p>But they couldn't find any traces of spatial fluctuations at all.</p><p></p><p>"Requesting support. The current number of soldiers in Luoyan Province is barely enough to maintain the defense of the Heavenly City. We don't have the strength to pursue and eliminate the remaining Immortal Alliance forces within the territory."</p><p></p><p>"On our side in Shilin Province, we have completely eliminated all resistance forces. We can rush over there!"</p><p></p><p>"We're almost done too! Brothers, hold on!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang looked at the internal communications from the Eastern Battlefield, considering whether to dispatch another portion of troops to jointly surround and annihilate Luoyan Province.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, as if a lightning bolt flashed in his mind, Sun Erlang's heart jumped.</p><p></p><p>And then a sense of doubt surged up.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly remembered something his master had said before.</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right. Luoyan Province should have been destroyed once already. Although the Myriad Immortal Alliance later rebuilt Luoyan Province, there's no way there could be so many cultivators defending it..."</p><p></p><p>"How could I have forgotten such an important matter?"</p><p></p><p>A glint flashed through Sun Erlang's eyes. He had already sensed something was amiss and immediately issued an order to all the Holy Dynasty soldiers: "Suspend all support to Luoyan Province. I will personally send people to resolve it."</p><p></p><p>"The 36th Army Corps responsible for guarding Luoyan Province should also withdraw as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Military orders are like mountains.</p><p></p><p>No one questioned it and quickly executed the orders.</p><p></p><p>"I am Lan Xiangwen, commander of the 36th Army Corps of the First Army. I have led my troops to complete the withdrawal. According to orders, we have retreated to Lueying Province."</p><p></p><p>"But... I didn't see any of our people here."</p><p></p><p>"Lan Xiangwen, what nonsense are you talking about? We've been waiting for you at the agreed location, and we haven't seen a single hair of you! Where exactly are you!"</p><p></p><p>"No, Lan Xiangwen, your location shows that you're still within the Luoyan Province! What are you and the 36th Army Corps doing?!"</p><p></p><p>Some confusion began to appear in the internal communications of the Eastern Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba, the overall commander of the Eastern Battlefield, decisively isolated the communications of this group and began to question them in detail.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Sun Erlang's voice also came through.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanba, there's something strange about this place. I can confirm that after the entire 36th Army Corps entered Luoyan Province, their position has never changed. It's as if they've fallen into a deep sleep."</p><p></p><p>"So don't believe any of the information they report. It should be hallucinations in their dreams."</p><p></p><p>Wang Xuanba was slightly surprised: "I've already sent a beast body to infiltrate, but I couldn't find them. But I really didn't expect it to be hallucinations."</p><p></p><p>"One of my puppet bodies has already reached the interior of Luoyan Province..."</p><p></p><p>The scene of Luoyan Province was transmitted to Sun Erlang's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The location of Wang Xuanba's beast body sensed by the Stellar Sea showed no sign of people.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there was no sign of battle anywhere in Luoyan Province.</p><p></p><p>It was peaceful and calm.</p><p></p><p>"Even puppet bodies can be dragged into the illusory realm?" Sun Erlang felt a bit of heaviness in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that the fake is destined to never become real!"</p><p></p><p>The puppet with alternating black and gold patterns extended its arms forward.</p><p></p><p>A long bow made of pure golden energy instantly appeared in its fingers as the puppet body's energy surged.</p><p></p><p>The bow was bent like a crescent moon, and a silver arrow appeared along with it.</p><p></p><p>After a brief moment of charging, the silver radiance pierced through the sky like a dragon.</p><p></p><p>The vast energy shattered the space in front, about to reveal the truth beneath the illusory facade.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a somewhat pale hand stretched out from the void without any warning.</p><p></p><p>It lightly grasped the Heaven-Traversing Arrow.</p><p></p><p>No matter how much the silver light on the arrow's body erupted, it was always firmly grasped and unable to move.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the light was completely extinguished, and the arrow turned into an ordinary one in that hand.</p><p></p><p>The space previously pierced by the Heaven-Traversing Arrow also restored itself.</p><p></p><p>The pale arm that blocked the Heaven-Traversing Arrow, just like the puppet controlled by Sun Erlang, also gradually became dim and illusory.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>Mysterious golden energy surged from within the puppet body.</p><p></p><p>"Poof!"</p><p></p><p>A pair of arms stretched out from the puppet's back.</p><p></p><p>Followed by another pair, growing out from the left side of the torso.</p><p></p><p>After a total of eight pairs, sixteen arms, had grown out, the puppet's movements finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>The golden patterns seemed to come alive, constantly circulating on the surface of the body.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>As if thunder had descended upon the world, eight long bows appeared one after another in the puppet's hands.</p><p></p><p>Bowstrings pulled taut, eight Heaven-Traversing Arrows pointed in different directions, ready to be released.</p><p></p><p>"Break through!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang let out an angry shout.</p><p></p><p>Eight silver dragons roared and howled, shooting out from the central puppet simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Gold and silver vied for brilliance, even temporarily obscuring the moonlight transformed by the Great Awakening in the sky.</p><p></p><p>It was as if only this one forceful creation existed in the world.</p><p></p><p>Wherever the eight Heaven-Traversing Arrows passed, space shattered like broken mirrors, exploding layer by layer.</p><p></p><p>But strangely, those fragments did not continue to fly outward.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they froze in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>The silver dragons still rushed forward at high speed, thoroughly smashing everything in their path.</p><p></p><p>But the places they had destroyed seemed to have fallen into a state of time freeze.</p><p></p><p>The true scene outside the illusion was thus not truly revealed.</p><p></p><p>What made Sun Erlang's pupils contract was that the pale arm appeared again.</p><p></p><p>Only this time, it did not stop the eight Heaven-Traversing Arrows.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it leisurely and swiftly picked up the frozen illusion fragments one by one and placed them back in their original positions.</p><p></p><p>If this pale arm was allowed to continue restoring, the grandiose Heaven-Traversing Arrow Dance, which could heavily injure eight Convergence Realm cultivators, would probably be like punching cotton, having no effect at all.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang naturally would not let the other party succeed.</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's just a puppet body, you haven't even shown your face from beginning to end..."</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you looking down on me a bit too much!"</p><p></p><p>The eight pairs of arms on the puppet moved around its body.</p><p></p><p>Squirming and merging, they turned into a pair of extremely thick arms almost the size of the puppet itself in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Forcefully grabbing!</p><p></p><p>However, this seemingly delicate arm actually contained an unimaginably vast amount of power.</p><p></p><p>Creak, creak...</p><p></p><p>Not only did the giant puppet arms fail to stop its movements, they were instead dragged along by the other party, forcibly continuing in the direction of its original actions.</p><p></p><p>The dark golden patterns on the puppet's body had already been pushed to their limit.</p><p></p><p>Sun Erlang even vaguely felt that in this high-intensity power confrontation, the puppet body had also reached the limit of what it could withstand.</p><p></p><p>It was about to disintegrate in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>A cold glint flashed through Sun Erlang's true body's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Remote power support from other dark gold puppets was instantly infused into it.</p><p></p><p>Under the golden light, the puppet's body instantly expanded several times over.</p><p></p><p>The suddenly increased immense power pulled back the movement of the pale arm.</p><p></p><p>Not letting the opportunity slip away, the energy erupted to its peak, wanting to drag out the true mastermind behind the scenes who had been secretly making trouble.</p><p></p><p>The idea was good, but just as Sun Erlang felt he was about to achieve it, a sense of coldness inexplicably surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Then, he felt...</p><p></p><p>As if another pale, cold arm had been placed on the puppet's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>With a slight exertion of force, the puppet's previous limit state was broken.</p><p></p><p>Its body staggered and lost balance.</p><p></p><p>Before it could even adjust, Sun Erlang felt one pale hand after another stretching out from the void.</p><p></p><p>Pressing down on the puppet's body.</p><p></p><p>The power of each hand didn't seem very strong.</p><p></p><p>But they were so firm that when combined, they pressed down on the puppet like mountains and seas.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the puppet was submerged in a pile of white hands, unable to move.</p><p></p><p>A drop of blood was left in Sun Erlang's eyes as he forcibly extricated himself from the state of controlling the puppet.</p><p></p><p>He had a premonition that if he continued to control the puppet and was dragged into that unknown place by those pale arms, his true body would also suffer extremely serious injuries.</p><p></p><p>It was no longer something he could handle. A hint of unwillingness flashed through his mind, but Sun Erlang didn't force it.</p><p></p><p>"You can step back. Leave this place to me." Fortunately, at this moment, Qiaogong's voice rang out beside the puppet's ear.</p><p></p><p>"This treasure is something I painstakingly created. I can't hand it over to you..." Qiaogong muttered, and his figure immediately appeared beside the dark gold puppet.</p><p></p><p>The rotating blade light in his hand made a simple circle on those pale arms tightly grasping the puppet.</p><p></p><p>Countless arms broke off from the wounds like torn paper.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong patted the dark gold puppet's shoulder, and the puppet gradually shrank back to its normal size.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a flash of light, it teleported away from this place.</p><p></p><p>At the last moment, Sun Erlang discovered that those half-cut pale arms severed by Qiaogong were actually just segments of willow branches.</p><p></p><p>"Willow tree?"</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong also had the same question at the same time.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to take the cut willow branches, but he grasped at nothing.</p><p></p><p>In the time he was stunned, the originally dense myriad of pale arms had once again merged into the space and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Not even willing to show your hand? You're giving me, Qiaogong, too little face."</p><p></p><p>There was no anger on Qiaogong's face, and he just took out a round copper plate from his bosom.</p><p></p><p>On the copper plate were a few small figurines in comical poses.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the figurines were frolicking, but as soon as Qiaogong took them out, they immediately became nervous and uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Pointing in different directions around them.</p><p></p><p>Without seeing Qiaogong make any movements, a rope-like shadow flew out from beside him.</p><p></p><p>It quickly flew and disappeared into the air while concealing itself.</p><p></p><p>After a while, as if colliding with something, the black rope began to sway.</p><p></p><p>Wherever the small figurines on the round plate pointed, the black shadows beside Qiaogong kept shooting out.</p><p></p><p>Before long, a strange and gloomy giant black net was constructed with Qiaogong at the center.</p><p></p><p>The small figurines seemed to have completed their mission and patted their chests in relief.</p><p></p><p>Although the small figurines were very reluctant, they had no choice. They whistled, and one figurine turned into two.</p><p></p><p>They somersaulted, and two figurines turned into four.</p><p></p><p>In no time, they went from a single figurine to an army of small figurines.</p><p></p><p>Each figurine had a bitter face as they jumped onto the black ropes.</p><p></p><p>Then, under the faintly orderly chanting, the figurines began to pull the black shadows in front of them in unison.</p><p></p><p>The huge black net instantly contracted.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding space trembled slightly, and the restored fragments shattered again.</p><p></p><p>Something was about to be pulled out from the illusory surface.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong narrowed his eyes and waited in anticipation, while muttering to himself: "If it can even pull the Immortal Puppet Ancestor, how can it not handle you?"</p><p></p><p>A sigh inexplicably rang out.</p><p></p><p>Faint sounds of a zither seemed to come from the edge of the sky.</p><p></p><p>The originally energetic small figurines instantly became listless and began to slack off one after another.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong showed a vigilant expression and surveyed the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"Why fight..."</p><p></p><p>A sorrowful and lamenting sound kept echoing around Qiaogong.</p><p></p><p>Qiaogong's eyes circled around, and then he said with a smile: "Well said! Why must we fight! I, Qiaogong, am not good at fighting..."</p><p></p><p>"Since neither of us wants to make a move, why don't we sit down and have a good talk."</p><p></p><p>To prove his sincerity, Qiaogong even directly put away the round plate.</p><p></p><p>The small figurines cheered and packed up, while Qiaogong looked around with a smile: "..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I am Qiao Gong from the Tianji Realm. May I ask for your esteemed name, fellow cultivator?" </p><p></p><p>The other party was indeed a powerful being at the Eternal Life Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, during the brief exchange with Qiao Gong, there were no traces of the reversed Profound Yellow Realm's laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Thus, he judged that the other party's identity was the same as his own - a survivor from another destroyed cultivation realm.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, that gentle and solemn voice rang out again: "I... I don't remember anymore."</p><p></p><p>"I just don't want to see any more conflicts. I mean no harm."</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong also breathed a sigh of relief in his heart. </p><p></p><p>Although he was not afraid, it was still best not to make an enemy out of a powerful being at the Eternal Life Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, we don't mean any harm either..."</p><p></p><p>Qiao Gong smiled and started chatting with the other party.</p><p></p><p>On Sun Erlang's side, upon receiving the message from Qiao Gong, he sighed slightly in his heart: "The gap between the Eternal Life Realm and the Integrated Dao Realm is indeed like the difference between heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"However, if all the Dark Gold Puppets were present at that time..."</p><p></p><p>"It might not have been impossible to fight."</p><p></p><p>If the defeat of the Holy Dynasty army in Luoyan Province was just an accident,</p><p></p><p>Then their experience in Tianling Province undoubtedly proved that the Myriad Immortal Alliance indeed had some foundation.</p><p></p><p>After the Holy Dynasty army spent a lot of effort to capture Tianling City, they were shocked to find that it was actually an empty city.</p><p></p><p>The important cultivators in the city had already completed their relocation.</p><p></p><p>Only some cultivators without any background were left behind, relying on mechanisms and magic treasures to resist.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Dynasty soldiers quickly realized that this might be a trap, but before they could retreat, the entire Tianling City exploded.</p><p></p><p>The huge floating city, along with nearly ten thousand cultivators from both sides, vanished in an instant.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, the phenomenon of falling stars burst out simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Various strange scenes intertwined and distorted, making it difficult for people to distinguish.</p><p></p><p>In a hidden mountain valley in Tianling Province,</p><p></p><p>"Thanks to Brother Sun's warning, our Tianling Province was able to turn misfortune into a blessing." Song Mansheng stroked his beard and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Sun Liancheng's gaze was still fixed on the huge fireball in the distant sky: "It still depends on the city lord's wise decision. If the city lord had not been so decisive, even if I had made a suggestion, the effect of killing the enemy would definitely not have been so good."</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators in the valley echoed: "Yes, according to the shadow projection left by our people in the city, at least more than ten thousand bandits were buried in this explosion."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, fellow cultivator, you saw it wrong. It was clearly twenty thousand!"</p><p></p><p>"...Oh, right, right. I'm getting old and confused! Twenty thousand, it is indeed twenty thousand! There are video recordings as evidence!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone tacitly agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, what exactly is the origin of these people? They attacked without any signs, and most importantly, they could even affect the teleportation array and the Tianxuan Mirror." Sun Liancheng interrupted everyone's celebration.</p><p></p><p>"Who cares about their origin, as long as the central Immortal Alliance takes action, they will all die. They are just rampant for a while now!"</p><p></p><p>"Lord Song, should we take advantage of the chaos to launch an attack and gain more merits?"</p><p></p><p>Someone in the valley suggested.</p><p></p><p>Song Mansheng pondered for a moment, did not make a decision, but looked at Sun Liancheng beside him.</p><p></p><p>Sun Liancheng narrowed his eyes and remained silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a long time, Sun Liancheng finally shook his head: "The situation is unclear, and it is difficult for me to judge."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Song Mansheng nodded: "In that case, let's wait a little longer. The situation is unclear, so it's best not to act rashly."</p><p></p><p>The crowd in the valley naturally agreed.</p><p></p><p>However, Song Mansheng and Sun Liancheng had a private conversation, avoiding the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Sun, you didn't tell the truth just now." Song Mansheng said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Sun Liancheng smiled bitterly: "I really dare not say it in front of everyone. Otherwise, I'm afraid it will shake the morale of the troops!"</p><p></p><p>Song Mansheng's expression turned solemn: "Is it that serious?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Liancheng said: "Yes. You also know that this time I was able to predict the sudden attack of the bandits, all thanks to the response of our Sun family's fortune. That day, I was chatting with my nephew, but suddenly felt that the family's fortune was like a dying candle in the wind, shaking and about to fall..."</p><p></p><p>"In extreme panic, I spent a lot of effort to finally determine that the cause was not from the Immortal Alliance, but from an external source. I originally thought it would be a surprise attack from the Five Elders Society, but I didn't expect it to be a group of unknown bandits."</p><p></p><p>"During this period, the future fortune of the family has been swinging back and forth. One moment it shows the signs of wealth and nobility, and the next moment it shows the omen of the family's bloodline being cut off. It really makes people tremble with fear..." Sun Liancheng sighed.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Song Mansheng's brows furrowed even more tightly.</p><p></p><p>Sun Liancheng advised: "No matter what, with the merit of blowing up the city, when it comes to rewarding merits in the future, it will definitely not lack the city lord's contribution. The merits are already more than enough, so why take the risk again? I think the other party's reinforcements will arrive soon, and the combat power of those bandits is not low. Rather than taking risks, it's better to hide deep in this mountain valley."</p><p></p><p>"With the concealment of the natural grand formation, the other party should not be able to detect it..."</p><p></p><p>Song Mansheng was finally persuaded and suppressed the idea that was stirring in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Sun Liancheng's judgment seemed to be extremely correct.</p><p></p><p>In just half a day, Song Mansheng saw a large number of bandits swarming in.</p><p></p><p>Their faces were full of anger, and they carefully searched every corner of Tianling Province.</p><p></p><p>When they flew over the mountain valley together, everyone's hearts in the valley stopped abruptly.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, luck was ultimately on their side, and they were not exposed.</p><p></p><p>"How come we only see the reinforcements of the other party, where are the people from our Myriad Immortal Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>In the valley, everyone was nervous and whispering from time to time, looking up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>They no longer had the previous ease and comfort.</p><p></p><p>However, Sun Qi from the Sun family quietly came to Sun Liancheng's side.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, something is wrong."</p><p></p><p>Sun Liancheng was startled, and then looked around very vigilantly. After making sure that no one was paying attention, he communicated with Sun Qi through voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>"The swinging family fortune has begun to stabilize on one side. If we continue to stay here, I'm afraid there will only be a dead end."</p><p></p><p>Sun Liancheng's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>He still had great faith in the words of his nephew.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely by relying on his mysterious premonition that they had set up an ambush, detonated the Heavenly City, and wiped out a large wave of bandits.</p><p></p><p>Within the universe, branches spread and leaves scatter, people disperse and families decline.</p><p></p><p>And the Inverse Derivation Qiankun Record cultivated by Sun Qi could reverse this trend, making the family's fortune more and more concentrated.</p><p></p><p>The price was that the more prosperous the family was, the more the accumulated forces of decline would be concentrated on the cultivator of the technique.</p><p></p><p>Every breakthrough in the realm was as difficult as ascending to the heavens. Only a heaven-defying talent could break through.</p><p></p><p>Sun Qi was such a genius.</p><p></p><p>"We will relocate immediately." Sun Liancheng made a very decisive decision.</p><p></p><p>"Now everyone is watching, how can we leave? And there are so many people in our Sun family." Sun Qi was a little uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"I have long been prepared." Sun Liancheng said very confidently.</p><p></p><p>In the mountain valley, the Sun family members gathered quietly.</p><p></p><p>However, in the eyes of everyone, they did not leave. They still stayed in place and talked with them.</p><p></p><p>"This Golden Cicada Molting secret treasure was something I obtained when I was young and adventuring. I have always been reluctant to use it, but now it's time to take it out." Sun Liancheng sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Sun family members had already quietly left through a secret passage in the valley that only Sun Liancheng knew about, without the people in the valley noticing.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry, the secret treasure's concealment of aura won't last long. Let's find another place to hide." Sun Liancheng urged.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were retreating, several white lights tore through the sky and came from afar.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom!</p><p></p><p>The white lights hit the target, and an unimaginable terrifying energy exploded from the valley.</p><p></p><p>In the roar of the earth, the shockwave swept across immediately.</p><p></p><p>It blew the fleeing Sun family members head over heels.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the concealment function of the secret treasure was still effective, so they were not exposed.</p><p></p><p>Sun Liancheng and Sun Qi looked at the valley that had turned into a circular void giant pit with horrified expressions, their bodies stiff and their minds blank.</p><p></p><p>"Integrated Dao attack! The explosion just now definitely had the power of a full-strength strike from an Integrated Dao powerhouse!"</p><p></p><p>"Those were... arrows?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Sun Liancheng was dumbfounded, he was horrified to find that several more white arrow lights were whistling through the sky.</p><p></p><p>His head subconsciously shrank, and after discovering that the arrow lights were not coming towards him, he hurriedly led the Sun family members to rush to the next planned hiding place.</p><p></p><p>"No, the entire Tianling Province is no longer safe. It's not suitable to stay for long, we need to find another place to take refuge."</p><p></p><p>Halfway through the trembling journey, Sun Liancheng suddenly had an epiphany and temporarily changed the route.</p><p></p><p>He frantically fled towards Shanteng Province, which bordered Tianling Province.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to reach the border's white fog barrier, the ground of Tianling Province suddenly began to shake violently.</p><p></p><p>Then, a terrifying scene occurred that the Sun family members would never forget for the rest of their lives.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, five circular rings interlocked with each other, transforming from virtual to real, descending into the world.</p><p></p><p>From the five rings, countless tentacles stretched out towards Tianling Province below.</p><p></p><p>And one of them was flying towards the Sun family members.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!" Sun Qi's face changed drastically, and he quickly shouted.</p><p></p><p>However, Sun Liancheng had already taken a step ahead.</p><p></p><p>No longer caring about the family.</p><p></p><p>He alone turned into a blood light and flew rapidly towards the white fog barrier not far away.</p><p></p><p>But this escape technique of burning the soul actually slowed down at a visible speed. It was as if there were countless tiny tentacles in the air around him, dragging and hindering him.</p><p></p><p>The blood light dissipated, and Sun Liancheng revealed his original form.</p><p></p><p>The black wriggling tentacles in the sky quickly locked onto him.</p><p></p><p>They fiercely inserted into Sun Liancheng's body.</p><p></p><p>Sun Liancheng panicked and wanted to use techniques to resist, but the spiritual energy around him seemed to be frozen and did not obey his commands at all.</p><p></p><p>Unable to resist at all, the black tentacles quickly penetrated through Sun Liancheng.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the miserable screams of the Sun family members, they were also caught by the tentacles that had split from the sky.</p><p></p><p>The wails only lasted for a while before Sun Liancheng's body was assimilated into the same black tentacles.</p><p></p><p>There was not even a falling star phenomenon in the sky.</p><p></p><p>It was as if Sun Liancheng did not die, but merely turned into those black tentacles.</p><p></p><p>The Sun family members were captured one by one, and only Sun Qi felt a chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Not daring to move.</p><p></p><p>Yes, in the entire Sun family, only Sun Qi escaped unscathed.</p><p></p><p>Because at the moment when he was locked onto by those terrifying tentacles, Sun Qi vaguely felt in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Among the myriad dead ends, he found the only shining possible way out.</p><p></p><p>So without any hesitation, he directly used the Transformation Chapter of the Supreme Primordial True Scripture to disperse his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>And he expelled all the spiritual power stored in his body.</p><p></p><p>Without any reservation, he thoroughly became an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>A black tentacle as thick as an arm slowly floated in front of Sun Qi.</p><p></p><p>As if possessing intelligence, it circled around Sun Qi.</p><p></p><p>Only by being so close could Sun Qi see clearly that these black tentacles were actually composed of countless densely packed black insects.</p><p></p><p>Not even daring to breathe, Sun Qi's whole body was stiff.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, after judging that Sun Qi was purely an ordinary person without cultivation, the black tentacle let him go.</p><p></p><p>Taking the entire Sun family, who had also turned into black flying insects, it left with a howl.</p><p></p><p>Sun Qi, on the other hand, still maintained his original stiff posture, not daring to move.</p><p></p><p>It was not until half a day later that his whole body went limp and he fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell is this thing..."</p><p></p><p>Thousands of thoughts flashed through his mind, and it took a while before he became a little more energized.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the white fog barrier not far away, and the five circular rings gradually disappearing in the sky,</p><p></p><p>Sun Qi gritted his teeth and began cultivating again.</p><p></p><p>Not long after closing his eyes to cultivate, Sun Qi opened his eyes again.</p><p></p><p>He keenly noticed that the spiritual energy between heaven and earth...</p><p></p><p>was different from before.</p>

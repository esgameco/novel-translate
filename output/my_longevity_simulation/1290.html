            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1285 - Transmitting the Dao at Fifty Years Old (7K words)</p><p></p><p>The vortex in the sky was about to heal. üë∫‚úä‚ûÖ‚ùæ≈ûÔº®·ëå·ô≠.·ëïœåùìúüéÄüëå The Holy Emperor reached out and grasped the last beam of starlight shooting out from it. </p><p></p><p>The nebula flowed and glowed brightly. After being tempered in the Holy Emperor's palm, it flowed down like gentle water.</p><p></p><p>It transformed into a starlight throne.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor sat upright and spoke slowly with a voice like thunder: "Primordial chaos, the limitless beginning; Yin and Yang divided, the Five Elements circulated; All things emerged, created by the Supreme One..."</p><p></p><p>Every word and phrase was extremely profound and abstruse.</p><p></p><p>But as the Holy Emperor recited, the living beings in this world who had the fortune to listen all vaguely felt a sense of contemplation.</p><p></p><p>The fleeting enlightenment that was produced from being enveloped by the starlight overhead became clear again in the Holy Emperor's majestic voice expounding the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao follows the ways of Heaven and Earth, grasping it makes one an Immortal; Wandering freely in the azure void, driving the forces of creation; Imperishable through myriad kalpas, Qi nurturing the Eight Wastelands..."</p><p></p><p>Even those with ordinary aptitude and low cultivation had some realization in the Holy Emperor's voice. </p><p></p><p>The surrounding spiritual Qi spontaneously poured into their bodies, presenting the appearance of enlightenment on the spot.</p><p></p><p>As for those with exceptional talent like Sun Erlang and Ou Shangtian, their eyes shone brightly, and even wisps of purple Qi were attracted to surround them.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren scratched his scalp. He felt the foundation of his Dao of Self was almost impatiently trying to burst out.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the saying 'when one person attains the Dao, even his pets ascend to heaven'? No, this is clearly selflessly sharing one's own realizations with others regardless of closeness. Tsk..."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's Dao transmission lasted for three whole days and nights.</p><p></p><p>Those enlightened were also enraptured listening to it.</p><p></p><p>Even after the Holy Emperor's image dissipated, they were still immersed in it, unaware of anything else.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of them would need their entire remaining lives to digest the Holy Emperor's teachings.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Holy Emperor had already returned to the Holy Emperor's Seat.</p><p></p><p>The six disciples lined up in order.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to Master for enlightening to the Dao!" Sun Erlang bowed and said.</p><p></p><p>The other disciples all did the same.</p><p></p><p>"This is your Master's fortune, and also your fortune."</p><p></p><p>"Three years."</p><p></p><p>"Your Master gives you three years to comprehend it. Three years from now on this day..."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's gaze swept over the six disciples below: "Our Holy Dynasty will begin its grand opening and conquer the Myriad Immortal Alliance to take back the Xuanhuang Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The six disciples trembled upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>They had long known that this battle would inevitably come. But none of them expected that this day would arrive so quickly!</p><p></p><p>However, at this juncture, no one dared to question the great Holy Emperor's decision.</p><p></p><p>They all lowered their heads and acknowledged the order.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emperor's voice echoed in everyone's hearts.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang Realm, Tianquan Province.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan was talking eloquently at a gathering, but suddenly sensed something and quickly ended his long speech prematurely.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of everyone's inattention, he hurriedly left the cave abode.</p><p></p><p>"The [Hidden Needle Plan] is finally being implemented? We have waited far too long for this day." A glint flashed through Sun Luyuan's eyes. Suppressing the excitement in his heart and some fear of the future, he concealed his aura and rushed towards the agreed meeting place.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Hidden Needle Plan was a plan to destroy the Myriad Immortal Alliance's Tianxuan Mirrors and transmission formations.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Immortal Alliance controlled most of the Xuanhuang Realm's provinces, and could still command them as easily as moving an arm, precisely because of the existence of the Tianxuan Mirrors and transmission formations spread across the provinces.</p><p></p><p>No matter which province encountered a change, reinforcements from other provinces and even the Alliance headquarters could quickly arrive.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, to deal with the Myriad Immortal Alliance, disabling or interfering with this connection became a top priority.</p><p></p><p>"That Ou Shangtian kid said before that he could affect or even destroy the Tianxuan Sub-Mirrors in each province. I wonder what method he will actually use. But the death warriors in each of my provinces are already prepared." Sun Luyuan pondered as he hurried along.</p><p></p><p>He knew that once the bow was drawn, there was no turning back. This time, once they took action, they would completely confirm their status as traitors to the Myriad Immortal Alliance. If discovered, there would be no chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>But Sun Luyuan had already made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the previous reasons that caused him to defect, the bigger factor was the recent demise of Sun Luchang.</p><p></p><p>When Sun Luchang was selected to go outside the Xuanhuang Realm, Sun Luyuan still had a sliver of hope for his survival.</p><p></p><p>It was only when the mass of essence blood left in the underground blood pool suddenly withered that Sun Luyuan's heart turned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>These days, he watched the Myriad Immortal Alliance still periodically release rainbow light messages about leaving the realm, some of which even showed the already perished Sun Luchang.</p><p></p><p>The anger in his heart accumulated more and more.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan had been waiting for the Myriad Immortal Alliance to give him an explanation.</p><p></p><p>Even a casual, perfunctory consolation would do.</p><p></p><p>But very clearly, Sun Luyuan was overthinking it. The Harmonized Dao Guardians of each province, as well as those so-called important ministers of the Immortal Alliance, were really nothing more than expendable materials. Discarding them was as easy as discarding them.</p><p></p><p>"Myriad Immortal Alliance..." At this point, Sun Luyuan had completely severed any hopes he held for the Myriad Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>He fully turned towards the grand opening of the Holy Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention anything else, in recent years, the benefits I've gained from the Holy Dynasty are far more than from the Myriad Immortal Alliance that I've been risking my life for."</p><p></p><p>Beside the towering white fog barrier in Tianquan Province.</p><p></p><p>In previous years, due to the great upheaval in Xuanhuang, the white fog barrier here broke and came crashing down to the ground. The unrestrained devouring element white fog wantonly flowed and spread in all directions, mercilessly swallowing up all the living beings it enveloped.</p><p></p><p>Although the great upheaval gradually subsided later and the white fog barrier was restored, this dead zone never recovered its vitality.</p><p></p><p>This was enough to show how terrifying the devouring element white fog was.</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought that the Holy Dynasty actually has a way to almost completely negate the effects of the devouring element white fog. Meeting in this place couldn't be safer!"</p><p></p><p>After scanning the surroundings to ensure no one was following him, Sun Luyuan carefully took out the [Samantabhadra True Boat].</p><p></p><p>He flew into the boat and piloted it to drill into the white fog barrier.</p><p></p><p>Maintaining a constant speed and continuously changing directions, after traveling for a while, he indeed saw another Samantabhadra True Boat quietly stopped in the white fog.</p><p></p><p>A black light flew out from it, slightly tearing the white fog, and came in front of Sun Luyuan.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan received it and found that it was a storage ring made of black jade. When he raised his head to look again, the previous Samantabhadra True Boat had already disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"So cautious, unwilling to even show their face."</p><p></p><p>Inside the black jade ring, nearly a thousand square jade devices engraved with profound symbols were neatly arranged.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan took one out and carefully played with it while reading the instructions on how to use the jade devices that were just transmitted through the black light.</p><p></p><p>"Just bring it into a Tianxuan Sub-Mirror or transmission formation and activate it with a spell to detonate it?"</p><p></p><p>"That simple?" Sun Luyuan was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>He immediately had the urge to try it out first. However, after carefully studying it for a while, he could only shake his head helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"The time when it can be activated has already been set. It can only be detonated three years later. Before the time comes, even the core formation inside hasn't been activated, it's just an ordinary jade device..."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder I can't sense even a bit of spiritual power fluctuation."</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyuan put the jade device back, his expression gloomy: "Let those cultivators regarded as ants by the Myriad Immortal Alliance be the first to ring its death knell."</p><p></p><p>Just as the Holy Dynasty's various places began operating for the conquest plan three years later.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had also used the Lingxu Grand Formation to obliterate four small worlds.</p><p></p><p>He collected enough of what he called the [Essence of Myriad Things].</p><p></p><p>Pure energy aggregates, emitting a dreamy, viscous five-colored luster. It gave Li Fan a feeling quite similar to golden origin force essence.</p><p></p><p>"Have you learned this formation?" Li Fan asked the Immeasurable Mirror while gazing into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded in satisfaction and lightly tapped a finger, absorbing a beam of light into Sun Luyao's illusory figure: "Then next, go to these places and continue setting up the formations."</p><p></p><p>"Just quietly set up the formations, no need to activate them."</p><p></p><p>With that, Li Fan flicked all the origin force essence he had plundered from the Sun family not long ago when he returned, together to the Immeasurable Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Sun Luyao hurriedly stored the golden light and thanked Li Fan with great excitement.</p><p></p><p>Then he transformed into light and headed towards the target small worlds.</p><p></p><p>If it were the real Sun Luyao, executing Li Fan's mission alone, there was a possibility he might disobey. But now he was just a simulated personality.</p><p></p><p>Even the joy of receiving the origin force essence was fabricated, so naturally he would not go against Li Fan's orders.</p><p></p><p>"The formations set up by the Immeasurable Mirror's spirit are even worse in effect than mine. But it's more than enough to destroy a realm. After all, the weak small worlds I selected for it don't have any cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"Although this identity probably won't show up again in this world, it's proper to leave some backup plans."</p><p></p><p>The connection with the Holy Emperor had been completely severed. But Li Fan still vaguely sensed the huge changes happening to the Holy Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Did he have another epiphany in the Starry Sea?"</p><p></p><p>"The original talent of the clone was just ordinary, but with so many fortuitous encounters and destiny piled on, he really does have a bit of the aura of a Destined True Lord..." A hint of mockery flashed across Li Fan's face.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, it's doomed to be in vain!"</p><p></p><p>A thread of Li Fan's divine sense transformed into a thin line and flew towards the territory of Guangyang Province.</p><p></p><p>He was going to hand over the [Essence of Myriad Things] he collected for self-protection to his true body.</p><p></p><p>In just over half a day, Li Fan had already found his target.</p><p></p><p>The [Thousand Seeking Daoist] who had truly concealed his identity and was cultivating in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>The clone silently drifted into the body of a nearby Golden Core cultivator. That person's body paused for a moment, then quickly returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>His feet turned and he came in front of the Thousand Seeking Daoist.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, how about we play a game of chess?"</p><p></p><p>The slovenly Daoist who was picking his feet with no manners immediately raised his head.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After successfully obtaining the Audience Dao Jade Tablet from the Thousand Seeking Daoist, Li Fan first came to a small courtyard in the Dao Discussion Tower in Guangyang Province and rented it with all his possessions.</p><p></p><p>Then, using the [Dao Pill] method, he completely possessed the body of the cultivator he had attached to.</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the environment exposed in the Starry Sea's Mysterious Immortal Boat, this possession method doesn't seem to be as perfect in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan moved around and felt a bit of disharmony.</p><p></p><p>"Possessing Zhao Xian could deceive the Severed Immortal Tower."</p><p></p><p>"But possessing this person..."</p><p></p><p>"Fu Yuansheng, may not necessarily be able to escape the Myriad Immortal Alliance's inspection. I still need to temper it some more."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan operated Fu Yuansheng's body and set up a circle of formations around him.</p><p></p><p>Then he strode into the formation.</p><p></p><p>"Using the body as a vessel, tempering it with the formation~"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chanted softly, borrowing the power of the formation to slowly grind and eliminate the disharmony in the possessed body.</p><p></p><p>During this process, the experiences of the Holy Emperor's cultivation in this life, the insights of the Holy Fetus in the Mysterious Immortal Boat, and the comprehensions of the true body's secluded cultivation all came to mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan integrated and mastered them.</p><p></p><p>His fingers tapped continuously, modifying and perfecting the formation he had just set up.</p><p></p><p>The strangeness between the body and the soul also gradually disappeared completely during this period.</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, I am Fu Yuansheng!" Li Fan's clone said with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>To verify it, Li Fan first entered the Tianxuan Sub-Mirror in Guangyang Province.</p><p></p><p>As expected, he deceived the inspection of the Tianxuan Mirror and successfully arrived in Fu Yuansheng's Tianxuan Mirror space with his identity.</p><p></p><p>"A full two thousand contribution points..."</p><p></p><p>"It's quite pitiful."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed and shook his head, but didn't make any changes.</p><p></p><p>He just rested for a while as usual, then left the inside of the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Walking to the most prosperous area of Guangyang Heavenly City, he activated the Audience Dao Jade Tablet.</p><p></p><p>The suddenly erupting light immediately attracted everyone's attention.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>"This appearance of a jade tablet... Hiss, could it be that thing!"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators watching the commotion surrounded Li Fan without</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Tong, Li Fan also put on a pale face, pretending to barely hold on.</p><p></p><p>With the arrival of the receiving cultivators, the chaotic scene finally took a turn for the better.</p><p></p><p>"Silence!" The imposing aura emanating from the receiving cultivator undoubtedly demonstrated his Hua Shen stage cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding crowd instantly fell silent. The receiving cultivator weighed the jade tablet in his hand, but did not directly take Li Fan to the Immortal Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he surprisingly asked via voice transmission: "The grade of this Jing Fa jade tablet is not bad, it can be used to deduce the Dao Convergence cultivation technique... But you are only at the Golden Core stage, it's a bit of a waste."</p><p></p><p>"Are you interested in transferring this jade tablet to me? Of course, I absolutely will not mistreat you. I will still gift you a Dao Convergence cultivation technique, and even prepare all the resources you need to advance from Nascent Soul to Hua Shen stage, one by one."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you senior for your kindness..." Li Fan cupped his hands. "But I have no interest in transferring the jade tablet."</p><p></p><p>Originally thinking Li Fan would agree, the receiving cultivator's expression changed upon hearing his response: "Boy, you better think carefully! Having a Dao Convergence technique doesn't mean you can cultivate to Dao Convergence. I've already investigated your background. Without the support of a clan, relying on yourself alone, I'm afraid it will be very difficult for you to even cultivate to the Nascent Soul stage!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm doing this for your own good!" The receiving cultivator stared intently at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was a bit surprised: "Senior, did you not hear clearly? Then let me say it again."</p><p></p><p>"This junior has no interest in transferring the Jing Fa jade tablet." But this sentence was not transmitted by voice, but spoken out loud in public.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding cultivators all looked at the receiving cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Although no one dared to discuss it to his face, their eyes already explained everything.</p><p></p><p>The receiving cultivator was also quite sophisticated. His expression did not change at all: "Since that's the case, forget it. I was just kindly reminding you. A Golden Core cultivator possessing a Dao Convergence technique... who knows how many ill-intentioned people it will attract to take the risk."</p><p></p><p>"Right, Fu Yuansheng?" He also said loudly in public.</p><p></p><p>Under the receiving cultivator's deliberate control, his voice rumbled, faintly spreading throughout the entire Guangyang Heavenly City.</p><p></p><p>The city was instantly in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's gazes immediately gathered on Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Their expressions varied, but without exception, they all concealed greed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face turned completely pale. A trace of resentment and fear flashed in his eyes as he lowered his head and said, "Thank you senior for your concern."</p><p></p><p>The receiving cultivator snorted coldly before finally opening the passage to the Immortal Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>After the two left, the Guangyang Immortal City that had been suppressed into silence instantly erupted.</p><p></p><p>Golden Core cultivator, Dao Convergence technique.</p><p></p><p>The combination of these two was too impactful, instantly becoming a hot topic of discussion.</p><p></p><p>Those with quick minds had already started sending people to put pressure on the Fu family.</p><p></p><p>Without power or influence, and with low cultivation, even if one obtained a treasure, how could they protect it?</p><p></p><p>In the Debate Tower of Guangyang Heavenly City.</p><p></p><p>A white-robed cultivator watched this scene and couldn't help sighing lightly: "This receiving cultivator is really forcing people onto a dead end!"</p><p></p><p>The elegant youth opposite him also nodded in agreement: "Unless that Fu Yuansheng always hides in the Heavenly Profound Mirror and doesn't come out, disregarding the life and death of his relatives and friends, otherwise, I'm afraid he won't be able to keep that Dao Convergence technique."</p><p></p><p>The youth paused and abruptly changed the topic: "It's just a Dao Convergence technique, yet they are forcing him to such an extent between life and death. And this happened in broad daylight, under the bright sky... We came out to have some tea and already encountered one such incident. Imagine how many similar things are happening behind the scenes."</p><p></p><p>"The corruption of the Immortal Alliance is evident!"</p><p></p><p>The white-robed cultivator remained silent. After a long time, he could only shake his head and sigh helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"That's why I say, joining our Holy Dynasty and overthrowing the corrupt rule of the Immortal Alliance is the wise choice. Tianming, you've also been to our Holy Dynasty. Such forceful coercion is absolutely impossible there!" The youth transmitted his voice, speaking eloquently.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed cultivator named Tianming had to nod in agreement: "Brother Tianci, you're right. In that fishing pond, the countless treasures fished up all belong to the Great Qi commoners individually. There's no need to worry about anyone forcibly seizing them... Just based on this point alone, the Holy Dynasty is far superior to the Immortal Alliance!"</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci smiled: "I see Brother Tianming has already made up his mind."</p><p></p><p>The white-robed cultivator responded with a smile as well.</p><p></p><p>"Successfully persuaded another one. This time it's truly a gift from the heavens to me." Shang Tianci secretly thought, while the next name flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how the progress of the others is."</p><p></p><p>Without the Myriad Immortal Alliance noticing, such changes were constantly happening in various places.</p><p></p><p>Once people's hearts are lost, it's only a matter of time before they are persuaded and convinced.</p><p></p><p>Immortal Alliance Headquarters.</p><p></p><p>When he once again arrived at the Immortal Alliance headquarters in the body of Fu Yuansheng.</p><p></p><p>As expected, just like the previous few times, Li Fan once again fell into an illusion.</p><p></p><p>The master of the illusion was still the Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the scene this time was different from before.</p><p></p><p>Below the continuous immortal mountains shrouded in clouds and mist, a middle-aged man over fifty was ruthlessly stopped.</p><p></p><p>"How can a mortal like you recklessly intrude into the immortal realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Strange, isn't there an illusion formation set up on the perimeter? How did this mortal break in?"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man rolled a few times on the ground in a somewhat sorry state, but then actually got up as if nothing happened and said with a smile: "Immortal master, can you give me a chance? I feel... I should be able to cultivate."</p><p></p><p>The cultivator sneered upon hearing this: "You're already half buried in the ground, yet you still want to cultivate? Cultivation requires aptitude and resources. Someone like you..."</p><p></p><p>The cultivator's face was full of disdain: "Even if you can forcibly cultivate, our Tianyuan Sect will not accept you!"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man did not give up and even stretched out his arm, handing it over: "Immortal master, if you don't believe me, take a look. My aptitude..."</p><p></p><p>Killing intent flashed in the cultivator's eyes. His internal spiritual energy surged, about to blast this ignorant thing to death.</p><p></p><p>But then a kind voice was heard from above: "What's your name?"</p><p></p><p>"Xuanyuan Goudan... no, Xuanyuan Tuo, my name is Xuanyuan Tuo." The middle-aged man said somewhat stiffly.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle-Master Xu!" The cultivator's expression changed. He immediately retracted the killing intent in his heart and hurriedly bowed to the newcomer.</p><p></p><p>Also appearing middle-aged, but this Uncle-Master Xu looked much more spirited than Xuanyuan Tuo.</p><p></p><p>He came to Xuanyuan Tuo's side and carefully examined him.</p><p></p><p>He even stretched out his hand and sent a strand of spiritual energy into Xuanyuan Tuo's body to check.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Uncle-Master Xu shook his head slightly, saying with some regret: "Although you indeed have sufficient cultivation of the heart, your age is really too old. It will be difficult to achieve anything."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid it will be extremely difficult for you to even build a foundation..."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Tuo quickly said: "Immortal master, my requirements are not high. As long as I can cultivate. I've plowed the fields for half my life, but my heart has always been unsettled. I feel I shouldn't spend my whole life in the fields."</p><p></p><p>Uncle-Master Xu was a bit surprised. He didn't expect this old farmer in front of him to be able to say such words.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was hesitating, a crisp bell sound suddenly rang out from the distant mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>The blue-robed cultivator behind him also spoke up to remind: "Uncle-Master, the sect leader has called for a meeting."</p><p></p><p>Uncle-Master Xu looked back at the mountain peak and swallowed the words he was about to say.</p><p></p><p>He took out a book and handed it to Xuanyuan Tuo.</p><p></p><p>"Go back first and read this scripture. If you can cultivate spiritual energy within a year, you can come find me again." With that, Uncle-Master Xu flew away.</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Tuo's eyes went wide.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Qin, don't make things difficult for him." Before leaving, Uncle-Master Xu specially instructed.</p><p></p><p>The blue-robed cultivator nodded in agreement. Looking at Xuanyuan Tuo, he snorted coldly: "Truly a fool's luck."</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and leave! Come back when you've really cultivated spiritual power!"</p><p></p><p>After walking for a while, he seemed to remember something. His face greatly changed and he wanted to look back, but found that the previously vast immortal mountain had disappeared at some point.</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Tuo slapped his thigh hard, filled with regret: "I can't read!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The illusion shattered and Li Fan returned to reality.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the content just now, his expression was strange.</p><p></p><p>"What did you see?" The receiving cultivator beside him asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan put on a shocked appearance and answered: "I saw the Heavenly Venerate Dharma Transmission creating heaven and earth, spreading the Dao in the world..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph. The Immortal Alliance headquarters retains a trace of the Heavenly Venerate's aura, so all cultivators entering here for the first time will experience illusions..." The receiving cultivator snorted coldly before explaining.</p><p></p><p>He brought Li Fan all the way to the Dharma Protector Hall headquarters.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Li Fan secretly pondered.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what this illusion I saw is related to?"</p><p></p><p>"This Dharma Transmission also has some strange hobbies, actually placing his own life here for his disciples to observe..."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I didn't expect the dignified Dharma Transmission Heavenly Venerate to have such an inglorious past."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan found it difficult to associate that dark-skinned old farmer with the white-haired, long-bearded old man with a sorrowful face.</p><p></p><p>"If that Tianyuan Sect had accepted Dharma Transmission back then, perhaps the history of the Xuanhuang Realm would have taken a different course?"</p><p></p><p>"But not necessarily."</p><p></p><p>"After Dharma Transmission's awakening, it's not something a small sect like that could change. Speaking of which, after the great calamity descended, Tianyuan Sect couldn't hold on for long before perishing from internal strife."</p><p></p><p>"As for that Uncle-Master Xu, he looks a bit similar to the current Dharma Protector Hall's chief Xu Yuanxian. He should be his ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, numerous thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>When he reached the blue stone path outside the Dharma Protector Hall, Li Fan collected his thoughts again.</p><p></p><p>Using the Jing Fa jade tablet in the exact same steps as his previous life, after waiting in line for a few days, he finally entered the space of the Dharma Deduction Orb.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the "listless" Dharma Deduction Orb, Li Fan pretended to be very excited.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you here again." The Dharma Deduction Orb mumbled, her bored expression not an act.</p><p></p><p>This kind of personalized technique deduction using the Jing Fa jade tablet required her to take action herself.</p><p></p><p>"What are your requirements!" The Dharma Deduction Orb threw a piece of paper over.</p><p></p><p>Just as it was about to reach him, it was caught by the "Sun Ang" guarding here.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Ang's action attracted the attention of the other two guardians.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Sun, is something wrong?" Hua Yueye's expression was a bit solemn.</p><p></p><p>Sun Ang shook his head: "It's just that I suddenly had a vague feeling that something was off. It's better to carefully check again."</p><p></p><p>After all, it was for the sake of the Dharma Deduction Orb's safety.

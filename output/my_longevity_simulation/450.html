        <h1>Chapter 450</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I didn't expect that the newly born Tianming Xuan Bird could actually suppress the black double-headed snake solely based on its momentum.</p><p></p><p>Watching the Xuan Bird hiding in Xu Kek's thick hair, a greedy look filled Song Yang's eyes even more.</p><p></p><p>However, he also knew that he couldn't count on the black double-headed snake, so it seemed he had to figure out another way.</p><p></p><p>With a cold snort, Song Yang placated his spiritual beast and turned away.</p><p></p><p>Resolving the crisis invisibly, Li Fan let out a sigh of relief and retreated back into his "nest."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke touched his head, looking puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Time continued to pass, and the strength of the Xuan Bird transformed by Li Fan kept getting stronger.</p><p></p><p>Soon, it reached the first transformative joint.</p><p></p><p>The jet-black fur had already covered its entire body, with a hint of purple and gold, possibly due to absorbing Xu Ke's luck since it was young.</p><p></p><p>Due to its cultivation and ability to control freely, its body did not swell but maintained a size that could still sleep in Xu Ke's hair.</p><p></p><p>Relying solely on its physical body, it was already able to engage in a back-and-forth battle with a late-stage Foundation Establishment period demon beast.</p><p></p><p>He had long unlocked the spiritual connection with Xu Ke, but Li Fan had always ignored him, so Xu Ke was foolishly unaware.</p><p></p><p>Instead, Li Fan took the opportunity to constantly peek into Xu Ke's mind, trying to extract the foundational technique "Beast Taming Decision" of the Beast Taming Sect.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this silly kid's thoughts were too erratic, like a wild horse running free, elusive. And the "Beast Taming Decision" seemed to come with a prohibition that prevented spiritual beasts from prying, so Li Fan had been unsuccessful.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Li Fan, who was sunbathing and sleeping in Xu Ke's hair, inexplicably felt a sense of awakening, suddenly stood up with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>"Calculating the time, today is the day when Mr. Bai will appear."</p><p></p><p>To avoid attracting attention, Li Fan quickly shrunk back and observed in secret.</p><p></p><p>A half day later, with a resounding dragon roar echoing through the sky, Mr. Bai made his official appearance.</p><p></p><p>Just like in his previous life, there was no one in the Beast Taming Sect who could match Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Dragon, White Tiger with wings, Qilin with two horns...</p><p></p><p>Many exotic beasts were cut down for their body parts, used by Mr. Bai as "gifts for the children."</p><p></p><p>The painful wails echoed in the Beast Taming Sect.</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the Beast Taming Sect stood there in shock, trembling.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Li Fan made his move.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing his inner fear, he turned into a black light and soared through the skies in the midst of the rain of demon beast blood.</p><p></p><p>Yes, Li Fan's target was Mr. Bai!</p><p></p><p>He had always suspected deep down.</p><p></p><p>Could this Mr. Bai from the Meteor Immortal Realm be the future "Tianyi" in the real world several years later?</p><p></p><p>Because the similarities between the two were quite numerous.</p><p></p><p>The same mastery of medical arts, unfathomable strength, and morally ambiguous methods.</p><p></p><p>In the "Ningyuan Life Fruit" incident, Li Fan had never been able to see the true face of Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>And now, in this "Beast Taming Sect's Change," affected by unknown reasons, Li Fan, who looked up from below, still couldn't see his appearance.</p><p></p><p>Hence, Li Fan's attempt at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to get close to Mr. Bai and find out the truth!</p><p></p><p>Honestly, with his current cultivation of just the Foundation Establishment period, it was nothing short of a fool's dream to achieve this without external assistance.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan still had some confidence.</p><p></p><p>All thanks to Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ke was the chosen one of fate, and after becoming his companion spirit beast, Li Fan also received the blessing of luck.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xu Ke was also one of the "children" mentioned by Mr. Bai!</p><p></p><p>With this connection, Li Fan believed that if what Mr. Bai was showing now was genuine, then he wouldn't be in danger.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this was in the Meteor Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if he fell, it would only be damage to his spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Entirely worth trying.</p><p></p><p>At the moment of the Beast Taming Sect's defeat, Li Fan, transformed into black light, was so eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>Like a shooting star flying against all odds, determined and resolute.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>"How could it be so bold?"</p><p></p><p>Even the powerful exotic beasts comparable to Nascent Soul stage cultivators were defeated in front of this formidable figure, and this seemingly Foundation Establishment-level black bird, where did it find the courage?</p><p></p><p>Amidst the people's shock and confusion, Li Fan ascended rapidly, continuously approaching the figure in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai looked over.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan felt like the surrounding space, even his thoughts, were frozen.</p><p></p><p>Plunged into absolute stillness.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how long had passed, or maybe it was just a moment later.</p><p></p><p>The restraints around him vanished instantly, and Li Fan regained the ability to move.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the power of top-tier experts..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was amazed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He finally understood why, when facing the Ink Slayer in the past, those who had slain the Red Blaze, successfully reached the Dao, seemed foolish, standing there as if waiting to die.</p><p></p><p>Not resisting or fleeing.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that they didn't want to, but they couldn't!</p><p></p><p>The reason Li Fan could break free from the shackles of Mr. Bai had nothing to do with himself at all in this moment. It was because he heard Xu Ke's exclamation below.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Hei!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan believed that every move in the Beast Taming Sect could not escape Mr. Bai's eyes.</p><p></p><p>When Xu Ke shouted like that, he would naturally notice the relationship between the Xuan Bird possessing Li Fan and Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he would no longer harm Li Fan, even allowing the bold Xuan Bird to fly close to him.</p><p></p><p>With this close observation, Li Fan finally saw Mr. Bai's appearance clearly.</p><p></p><p>Despite his experience of reincarnation over hundreds of lifetimes, he couldn't help but be completely stunned at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He finally understood why Mr. Bai was described as exceptionally good-looking when he inquired about him in Ningyuan City.</p><p></p><p>Slightly fragile in demeanor, but a face that seemed flawless, breathtakingly beautiful.</p><p></p><p>As if all the beauty of the world was concentrated in him, in Li Fan's mind right now, there were only thoughts like, "Why would there be such a good-looking person in the world," "It's a pity he's not a woman."</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai looked at the Xuan Bird standing dumbfounded in the air and smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Li Fan felt like the sky that had been obscured by dark clouds had instantly cleared up.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai looked at Li Fan, shaking his head slightly, "Why are you practicing recklessly on your own?"</p><p></p><p>With a light tap, countless pieces of information flooded into Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>This is...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>Then his heart began to beat uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Including all the secrets of life, as well as various paths to sublimation and evolution...</p><p></p><p>That was the perfect version of the "Heavenly Refining Technique" he had cultivated.</p><p></p><p>The true "Heavenly Refining Technique"!</p>

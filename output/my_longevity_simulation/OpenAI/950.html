            <p>Li Fan's expression changed noticeably at the words.</p><p></p><p>Seeming like he was about to erupt, but eventually maintaining his patience, he explained quietly, "Friend Xin, despite only being at the Core Formation realm, the spirit I summon surpasses me in combat strength. Even a Nascent Soul cultivator could withstand it..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Xin Hongzhang, upon hearing this, became more serious.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't believe me, we can test it out," Li Fan said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>The slightly intoxicated Xin Hongzhang carefully observed Li Fan again.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, he's only at Core Formation cultivation. Even if he harbors malicious intent, I could easily defeat him. Well, let's see what he's up to," Xin Hongzhang thought.</p><p></p><p>Not sensing any malice from Li Fan, only genuine sincerity.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Xin Hongzhang agreed to Li Fan's suggestion.</p><p></p><p>The two of them left the defensive fortress.</p><p></p><p>Until they flew to a desolate place in the Jiushan State with no one around.</p><p></p><p>"Fan brother, I think this place will do. Let me witness your so-called spirit manifestation," Xin Hongzhang abruptly stopped and said to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked around and nodded, saying, "Alright, Xin, keep your distance. I'm afraid of accidentally hurting you..."</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang smiled inwardly but complied. (ùüèùüîùüóùêíùêáùêîùêó.ùêÇùêéùêå)</p><p></p><p>He watched with interest as Li Fan's expression became serious, chanting softly, "May the world be compassionate, blessing all. As I pray, let the divine spirit descend..."</p><p></p><p>"Enact!"</p><p></p><p>"This guy is really taking it seriously," Xin Hongzhang thought.</p><p></p><p>However, he soon sensed a sinister and powerful aura, and the playful demeanor in Xin Hongzhang's heart vanished instantly.</p><p></p><p>It was replaced with utmost solemnity.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>A creature with a human body and a sheep head appeared before Xin Hongzhang as summoned by Li Fan's friend named Fan Li.</p><p></p><p>The creature kept its eyes closed, but Xin Hongzhang felt like he was being watched.</p><p></p><p>Shadow and light appeared on the creature with a sheep head, making it look eerie yet sacred.</p><p></p><p>"How's that, Xin?" Li Fan's voice came.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Xin Hongzhang awaken from the shock.</p><p></p><p>He didn't answer but assessed the strength of the creature in front of him.</p><p></p><p>And the other party seemed to have grasped his thoughts, softly saying, "Looking alone won't help, Xin. Are you interested in sparring with my spirit manifestation?"</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, Xin!" Li Fan lightly warned. (New69's book ‚Üí 69shux.com)</p><p></p><p>The sheep-headed creature disappeared in an instant, only to reappear behind Xin Hongzhang the next moment.</p><p></p><p>"This speed..." Before he could be astonished, Xin Hongzhang felt the creature's large hands tightly gripping his neck from behind.</p><p></p><p>Unable to break free, Xin Hongzhang's vision suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>As if plunged into boundless nightmare, the sky was filled with interwoven blood moons.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by thousands of terrifying demons with no end in sight, all looking at him.</p><p></p><p>Under the oppressive atmosphere of horror, Xin Hongzhang's thoughts seemed frozen in an instant.</p><p></p><p>He completely gave up resistance and offered himself up!</p><p></p><p>"Xin, friend?"</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until Li Fan's call that he woke from the nightmare.</p><p></p><p>"You..." Xin Hongzhang looked around, realizing the sheep-headed creature had disappeared. He looked at Li Fan with a puzzled and hesitant expression.</p><p></p><p>"How was the strength of this spirit manifestation?" Li Fan asked proudly.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Xin Hongzhang finally uttered four words, "I'm no match..."</p><p></p><p>"It's alright, there's no restriction on sharing this secret technique. If you're interested, I can pass it on to you," Li Fan said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Having personally experienced the terrifying power of the spirit manifestation, Xin Hongzhang subconsciously wanted to agree.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of the dark and eerie experience he had just encountered, Xin Hongzhang couldn't help but hesitate.</p><p></p><p>This secret technique seemed a bit suspicious.</p><p></p><p>And such a profound and magical technique being taught for free?</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang had many doubts.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly sensing Xin Hongzhang's concerns, Li Fan smiled and, taking him down to the ground, began to explain.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, my willingness to pass on the spirit manifestation to you does have some selfish motive."</p><p></p><p>"All this has to start from the origin of this technique. It is said that in ancient times, when gods and demons ravaged the world, our human race was just the food for the gods and demons, leading to a tragic fate. A compassionate sage emerged, making a great vow to suppress all gods and demons in the world and bring peace to the world..."</p><p></p><p>"Are you saying that the sheep-headed creature you just summoned was an ancient god or demon that had been suppressed?" Xin Hongzhang's expression was somewhat peculiar.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded, "Although the sage suppressed all gods and demons, they did not perish. To prevent their escape, the sage used themselves as a prison, eternally suppressing them."</p><p></p><p>"And to prevent exhaustion in the distant future, the sage left behind this secret technique. Anyone who practices the spirit manifestation technique can suppress boundless gods and demons. In return, they can summon the projected gods and demons for their own battles from the divine prison..."</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang was feeling a bit dizzy from listening.</p><p></p><p>He had never heard of the compassionate sage or the gods and demons before.</p><p></p><p>It contradicted his previous worldview and was hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued, "Initially, like you, I found this matter too absurd. However, after successfully practicing this secret technique and summoning the divine projections, I understood..."</p><p></p><p>"This technique is not a native technique of the Yellow Emperor's Realm. The events recorded didn't happen within the Yellow Emperor's Realm. However, the power of the technique is truly effective."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Xin Hongzhang suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, this technique has a unique characteristic. Each person who practices the technique has a unique mark. After passing on the technique to others, this mark doesn't disappear. Instead, it benefits from the next practitioner of the technique, summoning more and stronger divine projections..."</p><p></p><p>This was somewhat abstract, and Xin Hongzhang didn't fully understand its meaning at first.</p><p></p><p>But soon, Li Fan began to demonstrate it practically.</p><p></p><p>"For example..."</p><p></p><p>Three monstrous demons full of evil instantly appeared around Xin Hongzhang, surrounding him.</p><p></p><p>Encased by endless demonic energy, Xin Hongzhang swallowed nervously, unable to move.</p><p></p><p>"I have already passed this secret technique to over a dozen worthy individuals, thus enabling the summoning of three divine projections."</p><p></p><p>"The more practitioners the technique is passed on to, the more divine projections can be summoned. This is why I don't mind, and even willingly want to pass on this 'Spirit Manifestation' secret technique to you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled as he spoke.</p>

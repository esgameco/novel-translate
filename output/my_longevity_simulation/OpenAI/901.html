        <h1>Chapter 901</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>However, the voice was very loud, spreading throughout the entire Ningyuan City in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Song Hesong stared in shock at the scene in front of him, his mind going blank for a moment, unable to react.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quickly flew towards Zhang Qianmo, while also tossing the jade box containing three Longevity Fruits in the opposite direction.</p><p></p><p>Song Hesong hesitated for a moment but ultimately chose to go receive the jade box first.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Li Fan bought himself some time to catch his breath.</p><p></p><p>"Younger Brother?!" Zhang Qianmo sensed what was happening on Li Fan's side and shouted angrily, appearing beside Li Fan as fast as lightning.</p><p></p><p>"Attack!" Although uncertain why Song Hesong chose to attack first, with things having reached this point, the arrow had to be let go once it was on the bowstring.</p><p></p><p>Chu Liang and the other four ambushers hidden in the city revealed themselves.</p><p></p><p>After receiving the Longevity Fruits, Song Hesong also flew over slowly.</p><p></p><p>The five individuals had unfriendly expressions, surrounding Zhang Qianmo and seemingly unconscious Li Fan in the center.</p><p></p><p>The other four glared at Zhang Qianmo, while only Song Hesong looked at Li Fan with a hint of doubt.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Zhang! Long time no see!" Chu Liang sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother? Do I know you?" Zhang Qianmo's cold gaze swept over him, revealing a hint of killing intent in his tone.</p><p></p><p>Chu Liang's voice froze, then he erupted in anger.</p><p></p><p>What followed was not much different from what Li Fan had experienced before.</p><p></p><p>But this time, he had to protect the heavily injured "Junior Brother" under the siege of the group. Zhang Qianmo revealed his Purple Dan in advance.</p><p></p><p>Facing the five assailants, Senior Brother Zhang easily crushed them with overwhelming force.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, he ignored these insignificant figures and swiftly returned to the Purple Cloud Sect with the still unconscious Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the noise, Li Fan soon felt someone treating his injuries.</p><p></p><p>To make the act more convincing, he really didn't hold back in his self-injury just now.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, it was not a hopeless situation.</p><p></p><p>After slow adjustment and treatment, his injuries finally stabilized, with no threat to his life.</p><p></p><p>But under Li Fan's deliberate control, he remained in a state of unconsciousness.</p><p></p><p>Initially, there were many visitors coming to see him.</p><p></p><p>However, as time passed, there was only occasional visits from Zhang Qianmo.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's room became increasingly desolate.</p><p></p><p>And so, half a year later.</p><p></p><p>On this night, a ghostly figure silently arrived at Li Fan's bedside.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, the figure's features were indiscernible.</p><p></p><p>Just staring at the sleeping Li Fan, it revealed a sinister smile.</p><p></p><p>Then, a faint dividing line appeared between him and Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The scene distorted, the room split into two as a dividing line separated them.</p><p></p><p>Transforming into completely opposite mirrored worlds.</p><p></p><p>The figure, whose features couldn't be seen, now appeared seriously injured, lying quietly on the bed.</p><p></p><p>As the dividing line emitted flickering lights, the two mirrored worlds gradually approached and merged with each other.</p><p></p><p>When the two figures fully merged.</p><p></p><p>The dividing line vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>In the dark room, calmness was restored.</p><p></p><p>However, within the consciousness of the body lying on the bed, turbulent changes occurred.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? This Li Chen's soul, is it actually an empty shell?"</p><p></p><p>After devouring the body lying on the bed, Li Fan from the Purple Cloud Sect, the King of Xuan Tian Sect, found nothing in his soul.</p><p></p><p>Like an apple hollowed out by worms, only the thin outer layer existed!</p><p></p><p>The King of Xuan Tian Sect felt a sense of unease, thinking this was a trap set by the Ten Sects of Immortality to capture him.</p><p></p><p>However, his expression changed suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Because upon merging with "Li Chen's" soul, he seemed to have acquired some foreign objects in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Cleverly hidden.</p><p></p><p>Even with his recent shock, he had neglected the other party's existence.</p><p></p><p>When he came to his senses, that small speck couldn't escape his scrutiny.</p><p></p><p>Discovering that the other party was peeking into his memories, the King of Xuan Tian Sect became enraged.</p><p></p><p>With a mental roar, he instantly crushed the speck into pieces.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Ah..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who returned to reality from the Fallen Immortal Realm, let out a muffled groan.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that his soul had suffered some damage from the experience in the Fallen Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Law of Infinite Void naturally operated to heal his injuries.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to immerse himself in the memories he had just seen in the King of Xuan Tian Sect's mind.</p><p></p><p>Though it was a brief glimpse, it allowed him to glimpse extensive and crucially shocking information.</p><p></p><p>"King of Xuan Tian, Star-Transcending Great Formation."</p><p></p><p>"And..."</p><p></p><p>"Faceless True Immortal."</p><p></p><p>A strange color burst in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The King of Xuan Tian Sect, who had possessed Li Chen, was called Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>In the ancient cultivation world, before the establishment of the Xuan Tian Sect, he was a member of the Immortal Cultivation Sect Nine Refining Sect.</p><p></p><p>Later, he was persuaded by the King of Xuan Tian to join the Xuan Tian Sect.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"At the Darkest Star Sea, there is a mighty wall."</p><p></p><p>"I never expected to have traversed into such an extreme place."</p><p></p><p>Yet, there was not a hint of despair in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>Having gained knowledge of a larger world backdrop, his perspective instantly broadened.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that my previous idea of fleeing from the Xuanhuang Realm cannot be realized. To seek a chance of survival, I must base myself in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Is it the power of a True Immortal that can leap over this wall?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze flickered.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have realized a possible breakthrough, and his thoughts rapidly changed.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Stone Tablet said, while we are fishing in the Fishing Pool, the Fishing Pool is also fishing the heavens, gathering treasures from the outside to supplement itself."</p><p></p><p>"If the information I obtained from Mo Rubin's consciousness is true, then this starry sky where the Xuanhuang Realm is located has mostly been devoured by the Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>"Then..."</p><p></p><p>"It is highly likely that the newest treasures collected by the Fishing Pool come from 'beyond the High Wall'."</p><p></p><p>"This also means that the so-called High Wall is not completely sealed."</p><p></p><p>"Inside and outside the High Wall can still communicate. Just like..."</p><p></p><p>"Like the Faceless True Immortal statue."</p><p></p><p>After grasping some truths, Li Fan's worries about the statue named Mo Rubin diminished somewhat.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, places like the Darkest Star Sea were not ones even True Immortals ventured into easily.</p><p></p><p>Thinking optimistically, this also meant that, aside from the True Immortal within the Immortal Ruins, Li Fan didn't have to worry about other True Immortals descending at least for the time being.</p><p></p><p>"At the Darkest Star Sea. A forbidden land for living beings."</p><p></p><p>"But for me, it is a relatively safer place for cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Provided that he could successfully come out of this dead place.</p><p></p><p>With the newfound information, Li Fan's fears about Mo Rubin lessened and he even began to consider how to derive some advantages from him.</p>

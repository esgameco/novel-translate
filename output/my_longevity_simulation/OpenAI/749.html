        <div class="content">
            <p>"It's really amazing."</p><p></p><p>The girl's tone became somewhat dreamy: "It's like seeing another version of myself in the mirror, and I can't help but feel close to it."</p><p></p><p>"Master Qing, what exactly is going on here?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the girl's affirmative answer, a look of disbelief also appeared in Xiao Qing's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai was unaware of what was happening on the other side of the wall.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his mind was completely immersed in the enlightenment of the Red Rope Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>As his understanding deepened, the red rope that suppressed the black flesh seemed to come alive. It gently floated to Xu Bai's side, affectionately circling him.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, Xu Bai suddenly opened his eyes and flicked his fingers lightly.</p><p></p><p>An almost imperceptible red light flashed from his hand, then flew towards the twisted flesh ahead.</p><p></p><p>The wailing voices echoing in the temple fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Though it immediately resumed after a moment.</p><p></p><p>But this strange phenomenon still greatly shocked the woman in a gauze skirt waiting behind Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>"Sir..." She couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai, however, stopped her question with a gesture, only looking at the faint bloodstain that appeared on his wrist at some point.</p><p></p><p>With the physique of a newly-born Yuan Infant cultivator, even if he suffered cuts and wounds, they could instantly heal. However, this slight bloodstain seemed inherent and couldn't be dispelled.</p><p></p><p>"Such serious side effects." Xu Bai couldn't help but furrow his brow slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Xu Ke's disappearance years ago may also be related to his repeated use of the Red Rope Sword Art."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Wooden Sword contains all the sword principles in the world, it cannot strike first."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Rope Sword's killing intent is unparalleled, it requires one's own life in exchange."</p><p></p><p>A glint shimmered in Xu Bai's eyes. "They all have certain limitations. Interesting..."</p><p></p><p>Next, Xu Bai successively visited the remaining eight temples.</p><p></p><p>Aside from deeper understanding of the Red Rope Sword Art, he also witnessed the unyielding gaze of the three unburied heads of the Crimson Nine-Headed Beast.</p><p></p><p>The hair, flesh, and eyeballs of one head had been hollowed out by the Imperial people, leaving only the mottled skull.</p><p></p><p>However, the other two heads remained alive and spirited as if freshly dead.</p><p></p><p>One could sense the boundless malevolence and resentment emanating from them even from a distance.</p><p></p><p>"A truly heinous beast!"</p><p></p><p>This was Xu Bai's first encounter with a true ancient monstrous beast, causing an inexplicable chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"A thousand years after death, the vicious nature remains. I wonder how fierce it was in its prime. And Mr. Bai, who managed to slay it with just a red rope..."</p><p></p><p>Thoughts raced through Xu Bai's mind.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the tour, Xu Bai returned to the towering palace. </p><p></p><p>Looking at the woman sitting next to Xiao Qing, her face veiled, Xu Bai felt a strange connection in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He tried to raise his right hand.</p><p></p><p>Something that surprised him happened.</p><p></p><p>The woman in front, despite no prior agreement, also raised her right hand almost synchronously.</p><p></p><p>Without prior coordination, they were almost perfectly synchronized.</p><p></p><p>It felt like there was a mirror between them.</p><p></p><p>Except for some differences in appearance, the veiled woman was almost like himself.</p><p></p><p>"The Sacred Blood Embryo Transformation Technique." In an instant, Xu Bai knew the reason for this phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>He also knew the identity of the woman in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Empress.</p><p></p><p>The descendant of Xu Ke, the nominal ruler of the Empire.</p><p></p><p>But he clearly could not reveal it.</p><p></p><p>Feigning extreme surprise, he suddenly stood up, pointing at the Empress, and exclaimed, "What is going on here?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing observed Xu Bai's every expression carefully, trying to find some flaws. But she was disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's behavior was almost identical to the Empress.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that he is also unaware of his true identity," Xiao Qing thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Bai seemed to have calmed down from his initial shock. He stared at the Empress, his eyes filled with deep perplexity.</p><p></p><p>"Who is this? Although we are meeting for the first time, I feel a strong sense of familiarity with her."</p><p></p><p>"It's not an illusion. I feel the same way," the Empress softly responded.</p><p></p><p>Now, Xu Bai seemed even more shocked.</p><p></p><p>Turning back to Xiao Qing, he asked, "Friend Qing, what is going on here?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing stared at him for a long time before speaking. Instead of answering, she asked, "Xu friend, how much do you know about your origins?"</p><p></p><p>"My origins?" Xu Bai looked puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"I am just an ordinary human, originally living in a small world. Later, by chance, I joined the Multiverse Union, embarking on the path of immortality. My closest blood relatives have long passed away..."</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong? Is there something unusual about my origins?" Xu Bai asked.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing looked into Xu Bai's eyes, trying to discern the truth in his words.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, she finally gave up.</p><p></p><p>Then Xiao Qing took out a portrait, with the figure on it almost identical to Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>"What is this..." Xu Bai continued to play dumb.</p><p></p><p>"This is the founder of the Empire, also my master," Xiao Qing said in a deep tone. "His name is Xu Ke."</p><p></p><p>"Many years ago, he bid farewell to everyone and disappeared. Since then, his whereabouts have been unknown."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai stared at the portrait, seemingly struck by the heavy information, standing still in shock.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he finally spoke slowly, "He also surnamed Xu. Could it be that I am also a descendant of Xu Ke?"</p><p></p><p>"From the current situation, this seems to be the only reasonable explanation," Xiao Qing's tone also sounded uncertain.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Xu, where is your hometown, in which small world? Based on what I know about the master, he doesn't seem like someone who would marry and have children..." Xiao Qing asked inexplicably.</p><p></p><p>"My hometown is..." Xu Bai began but suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Coming back to his senses, he immediately accused, looking at Xiao Qing and the Empress with suspicion, "Friend Qing, are you playing tricks on me like a child? How could this be so coincidental?"</p><p></p><p>"Enough talk; what is your purpose?" Xu Bai looked coldly at Xiao Qing as his attitude suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>Faced with Xu Bai's sudden change in attitude, Xiao Qing couldn't help but be stunned.</p><p></p><p>After a slight smile, she said, "Honestly, even I find it hard to believe. But everything is just so coincidental. It's like it's meant to be, that I would meet you thousands of years later when I had long given up."</p><p></p><p>"As for whether what I said is true, there is a way to find out."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, she signaled to the Empress.</p><p></p><p>The Empress took out a scepter and lightly tapped the ground.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a hole appeared on the floor, swallowing the three of them instantly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai did not resist and found himself in a vast space without visible end.</p><p></p><p>Rows of different beast carcasses filled this place.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, various mechanical devices seemed to be stored.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai wanted to move forward but found an invisible barrier blocking his way.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Imperial Treasury, where the wealth accumulated by the Empire over thousands of years is stored."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

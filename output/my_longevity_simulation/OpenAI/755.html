        <h1>Chapter 755</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"The Transcendent of Salvation, defying the principles of life and death."</p><p></p><p>"But once the resurrected cultivators are brought back to life, they are unable to achieve longevity ever since."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai seemed to have an epiphany.</p><p></p><p>"However, for the majority of cultivators in the world, longevity is an unattainable existence. Even if they know about it, they probably won't care much."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xu Bai seemed to remember something and furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>He calculated the scenarios that would appear in the Xuanhuang Realm several years later.</p><p></p><p>"The original Xuanhuang Realm, where cultivators are born and nurtured naturally, born and perished. With the passage of time, although the probability is extremely small, there will always be new Transcendents of Salvation born at intervals, even if it takes thousands or tens of thousands of years."</p><p></p><p>"But now, with the existence of the Salvation Hall, the resurrected cultivators have gradually occupied the quota of naturally born cultivators, causing the number of naturally born cultivators to decrease."</p><p></p><p>"And the probability of achieving longevity, which is already very low, will become increasingly rare."</p><p></p><p>"Finally, until..."</p><p></p><p>"There are no new realms of longevity born in the world."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai stroked his chin. "The Xuanghuang Realm is cut off. Forge one's own path and leave no way for others in the world."</p><p></p><p>"These domineering methods are quite similar to the style of the Law-Transmitting Transcendents."</p><p></p><p>"However, for the existing Transcendents of Longevity, it is actually a good thing. This might be the reason why those few from the Five Elders did not intervene to stop the Transcendents of Salvation."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After all, not all small worlds have terrifying figures like the White-browed Elder reigning over them.</p><p></p><p>The setbacks encountered during the expedition of the Immortal Alliance cultivators were quickly forgotten. Occasionally, when faced with fiercely resisted small worlds, with the help of companions, they were quickly suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Fifty, one hundred, one hundred and thirty-six...</p><p></p><p>The number of explored small worlds increased rapidly.</p><p></p><p>In the Tianxuan Treasure Mirror, Xu Bai gathered all the images of the conquering process of these small worlds and their current conditions.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that it was about time, he made an appointment with Liu San to return to the Imperial World together.</p><p></p><p>Blocking the perception of the Tianxuan Treasure Mirror, the two entered successively and met in the dark void.</p><p></p><p>Having informed each other of the precautions beforehand, Liu San also changed his appearance, and the two sped through the void.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually a branch of the Beast Control Sect, which is quite rare when you think about it," scanning below outside the Imperial World, Liu San couldn't help but exclaim at the endless and bizarre beasts.</p><p></p><p>"But it's just a branch of the Beast Control Sect. The true heritage of the Beast Control Sect seems to be hiding in the Lingxu Realm. After thousands of years, who knows what it has evolved into," Xu Bai casually conveyed through voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>"Lingxu Realm, have I heard of it before?" Liu San was slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Liu San shook his head slightly. "Strange, I can't seem to recall. Could it be that I've gotten so old?"</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter, with the current dominance of the Immortal Alliance in various realms, they will eventually expose themselves. Are there any acquaintances in the Beast Control Sect that Mr. Liu knows?" Xu Bai asked.</p><p></p><p>"I've only heard of their name and haven't had any dealings with them," Liu San seemed preoccupied with his lost memories, absentmindedly answering. He was still pondering where that faint inkling of memory came from.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Li Fan in the Longevity Valley suddenly felt uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>It had been a long time since such a thing had happened, and Li Fan didn't dare to be careless.</p><p></p><p>Halting his actions of feeding the data to the disintegration disc through the array, he looked serious, his mind racing to pinpoint the source of this sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, he arrived at a possible answer.</p><p></p><p>As a strong practitioner of the Dao, Liu San was clearly not incompetent enough to forget what had happened to him in the past. Even if he couldn't recall it momentarily, after a round of searching with his divine sense, he should be able to remember.</p><p></p><p>But this unusual occurrence happened nonetheless.</p><p></p><p>"It's because the memories related to the Lingxu Realm in his mind have been tampered with, silently."</p><p></p><p>"Only Transcendents of Longevity would be able to modify the consciousness of a Dao expert without a trace. Liu San had never come into contact with any Transcendents of Longevity in the first half of his life."</p><p></p><p>"So the problem lies in the【True Inducing Fruit】that I used on him initially."</p><p></p><p>Reflecting on the altered content of Liu San's memories, Li Fan suddenly realized, "The Lingxu Realm, it should be something mentioned by the true young master of the Medicine King Sect, Liu Yihang, in a conversation."</p><p></p><p>As a precaution, Li Fan had not executed Liu Yihang at the time.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he hid him in one of the unobtrusive rooms of the Medicine King's True Cauldron, which only Li Fan himself could open.</p><p></p><p>Liu Yihang was still in a deep sleep within the Grand Dream Spring Array.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the three elders of the Medicine King Sect were not present, and Li Fan had no qualms about his actions.</p><p></p><p>He let Liu Yihang out of the Medicine King's True Cauldron and then brought him into his own personal sanctum.</p><p></p><p>With the effect of the array removed, Liu Yihang slowly regained consciousness.</p><p></p><p>But instantly, he realized that something was wrong with his situation.</p><p></p><p>Being uncontrollable, he couldn't even shout for help.</p><p></p><p>Inside his own personal sanctum, Li Fan didn't need to show his true form to suppress him.</p><p></p><p>Employing the soul-searching technique, Li Fan easily found information about the Lingxu Realm in his mind.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing particularly special about it, just that Liu Yihang had occasionally come across the name of that realm while reading ancient texts.</p><p></p><p>Because there was a plant called the Lingxu Grass in the Lingxu Realm, which was a necessary ingredient for refining the【Nourishing Divine Pill】.</p><p></p><p>So Liu Yihang had once asked Liu San about it.</p><p></p><p>The person involved might have long forgotten about this matter, but thousands of years later, it resulted in an unnecessary calamity.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he could have slept for several more decades in the Grand Dream Spring Array.</p><p></p><p>Having figured out the truth of the matter, Li Fan didn't seem to mind his actions.</p><p></p><p>He continued to keep him suppressed in his sanctum and left for the Medicine King Valley.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, his clone Xu Bai interrupted Liu San's contemplation, "I remember now. I once read a secret scroll that detailed the method of refining the Nourishing Divine Pill."</p><p></p><p>"One of the main ingredients, the Lingxu Grass, seems to grow in the Lingxu Realm. I remember asking you about it back then."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Liu San first looked a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>Then he slapped his head, "Look at my memory, indeed, there was such an incident. I almost forgot about it!"</p><p></p><p>With his internal doubts resolved, Liu San then shifted his focus back to the small world below the Imperial World.</p><p></p><p>Together with Xu Bai, they flew to the front of the tall palace.</p><p></p><p>The powerful divine sense of the Dao expert had already alarmed Xiaoqing.</p><p></p><p>She, along with the Imperial Princess and another woman dressed in red, flew forward to welcome them.</p><p></p><p>"This is our elder from the Alliance, Elder Liu!" Xu Bai introduced solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The three of them bowed in respect to Liu San.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Elder."</p>

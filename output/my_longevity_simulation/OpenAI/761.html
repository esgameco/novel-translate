            <p>However, the original statue thousands of miles away looked directly at its own "True" interface.</p><p></p><p>The upper limit of physiological age did not decrease.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Bai did not believe that Peng Qing's words were unfounded.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Lord of Rebirth initially attained enlightenment in the White Mist.</p><p></p><p>As is widely known, the White Mist named "Element-Eating White Mist" can consume the longevity of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Peng Qing suddenly died a violent death, and the dismal state before his death was almost identical to the cultivators who died in the White Mist.</p><p></p><p>Such things could not be explained as mere coincidences.</p><p></p><p>To prevent the situation from escalating, Xu Bai first used coercion and inducement to silence all the witnesses.</p><p></p><p>Then they sent out cultivators to spread various more bizarre and frightening rumors.</p><p></p><p>For example: In a certain place, a cultivator died in the same miserable manner as Peng Qing, shouting, "The one who destroys the Immortal Alliance is also the Ancestral Lord of Rebirth."</p><p></p><p>Or, Peng Qing was not actually Peng Qing. The real Peng Qing had already died many years ago. The one who died in front of everyone that day was a creation of the Five Elders' Association, a cultivator named "Thousand-Face Demon Ancestor" plotting to create chaos within the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>For a while, various opinions abounded, and the truth was indiscernible.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, although the fervor of the matter did not diminish, there were not many people who cared about the true mad words Peng Qing uttered before his death.</p><p></p><p>Thus, more than ten days passed. New 69 Book Bar → 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Regarding the Peng Qing incident, it was slowly forgotten by everyone. Fewer and fewer people discussed it, and eventually public opinion completely subsided.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the incident had never happened.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai did not disgrace himself, and Nangong Shirong was also very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>In a rare generous move, he rewarded Xu Bai with many merits and contributions.</p><p></p><p>He also handed Xu Bai a statue.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." Xu Bai held the statue in his palm, feeling a mystical sensation.</p><p></p><p>It was like holding another body of his own.</p><p></p><p>"This is the 'Decree of Rebirth.'" Nangong Shirong introduced with a satisfied expression.</p><p></p><p>"I received three of these a while ago. I kept one for backup, and having extras by you is of no use. This time, you have achieved great merit, so I decided to reward you with it."</p><p></p><p>"With this item, even if you unfortunately fall, you can immediately be reincarnated."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai showed a happy expression: "Thank you, sir, for your kindness!"</p><p></p><p>Since the establishment of the Palace of Rebirth, Xu Bai, as a State Messenger, had not heard of the various methods to obtain many treasures in the Palace of Rebirth.</p><p></p><p>Although it was announced to the world that everyone could obtain them as long as they contributed.</p><p></p><p>But the gates of the Palaces of Rebirth in various states remained closed.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention ordinary cultivators, even Xu Bai had no way to enter.</p><p></p><p>Let alone exchange various resources in the Palace of Rebirth.</p><p></p><p>Although many cultivators were dissatisfied, the Palace of Rebirth was not subject to the control of various states. New 89 Book Bar → 89shux.com</p><p></p><p>Excuses were made, stating that various treasures were not ready, sending back any inquiries with great solemnity.</p><p></p><p>With utmost seriousness, Xu Bai put away the "Decree of Rebirth." Before leaving, he suddenly asked: "Sir Nangong, regarding Peng Qing's words before his death, about someone cutting his life..."</p><p></p><p>"Is it true?" Xu Bai lowered his voice.</p><p></p><p>"If it is true, then it can only suppress momentarily, not for a lifetime," he continued.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Shirong fell silent for a moment, shaking his head slightly: "Since everyone can be resurrected, matters of life and death are not that important."</p><p></p><p>"For us, immortality is an unattainable fantasy. In that case, why care about so much?"</p><p></p><p>Nangong Shirong paused, then said, "However, not all cultivators in the world may be as broad-minded as me. Someone will eventually notice this matter. It cannot be suppressed."</p><p></p><p>"What we need to do is make sure this matter does not break out first in our Tianliang Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Shirong spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>His words undoubtedly affirmed the truthfulness of Peng Qing's words before his death.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai remained silent and nodded heavily.</p><p></p><p>As he bid farewell on his way out, thoughts were swirling in Xu Bai's mind: "Cutting his life..."</p><p></p><p>"Is it an incomplete defiance against the Ancestral Lord of Rebirth, completing the necessary means for the rebirth of the true spirit of cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>"Or..."</p><p></p><p>"Is it an intentional imitation of the ancient times?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Lord of Rebirth, from appearing somewhat to formally defying reason, revealed a hint of peculiarity.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestral Lord of Rebirth, taking the place of the Ancient Wood."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai suddenly thought of something, his steps and body froze abruptly.</p><p></p><p>Like the previous Purple Dome Lord, he subtly glanced up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Then he quickly lowered his head without leaving a trace and hurried away.</p><p></p><p>Tianquan Prefecture, Shuofeng Clan.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li?" a voice of surprise came from Shuofeng.</p><p></p><p>In their recent duel, Shuofeng was fully engaged, enjoying the battle.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan suddenly zoned out, and the attacks he could have easily dodged hit him directly.</p><p></p><p>Ferocious sword energy crisscrossed, chopping off Li Fan's lower body into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, it was the New Law Era.</p><p></p><p>This minor injury was inconsequential to Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In just a breath, amidst the faint rumbling in the cave, Li Fan's body rapidly healed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked apologetic: "I've only recently mastered this Life-Cutting Secret Technique, and after battling with Brother Shuofeng day after day, my mind has become somewhat distracted."</p><p></p><p>Only then did Shuofeng realize: "It was my negligence. I got carried away and forgot about this top-notch secret technique, which must have consumed a lot of energy."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, it's my fault for being overly excited. It's been a long time since I encountered such extraordinary skills."</p><p></p><p>"To think even my control over the 'sword' was affected by you..." Shuofeng praised.</p><p></p><p>"You should rest for a moment, Brother Li."</p><p></p><p>With a swift movement, Shuofeng cut off a few strands of the white hair on his head.</p><p></p><p>Then with a shout, his whole body seemed to shed like a snake shedding its skin.</p><p></p><p>The somewhat old and deteriorated appearance of Shuofeng was stripped off like taking off clothes, revealing a young and vigorous version of Shuofeng. He flicked his fingers, turning the old body into ash.</p><p></p><p>He sighed, "Friend, this 'Life-Cutting by Drawing Threads' secret technique of yours is truly extraordinary. In terms of practical combat effectiveness alone, it is the best I have ever seen in my life."</p><p></p><p>"If it were not for my unique constitution, I'm afraid I would not have dared to fight you so recklessly."</p><p></p><p>"If an ordinary cultivator were hit by your secret technique, they would probably die within half a day."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked weary, waved his hand, and said, "Let's not dwell on it. Although I created it with painstaking effort, it's a pity it can't keep up with the changes of the times."</p><p></p><p>"Now with the Palace of Rebirth standing tall and everyone capable of resurrection, my technique, while powerful, has weakened several times over in terms of intimidation. Anyway, with the ability to resurrect, what does it matter if the body is deteriorated?"</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng shook his head, "Brother Li, don't be modest. With rebirth and resurrection..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph."</p><p></p><p>"Real strong figures of the day will undoubtedly pay attention to your technique. With just this move, you have surpassed countless self-proclaimed heroes in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Well, it's time to give you a better treatment. But being a junior offering is a bit unfair to you."</p>

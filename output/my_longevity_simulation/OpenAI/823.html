        <h1>Chapter 823</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Ji Shaoli is causing a disturbance by concealing the other party's swallowing of the fairyland.</p><p></p><p>After all, this place belongs to the territory of the Wanxian Alliance, and it is currently a tense moment in the battle. Although he and Pei Tuo are indeed both members of the Wanxian Alliance, it is still better to be cautious and avoid trouble.</p><p></p><p>Similar to the process of Li Fan swallowing the Five Elements Fairyland.</p><p></p><p>From the Golden Elixir, the fierce roots of heaven and earth crazily surged out.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of tentacles, conscious, rooted into various places of the Qianyan fairyland.</p><p></p><p>Entwined, tightly locked.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the entire fairyland was shrouded inside.</p><p></p><p>The fairyland roared, turning into strands of light particles, merging into Pei Tuo's body.</p><p></p><p>This process lasted for a full three days.</p><p></p><p>After three days, Pei Tuo suddenly reappeared in the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>The aura belonging to the Yuanying stage surged, restless for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Long trapped in the Golden Elixir, breaking through in a sudden, Pei Tuo was about to roar long and express the joy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, he was reminded by Ji Shaoli's cold voice to come back to reality: "Let's go, don't linger."</p><p></p><p>Pei Tuo's breath suddenly stagnated.</p><p></p><p>Although he had now surpassed the other party by one realm, he did not dare to underestimate Ji Shaoli in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Behind that "Mutual Aid Club" is definitely a terrifying force! Playing with his little Yuanying would surely be a piece of cake.</p><p></p><p>So Pei Tuo obediently followed Ji Shaoli, returning low-key and quickly to the Congyuan Sea.</p><p></p><p>And the people like Xiang Xin from the Mutual Aid Club, seeing that Pei Tuo had already reached the Yuanying stage, were greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>They finally confirmed that what Ji Shaoli said was not false.</p><p></p><p>Some regretted why they were not the first to join, and the look in their eyes towards Ji Shaoli gradually became fervent.</p><p></p><p>After some hesitation, Xiang Xin couldn't resist the temptation and asked, "Friend Ji, when we break through in the future, will the organization..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli smiled and interrupted him.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, you, as the first batch of elders of the Congyuan Sea Mutual Aid Club, as soon as your realm reaches the required level, you will immediately be assigned an ownerless fairyland! So your most important task at the moment is still to practice hard and quickly improve your cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>His words instantly gave the people present boundless motivation.</p><p></p><p>They all immediately returned to the Wanxian Island Xuanjing Mirror and began practicing tirelessly, regardless of cost.</p><p></p><p>And when news of Pei Tuo's breakthrough spread, it caused great shock among the cultivators who had attended the feast that day.</p><p></p><p>For a time, there was a continuous stream of cultivators visiting Haixuan Island, wanting to join the Congyuan Sea Mutual Aid Club.</p><p></p><p>However, Ji Shaoli chose to remain closed and unseen.</p><p></p><p>"The law must not be taken lightly."</p><p></p><p>He looked outside the "Eight Extremities Dragon-Annihilating Formation of the Great Wilderness," smiled faintly at the various expressions of the cultivators, and completely ignored their calls, focusing on trading goods in the Tianxuan Mirror Market.</p><p></p><p>Although six million contribution points seemed like a lot, it was still not enough.</p><p></p><p>Before the development of the Mutual Aid Club, he needed to earn more back.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Just as Pei Tuo officially broke through to the Yuanying stage.</p><p></p><p>A huge feedback of cultivation suddenly emerged from Li Fan's dantian for no reason.</p><p></p><p>Instantly absorbed by Li Fan, it propelled his mid-Golden Elixir cultivation forward by a large margin.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed useful! Using the non-existent 'Red Dust Compassionate True Immortal' as a medium, the ultimate beneficiary is still me!" Li Fan took a deep breath, his eyes shining.</p><p></p><p>The key lies in the so-called membership oath.</p><p></p><p>The oath essentially requires all the brothers in the Mutual Aid Club, under the witness of the Compassionate True Immortal, to help and love each other. All the conveniences provided by the Mutual Aid Club come from the blessings of the Compassionate True Immortal. Members must always remember this.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that I will return to the Yuanying stage soon."</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know if the Wanxian Alliance has discovered the Five Elements Grand Fairyland at this time."</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation, Li Fan summoned Tianyang and asked him to go to Tianlingzhou to investigate for himself.</p><p></p><p>"Just gather information, prioritize your own safety," Li Fan instructed.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang nodded suddenly, transformed into a stream of light, and flew out of the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>"With Tianyang's strength, even if discovered, it shouldn't be a problem to escape."</p><p></p><p>"But the Nascent Divinity cultivation is still not quite enough. After I return to the Yuanying stage, maybe I can consider assisting him in the Dao."</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation, he locked onto his target.</p><p></p><p>The soul of heaven and earth can almost be considered equivalent to a Dao-invested cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Considering that the former was just a furnace worker, it even pushed some of the Nascent Divinity cultivators of the Congyuan Sea to go all out before they barely defeated him.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, the entire merging process needs to be carried out silently, without attracting the attention of other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, one might end up unwittingly setting up someone else for success.</p><p></p><p>Even with Li Fan's help, Tianyang would probably still struggle a bit.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but think of the three members of the Medicine King Sect.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that it will take some time for the Medicine King True Cauldron to return."</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was contemplating where to find some help.</p><p></p><p>A change suddenly occurred in the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, after months of hard work by Shang Tianci, the Spirit Wood Realm had undergone a drastic transformation.</p><p></p><p>Countless magnificent scenes adorned various places in the Spirit Wood Realm. The ethereal spiritual energy connected the earth veins below to the sky above.</p><p></p><p>As if all were connected.</p><p></p><p>The whole world seemed to be undergoing a wonderful transformation, and the most obvious and beneficial part of it was, of course, the central spirit tree in the world.</p><p></p><p>In a short period of time, it had grown nearly a third taller, radiating a fresh vitality.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like something was gestating.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Li Fan instantly locked onto the source of the anomaly through the Spirit Wood Heart.</p><p></p><p>It was in the center of the spirit tree, in the space where the tree people were originally nurtured.</p><p></p><p>Countless green light spots gathered to form a humanoid figure.</p><p></p><p>"What is thisâ€¦" Li Fan couldn't help but narrow his eyes, flashed over, and came nearby.</p><p></p><p>The chief of the tree people hurried over at this time.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the humanoid figure that was becoming clearer and clearer nearby, first stunned, then seemed to recall something.</p><p></p><p>She suddenly became somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this is the 'Spirit of the Tree!'" She took the initiative to explain to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After the explanation of the female chieftain of the tree people, Li Fan also understood what the so-called 'Tree Spirit' truly was.</p><p></p><p>If tree people are born from the spirit tree as guards.</p><p></p><p>Then the targets they need to protect are meant to guard the spirit tree until it gains its own spiritual wisdom.</p><p></p><p>As opposed to forcibly refining the Spirit Wood Heart and seizing it, the Tree Spirit seems more like the true master of the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, a fully bare body appeared in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The aura emanating from it was gradually strengthening.</p>

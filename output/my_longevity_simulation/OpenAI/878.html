        <h1>Chapter 878</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the face of an absolute gap in power, all struggles and resistance are futile!</p><p></p><p>All living beings within a province, including the cultivators stationed by the Five Elders Association, the followers of the Lingyuan Sect, and numerous ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>All perished at the moment when the eyes of the Supreme Heaven Master opened.</p><p></p><p>It was like the mysterious Yellow Realm, unable to withstand the direct gaze of a true immortal.</p><p></p><p>The living beings of the Nine Mountain Provinces also couldn't face the might of the Supreme Heaven Master!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless cultivators died.</p><p></p><p>Originally, there should have been countless visions of falling in the sky.</p><p></p><p>But perhaps it was because the figure of the Supreme Heaven Master did not dissipate.</p><p></p><p>Under the pressure, those visions of falling failed to materialize.</p><p></p><p>This scene was as if even the laws of the mysterious Yellow Realm in front of the Supreme Heaven Master had converged, not daring to mock or celebrate the deaths of the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The scene provided by the Five Elders Association abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Although it was indeed somewhat shocking.</p><p></p><p>But for Li Fan, who had already witnessed the scene of a true immortal destroying the world...</p><p></p><p>It was nothing.</p><p></p><p>After contemplating it repeatedly, Li Fan immediately noticed something amiss.</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Heaven Master? The Thirty-Three Immortal Selects?"</p><p></p><p>During the 115th era, the Supreme Heaven Master had once revealed her true form.</p><p></p><p>The entirety of the mysterious Yellow Realm trembled under her might.</p><p></p><p>As if the end of the world was imminent, ready to be completely torn apart by her power.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, the appearance of the Supreme Heaven Master in the Nine Mountain Provinces this time was weaker than before.</p><p></p><p>"What is this, a projection? A clone?"</p><p></p><p>A glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>In his perception, Wei Qi, one of the immortal selects, was still alive.</p><p></p><p>And the cultivators of the Five Elders Association had mentioned earlier that she, as the projected form of the Supreme Heaven Master, might appear more frequently in the future.</p><p></p><p>This proved that it was not a one-time consumption method, but a continuously reproducible operation.</p><p></p><p>"Although her power is far inferior to the true form of the Supreme Heaven Master, she is definitely a combat force in the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>"More importantly, it is not clear how the projection of the Supreme Heaven Master appeared in the sky above the Nine Mountain Provinces. Throughout, those immortal selects did not appear. If the projection of the Supreme Heaven Master can be summoned without location restrictions..."</p><p></p><p>"Then the intimidation would be too great. Before finding a way to deal with it, the Five Elders Association would never dare to act recklessly."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze flickered as he surveyed the area of the Nine Mountain Provinces he was in.</p><p></p><p>Countless living beings had perished here not long ago. But what was peculiar was that there was not even a hint of the smell of blood.</p><p></p><p>After all, under the pressure of the Supreme Heaven Master, the blood had been obliterated.</p><p></p><p>"It is worthy of being a method formed in the image of the Supreme Heaven Master. Rather than calling it slaughter, it's more like destruction."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Understanding what had happened in the Nine Mountain Provinces, Li Fan did not linger here.</p><p></p><p>Quickly returning through the power of the earth veins.</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, next, if the Five Elders Association wants to counterattack, they will likely use the 'Universal Virtuous True Boat' and launch a surprise attack in the white mist."</p><p></p><p>"As long as they start a battle in the territory of the Immortal Alliance, even if the Immortal Alliance wants to use the projection of the Supreme Heaven Master, they will surely be cautious."</p><p></p><p>"However, such a trick is most effective the first time. The Five Elders Association would probably plan to use it at a pivotal moment..."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting. Let's see how the Five Elders Association chooses."</p><p></p><p>The intimidation of the projection of the Supreme Heaven Master was indeed formidable.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was only used once in the Nine Mountain Provinces, it frightened the members of the Five Elders Association in the borderlands who had fallen into chaos, causing them to shrink their forces.</p><p></p><p>With little effort, the Immortal Alliance swiftly reclaimed several border regions that had been previously lost.</p><p></p><p>The news spread like wildfire, making the cultivators accustomed to the Immortal Alliance being disadvantaged unable to believe it.</p><p></p><p>As a result, conspiracy theories unexpectedly began to circulate in various places.</p><p></p><p>In the Clouds and Sea, on Hailuan Island.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Alliance's speed in reclaiming lost territories is also too fast. Do you think there is something fishy about this?"</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, I heard a piece of gossip. It is said that these several provinces were not actually conquered by our Immortal Alliance but intentionally returned by the Five Elders Association!"</p><p></p><p>"It was hard-won. How could the Five Elders Association willingly give up like that?"</p><p></p><p>"Hiss! I understand! This is a trick by the Five Elders Association. After the lost territories are subdued, they will have to be rebuilt anyway, right? When we have worked hard to build it, the Five Elders Association will come back again! Then it will be looted again..."</p><p></p><p>"I see, why are we suddenly getting bold. So that's it!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Conspiracy theories always find favor among the masses.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't accept the usual "weak" Immortal Alliance achieving such brilliant results in a short period.</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators began to speculate on possible conspiracies involved.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were discussing with some joy, they unknowingly offended two people.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>A loud sound of slamming the table suddenly rang out, and a figure stood up abruptly.</p><p></p><p>"I originally thought that the Clouds and Sea Mutual Aid Association was well-known far and wide, surely a remarkable organization."</p><p></p><p>"But I didn't expect that its internal members would be so despicable!"</p><p></p><p>The person glanced around at the group of cultivators present, saying coldly, "Many colleagues have lost their lives on the front lines even as the battle has not yet ceased. You people here are useless, but still gossiping behind others' backs!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm Kou Hong, ashamed to associate with you!"</p><p></p><p>"Disgusting!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong glared, his voice like thunder.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, another slender figure in white stood up, with starry eyes and sword-like brows, and laughed loudly, "My brother speaks well. I, Dao Xuanzi, also look down on these beasts!"</p><p></p><p>The words of the two immediately offended the previous small group.</p><p></p><p>They looked coldly at Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi, a trace of killing intent flashing in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps if this wasn't Ji Shaoli's territory, they would have immediately taken the lives of these two outspoken cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of mutual aid association is this? Better not wait!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi were angry and about to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a minute!" Suddenly, someone stopped them.</p><p></p><p>Everyone took a closer look and bowed one after another.</p><p></p><p>It turned out to be the master of Hailuan Island, the chief organizer of the Clouds and Sea Mutual Aid Association, Ji Shaoli, who had come in person!</p><p></p><p>"Friend Ji, they say that people with different paths cannot cooperate. Let's part ways here today!" Kou Hong turned his head without paying attention to Ji Shaoli. However, Dao Xuanzi still had some politeness and said with a bow.</p><p></p><p>The clone of Ji Shaoli did not speak, just looked at these two familiar faces, a hint of a smile playing at the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but sigh in his heart: "Fate, inexplicable!"</p><p></p><p>Watching the two who originally, in the historical timeline, until decades later, only had a foundation-building cultivation, but were already in the early stage of the Golden Core realm.</p>

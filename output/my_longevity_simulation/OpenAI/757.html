        <h1>Chapter 757</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"When the time comes, who knows what kind of monster might be created."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid that even if Yushan and I join forces, we may not be able to suppress it."</p><p></p><p>Liu San shook his head slightly, "Like a poison, very effective, but unfortunately, there are too many restrictions."</p><p></p><p>"If only we could control the power of Heda warriors," Liu San suddenly sighed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's eyes narrowed, his expression unchanged. Following his words, he pondered, "Liu Lao's words make sense. In today's Xuanhuang realm, there are all kinds of strange creatures. There may actually exist a way to control the Heda practitioners."</p><p></p><p>"I'll go find out. If it's true, then wouldn't our Medicine King Sect be able to produce a Heda warrior on a regular basis?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Liu San couldn't help but feel excited.</p><p></p><p>"Although the killing power of this fusion beast may not be as strong as the new Heda, it is still at the Heda level. If we have enough of them, even if the Wuxian Alliance wants to target us, they will surely hesitate, right?"</p><p></p><p>"By then, perhaps our Medicine King Sect could reappear openly in the world?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai agreed, "It's not impossible to plan for it."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Young Master, Elder Ruan is still sleeping in the Medicine King's True Cauldron. He has done some research on the bodies of the demon beasts. Why not wake him up, maybe he can find a solution." Liu San suggested.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The memories of Liu Yihang instantly flashed through Xu Bai's mind.</p><p></p><p>Ruan Tianshao, one of the Heda elders of the Medicine King Sect.</p><p></p><p>Unlike other elders who used spiritual plants in medicine, Ruan Tianshao preferred to use animals, demon beasts, and human body tissues in his medicine.</p><p></p><p>While the effects were indeed extraordinary, the bloody and murderous aura was too strong, and it had a somewhat shocking meaning.</p><p></p><p>So, Ruan Tianshao's "fleshy pills" were not accepted by the public.</p><p></p><p>He was also relatively reclusive, usually solitary within the Medicine King Sect, without any close relationships.</p><p></p><p>After much thought, Xu Bai frowned and decided, "Elder Ruan has never gotten along well with others. I fear that if he wakes up and suddenly learns that he has traveled thousands of years into the future, he may not necessarily have the same thoughts for our Medicine King Sect."</p><p></p><p>Liu San could not deny this, "There is a possibility."</p><p></p><p>"However, Elder Ruan's art of fleshy pills indeed has some unique aspects. The Fusion Beast..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai seemed to be hesitant, "Let's do this, let's wait until we officially acquire the Imperial Technology and then decide based on the specific situation."</p><p></p><p>"If we can mass-produce Fusion Beasts just by ourselves, then there is no need to hurry to wake Elder Ruan. If we encounter any difficulties, it's not too late to wake him up then."</p><p></p><p>In the end, Xu Bai said so.</p><p></p><p>Liu San also nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>With the interlude over, Xu Bai still had to return to Tianliang Prefecture. Liu San also had to return to the Medicine King Valley.</p><p></p><p>After the two separated, Xu Bai looked in the direction where Liu San had disappeared, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a test? Or just a coincidence?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's because of what happened before, he has noticed something. After all, even for Heda practitioners, although they cannot resist the changes brought by the True Inducement of the Heavenly Sovereign, they can still possibly perceive their own abnormal conditions."</p><p></p><p>"Just to be safe, it's better for this Daoist to leave the Changsheng Valley first."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had always been decisive.</p><p></p><p>At this thought, without any hesitation, this Daoist left the Medicine King Valley before Liu San returned.</p><p></p><p>"It would be best to ask some people from the Five Elders Association to confirm the effectiveness of this True Inducement." A gleam of light flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He temporarily put away the Defragmentation Disk and headed straight for the residence of Suofeng.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Xu Bai, who was returning to Tianliang Prefecture, secretly found the spy from the Guarding Academy with whom he had dealt with earlier, a spy from the Five Elders Association named Liu Wenyu.</p><p></p><p>"Liu Daoist, I heard that you haven't generated your own Tianxuan Treasure Mirror yet?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai first asked in this manner.</p><p></p><p>A shadow of unease passed over Liu Wenyu's face, but he did not utter anything out of line.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he hinted, "Soon. Although there are still many practitioners in the Immortal Alliance who are hesitant about the existence of the Tianxuan Treasure Mirror and are reluctant to generate it."</p><p></p><p>"But it is said that the official decision has been made. All members within the Immortal Alliance system must generate the treasure mirror within their bodies. We, the Guarding Academy practitioners, must be the first to complete this. This is just the first step."</p><p></p><p>"I believe that soon, the day when every practitioner carries a treasure mirror will come."</p><p></p><p>"Humph, by then..."</p><p></p><p>A hint of uncontrollable fear flashed in Liu Wenyu's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I don't see any problem with it, this item is indeed extraordinary. With it, many troubles can be avoided," Xu Bai smiled slightly, indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Have you already generated it?" Liu Wenyu's face changed, as if about to retreat.</p><p></p><p>But he was grabbed by Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>The Defragmentation Disk appeared, emitting a faint white light that enveloped the two.</p><p></p><p>"What 'Futian Club'? I don't understand what you are saying," Liu Wenyu's face turned pale and he shook his head hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>Dismissing Xu Bai's control, he tried to escape.</p><p></p><p>But upon hearing Xu Bai's words, he suddenly stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>"I've made it clear, haven't you figured it out yet? As a spy of the Five Elders Association, your sense of smell is not very sensitive." Xu Bai shook his head slightly, "Just say it, our Futian Alliance possesses a method to shield the surveillance of the Tianxuan Treasure Mirror."</p><p></p><p>Although his tone was calm, to Liu Wenyu's ears, it was nothing short of thunder.</p><p></p><p>"It's impossible! Absolutely impossible!" He blurted out, "We are completely helpless..."</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu's words abruptly stopped, his face turning ashen, "Are you deceiving me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai chuckled softly, "If what I said is false, then I'm sure that before long, people from the Immortal Alliance and the Guarding Academy will rush over to deal with us."</p><p></p><p>"Liu Daoist might as well be patient. Anyway, now that things have come to this point, you won't be able to escape. Just a moment longer with me."</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu's expression kept changing, but eventually, he retracted his steps and sat down in the room.</p><p></p><p>Anxiously, he waited.</p><p></p><p>Time passed slowly, every moment seeming like an eternity to him.</p><p></p><p>But after most of the day had passed, there was still no movement outside.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu became increasingly suspicious, looking up at the "Defragmentation Disk" hovering above them, his eyes showing an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Can this thing really shield the sense of the Tianxuan Treasure Mirror?" His face was full of shock.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Futian Alliance just a name?" Xu Bai said calmly.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>There is a popular vote for a well-recognized scene, everyone please vote for the Sky Doctor.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Doctor appreciates everyone's support!</p>

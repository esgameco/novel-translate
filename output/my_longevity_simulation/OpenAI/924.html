        <h1>Chapter 924</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Huo Jingtong was extremely upset. </p><p></p><p>Before leaving, she had reminded and instructed him a thousand times to behave himself. </p><p></p><p>She never expected this culprit not only did not listen to her, but instead became even more violent, causing harm to all the disciples on Liuyue Peak! </p><p></p><p>If this were to get out... </p><p></p><p>Thinking about the consequences of this matter being revealed, Huo Jingtong's vision darkened. </p><p></p><p>"I can no longer tolerate him; I must give him a harsh lesson!" </p><p></p><p>With this thought in mind, Huo Jingtong condensed one-tenth of her full power into a moonlight beam in her right hand and aimed it at Li Qing. </p><p></p><p>The moment she acted, Huo Jingtong already regretted it. </p><p></p><p>After all, she was a cultivated deity, and even with only one-tenth of her power, it was not something Li Qing, who had just entered the Yuan Ying stage, could resist. </p><p></p><p>If she were to injure him... </p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong was already contemplating reducing the force when something that shook her immensely happened. </p><p></p><p>A crescent moon rose behind Li Qing, turning his already extraordinary appearance into that resembling a celestial being. </p><p></p><p>And the moonlight beam sent out by Huo Jingtong was effortlessly blocked by Li Qing! </p><p></p><p>"How is this possible! With half of the moon revealed, this is the sign of mastering 【Transforming Moonlight】, only achievable in the later stages of Yuan Ying! How long was I gone for?" With a mixture of astonishment and joy in her heart, Huo Jingtong's blood surged. </p><p></p><p>Stimulating her internal injuries, her face suddenly turned pale, and a mouthful of blood spurted out. </p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Qing quickly dashed to Huo Jingtong's side and held her shoulder, showing worry and concern, saying, "Master, how did you get injured? Let me heal you!" </p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I am a deity cultivator; I don't need..." Huo Jingtong's words were cut off with a groan as she was forced to stop. </p><p></p><p>Feeling the pure Yin energy coming from Li Qing's warm palm, Huo Jingtong suddenly felt as if her body was crawling with ants, but as a deity cultivator, she quickly suppressed the strange feeling in her heart. Instead, she was more amazed by the pure energy continuously flowing from her disciple into her body. </p><p></p><p>This influx of pure Yin energy seemed to be a catalyst, stirring up waves of her moonlight power. After a tumultuous entanglement, the pure Yin energy completely merged into her majestic moonlight power. </p><p></p><p>The moonlight power that Huo Jingtong had thought was close to perfection, after this fusion, became even purer and even carried a subtle aura of profound mysteriousness! </p><p></p><p>This was a sign of breaking through to the Harmonious Path realm! </p><p></p><p>Words could not describe the shock and confusion in Huo Jingtong's heart at this moment. </p><p></p><p>Even a thought emerged in her mind that it would be great if Li Qing's supply of pure Yin energy never stopped. </p><p></p><p>Amidst the interplay of these two forces and the gradual rise of her stagnant cultivation, Huo Jingtong's mind slowly became lost. </p><p></p><p>She had lost track of time when Li Qing released his palms from supporting her back. </p><p></p><p>"Master..." </p><p></p><p>Seeing Huo Jingtong a bit dazed, he called out softly. </p><p></p><p>Coming back to her senses, a blush quickly rose to Huo Jingtong's cheeks. </p><p></p><p>"I'm fine now, you should leave first," she said in a fluster. </p><p></p><p>"That makes me feel relieved." Letting out a sigh of relief, Li Qing bowed and left. </p><p></p><p>Watching Li Qing quickly retreat, a hint of annoyance surfaced in Huo Jingtong's heart. </p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>From that day onwards, there was a different kind of emotion between the master and disciple. </p><p></p><p>But Li Qing did not directly confront it, and he always maintained a respectful and obedient image in front of Huo Jingtong. </p><p></p><p>However, behind the scenes, his actions causing chaos on Liuyue Peak never stopped. </p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong's spiritual awareness enveloped the entire mountain, capturing everything that was happening within. </p><p></p><p>Although still absurd in principle, it was too late to change the situation. Should she really have to exterminate all the disciples under her sect? </p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Qing did not lie. Under the influence of the miraculous pure Yin energy, the progress of the disciples' strength was obvious to all. </p><p></p><p>Therefore, Huo Jingtong had to back down and let Li Qing do as he pleased. </p><p></p><p>And in order to prevent other practitioners from the peaks discovering, she even actively set up arrays to conceal it. </p><p></p><p>Under the nourishment of the reverse Yin energy, the disciples of Liuyue Peak enjoyed happiness and significant progress in their cultivation. </p><p></p><p>Only Huo Jingtong herself did not benefit from this. </p><p></p><p>And Li Qing seemed to have no thoughts regarding his master at all, behaving extremely upright and proper. </p><p></p><p>Two years passed in the blink of an eye. </p><p></p><p>On the peak of Liuyue, inside a secluded room. </p><p></p><p>"Over two years, it's time to break through to the Harmonious Path." </p><p></p><p>"Such a speed of cultivation is unheard of." </p><p></p><p>"If he successfully breaks through, won't his cultivation be on par with mine? If he insists on..." </p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong's mind was in chaos. </p><p></p><p>At that moment, a strong wind blew, and a majestic aura emanated from Li Qing before suddenly disappearing. </p><p></p><p>"He really succeeded?!" Huo Jingtong watched Li Qing, her mind bewildered. </p><p></p><p>"Thank you for protecting me, Master!" Li Qing bowed and expressed his gratitude, maintaining a polite demeanor. </p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong, however, turned away, avoiding Li Qing's bow. </p><p></p><p>According to the rules of Daoist sects, if a disciple's cultivation matches or surpasses their master's, they can be considered equals. </p><p></p><p>Of course, if respect for the master is upheld, it doesn't matter who is stronger. The master-disciple relationship can still be maintained. </p><p></p><p>Li Qing smiled faintly, saying, "Even if I achieve eternal life one day, in my heart, you will always be my master. The only master." </p><p></p><p>At his words, Huo Jingtong's body trembled slightly. </p><p></p><p>Looking at Li Qing's sincere expression, she couldn't help but feel touched. </p><p></p><p>"Let's go. With another deity cultivator on Liuyue Peak, such a big event should be shared with others as soon as possible." Li Qing approached and gently held Huo Jingtong's flawless hand. </p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong symbolically resisted for a moment before giving in. </p><p></p><p>On Liuyue Peak, a night of joy ensued. </p><p></p><p>As emotions deepened, Huo Jingtong eventually couldn't resist. </p><p></p><p>At night, after everyone had fallen asleep deeply, Li Qing, feeling a massive Yin energy never experienced before from Huo Jingtong's body, nodded in satisfaction. </p><p></p><p>"The feedback from a deity cultivator is truly extraordinary." </p><p></p><p>"This immense Yin element is sufficient to support my rapid cultivation in the deity realm for a period of time." </p><p></p><p>"However, it's not enough!" </p><p></p><p>With his strength skyrocketing, Li Qing's ambitions swelled even further. </p><p></p><p>He began to focus his attention on other female cultivators from the Moonlight lineage. </p><p></p><p>"Only the Distinguished Immortal realm is my ultimate pursuit." </p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, Li Qing's shadow was nowhere to be seen. </p><p></p><p>Only his face remained concealed in the night, leaving his true intentions a mystery. </p><p></p><p>The next day, Huo Jingtong woke up and immediately brought Li Qing into seclusion. </p><p></p><p>The bottleneck that had plagued and troubled her for many years had loosened slightly under last night's impact. </p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong sensed that her advancement to the Harmonious Path was not far off.</p>

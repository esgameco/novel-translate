        <h1>Chapter 982</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"After all, my undercover identity is top secret, only the elders know."</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou couldn't help but feel a little proud, a hint of a smile appeared on his face as he welcomed Shang Tianci.</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci tightly held Yan Fangzhou's hands, looking him up and down. At the same time, he kept muttering to himself, "It's good as long as everything is fine."</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Shang Tianci felt a bit guilty for luring Yan Fangzhou to the Lingmu Realm and subjecting him to confinement and torture.</p><p></p><p>But due to the coercion of Li Fan, Shang Tianci didn't dare to voice any opposition. He could only hope that Yan Fangzhou would see the situation clearly and turn back soon.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Li Fan's training of Yan Fangzhou had been quite successful.</p><p></p><p>"Before I came, the elders instructed me. The past is in the past, let's try not to bring it up again. From today onwards, Fangzhou and I are both brothers of the Alliance." Thinking like this, Shang Tianci and Yan Fangzhou exchanged a smile.</p><p></p><p>Everything was understood without words.</p><p></p><p>Under Shang Tianci's guidance, Yan Fangzhou toured the entire Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Alliance is truly changing rapidly. Compared to that, the Ten Immortal League seems rather outdated."</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou watched the continuous release of spiritual energy from the "Heaven and Earth Furnace" not far away, a hint of strangeness flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci also sighed, saying, "Indeed, in just a few years, the Lingmu Realm has undergone such drastic changes..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps choosing to join the Alliance back then was the most correct decision I've made in my life."</p><p></p><p>The two of them shared a mutual feeling.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a thought arose in both of their minds: "Why not persuade the other brothers of the 'Mountain and River Pavilion' to follow the right path?"</p><p></p><p>"The Alliance's counterattack against the Xuanhuang Realm is the general trend. We can't let them waste their time in the Ten Immortal League."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Alliance is currently in a rapid growth phase. Those who join now will be prominent figures in the future. If we wait a few more years, they may not have the chance to join."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The two brothers agreed and began to plan together.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan, who had observed all their actions, just smiled faintly. These arrogant youths from the Ten Immortal League within the Mountain and River Pavilion still had some use for him.</p><p></p><p>Deriving the method of the "Primordial Golden Pill" and the subsequent techniques, it truly required extraordinary talents.</p><p></p><p>"I don't need to achieve everything in one lifetime, as long as I can push progress, that is victory."</p><p></p><p>"My lord..." Li Fan was thinking like this when suddenly Lin Ling's voice rang in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The voice was somewhat anxious and hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, come to the secret chamber to see me."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Ling's figure appeared in front of Li Fan and knelt down respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Your heart seems a bit wavering and restless," Li Fan sat cross-legged, closing his eyes, and calmly said.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling pressed her lips together, wanting to speak but hesitating.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was her thoughts or her expression, they were much richer than when she was first created.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chuckled, "You were born to be obedient to the strong. When you were ignorant and unreasonable before, it was insignificant to acknowledge me as your master. But now, after experiencing the world, many dissatisfactions and resentments have emerged in your heart. Isn't that true?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling trembled, quickly bowed again, repeatedly saying she dared not.</p><p></p><p>Only she knew what the actual situation was.</p><p></p><p>During the time outside the Lingmu Realm, Lin Ling learned from the ancient tree predecessors she encountered about their dissatisfaction with her acknowledging Li Fan as her master.</p><p></p><p>Though they did not directly incite Lin Ling to betray, they transmitted many images from the memories of the ancient trees, leading to rapid growth in Lin Ling's "mind."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Lin Ling's mind was in turmoil, wanting to leave Li Fan's side to explore the wider world. However, upon returning to the Lingmu Realm and witnessing the various changes in the world, a sudden sense of alertness towards betraying Li Fan emerged in her heart.</p><p></p><p>It seemed...</p><p></p><p>If she truly betrayed him, a great disaster might befall her.</p><p></p><p>The world of creation and spirits was the most accurate of all. The persistent alertness made Lin Ling feel as if she had been constantly surrounded by the watchful eyes of natural enemies these days, making her restless.</p><p></p><p>Unable to bear it any longer, she prepared to confess everything to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Just as she was about to speak, Li Fan laughed lightly, "You silly child..."</p><p></p><p>"Nevermind, today I will show you what true power is."</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling froze, looking up abruptly.</p><p></p><p>She felt an unimaginably powerful aura bursting from her master's body, even though he was only in the Yuanying Realm. His pressure was enough to oppress even Lin Ling, who was in the cohesion realm.</p><p></p><p>"Realm does not signify everything. If I wanted to kill you, it would be as simple as crushing an ant."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's voice suddenly sounded in Lin Ling's mind.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling felt as if his hand lightly pressed against her head.</p><p></p><p>As if her fate had been seized, Lin Ling's body stiffened, unable to move at all.</p><p></p><p>And it was not achieved through the control of her heart of wood, but through actual overpowering strength!</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling was shocked to the core, finding it difficult to imagine how the golden core cultivator of the past had suddenly become so powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that my master has been pretending all along?"</p><p></p><p>As this thought crossed Lin Ling's mind, an even colder chill ran through her.</p><p></p><p>Under the pressure of life and death, there was no hint of resistance in her heart.</p><p></p><p>After what seemed like a long time, Li Fan finally released his hand, resuming his cross-legged position in front of her in the void.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling immediately slumped to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Then she struggled to get up, kneeling and begging for forgiveness from Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>She detailed the entire process of how she developed contrary thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"The Earth Vein Ancient Tree..." A glint of coldness flickered in Li Fan's eyes as he made a mental note of it.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that you still have more to say?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling's body trembled again at Li Fan's words.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my lord. But this is just my speculation, it may not be true."</p><p></p><p>"But go ahead." </p><p></p><p>Lin Ling hesitated for a moment, then gritted her teeth and said, "I suspect that Senior Shiban was dragged away by an unknown force from the fishing pond. It's very likely that Luli is secretly passing information!"</p><p></p><p>"What?" Even Li Fan was somewhat surprised by this statement.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling explained softly, "I wasn't completely sure. I thought Luli kept pulling me closer to the fishing pond just to gain some benefits from Senior Shiban."</p><p></p><p>"But on the day of the incident, when Senior Shiban was suddenly dragged forward, Luli's face showed no fear or shock."</p><p></p><p>"It was as if she already knew this scene would happen."</p><p></p><p>"Although she quickly reacted and showed a scared look afterward, that momentary change did not escape my observation."</p><p></p><p>"This young Luli definitely has something fishy about her!"</p>

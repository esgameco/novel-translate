        <h1>Chapter 867</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan sighed a little in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he shouldn't have overlooked this.</p><p></p><p>But due to first obtaining a precious treasure and then succeeding in a breakthrough, his mentality became somewhat unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>Thus, this unusual aspect was neglected.</p><p></p><p>"However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. At the very least, I've learned that the Rainbow Divine Light cannot be easily activated and also attracted this venerable elder."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan calmly looked towards the scholar with stone tablets behind him.</p><p></p><p>In the surging earth veins, the scholar walked alongside ordinary people, neither fast nor slow.</p><p></p><p>And the earth vein ancient trees that would normally launch attacks on cultivators intruding within showed no signs of disturbance at this moment.</p><p></p><p>It was unusually calm.</p><p></p><p>Even Lin Ling's calling went unanswered.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan cursed inwardly and urged Lin Ling to continue hurrying on their way.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Nine Mountain Province.</p><p></p><p>At the previous meeting point.</p><p></p><p>Not long after Li Fan and the scholar left together, a cultivator dressed in the attire of the Five Elders Guild arrived late.</p><p></p><p>Having waited for a long time without seeing anyone appear, he couldn't help but be puzzled.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Yongyun Province.</p><p></p><p>In a mountain temple, outside a fishing pond.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please look." Li Fan respectfully pointed towards the small pond in front and spoke.</p><p></p><p>Because Ji Shao Li had informed in advance before they arrived, Zhong Shentong already knew that someone would come.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the stone tablet scholar and Li Fan, hardly daring to breathe.</p><p></p><p>He held Lüli behind him, firmly preventing her from trying to peek out.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet scholar showed some interest as he examined for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"It's just an ordinary small pond..."</p><p></p><p>"Could there be anything mystical about it?"</p><p></p><p>The scholar's interest was piqued.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan signaled Zhong Shentong to step forward and demonstrate.</p><p></p><p>"I've already used up today's chance." Zhong Shentong said somewhat helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan had no choice but to personally take action.</p><p></p><p>He sat by the edge of the pond in a serious manner.</p><p></p><p>With a fishing rod in hand.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a strange color burst in the eyes of the stone tablet scholar.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan returned after fishing and checked the white light ball in his hand, everything suddenly became clear to him.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>Eager to try it for himself, Li Fan was about to remind them of the correct way to use the fishing pond.</p><p></p><p>But the stone tablet scholar pondered for a moment, then his figure transformed in an instant!</p><p></p><p>The owner of that appearance was very familiar to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than the eccentric old fisherman!</p><p></p><p>Yet, the fishing basket on his back had been replaced with a heavy blue stone tablet!</p><p></p><p>"I forgot to tell you. This scholar is not my original appearance."</p><p></p><p>"But an imitation of the Five Elders Guild member."</p><p></p><p>The 'Fisherman' smiled, humming something as he cast his rod.</p><p></p><p>His expression and posture were almost indistinguishable from the real fisherman.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>In his previous encounter, he had underestimated this strong Immortal Being.</p><p></p><p>After all, the monitoring function of the Primordial Stone Tablet only worked in certain areas.</p><p></p><p>Invisible, it had greatly reduced his 'coolness factor'.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>This one was similarly deeply concealed.</p><p></p><p>Though not defying the natural order, he was definitely not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood by, not daring to act recklessly.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong, on the other hand, was frozen in place like a statue, his expression and body completely rigid.</p><p></p><p>Only Lin Ling and Lüli, both bold, were silently watching the stone tablet fisherman.</p><p></p><p>The fisherman's first fishing process was exceptionally long.</p><p></p><p>He seemed deeply immersed in the act of fishing.</p><p></p><p>Even after half a day, he remained seated, unmoving. Li Fan began to suspect if he had failed already and was merely putting on a show.</p><p></p><p>However, with a brilliant golden light suddenly appearing in the mountain temple once again, Li Fan's doubt quickly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Observing the golden light ball in the hands of the stone tablet fisherman, Li Fan couldn't help but feel a bit uncertain about life.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong was equally shocked, unable to believe his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet fisherman stared at the light ball for a moment, "The 'Heavenly Emperor's Qi Scripture'?"</p><p></p><p>"Achieving the status of the Supreme Emperor in the world, gathering the vitality of all living things and the fortune of dynasties. Without cultivation, one can become as powerful as an Immortal Being..."</p><p></p><p>"Just thinking about fighting all the time is truly boring."</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet fisherman shrugged, "Here, take it."</p><p></p><p>With that, he casually threw the golden light ball towards Li Fan and the others.</p><p></p><p>Although Zhong Shentong also wanted to reach out and receive it, under Li Fan's subtly threatening gaze, he didn't dare to act presumptuously.</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving the golden light ball, Li Fan quickly examined it.</p><p></p><p>The contents inside matched exactly what the stone tablet fisherman had said.</p><p></p><p>It was a unique cultivation method passed down in a world devoid of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"It's quite ingenious."</p><p></p><p>"But ultimately not very useful."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan evaluated with a hint of regret, but still solemnly stored it in his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Watching the stone tablet fisherman, seeing him still engrossed in fishing, Li Fan couldn't help but speak, "Senior, this fishing pond only offers one chance per day."</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet fisherman yawned, "I know."</p><p></p><p>"But I'm just simply fishing."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet fisherman seemed to truly enjoy the process of fishing.</p><p></p><p>He didn't care whether he could catch the treasure light ball or not.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Zhong Shentong and Li Fan, he seemed like a genuine fisherman.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, I'll settle down here."</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to be nervous, just pretend I don't exist."</p><p></p><p>"I don't want anything caught, all is yours."</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet fisherman suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>Though Li Fan had anticipated it, how could he ignore such a powerful Immortal Being?</p><p></p><p>"Senior, do you perhaps want to find something useful from this fishing pond?" Li Fan asked bravely.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet fisherman seemed to have no ill intentions.</p><p></p><p>Cautiously, Li Fan inquired.</p><p></p><p>The fisherman's reply was straightforward, "Yes. In the Mysterious Yellow Realm, there's nothing that can remove the stone tablet on my back."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps something useful could be found in this fishing pond."</p><p></p><p>This answer caught Li Fan off guard, leaving him in silence.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Zhong Shentong and Lüli were full of curiosity, gazing at the ancient and simple stone tablet behind the fisherman.</p><p></p><p>"I'm too tired. Too painful."</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet fisherman sighed as he fished.</p><p></p><p>"The things happening in the Mysterious Yellow Realm every moment."</p><p></p><p>"Even if you don't want to know, they still come flooding into your mind uncontrollably."</p><p></p><p>"Do you think that's a good thing?"</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet fisherman shook his head repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"In the beginning, I even tried to blow up my own head."</p><p></p><p>"But the stone tablet never dies, so I don't die."</p>

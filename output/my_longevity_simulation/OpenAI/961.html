        <div class="content">
            <p>Outside the cave residence, Li Fan faintly felt the eerie atmosphere emanating from within.</p><p></p><p>There were also many whispers that seemed to be circling around his ears.</p><p></p><p>It was like the rumored lost souls.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan was very clear that there were no ghost cultivators in the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>After a cultivator fell, in the vast majority of cases, they would return directly to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Only in very few cases could some remnants of the soul be preserved.</p><p></p><p>It was already difficult to retain complete memories from their lifetime, let alone cultivate with a remnant soul.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the strange beings in the Yunsui Tiangong were exceptions.</p><p></p><p>They were beyond the usual scope of discussion.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted, and the whispers in his ears disappeared instantly.</p><p></p><p>He walked boldly into the Luo Shuzhen's cave residence, only to see human skeletons scattered all over the place, arranged in various poses, giving the impression that they were still alive.</p><p></p><p>A dwarf cultivator whose height only reached Li Fan's knees was solemnly conversing with one of the skulls, "Third brother, rest assured, I know you are not satisfied with the new wife I found for you."</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, I have already found someone else for you. Also, persuade fourth brother, it's already embarrassing not finding a partner in life, do you want to be forever lonely even after death?"</p><p></p><p>Chattering away, with a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>As if the skeleton in front of him was still alive.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan watched expressionlessly, cleared his throat, and awakened the absorbed dwarf cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Hey? Who are you?" The dwarf cultivator tilted his head, apparently trying hard to see Li Fan's face.</p><p></p><p>But by the time the dwarf cultivator tried to discern Li Fan's appearance, he had already changed his appearance and veiled himself.</p><p></p><p>The dwarf cultivator couldn't see clearly at all.</p><p></p><p>"You are the cultivator who can reconstruct the appearance of the deceased based on the skull?" Li Fan explained his purpose.</p><p></p><p>The dwarf cultivator then came to his senses and nodded repeatedly, "Yes, that's me."</p><p></p><p>He rubbed his hands, "I've been waiting for you for half a day. You said finishing the restoration task would reward at least ten thousand contribution points?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly, nodding, "Rest assured, you will not be shortchanged."</p><p></p><p>"But, are you really confident?" Li Fan lowered his head and scrutinized the other party, emphasizing his tone and asking again.</p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's gaze, the dwarf cultivator couldn't help but shiver involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>But soon he patted his chest loudly, guaranteeing, "I, Luo Shuzhen, have been dealing with the dead since I was a child. In my eyes, they are not just a bunch of skeletons! They are all living people! If I can't do it, perhaps no one else in this world can!"</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan say slowly, "Then let's begin."</p><p></p><p>He set up a formation around them, sealing off Luo Shuzhen's cave residence.</p><p></p><p>Then Li Fan projected the skull shape at the center of the Grand Museum.</p><p></p><p>Initially, Luo Shuzhen seemed distracted, still occasionally glancing at the skeletons placed in his cave residence.</p><p></p><p>However, as the skull gradually took shape, Luo Shuzhen's attention was completely drawn. The appearance of the skull left him completely dazed, drifting closer to the projection involuntarily, looking dazed.</p><p></p><p>"It's so perfect..."</p><p></p><p>"How can there be such a perfect skull structure in the world?" Luo Shuzhen muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect?" Li Fan furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>Thinking Li Fan was questioning, Luo Shuzhen immediately explained excitedly, "Isn't this perfection?"</p><p></p><p>"Look at this frontal bone, this occipital bone, and this sphenoid bone..."</p><p></p><p>"It's unparalleled. The proportions are just right."</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely... absolutely..."</p><p></p><p>After pausing for a while, Luo Shuzhen finally uttered eight words, "Perfect to the point of being flawless."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes slowly.</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan could prompt him, Luo Shuzhen eagerly began to reconstruct the appearance of the skull's previous life.</p><p></p><p>His method was also very peculiar, not through any secret technique.</p><p></p><p>But by nervously attempting to converse with the skull.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a projection, there was naturally no response from Luo Shuzhen.</p><p></p><p>But Luo Shuzhen seemed to have received a response, growing more and more excited.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was beginning to doubt, he saw Luo Shuzhen waving his right hand in the air, starting to depict the skull's appearance from its previous life.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan patiently waited.</p><p></p><p>When the final portrait appeared in front of Li Fan...</p><p></p><p>He struggled to control his facial expression, trying to conceal his astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the image in the air for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan asked in a low voice, "Are you... sure you're not mistaken?"</p><p></p><p>Even though he knew it was a redundant question, Li Fan still asked.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Luo Shuzhen was extremely excited, "Mistaken? You can question my..."</p><p></p><p>Before the other finished speaking, Li Fan took a deep breath, waved his sleeves, and suppressed Luo Shuzhen along with everything in his cave residence into the Wuxing Cave Dayan, erasing all traces of their presence.</p><p></p><p>"How could it be him?"</p><p></p><p>Standing in the air for a long time, Li Fan remained puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Unable to face this reality.</p><p></p><p>"The first cultivator infected by the Immortal Mortal Pestilence. The first cultivator infected by the Immortal Mortal Pestilence..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan contemplated for a long while, then soared towards the Yunzun Sea, his target being Yinshan, who was also conducting research on the Immortal Mortal Pestilence.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's sensing, Yinshan's research had not yet reached its final conclusion.</p><p></p><p>Yinshan seemed to have sensed something, becoming somewhat hesitant and indecisive.</p><p></p><p>The frequency of experiments had noticeably decreased.</p><p></p><p>Even...</p><p></p><p>He seemed reluctant to carry out the final verification.</p><p></p><p>With his speed at its peak, Li Fan soon arrived in front of Yinshan.</p><p></p><p>Yinshan was taken aback by Li Fan's sudden appearance.</p><p></p><p>As he was about to speak, Li Fan raised his hand to stop him.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Yin, regarding the first cultivator infected with the Immortal Mortal Pestilence..."</p><p></p><p>"I have made a startling discovery."</p><p></p><p>"This result is too unbelievable. It's incomprehensible. Perhaps you have a premonition as well?"</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Yinshan nodded with bitterness.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took a deep breath and said in a deep voice, "Well, then, please start the final verification."</p><p></p><p>"I also ask you to confirm it for me."</p><p></p><p>Standing still, after a long while, Yinshan sighed and led Li Fan to the laboratory.</p><p></p><p>Through the transparent outer wall, Li Fan could vaguely see the white rib Yinshan possessed displayed inside.</p><p></p><p>As the dense white pestilence continued to spew out, filling the entire area, Yinshan kept reciting incantations, his expression changing.</p><p></p><p>Under his control, the mist gradually thinned.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, it seemed as if something was flowing into the white rib.</p><p></p><p>Once the transparent area was completely emptied, Yinshan confirmed his speculations, his face pale as he fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"It's just as I suspected, just as I suspected."</p><p></p><p>He murmured softly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then slowly uttered his response.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 936</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Immersed in the aura left by the Transcendent Master of Transmitting Methods all day long, the bodies and souls of the thirty-three chosen immortals began to undergo gradual changes.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, the passage of time was unknown.</p><p></p><p>When they all finally escaped from the trap, their expressions, behaviors, and gazes became extremely similar.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, a sudden realization flashed in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>He finally remembered where the familiarity of the middle-aged cultivator came from.</p><p></p><p>The cold light in his eyes was almost identical to that of the First Emissary!</p><p></p><p>"Just like these chosen immortals, although they are not the same person. But for some reason, they have shared experiences. So they also started to become similar..."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder I could never find people with the same face."</p><p></p><p>"The First Emissary, and this middle-aged cultivator. They are subtly different from those black-clothed cultivators who seemed to have emerged from another era, and that [Wu] person. How many secrets does the Immortal Alliance hide?"</p><p></p><p>Countless thoughts flashed through Li Fan's mind in an instant, and then he continued to observe Wei Qi's upcoming experiences.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After the second lesson, it was the final training.</p><p></p><p>The thirty-three chosen immortals were led to different regions by different leaders. In a special space, they sensed the residual power hidden in the image of the Transcendent Master.</p><p></p><p>With the previous training, this goal became much easier, albeit relatively speaking.</p><p></p><p>In the sealed space, all they could do was this one thing.</p><p></p><p>There was even a certain guiding force in this space that made it impossible for them to think about anything else.</p><p></p><p>They could only focus day and night, hoping to achieve synchronization as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>It had to be said that at this point, there was almost no difference among these thirty-three chosen immortals.</p><p></p><p>Before and after were almost at the same time, with an overall error of not more than two days.</p><p></p><p>All thirty-three had completed the initial sensitization to the Transcendent Master's remnants.</p><p></p><p>Then, under a connecting beam of pure light, despite being in different locations within the Immortal Alliance, their consciousnesses were connected.</p><p></p><p>It was an extremely wonderful experience.</p><p></p><p>The thirty-three individuals were like a single entity, able to communicate in an instant without words.</p><p></p><p>A thought was worth a thousand words.</p><p></p><p>And the tacit understanding they had developed over a long period made their collective thoughts very single-minded, with almost no fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Li Fan's thoughts were interrupted once again.</p><p></p><p>"What's this, the pure light beam..."</p><p></p><p>"Why does it have a bit of Sister Zhao's [Unified Hearts] flavor?"</p><p></p><p>A puzzled look flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>As the Transcendent Master of Eternal Life that Li Fan understood best, he had personally experienced Sister Zhao's unique technique of [Unified Hearts] more than once.</p><p></p><p>After carefully examining the scene when the pure light beam appeared more than dozens of times, Li Fan finally caught some clues.</p><p></p><p>The thirty-three chosen immortals were perfectly unified in mind, and there was no room for any other presence.</p><p></p><p>"It's the use of pure law force, not another [Unified Hearts Transcendent Master]. Sister Zhao's power has been stolen?" Li Fan frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Does the Immortal Alliance have such ability?"</p><p></p><p>As expected, it unfolded as Li Fan had guessed.</p><p></p><p>As the thoughts of the thirty-three chosen immortals tended towards fusion, the pure light beam continued to disappear.</p><p></p><p>In the end, even without external objects.</p><p></p><p>These thirty-three individuals were able to communicate through their thoughts.</p><p></p><p>After thousands of attempts, they finally triggered the immense power left by the Transcendent Master of Transmitting Methods for the first time.</p><p></p><p>The impact brought about by the middle-aged cultivator's words, "A glance from the Transcendent Master could be equivalent to a strike at the Longevity Realm," was indeed too great.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, under the unanimous choice of the thirty-three chosen immortals, the first appearance of the Transcendent Master's Dharma Image was "Open Eyes and Flatten Nine Mountains."</p><p></p><p>After the first success, the Immortal Alliance finally allowed them some rest for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>However, this so-called rest was just some spare time for them.</p><p></p><p>They still stayed in that special space, not allowed to go out.</p><p></p><p>They became more and more proficient, and the power they could invoke from the Transcendent Master also grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>Until one day...</p><p></p><p>When the Dharma Image of the Transcendent Master grabbed the giant net woven by the Arrows of Heaven and threw it towards the territory of the Five Elders' Council, it finally prompted the intervention of the Longevity Transcendent of the Five Elders' Council.</p><p></p><p>According to the plan, the thirty-three chosen immortals directly detonated the Dharma Image, unleashing the instantaneous power to the maximum.</p><p></p><p>They did manage to obstruct the five Transcendent Masters, causing the giant net to fall.</p><p></p><p>Although a bit exhausted, they couldn't help but feel a sense of pride in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Even before reaching the Harmonized Dao Realm, they could confront the five strongest Transcendent Masters of the current Huang Realm head-on!</p><p></p><p>What a great honor!</p><p></p><p>However, they had no time to rejoice.</p><p></p><p>Another order was issued.</p><p></p><p>"Continue evolving the Dharma Image!"</p><p></p><p>The thirty-three individuals were shocked at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Even now, invoking the Transcendent Master's Dharma Image was not a simple matter for them.</p><p></p><p>It consumed their minds greatly and required a period of recovery afterward.</p><p></p><p>But the inexplicable voice seemed to have a kind of magic.</p><p></p><p>It made the thirty-three chosen immortals completely unable to resist.</p><p></p><p>They all subconsciously followed suit.</p><p></p><p>Thus, another Dharma Image emerged.</p><p></p><p>Before they could rest, the cold and unfeeling voice sounded once again.</p><p></p><p>"Continue!"</p><p></p><p>The thirty-three chosen immortals had already realized that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>If this continued, they were afraid they would all die from excessive consumption!</p><p></p><p>With each command issued repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Dharma Images of the five Transcendent Masters appeared in the world simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>As they had been drawn of a large amount of essence and spirit in a short time, these thirty-three chosen immortals had reached the end of their lives.</p><p></p><p>"Why?"</p><p></p><p>"Weren't we the hope for the revival of the Immortal Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>"Aren't we heroes?"</p><p></p><p>In the final moments of their lives, the minds of the thirty-three individuals were filled with incomprehension and resentment.</p><p></p><p>However, until their consciousness completely plunged into darkness.</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, not a single person came forward to explain to them.</p><p></p><p>Not even a word.</p><p></p><p>There was not even a hint of mockery.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"People always say that I, Li, am a great villain."</p><p></p><p>"I used to think so too."</p><p></p><p>"But today I realized..."</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the Immortal Alliance, there is still much for me to learn."</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan finished reading all of Wei Qi's experiences, he couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>Back in reality, due to the confrontation between the five Dharma Images and the five Transcendent Masters, the shaking of the Huang Realm continued to intensify.</p><p></p><p>And the battlefield seemed to have fallen into silence for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The five divine lights entwined with the Dharma Images of the Transcendent Masters.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Image summoned by the vitality essence of these thirty-three chosen immortals consumed their essence, far stronger than the previous ones.</p><p></p><p>Facing the five Transcendent Masters' siege, they only had their bodies shattered but not dispersed.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the giant net made of the Arrows of Heaven fell onto the territory of the Five Elders' Council.</p>

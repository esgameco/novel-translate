        <h1>Chapter 873</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan was shocked by what Tianyang said. The ability Tianyang mentioned naturally stemmed from the spatial power of the "Ink Stone," which originated from the laws of Xuanhuang and was absorbed by cultivators through new methods. Even in the current Xuanhuang realm, there was no way to separate it. Yet in this eerie remote small world, it was being gnawed on?</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Senior Brother. Those unknown beings are like ants crawling on me. They might sting or itch, but they can't threaten my life," Tianyang conveyed briefly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, however, did not take it lightly.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the situation in the Soul Yin World was different from what the 115th Immortal Alliance exploration team had detected upon arrival. Cautiously, Li Fan and Tianyang began to explore the Soul Yin World.</p><p></p><p>This small world was not vast, even smaller than the Lingmu realm in terms of area. Strangely, Li Fan couldn't find the spiritual beings described by the Immortal Alliance exploration team. The vast land was gloomy, with no signs of vegetation or animals, not even a complete stone.</p><p></p><p>After scanning with his spiritual sense in the Soul Yin World, except for Li Fan and Tianyang, there were no other beings present.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression became serious as he picked up some gray soil from the ground, examining it carefully. It seemed like ordinary soil, but with just a brief contact, there were burnt traces on his hand, indicating it was not something ordinary.</p><p></p><p>"No pain, silently corroding," Li Fan's eyes flashed. A surge of vitality emerged from within him, trying to heal his hand's injury. Surprisingly, the injected vitality seemed to become a nutrient for the burnt area, rapidly spreading on his palm. Li Fan acted swiftly, cutting off his hand, but what followed shocked him.</p><p></p><p>The severed hand, upon falling on the gray soil, as if consumed by flames, faded into gray, blending with the soil.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Li Fan stared at the gray soil spread all around, feeling eerie and astonished by the level of strangeness in this place exceeding his imagination.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was contemplating leaving, Tianyang suddenly transmitted a message, "Senior Brother, the strength of the consumption around here seems to vary in different locations. Perhaps we can identify the anomaly based on the intensity."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan hesitated for a moment but nodded in agreement. With Li Fan's approval, Tianyang sensed and swiftly flew over the Soul Yin World's airspace. Soon, he pinpointed a location where the consumption force seemed particularly strong.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could faintly sense inexplicable fluctuations emanating from Tianyang, as if he were engaged in a fierce battle with a formidable opponent. After a brief moment, Tianyang had to retreat.</p><p></p><p>"It's like being devoured by ants. Don't you feel it, Senior Brother?" Tianyang asked through transmission.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head, directing his Rainbow Divine Light towards the location.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, he felt nothing unusual. But Li Fan had a vague premonition that if he were to use his fire attribute spiritual power as before, the consequences would be far from simple.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Li Fan suppressed all his spiritual energy within himself, relying solely on his physical body and Rainbow Divine Light for action, which led him to notice a discrepancy. While he had previously surveyed the entire Soul Yin World, it was absolutely level except for one location seeming slightly raised, as if something were buried beneath the gray soil.</p><p></p><p>Drawing from his experience, Li Fan used Rainbow Divine Light to shield his right hand and dug into the soil. Upon digging deeper, Li Fan's hand touched a hard object. With a serious expression, he picked it up from the depths of the gray soil.</p><p></p><p>As he pulled it out, the accumulated gray dirt on the surface vanished. The object revealed itself to be a human skull, distinct from an ordinary one, with what seemed like a third eye at the brow. Moreover, there were natural golden-black patterns on the skull.</p><p></p><p>Turning it over, Li Fan was startled to find the inside of the skull appeared moldy, with gray patches that seemed conscious in a way, crawling around upon sensing the presence of a living being after years of silence.</p><p></p><p>A sense of inexplicable crisis suddenly emerged in Li Fan's heart. He cast Rainbow Divine Light, forming a perfect seal, isolating his aura, calming the gray patches once again.</p><p></p><p>"The three-eyed figure is not from the Xuanhuang world. It seems the catastrophic event in the Soul Yin World was caused by these gray mold spots," Li Fan speculated.</p>

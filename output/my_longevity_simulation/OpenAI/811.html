        <h1>Chapter 811</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The puppet of Tianyang was surrounded by flames, suddenly descending from the sky and plunging into the ground.</p><p></p><p>With a deafening sound, a deep passage was excavated in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Countless tree men flew in and accepted Li Fan's command to dig out the underground resources buried here.</p><p></p><p>If one were to look around from the top of the spirit tree, they would see scenes like this everywhere in the Spirit Wood World.</p><p></p><p>"Master, it took the spirit tree more than four thousand years to slightly restore vitality here. The world's ecology is still very fragile. If we continue to excavate like this..." The tree man chief advised with concern.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly, "Your perspective is too narrow. Resources left unused and buried underground are no different from ordinary stones. Only by making full use of resources and developing quickly can we progress on the right path."</p><p></p><p>"We just need to grow powerful enough to plunder and nourish ourselves from other worlds before the resources deplete and the world declines."</p><p></p><p>"Staying confined to one world means stagnation. Even if we can survive for a while, we will eventually be engulfed by other worlds."</p><p></p><p>The tree man chief seemed to be hearing this theory for the first time and was stunned, "Is that so?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't answer, just revealing a mysterious expression.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the numerous hardworking tree men in this realm and suddenly had a thought, "If we help these tree men and collectively enhance their strength, I wonder if there will be a feedback in cultivation similar to the Sit Immortal Technique."</p><p></p><p>Tree men cannot cultivate; their strength is fixed from birth.</p><p></p><p>And the strength of tree men depends on the strength of the spirit tree itself. The stronger the spirit tree, the stronger the tree men it gives birth to.</p><p></p><p>With such spiritual beings, with the right methods, they can grow much faster than cultivators.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, Li Fan knew of at least ten kinds of rare treasures that could nourish the spirit tree.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Having a shared view of the spirit tree's overall vision, Li Fan knew exactly where valuable resources were hidden in this realm.</p><p></p><p>With Tianyang under Li Fan's instructions, like a loach drilling holes, it took a few days to open up the passage first.</p><p></p><p>After supervising the tree men in their mining work, Li Fan took Tianyang and temporarily returned to the Xuanghuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, he made sure to visit the ruins of the Heavenly Mechanism Sect and thoroughly plundered all the treasures, including the Heavenly Universe Dice.</p><p></p><p>"Now, there is no Unified Association of Ten Thousand Realms yet. If we suddenly approach them and try to gain the trust of the Five Elders Council, it might take considerable effort, similar to previous attempts."</p><p></p><p>"Instead, let's think of a way to make the Unified Association of Ten Thousand Realms prominent..."</p><p></p><p>"Anchor for 6 years."</p><p></p><p>In his memory, various events that happened that year flashed through Li Fan's mind, and he quickly found a suitable target.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, the Five Elders Council launched a surprise attack on the Jiushan Prefecture, attempting to seize the territory.</p><p></p><p>However, for some reason, the news leaked, and instead of succeeding in a surprise attack, they fell into an ambush laid by the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, resulting in a disastrous defeat.</p><p></p><p>This incident became a classic example for the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance to mention repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Fan was well aware of the details and the whole story of the events.</p><p></p><p>Jiushan Prefecture, bordering the Five Elders Council and the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, was a region formed after the death of a strange beast, which made the space extremely unstable, rendering teleportation arrays unusable within the territory.</p><p></p><p>The management costs were too high, and the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance only built fortresses and towns at critical locations on the Jiushan Pass.</p><p></p><p>Most other places were not taken care of.</p><p></p><p>As a result, it fostered unique scenes not often seen in other prefectures: a mix of different factions.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, there were many local forces led by the Lingyuan Sect, as well as numerous spies trained by the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>Jiushan Prefecture was easy to defend but difficult to attack. No matter who controlled it, they would have a strategic advantage.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders Council had always wanted to incorporate it into their territory but failed to do so.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, they launched another attack, believing they had successfully flipped the Lingyuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Lingyuan Sect, the largest local force in Jiushan Prefecture, though under the rule of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, operated relatively independently, with many Nascent Soul and Core Formation cultivators and a highly united following.</p><p></p><p>Once they turned against them, combined with external support, they could indeed take Jiushan Prefecture in a single stroke.</p><p></p><p>This battle drove the Five Elders Council to completely drop the idea of attacking from Jiushan Prefecture's direction and shift their strategic focus to the Tianling Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"The Lingyuan Sect..." Li Fan quickly pondered the cause and effects of the matter.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but frown upon this rather peculiar organization.</p><p></p><p>Although in the overall context of the Xuanghuang Realm, the Lingyuan Sect was just an insignificant existence, in Jiushan Prefecture, it was not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Given the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance's approach, allowing such an independent organization to exist within their jurisdiction seemed unusual.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the unique terrain of Jiushan Prefecture, this also had to do with the Lingyuan Sect's "inextinguishable wildfire."</p><p></p><p>"The Cangsheng Lingyuan Technique. The more people practicing this technique simultaneously, the faster their cultivation speed."</p><p></p><p>"This is enough to offset the negative effects that using the same technique usually brings."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a rough understanding of this technique from before but had no interest in practicing such obviously suspicious cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>"The Lingyuan Sect Leader has never appeared in any public setting. Their identity is extremely mysterious."</p><p></p><p>"Even if the Lingyuan Sect was wiped out in the past, it would resurface quickly due to the peculiarity of their technique."</p><p></p><p>"Besides the Cangsheng Lingyuan Technique, it seems there are other secret techniques within the sect that not only resolve the mutual hostility among practitioners but also can repeatedly and cyclically utilize blessed lands."</p><p></p><p>"For example, I have seen Chen Yuru before. His Peach Blossom Blessed Land has appeared on previous cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"There must be some unique restrictions. Otherwise, even if he can hide well, he will eventually be found out."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slowly contemplated everything about the Lingyuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>"However, I don't need to conflict with them this time."</p><p></p><p>"I just need to help the Five Elders Council to take Jiushan Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Li Fan stood on the Tianyang puppet and swiftly rode towards Jiushan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the Jiushan territory, he deployed formations around himself to conceal his presence.</p><p></p><p>He lurked near the Tianlao Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elders Council probably wouldn't think that their defeat wasn't due to a traitor leaking information but merely a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Li Fan soon saw a young man in white clothes slowly emerging from the horizon.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 955</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Is it only when appearing in the Xuanhuang realm that a collective riot will break out?"</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan contemplated, he crossed the statue of Qin Tang and hurried towards the interior of Cloud and Water Celestial Palace.</p><p></p><p>The area he was heading to was one that Li Fan had never set foot in before - the residence of the head of Cloud and Water Celestial Palace.</p><p></p><p>It was also the location of “Hanhai”.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's current perspective, recalling the struggles he had seen in the Cloud and Water Celestial Palace years ago, even Hanhai was at the peak of the Integration Realm, not yet reaching immortality.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention he had already fallen long ago and could only exist with a bizarre body.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Fan was not worried about any dangers on this trip.</p><p></p><p>What Li Fan was more concerned about was whether the Celestial Physician was currently lurking in a corner, spying on his every move.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he arrived at the rear of the Cloud and Water Celestial Palace, where a blue protective light sphere completely enveloped the area.</p><p></p><p>The prohibition seal that sealed the Cloud and Water Celestial Palace took effect from here and spread throughout the entire area.</p><p></p><p>After observing for a moment, Li Fan noticed that from the blue light sphere, invisible shockwaves were emitted from time to time.</p><p></p><p>It was due to the shockwaves that the prohibition gradually weakened.</p><p></p><p>"What is this..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Familiar with “The Guide to the Universe,” Li Fan quickly realized that even in slumber, Hanhai had been greatly affected emotionally, unable to control the overflowing energy and releasing shockwaves.</p><p></p><p>Just like a mortal's sleepwalking, strictly speaking, it was also a kind of ailment for cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Celestial Physician guided me here just to alleviate Hanhai's pain?"</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be. It's just a simple errand, strengthening the prohibition seal..."</p><p></p><p>"There must be a deeper meaning behind this."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>He released a strand of extremely subtle and almost completely blank divine consciousness, passed through the blue protective light membrane, and entered the interior of the sphere.</p><p></p><p>A blue and white interspersed bead floated in midair.</p><p></p><p>Similar to the Qinghai Bead, but with obvious differences.</p><p></p><p>The spherical bead rotated rapidly, with a hint of black that was glaring on the blue and white surface.</p><p></p><p>As if in a nightmare, the black color was always entwined with the blue and white bead, unable to dispel.</p><p></p><p>“Has Hanhai's essence disappeared, leaving only this bead?”</p><p></p><p>After searching and finding that there was nothing else inside, Li Fan sighed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the black color is the source of torment for Hanhai..."</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Li Fan ultimately infused a strand of divine consciousness into it.</p><p></p><p>A dizzying sensation.</p><p></p><p>As if entering the realm of a fallen immortal, attached to a completely new body.</p><p></p><p>However, he could not control it and could only passively observe and experience what happened with this body.</p><p></p><p>"The Venerable Celestial Physician has been gone for a long time, and I don't know if things will work out."</p><p></p><p>Hanhai sat on the main hall of the sect, with a dragon turtle the size of an ordinary tortoise under his feet, muttering discontentedly.</p><p></p><p>"The Venerable Celestial Physician said before leaving that there was at least a ninety percent chance of success in this matter. We should have some confidence in her."</p><p></p><p>Unlike the worried expression of the dragon turtle, Hanhai seemed very relaxed, soothingly smiling.</p><p></p><p>The turtle shook its head slightly, curling the dragon snake into its own shell.</p><p></p><p>"I can still live for a hundred thousand years, what is there to fear? If it's really unbearable, I'll just find a pond to sleep in. After all the tribulations are over, what can they do to me?"</p><p></p><p>"Just hearing what Qin Tang's kid said, some of the other sects are already getting restless."</p><p></p><p>"They have begun to secretly spread rumors of surrender..."</p><p></p><p>Hanhai snorted, "Speaking of defeat before the battle, these losers will be taken care of by the Venerable Celestial Physician!"</p><p></p><p>The turtle smiled bitterly, "This is not a situation of speaking defeat before the battle. It's been a long struggle, and everyone is almost depleted. We have no choice but to do this..."</p><p></p><p>"If you ask me, you can't blame them entirely either. If this war continues to drag on, we won't see any hope..."</p><p></p><p>Hanhai roared angrily, cutting off the turtle, "Enough!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you think the same way?"</p><p></p><p>"Being in this situation, do you think the other side is having a good time?"</p><p></p><p>"At this point, it's about who can hold on till the end. If they surrender now, then what's the point of all the sacrifices made by our fellow brethren earlier?"</p><p></p><p>The turtle sighed slightly, remaining silent.</p><p></p><p>The great hall fell into a deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>The turtle spoke again, "Speaking of the Venerable Celestial Physician, I seem to have not seen her for a long time..."</p><p></p><p>At that moment, there was a disciple's screams from outside.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable..."</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"Run away, the Venerable has gone mad!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The screams were so sudden that Hanhai and the turtle's faces changed instantly.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, they transformed into blue and black lights, heading straight to the source of the screams.</p><p></p><p>In the air, they witnessed an unforgettable scene.</p><p></p><p>Their admired Venerable Celestial Physician, eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>Wielding the Heavenly Slayer Sword, ruthlessly slaughtering the disciples of the Cloud and Water Celestial Palace.</p><p></p><p>With the Venerable Celestial Physician's cultivation, under her attacks, the disciples had no room for resistance.</p><p></p><p>Black sword lights passed through, mercilessly reaping the lives of the disciples.</p><p></p><p>Hanhai was furious, roaring, "Stop!"</p><p></p><p>A blue giant palm descended from the sky, striking towards the Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable, without even looking at Hanhai, merely released a sword light from the Heavenly Slayer Sword, tearing apart the blue giant palm.</p><p></p><p>The sword light, unabated in its power, then attacked Hanhai.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p></p><p>The turtle transformed into its full body, using its extremely hard shell to block the black sword light.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In a massive vibration, the turtle suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Hanhai also regained some sanity.</p><p></p><p>"You hold off the Venerable, I'll protect the disciples and help them retreat!"</p><p></p><p>He then sent out strands of blue threads, flying towards various parts of the Cloud and Water Celestial Palace.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the Heavenly Slayer Sword suddenly erupted with countless black lights.</p><p></p><p>In an ambush, Hanhai's rescue was all intercepted!</p><p></p><p>The black lights passed through every blue thread, pulling them back to Hanhai in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Before Hanhai could react, like black needles, they pinned him in mid-air!</p><p></p><p>"You're not the Venerable Celestial Physician?!"</p><p></p><p>Although Hanhai couldn't move his limbs, he could still speak.</p><p></p><p>His face betrayed a horrified expression.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" Hanhai yelled angrily and despairingly.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Celestial Physician completely ignored Hanhai.</p><p></p><p>With her eyes closed, she directed the Heavenly Slayer Sword to mercilessly harvest the lives of the remaining disciples of the Cloud and Water Celestial Palace.</p><p></p><p>As the Sect Master, Hanhai could only helplessly watch as his disciples died tragically before him.</p><p></p><p>"No... no..."</p><p></p><p>When there was no more sign of life left in the Cloud and Water Celestial Palace besides them, Hanhai couldn't even muster curses anymore.</p><p></p><p>Trembling slightly all over, tears of blood in his eyes.</p>

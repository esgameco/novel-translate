            <p>At the next moment, the scenery changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>The connection with the original body was severed.</p><p></p><p>The strand of consciousness separated was then injected into a body.</p><p></p><p>Simultaneously, a myriad of information flooded in like a tide.</p><p></p><p>The possessed body belonged to an ordinary mortal.</p><p></p><p>It took several days for all the information to be absorbed amidst the throbbing pain in the mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face showed a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>Within this radiant sphere was a fictional time and space.</p><p></p><p>It was the end of a dynasty, with corrupt officials and people living in misery.</p><p></p><p>Disasters were rampant, and starvation was widespread.</p><p></p><p>The common people only sought food and fullness, but it was merely a luxury.</p><p></p><p>Thus, in despair, they rose up to fight back.</p><p></p><p>Now, smoke signals were rising everywhere, and Li Fan was part of one of the rebel forces, an inconspicuous figure among them.</p><p></p><p>Due to digesting the knowledge, he looked dazed and was considered to have contracted a strange illness.</p><p></p><p>He was sent to the military doctor for treatment.</p><p></p><p>This military doctor was quite knowledgeable and upon mere observation, prescribed a sedative.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan regained his senses and was about to leave, a prompt suddenly appeared before him: "Identified Wang Zuo's talent, White Mo Rest."</p><p></p><p>"Current Favorability: 1."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression couldn't help but be strange.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of ghost is the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance playing?"</p><p></p><p>Instead of having too much contact with the military doctor White Mo Rest, Li Fan took a stroll in the rebel camp.</p><p></p><p>In just three or four days, he discovered a "Peerless General," and two "Ancient Divine Weapons."</p><p></p><p>There were also numerous other materials, too many to count.</p><p></p><p>Some only had rough favorability prompts, but some even had strategy reminders.</p><p></p><p>Their preferences, personality, weaknesses - everything was known clearly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan became interested.</p><p></p><p>Following the prompts, he approached and catered to their interests one by one.</p><p></p><p>In no time, from being an unknown in the rebel forces, he started gaining some fame.</p><p></p><p>More than ten days later, he even received a reminder of the imminent night attack by the official troops.</p><p></p><p>However, instead of warning anyone, he only gathered a group of trusted followers and made preparations in secret.</p><p></p><p>The rebel forces were instantly defeated in the night attack.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, along with his group, managed to escape by a stroke of luck.</p><p></p><p>As the leader who led everyone to survive, Li Fan gradually established his prestige.</p><p></p><p>Later, following another prompt that appeared before him, solely with a hundred or so people, after a long-distance raid, they occupied a small city left vacant by the army that went out to suppress bandits.</p><p></p><p>He found his place.</p><p></p><p>From there, he gradually absorbed surrounding powers.</p><p></p><p>In just five years, he cleared the realm and overthrew the decadent rule of the dynasty, becoming a founding king of a new era.</p><p></p><p>The view shattered layer by layer.</p><p></p><p>Everything returned to nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan pondered the purpose of this illusionary scene, the scenery changed once again.</p><p></p><p>It was another illusory time and space, this time set in a fictional cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>He possessed the body of a young mortal man who was rejected by the Tai Chu Sect because he had no spiritual roots.</p><p></p><p>The young man begged bitterly and only then obtained the identity of a miscellaneous disciple.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he thought he could only barely get through life.</p><p></p><p>But he never expected that, by chance, he found a stone bead in the mountains behind.</p><p></p><p>This stone bead had the incredible effect of devouring surrounding objects, nourishing with spiritual fluid, and improving aptitude.</p><p></p><p>He gradually became a Foundation Establishment cultivator, Nascent Soul cultivator, and Yuanying cultivator, step by step.</p><p></p><p>During this journey, he not only gained three beautiful Dao companions and an ancient divine beast as a mount but also encountered one stroke of luck after another, discovered immortal tombs, and obtained unprecedented immortal tools in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>After wandering the cultivation world for a century, he eventually became the strongest of his time.</p><p></p><p>He left in all his beauty.</p><p></p><p>The picture shattered once again.</p><p></p><p>When he returned from this illusion, Li Fan faintly felt that his mindset had undergone some changes.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, before he could analyze it, he fell into the cycle of illusion once more.</p><p></p><p>Next, Li Fan went through another ninety-seven cycles of reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>The encounters were mostly similar.</p><p></p><p>Generally, they began with a humble background, followed by accidental opportunities. Subsequently, they would rise through adversity and achieve the typical story of becoming the world's strongest.</p><p></p><p>After all the cycles of reincarnation ended, the radiant sphere in Li Fan's hands faded completely and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Although the experiences of the ninety-nine cycles of reincarnation were illusory, they felt too real.</p><p></p><p>They were eerily similar to what he had experienced with Zhao Shijie, extremely vivid.</p><p></p><p>Having gone through so many cycles of reincarnation, even with Li Fan's current mindset, he couldn't help but be influenced to some extent.</p><p></p><p>Slowly activating the Mysterious Yellow Immortal Heart Mantra, he gradually diluted these experiences.</p><p></p><p>"The Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance's move is quite interesting," Li Fan said mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>The radiant sphere that had descended earlier like a torrential rain had coincidentally fallen into some territories belonging to the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators and mortals were attracted to the sphere out of curiosity and fell into the cycle of ninety-nine reincarnations.</p><p></p><p>Upon waking up, although their bodies were not affected in any way, something had changedâ€¦</p><p></p><p>It was the impact of the illusion. Originally ordinary individuals, after waking up, inexplicably saw themselves as the "Chosen One."</p><p></p><p>If it had just been a one-sided belief, it wouldn't have been a big deal.</p><p></p><p>But they all realized that they lived in a world forcibly reconstructed by the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>Thus, they all made grand vows to overthrow the Five Elders Council's rule and rescue the cultivators from their miserable lives.</p><p></p><p>After going through the ninety-nine cycles of reincarnation, these people had indeed become somewhat different.</p><p></p><p>Instead of confronting head-on, they would lurk, cultivate first, and then cause destruction.</p><p></p><p>Although not specifically expressed, judging from the tone of the Five Elders Council, the influence of the radiant white sphere had caused quite a headache.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered, "Apart from awakening the cultivators, there seems to be some kind of spiritual imprint-like existence."</p><p></p><p>"How can the sons of heaven bow beneath others?"</p><p></p><p>"To be able to instill the idea of overturning the rule of the Five Elders Council under the influence of the Five Venerable Beings."</p><p></p><p>"Good stuff!"</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Li Fan was not affected by the radiant sphere.</p><p></p><p>Even if he had been affected...</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't have been a problem.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was different from the others.</p><p></p><p>With "The Real Deal" in his hands, he could be considered a true Chosen One!</p><p></p><p>Looking at the storage ring sent by the Five Elders Council, filled densely with at least a thousand radiant spheres...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan rubbed his chin.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the cost of this item isn't high. Otherwise, it wouldn't have been scattered on such a large scale."</p><p></p><p>He took out another sphere and started studying it.</p><p></p><p>A faint light radiated from the sphere, and he was decrypting it in his Knowledge Sea.</p><p></p><p>"There are traces of an illusion formation."</p><p></p><p>"But more importantly..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan furrowed his brows slightly, sensing a familiar odor.</p><p></p><p>"The Monkey Mind Trap?"</p>

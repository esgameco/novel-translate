        <h1>Chapter 897</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Countless cultivators inquired about it, but he ignored them all.</p><p></p><p>After all, this matter was too shocking. If it were to spread, the cultivation world on the brink of despair would seem like the end times in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Alone, he hid away, pondering over the gains and contemplating the meaning of the words from the faceless true immortal.</p><p></p><p>After a flurry of commotion, the Xuánhuáng Realm gradually returned to its calm state.</p><p></p><p>With the collapse and disappearance of the ascension passages, the impact of the catastrophe on the mortal realm seemed to gradually dissipate.</p><p></p><p>After about a year passed, the king of the realm suddenly realized that there was a slight deviation in the token position of the Xuánhuáng Realm.</p><p></p><p>The change was minimal.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't been paying close attention and experiencing a sudden surge in strength due to the baptism of celestial energy, he might have overlooked it.</p><p></p><p>But how could the prepared king ignore this detail?</p><p></p><p>Three more years passed.</p><p></p><p>By monitoring the changes in the token values, the king of the realm finally confirmed that the entire Xuánhuáng Realm was deviating towards a direction in the boundless void.</p><p></p><p>What shocked the king even more was that it wasn't just the Xuánhuáng Realm.</p><p></p><p>All the other cultivation worlds he could observe and connect to were the same!</p><p></p><p>The conclusion was obvious.</p><p></p><p>Something existed in the boundless void, drawing all the cultivation worlds towards it!</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to the words of the faceless true immortal.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly escape, if you delay, it will be too late."</p><p></p><p>The king of the realm instantly felt a chill down his spine.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the king might have had the immediate thought of escaping alone.</p><p></p><p>As the cultivator with the highest talent in the Xuánhuáng Realm at the time, the king of the realm could not bear to watch his homeland slowly march towards destruction.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the king ultimately made a noble decision.</p><p></p><p>That was to escape with the Xuánhuáng Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even though the king of the realm already had the body of a demigod at that time, pushing the entire world was just wishful thinking.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention overcoming that terrifying suction force…</p><p></p><p>But the king of the realm did not give up.</p><p></p><p>After studying the scriptures scraped from the immortals and integrating his own knowledge, the scholar king deduced a grand and extraordinary formation.</p><p></p><p>He named it the "Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation."</p><p></p><p>According to the king's calculations, relying solely on the resources of the Xuánhuáng Realm was simply not enough to resist the unknown suction force in the boundless void.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Xuánhuáng Realm were emptied, it would not be able to escape that terrifying and unimaginable force.</p><p></p><p>So, one of the functions of the Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation was to lock onto the caves and small worlds in the surrounding void, capture them, and initiate interrealm warfare.</p><p></p><p>While plundering resources and replenishing one's own strength, it also formed a chain-like effect, reducing the speed at which the Xuánhuáng Realm was being attracted.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed killing two birds with one stone.</p><p></p><p>However, building such a grand formation with his own strength alone was beyond his capabilities.</p><p></p><p>It was necessary to gather and coordinate the vast majority of the Xuánhuáng Realm's forces to complete the construction of the Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation.</p><p></p><p>As for revealing the true situation and rallying everyone together…</p><p></p><p>The king of the realm had also considered this.</p><p></p><p>After inspecting the actual conduct of the Xuánhuáng Realm cultivators, he decisively gave up.</p><p></p><p>If at that time, those cultivators knew about the crisis facing the Xuánhuáng Realm, the vast majority of them would choose to escape immediately.</p><p></p><p>Choosing to stay and rescue the Xuánhuáng Realm with the king of the realm would be an extremely rare occurrence.</p><p></p><p>Building the Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation required the strength of these cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the king of the realm decided to first unify the Xuánhuáng Realm and better coordinate the forces.</p><p></p><p>He was a once-in-a-thousand-year genius, and now the only body of a demigod in the Xuánhuáng Realm.</p><p></p><p>With the many immortal techniques inherited from the ascension passages, achieving this was not very difficult.</p><p></p><p>And everything went as he anticipated.</p><p></p><p>After persuading the twelve top cultivators with astonishing talents to assist him, the king of the realm eradicated all resistance within a few years.</p><p></p><p>Led by him, the twelve Immortal Kings, they established the overpowering Xuántiān Sect in the Xuánhuáng Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation was constructed with unprecedented efficiency.</p><p></p><p>And it successfully captured and conquered other worlds.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the token deviation gradually slowed down.</p><p></p><p>Everything seemed to be developing in a favorable direction.</p><p></p><p>The king of the realm seemed to have seen the bright future of the Xuánhuáng Realm escaping calamity.</p><p></p><p>However, the arrival of an unexpected guest completely disrupted his plans.</p><p></p><p>The moment the purple aura appeared in the Xuánhuáng Realm, the king of the realm already faintly sensed the opponent's background.</p><p></p><p>An incomplete demigod body that had not been completely cleansed, a fragmented and incomplete aura of immortality.</p><p></p><p>It should be like him, a cultivator who had escaped with his life from the collapse of the ascension passages.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the king of the realm was vigilant towards this equally formidable opponent.</p><p></p><p>However, the opponent claimed to be just passing through. They would stay for a short while and leave soon.</p><p></p><p>If two demigods were to fight, it would undoubtedly cause irreparable trauma to the Xuánhuáng Realm.</p><p></p><p>After much consideration, the king of the realm chose not to act.</p><p></p><p>He had never expected that this decision would sow the seeds of future disaster.</p><p></p><p>When the Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation captured another new world and the king of the realm personally went out to battle during the gap.</p><p></p><p>The existence calling himself the Grand Mage of Heaven seduced many local cultivators from the Xuánhuáng Realm into his sect.</p><p></p><p>And passed on numerous techniques, secrets, and mystical powers.</p><p></p><p>Upon returning victorious, the king of the realm immediately understood the opponent's intentions.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to shake the rule of the Xuántiān Sect by using those cultivators.</p><p></p><p>To incite a rebellion, then reap the benefits when both sides were weakened.</p><p></p><p>And the ultimate goal was the aura of immortality on the king of the realm.</p><p></p><p>How could the king of the realm comply with the opponent's wishes?</p><p></p><p>So, he rushed into the Heavenly City and directly engaged in a battle with the Grand Mage of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Although he suffered minor injuries, the opponent's injuries were far more severe than his. From then on, the opponent behaved.</p><p></p><p>However, the opponent refused to leave, and the king of the realm had no good solution.</p><p></p><p>Fearing the opponent would act out of desperation, the king of the realm simply ignored him.</p><p></p><p>In this battle, he felt he had gained something.</p><p></p><p>By extracting some of the aura of immortality from the opponent, he might be able to directly reshape his demigod body in the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>At that time, infusing the power of immortality, he could significantly reduce the resources needed to activate the Floating Crossing Starry Sky Formation.</p><p></p><p>The Xuánhuáng Realm could then quickly escape the crisis.</p><p></p><p>But the king of the realm underestimated the despicableness of some cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Or underestimated the Grand Mage of Heaven's ability to deceive.</p><p></p><p>When those cultivators who had entered the Heavenly City united at a crucial moment when everything seemed to be heading in the best direction.</p><p></p><p>They launched a surprise attack on the Xuántiān Sect.</p><p></p><p>From then on, the history of the Xuánhuáng Realm took a completely different path.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to the past, the young man's expression was absent-minded.</p><p></p><p>He looked up, as if he could see the terrifying presence that attracted and devoured everything.</p>

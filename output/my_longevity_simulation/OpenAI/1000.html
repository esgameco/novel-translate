        <h1>Chapter 1000</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Xuan Sushe took a deep breath, looked directly at Li Fan, and spoke slowly, "I am willing to help resolve the crisis for the senior, but..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan waved his hand, interrupting the other party, "No problem, just tell me the information about the second clone, I will handle it myself."</p><p></p><p>"Our struggle between us, you human juniors are not qualified to intervene."</p><p></p><p>Although she was a dignified and venerable celestial venerable, being called a junior one by Li Fan did not make Xuan Sushe angry. After all, compared to the ancient Tianxuan Mirror, they were indeed several generations lower. Such a way of addressing was completely accurate.</p><p></p><p>Instead, Xuan Sushe was relieved that Li Fan only needed to provide information and did not require her to act.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, she transmitted the relevant information to Li Fan using her divine sense.</p><p></p><p>A moment later...</p><p></p><p>"Father, please forgive me," self-exclaimed Xuan Sushe after doing all this.</p><p></p><p>Finding out the whereabouts of the human clone of the Tianxuan Mirror, Li Fan did not act immediately.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he turned his gaze towards Lu Xichan, who had been silent with her head lowered, with a dark expression.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan sensed Li Fan's gaze and grew more uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"Master..." seeing Li Fan silent for a long time, she finally gathered up the courage to ask tentatively.</p><p></p><p>"Xichan, you really disappoint me," Li Fan's voice entered her ears, and Lu Xichan's body trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I officially pass on the position of Chief of the Strategy Hall to you. It has been two hundred and eighty-six years already. So many years have passed, but your skills in strategic formations remain the same..."</p><p></p><p>"Master, I..." Lu Xichan felt a bit wronged upon hearing this, her heart suddenly saddened.</p><p></p><p>When she took over as the Chief of the Strategy Hall, she only received support from a few elders. The vast majority chose to wait and see, and there were even many who wanted to take her place. It was a precarious situation, creating a tense atmosphere. Fortunately, after several years of mediation and balance, she finally managed to stabilize her position.</p><p></p><p>As the Chief of the Strategy Hall in the Immortal Alliance, her responsibilities were quite heavy. She not only had to handle various affairs reported by the Strategy Halls of various states but also participate in monthly meetings to discuss the operation of the Immortal Alliance with other departments.</p><p></p><p>For over two hundred years, except for the previous leakage of the defense formation, there were almost no flaws in the Strategy Hall. She had also made many merits.</p><p></p><p>She had dedicated herself to this cause, and it was indisputably related.</p><p></p><p>She had done her best to reach where she was today. How could she make further progress in the ways of formations?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, her level in strategy formations had also made some progress, albeit not any major breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan was conflicted in her heart and was about to speak up to explain herself.</p><p></p><p>But she was abruptly cut off by Li Fan, "I know what you are thinking. Only the weak make excuses for themselves."</p><p></p><p>"A true strong does not abandon the pursuit of the Tao even when on the brink of life and death!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's voice was heavy, "Ask yourself, have you really given your all?!"</p><p></p><p>"I..." Lu Xichan was momentarily speechless.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's tone became harsher, "Not striving for progress, but indulging in female company..."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Li Fan glanced at Xuan Sushe next to him.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Sushe's cheeks flushed, and she buried her head even lower.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked back at Lu Xichan, "You deserve punishment!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a whip made of the power of the soul emerged in his hand, and Li Fan shouted angrily, "Kneel!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan was, after all, a cultivator of the Way of Harmony, and as the Chief of the Strategy Hall of the Immortal Alliance, she held a high and esteemed position.</p><p></p><p>She also had her pride, but facing Li Fan's cold and merciless eyes, she felt her legs give way, and she actually obeyed her instincts and bent her knees to kneel!</p><p></p><p>Kneeling on the cold ground, Lu Xichan's previous fear vanished. Instead, a sense of nameless resistance surged in her heart.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Before this surge of flame grew, Lu Xichan saw a golden whip shadow flying towards her.</p><p></p><p>"Don't dodge!"</p><p></p><p>Her subconscious defense was halted by Li Fan's stern voice.</p><p></p><p>Then Lu Xichan could only watch as the golden soul whip struck her own soul.</p><p></p><p>The point of force was exactly where the defense prohibition had been washed away by the soul, and an indescribable pain spread throughout her body in an instant.</p><p></p><p>It felt as if countless steel needles were rotating forcefully, stabbing into her body and brain. In a moment, all of Lu Xichan's consciousness was filled with pain.</p><p></p><p>Her body stiffened suddenly, then fell to the ground, twitching uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't even scream, only making intermittent sobbing sounds in her throat.</p><p></p><p>Her body twisted and curled up, and it took nearly half a stick of incense time for the excruciating pain from the depths of her soul to gradually fade.</p><p></p><p>Regaining a bit of consciousness, Lu Xichan attempted to plead for mercy.</p><p></p><p>But just as she had slightly recovered, Lu Xichan was instantly pulled back into hell!</p><p></p><p>This time, Lu Xichan's reaction was even more intense than before, tears streaming down her face, her noble demeanor no longer visible.</p><p></p><p>And upon hearing Lu Xichan's faint cries of pain, Xuan Sushe, who had been silent, also turned her head to sneakily glance over.</p><p></p><p>A hint of surprise flashed in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that Lu Xichan had never shown such behavior. Her tolerance level was quite high.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Sushe's slight movement had long been within Li Fan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>For now, he ignored her and waited for Lu Xichan to regain her senses.</p><p></p><p>This scene of punishment also made Xuan Sushe feel a bit frightened. She dared not move and waited in place.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Lu Xichan finally regained consciousness from the blankness in her mind.</p><p></p><p>Lying on the ground, she saw Li Fan standing tall. Lu Xichan's heart trembled instinctively.</p><p></p><p>After that, she struggled to get up, first tidying herself up, and then slowly and difficultly bowed down, saying, "Thank you for punishing me, Master."</p><p></p><p>"Rise," Li Fan responded indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xichan tried to stand up but almost fell down again.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xuan Sushe hurried forward to support her.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao is boundless, pursue it relentlessly until death. These three whips are my punishment for your negligence!"</p><p></p><p>"The way of formations is like rowing against the current, if you do not advance, you will retreat. For the time being, stay in this Bamboo Sea, immerse yourself in the study of formations, and do not run around unless necessary!"</p>

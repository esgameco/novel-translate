        <h1>Chapter 838</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>With the joint efforts of three people, the defensive line of inkstone, which appeared like a wall of despair, finally showed a slight loosening.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang and Lin Ling finally broke out of the encirclement.</p><p></p><p>Countless inkstones eventually merged back together.</p><p></p><p>After scanning around and not finding Lin Ling and the others hiding or resting, she hesitated for a moment and then acted again.</p><p></p><p>After the full force attacks of the previous two moves, the strength of the inkstone had already been significantly weakened. However, this strike still exceeded the estimates of the three present.</p><p></p><p>The body of the inkstone began to slowly dissolve.</p><p></p><p>Endless black liquid flowed out from her body.</p><p></p><p>And spread outwards.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the flowing liquid kept increasing, seemingly endless.</p><p></p><p>In no time, it filled the area around her completely!</p><p></p><p>However, it did not slow down.</p><p></p><p>The black flowing liquid, like towering waves, roared and swept, determined to fill all the underground spaces here!</p><p></p><p>"We can't wait, we have to fight her!" Li Fan said in a deep voice to Tianyang and Lin Ling, who had regained some strength.</p><p></p><p>It was still Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>Taking the lead.</p><p></p><p>Transformed into a ball of flowing fire, without hesitation, rushed towards the black sea ahead.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recognized that Tianyang was truly fighting with all his might.</p><p></p><p>By burning his puppet body, he temporarily raised his strength to the level of Harmony. (69shu.com)</p><p></p><p>"Either succeed or meet a hero's end!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lin Ling also gritted her teeth and charged forward.</p><p></p><p>In the underground space, the phantom of a towering tree flickered in and out of sight.</p><p></p><p>The tree's shadow swayed slightly and caused numerous leaves to release.</p><p></p><p>Forming countless green laser beams, for a moment, the black sea parted.</p><p></p><p>Numerous roots extended, with some drilling into the endless black water.</p><p></p><p>The black sea surged, trying to engulf the roots.</p><p></p><p>But for the time being, unsuccessful.</p><p></p><p>Some of the roots crossed space and plunged into Tianyang's body.</p><p></p><p>The red flowing fire transformed into by Tianyang instantly surged.</p><p></p><p>The raging red flames even seemed to have the momentum to press down the black liquid for a while.</p><p></p><p>"These two people, indeed work together quite well." Li Fan nodded in approval to himself.</p><p></p><p>He refined the end-disintegrating array derived again, causing the inkstone to weaken once more.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang grew more courageous as the battle went on.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, in the underground space, the area occupied by the red flowing fire exceeded the black sea for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew that victory was only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later.</p><p></p><p>The inkstone, who had no way to escape, was eventually worn out alive by Li Fan and the other two.</p><p></p><p>The flames that took over the entire underground space suddenly contracted.</p><p></p><p>Forming a shadow of a person shaped like a lake.</p><p></p><p>Although it was a close victory, Tianyang's puppet body had been burned to almost nothing during the battle. (69shu.com)</p><p></p><p>The day when the flames would burn out completely would also be the day of Tianyang's fall.</p><p></p><p>But with the nourishment of the Soul of Heaven and Earth, it was different.</p><p></p><p>A constantly flowing black liquid was extracted by Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>This instant sparked not only greed in Li Fan's heart but also some fluctuation in Lin Ling, who had already reached the level of Harmony and wasn't particularly desirous.</p><p></p><p>So, neither of them made any undue movements and just quietly watched as Tianyang absorbed the moving black liquid into his fiery body.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it was as if being infused with ink.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang's body changed from fiery red to ink red.</p><p></p><p>And compared to before, the area occupied by the ink color increased slightly.</p><p></p><p>Only thin red lines were left, like tattoos, engraved on Tianyang's body.</p><p></p><p>A powerful pressure suddenly emanated from Tianyang's body.</p><p></p><p>Spreading outwards.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling couldn't help but retreat slightly.</p><p></p><p>A new Harmony Immortal was born!</p><p></p><p>The surrounding void dissolution caves trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Revealing a trend of spreading in all directions.</p><p></p><p>After adapting to his new body, Tianyang also retracted his pressure.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, he suppressed the turbulence in the numerous void dissolution caves here.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Tianyang looked at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The ink gradually faded, not completely disappearing but becoming a bit darker.</p><p></p><p>Although it still looked a bit awkward, it was much better than before.</p><p></p><p>"Master... Brother."</p><p></p><p>"I... did it."</p><p></p><p>His voice was still somewhat strange, but compared to before, there was clearly a bit more humanity to it.</p><p></p><p>"Good, well done!" After many twists and turns, Tianyang finally stepped into the Harmony realm.</p><p></p><p>Having an extra Harmony combatant like Tianyang, Li Fan was very pleased.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan started to dismantle the Spirit Sealing Formation while giving instructions.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang nodded without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Using the inkstone's inherited abilities, he repaired the perforated caves underground.</p><p></p><p>The efficiency was significantly faster than the inkstone's.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan had erased any traces and observed for a while, he called a halt.</p><p></p><p>"If the remaining void dissolution caves here were to erupt simultaneously, what would be the consequences?" Li Fan asked after scanning the area with his divine senses.</p><p></p><p>His control of spatial abilities was now much better.</p><p></p><p>And with Tianyang's condition returning somewhat to normal after reaching Harmony, he pondered for a moment before replying, "If I were to detonate these caves one by one, it would cause the mountains and rivers of this region to continuously shake."</p><p></p><p>"However, if the release of power is staggered and distributed, the earth will not collapse instantly."</p><p></p><p>"Just gradually sink."</p><p></p><p>"By refining my control further, people on the surface would at most feel a sudden tremor."</p><p></p><p>"And the subsequent impacts would only involve the tremors lasting for a while."</p><p></p><p>Tianyang explained carefully.</p><p></p><p>At first, it was a bit intermittent.</p><p></p><p>But as he went on, it became more fluent.</p><p></p><p>Almost indistinguishable from a normal person.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"Then, after we leave, create a bit of a commotion. Attract the attention of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, don't be noticed," Li Fan instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, Master." Tianyang nodded.</p><p></p><p>Soon, black fine lines flew out from Tianyang's body.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, they covered the entire underground space.</p><p></p><p>Each had their own tasks.</p><p></p><p>Some reduced the void dissolution caves, while others enlarged the holes.</p><p></p><p>However, after Tianyangâ€™s actions, the previously irregular and chaotic underground dissolution cave space began to show some kind of orderly arrangement.</p><p></p><p>It took more than a month before they finally completed everything.</p><p></p><p>"Master, we can leave now."</p><p></p><p>"Tianyang's talent is indeed outstanding. In such a short time, he has mastered the abilities of the inkstone so excellently."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan praised silently to himself.</p><p></p><p>As if perfectly controlled demolition.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan and the others left.</p>

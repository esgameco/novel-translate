        <h1>Chapter 856</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Sitting on the endless expanse of stars, Ji Shaoli pondered on this question.</p><p></p><p>"From the faint glance of the amazing swan, you can see that within these clusters of light, there should be items, martial arts techniques, techniques or supernatural powers, combat experiences, and other existences."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"This fishing pond may be a treasure that sets a certain threshold and specializes in awarding rewards."</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept across the different light clusters of white, blue, purple, and orange, Ji Shaoli deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>"The more valuable things are, the higher their level. So, attracting them will be more difficult."</p><p></p><p>"But now, I only have residual consciousness. Even if I want to attract those white light clusters, it will all depend on luck. Not to mention even higher-level light clusters."</p><p></p><p>After trying various methods, Ji Shaoli still couldn't attach the "bait" to the falling fishing line.</p><p></p><p>And his luck was truly bad.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, not even a white light cluster was attracted by him.</p><p></p><p>And in this starry sky, there seemed to be a time limit.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding starlight became dimmer and dimmer, as if layers of ripples dissipated, and Ji Shaoli returned to the real world.</p><p></p><p>The fishing result this time unexpectedly ended with an empty rod!</p><p></p><p>Frustrated, Ji Shaoli immediately prepared to cast another line. But he remembered with regret that there was only one chance per day to activate the power of fishing the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>He could only take a deep breath and wait for the arrival of tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>For the next ten days, Ji Shaoli participated in fishing once a day.</p><p></p><p>He only caught a total of six light clusters.</p><p></p><p>Five white and one blue.</p><p></p><p>In the white light clusters, there were only some ores, spirit herbs, and similar items.</p><p></p><p>They didn't hold much value.</p><p></p><p>However, in the blue light cluster, a jade slip was revealed.</p><p></p><p>"Golden Sword Qi of Tai Kang Geng?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli carefully read the contents of the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed not something from the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>This "Golden Sword Qi of Tai Kang Geng" originates from the domain of Taiyi and the Sword Sect's martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The Taiyi Realm is similar to the Xuanhuang Realm in general terms.</p><p></p><p>However, there are five great cultivators who have reached the pinnacle of cultivation but have not ascended to the Immortal Realm, instead achieving transcendence with their bodies, merging with the heavenly dao of the Taiyi Realm. They are known as the Taiyi Five Emperors.</p><p></p><p>Tai Kang is one of these five emperors.</p><p></p><p>"With the power of Emperor Tai Kang, one can advance the sword technique all the way to the Dao Unity realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Why is it classified as blue quality?"</p><p></p><p>After reading the contents of the jade slip, Ji Shaoli couldn't help but feel astonished.</p><p></p><p>It was only after his attempt to cultivate the "Golden Sword Qi of Tai Kang Geng" that he realized.</p><p></p><p>Adaptation to circumstances.</p><p></p><p>This sword technique was specifically created based on the specific conditions of the Taiyi Realm. The necessary condition for cultivation was the power of Emperor Tai Kang.</p><p></p><p>However, the concept of "Tai Kang" doesn't exist in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this martial art could not be cultivated there. If it didn't possess the Dao Unity quality, it would probably fall into the category of white quality.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this fishing platform will reassess the value of items based on the environment?" Ji Shaoli couldn't help but marvel.</p><p></p><p>Although he had almost no harvest, Ji Shaoli was not angry.</p><p></p><p>He observed the fishing process of Zhong Shentong over the ten days.</p><p></p><p>Having touched the fishing platform earlier than him, Zhong Shentong seemed to have grasped some tricks.</p><p></p><p>Out of ten chances, none ended up empty.</p><p></p><p>Even though there were only eight white and two blue light clusters, it still far surpassed Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation, Ji Shaoli decided not to continue wasting his chances.</p><p></p><p>That day, when Zhong Shentong was about to go for a nap after dinner, his expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>A golden light shield enveloped the entire temple, including the fishing pond, with countless snake-like thunderbolts generating in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" A young temple boy who was washing dishes looked horrified.</p><p></p><p>"Liu Li, come behind me quickly!" Zhong Shentong grabbed the young temple boy and shielded him.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he took out a command flag and inserted it into the ground.</p><p></p><p>A muddy yellow energy formed a sphere, wrapping the two inside.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it? Can you come out for a chat?"</p><p></p><p>"There might be some misunderstanding!"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong said loudly.</p><p></p><p>But Ji Shaoli could clearly see that although he spoke in this manner, he had secretly taken out a wooden sword.</p><p></p><p>Even though Ji Shaoli's realm was higher than the other's, he still felt a hint of deadly crisis from this small sword.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli did not show himself, only coldly saying, "Fellow Zhong, if you don't want the matters of the fishing pond to become public knowledge."</p><p></p><p>"I advise you not to resist!"</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I don't have any malicious intent."</p><p></p><p>"As a fisherman, I am just as curious as you!"</p><p></p><p>This remark completely unsettled Zhong Shentong.</p><p></p><p>The biggest secret had been exposed, and Zhong Shentong was in complete disarray.</p><p></p><p>His facial expression kept changing, but in the end, he sheathed the wooden sword.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, please come out and meet me! What kind of cowardly hiding is this?" he said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, fellow Daoist Zhong, you don't know how many treasures I've obtained from that fishing pond in these ten days. But carelessly putting them to waste is not possible," Ji Shaoli was not swayed by his words, instead asking about the method to fish out higher-quality light clusters.</p><p></p><p>"Don't try to deceive me either; I'm well aware of what you've harvested in these ten days," Ji Shaoli said in a jesting tone.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong's heart sank completely.</p><p></p><p>For so many days, the other party had almost examined him thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>And he had remained completely unaware of it.</p><p></p><p>It was enough to illustrate that the other party's strength must surpass his own by far.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong inwardly cursed his carelessness.</p><p></p><p>With no other choice, he had to share his own insights that he had summarized.</p><p></p><p>"On the fishing platform, the more times you cast your line, the stronger the connection you build with it."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps there used to be other ways that directly increased the connection. However, now, you can only rely on repeated attempts and time."</p><p></p><p>"When the connection reaches a certain level, you can use your own 'intention' as bait to attract the light clusters around you."</p><p></p><p>"The light clusters seem to have spirituality and can perceive the contents of the mental bait."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong honestly confessed.</p><p></p><p>While Ji Shaoli carefully listened, he also discerned the truth in his words.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry about deceiving me; try it yourself, and you'll know."</p><p></p><p>"Since the day I discovered the secret of this fishing pond, I knew that I couldn't monopolize it forever."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>"I can only hope that you spare Liu Li's life. If you want to kill, just kill me," he pleaded.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Ji Shaoli finally revealed his figure.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, fellow Zhong, you should put away your treasures."</p><p></p><p>"I have no intention of monopolizing the secret of this place."</p><p></p><p>At his words, Zhong Shentong looked skeptical.</p>

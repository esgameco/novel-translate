            <p>He just pointed to the "End Times Disc" above his head and asked lightly, "Do you five seniors need this thing?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu was stunned for a moment, then couldn't help but nod repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Before coming, the organization has already made it clear. Fair trade, one disc in exchange for a real temptation fruit," Xu Bai said with pride.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu nodded slightly and did not think that Xu Bai was asking for too much. In fact, he thought that with this kind of trading method, they, the five seniors, would be greatly benefiting.</p><p></p><p>He looked greedily at the End Times Disc and said, "There shouldn't be a problem. However, I still need to report to the superiors and confirm."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Xu Bai handed over another End Times Disc and said, "You should carry this with you. Now, the outside is full of the eyes of the Tianxuan Mirror. If you accidentally expose it, it won't be good."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Xu Bai detailed the instructions for using the End Times Disc.</p><p></p><p>There was a glint of excitement in Liu Wenyu's eyes, and he felt somewhat grateful towards Xu Bai. "Friend, your consideration is thorough. At this critical moment of disadvantage, our two families should join forces to get through the difficulties."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai waved his hand, "Go ahead. Go and come back quickly, I'll be waiting here."</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu nodded and turned into a streak of light, disappearing.</p><p></p><p>In less than half an hour, he hurried back.</p><p></p><p>"The authorities have agreed to trade with you. However, there is one question, how many of these 'Sky Covering Discs' can your Futen Society provide?" Liu Wenyu asked.</p><p></p><p>"This item is not easy to refine, and we don't have enough in our organization. New 69 Book → 69shux.com," Xu Bai said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>This was within Liu Wenyu's expectation, however, the next words from Xu Bai shocked him.</p><p></p><p>"At most, we can only distribute a few hundred to you," Xu Bai sighed, sounding somewhat helpless.</p><p></p><p>"So many?!" Liu Wenyu's face revealed a look of astonishment, exclaiming.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a sense of regret surged through him.</p><p></p><p>He realized that perhaps the "Sky Covering Disc" was not as precious as he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>"Too many? Then let's change it to one hundred. Anyway, if the five seniors don't want it, there are plenty of cultivators who do." Xu Bai snorted coldly, stating directly.</p><p></p><p>"Saying a few hundred, of course, it will have to be delivered in batches. Do you think this thing is like grass on the ground, that can grow just by watering it?" </p><p></p><p>"Not many. Not many," Liu Wenyu said repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"But, we don't have such a large inventory of 'Real Temptation Fruits'..." Liu Wenyu felt a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"Just as before, any valuable items will do." Xu Bai waved his hand, "Even so, if needed, we at Futen Society can lend you a batch of Sky Covering Discs first."</p><p></p><p>"However, the organization believes that perhaps we need to further strengthen cooperation between us." Xu Bai said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Strengthen cooperation?" Liu Wenyu frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Since the establishment of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, the establishment of the Wansheng Mansion, and the changes in the Tianxuan Mirror, the situation has quickly deteriorated. If the Wansheng Tianzun has deviated from reason, it is truly irretrievable. New 69 Book → 69shux.com However, in the face of the Tianxuan Mirror scanning the various small worlds of Xuanyellow and wanting to ascend, you five seniors are still indifferent..."</p><p></p><p>"With five heavenly beings present, surely you can come up with some countermeasures?" Xu Bai asked with great dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly are you doing?" </p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu hesitated to speak.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, he looked somewhat dejected and said, "Regarding this matter, not only you, my friend, but I also have many doubts in my heart."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, I can take the opportunity of this transaction to inquire and clarify." His expression was inexplicable.</p><p></p><p>"Urgent situation, the faster the transaction, the better. Three days later, outside Tianliang City, on Mount Wuliang." </p><p></p><p>After setting the location for the transaction, Liu Wenyu prepared to bid farewell and leave.</p><p></p><p>"Don't forget to count the Sky Covering Disc I gave you earlier in the trading list." Upon hearing Xu Bai's words, Liu Wenyu's pace slowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>But then he quickened his pace.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Xu Bai also walked out of the room slowly, turning into a streak of light, heading towards an unknown destination.</p><p></p><p>Mount Wuliang.</p><p></p><p>Since the incident of the Infinite Wall devouring cultivators, the already seldom-visited Mount Wuliang became even more desolate.</p><p></p><p>There were not many cultivators who understood the fundamental nature of the Infinite Wall.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with the fact that most cultivators were now conquering small worlds to earn merit.</p><p></p><p>There were even fewer cultivators venturing here.</p><p></p><p>After all, one could be reborn even after death, but being devoured by the Infinite Wall was a different story.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai quietly arrived at the bottom of the Mount Wuliang valley and looked at the mirror-smooth Infinite Wall from afar, patiently waiting.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that it was you who rescued Guan Zhang from the Infinite Wall the last time?" Suddenly, a voice sounded from behind Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai was startled.</p><p></p><p>Turning around, he saw a middle-aged cultivator in a purple-gold Taoist robe who appeared beside him out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>Silently observing the Infinite Wall, the cultivator did not look at Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>But it was obvious that it was this purple-gold cultivator who had just spoken.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's heart suddenly became tense.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Dao Immortal Venerable!</p><p></p><p>"Senior, it was me who fortunately rescued Guan Changge. Xu Bai answered respectfully.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, thoughts raced through Xu Bai's mind as he speculated about the identity of the other party.</p><p></p><p>At this time, appearing at this location.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation level as a Heavenly Dao Immortal Venerable.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't be a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>"Could he be the contact person for the transaction of the Futen Society this time?" Xu Bai couldn't help but speculate.</p><p></p><p>"A Heavenly Dao Immortal Venerable, actually a spy among the five seniors..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the identity of the purple-gold cultivator in front of him was revealed.</p><p></p><p>Purple Vault Immortal Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Commander-in-Chief of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance's Warrior Hall.</p><p></p><p>Even though Xu Bai had known about his spy identity from his experiences in past lives, he was still somewhat startled when the Purple Vault Immortal Venerable suddenly appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>Without revealing his identity first, Xu Bai tentatively asked, "I wonder, Senior..."</p><p></p><p>"I am here on behalf of the Five Elders Association to trade with your Futen Society." Unexpectedly, the Purple Vault Immortal Venerable directly stated without any reservation.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Xu Bai fell into a deep silence.</p><p></p><p>Unable to determine the other's intentions, Xu Bai was pondering on countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, it was just a clone, so Xu Bai wasn't too flustered.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you have recognized my identity? Interesting. I have been stationed at the headquarters of the Warrior Hall for many years and have not gone out," the Purple Vault remarked with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>"Your Futen Society is indeed remarkable."</p><p></p><p>Glancing at Xu Bai, the Purple Vault smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior's praise is excessive. It's just that I was suddenly shocked to know the Senior's true identity. I am not sure what to say." Xu Bai arched his hand, looking very nervous.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>There is a popular scene voting, please vote for Sky Doctor, thank you all!</p><p></p><p>Voting method: Click on the activity icon on the client side, search for "My Simulated Longevity Road," find the option with the highest votes, and vote.</p><p></p><p>You can vote three times a day, and after voting, you can participate in the lucky draw.

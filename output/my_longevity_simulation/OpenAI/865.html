        <h1>Chapter 865</h1>

            <p>After a moment of silence, he spoke in an inexplicable tone.</p><p></p><p>"Even if there are still knots in your heart, what's the point of competing with the dead?" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly shocked. </p><p></p><p>"The Bureau of Crossing Calamities of the past no longer exists in this world," the Stone Tablet Scholar said with a hint of emotion. </p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Eye is just executing their final orders."</p><p></p><p>"The Bureau of Crossing Calamities is gone?" Li Fan was shaken by this news.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's disbelief, the Stone Tablet Scholar smiled slightly and nodded, confirming, "Absolutely true. The dead cannot die again."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be a decoy to evade disasters?" </p><p></p><p>The long-standing feigned enemy, the elusive shadow behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>Had already been completely wiped out.</p><p></p><p>Finding it hard to accept for a moment, Li Fan, who had been battling with shadows, could not help but ask, "Is it possible they used an illusion to escape disaster?" </p><p></p><p>The Scholar chuckled, "The Great Law Sovereign personally took action. There is no chance of the Bureau of Crossing Calamities surviving. It was acknowledged by all sects back then."</p><p></p><p>"But your Union of Ten Thousand Realms is relatively young, so it's normal not to know." </p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"After the Great Law defied the laws of heaven and earth and achieved the title of the Immortal Sovereign, he rarely took action. Eradicating the Bureau of Crossing Calamities was one of the few times. Even fleeing beyond the realms couldn't escape the fate of demise," the Stone Tablet Scholar said with some emotion.</p><p></p><p>"Although the masterminds are dead, the destruction caused cannot be undone. We can only let the Heavenly Eye preserve it."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, if you don't pay attention to it usually, you won't even notice it. So, it's better not to dwell on it. Moreover, in a hundred thousand years, these paper figures will dissipate on their own due to the passage of time. So, everyone doesn't really pay much attention to it."</p><p></p><p>The Scholar explained earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan understood the situation.</p><p></p><p>Again comparing the Xuanhuang Realm to a house, just like before.</p><p></p><p>After the defiance of the laws of heaven and earth, the Immortal Sovereign became a part of the house. </p><p></p><p>However, due to a moment of negligence, this house had been filled with monitors. Cameras filled every room, and they weren't pleasing to the eye.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, when these monitors were installed, they were all connected to the main structure of the house.</p><p></p><p>If they wanted to remove them, it would inevitably cause irreversible damage to the house.</p><p></p><p>Already wandering between life and death outside the Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>This was something that the cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm couldn't bear.</p><p></p><p>So, despite their inner resentment, they could only begrudgingly accept this fact.</p><p></p><p>Fuming with anger, the Great Law Sovereign, who regarded himself as the owner of the house, personally took action and killed the Bureau of Crossing Calamities that had installed the monitors.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had carefully thought it through, fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>"Why would the Bureau of Crossing Calamities do this?" </p><p></p><p>A trace of reminiscence flashed in the eyes of the Stone Tablet Scholar.</p><p></p><p>"Those guys were always mysterious. Who can truly know what they had in their minds?"</p><p></p><p>"However, what can be certain is that they probably foresaw the consequences of their actions."</p><p></p><p>"Yet they persisted." </p><p></p><p>"I'm also quite curious," the Scholar said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the departed are gone. Perhaps this mystery will never be unravelled."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked solemn.</p><p></p><p>From the words spoken by the Scholar and his demeanor since his appearance, it was clear that the Scholar was a powerful cultivator who had survived from ancient times.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask for the senior's name?" Li Fan asked respectfully.</p><p></p><p>The Scholar did not conceal it, "I'm the one without a name among the Ten Daoist Sects."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>While searching for information about the Ten Daoist Sects in the past, no matter how hard he tried, he could only find the names of nine sects.</p><p></p><p>The last one had no record.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had once thought that the Ten Daoist Sects was just a conventional term, or perhaps one of the sects had been extinguished.</p><p></p><p>Never did he imagine that today he would encounter the last, most mysterious, and nameless sect!</p><p></p><p>"So, the one without a name among the ten sects is me..."</p><p></p><p>"Similar to Master Zhao, one person represents one sect?"</p><p></p><p>Although the Scholar in front of him seemed harmless, Li Fan was on high alert, for this was probably the second powerful person he had truly encountered in the realm of the Immortal Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan looking wary, the Stone Tablet Scholar shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to be so nervous. I'm not concerned about the conflicts between the Five Elders Council and the Union of Ten Thousand Immortals. Even the destruction of the Xuanhuang Realm doesn't really interest me."</p><p></p><p>"If one day, the Xuanhuang Realm were truly destroyed in an instant, I'd definitely be the first to applaud," the Scholar seemed to imply something.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the stone tablet he carried behind him, the Scholar's expression turned complex.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the other party did not seem to be lying and harbored no ill intentions, Li Fan became a bit bolder.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, about this stone tablet..."</p><p></p><p>"In ancient times, cultivators often used methods to steal the longevity of heaven and earth, like fruits of the trees. However, I accidentally obtained this stone tablet. With it, I can exist alongside heaven and earth for countless years," the Scholar's tone carried a sense of vicissitudes and fatigue.</p><p></p><p>"This item is called the Creation Stone Tablet. It automatically records every event in the Xuanhuang Realm in minute detail."</p><p></p><p>"People consider it a treasured artifact and want to snatch it from me."</p><p></p><p>"I couldn't seek it, yet no one could take it from me."</p><p></p><p>"Friend from the Union, would you like to give it a try?" the Scholar asked sincerely.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was shaken.</p><p></p><p>Every event in the Xuanhuang Realm would automatically be recorded?</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't this be the ultimate fusion and enhancement of the blood lineage records combined with the Heavenly Eye of Observation?</p><p></p><p>If he could obtain it, all the secrets from the past to the present would be within his grasp.</p><p></p><p>What a blessing that would be!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly felt his mouth go dry.</p><p></p><p>However, he still had some rationality left in him.</p><p></p><p>Facing the Scholar's inquiry, Li Fan dared not be impulsive and shook his head repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Feeling somewhat disappointed, the Stone Tablet Scholar explained, "I did not lie. Trying it out wouldn't hurt."</p><p></p><p>Although the other spoke very sincerely, Li Fan still refused to listen.</p><p></p><p>The Scholar shook his head with a tinge of desolation and did not push further.</p><p></p><p>"People nowadays are becoming more and more timid," the Scholar commented.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes, pretending not to have heard.</p><p></p><p>After a while, seeing that the Scholar did not mention it again, Li Fan asked, "Senior, with your identity, why did you suddenly come to meet me?"</p><p></p><p>The Stone Tablet Scholar stared at Li Fan, a hint of amusement in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I've come for you," the Scholar said.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart tightened, "Senior, please don't scare me. I'm just a small Qi Refining cultivator, how could I be noticed by you?" </p><p></p><p>"Although the Creation Stone Tablet can record everything in the world,"</p>

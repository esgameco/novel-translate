        <h1>Chapter 913</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Ever since the last time he was almost unsuccessful in dealing with the heavenly doctor's "inspection through observation, listening, questioning, and palpation," Li Fan had already rehearsed countless times in his mind the strategies for when he met the heavenly doctor again.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in the blink of an eye, Li Fan had already made what he considered to be the most correct choice.</p><p></p><p>His mind was empty, his thoughts seemed to freeze in place.</p><p></p><p>However, this abnormal behavior instantly caught the attention of the heavenly doctor.</p><p></p><p>First, he lightly pointed towards Han Zhong, and in a flash, a few traces of silver light arrived.</p><p></p><p>Like silver needles, they sealed Han Zhong in the space.</p><p></p><p>Han Zhong's expression froze, even his thoughts were frozen at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Then, the heavenly doctor looked towards Li Fan with his murky gaze, a hint of amusement on his face: "Being so cautious..."</p><p></p><p>"Young one, have we met before?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't even think, his subconscious reaction had already been made.</p><p></p><p>"Don't waste words. Traitors like you, everyone should kill!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face was full of righteousness as he shouted in anger.</p><p></p><p>Then, he consecutively released several shots of the Great Five Elements Annihilation Sword Light!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in these black sword lights, the essence of the Heaven Demonic Sword intention was greatly increased!</p><p></p><p>Facing the incoming sword light, the heavenly doctor did not dodge.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the familiar sword intention, a hint of fluctuation appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Without showing any movement, the previously straight trajectories of the hundreds of black sword lights began to bend on their own.</p><p></p><p>They all converged into the left hand extended by the heavenly doctor.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly doctor casually molded the swords into a black sphere, and Li Fan lost control over them.</p><p></p><p>This astonishing technique made Li Fan's heart jump.</p><p></p><p>This time, it was not a pretense.</p><p></p><p>But he quickly realized and continued his act.</p><p></p><p>"You old thief!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing his attacks being easily blocked, Li Fan looked resentful and angry.</p><p></p><p>Then, he pointed towards the heavenly doctor's forehead, but his figure simultaneously turned into escape light and recoiled.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan was horrified to find that the previously small room of Han Zhong had suddenly become infinitely large. No matter how he fled, he couldn't leave!</p><p></p><p>"Heaven Killing Sword, Cloud Water Illusory Dream Skill..."</p><p></p><p>"What else do you know?"</p><p></p><p>Facing Li Fan's repeated insults and rudeness, the heavenly doctor did not get angry.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he looked at Li Fan with a complex gaze and slowly asked.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, damned thief!" Feeling that he was no match for the heavenly doctor, Li Fan gave up arguing.</p><p></p><p>Scornfully spitting towards the heavenly doctor, he said righteously, "Hmph..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph..." The heavenly doctor shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Yet he was not surprised by Li Fan's performance.</p><p></p><p>"So many years have passed, and they haven't changed at all. Still hate me so much..."</p><p></p><p>The heavenly doctor chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was furious: "Blood feud, will never change even after a thousand years!"</p><p></p><p>"Young man. If I say I'm a good person, do you believe it?" The heavenly doctor did not get angry but smiled as he looked at Li Fan, asking.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully scrutinized the heavenly doctor again.</p><p></p><p>With his white hair and kind eyes, looking at his appearance alone, he indeed seemed unrelated to villains.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan still coldly snorted, "Old thief, don't try to deceive me! Recognizing people by their faces, not their hearts!"</p><p></p><p>The heavenly doctor sighed in dismay, then asked, "If you can believe words from a madman, why can't you believe me?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan could speak, the heavenly doctor continued, "If I were really a bad person, could I have let Tian Jue live until now? He can't figure things out, can you?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression suddenly froze, as if caught in deep thought. He seemed somewhat puzzled by the heavenly doctor's words.</p><p></p><p>"Sometimes things are not as simple as they seem. Even what you see with your own eyes is not so straightforward," the heavenly doctor sighed, his tone filled with endless desolation.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained silent, apparently not easily swayed by the heavenly doctor's words.</p><p></p><p>However, the heavenly doctor seemed unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, I will soon resolve everything thoroughly."</p><p></p><p>Seemingly speaking to Li Fan, yet also to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, you have good character, just too impulsive. Be careful in your actions in the future, plan before acting," the heavenly doctor remarked, sounding as if giving advice to a child.</p><p></p><p>Then, he conjured up a jade slip out of thin air and threw it at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>This jade slip did not look ordinary, with nine sacred golden lights surrounding it. When it flew through the air, it even caused layers of space to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan subconsciously caught the golden jade slip and looked at the heavenly doctor with a face full of suspicion.</p><p></p><p>"Reading more books is always good for young people."</p><p></p><p>"Well, let me handle the official business."</p><p></p><p>The heavenly doctor did not pay attention to Li Fan's movements but turned his gaze to Han Zhong, who had been frozen in ice.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired elder narrowed his eyes, looking focused.</p><p></p><p>A silver needle quietly appeared in his right hand, and then he flicked it, shooting it towards Han Zhong's crown.</p><p></p><p>Ding!</p><p></p><p>The needle entered into his bone, and Han Zhong, who had been completely frozen, suddenly struggled fiercely.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly doctor remained unfazed and swiftly shot several more silver needles, firmly controlling Han Zhong.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Li Fan suppressed the urge to read the golden jade slip in his heart, with his mind empty.</p><p></p><p>He was watching the heavenly doctor's actions intently.</p><p></p><p>Once filled with ninety-nine silver needles, Han Zhong's face completely froze, displaying a grotesque and contorted appearance. His eye sockets, mouth, and nostrils seemed to be corroded by something, melting into dark hollows.</p><p></p><p>An eerie, intangible aura flowed out from the voids in Han Zhong's body, even with the heavenly doctor's seal, Li Fan felt an intense sense of crisis for some reason.</p><p></p><p>His eyelids twitched as if a great disaster was looming!</p><p></p><p>Quietly moving behind the heavenly doctor without showing any changes, the sense of crisis lessened slightly.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly doctor paid no attention to Li Fan's small movements and pulled out a jade bottle out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>Aiming the bottle's mouth at Han Zhong's head, he gently tossed it.</p><p></p><p>The jade bottle seemed to have the function of absorbing invisible auras. Gradually, the source of the sense of crisis in Li Fan's heart dissipated.</p><p></p><p>During this process, Han Zhong's body was completely turned into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Once everything was settled, the heavenly doctor solemnly retrieved and sealed the jade bottle.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Li Fan couldn't help but ask, looking at the jade bottle in the heavenly doctor's hand.</p><p></p><p>"This is a disease," the heavenly doctor sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>"This young lad, I wonder if his luck is good or bad. Finding the Eye of the Skydonkey, leaving the Profound Yellow Realm, and thus contracting this disease."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but recall the desolate and decaying phenomenon that occurred in his soul when he just had contact with Han Zhong.</p><p></p><p>"A disease?" Li Fan pondered.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Not a single bit was accepted.</p><p></p><p>But this was within Li Qing's expectations.</p><p></p><p>The wonder of the wooden sword was the pure principle of swordsmanship.</p><p></p><p>How could it easily accommodate other principles?</p><p></p><p>Li Qing was not discouraged, trying different methods.</p><p></p><p>Time passed slowly like this.</p><p></p><p>The black sword became more solid, its aura becoming stronger.</p><p></p><p>One day, the black sword, which had always strongly rejected foreign objects, suddenly absorbed a bit of Li Qing's insight!</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's eyes brightened as she quickly identified the presence that seemed to be able to merge with the black sword!</p><p></p><p>It turned out to be "clumsiness"!</p><p></p><p>"Hidden sharpness in clumsiness, the advantage of collecting the sword. By not being aggressive, one can achieve ultimate victory..."</p><p></p><p>In Li Qing's mind, an endless stream of inspiration burst forth.</p><p></p><p>Some images seemed familiar, but she didn't know where they came from.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Qing did not mind. Instead, she used the almost gushing inspiration to continuously infuse the black sword.</p><p></p><p>The previously aloof black sword, which was only interested in swordsmanship and nothing else, was now exceptionally cooperative.</p><p></p><p>It even seemed eager, actively accepting Li Qing's infusion.</p><p></p><p>As the way of clumsiness slowly merged in, the black sword, which was originally gradually taking shape and beginning to reveal its sharpness, slowly lost its edge.</p><p></p><p>It became dark and inconspicuous again. </p><p></p><p>But Li Qing knew that this was the black sword breaking free from the usual swordsmanship constraints, symbolizing a further breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>In the sword mound, the countless unclaimed swords remained unaware.</p><p></p><p>Only the central wonder of the wooden sword emitted a faint, almost invisible sword hum.</p><p></p><p>As if expressing its joy.</p><p></p><p>Because of this sword hum, the myriad swords bowed their heads once more. Only the black sword by Li Qing's side seemed to be bowing as well.</p><p></p><p>But stood motionless.</p><p></p><p>"It's done!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing knew that the next step to completely control the black sword, the wonder of the wooden sword, was not far away.</p><p></p><p>She closed her eyes, injecting the last essence of swordsmanship insight into the black sword.</p><p></p><p>After the wonder of the wooden sword hum, the sword mound fell into an increasingly silent state.</p><p></p><p>The silence was terrifying, and even in Li Qing's ears, there were various hallucinations.</p><p></p><p>As if the myriad unclaimed swords were whispering, tempting Li Qing to abandon the black sword and take other swords.</p><p></p><p>Scenes of swords destroying the heavens and earth, with their magnificent power, constantly appeared in Li Qing's mind.</p><p></p><p>Attempting to disturb Li Qing's determination.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Qing, who he was, could not be easily swayed.</p><p></p><p>He knew this might be a covert measure by the wonder of the wooden sword.</p><p></p><p>The reason may be it was reluctant to let go of the black sword and thus spontaneously obstructing it.</p><p></p><p>But, regardless, these tricks could not affect Li Qing in the end.</p><p></p><p>Facing the myriad illusions, Li Qing remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>Her mind and the black sword merged, with nothing else interfering.</p><p></p><p>Until three months later.</p><p></p><p>One day, Li Qing suddenly opened her eyes.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, she reached out her right hand and naturally gripped the hilt of the black sword.</p><p></p><p>Then she gently drew it.</p><p></p><p>There was no earth-shattering noise like a divine object emerging.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, there was not even a slight sound.</p><p></p><p>In the tranquil atmosphere, the black sword fell into Li Qing's hand like this.</p><p></p><p>The myriad unclaimed swords in the sword mound seemed completely unaware of this.</p><p></p><p>Even the central wonder of the wooden sword showed no sign of objection.</p><p></p><p>The silence in the sword mound indicated Li Qing's success.</p><p></p><p>"Creating a false wonder of heaven and earth to establish the foundation of the path."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing silently chanted in her heart, and then the essence of the black sword instantly turned into a faint light, merging into her body.</p><p></p><p>It flew into her elixir field and settled down.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, the spiritual power in Li Qing's body, at the perfection stage of the golden elixir realm, instantly boiled.</p><p></p><p>Like ten thousand streams rushing into the sea, all surged towards the black sword.</p><p></p><p>Under the surging spiritual power wash, the black sword gradually became ethereal.</p><p></p><p>Completely merging into Li Qing's elixir field, becoming her path foundation.</p><p></p><p>"To peek into the ways of heaven and earth to refine the golden elixir."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing chanted in her heart again.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming spiritual power continued to rush towards the foundation formed by the black sword.</p><p></p><p>In the vortex of spiritual power, the shadow of the black sword became more and more obscure.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, dissolving completely but seemed to form an abyss, engulfing all the spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A bright light erupted, like the radiance when the world was first created.</p><p></p><p>Illuminating Li Qing's body completely.</p><p></p><p>The light flickered, lasting for a few breaths of time.</p><p></p><p>When the dazzling light finally faded away, a completely black, exuding an ancient and simple aura, the unique golden elixir appeared in Li Qing's elixir field.</p><p></p><p>If one looked closely, they could faintly see countless sword shadows on the black golden elixir.</p><p></p><p>But as if facing darkness, the illusion disappeared upon closer inspection.</p><p></p><p>A golden elixir was formed in just a few breaths of time.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing, who was originally just an empty shell in the perfect stage of the golden elixir realm, had now become a genuine golden elixir cultivator who had formed a foundation and achieved elixir using the wonder of the black sword.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Qing was not satisfied.</p><p></p><p>In her mind, Li Qing continued to chant.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary cultivators needed a blessed cave to reach the Nascent Soul realm, but those who established the foundation with the wonder of the heavens did not need it.</p><p></p><p>Because the wonder of the heavens is a part of the heavenly path.</p><p></p><p>It could completely evolve oneself into a blessed cave!</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's mind moved, and the black golden elixir that had just formed exploded instantly.</p><p></p><p>The aura inside diffused and spread throughout Li Qing's body.</p><p></p><p>The numerous black golden elixir fragments immediately flew to various parts of her body in an apparently random distribution but concealing profound reasoning!</p><p></p><p>The distribution of the golden elixir fragments could vaguely reveal the original appearance of the black sword!</p><p></p><p>With these remnants as a foundation, Li Qing's spiritual energy, flesh and blood, tendons, bones, everything in her body began to melt like liquid, absorbed by these remnants.</p><p></p><p>Externally, Li Qing instantly appeared like a puppet torn asunder, becoming malformed and distorted.</p><p></p><p>Even with the terrifying sound of flesh and blood being forcibly extracted, along with the hideous appearance caused by the squeezing of flesh and muscles.</p><p></p><p>All of this seemed sinister and magical.</p><p></p><p>Facing the surging pain, Li Qing didnâ€™t care.</p><p></p><p>She only accelerated the process of the golden elixir remnants devouring her body.</p><p></p><p>When all the remains of her flesh and blood in the air were completely absorbed.</p><p></p><p>The scattered golden elixir fragments seemed to form a network of meridians.</p><p></p><p>Interconnected with threads of dark red tissues, eerie and mesmerizing.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a beam of light simultaneously emerged in the golden elixir remnants.</p><p></p><p>Then, the body transformed in an instant.</p>

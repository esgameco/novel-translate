        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan's eyes lit up: "Right, this is the path I should take! Investing in cultivators is just a small side path. Only by absorbing the feedback brought about by the changes in the world, even the world's ascension, can one truly possess unparalleled power!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had not felt this excited in a long time, became more and more thrilled as he thought about it: "Even the transmission of laws is a force against the heavens, merging into the world's rules. Only then can there be detachment afterwards."</p><p></p><p>"It can be seen that the world's unparalleled power is indeed something cultivators cannot contend with."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Realm has been completely eroded by the transmission of laws, it can be said to be full of holes. Even if I want to benefit from it, it is extremely difficult."</p><p></p><p>"It can be said to be in a precarious situation by itself, I still want to use the feedback from Xuanhuang to cultivate..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head and temporarily cut off this thought.</p><p></p><p>"But the many small worlds captured by Xuanhuang are my perfect testing grounds."</p><p></p><p>"Just like the experience in this Spirit Wood Realm, where Shang Tian gave me the opportunity to transport the wonders of Xuanhuang, coupled with the replenishment of external resources and spiritual energy..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly stood up and took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it is the most suitable cultivation technique for me, unexpectedly in line with the plan I have had in this life all along."</p><p></p><p>"It truly seems that there is fate in the dark, it can be said that knowledge and action are one, the heart naturally completes itself."</p><p></p><p>With increasing certainty about the compatibility of the "Sitting Heaven Secret Technique" with himself, Li Fan had already decided on the path he wanted to strive for in the future.</p><p></p><p>The only current problem was how to derive and elevate the "Sitting Immortal Secret Technique" to the "Sitting Heaven Secret Technique."</p><p></p><p>"Although it is possible to once again derive the method through the Law-casting Stone, but..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan contemplated for a moment, still suppressing the temptation of gaining something for nothing.</p><p></p><p>"The Law-casting Stone technique, in the end, is nothing more than a miraculous item. It is very likely that the method of deriving techniques involves speculation, which can quickly achieve the desired target technique. However, that method is only most fitting for the person whose method is being cast within the Law-casting Stone."</p><p></p><p>"And not the true me in reality. Unless I am willing to release all the secrets in my body and soul, allowing the Law-casting Stone to fully understand everything."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was naturally impossible to do such a thing.</p><p></p><p>"So to strive for the perfect Sitting Heaven Secret Technique, I still have to rely on myself."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan came to this conclusion.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, although Li Fan's understanding was still decent, wanting to derive a groundbreaking technique based on the power of world changes and ascension...</p><p></p><p>was still far from enough!</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan had no worries at all that he couldn't achieve this.</p><p></p><p>If not in this life, then in ten lives. Even if not in ten lives...</p><p></p><p>He could still learn from others!</p><p></p><p>The geniuses of the Xuanhuang Realm were like fish in troubled waters, as long as they could derive and think of it, all the divine abilities and techniques would ultimately belong to Li Fan!</p><p></p><p>Returning to the year when everything was anchored, everything they pondered and thought about would be secrets that only Li Fan alone would possess.</p><p></p><p>"In order to derive the Sitting Heaven Secret Technique, I am willing to share the Sitting Immortal Secret Technique with others."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I must choose the one with the highest understanding and most suitable candidate."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I have already planned for the next life, to truly hide in the shadows and verify my conjecture..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a vague plan in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, helping the myriad worlds ascend while collecting data this life."</p><p></p><p>Fully enlightened and integrated.</p><p></p><p>These eight words aptly described Li Fan's current state of mind.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivators will bring back feedback for cultivation. What surprises will the feedback from the world bring me..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but secretly anticipate in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Immersed in fantasies, he didn't realize how much time had passed.</p><p></p><p>A demonic thought from the "Three Disasters and Hundred Trials Bright Godly Law" suddenly emerged.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quickly located the divine demon.</p><p></p><p>It inhabited a Nascent Soul cultivator named Feng Qiruan.</p><p></p><p>This person was cautious, ever since obtaining the "Godly Descendence" secret technique, he had never revealed himself in public, solely focusing on cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But some things could not be avoided by caution alone.</p><p></p><p>That day, Feng Qiruan passed by a young man in blue robes.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, he was astonished to find that he had lost control of his body.</p><p></p><p>The young man in blue robes glanced carefully at Feng Qiruan, revealing a somewhat ridiculous expression.</p><p></p><p>Without saying a word, a line as deep as an abyss, yet shining like a mirror, appeared between Feng Qiruan and the young cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Under the dim and unclear light, it didn't take long for the young cultivator to become exactly like Feng Qiruan!</p><p></p><p>Reaching out towards the bewildered Feng Qiruan, the line burst open with a thunderous sound.</p><p></p><p>The two merged into one.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Feng Qiruan, through the divine demon left by Li Fan inside him, established a reverse connection with Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Without formal words, only a mysterious and secretive power infiltrated Li Fan's sea of consciousness through the invisible connection in the void.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had long sensed something abnormal and was not unprepared.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless divine demons appeared.</p><p></p><p>Sinister spirits descended into his consciousness, the eerie blood moon of the five celestial beings appeared in the sky, Li Fan revealed a ferocious face, staring at Feng Qiruan below, surrounded by countless demonic spirits.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you invade my consciousness..."</p><p></p><p>"You are truly seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan laughed wildly, about to launch an attack.</p><p></p><p>He had already seen through that the person in front of him, Feng Qiruan, was actually the Law King Moru bin from the Xuantian teaching.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know why Moru bin had changed his identity to a young law transmitter, and ventured out alone.</p><p></p><p>But at this time, he had not revealed his identity yet, so it was worth trying out Moru bin's mettle.</p><p></p><p>With no mercy, howling countless demons and spirits, Li Fan sprayed black rays of light towards Moru bin.</p><p></p><p>These were actualized attacks of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>It was not just Li Fan's personal strength, but also the extracted and borrowed spiritual power of the numerous practitioners who practiced the "Godly Descendence" technique.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with Li Fan's inherently extraordinary spiritual strength...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan believed that even if he faced a supreme immortal on the other side, they would be severely damaged!</p><p></p><p>"Just wait..."</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, before Moru bin could finish speaking, his consciousness incarnation was engulfed by a terrifying and destructive force.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't even resist for a moment, and was extinguished and expelled from Li Fan's sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Satisfied with his battle achievement, despite having a bit of a surprise attack, Li Fan still repelled the invasion of a powerful immortal.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the fatigue transmitted by the countless demons residing in the practitioners, Li Fan couldn't help but feel a bit regretful: "Unfortunately, I only have the power of a single strike, and it's not sustainable."</p><p></p><p>Without retracting his attention, Li Fan continued to wait for Moru bin's return.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan expected, it was only a retreat of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Moru bin had not given up on establishing a connection with Li Fan.</p>

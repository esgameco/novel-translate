        <h1>Chapter 752</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>On the face of the imperial princess flashed a hint of pride: "It is the latest research result of the empire."</p><p></p><p>"Over a hundred years ago, we found demonic cores inside certain strange beasts that could be absorbed and cultivated by cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"The power of the strange beasts' flesh and blood can actually generate spiritual energy crystals inside the body. Although the purity of the spiritual energy is very low, this phenomenon caught the attention of the previous emperor of the empire."</p><p></p><p>"After more than a hundred years of unremitting research, we have initially mastered the technique of synthesizing spiritual energy. Although it requires a large amount of flesh and blood as feed, the spiritual energy crystals we have cultivated have a purity close to that of top-grade spiritual stones in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Bai couldn't help but show a trace of surprise in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Carefully examining the "Soul Crystal Marrow" in front of him, he nodded slowly, "Impressive. With such means, as long as you are given enough time, I believe you can transform this realm into a small world suitable for cultivators to live in. But if it's just this, it still doesn't provide much help for the overall situation. Let alone our World Union, any reliable force in the Xuanhuang Realm won't be lacking in spiritual stones." Xu Bai said somewhat regretfully.</p><p></p><p>The imperial princess seemed to expect Xu Bai's reaction, "I naturally know this. If the role of the 'Soul Crystal Marrow' is only to provide spiritual energy, then I wouldn't have placed its importance after the ritual as well."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, the main function of the 'Soul Crystal Marrow' is to transfer various abilities belonging to the strange beasts to humans without any side effects."</p><p></p><p>A red light flashed and a round bead with flames swirling around it appeared in her palm.</p><p></p><p>"This is a 'Soul Crystal Marrow' made from a strange beast called 'Fierce Flame Tiger.' You might as well try its effect." The imperial princess handed the red bead confidently to Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>"Inheriting demonic beast abilities?" In an instant, Xu Bai thought of the ancient artifact that Dongfang Yao mentioned. The effect was similar, except it would awaken ancient bloodline abilities within oneself.</p><p></p><p>Holding the red Soul Crystal Marrow in his palm, Xu Bai exerted a bit of force.</p><p></p><p>Like a glass bead, it instantly shattered. In that moment, numerous red flames, like fiery dragons, drilled into his body along his arm.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>Before him appeared a raging demonic tiger composed of flames, emitting a roar of anger and unwillingness.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai snorted coldly, and the illusion shattered instantly.</p><p></p><p>After a stream of heat circulated inside his body and disappeared in his brow, Xu Bai closed his eyes to contemplate. After a moment, a red flame appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Constantly flickering, heating the surrounding air to distort.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's expression became serious.</p><p></p><p>Because this flame did not require any spiritual power or technique to be activated. It was an instinctual ability, almost like breathing.</p><p></p><p>It could be activated with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>The flame changed shape as Xu Bai manipulated it, and memories about how to use the flame ability emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Seeing how skillfully Xu Bai absorbed the Soul Crystal Marrow and mastered the abilities originally belonging to the strange beast, the imperial princess seemed extremely surprised.</p><p></p><p>As if afraid Xu Bai would misunderstand, she hastened to add, "In reality, inheriting the strength of the strange beasts through the 'Soul Crystal Marrow' is not always successful. It is not only related to personal aptitude and talent but also to the strength of the ability itself."</p><p></p><p>"According to our research, the more powerful and rare the ability, the harder it is for humans to control. And if one fails during the inheritance process, the probability of success next time will greatly decrease."</p><p></p><p>"There is also a limit to the number of abilities a single cultivator can inherit. The more abilities one has mastered, the smaller the probability of inheriting new abilities."</p><p></p><p>The imperial princess detailed the rules for using the 'Soul Crystal Marrow.'</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai, on the other hand, focused on the core issue, "How difficult is it to manufacture the 'Soul Crystal Marrow'? How many strange beasts are needed to produce one 'Soul Crystal Marrow'?"</p><p></p><p>The imperial princess, who had been speaking incessantly, suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>A hint of embarrassment appeared on her face, "It takes the flesh and blood of nearly a thousand strange beasts to produce one 'Soul Crystal Marrow.' However, the empire's cultivation technology is already very mature. If the resources are sufficient, there should be no problem with the output of 'Soul Crystal Marrow.'"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai nodded slightly, "Indeed, this can be considered a remarkable token. The power of the strange beasts is almost equivalent to a weakened version of divine abilities. In life-and-death battles, if used unexpectedly, it would be very effective."</p><p></p><p>"Besides that, are there any other surprises?" Xu Bai asked again.</p><p></p><p>The imperial princess hesitated, then slowly said, "This particular technology is still immature..."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine. What the Union values is potential. If there is truly unlimited potential, we will spare no effort in supporting it." Xu Bai assured her.</p><p></p><p>The imperial princess did not respond immediately, but turned her gaze to Xiaoyun outside the imperial treasury.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xiaoyun nod in agreement, she took a deep breath and led Xu Bai to the deepest part of the treasury.</p><p></p><p>There, a large metal furnace was placed.</p><p></p><p>Carved on the furnace were thousands of different kinds of strange beasts, vividly portrayed.</p><p></p><p>Even without visible flames, the furnace's temperature seemed extremely high.</p><p></p><p>Even with some distance between them, given Xu Bai's current strength, he could still slightly feel the scorching heat.</p><p></p><p>"Boom! Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Occasional intense collisions could be heard coming from the furnace.</p><p></p><p>Upon careful listening, one could faintly hear the intertwined cries of numerous strange beasts.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere was oppressive.</p><p></p><p>The imperial princess seemed to be very wary of the furnace; she stood farther away than Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>She explained in a low voice, "This item is called the 'Myriad Furnace.'"</p><p></p><p>"Its origin is a speculation, or rather, a fact."</p><p></p><p>"At the beginning of ancient times, all demon beasts and strange creatures in the world were said to have originated from the same body."</p><p></p><p>"That was the origin of all demon beasts, containing unimaginable power."</p><p></p><p>"Over countless years, a countless number of individuals separated from it."</p><p></p><p>"So, can we possibly reverse this process? Re-smelt all the strange beasts of the world back to... that original individual?"</p><p></p><p>A mysterious light shimmered in the imperial princess's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Even though we may not be able to know all the demon beasts that have appeared in the world, with enough variety found, we can barely create a weaker fusion entity."</p><p></p><p>"It should also be achievable."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, ten years ago, we briefly fused a terrifying demon beast."</p><p></p><p>"Its aura seemed even more terrifying than the phoenix under our feet. Everyone present at the time, including Qing and Hong, were so scared that they lost their ability to act."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, it didn't survive for long and dissolved on its own."</p>

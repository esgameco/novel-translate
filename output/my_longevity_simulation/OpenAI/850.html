His voice trembled a bit, asking again.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ji Shaoli finally came to his senses from his earlier astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Wei Qi's sudden changes in expression, Ji Shaoli immediately guessed what he was thinking.</p><p></p><p>He reassured, "You don't need to worry; our Mutual Assistance Association's secret technique has never failed."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"If you're still not at ease, I can help you again!

Empty your mind, dispel all distractions," Ji Shaoli instructed.</p><p></p><p>Wei Qi nodded and followed.</p><p></p><p>Soon, his anxious heart became calm.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli nodded to himself.</p><p></p><p>Then patiently waited.</p><p></p><p>As for what he was waiting for...</p><p></p><p>It was, of course, the storage ring that Lin Ling urgently rushed to deliver, eight hundred miles away, aided by the surging Earth Meridian's power. In just a short time, Lin Ling with Li Fan, arrived on Haixuan Island.</p><p></p><p>Without raising suspicions from other cultivators on the island.</p><p></p><p>The moment they entered the secret chamber, Lin Ling made Wei Qi faint.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan respectfully and his clone carefully inspected Wei Qi's body.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Li Fan shook his head slightly, "Strange. There's nothing particularly unique about his physique."</p><p></p><p>"Although his cultivation talent is outstanding, it is limited to the scope of a province. Compared to the true geniuses of the Profound Yellow World, there is still quite a gap."</p><p></p><p>"Why was he chosen by the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>But regardless of his confusion, it did not affect his actions.</p><p></p><p>The blue real inducement fruit that fluctuated between reality and illusion was placed on Wei Qi's forehead.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the inducement fruit completely dissolved into emptiness. This fruit, capable of controlling Daoist Masters in conjunction, was wasted on Wei Qi, who had just built his foundation!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not feel any regret.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was a slim possibility, he took the risk!</p><p></p><p>If Wei Qi really managed to pass the selection, knowing the truth of the Thirty-three Immortal Selectees' plan through him would be invaluable!</p><p></p><p>If he unfortunately failed...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression became somewhat dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Then Wei Qi would have to work for a lifetime to repay him.</p><p></p><p>"Just relying on this real inducement fruit is not enough."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>In the Sea of Consciousness, the End of Days Disintegration Disc emitted a radiant white light.</p><p></p><p>In the next instant, it appeared in Li Fan's hand.</p><p></p><p>After taking a deep breath, he swiftly laid down a formation around it and then, using his finger as a sword, he sliced it down abruptly.</p><p></p><p>In a slight tremor, the End of Days Disintegration Disc was cut into a thin layer.</p><p></p><p>As if suffering significant damage, the End of Days Disintegration Disc instantly dimmed.</p><p></p><p>It looked somewhat dejected.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan felt a bit regretful.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly retracted it into his Sea of Consciousness for nurturing.</p><p></p><p>"After all, it is not the End of Days Stone Disk but a fusion of the sliced round plate and disintegration disc."</p><p></p><p>"Although it inherits some characteristics allowing for cutting and separation, cutting just one piece is a strain."</p><p></p><p>"You better not disappoint me, young man."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully implanted the weakened End of Days Disintegration Disc into Wei Qi's Sea of Consciousness.</p><p></p><p>After completing everything, with Lin Ling leading the way, they quietly left the secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>Leaving behind his clone Ji Shaoli to stand silently waiting.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, Wei Qi slowly regained consciousness.</p><p></p><p>At first, he was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>But then, seeing Ji Shaoli beside him looking somewhat pale, many images suddenly appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Brother Ji."</p><p></p><p>"I will never forget your great favor, I will surely repay it!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Qi expressed his gratitude sincerely.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli waved his hand, saying, "We are all members of the Mutual Assistance Association, naturally we should help each other."</p><p></p><p>"It has been a long time since the Lord of the City summoned you. Go now."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, with our Mutual Assistance Association's secret technique, even if the Supreme Daoist intervenes, he won't discover the secrets in your mind!"</p><p></p><p>His tone was strong, but Wei Qi believed it unreservedly.</p><p></p><p>He nodded vigorously.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 996</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The so-called being born with desires, following the path, relentlessly pursuing it until death.</p><p></p><p>The golden wish power absorbed by Li Fan before he was possessed was just pure energy, without the belief of "following the path".</p><p></p><p>However, the golden wish power generated by Dao Xuanzi at this moment unexpectedly made Li Fan feel an extremely subtle desire for seeking the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Even though most of it was filtered out by the stone statue, the remaining residue among all the golden wish powers was as conspicuous as the bright moon in the sky, to the point that Li Fan clearly perceived it the moment it was generated.</p><p></p><p>"Sincerely seeking the Dao, achieving immortality through the Dao. Not ashamed to pursue the advancement of martial arts, just like the guy who fought to the death with his brother, chased all the way into the land of immortality."</p><p></p><p>"It may seem free on the surface, but the desire for seeking the Dao in the heart is so firm."</p><p></p><p>The desire to follow the path in the golden wish power only existed for a moment, and then disappeared instantly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt as if he had lost some kind of treasure and his heart suddenly felt empty.</p><p></p><p>But soon, as the spontaneous operation of the Xuanyellow Immortal Mind Mantra began, this inexplicable feeling of loss was quickly shattered.</p><p></p><p>"With the Canghai Bead in hand, Dao Xuanzi's future in this life looks promising. Even though Kou Hong learned about the other extraordinary item, the Ten Thousand Mountains Cauldron, he did not hurry to go there. Instead, he patiently accompanied Dao Xuanzi to successfully rebuild his foundation. These two brothers indeed have some friendship."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe I can take care of them more in the future..."</p><p></p><p>The short interlude ended, and Li Fan's attention returned to the Bamboo Sea in Tianquan Prefecture in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Silently, Lin Ling and the others had already sneaked into the Bamboo Sea under the cover of Li Fan and Moru Bin, where they laid an ambush.</p><p></p><p>They were just waiting for Xuan Sushang to take the bait.</p><p></p><p>As a major enemy was approaching, only Lin Ling seemed a bit nervous among the group. Tianyang was silent, and Baihua Dao Ren was a long-lived cultivator who survived the ancient calamity, well-versed in many matters. As for Li Fan and Moru Bin, they already considered this Fiery Snow Immortal Ancestor as their own prey.</p><p></p><p>Time passed slowly, and not long after...</p><p></p><p>Two rainbow lights came through the air, landing outside the Bamboo Sea.</p><p></p><p>The defensive formation of the Bamboo Sea was activated, and eighteen women in red long skirts walked out to welcome them.</p><p></p><p>The two figures, however, didn't even glance at them, walking straight into the cave in the Bamboo Sea.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Lü Xichan? Why is she here too?" Moru Bin was somewhat surprised but not panicked.</p><p></p><p>However, he still looked at Li Fan to seek his opinion, "Are you sure?"</p><p></p><p>He already transmitted rough information about Lü Xichan.</p><p></p><p>Lü Xichan, the chief tactician of the previous generation's Array Hall, Lü Xia.</p><p></p><p>Her life experience seemed ordinary, smooth sailing all the way, taking over her master's role. However, maintaining tranquility and smoothness throughout the power inheritance process was enough to illustrate Lü Xichan's extraordinary qualities.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted slightly, nodding, "No need to fear. Capturing one who is good at arrays is the same as capturing two; there's not much difference."</p><p></p><p>"However, Lü Xichan is, after all, the chief of the Alliance of Immortals' Array Hall. The capture array derived from the 'Unborn Array Crown' you provided may be at risk of being broken. If reinforcements arrive at that time, it will be troublesome."</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully this 'Unborn Array Crown' is reliable."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Fan changed the subject.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just to deceive Moru Bin. The ambush formation laid in the Bamboo Sea at this moment, in terms of complexity, was at least a generation ahead of the Tianxuan Soul-locking and Xuantianguo two major formations.</p><p></p><p>Although Lü Xichan's skill in array formation was among the top of the Array Hall, it was impossible for her to break the formation in a short time.</p><p></p><p>This was evident from the fact that she had already entered the array but was unaware of the dangerous hidden arrays.</p><p></p><p>Saying this was just to cover up the true origin of the ambush formation.</p><p></p><p>Moru Bin did not doubt him, pondering for a moment before saying, "Even if the formation is broken, it will take time. A swift battle is needed, capture her before she finds the flaw in the formation."</p><p></p><p>With that, Moru Bin's body merged with that of a cultivator, and a mirror-like gray line appeared in front of him as if by magic.</p><p></p><p>The dark light shimmered, but in a short time, another cultivator exactly the same appearance emerged.</p><p></p><p>Then the mirror continued to appear, splitting into four, then eight, finally stopping.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the process, there was no trace of energy fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Lin Ling and the others were all dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sensed the eight people in front of him, each one a living cultivator, making it impossible to distinguish between them.</p><p></p><p>"When the battle begins, I will try to assist as much as possible using these bodies."</p><p></p><p>"But it won't be long-lasting..."</p><p></p><p>Moru Bin transmitted.</p><p></p><p>After Xuansushang and Lü Xichan entered the Bamboo Sea, they settled in one of the bamboo houses. In order not to alert the prey, Li Fan and the others did not peep, just ensuring that they were inside, waiting for Shuofeng to arrive.</p><p></p><p>And Shuofeng was considerate enough not to make them wait too long.</p><p></p><p>As crimson snowflakes gently fell in the Bamboo Sea, Shuofeng's figure gradually became clear from the blurred reflection on the lake.</p><p></p><p>Looking towards the nearby bamboo house, Shuofeng's face was filled with dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>But he dared not show it in front of his mother. Taking a deep breath, his expression returned to calm as water.</p><p></p><p>Slowly approaching the bamboo house.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, my son is back. Come in, both you and Aunt Lü are here," the slightly amused voice of Xuansushang came from the bamboo house.</p><p></p><p>The voice didn't sound like that of a mother, but more like a fifteen-sixteen-year-old girl.</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng pushed open the door of the bamboo house and entered.</p><p></p><p>The gazes of Xuansushang and Lü Xichan instantly focused on Shuofeng.</p><p></p><p>Just at that moment...</p><p></p><p>A sharp shout resounded like thunder, echoing in the Bamboo Sea.</p><p></p><p>"Shuoxiong, rest assured, I will definitely help persuade the Court of Instructions to grant you freedom!"</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan spoke, not only Shuofeng, Xuansushang, and Lü Xichan were slightly startled.</p><p></p><p>Even Moru Bin, Lin Ling, and the others were momentarily puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Let's move!" Thankfully, Li Fan's message arrived quickly.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling and the others quickly returned to their positions, and the large array laid down by the four Daoists instantly formed.</p><p></p><p>Moru Bin also did not hold back; the eight identical bodies exploded with a bang.</p><p></p><p>From each body, a shadow-like figure emerged without discernible features.</p><p></p><p>Then, those shadows expanded, quickly enveloping the entire Bamboo Sea.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Xiong'er has grown up..." At the beginning, after a brief pause, Xuansushang maintained her serene smile.</p><p></p><p>She thought Shuofeng had gathered a group of friends and wanted to rebel.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had done such a thing before.</p>

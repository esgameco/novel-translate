        <h1>Chapter 832</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan and his group found a hiding place in a cave at the bottom of a deep valley.</p><p></p><p>There was a formation covering the entrance, and a secret method concealing their presence.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary cultivators, even if they deliberately searched, it would be difficult to discover this entrance.</p><p></p><p>But in front of Li Fan, who possessed the "End Disruption Disc," and Lin Ling, who had eyes and ears throughout the mountains, all the flaws were exposed.</p><p></p><p>However, what surprised Li Fan once again was that there was no one inside the cave!</p><p></p><p>Even though they had just escaped, their presence had not dissipated!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but narrow his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What is this..."</p><p></p><p>"Are they hiding from me?"</p><p></p><p>"Could they predict my arrival in advance?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it prophecy, or..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Fan thought of the incident of the mountain collapse and reappearance.</p><p></p><p>"Time reversal?"</p><p></p><p>At the moment of this speculation, Li Fan's heart couldn't help but beat fiercely.</p><p></p><p>However, he quickly calmed down as he had experienced many such situations before.</p><p></p><p>"It's just speculation, not necessarily true."</p><p></p><p>"After capturing the father and son, we'll have the answers."</p><p></p><p>Driven by long-lost excitement, Li Fan looked towards Lin Ling again.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Ling looked around and shook her head, saying: "They did not come out of this cave."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan carefully looked around again and said, "There are no signs of space teleportation. Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Lin Ling simultaneously looked underground.</p><p></p><p>A hint of a smile appeared on their lips, and Li Fan lazily ordered, "Let's follow them."</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling nodded, enveloping herself in a green light and burrowing into the ground.</p><p></p><p>Normally, underground spaces were dark and difficult to navigate, making it easy to evade pursuers.</p><p></p><p>However, within Li Fan's group, Lin Ling had a relationship with the ancient trees' underground veins!</p><p></p><p>Although the underground space was vast, it was all territory of the ancient trees.</p><p></p><p>Every move couldn't escape her clairvoyance!</p><p></p><p>Guided by Lin Ling, Li Fan and his group quickly found traces of their movements.</p><p></p><p>However, at the same time, Li Fan also noticed that they only walked underground shortly before hastily returning to the surface.</p><p></p><p>"Did they notice that we were following them again?"</p><p></p><p>"They are quite stubborn."</p><p></p><p>With these thoughts in mind, Li Fan returned to the surface once more.</p><p></p><p>This time, Lin Ling sensed that the father and son, Ou Daozi, flew into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the technique of flying would inevitably leave behind spiritual energy fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling quickly found the direction of their escape.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan in tow, they closely followed.</p><p></p><p>No matter how Ou Daozi and his son changed directions or set up traps, they couldn't escape Lin Ling's pursuit.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Ou Daozi and his son seemed to give up struggling and stopped fleeing.</p><p></p><p>Standing silently in the clouds ahead, waiting.</p><p></p><p>"This little Lin Ling is really handy." Finally catching up, Li Fan couldn't help but sigh as he looked at the figures of the father and son in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"What have you been pursuing so persistently for, senior Ou Daozi?" Ou Daozi faced the encirclement of Li Fan and his group with a respectful yet firm salute.</p><p></p><p>"I initially just started construction at home and wanted to ask for your help. I didn't expect to gain such unexpected rewards." Li Fan's eyes narrowed slightly as he scrutinized the two of them.</p><p></p><p>Ou Daozi's son, who was only about eight or nine years old, although not handsome, faced the faint aura emanating from Li Fan with composure and fearlessness. He had his own air.</p><p></p><p>Especially his eyes, glaring at Li Fan viciously, as if harboring some deep-seated hatred.</p><p></p><p>Although they had never met before, their attitudes seemed to confirm Li Fan's suspicions.</p><p></p><p>Ou Daozi also noticed his son's unusual behavior and his expression changed. He stood in front of his son, saying, "I don't understand what you mean!"</p><p></p><p>"What is his ability? Could it be the legendary technique of time reversal?" Although Li Fan appeared to be just a Golden Core cultivator, Lin Ling and Tian Yang, both of Dao Fusion and Nascent Soul, respected him.</p><p></p><p>Ou Daozi couldn't discern Li Fan's true cultivation level and responded, "Senior, please don't joke. How could there be such a thing as time flowing in reverse in this world?"</p><p></p><p>"As for my son's abilities..."</p><p></p><p>Ou Daozi spoke, lowering his voice intentionally, but suddenly fell silent as if waiting for something!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mind immediately sounded alarm bells: "Binding Insects!"</p><p></p><p>The target was not Ou Daozi but his son!</p><p></p><p>The child instantly lost control, but there was no panic in his eyes. Everything seemed to be within his expectations as he looked at Li Fan with a hint of mockery.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Tian Yang's body suddenly expanded, forming a black and red spherical barrier, trapping Li Fan at the center.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A massive rumble echoed, indicating a collision with something.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly felt dizzy, and cracks appeared on Tian Yang's puppet body.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Lin Ling acted quickly to save him, preventing his body from being torn apart.</p><p></p><p>"What on earth is this!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan cursed inwardly, glancing at the protective energy barrier, which hadn't decreased.</p><p></p><p>His heart quickly stabilized.</p><p></p><p>The blue light of alchemy flickered in his mind, playing back the recorded images countless times to discern the cause of the recent incident.</p><p></p><p>And everything that happened in a split second.</p><p></p><p>The attacker, who struck too quickly for Lin Ling and Tian Yang to react, turned out to be an arrow intentionally left to lure Li Fan's group to its position.</p><p></p><p>While buying time, at the moment the arrow hit Li Fan, a burst of yellow light emitted from Ou Daozi's son.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly ignoring the arrow's speed, he precisely targeted and locked onto it.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, although the arrow didn't change direction, it strangely flew back towards its original position!</p><p></p><p>Enveloping Ou Daozi and his son in yellow light, with the unimaginable speed of the arrow, they instantly broke free from Li Fan's group encirclement!</p><p></p><p>"Master, they are gone. They have run too far for us to sense their presence." Lin Ling said with some self-blame.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang also shook his head, feeling somewhat guilty.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan waved his hand dismissively, not concerned.</p><p></p><p>Reflecting on the recent events once again, Li Fan vaguely understood what kind of ability the other party possessed.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't time reversal as imagined...</p><p></p><p>Or maybe it had some connection.</p><p></p><p>Reverse the state of the object to a certain time in the past!</p><p></p><p>Falling on a seven or eight-year-old child, Li Fan was pleasantly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Because since his reincarnation, he had only encountered one cultivator who had a connection to the way of time.</p><p></p><p>"Can they run away?"</p><p></p><p>"Evading now doesn't mean they can escape forever!"</p><p></p><p>"Once I've got my eye on them, there's no possibility of escape!"</p>

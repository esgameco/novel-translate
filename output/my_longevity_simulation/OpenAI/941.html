        <h1>Chapter 941</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In an instant, Li Fan had the idea of going to Wanxian Island to plunder.</p><p></p><p>But he quickly suppressed it forcibly.</p><p></p><p>Although it seemed that Wanxian Island was just a remote town in the sea of clouds, the highest cultivation realm there was only at the Nascent Soul stage. Li Fan could easily suppress them now.</p><p></p><p>But besides burying the remains of the first-generation law propagators, Wanxian Island also suppressed the “Through the Nether Passage” below, which was suspected to be the mysterious source of the Xuanyellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>The person in the Tianji Hall responsible for supervising the anomalies, Gongsun Qixuan, was definitely not as simple as he appeared on the surface.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of excavating under the eyes of the Wanxian League...</p><p></p><p>"It's actually feasible. As long as I muddy the waters again."</p><p></p><p>"There's something strange too. If they wanted the remains, they could just dig on Wanxian Island. Why did they have to take that batch taken by the Five Elders Guild?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had some doubts in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to quickly make contact with Moru Bin."</p><p></p><p>The scene shifts back to the Five Elders Guild, to Li Qing here.</p><p></p><p>"The remains? Did the Wanxian League go all out just for those?" Li Qing asked the same question as the main body.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Qing Yang affirmed again.</p><p></p><p>"In the Soul-stamp, there are fifty-six remnants and a hundred and three remains."</p><p></p><p>"But after so many years of torment, they have become completely mad and should have no value anymore." Qing Yang glanced at Li Qing intentionally or unintentionally.</p><p></p><p>There was no change in Li Qing's expression. After pretending to think for a moment, he said, "Since you all are so willing, I will be straightforward about some matters too."</p><p></p><p>"All thirty-three immortal selectors are dead. The Wanxian League should not be able to summon a Divine Figure in the short term."</p><p></p><p>"And, the previous immortal selectors were selected layer by layer through the grand Immortal League examination of great momentum. If they want to replenish the immortal selectors, it may require a period of vacuum. This might be your chance for a counterattack." Li Qing did not spell it out, just subtly provoking.</p><p></p><p>Although Qing Yang appeared calm, the change in her eyes exposed the turmoil in her heart at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder, when will the Five Divine Figures fully regain their strength?" Li Qing took the opportunity to inquire.</p><p></p><p>Qing Yang shook her head and remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that I thought I could continue my fate with the 'One-Minded Divine Figure'." Li Qing sighed.</p><p></p><p>Qing Yang's gaze suddenly froze and fell on Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the substantial killing intent, Li Qing clasped his hands. "My mission is completed, so I won't disturb you further."</p><p></p><p>"I hope we have the opportunity to cooperate in the future."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing prepared to leave, and Qing Yang did not stop him either.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, they exchanged a new way to communicate. Li Qing turned into a streak of sword light and flew away straight.</p><p></p><p>"Mr., this person is suspicious. Should we just let him go like this?" A shadow suddenly emerged behind Qing Yang and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Although this person is strong, I am sure I can keep him here." Qing Yang's gaze fixed on the sky. Until the streak of sword light completely disappeared, she said calmly, "He is not our enemy for now, so there is no need to worry about him."</p><p></p><p>"How is the Poison Seed Plan progressing?"</p><p></p><p>"We still can't contact them. The Wanxian League has taken our residents somewhere."</p><p></p><p>"Continue tracking." A touch of coldness flashed in Qing Yang's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"If they dare to reach out, they must be prepared to be extinguished."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" The shadow's tone revealed a hint of excitement.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Qing was unaware of what happened after he left.</p><p></p><p>However, he could vaguely feel the seemingly subtle malice circling around him, which belonged to the shadow.</p><p></p><p>Thus, he did not linger. After getting the desired results, he left the territory of the Five Elders Guild.</p><p></p><p>However, on his way back, he did catch a sight that left him quite shocked.</p><p></p><p>On the large ruins almost leveled by the Wanxian League, a group of cultivators in flowing armor appeared.</p><p></p><p>Floating in midair, projections of buildings were cast from the heads of their armors to the ground.</p><p></p><p>As the beams of light solidified, the originally illusory buildings gradually turned real.</p><p></p><p>With almost no effort, a team of cultivators created a sizable city out of thin air in just half an incense stick's time.</p><p></p><p>"Mission accomplished, let me see the rewards this time."</p><p></p><p>"This is too stingy... oh well, let's move on to the next place."</p><p></p><p>These cultivators muttered as they flew away one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting," Li Qing squinted his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators from the Land of Carefree seemed to have a completely different attitude and behavior compared to external cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"If buildings can be rebuilt, what about the people taken by the Wanxian League?"</p><p></p><p>"Could they be conjured out of nowhere too?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing became interested and, with the approval of the main body, quietly lurked near the newly built city.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing didn't have to wait long.</p><p></p><p>Six days later, another group of armored cultivators appeared.</p><p></p><p>They escorted a massive warship and arrived above the city.</p><p></p><p>As a huge beam of light projected down from the warship, it enveloped the city.</p><p></p><p>One by one, seemingly sleeping bodies descended from the light beam and slowly floated to various places in the city.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the once empty city regained its liveliness.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing sneaked into the city, controlled a resident, and carefully investigated.</p><p></p><p>He found that they were indeed real people, not illusory creations.</p><p></p><p>"This method..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's expression turned serious.</p><p></p><p>In this war, it seemed that the Five Elders Guild appeared to have lost, but also not. With some expectations for what would come next, Li Qing transformed into a streak of sword light and left the place.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Wanxian League, Guangyang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The Saint Embryo Li Fan was playing chess under a willow tree with a sloppy-dressed old man.</p><p></p><p>The Saint Embryo was very relaxed, while the old man would ponder over each move for a long time.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how the old man struggled, he still lost in the end.</p><p></p><p>"I give up!"</p><p></p><p>"You are a rotten guy!"</p><p></p><p>The old man snorted and flipped the chessboard directly.</p><p></p><p>Oddly enough, the black and white chess pieces that should have been scattered all over seemed to be attracted back to the chessboard, rearranging themselves and returning to the old man's side.</p><p></p><p>The chessboard righted itself and landed in front of the old man again.</p><p></p><p>"What the heck..."</p><p></p><p>The old man couldn't help but curse under his breath.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, on the other hand, was already accustomed to such occurrences.</p>

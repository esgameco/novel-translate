        <h1>Chapter 887</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The whole process was full of surprises but no dangers.</p><p></p><p>"Thank goodness I have this treasure, the Seven-Colored Jade with Illusory Light, it's like a container sealing the gray mold. Otherwise, ordinary means would have a hard time controlling it."</p><p></p><p>"If this gray mold were to escape, it would probably bring about a catastrophic disaster."</p><p></p><p>Despite holding such a terrifying object, Li Fan's face showed no fear.</p><p></p><p>Observing the different reactions of the gray mold inside the three clusters of light.</p><p></p><p>The largest one, after seeing the consequences of the tempted mold, became silent again.</p><p></p><p>Quietly lurking inside the skull, just like Li Fan saw it before.</p><p></p><p>The second cluster of light still seemed unwilling to be sealed. It continued to fiercely corrode towards the surrounding Seven-Colored Divine Light.</p><p></p><p>But with Li Fan continuously supplying the power from the Dongtian, its efforts were in vain.</p><p></p><p>The cluster in the third light had the least amount of gray mold. And perhaps because it had recently split off, it seemed the calmest. Its external color was also not as deep gray as its predecessors.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>As a result, Li Fan was able to see the true appearance of the gray mold.</p><p></p><p>Composed of many horizontal and vertical lines, like...</p><p></p><p>Some kind of text.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but squint his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, he suddenly thought of that huge character on the fairyland ground. (Link to a mysterious website)</p><p></p><p>The hidden content in this gray mold seemed to have many similarities to it!</p><p></p><p>Although the scales of the two were vastly different, when Li Fan viewed it from a calligraphy perspective and compared them, he discovered that a part of the "brushstrokes" almost overlapped completely!</p><p></p><p>Since he had not witnessed the full character, Li Fan couldn't be sure which character was creating this terrifying gray blot.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan could be certain that this character, like "Hunger" and "Chaos," was also one of the sources of chaos in various realms.</p><p></p><p>"Among the three, there are differences."</p><p></p><p>"I haven't seen a real Chaos character, I've only seen copies reproduced by mysterious people."</p><p></p><p>"The complete Hunger character led to the formation of the fairyland. Countless immortal realms and countless cultivation worlds were affected."</p><p></p><p>"And this new character, lacking a complete physical form, turned into numerous gray mold spots, encroaching on various worlds."</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's mind, various characters flashed rapidly.</p><p></p><p>He tried to find a corresponding disaster related to the calamity brought by the gray mold.</p><p></p><p>But none matched.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, what I see is only superficial."</p><p></p><p>"They are just the external manifestations created by the characters of True Immortals."</p><p></p><p>"Like what I saw before, the attraction of the Xuanhuang realm to the fairyland..."</p><p></p><p>"The attraction is just an external performance. The real core can only be understood by personally seeing the characters of True Immortals. (Link to a mysterious website) is a character of 'Hunger'..."</p><p></p><p>"What is the essence of the gray mold?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan watched the three clusters of light in front of him silently, falling into deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, he woke up from his contemplation.</p><p></p><p>It was apparent that merely guessing would not allow Li Fan to comprehend the mysteries with his intellect.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps cultivating more gray mold and observing their proliferation process might reveal something."</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan temporarily suppressed this idea.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Seven-Colored Divine Light naturally sealed the gray mold, it didn't mean that the level of the Seven-Colored Jade with Illusory Light was higher than the gray mold.</p><p></p><p>After all, all Li Fan could do was seal the gray mold.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the gray mold wouldn't disappear or weaken on its own, while the Seven-Colored Divine Light would continue to be eroded.</p><p></p><p>In reality, it was only delaying the outbreak of the gray mold using the power of the source of the laws of one realm.</p><p></p><p>"Just like the Xuanhuang realm, which has been maintained under the attraction of the fairyland for nearly ten thousand years, it's the same principle."</p><p></p><p>"Even though I have the Five Elements Dongtian, the Seven-Colored Divine Light is hardly at risk of being fully depleted."</p><p></p><p>"But just to be safe, three sealed clusters of light are enough."</p><p></p><p>"After all, my goal has been achieved."</p><p></p><p>He repressed these clusters of light once again into the deepest part of his Dongtian, firmly suppressing them.</p><p></p><p>"With this in hand, even if the Longevity Powerhouses come, they will fall into my calculations."</p><p></p><p>Worst-case scenario, there would be a revival after the destruction of the Xuanhuang realm!</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan wouldn't easily use this final killer move.</p><p></p><p>Now that his strength had greatly improved, and his mental weaknesses had been filled, even facing the Longevity Heavenly Venerable, he could last a few rounds.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with the protection of the Seven-Colored Divine Light, he shouldn't encounter the situation where he couldn't even use the move like before.</p><p></p><p>He wouldn't be killed instantly; he could timely use the move.</p><p></p><p>Under these two premises, accumulating more experience in dealing with Longevity Realm opponents was also a good plan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had already begun to plan for the most suitable candidate.</p><p></p><p>"Let's start with the Ancient Method Longevity first."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Ancient Method Longevity that could survive until now could be considered ultimate old monsters.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Li Fan couldn't find any soft targets.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was contemplative in the Spiritual Wood realm.</p><p></p><p>Outside, the manifestation of the Transmission Law Heavenly Venerable Law Form, jointly displayed by the Thirty-Three Immortal Selects, made another move!</p><p></p><p>This time, the Heavenly Venerable Law Form appeared in a surprising location within the Five Elders Association's territory!</p><p></p><p>Adjacent to the Jiushan Prefecture!</p><p></p><p>Different from the performance of conquering and suppressing everything in Jiushan Prefecture, this time when the Heavenly Venerable Law Form emerged in the sky and opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>The endless beings in Yongliang Prefecture indeed felt a crisis approaching.</p><p></p><p>But at this critical moment, the illusion of a scholar stood in front of the Heavenly Venerable Law Form.</p><p></p><p>He tilted his head slightly, lips slightly open, as if saying something.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, the practitioners in Yongliang Prefecture discovered that the Transmission Law Heavenly Venerable Law Form in the sky was slowly closing its eyes again!</p><p></p><p>Boom...</p><p></p><p>In a slight tremor, the illusion of the Transmission Law Heavenly Venerable dissolved into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>A catastrophic disaster was thus resolved.</p><p></p><p>The figure of the scholar also slowly disappeared, and numerous practitioners bowed to express their gratitude towards the Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that wanting to resist Longevity Realm cultivators in the area shrouded by the Longevity Heavenly Venerable goes against the natural order."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals has never been able to gain any substantial advantage from the Five Elders Association all these years."</p><p></p><p>"It's simply because the power of the Heavenly Venerable is too strong."</p><p></p><p>"Instead of fighting the cultivators, it's more like fighting against the five Longevity Powerhouses."</p><p></p><p>"There's no chance of winning."</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan received the image sent by the Five Elders Association, he thought so.</p><p></p><p>However, he furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals always acted wisely and then moved, not doing things that were meaningless.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't possibly be unaware that the Transmission Law Heavenly Venerable Law Form within the territory of the Five Elders Association was of little concern.</p><p></p><p>But they still did it.</p><p></p><p>"Could they be experimenting with something?"</p>

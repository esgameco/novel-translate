        <h1>Chapter 927</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>As Li Qing walked, he observed his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, are you having fun in the illusion world?"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a voice suddenly caught his attention.</p><p></p><p>Looking over, Li Qing saw a shabby old man lying on the ground, seemingly abandoned by the world.</p><p></p><p>Uncertain of the man's intentions, Li Qing cautiously chose not to respond.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, no need to be so nervous. Being too restrained is not good!"</p><p></p><p>"Just act in the illusion world the way you want! We lack someone like you among us!"</p><p></p><p>The old man praised Li Qing generously.</p><p></p><p>However, as the old man spoke, Li Qing faintly sensed that unfriendly gazes were constantly fixated on him.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, let me tell you a little secret."</p><p></p><p>"In order to have fun, not only are your original memories sealed in the illusion world, even mine is too."</p><p></p><p>"Only when the illusion is about to shatter, the consciousness of our true selves will awaken."</p><p></p><p>"At that moment, memories of everyone in the illusion world will suddenly burst forth together!"</p><p></p><p>A hint of intoxication appeared on the old man's face, as if he had just tasted a vintage wine!</p><p></p><p>"Two hundred thirty-six thousand eight hundred times…"</p><p></p><p>"Two hundred thirty-six thousand eight hundred times!"</p><p></p><p>The old man repeated this number.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk tsk…"</p><p></p><p>"The joy you experience doesn't even compare to one-thousandth of mine!"</p><p></p><p>The old man shook his head. **(Note: the URL provided in the text has been removed for security reasons.)**</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the number "two hundred thirty-six thousand eight hundred," Li Qing was briefly stunned before not fully grasping its significance.</p><p></p><p>However, he quickly understood, and his expression became somewhat strange.</p><p></p><p>When he looked back, the shabby old man had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"This body seems to have belonged to a senior elder of the Great Dao Sect many years ago."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing pondered over the memories in the illusion.</p><p></p><p>Continuing towards the top of the sect's main hall, Li Qing still heard many arguments along the way.</p><p></p><p>"Why did you castrate him? Isn't a normal start better?"</p><p></p><p>"Why the opposition now? Weren't you in favor in the beginning?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't see any problem with a little punishment. The key issue is, why give him the 'Reverse Morality Scripture'?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a newly researched technique, worth trying out for its effects. Who would've thought this kid was so adept at it? Tsk tsk…"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I think it was intentional on your part."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, we can't use the 'Reverse Morality Scripture' again."</p><p></p><p>"No, such a good thing, how can we just ban it like that?"</p><p></p><p>"I object!"</p><p></p><p>"I object too!"</p><p></p><p>…</p><p></p><p>Though no one was in sight, the voices reverberated around Li Qing as if ghosts, constantly whispering in his ears.</p><p></p><p>As if countless figures were staring at Li Qing, murmuring secretly.</p><p></p><p>Though Li Qing remained composed on the surface, he started to feel a growing chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>These voices interweaved, much like countless thoughts in his mind.</p><p></p><p>His mind became divided into numerous fragments.</p><p></p><p>As Li Qing approached the sect's main hall, the discordant voices became more and more prevalent.</p><p></p><p>The content of the discussions grew increasingly frantic.</p><p></p><p>They became akin to the ravings of demons, piercing into Li Qing's mind like needles.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Qing halted his steps.</p><p></p><p>He noticed a slight dampness on his face and gently touched it, only to find fresh blood flowing from his nostrils and eyes.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings seemed to have become somewhat hazy at some point.</p><p></p><p>But the demonic voices in his ears not only didn't cease but intensified.</p><p></p><p>"Cough…"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing coughed abruptly, even spitting out fragments of his internal organs.</p><p></p><p>After taking a few more steps, this body ultimately couldn't hold up.</p><p></p><p>Under the vibration of the myriad cacophonous voices, it turned into a puddle of mud.</p><p></p><p>However, as the blood and flesh undulated in the void, a new body was beginning to take shape again.</p><p></p><p>But the omnipresent demonic voices seemed to have no intention of sparing Li Qing at all.</p><p></p><p>Before the body could fully manifest, it was crushed again.</p><p></p><p>Thus, on this long staircase, a bizarre scene unfolded.</p><p></p><p>A lump of shapeless decomposing flesh struggled and rolled upwards laboriously.</p><p></p><p>After each reappearance following being crushed, the total amount of fleshy substance seemed to decrease.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Qing never gave up, in the end, only a small, deformed cluster of flesh remained, struggling and rolling clumsily.</p><p></p><p>Even in such a wretched state, the surrounding voices showed no sign of abating.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, they grew more excited. The voices turned sharper, no longer resembling human sounds but rather all sorts of meaningless noise from the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Just as the last remnant of Li Qing's flesh was about to disappear completely, a black sword shadow suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Issuing a faint sword hum.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it momentarily suppressed the chaotic cacophony of demon voices around!</p><p></p><p>Seizing this fleeting moment, the black sword shadow burst forth with immense speed. It transformed into a virtual line, piercing directly into the grand hall of the sect.</p><p></p><p>Although the doors of the hall were open, the interior appeared pitch-black from the outside.</p><p></p><p>Like an abyss where nothing could be seen.</p><p></p><p>After that moment of silence, countless voices erupted suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Like thunderous roars, cries of ghosts, and howls of wolves!</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, interesting, interesting!"</p><p></p><p>"Why did you purposely let him go, why? Why didn't I get to crush him inch by inch into minced meat!"</p><p></p><p>"Stop pretending. Is deceiving yourself fun?"</p><p></p><p>…</p><p></p><p>Contrary to the chaos and horror outside the hall, the Great Dao Sect's main hall was unusually quiet.</p><p></p><p>In the vast hall, aside from the highest seat of the sect master, there was nothing else.</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Zhao sat quietly in the seat.</p><p></p><p>Sitting upright like a child, hands placed on her thighs.</p><p></p><p>Her expression frozen, unmoving.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing sneakily glanced at Senior Sister Zhao.</p><p></p><p>Her appearance seemed frozen in her teenage years.</p><p></p><p>Identical to the one seen in the illusion.</p><p></p><p>"I have met the One-Minded Celestial Master."</p><p></p><p>Although the atmosphere in the hall felt strange, Li Qing respectfully bowed and saluted.</p><p></p><p>"What brings you here?"</p><p></p><p>The melodious voice of Senior Sister Zhao rang out.</p><p></p><p>Not from the body in the seat but seemingly from all directions within the sect's main hall.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing didn't hold back and directly said, "I have come for the lost techniques of the Ancient Heaven Sect."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Heaven and Earth Tribute,' 'Eternal Martial Art,' 'Soul-Cleaving Divine Technique,' 'Heavenly Grief, Earthly Desolation Scripture'…"</p><p></p><p>"These scriptures were originally possessions of our Ancient Heaven Sect. Today, they should return to their rightful owner."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing spoke earnestly.</p><p></p><p>There was a moment of silence in the hall.</p><p></p><p>Then, Senior Sister Zhao chuckled as if she had heard an extremely amusing joke, laughing softly.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't all the Ancient Heaven Sect people dead yet?"</p><p></p><p>"How do you know that I once acquired these techniques?"</p><p></p><p></p>

        <h1>Chapter 740</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Nan Gong Shirong's tone was somewhat sighing.</p><p></p><p>"Since the master has once entered the Immeasurable Wall and broken through it, then it should be an easy task to rescue Guan Changge," one of the accompanying cultivators named Yan Yiqiu quickly praised.</p><p></p><p>Nan Gong Shirong's face darkened, "I dare not guarantee anything. Whether it succeeds or not will depend on the kid's luck."</p><p></p><p>Flattering went too far, and Yan Yiqiu's face turned bitter, quickly lowering his head.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Xu Bai interjected, "Sir, what are the wonders of the Immeasurable Wall?"</p><p></p><p>Nan Gong Shirong looked at Xu Bai, who looked curious, pondered for a moment, and then explained, "I cannot be certain, only guessing based on my experience. The Immeasurable Wall may be a natural place of enlightenment. When images appear on it, there's a chance that nearby cultivators will be drawn into it."</p><p></p><p>"And inside the Immeasurable Wall..." ***</p><p></p><p>Nan Gong Shirong narrowed his eyes, "It's like activating the 'Enlightenment' function on the Celestial Mirror. No, it's even more effective than 'Enlightenment'. With a single thought, numerous insights come rushing in. The joy of gaining without effort, I still remember it now."</p><p></p><p>"But there is a downside. This enhanced ability to perceive seems to be focused on the deepest 'art' in your mind. I was obsessed with trying to comprehend..."</p><p></p><p>Nan Gong Shirong paused, skipped talking about his own learnings, and continued, "I was already at the brink. Under the multiple times amplification of enlightenment, it didn't take me long to have a sudden realization. So, I naturally broke through the wall."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai glanced at the Immeasurable Wall and, recalling the clues he had gathered earlier, pondered, "It is said that Guan Changge greatly admired Guan Xingxiu and held great respect for the senior's swordsmanship. However, he himself lacked the talent for sword cultivation..."</p><p></p><p>"Even with the enlightenment from the Immeasurable Wall, without a decade or more, it would be difficult for him to make progress. Is this the truth behind his disappearance?"</p><p></p><p>"And the scenes witnessed by the cultivators accompanying Guan Changge on the Immeasurable Wall were of swordsmanship, which is consistent with your speculation, sir..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai voiced out his deductions with a breath, attributing them only to Nan Gong Shirong's speculation.</p><p></p><p>Nan Gong Shirong neither affirmed nor denied, instead after a while, he added, "Inside and outside the Immeasurable Wall, time flow may not be the same. Moreover, if one stays inside for too long, even if one successfully comprehends, it may be impossible to come back out."</p><p></p><p>"So, to save Gu Changge, we need to act quickly."</p><p></p><p>Yan Yiqiu spoke up at this point, "Sir, how do we enter the Immeasurable Wall then?"</p><p></p><p>Nan Gong Shirong turned his head, his face becoming somewhat unpleasant, "Are you asking me?"</p><p></p><p>"I dare not!" Yan Yiqiu hurriedly explained.</p><p></p><p>Nan Gong Shirong coldly snorted, "If I knew how, why would I have brought you all here?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Yiqiu was secretly distressed, wanting to give himself a few slaps.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, before Nan Gong Shirong finished his words, Xu Bai flew back to the Immeasurable Wall.</p><p></p><p>Thinking to himself, "Since it is not something strange but a natural place of enlightenment, with the affinity degree of this body to the Heavenly Dao, there should be some perception."</p><p></p><p>After observing for a long time and finding nothing unusual like before, Xu Bai extended his hands and touched the wall.</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes, motionless.</p><p></p><p>Upon Nan Gong Shirong's signal, Yan Yiqiu and three others followed Xu Bai's action, exploring the Immeasurable Wall directly with their hands.</p><p></p><p>At the luminous mirror, it seemed as if four stone statues suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Persistently feeling, the once rigid wall in front of Xu Bai seemed to gradually soften.</p><p></p><p>His body also softened, slowly merging into the wall.</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Xu Bai did not resist.</p><p></p><p>Instead, allowing the Immeasurable Wall to engulf his body.</p><p></p><p>Thus, amidst the exclamations of Yan Yiqiu and the others, Xu Bai vanished in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Nan Gong Shirong stared at the spot where Xu Bai disappeared, his eyes flashing with an inexplicable expression.</p><p></p><p>Having learned the mystery of the Immeasurable Wall from Nan Gong Shirong beforehand, **</p><p></p><p>So, the moment he entered it, Xu Bai's thoughts were on "how to move this Immeasurable Wall."</p><p></p><p>Initially, he didn't have practical expectations for this, so when numerous thoughts spontaneously emerged in his mind, Xu Bai was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>However, he had clearly wasted this enlightenment opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Because according to the Immeasurable Wall itself, trying to move it without affecting its enlightenment function...</p><p></p><p>Simply couldn't be done.</p><p></p><p>The birth of the Immeasurable Wall was a rare event. Even the heavens and earth themselves could not easily replicate it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai felt a little regretful but quickly resumed a normal mindset.</p><p></p><p>Having completed the enlightenment, Xu Bai was not expelled from the Immeasurable Wall. So, he began searching for Guan Changge within it.</p><p></p><p>The scenes here were somewhat similar to those inside the 'Root of Heaven.' The bodies of the cultivators existed in abstract, twisted lines. However, in the 'Root of Heaven,' the lines were more orderly and singular, while here they were draped in colorful hues, swaying like seaweed floating in water.</p><p></p><p>Sensing keenly, Xu Bai noticed that with time passing, the lines forming the bodies were slowly dissolving, merging with the Immeasurable Wall.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, the blurry and lifeless figures seen around seemed to be cultivators who had mistakenly entered the Immeasurable Wall and failed to leave, leaving behind traces after blending with this space.</p><p></p><p>Swiftly traversing the Immeasurable Wall, guided by intermittent fluctuations, Xu Bai soon found Guan Changge.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his body had dissolved to the size of a seven or eight-year-old child, yet he seemed completely unaware. Clumsily swinging a few sparse lines representing a 'sword' in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Guan Changge!" Xu Bai tried to speak, trying to awaken him.</p><p></p><p>However, within the space of the Immeasurable Wall, there was simply no 'sound.' It seemed that some lines flowed from Xu Bai's body and disappeared into the surroundings without catching Guan Changge's attention.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai then flew directly to Guan Changge, snatched the 'sword' from his hand.</p><p></p><p>Without further ado, he was about to take him away with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>But in the critical moment, Xu Bai's grip on Guan Changge's part detached from his body to his surprise.</p><p></p><p>Looking somewhat astonished at Guan Changge, he saw Guan Changge meet his gaze and slightly shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Shrinking further in size, he once again evolved a sword. He looked obsessed, wielded it firmly.</p><p></p><p>"To hear of the Dao in the morning and die in the evening," Xu Bai was slightly moved.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, no longer insisting, he took a portion of Guan Changge and broke through the wall.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

            <p>Liu San smiled bitterly and said, "Young Master, you don't know where you heard such fantastic ideas from. Xin69shuba â†’ 69shux.com."</p><p></p><p>"The difficulty in this is truly not small. Those little guys can all be considered natural talents."</p><p></p><p>"During this period, they have all advanced to the stage of perfect Qi cultivation. However, they are firmly stuck by this Foundation Building technique."</p><p></p><p>Liu San shook his head, "In my opinion, it is very difficult for them to succeed in building foundations with me."</p><p></p><p>"At first, it was to deceive the Tianxuan treasure mirror that I had to come up with this method. Now that they are planning to submit to the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, should we continue? How about..." Liu San tentatively asked.</p><p></p><p>"One must not be without vigilance. Although joining the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance may not pose immediate danger, we cannot rule out the possibility of future confrontations." Xu Bai stroked his chin, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Having a life-saving card is always good. Let's continue with this plan," Xu Bai said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>A trace of surprise flashed in Liu San's eyes, and he subconsciously nodded.</p><p></p><p>"The master has considered everything carefully," Fang Zaiji echoed repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Bai turned to Jiang Yushan, "I heard that Elder Jiang is still troubled by the defeat against a female cultivator from the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan furrowed her brows and nodded, "The new Combined Dao method steals the power of heaven and earth. When in battle, it indeed surpasses the old Combined Dao method. But I have already figured out a way to deal with it. In the next fight, she will have a hard time."</p><p></p><p>A hint of coldness flickered in Jiang Yushan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai did not inquire further, reaching into his storage ring to take out a bluish fruit that seemed to be between reality and illusion.</p><p></p><p>"This item contains the secrets of heaven and earth and is an invaluable treasure of this era. It might be of help to Elder Jiang."</p><p></p><p>No further explanations were needed.</p><p></p><p>The moment the real Induction Fruit appeared, the three Combined Dao practitioners present were instantly drawn to the aura it contained.</p><p></p><p>Although they were not clear about the true use of the fruit, the subtle fluctuations of Dao principles emanating from it were enough to indicate its extraordinary nature.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji was almost drooling, muttering continuously, "Master, you are biased. Such a good thing is only given to Yushan."</p><p></p><p>"Don't you have any more? Give me one to try," he persisted.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai chuckled, "You think it's fruit on a tree that I can easily pluck more of. I've been saving this item for a long time and only barely acquired it. If not for Elder Jiang's continuous concern over this matter, I wouldn't have easily taken it out. Honestly, I feel a bit reluctant."</p><p></p><p>As Xu Bai laughed, Jiang Yushan moved to return the real Induction Fruit.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Bai politely refused, "Once something is given away, there's no taking it back. Elder Jiang, keep it. After all, the stronger you are, the safer our Medicine King Sect will be."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan nodded upon hearing this and accepted the fruit before bidding farewell to continue her cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Yushan..." Liu San watched her leaving figure, wanting to say something but hesitating.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan, however, did not look back or respond.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Xu Bai turned to Fang Zaiji, "Since the research on the End-Terminal Disk has yielded no results, why not strengthen the Medicine King True Cauldron while we have the chance?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji's face fell.</p><p></p><p>"If I am satisfied, I will go buy a Big Dao Fruit," Xu Bai added nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>The Big Dao Fruit was the name Xu Bai made up for the Real Induction Fruit.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji's eyes lit up, "Master, rest assured, leave it to me. When you instructed me earlier about reinforcing the Medicine King True Cauldron, I already had a plan in mind. Due to time and material constraints, I haven't been able to start..."</p><p></p><p>"In this case, Elder Fang, you can rest assured. If you need any materials, just let me know," Xu Bai said as the Medicine King True Cauldron rotated on his palm.</p><p></p><p>"After all, our disciples of Medicine King Sect are still within it. We must consider their safety," Xu Bai hinted.</p><p></p><p>Liu San's gaze lingered on the Medicine King True Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>Only when Xu Bai and Fang Zaiji headed to the Refining Room did Liu San reluctantly withdraw his gaze.</p><p></p><p>A mysterious expression lingered on his face, leaving others unsure of what he was thinking.</p><p></p><p>---------------</p><p></p><p>Tianquan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>After a long period of data processing, Li Fan had fully analyzed the entire content of the Wuji Yingxu Method.</p><p></p><p>After trying to use his supernatural powers, Li Fan pondered whether these could eliminate Mr. Bai's influence on him.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, perhaps due to the limits of his powers or because he had already been tainted and irreversibly influenced by Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan uttered the "True Return," various emotions of reluctance once again swept over him.</p><p></p><p>As if bursting out at the same time, he quickly closed the True Return interface.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I was thinking too much."</p><p></p><p>Having failed multiple times, Li Fan was not discouraged.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he set it aside for the time being.</p><p></p><p>He took out the Separation Disc.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Separation Disc seemed even more translucent than before.</p><p></p><p>"Nine discs vie for supremacy, now only two are left."</p><p></p><p>"Now it's just me and another unknown rival."</p><p></p><p>Playing with the glossy Separation Disc, Li Fan pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>In his previous spare time, he had infused all the formation data he knew, excluding the Reverse Life and Death Array and the Tianxuan Soul Locking Array, into it.</p><p></p><p>And he felt that the Separation Disc in his hand was much stronger than the other remaining one.</p><p></p><p>Even if he stopped feeding it with formation data for it to evolve naturally, it would still ultimately emerge victorious.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the other side has accepted defeat and given up struggling."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I'm running out of time."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>He chose not to feed the last formation data into it.</p><p></p><p>"If the Tianxuan Second Life is still within the sensing range of the Tianxuan Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"That will be my final killer move."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder, after upgrading, in comparison to the resurrected Mr. Bai, which is stronger, the Tianxuan Mirror or him?"</p><p></p><p>A glint of coldness flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to seek life from death, so naturally he had to create chaos.</p><p></p><p>Just like when the Red Flame burned the sea and the Ink Demon landed, in order to prevent people from using their doppelgangers to deduce their true selves and completely confirm the death of the doppelganger.</p><p></p><p>The more chaos, the better!</p><p></p><p>There are too many hidden entities in the Xuanghuang Realm; only by making them fight each other can their vision be slightly obscured.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, there is another way to get rid of Mr. Bai's influence."</p><p></p><p>"That is by directly eliminating the cause of 'attachment.'"</p><p></p><p>"For example, for the Separation Disk that is completely greedy in the heart, unlock its complete form."</p><p></p><p>"For example, for the End-Terminal Disc that can completely shield the Tianxuan Treasure Mirror, quickly research the possible outcomes."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately..."</p><p></p><p>"It is only theoretically possible."</p>

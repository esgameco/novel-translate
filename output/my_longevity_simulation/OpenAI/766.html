        <h1>Chapter 766</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Prevent the possible peeping of the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>And on the towering tree in front of him, Li Fan saw many completely different but seemingly of the same origin scenes.</p><p></p><p>All derived from the derivation of the "Inverted Five Elements Life-Death Sword," resulting in possible outcomes.</p><p></p><p>There is a strengthening of the "death" attribute, pushing the power of killing to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>There is a greater emphasis on the "life" attribute, not only able to heal wounds in an instant, but also create creatures out of nothingness, and create living beings.</p><p></p><p>And some focus the derivation of divine skills back to the "power of the Five Elements." The fusion of the Five Elements, or the mutual generation and restraint of the Five Elements, produces countless possibilities.</p><p></p><p>The suddenly appearing divine skill data was so vast.</p><p></p><p>Even with Li Fan's current mental strength, when he wanted to have a look at the "Divine Skill Tree," he felt a slight stagnation.</p><p></p><p>Every specific divine skill that his thoughts reached would have a corresponding specific feedback emerging in his mind.</p><p></p><p>After having a general understanding of the whole, Li Fan then looked at the countdown constantly jumping in his field of vision.</p><p></p><p>Only less than five hours left, Li Fan pondered for a moment and quickly made a decision.</p><p></p><p>It is one of the possible branches after the fusion of the Five Elements, and its essence can be summed up in sixteen characters: "The Five Elements return to one, the boundless is full; its power is endless, and the spirit is immortal. Read new Chapter 69 Book 28 at shux.com."</p><p></p><p>Yes, the divine skill Li Fan wanted was a marvelous secret method that could protect the soul!</p><p></p><p>The power of the mutual generation of the Five Elements can greatly enhance the circulation and recovery ability of a cultivator's physical body. It is almost possible to achieve a state where the spiritual energy is self-sustaining even without external help. General injuries to the body can also be healed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>In the derivation of the Tianxuan Mirror, it is similar to the power of the mutual generation of the Five Elements. After the fusion of the Five Elements, there is a certain possibility of entering a wonderful state of boundless fullness.</p><p></p><p>In the changes between fullness and emptiness, it is like the source of life brought by a person's breathing, constantly generating an endless power that can nourish and strengthen the soul.</p><p></p><p>With the blessing of this kind of power, even if the soul suffers a heavy blow, it can slowly recover relying solely on itself.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary combative divine skills are actually of no practical use to me," Li Fan secretly pondered.</p><p></p><p>"For those weaker than me, I can directly suppress them with the "Binding Insects" divine skill. For those stronger than me, the "Heaven-Breaking Mind Sword" and the "Thread Cutting Life" divine skills are enough to compete with them."</p><p></p><p>"And if I really encounter an opponent so powerful that I cannot resist, I'll just have to admit defeat."</p><p></p><p>"For me, the more life-saving secret methods, especially those related to the soul, the better."</p><p></p><p>The inexplicable impact caused by Mr. Bai's double creating a great sense of crisis within Li Fan. He had no choice but to take it seriously.</p><p></p><p>Without any fickle thoughts, Li Fan, firm in what he needed, set his target in his mind. Read Chapter 28 at xhsux.com.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the immensely lush divine skill tree in front of him gradually became dim from its branches to its leaves.</p><p></p><p>All the demonstrated divine skills disappeared in an instant, leaving only a bare branch standing between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Then, it turned into a glow and shot straight towards Li Fan's sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>It was like a earth-shattering explosion happening in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>With the unbearable bright light, numerous detailed divine skill information appeared at once.</p><p></p><p>It felt like someone was rudely stirring his sea of consciousness with a stick.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt like his head was about to explode at any moment, the unimaginable pain made him involuntarily groan.</p><p></p><p>But in the world of the Tianxuan Mirror, there were only countless black and white lines representing rules, and no physical sound existed.</p><p></p><p>So to outsiders, Li Fan's thread-like figure seemed to be greatly impacted.</p><p></p><p>Shaking violently, swaying.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan noticed that there were one or two black lines from his body constantly detaching under this drastic change.</p><p></p><p>Dissolving and dissolving within this space.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Li Fan felt a bit inexplicably weakened.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart sank, concentrating his mind, he began to absorb and process the data that the Tianxuan Mirror had infused into his mind.</p><p></p><p>But the complexity of this divine skill was beyond his imagination.</p><p></p><p>With his current mind, after processing for a long time, there was no sign of reducing the redundant data.</p><p></p><p>"The amount of data contained in this divine skill is too vast, at this rate..." Li Fan's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, half of his thread-like figure had dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Should I give up on this divine skill and wait for another time?" </p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan suppressed this natural emerging thought.</p><p></p><p>Although he was surprised but not confused, he thought of a better way to handle the situation.</p><p></p><p>Under the final disc, the crystal of the Dao in Li Fan's control suddenly burst with a strong azure light.</p><p></p><p>Similar to the white light generated when the Tianxuan Mirror infused the divine skill previously, this blue light instantly swept through Li Fan's entire sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Like an endless sea constantly hitting, gradually washing away the messy footprints on the shore.</p><p></p><p>With the blue light flickering, the divine skill data that had filled Li Fan's sea of consciousness was gradually absorbed by the Dao crystal.</p><p></p><p>"With the Dao crystal, there's no need to rush things. I can completely store it for now and study it slowly later."</p><p></p><p>As the crisis slowly subsided, Li Fan, with his thoughts back in order, secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>When all the divine skill data he named as the "Infinite Fullness Law" were almost completely absorbed by the Dao crystal.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan observed the Dao crystal that seemed to have reached a certain limit hidden beneath the surface and couldn't help but be surprised.</p><p></p><p>The originally clear blue Dao crystal was no longer transparent. The blue color seemed to overflow at any moment, and he could even see them constantly shaking.</p><p></p><p>There were faint cracks on the surface of the crystal.</p><p></p><p>"This... </p><p></p><p>"It was said that the divine skills at the highest were only at the realm of transformation. How could the data volume be so terrifying?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was a bit puzzled for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Although he was not sure what the divine skills of other transformative cultivators were like, Li Fan was certain that his "Infinite Fullness Law" was definitely not comparable to ordinary divine skills at the transforming realm.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Tianxuan Mirror has discovered something and left some kind of secret entrance?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was startled in his heart and couldn't help but have this thought.</p><p></p><p>But after all, it was just his own speculation. It might just be scaring himself.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Li Fan chose to stay still for the time being.</p><p></p><p>He did not start learning the "Infinite Fullness Law" nor did he delete the stored divine skill data.</p><p></p><p>Coming back to his senses from the comprehension, Li Fan first looked at the two cultivators around him.</p><p></p><p>Deng Mingshi seemed to still be selecting and deducing which divine skill to choose.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 890</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>From afar, one could smell the corruption and foul odor emanating from it.</p><p></p><p>Some of the earth mounds were dug up by well-meaning individuals.</p><p></p><p>Inside, besides some black putrid liquid, there was nothing else.</p><p></p><p>It was said that even the Wuxian Alliance had sent someone to investigate here.</p><p></p><p>After an unsuccessful investigation, the area resembling a festering sore on the earth was entirely removed.</p><p></p><p>Who would have known that just after less than half a year's peace, these continuous small mounds reappeared.</p><p></p><p>So, the alliance sent people once again to deal with them.</p><p></p><p>This happened three times, yet these sores stubbornly persisted.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was left unresolved, being deemed a kind of existence similar to "weird."</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan knew that the reason for this abnormality in the area was not something weird at all.</p><p></p><p>Rather, it was the remnant consciousness attached to countless swords, distorted and corrupted over thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>"Can't blame the Wuxian Alliance for half-heartedly handling it."</p><p></p><p>"Even if an ordinary reconciler were to come, if they weren't well-versed in the way of the sword, they probably wouldn't even notice the abnormality here."</p><p></p><p>Thinking so, Li Fan activated the Countering Five Elements Life-Extinction Sword.</p><p></p><p>In his sight, the scene ahead suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>Countless black shadows drifted out of those swollen mounds.</p><p></p><p>Like ghosts, their eyes emitting a crimson light, glaring at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>From all around came incessant and unintelligible mutterings, akin to screams but filled with a sense of resentment and curses.</p><p></p><p>The whispers seemed to pierce through his eardrums, reaching directly into Li Fan's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Even if he closed his hearing or severed his consciousness, he couldnâ€™t stop it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan furrowed his brows slightly, knowing that this was a necessary step before entering the Sword Tomb of the Heavenly Sword Sect, so he had to stay true to himself and persevere through this eerie and jarring auditory assault.</p><p></p><p>As the crimson-eyed shadows saw Li Fan's indifference, they became enraged one after another.</p><p></p><p>Transforming into black lines, they rushed towards Li Fan fiercely.</p><p></p><p>As they drew closer, the appearance of the shadows became clearer.</p><p></p><p>Some looked like freshly dead, decaying bodies, flesh rotting and infested with maggots.</p><p></p><p>Others appeared as if they were being roasted by fire, bodies dissolving in a horrifying manner.</p><p></p><p>And some seemed like flesh and blood cut into countless pieces.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Their commonality was that these corpses all bore a resemblance to Li Fan!</p><p></p><p>At the sight of them, a myriad of ways Li Fan could meet death flashed through his mind!</p><p></p><p>It was not just a fantasy but felt more like a real and vivid hallucination.</p><p></p><p>Even his body could sense corresponding feelings of pain.</p><p></p><p>"A little trick."</p><p></p><p>"Don't say I have the Immortal Heart Curse protecting me; all methods are unnecessary. Even if inadvertently hit, with the means of continuously reincarnating the body above the Nascent Realm of the new law... "</p><p></p><p>"Decent move, but unfortunately outdated."</p><p></p><p>Thinking so, Li Fan let these shadows engulf him.</p><p></p><p>Then, the Five Elements Cave faintly rumbled, and in the blink of an eye, another body reappeared.</p><p></p><p>More shadows emerged from the mounds, screaming and flying towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>In this way, Li Fan kept reconstructing his body, eventually spreading the shadows from the near-ten thousand mounds in the area all over him.</p><p></p><p>Each time a shadow eroded him, Li Fan felt his body "sink" slightly.</p><p></p><p>Not sinking into the ground, but descending into another space.</p><p></p><p>These shadows were like a bunch of water ghosts pulling Li Fan into the world they inhabited.</p><p></p><p>When completely submerged, the scene before him changed, and Li Fan finally entered the Sword Tomb.</p><p></p><p>There was not much difference from what Shuofeng had described; thousands of half-buried swords leaned on the earth.</p><p></p><p>All curved slightly towards the center, as if paying respect to their emperor.</p><p></p><p>The arrival of this outsider, Li Fan, did not elicit any response from them.</p><p></p><p>Upon close observation of these seemingly decaying swords, Li Fan found that instead of becoming more decrepit, they seemed to be getting purer under the cleansing of the Sword of the Heavenly Sword.</p><p></p><p>"The black shadows above are the remnants of killing intent, obsession, and desires from those slaughtered by swords attached to these countless swords."</p><p></p><p>"In this purely sword world, they gradually have no place to stand and are slowly being eliminated."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan manipulated the Five Elements Life-Extinction Sword, disguising himself as a sword. He remained motionless, observing his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"If there are no external disturbances, under the subtle influence of the sword, the thousands of swords in this Sword Tomb might truly shed their physical forms and become conceptual existences."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes showed a look of wonder.</p><p></p><p>"What is this, a man reaching the pinnacle and his dog ascending to heaven?"</p><p></p><p>"It's no wonder he was awakened by Mr. Bai."</p><p></p><p>Thinking so, Li Fan finally took the first step forward.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, his expression slightly changed.</p><p></p><p>Because at that moment, around him, thousands of swords sent out a burst of sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly displeased with his "interference."</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's perception, these outwardly decaying swords finally revealed their dazzling true colors.</p><p></p><p>Some swords were fiery red like flames; some exuded a cyan blue aura; some were pitch black with a heavy smell of blood; some gleamed like gold with thunderous power coiling around them...</p><p></p><p>Although they were just outer swords in the Sword Tomb, after undergoing thousands of years of the true intentions of the sword, they were no longer in the realm of ordinary objects.</p><p></p><p>Every one of them could be considered a top-grade sword!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly, the intent of the Countering Five Elements Life-Extinction Sword bursting forth.</p><p></p><p>With countless sword intents directed at him, he further advanced.</p><p></p><p>This time, he offended even more swords.</p><p></p><p>Countless sword scars and blood appeared on Li Fan's body instantly.</p><p></p><p>Even his soul seemed to be slashed and faintly ached by the sword aura.</p><p></p><p>"I can't fight back, I can only endure quietly."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, all the swords in the Sword Tomb will consider me an enemy and attack together."</p><p></p><p>"Even the wooden sword in the center will strike."</p><p></p><p>Feeling a certain sense, Li Fan temporarily canceled his soul-burning state.</p><p></p><p>He fully operated the Infinite Empty Law, stepping forward with great strides.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, he truly experienced what it meant to have thousands of swords attacking alongside him.</p><p></p><p>His body was already covered in wounds, and even with the support of the Five Elements Cave power providing continuous rebirth, he could barely maintain a human form.</p><p></p><p>Although his soul quickly healed after being heavily damaged, that extreme sense of pain could not be avoided.</p><p></p><p>"How comfortable Shuofeng must be."</p><p></p><p>"He doesn't even have to care about the swords' attacks. With just the golden armor granted by his old lady, he could stroll leisurely and walk to the center of the Sword Tomb."</p><p></p><p>In pain, Li Fan recalled Shuofeng's description, unable to help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>Despite complaining, the combined might of thousands of swords in the tomb did not stop Li Fan in the slightest.</p>

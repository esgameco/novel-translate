        <h1>Chapter 786</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Once this statement was made, it seemed to have a huge impact on Chen Tianhai or perhaps the disciples of the Taiyan Sect in the Huadao Stone Mother. </p><p></p><p>In an instant, all the blue phantoms in the suspended city stopped their activities and turned their attention towards Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if the entire city had fallen into absolute stillness, with only a deep blue hue quietly circulating.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai lightly stomped his foot once again.</p><p></p><p>The walls in the space became no longer transparent, blocking the view inside and outside.</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai also returned to his normal cultivator appearance.</p><p></p><p>"From the current situation, we indeed cannot rule out the possibility you mentioned."</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai's tone became quite heavy, "In fact, as one of the few beings that could threaten our existence."</p><p></p><p>"We have conducted multiple deductions on the possible situations inside the Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>"But, firstly, the known information is too little. And secondly..."</p><p></p><p>"All attempts to explore the Immortal Ruins have been ineffective, leading nowhere. Therefore, we cannot verify the reliability of the deductions."</p><p></p><p>As Chen Tianhai explained, he looked towards Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai smiled, "But without the Huadao Stone, what do you have to trade with me?"</p><p></p><p>"Do I look like someone who is so kind-hearted and gives benefits to others for free?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai carefully assessed Xu Bai and nodded, "Indeed, from your appearance."</p><p></p><p>"But we won't pin our hopes on others."</p><p></p><p>"I believe there is something that might interest you."</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai extended his left hand and inserted it directly into his own brain.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, there was no scene of brain matter or fresh blood gushing out. As soon as his hand touched his brain, it turned into a phantom.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Chen Tianhai's head seemed to split into numerous small blue squares, constantly flashing.</p><p></p><p>This scene looked quite bizarre.</p><p></p><p>After feeling around for a moment, Chen Tianhai finally withdrew his hand.</p><p></p><p>He showed Xu Bai and Fang Zaiji what was in his palm.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Xu Bai narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>A miniature version of the floating city silently floated in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the Huadao Stone Mother, it was not deep blue but rather like glass, sparkling and fragile.</p><p></p><p>"A one-time copy of the Huadao Stone Mother. Inspired by the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance's 'Heavenly Profound Mirror', it is a relatively independent entity but still possesses some of the Stone Mother's abilities," explained Chen Tianhai without any emotion.</p><p></p><p>"What is it for?" Fang Zaiji's eyes lit up as he reached out to grab the miniature suspended city. </p><p></p><p>But he grasped nothing.</p><p></p><p>Both Chen Tianhai and the Stone Mother's copy instantly turned into illusions, inaccessible.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji frowned.</p><p></p><p>"In the Stone Mother copy, all the information of the entity is contained, as well as the energy to drive a simulation."</p><p></p><p>"You can experience the future deduced by the Huadao Stone Mother through this simulation." Reflecting Chen Tianhai's words, a dazzling light suddenly burst from the Stone Mother copy in his hand.</p><p></p><p>In the white light, countless scenes seemed to flash by quickly.</p><p></p><p>"A simulation? Is that reliable?" Clearly, Fang Zaiji seemed to be hearing about this for the first time and didn't seem to believe it much.</p><p></p><p>While Xu Bai was staring intently at the Stone Mother copy, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>As the brightness of the white light gradually dimmed, the rapidly changing scenes within it also slowly came to a halt.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? How come I and the Sect Master are inside?" Fang Zaiji noticed something strange at this moment and asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"According to the results of this simulation, you should agree to our trade request," Chen Tianhai crushed the Stone Mother copy in his hand. After a moment, as he had said.</p><p></p><p>Scenes of the trade between Xu Bai and them appeared in the area.</p><p></p><p>Although upon closer observation, some details differed from the real world, seeing one's "future" still made one feel uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"You seem a bit too confident. Master, let's not be deceived by him," Fang Zaiji seemed somewhat annoyed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai, on the other hand, looked calmly at the scenes constantly changing within the Stone Mother copy. </p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, he suddenly asked, "The Heavenly Profound Mirror enters the body, revealing all the secrets of the cultivator. Does the Heavenly Profound Mirror see everything?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai smiled, "It depends on you."</p><p></p><p>"The closer the data is to the real situation, the more accurate the results of the simulation. We have secluded ourselves here in the Taixuan Cave for thousands of years. Although we correct the deductions of the Huadao Stone Mother every period, we can only ensure superficial consistency."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Realm is secretive, perhaps even the legendary Transcendent Being who passes down laws would not dare claim to be 'all-knowing.'"</p><p></p><p>"The Stone Mother copy does not have the ability to comprehend everything like the Heavenly Profound Mirror. Rather, the user needs to supplement their own data. If one wishes to conceal something deliberately, it is possible. However, deviations may appear in the results of the deductions,‚Äù Chen Tianhai explained calmly.</p><p></p><p>"At the beginning, the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance also said the same. That the Heavenly Profound Mirror can be seen as an individual entity, not connected to the Heavenly Profound Mirror. Cultivators are free to use it with peace of mind."</p><p></p><p>"But what happened later..." Fang Zaiji sneered.</p><p></p><p>"We in the Taiyan Sect are different," Chen Tianhai suddenly became very serious, "Here, lies are absolutely prohibited."</p><p></p><p>"The world within the Stone Mother is built on real deductions. Any false information could lead to the collapse of the subsequent deduced world," Chen Tianhai explained briefly.</p><p></p><p>"You may not believe it. But that doesn't change the fact."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fang Zaiji showed a skeptical expression, while Xu Bai nodded," I believe."</p><p></p><p>"Then let's make the trade."</p><p></p><p>Such decisiveness greatly surprised the two present.</p><p></p><p>"Master..." Fang Zaiji hesitated.</p><p></p><p>After a brief moment of confusion, Chen Tianhai quickly took out another piece of Stone Mother copy from his brain.</p><p></p><p>And Xu Bai, as if prepared, took out a projection stone from his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the trade was completed.</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai directly played the image of the Medicine King Cauldron flying out of the Xuanhuang Realm and being attracted by the Immortal Ruins recorded in the projection stone.</p><p></p><p>It was repeated three times.</p><p></p><p>As the light and shadow faded away, Chen Tianhai looked serious, "It seems you were right.</p><p></p><p>"If the data you provided is true."</p>

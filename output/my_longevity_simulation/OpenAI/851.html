        <div class="content">
            <p>Ji Shaoli patted Wei Qizheng's shoulder, his eyes showing an encouraging look.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the secret room, everyone saw Wei Qizheng completely transformed, and couldn't help but secretly admire.</p><p></p><p>They didn't know what secret technique Ji Shaoli had used on him, as all the previous apprehension and tension had completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In its place was full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli and Wei Qizheng did not explain.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, City Lord is still waiting, I will leave first," Wei Qizheng said as he bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Then, early congratulations on Brother Wei's success!"</p><p></p><p>"Wei little brother, if you become wealthy, don't forget us!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone's attitude towards Wei Qizheng had completely changed, and they quickly returned the courtesy.</p><p></p><p>Wei Qizheng nodded slightly and left the Hai Xuan Island through the teleportation array.</p><p></p><p>Watching his gradually disappearing figure, He Zhenghao sighed with a bit of pride, "I have long seen that Brother Wei is extraordinary, destined for success. But I didn't expect it to come so fast! It's not in vain that I've taken care of him before."</p><p></p><p>"Comparisons are odious. We prepared for the exam more than a year in advance, but still couldn't match his last-minute brilliance! Sigh..."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh. If Wei Dao You really gets selected as one of the Thirty-Three Immortal candidates, and directly ascends to Unity Path in the future. Wonâ€™t I be able to be considered a brother or disciple of the Unity Path Immortal Lord? He wouldn't turn his back on me then, right?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>People's reactions were varied.</p><p></p><p>But overall, they couldn't hide their envy and jealousy.</p><p></p><p>Only Ji Shaoli's eyes were flickering.</p><p></p><p>The Wan Xian Alliance attached great importance to hosting the selection plan for the Thirty-Three Immortal candidates.</p><p></p><p>To be safe, he did not try to harm Wei Qizheng in any way.</p><p></p><p>Even the fragment that separated called the "End Disintegration Disk" was just an individual entity. It had no connection to the mother body in his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>It only silently recorded all the surrounding sensations, and it would only transmit the collected information when it was completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Such caution was to prevent any clues about Wei Qizheng from being discovered.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Ji Shaoli had a vague premonition in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Wei Qizheng was likely to be successfully selected as one of the Thirty-Three Immortal candidates. But similarly, wanting to see him again might be a long time away.</p><p></p><p>Wei Qizheng's summons to the Immortal Alliance Headquarters was not known to many cultivators on the Hai Xuan Island.</p><p></p><p>He left quietly.</p><p></p><p>On the third day after his departure, which was the tenth day after the end of the exam, the results were announced.</p><p></p><p>Some were happy, some were worried.</p><p></p><p>But on Hai Xuan Island, it was full of joy and laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Six candidates registered, all six passed! If this news spreads, it will definitely cause a sensation!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, those who didn't join our mutual aid association before will definitely regret it!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the excitement, He Zhenghao suddenly frowned, worrying and said, "What if jealous people report us? What should we do?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as this was said, the room fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't...right?"</p><p></p><p>A hint of worry flashed in everyone's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, what are you afraid of? A clear conscience fears no accusation!" At this moment, Ji Shaoli said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"It's just hitting the right questions! The whole Wan Xian Alliance has countless organizations studying the exam and focusing on the questions. How does one more make a difference?" Ji Shaoli justified himself.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao and the others were slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>But then Ji Shaoli coldly added, "Furthermore, who can report us? Leaking exam questions is a serious offense, without solid evidence, who dares to speak nonsense!"</p><p></p><p>"If there are really some shortsighted people..."</p><p></p><p>"Who knows who will die first!"</p><p></p><p>These words were tough and made everyone start to think, slowly dispelling their worries.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's not talk about these unlucky things. Since you have all passed the exam, what are your thoughts on where you want to work in the future?"</p><p></p><p>Upon registering for the exam, there was a preliminary indication of the region and position preferences.</p><p></p><p>However, the specific assignment of positions would still be determined by the Immortal Alliance Headquarters.</p><p></p><p>It was based on various factors such as the cultivator's origin, cultivation level, and potential.</p><p></p><p>The general principle was to assign most people locally and transfer elite cultivators to the Immortal Alliance Headquarters.</p><p></p><p>But occasionally, there were special cases.</p><p></p><p>However, they were all assigned to this remote place in the Cloud Sea because of the pressure from the Heng Family.</p><p></p><p>Most cultivators could only resign themselves to the assigned positions.</p><p></p><p>But for those with backgrounds and connections, it meant maximizing their own benefits.</p><p></p><p>Most of them were already satisfied with passing the exam.</p><p></p><p>But after hearing Ji Shaoli's words, it seemed like there was still room for maneuvering.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, everyone became a little tempted.</p><p></p><p>They quietly communicated with Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao, however, hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"He Dao You, what do you think?" Ji Shaoli asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a while, He Zhenghao ultimately responded, "If possible, I would like to go to Tianyunzhou. Tianquan Prefecture is also fine."</p><p></p><p>Neither were Tianyu Prefecture but both were very close.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli instantly understood He Zhenghao's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, he looked at everyone and said, "This exam is special. I can't guarantee the final outcome, so I can only do my best."</p><p></p><p>"Success or failure, it all depends on your own fortunes!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone understood this well and thanked Ji Shaoli once again.</p><p></p><p>"Before the final results are out, make good use of this time to practice. If you can advance to a higher realm, then things will change again."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao and the others all nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>With hope, they began to practice more earnestly than ever before.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Ji Shaoli started leveraging his financial power, trying to insert as many influences as possible into the Immortal Alliance's interior.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Sea was destined for destruction, and there was no future in staying there.</p><p></p><p>The activities related to Jing Xuan, Shen Yu Zi, Huang Fu Song, and others to smooth out loose ends were temporarily not mentioned.</p><p></p><p>As the exam came to an end, the attention of the Wan Xian Alliance cultivators shifted to the biggest winners of this exam - the three hundred plus lucky individuals who had passed the initial screening and were heading to the Immortal Alliance Headquarters to participate in the final selection for the Thirty-Three Immortal candidates.</p><p></p><p>After all, reaching the position of Unity Path Immortal Lord...</p><p></p><p>Such influence was beyond comparison with ordinary Immortal Alliance positions.</p><p></p><p>Those who were well-informed quickly compiled a list of these lucky three hundred plus candidates.</p><p></p><p>Detailed information about them also appeared before the eyes of others.</p><p></p><p>After some research, it was found that there was no commonality among them.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation levels of the three hundred plus selected cultivators varied. Ranging from Foundation Building to Nascent Soul, all realms were represented.</p><p></p><p>From lone cultivators without background to core disciples of prominent families, everyone was included.</p><p></p><p>The selection criteria of the Wan Xian Alliance really confused people.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan was also holding this list and studying it.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, there's no Shuo Feng."</p><p></p><p>"Nor the names of those true high-level heirs of the Immortal Alliance seen in previous eras."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p>

        <h1>Chapter 810</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan and Tianyang stood in the sky, their divine consciousness slowly scanning this small world.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but marvel at the wonders of creation.</p><p></p><p>This was a small world where no cultivators or humans existed.</p><p></p><p>Only a species of tree people, born from spirit trees, lived here.</p><p></p><p>In fact, according to the information later lifted by the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance in the 115th generation.</p><p></p><p>This Spirit Wood Realm, thousands of years ago, was once a desolate and lifeless small world.</p><p></p><p>But with the growth of a spirit tree that took root here.</p><p></p><p>The small world gradually became vibrant.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the giant tree not far away, towering thousands of feet high, and the tree people living on it, a hint of regret flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, this tree is already bound to this small world and cannot be transplanted. Otherwise, just cutting its branches and planting them in other small worlds would permanently solve the problem of spiritual energy deficiency."</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Li Fan's blatant and unreserved malice caught the attention of the giant tree.</p><p></p><p>The thousand-foot giant tree suddenly moved without wind.</p><p></p><p>As the branches swayed, tens of thousands of tree people swarmed towards Li Fan like a swarm of locusts.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly: "Seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>"Tianyang!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the call of his senior brother, Tianyang, who was listless, did not understand his meaning and looked at him in confusion.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face twitched.</p><p></p><p>He then pointed to the approaching army of tree people and transmitted his voice, “Be careful not to harm our saplings!”</p><p></p><p>Tianyang finally understood.</p><p></p><p>With a roar, Tianyang's body instantly swelled to the size of a spirit tree.</p><p></p><p>Black flames all over his body burned any tree people daring to approach into ashes in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful not to hurt our sapling!" Li Fan hurriedly conveyed his message.</p><p></p><p>This battle could be said to have no suspense at all.</p><p></p><p>Most of the tree people in the Spirit Wood Realm were only equivalent to the Foundation Building stage.</p><p></p><p>The Nascent Soul-stage tree people were rare.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Core-stage tree people were considered elders among the tree people.</p><p></p><p>The strongest among the tree people was the tribe leader. Able to communicate with the spirit tree itself, they were almost invincible in this realm.</p><p></p><p>But they were only at the Yuan Ying level.</p><p></p><p>Facing Tianyang in the later stage of Nascent Soul, they had no resistance at all.</p><p></p><p>After damaging almost half of the tree people, they could only surrender.</p><p></p><p>The tribe leader of the tree people was quite elegant in appearance. Unlike the rough appearance of other tree people.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal, please spare us!" It sounded somewhat bitter, surprisingly a female voice.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, however, was unmoved: "Submit or die!"</p><p></p><p>The tribe leader of the tree people bowed and said, "We are willing to surrender."</p><p></p><p>"Surrender the Heart of the Spirit Wood, and your tribe will be safe. Don't make me take action, otherwise, this realm will become a scorched earth again." Li Fan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The body of the tribe leader of the tree people trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>She did not understand why this cultivator, who was clearly visiting for the first time, already knew about the existence of the Heart of the Spirit Wood.</p><p></p><p>But at this point, she had no choice.</p><p></p><p>She spat out a green light, slowly flying into Li Fan's hands.</p><p></p><p>Instantly refining it, Li Fan vaguely felt that the spirit tree in this world had become a part of his body.</p><p></p><p>And the life and death of these tree people born from the spirit tree also rested on his whim.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Wood Realm now belonged to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The cross-tier battle strike was something that the tree people could not resist at all.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan had come to the center of the spirit tree.</p><p></p><p>There was a huge cavity here.</p><p></p><p>Billions of roots, from all over the Spirit Wood Realm, converged here.</p><p></p><p>And all the countless branches of the spirit wood also originated from here.</p><p></p><p>Allowing the spirit wood to sense anything happening in this small world.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the change of ownership of the Heart of the Spirit Wood, all these effects had been transferred to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the spirit tree, he could sense every detail of the small world.</p><p></p><p>A familiar feeling rushed to Li Fan's head.</p><p></p><p>"It's the same path as occupying the Beasts Realm with Xiao Hei."</p><p></p><p>"However, this world can rejuvenate, and the credit lies with this Spirit Tree. So, compared to before, it's simpler."</p><p></p><p>"Let's try the Heavenly Transformation technique."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, on the ground of the Spirit Wood Realm, mountains, rivers, and streams suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was reshaping this world at will, much like what Mr. Bai had done in his own Heavenly Cave before.</p><p></p><p>However, just before half a day had passed, Li Fan's behavior in reshaping the world was abruptly halted.</p><p></p><p>The power of the spirit tree itself could not withstand such extravagance by Li Fan. It needed to rest and adjust.</p><p></p><p>"Boring."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly, his figure flashed, and he arrived at the top of the spirit tree.</p><p></p><p>Looking down at the land of the Spirit Wood Realm, a magnificent and gigantic formation appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Perfectly integrated with the world, without any flaws.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this formation was constantly changing and advancing.</p><p></p><p>"Infinite Formation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In that instant just now, relying on the immense computational power of the Final Dissolution Disk, he had designed a huge formation tailored for the Spirit Wood Realm in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The core idea came from Zhang Zhiliang, the number one formation master of the Congyunhai, with the Infinite Formation.</p><p></p><p>With the existence of the Final Dissolution Disk, the Infinite Formation that he had envisioned was finally completed with the last piece of the puzzle.</p><p></p><p>A formation that was always evolving, limitless.</p><p></p><p>"If the formation is completed, any ordinary method of breaking through the formation will be useless."</p><p></p><p>"Only brute force can solve it."</p><p></p><p>"To cover the scale of the Spirit Wood Realm with the Infinite Formation, you won't be able to break through if there are not five or six combined forces."</p><p></p><p>"If some celestial treasures are used to strengthen the formation further, and combined with the strength of the combined forces at the crucial points."</p><p></p><p>"Without the personal visit of the Supreme Longevity Venerable, it can't be broken!"</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's eyes, the imaginary formation pattern slowly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"As the headquarters of the Ten Thousand Realms Alliance's defense formation, the lineup is enough."</p><p></p><p>"Now what's lacking is the required resources to set up the formation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately thought of the Five Elders Association.</p><p></p><p>At this point in time, the Five Elders Association still had various ideas about the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>They were eager to move.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan had many pieces of information that piqued their interest and could be exchanged among themselves.</p><p></p><p>The only thing to consider this time was who to contact.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Qing'ang's superior, or Tianliang Wang Po.</p><p></p><p>Or...</p><p></p><p>Various figures flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>All these previously absolute confidential matters had turned into trade chips in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, Li Fan had some ideas.</p><p></p><p>Although he had experienced many cycles before, while claiming to be evenly matched, the Five Elders Association's performance was somewhat lacking.</p><p></p><p>"Let me help you all with all my might."</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how deep the foundation of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance really is."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze was profound.</p>

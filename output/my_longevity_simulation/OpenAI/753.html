            <p>However, our research on catalysts that can promote fusion has made significant progress. I believe the birth of the first fusion beast is not far away." Soon, the princess regained her confidence.</p><p></p><p>"The All-Beast Melting Pot, the fusion of blood and flesh..." Xu Bai suddenly remembered the Emperor Yi he had seen in the Meteor Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, the inspiration for the Empire's 【All-Phenomena Melting Pot】 came from this ancestral demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>As the origin of the Yao beasts in the Xuanhuang Realm, the strength of Emperor Yi must be superior to that in the Changsheng Realm.</p><p></p><p>If the Empire could truly successfully mass-produce fusion beasts, even if it weakened many versions, its power could not be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have an evaluation of the specific strength of the refined demonic beasts? If the experiment is successful, can you control them? Aren't you afraid they will turn against you and destroy the Empire?" Xu Bai posed a series of questions.</p><p></p><p>The princess was full of confidence: "The beasts infused into the All-Phenomena Melting Pot are individuals controlled by us through the 【Unity Formula】. When they are refined by the melting pot, although their physical bodies disappear, their bonds remain."</p><p></p><p>"Gather all the mental fluctuations of the 【Unity Formula】 in one place. That will create a device that controls the fusion body. Don't worry about losing control."</p><p></p><p>"And based on previous power assessments, the strength of the fusion bodies we can currently produce should not be weaker than that of the Daoist practitioners in the Xuanhuang Realm..." The princess's words were somewhat hesitant, but she ultimately said slowly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai nodded slightly, this result was within his expectations. However, Xu Bai did not issue any warnings about the Empire's mysterious confidence.</p><p></p><p>He skillfully took out his folding fan and lightly waved it: "Very well, the guide to the Void, the 【Spirit Crystal Marrow】, possible future support for Daoist strength..."</p><p></p><p>"With these, I believe it is enough to persuade the Alliance to offer you protection."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, bring me a few more 【Spirit Crystal Marrows】. Seeing is believing, I'm afraid those old folks won't easily trust." Not concerned about Xu Bai's request, the princess casually threw over ten 【Spirit Crystal Marrows】.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai also did not waste words, after storing them away, he flew towards the Empire's treasury.</p><p></p><p>"Prepare yourselves. If there are no accidents, the next time the elders of the Alliance will come with me for the final inspection."</p><p></p><p>"Those guys are not as easy to deal with as I am."</p><p></p><p>Leaving the treasury, Xu Bai returned to the high tower palace. After giving some instructions, he did not linger there.</p><p></p><p>Turning into a streak of light, he soared into the sky and disappeared from the view of the people of the Empire.</p><p></p><p>"Master Qing..." The princess looked at Xiao Qing, seeming to have many questions in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing, on the other hand, kept looking at Xu Bai's departing figure and did not take her eyes off him for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"The words of this person are hard to distinguish between truth and falsehood. But it can be confirmed that he has no malicious intent. And indeed, the entrance to our world has been hidden by an unknown formation," Xiao Qing said with a hint of melancholy in her tone.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Empire, in the dark void.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Bai was flying away, he suddenly felt a wave of spatial fluctuations around him.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, a 【Void Traveling Dragon】 suddenly appeared next to him. It affectionately rubbed his thigh with its head.</p><p></p><p>It looked somewhat familiar, it was the same one he had tamed when he arrived earlier.</p><p></p><p>Apparently sensing Xu Ke's imminent departure, it actually came to bid farewell.</p><p></p><p>"You little guy, you are quite smart. Well, the beast world is just lacking a leader, so why don't you come with me!" Xu Bai smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>The Void Traveling Dragon was instantly overjoyed and twisted its body, willingly carrying Xu Bai on its back.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, at Xu Bai's signal, it continuously shuttled through the void, heading towards the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Upon returning to the entrance to the deep valley, Xu Bai first took the Void Traveling Dragon into his own cave heaven. And then using the Final Disc, he dissolved the continuous illusion maintained to deceive the Tian Xuan Treasure Mirror.</p><p></p><p>When passing by the entrance of the Changsheng Valley, he did not enter.</p><p></p><p>He quietly released the Void Traveling Dragon and then left alone towards the Tianliang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Changsheng Valley, Li San, who had been informed in advance, looked at the exotic beast in front of him with great wonder.</p><p></p><p>"This inconspicuous creature actually has the ability to shuttle through space," he said, taking the Void Traveling Dragon into the valley and re-covering the entrance.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Bai's permission, how the Dragon would cause trouble and dominate the beast world was briefly mentioned.</p><p></p><p>"We have every reason to suspect that the Tian Xuan Treasure Mirror is constantly monitoring the condition of the cultivators' bodies. If they do not have a certain degree of control over their bodies, the so-called guidance on cultivation advice would not be so accurate and effective," Fang Zaiji said with a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>"Do you really need to point that out? Which Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance cultivator doesn't know that? But they still willingly accept it. After all, compared to advancing their own cultivation, these are not significant," Li San retorted.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, no, you misunderstand me," Fang Zaiji, for once, did not mock Li San, but explained seriously, "If the Tian Xuan Mirror can ascend by measuring the heavens, and the earth, the world, once it has scanned the data of so many cultivators' bodies, what kind of changes will occur?"</p><p></p><p>Once this was said, Li San was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"In the ancient world of cultivating immortals, there is a saying that the human body is the most perfect creation in the world. To ascend to immortality, whether you were originally human or not, you must first transform into a human."</p><p></p><p>"Although it is just a rumor, its truthfulness has long been unverifiable. But the fact that humans can defeat demonic beasts and become the true rulers of the Xuanhuang Realm already illustrates the infinite potential of humanity."</p><p></p><p>"The Tian Xuan Mirror might very well have the idea of transforming into a human form." Fang Zaiji said gravely.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Fang, is this the conclusion you have reached after researching for so long?" Li Fan spoke, interrupting Fang Zaiji's words.</p><p></p><p>In his hands, the Dissolution Disc was several times more crystalline and clear than before.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because the End of All Realms War had already begun, some owners of the Dissolution Discs knew they were no match and had already given up the practice of feeding the discs with formations. In a short period, Li Fan's disc had swallowed three other discs.</p><p></p><p>The last battle for dominance was not far away.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had come to inquire about Fang Zaiji's progress in researching the Final Disc, he did not stop feeding the disc with formation data.</p><p></p><p>Multi-tasking.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have a way to shield the Tian Xuan Treasure Mirror from scanning the bodies of cultivators?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji laughed, "The approach is there, but achieving it is... I'm afraid it's difficult."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji slowly explained the reasons behind the difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"To shield the Tian Xuan Treasure Mirror's perception of the outside world, you only need to temporarily fabricate a single scene with your divine sense."</p><p></p><p>"Likewise, if you want to affect the Tian Xuan Treasure Mirror's probe into your body, then you just need to fabricate a false body."</p><p></p><p>"But... the difficulty lies here."</p><p></p><p>"Although it's just a simple body, it contains countless organs, blood, and even traces of spiritual power operation. It's as if it's a whole world. Unless you have an understanding of the body to a degree comparable to the Tian Xuan Mirror, otherwise, there will inevitably be flaws."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji was somewhat helpless, "The Tian Xuan Treasure Mirror is hidden in the cultivator's sea of consciousness and has already scanned the body at the time of formation. If there are suddenly very obvious differences later on, it will definitely be immediately noticed."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, everyone's physique is different. Trying to achieve complete enlightenment is almost impossible."</p><p></p><p>On hearing Fang Zaiji's reply, Li Fan understood where the difficulty lay in this matter.</p><p></p><p>Even for a Daoist practitioner, it was doubtful whether they could guarantee complete knowledge of their own body, let alone under Daoist level.</p><p></p><p>Having them weave a false body to deceive the Tian Xuan Treasure Mirror would no doubt reveal countless flaws.</p><p></p><p>"To have complete control over oneself..."</p><p></p><p>"【Build Base with Self】."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately thought of these words.</p><p></p><p>But soon, he shook his head slightly. The difficulty of 【Build Base with Self】 was indeed too high, and in all these years in the Xuanhuang Realm, there had not been heard of anyone who had succeeded. Even the talented like Master Yin had left behind significant aftereffects...</p><p></p><p>"Oh? The difficulty of cultivation?" A flash of insight came to Li Fan's mind, having suddenly conjured up a brilliant idea.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Xuan Treasure Mirror, is it not known to guide the cultivators in their practice?</p><p></p><p>What if the Tian Xuan Treasure Mirror were to guide the 【Build Base with Self】 approach, what would happen then?</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan explained the concept of 【Build Base with Self】 to Fang Zaiji and the others, proposing his conjecture.</p><p></p><p>"Building Base with Self, without any external objects. Wonderful, wonderful! In this way, doesn't it break the limitations of the new laws to some extent?" Fang Zaiji exclaimed after hearing it, gasping in amazement.</p><p></p><p>"To come up with such a genius idea, it turns out it's just a Base-Building cultivator... truly..." He felt somewhat incredulous.</p><p></p><p>"But, thinking carefully about it. If with the help of the Tian Xuan Treasure Mirror's all-around scanning ability, perhaps we really can achieve 【Build Base with Self】." After pondering for a moment, Fang Zaiji became somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>Li San also appeared contemplative, "Cultivators cannot know themselves, but they can use the Tian Xuan Treasure Mirror to open up new paths. If successful, returning afterward and summarizing the method of 【Build Base with Self】, it should be able to greatly reduce the difficulty."</p><p></p><p>"If there are exceptionally talented individuals, perhaps they may not be unable to come up with a highly effective method that everyone can follow."</p><p></p><p>"By relying solely on oneself, to achieve 【Build Base with Self】."</p><p></p><p>"It's totally feasible! It's worth a try! If it weren't for my current Daoist cultivation, I'd be itching to give up my practice and start over on the spot to try this miraculous Base-Building technique!" Fang Zaiji was particularly excited.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded, "To leverage the Tian Xuan Treasure Mirror for cultivation, one needs to acquire merit points from the Conquest of the Myriad Realms. It will also be troublesome to ask Elder Liu to arrange for some disciples to carry out this task. For those with low-level Qi-refining strength, it is best to send them in groups."</p>

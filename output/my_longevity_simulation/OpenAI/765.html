        <h1>Chapter 765</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan's methods became increasingly weak.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, Shuofeng became braver as the battles went on.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Li Fan left citing that he was truly no match for it and needed to contemplate new divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Instead of going elsewhere, he went straight to the Tianquan Prefecture where the Tianxuan Mirror was located, utilizing the privileges of level 35 permissions.</p><p></p><p>It was different from what he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Instead of creating a passage directly to the Tianxuan Mirror space, he was informed of a time and location to go to.</p><p></p><p>At that time, there would be someone to lead him, and no delays would be tolerated.</p><p></p><p>According to the subtle aura the other party exuded, Li Fan judged that Wang Wan was at least at the level of Nascent Divinity cultivation. He replied politely, "Greetings, fellow daoist. I am Li Fan."</p><p></p><p>After introducing each other, they nodded slightly and ceased further communication.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan noted, "The level 35 permission is not something that can be reached just by having a strong cultivation base. There must be various connections within the Immortal Alliance as well. That's why even though I only have the cultivation base of mid Yuan Ying stage, he still treats me quite politely."</p><p></p><p>After a while, a middle-aged cultivator in a blue Daoist robe with a tuft of goat's beard arrived on the mountaintop.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging greetings with Li Fan and Wang Wan, they all remained silent, waiting quietly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan learned the name of the woman in white, Deng Mingsi.</p><p></p><p>After a period of time, another female cultivator arrived at the mountaintop in a tightly bound white attire.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging greetings with Li Fan and Wang Wan, they all remained silent, waiting quietly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan learned the name of the woman in white, Deng Mingsi.</p><p></p><p>After this, no more cultivators arrived.</p><p></p><p>After a stick of incense had burned down, faint spatial fluctuations appeared above the mountaintop.</p><p></p><p>As if an invisible thread had cut out a transparent door, a black-clothed cultivator walked out from it.</p><p></p><p>After sweeping a glance to confirm the identities of the three, the black-clothed cultivator solemnly said, "Follow me."</p><p></p><p>Without any noticeable action, the transparent door instantly expanded to envelop Li Fan and the other two.</p><p></p><p>Then, a burst of dazzling light erupted.</p><p></p><p>The door, along with the individuals inside it, disappeared.</p><p></p><p>A familiar sensation welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Similar to when he infiltrated the Roots of Heaven and Earth in the Tianling Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>His whole body, flesh, bone, and everything seemed to dissolve and transform.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan regained consciousness, he found that he had once again turned into a comical figure made entirely of black and white lines.</p><p></p><p>However, it was different from the Roots of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>In this vast black and white space, there seemed to be a mysterious force at work.</p><p></p><p>It suppressed Li Fan, preventing his own lines from quietly dissipating.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan silently comprehended this subtle suppression on him, thinking to himself, "This should be the protection measure of the Tianxuan Mirror towards us.</p><p></p><p>"Given that we are here to comprehend divine abilities, without this layer of protection, an ordinary cultivator would probably be completely assimilated by this space in no time.</p><p></p><p>"However, based on my experience in the Roots of Heaven and Earth and my understanding of similar divine abilities like 'Thread Cutting Life', I should be able to survive longer than others."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced around.</p><p></p><p>He saw Deng Mingsi and Wang Wan, both now consisting of lines like him.</p><p></p><p>But there was a slight difference between their figures and their original bodies.</p><p></p><p>Deng Mingsi's body appeared slightly smaller compared to the two male cultivators, looking like she was only thirteen or fourteen years old.</p><p></p><p>Wang Wan, though his physique had not changed much, his appearance had transformed from the middle-aged cultivator with a goat's beard to that of an old man.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Wang Wan had been to this place before and was heading towards it familiarly.</p><p></p><p>Deng Mingsi, on the other hand, initially seemed confused and fearful.</p><p></p><p>However, her mental fortitude was good as she quickly adapted and followed Wang Wan towards the center of the black and white space.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan followed suit.</p><p></p><p>While flying, Li Fan noticed that this place was different from where he had seen the Tianxuan Mirror creating its own mirror in his past life.</p><p></p><p>It was not as vast, rather more independent.</p><p></p><p>But there was still a hidden connection.</p><p></p><p>"The essence is still the Tianxuan Mirror, but the division of labor is different," Li Fan realized.</p><p></p><p>This place was constructed like a suspended platform with countless vertical and horizontal lines.</p><p></p><p>Deng Mingsi and Wang Wan had landed on the platform.</p><p></p><p>The lines representing their feet became extremely messy, dispersing into countless black thin lines, resembling tiny tentacles connecting to the ground below.</p><p></p><p>This scene looked somewhat eerie.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan did the same.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the scenery reappeared in a colorful manner.</p><p></p><p>Countless characters fell before his eyes like a waterfall.</p><p></p><p>Finally, a few lines of small characters were formed.</p><p></p><p>"Practitioner Li Fan has successfully connected."</p><p></p><p>"Please demonstrate the desired divine ability in your spiritual consciousness."</p><p></p><p>"Based on Practitioner Li Fan's current cultivation, the power limit of this derived divine ability is restricted to the Nascent Divinity level."</p><p></p><p>"Remaining derivation time..."</p><p></p><p>Lastly, a continuously flashing countdown.</p><p></p><p>Only ten hours.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Tianxuan Mirror, one must exercise caution.</p><p></p><p>But this opportunity was not easy to come by and needed to ensure maximum benefit.</p><p></p><p>The astounding 'Chaos' divine ability cannot be showcased.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan had already made a decision.</p><p></p><p>"The space here in front of the Tianxuan Mirror is similar to that inside the Roots of Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>"If my guess is correct, it might be its way of analyzing the birth process of the world."</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case..."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, various insights about the 'Reverse Five Elements Life-Death Sword' surged into his mind.</p><p></p><p>The 'Reverse Five Elements Life-Death Sword' was a divine ability Li Fan had comprehended based on the foundation of the Great Five Elements Annihilation Sword and his understanding of the 'way of life and death'.</p><p></p><p>But with only a Yuan Ying cultivation, his grasp of the 'way of life and death' was still quite superficial.</p><p></p><p>After all, his inherent talent and insight were not as extraordinary as his original body, Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Since its realization, the practical use was not significant, mainly treated as another method for annihilation.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the creative function of 'life', it was currently limited to merely holding spirit stones in one hand, a quite insignificant ability.</p><p></p><p>"Hoping for some surprises," Li Fan thought.</p><p></p><p>He found that as he meditated on the 'Reverse Five Elements Life-Death Sword' divine ability in his mind, the lines connecting him to the platform beneath his feet quivered as if being gently blown by the wind, swaying ceaselessly.</p><p></p><p>The black color of the lines became denser, indicating some kind of transmission.</p><p></p><p>Merely a moment later, the feedback from the Tianxuan Mirror arrived.</p><p></p><p>Various scenes appeared before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He could vaguely see the process of the birth of the Five Elements Cave Heaven and numerous fleeting shadows flashed successively, forming a tree with countless branches, rising from the bottom up.</p>

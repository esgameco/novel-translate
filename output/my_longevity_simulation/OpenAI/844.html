        <h1>Chapter 844</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Cough." He Zhenghao cleared his throat lightly, but there was a sense of confidence in his chest.</p><p></p><p>"It's a blessing in disguise, a blessing in disguise!" The others also sighed repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Although we have already taken two rounds of special medicines, we cannot be negligent when it comes to the Immortal Mortal Miasma," at this moment, Ji Shaoli warned in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Recently, a quite sensational incident occurred. In our Congyun Sea, a cultivator named Wen Yue relied on the fact that he had been infected with the Immortal Mortal Miasma, claiming to have acquired immunity. He wanted to test whether the Immortal Mortal Miasma stored in mortal bodies would have any effect on him."</p><p></p><p>"In front of many cultivators, he poured mortal blood into his own body."</p><p></p><p>"As a result, he died on the spot, turning into dried bones. The scene was truly tragic!" Ji Shaoli sighed.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao and the others all froze: "Is there such an idiot in the world? Playing with his life like that?"</p><p></p><p>Then they were shocked: "So, does this mean that our immunity to the Immortal Mortal Miasma is just an illusion?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli nodded slightly: "On this matter, the Immortal Alliance has already issued a public notice and provided an explanation. The existence of the Immortal Mortal Miasma is part of the natural order. We can only adapt to its presence, but it will not disappear."</p><p></p><p>"So, in the end, nothing has really changed. It's just that many cultivators died in vain?" He Zhenghao couldn't help but feel a little lost.</p><p></p><p>Pei Tuo added with resentment, "Damn it! If I achieve the Dao in the future, I will definitely defy this fate!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Pei has great aspirations!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd sighed with mixed emotions.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Ji Shaoli waved his hand to interrupt them.</p><p></p><p>"Complaining is fine. All we can do is endure and survive."</p><p></p><p>"Actually, the outbreak of the Immortal Mortal Miasma might not be a bad thing for us surviving cultivators," Ji Shaoli said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? How so?" Everyone's gaze focused on Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know how many inner-system cultivators in the Congyun Sea have been reduced during this disaster?" Ji Shaoli asked mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the sudden spark in everyone's eyes, Ji Shaoli transmitted a number.</p><p></p><p>"More than five hundred?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>"Yes. If the Congyun Sea is like this, you can imagine the situation in the entire realm," Ji Shaoli said.</p><p></p><p>"The vacant positions left by the fallen cultivators are opportunities for us survivors." Ji Shaoli said with a mysterious tone.</p><p></p><p>"While the majority of cultivators are still immersed in the pain caused by the Immortal Mortal Miasma disaster, those with foresight have already begun to quietly operate in the background."</p><p></p><p>These words struck a chord with everyone present.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Ji, does this mean we should still participate in the grand examination?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, although we have made full preparations. But this time, the competition in the examination will definitely be more intense..."</p><p></p><p>As the crowd's expressions varied, Ji Shaoli said in a low voice, "If everything goes as expected, the scale of this examination may exceed expectations. It's not just about recruiting more cultivators, but also about the quality of positions!"</p><p></p><p>"Those positions that would have taken decades of training to advance in the past, this time, those with outstanding performance could directly be appointed!"</p><p></p><p>"So my suggestion is to take the risk and participate in the examination!"</p><p></p><p>"Who knows, you might change your fate by leaps and bounds!"</p><p></p><p>The people present, especially He Zhenghao, suddenly looked excited.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, besides the positions within the system, scarce resources such as techniques and spiritual caves may also be made available. In short, the Immortal Alliance's primary task now is to restore the situation to the level before the disaster at all costs," Ji Shaoli added.</p><p></p><p>"Does that mean, Friend Ji, the Immortal Alliance is afraid that the Five Elders' faction will take advantage of this current recovery period to make a move?" someone asked.</p><p></p><p>"But it's strange. When the Immortal Alliance was most severely damaged before, the Five Elders' faction surprisingly didn't take advantage of the situation."</p><p></p><p>"There's nothing incomprehensible about this. If we're facing an outbreak of the Immortal Mortal Miasma on our side, how could they remain unscathed on their side? In my opinion, the losses on the Five Elders' faction's end must be significant as well. Now it's about who can recover faster and gain an advantage in the game."</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, this is indeed a rare opportunity for us ordinary cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Listening quietly to the discussions, Ji Shaoli did not explain.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had previously made contact with the Five Elders' faction through Lin Ling.</p><p></p><p>While profiting from the Immortal Alliance's examination question bank.</p><p></p><p>He also secretly investigated the situation of the Five Elders' faction under the outbreak of the Immortal Mortal Miasma.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the devastated Wanshen Alliance, their losses were considerably smaller.</p><p></p><p>Due to the delayed spread of the Immortal Mortal Miasma, when the news reached the territory of the Five Elders' faction, they had already learned of the outbreak in the Wanshen Alliance.</p><p></p><p>They took precautions in advance.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the Five Elders' faction was ruled by five dignitaries.</p><p></p><p>Orders were issued one after another, and the cultivators all obediently stayed at home, greatly slowing down the spread of the Immortal Mortal Miasma.</p><p></p><p>The key was how to deal with the Immortal Mortal Miasma.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Five Elders' faction had more detailed records than the Wanshen Alliance.</p><p></p><p>They did not disclose the specific measures.</p><p></p><p>However, the Five Elders' faction did not suffer much in this disaster, which was true.</p><p></p><p>The only thing that puzzled the Five Elders' faction was that the Heavenly Sovereign personally issued an order vetoing any plans to attack the Wanshen Alliance during the turmoil.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Sovereign's orders must be obeyed.</p><p></p><p>They could only accumulate strength and attempt to launch a fatal blow to the Wanshen Alliance.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the world of the beast races.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling and Tian Yang did not unleash their true strength.</p><p></p><p>They only suppressed their combat power to the Nascent God Realm, fighting against the hordes of beast races like a tide.</p><p></p><p>This was naturally Li Fan's orders.</p><p></p><p>Apart from collecting beast cores to be used as raw materials for transforming spiritual energy into the Immortal Spirit Tower.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, it was to let Lin Ling and Tian Yang, in battle, hone their actual combat skills.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang was doing fine.</p><p></p><p>But in the battle with Mo Shi earlier, Lin Ling, as a newly born tree spirit, relied almost entirely on instincts and had a completely blank combat consciousness, which was somewhat inappropriate for her level of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan had Tian Yang take her to train in the world of the beast races during this rare peaceful period.</p><p></p><p>Countless beast races had been slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>Under the baptism of endless fresh blood, on Lin Ling's originally tender and innocent face, there was now a hint of a chilling aura.</p><p></p><p>Her moves became more skillful, and even in her mind, images would occasionally emerge naturally, teaching her how to fight more efficiently.</p><p></p><p>Her actual combat power grew rapidly.</p><p></p><p>They looked towards a distant tall tower.</p>

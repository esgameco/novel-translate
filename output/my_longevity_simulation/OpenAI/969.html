        <h1>Chapter 969</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>At this moment, under the deliberate inducement of Li Fan, it was as if a volcano about to erupt, could burst open at any moment. </p><p></p><p>And at this time, Li Fan also gave them an outlet, a hope. </p><p></p><p>A supreme secret technique that could subdue the elite descendants of the high and mighty clans even without cultivation! </p><p></p><p>"Beyond the various realms, within the vast void, there is a compassionate and supreme immortal of the Red Dust, observing the suffering of all living beings." </p><p></p><p>"Although in purgatory, suppressing endless demons and gods, still caring for all living beings." </p><p></p><p>"Hence, he descended with a secret technique, making everyone equal and providing an opportunity for all to strive..." </p><p></p><p>In a murmured voice, the mysterious veil of the secret technique of "God's Arrival" was unveiled before the cultivators. </p><p></p><p>Amidst skepticism, some people, with the thought of trying it out and not losing anything anyway, practiced for some time. </p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, they truly summoned demonic incarnations that could rival Nascent Soul and Soul Transformation cultivators! </p><p></p><p>Even though it seemed unbelievable, the reality was right in front of them. </p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, they could achieve a leap in strength that they might never have been able to achieve in their lifetime, and how many could resist such temptation? </p><p></p><p>Even though some people knew it might be a trap, they still willingly swallowed this poison. </p><p></p><p>Because in their view, with great power at hand, they could do many things they had previously only dreamed of. </p><p></p><p>But what they did not know, and could not predict was... </p><p></p><p>Once they practiced the God's Arrival technique and summoned their demonic incarnations, their thoughts and desires were no longer under their control. </p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's hint and guidance, the highly talented and ambitious cultivators of Luo Yan Province abandoned their own aspirations for the time being. </p><p></p><p>Quietly leaving Luo Yan Province, they headed towards remote territories they might never have considered visiting before. </p><p></p><p>It seemed like something was waiting for them there. </p><p></p><p>The propagator resided in Luo Yan Province, and the vigilance was at its peak. </p><p></p><p>But under the propagator's instruction not to cause excessive disturbance and to keep a low profile, all defensive measures were targeted. </p><p></p><p>Therefore, Luo Yan Province was not completely sealed off, and the departure of these cultivators was not hindered. </p><p></p><p>Although it was indeed suspicious for so many cultivators to leave within such a short period, in normal circumstances, it would have alerted the Luo Yan Province Immortal Alliance. </p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the propagator was here. </p><p></p><p>What could be more important than treating this important figure with caution? </p><p></p><p>If they failed to treat him well, and angered him, even the most powerful cultivators would not be able to protect themselves, but only seek to survive. </p><p></p><p>Centuries of operation in Luo Yan Province would be instantly destroyed. </p><p></p><p>They could not afford such consequences at all. </p><p></p><p>Thus, treating the propagator well now overshadowed all other matters within Luo Yan Province. </p><p></p><p>As a result, the investigation and handling of the mass departure of these cultivators were temporarily suspended. </p><p></p><p>Once they had all stealthily completed their relocation and dispersed, and the propagator had had his fill, he left without a care. </p><p></p><p>Before leaving, a group of black-robed cultivators, under the pretext of strictly protecting the propagator's whereabouts and secrecy, destroyed some data. </p><p></p><p>When Luo Yan Province had returned to normal chaos, the cultivators of Luo Yan Province did not seem to find anything amiss upon inspection. </p><p></p><p>It seemed no different from the usual Luo Yan Province. </p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Immortal Alliance in Luo Yan Province, who were back on track, had already begun to dream about how they would progress further once they had gained the favor of the propagator. </p><p></p><p>However, they did not know that a terrible catastrophe had already slipped through their hands unintentionally. </p><p></p><p>"It can begin now." </p><p></p><p>Thirty days later, after spreading out from Luo Yan Province, the cultivators had managed to increase the number of bewitched cultivators by an order of magnitude through their efforts. </p><p></p><p>Mouru Bin, who thought it was almost enough, at this moment, contacted Li Fan through his demonic incarnation. </p><p></p><p>And Li Fan, looking at the map of various regions of the Ten Thousand Immortal League spread out before him, with countless red dots on the map, smiled faintly. </p><p></p><p>The sinister ghosts in the sea of consciousness vanished in an instant. </p><p></p><p>All the demons lost their traces, becoming empty and bright. </p><p></p><p>And at that moment, numerous ancient demons, imagined and fabricated by Li Fan, descended upon the Xuanyellow Realm! </p><p></p><p>The cultivators who had practiced the God's Arrival technique had completely lost their ability to think for themselves. </p><p></p><p>They had become mere puppets of powerful demonic entities, acting according to Li Fan's will. </p><p></p><p>Each demon simultaneously launched attacks on the celestial cities in various regions of the Immortal Alliance. </p><p></p><p>Even though it was a rotation every three months now, the defenses of the celestial cities were no match for Li Fan. </p><p></p><p>They invaded the interiors of various celestial cities. </p><p></p><p>Compared to the confrontation between the Five Elders in the Ten Thousand Immortal League, the celestial cities of the various regions were truly peaceful. </p><p></p><p>Even if the Five Elders of the Ten Thousand Immortal League were to battle, it would be limited to a few border regions. For the vast majority of cultivators, the so-called war was only glimpsed through the Tianxuan Mirror. </p><p></p><p>It was quite distant from their actual lives. </p><p></p><p>They had never thought that one day they would be attacked! </p><p></p><p>As the demons breached the defenses and entered the interiors of the celestial cities, the vast majority of the cultivators of the Ten Thousand Immortal League chose to flee rather than confront them head-on. </p><p></p><p>"Ten Thousand Immortal League is your Ten Thousand Immortal League, not mine." </p><p></p><p>That's what almost all the fleeing cultivators thought in their hearts. </p><p></p><p>Only a very few cultivators, with still some hot blood and belonging to the Security Department of the Wuxia Hall, regained their senses and stood up to face the demonic entities head-on. </p><p></p><p>They fought against countless demons. </p><p></p><p>But all these demons were being controlled by Li Fan. </p><p></p><p>Although the division of too many thoughts prevented perfect control over each demon, the huge demonic group formed by absorbing the divine thoughts of many cultivators made it easy to crush the resistors. </p><p></p><p>After all... </p><p></p><p>At that moment, Li Fan was not truly fighting alone. He was controlling the minds and thoughts of hundreds of thousands of cultivators. </p><p></p><p>And with Li Fan's battle consciousness far surpassing that of ordinary cultivators, the general defenses of the Ten Thousand Immortal League soon crumbled and fell one after another. </p><p></p><p>Knowing the existence of the Immortal Relics, Li Fan chose not to kill. Instead, he split into numerous demons and forcefully entered the minds of the Ten Thousand Immortal League cultivators who had lost their ability to resist. </p><p></p><p>They became the nourishment for the bodies of the practitioners practicing the God's Arrival technique. </p><p></p><p>Over time, these bodies that had lost autonomy would involuntarily summon demonic incarnations again. </p><p></p><p>Engaging in battles to sustain battles, continuing to split.</p>

            <p>In every life, one must create a clone of oneself. He had long been accustomed to splitting his mind in two.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, with the birth of this other entity, almost equivalent to a third clone, a completely different feeling surged in Xu Bai's heart.</p><p></p><p>The miraculous and mystical transformation was based on the "Stealing Heaven and Changing Day" technique, further derived from it.</p><p></p><p>It could be said to be the most orthodox technique of creating clones in the immortal cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Whether the main body or the clone, both were completely controlled by his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>In contrast to the "Holy Blood Incarnation" technique.</p><p></p><p>Before the Holy Fetus separated from the mother's body, it did indeed feel like a part of his own body. He could control it as he pleased.</p><p></p><p>However, after he separated from it behind his back, it seemed to undergo a mysterious change.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, another consciousness split from himself, inside the Holy Fetus.</p><p></p><p>And he could still maintain full control of the Holy Fetus.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>There was always a feeling that something was not right.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Fetus turned around, locking eyes with Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>It was as if there was a mirror between the two, one clothed and the other completely naked.</p><p></p><p>From the outside, there was no apparent difference between the two.</p><p></p><p>But after staring at Xu Bai for a long time, there was a constant feeling in his heart that something was off between them.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly remembered a horror movie scene he had seen before crossing over.</p><p></p><p>Late at night, in the bathroom.</p><p></p><p>Having finished washing up, he inadvertently caught sight of his other self in the mirror.</p><p></p><p>To his horror, the reflection of himself in the mirror suddenly revealed a strange smile towards him.</p><p></p><p>Thoughts flashed by in an instant.</p><p></p><p>In reality, there was no event where the Holy Fetus lost control and smiled mysteriously at him.</p><p></p><p>But as he looked at the Holy Fetus before him, a thought suddenly occurred to Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>If his original self, Li Fan, were to fall, there was no doubt that his clone, Xu Bai, would also perish.</p><p></p><p>But what about this Holy Fetus?</p><p></p><p>Would it also die with them?</p><p></p><p>The purpose of the "Holy Blood Incarnation" technique was to ensure the eternal lineage of the imperial family.</p><p></p><p>So the answer was quite obvious. It would not.</p><p></p><p>"This is the fundamental difference between the Holy Fetus and the clone," Xu Bai realized.</p><p></p><p>"What Xiao Qing said is almost the same as having a clone..."</p><p></p><p>"It's just almost."</p><p></p><p>Understanding this, Li Fan, who was in Tianquan Province comprehending the "Boundless Illusory Law," couldn't help but pause his actions.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the journey of his clone in the empire, a strange expression appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"It's interesting. Indeed, it seems inevitable that it has been influenced to some extent."</p><p></p><p>Turning back, looking from the perspective of his original self.</p><p></p><p>The choices of his clone Xu Bai seemed a bit hasty.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these decisions were still made autonomously by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>But in different situations and environments, even the same person might make completely opposite choices.</p><p></p><p>That's what happened with Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>If the original self personally experienced this, faced with the Red String and the "Holy Blood Incarnation," he would undoubtedly first study the Red String.</p><p></p><p>Rather than immediately going for the "Holy Blood Incarnation."</p><p></p><p>Although he did indeed have a plan to use the "Holy Blood Incarnation" to create another clone.</p><p></p><p>But he wouldn't be so eager.</p><p></p><p>He would be more cautious.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who usually thought everything over in an instant, although he still didn't feel any sense of crisis in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He still felt some unease.</p><p></p><p>After weighing for a long time, he couldn't help but have the direct thought of "returning to the truth."</p><p></p><p>"Whether to virtualize the current scene and return to the original anchor point."</p><p></p><p>The surroundings gradually became void as he received the hint to return to the truth.</p><p></p><p>He thought of the yet-to-be-deciphered "Boundless Illusory Law."</p><p></p><p>He thought of the unresolved Disintegration Disc that had not yet been integrated.</p><p></p><p>He thought of not having found a way to completely shield the Tianxuan Treasure Mirror's perception using the End Stone Plate.</p><p></p><p>He thought of not having used the Medicine King Ding, breaking out of the Xuanhuang Realm and exploring the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>He thought of...</p><p></p><p>Leaving was something he truly hesitated over.</p><p></p><p>After a long hesitation, Li Fan, like a withered stone, completely stopped moving.</p><p></p><p>The fierce mental struggle in his mind continued, and Li Fan's body began to tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Whether to virtualize the current scene and return to the original anchor point."</p><p></p><p>The hint to return to the truth echoed again.</p><p></p><p>But to Li Fan, it was no longer pleasant to hear.</p><p></p><p>Humans rely on desires to drive their actions.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, as Li Fan reopened the truth panel for the second time, the desire to "return to the truth" was slightly weaker than before...</p><p></p><p>This time, there was less struggle.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Li Fan still closed the truth panel.</p><p></p><p>Exhaling heavily...</p><p></p><p>It was as if in an instant, he lost all his strength.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slumped directly to the ground, panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, barely supporting his body with both hands, Li Fan's eyes showed emotions he couldn't quite grasp.</p><p></p><p>He began his third attempt.</p><p></p><p>The result was evident.</p><p></p><p>This time, he made decisions even faster.</p><p></p><p>Within just a few breaths, he closed the truth panel.</p><p></p><p>"The Profound Yellow Immortal Heart Mantra..."</p><p></p><p>For the fourth time, Li Fan silently activated the supreme immortal method that had saved him from danger multiple times.</p><p></p><p>But as he activated the Immortal Heart Mantra, at the moment he opened the truth panel...</p><p></p><p>Even before the many things that bound him had a chance to interfere, he voluntarily withdrew.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Heart Mantra was formed by reversing the cultivation way of the heart.</p><p></p><p>And now, as Li Fan desired to return to the truth to avoid disaster.</p><p></p><p>Under the operation of the Immortal Heart Mantra, the thought of returning to the truth instantaneously turned into nourishment for the expanded divine consciousness within him.</p><p></p><p>After another failure, Li Fan stood still in the secret chamber, silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>This time, Li Fan didn't struggle.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he closed his eyes and started to think calmly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan encountered the most dangerous situation since crossing over.</p><p></p><p>Because the layout of this world had been established for a long time and had not yet come to fruition. This led to many emotions of "reluctance."</p><p></p><p>Under the influence of a certain power, these emotions were amplified to the extreme, causing him to autonomously refuse to return to the truth.</p><p></p><p>Even at this moment, Li Fan still believed there was nothing wrong with himself.</p><p></p><p>It was just that he had been a bit too greedy.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan was ultimately mindful of his life.</p><p></p><p>Having a firm belief in longevity, he also realized.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't return to the truth, in this perilous and mysterious Xuanhuang Realm, there would indeed be a risk of falling at any time.</p>

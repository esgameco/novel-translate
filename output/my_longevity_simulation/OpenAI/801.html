        <div class="content">
            <p>Still at the peak of Resolution Mountain!</p><p></p><p>An invisible wave burst out from Li Fan, who was in the middle stage of the Golden Elixir. </p><p></p><p>Although his eyes were still somewhat reddened, the feeling of hunger had indeed weakened significantly!</p><p></p><p>Prepared in advance, Li Fan immediately activated the Profound Yellow Immortal Heart Mantra.</p><p></p><p>Once again, quietly began to resist this deadly hunger.</p><p></p><p>Although the hunger feeling had only weakened slightly, it was a lot more comfortable for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>In the eight years of the previous life, he himself did not know how he persisted.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the blessing of the Profound Yellow Immortal Heart Mantra and his obsession with 【Immortality】, he would have given up long ago and devoured everything in this small world of the Great Mystery completely!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't know what consequences it would bring if he did that.</p><p></p><p>But deep down, he felt that if it were true, his fate might not be any better than the corpse on Immortal Grave.</p><p></p><p>With the torment of eight years of experience, Li Fan in this life was much stronger in dealing with the slightly weakened hunger, able to think about other things while not being able to resist it.</p><p></p><p>"It still won't decrease with the passage of time... It seems I can only rely on 【Resolution】 to reduce its influence," Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>As this time, choosing the inheritance option accelerated the progress.</p><p></p><p>So, after anchoring for four years, the 【Resolution】 was fully charged.</p><p></p><p>With great determination, Li Fan maintained his clear mind while flying to Yi Yin's tomb and absorbing the Dao-transforming stone.</p><p></p><p>Then he activated Resolution.</p><p></p><p>?? Returned to the Resolution Mountain anchoring for a year, this time Li Fan's eyes were no longer red.</p><p></p><p>Even without using the Profound Yellow Immortal Heart Mantra, he could suppress the feeling of hunger just by his own perseverance.</p><p></p><p>"The reduction in effect has increased significantly."</p><p></p><p>"But it still exists."</p><p></p><p>"It seems another round is needed."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but narrow his eyes: "It will take four consecutive Resolutions to completely eliminate the negative effects."</p><p></p><p>"Is this the price of facing a True Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, the corpse Li Fan saw in the Immortal Grave was the legendary True Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, because the other's eyes were open, it was hard to say if they were dead or not.</p><p></p><p>After all, everything Li Fan had experienced showed the terror of the True Immortal. It couldn't be measured by common sense.</p><p></p><p>"It's similar to the 【mark】 left after being swallowed in the Source Dao Prefecture for ten years."</p><p></p><p>"There indeed exists things that can still affect me even after I activate Resolution."</p><p></p><p>But this does not mean that the being reigning over the Source Dao Prefecture or the so-called True Immortals surpass the Resolution.</p><p></p><p>It's just that I am the carrier of Resolution.</p><p></p><p>Because my memories don't disappear during the process of Resolution. So, Resolution is not absolute, nor pure.</p><p></p><p>These negative factors accompany me, allowing them to continue to exist after Resolution.</p><p></p><p>Just like the crystal of the Dao-transforming stone in my mind. Every life doesn't need to be specifically stored, only with my 【Godly Transformation One】, I can bring growth back to the established anchor point.”</p><p></p><p>The same goes for Divine Awareness and Soul.</p><p></p><p>Although the actual growth is cut back after Resolution, this is the fundamental reason why I can continue to grow stronger in each cycle.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suppressed the feeling of hunger with sheer willpower.</p><p></p><p>While thinking slowly.</p><p></p><p>Distracting attention is also extraordinarily effective in overcoming hunger.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the experiences of the previous life, Li Fan was considering the plan for future actions.</p><p></p><p>Witnessing the transmission of the Law.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the power of the True Immortal.</p><p></p><p>With his horizons broadened, Li Fan's strategy must also correspondingly change.</p><p></p><p>Soon, another four years of anchoring passed.</p><p></p><p>Once again absorbing an inferior-grade Dao-transforming stone, making the crystal of the Dao-transforming stone in his mind shine even brighter after that.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan activated Resolution again.</p><p></p><p>When he returned to the peak of Resolution Mountain this time, his body and mind felt normal, with no anomalies.</p><p></p><p>He then activated the Violet Sky Majestic Intent, cleansing his soul.</p><p></p><p>Eliminating all possible hazards.</p><p></p><p>Thus, a whole year passed.</p><p></p><p>On the mountaintop, at the edge of the cliff.</p><p></p><p>Facing the sun rising above the sea of clouds, Li Fan exhaled slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Several Resolutions together took just over ten years."</p><p></p><p>"But I truly feel like it's been a world away. A lot longer than the centuries spent laying the foundation back then."</p><p></p><p>"Hunger..."</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's mind, the extremely complex symbol on the barren ground of the Immortal Grave fleetingly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Not daring to attempt rashly, he could only think about it in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"I once saw a 【chaotic】 character atop a broken stone in the misty abyss."</p><p></p><p>"And there's actually a 【hunger】 symbol on the Immortal Grave."</p><p></p><p>"This hunger symbol may very likely be the ultimate reason why the Immortal Grave keeps attracting external objects."</p><p></p><p>"Is it Immortal Law?"</p><p></p><p>"That's a bit too terrifying."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyelids twitched slightly.</p><p></p><p>After calming his mind, he felt that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>"The 【hunger】 character in the Immortal Grave is a complex symbol. Though I don't understand its meaning, I naturally grasped it the moment I saw it."</p><p></p><p>"While the 【chaotic】 character in the misty abyss is the same font commonly used in the cultivation world."</p><p></p><p>"The 【hunger】 character can thoroughly bring countless cultivators into dire straits."</p><p></p><p>"And the true 【chaotic】 character that I encountered, a mere monster that's not even part of the united Way, can survive..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan realized instantly: "It's not the original 【chaotic】."</p><p></p><p>"But an imitation left behind after Immortal Law 【chaotic】."</p><p></p><p>Having got this answer, Li Fan fell silent in an instant.</p><p></p><p>How truly formidable is the real 【chaotic】 character that can be compared with the 【hunger】 symbol on the Immortal Grave?</p><p></p><p>Even the Immortals are still under the suppression of a mere 【hunger】 character, their fates unknown.</p><p></p><p>End of the Immortal Path.</p><p></p><p>And the unexplained loss of contact in other cultivation worlds.</p><p></p><p>Does all this have something to do with 【chaos】?</p><p></p><p>In a split second, Li Fan plunged into endless contemplation.</p><p></p><p>This time, the harvest was too much.</p><p></p><p>It had even caused an impact on Li Fan beyond his limits.</p><p></p><p>In reality, it was not a good thing.</p><p></p><p>After all, even the Transcendent Law Preceptor, he had no idea how to counteract it.</p><p></p><p>Let alone the True Immortals above the Transcendent Law.</p><p></p><p>"I can't aim too high."</p><p></p><p>"I still need to proceed step by step, come out of the life and death crisis in the Profound Yellow Realm before anything else."</p><p></p><p>A long time passed before Li Fan came to his senses.</p><p></p><p>Feeling somewhat lost, he pondered.</p>

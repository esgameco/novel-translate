        <h1>Chapter 981</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Between the "Medicine King Sect" and the "Heavenly Machinery Sect," on the wide and flat stone square, the air was filled with passion.</p><p></p><p>More than five hundred flesh puppets sat cross-legged, instinctively practicing the "Primordial Life Technique."</p><p></p><p>"You have amazing speed, moving around each province to capture some cultivators. Otherwise, if all these missing cultivators gather in one or two provinces, it will definitely alert the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance," Li Fan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>He casually set up a formation on the square, hiding these flesh puppets while dispersing the heavy smell of blood.</p><p></p><p>"That's not necessarily the case. The defense forces at the grassroots level of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance have not yet recovered so quickly, and many places are still basically unguarded. Moreover, all the cultivators I captured are just foundation building cultivators, and the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance may not really care," Li Qing shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"True, the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance is probably busy building the Eternal Immortal Wall and dealing with the millions of unconscious cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"While the calamity of gods and demons hasn't hurt the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance's core, it has reduced their control over the grassroots to some extent. I'm afraid it won't be long before they have to hold another large-scale recruitment exam," Li Fan said.</p><p></p><p>The main body and the clone were communicating with each other with words.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, on the square, many almost imperceptible sounds appeared.</p><p></p><p>Like the sound of gears moving, it resonated on each flesh puppet. The overlapping sounds eventually merged into a crisp whole sound.</p><p></p><p>"Clang... "</p><p></p><p>The main body and the clone exchanged a glance. "Quite considerate, reaching the threshold and still reminding us actively."</p><p></p><p>"This Spirit Yuan Sovereign is also quite extraordinary," Li Fan couldn't help but appreciate him more, deciding that he must meet him in the next life.</p><p></p><p>"How is it?" Li Fan asked, looking at the clone who was practicing the Primordial Life Technique.</p><p></p><p>In fact, through synchronized perception, he clearly sensed the increase in cultivation in the clone's body due to practicing the Primordial Life Technique.</p><p></p><p>However, he asked in a mischievous manner.</p><p></p><p>"Well, although the growth is slow, I can barely cultivate now," Li Qing analyzed while continuing his practice.</p><p></p><p>"Next, as the number of cultivators practicing the Primordial Life Technique continues to increase, the efficiency of the technique will gradually improve until it reaches a limit," Li Qing continued.</p><p></p><p>"Well, it's time to implement it in the small world," Li Fan nodded.</p><p></p><p>By mass-producing the Heavenly Furnaces, the spiritual energy in the small world would be restored. Then, using the Profound Golden Clear Heart Mantra and accompanying herbs, he would remove the mortal essence within the cultivators. Even though the chances of success were not high, as long as the base was large enough, there was no need to worry about the quantity of cultivators that could be produced. All of them would practice the Primordial Life Technique, mass-producing low-level cultivators.</p><p></p><p>During this process, if extraordinary talents or individuals with outstanding abilities were found, they could be absorbed as official members of the Ten Realms United Association, granting them true techniques.</p><p></p><p>As for the other cultivators with limited utility, they would be sent into the River of Blood to replace each other.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A set of streamlined procedures had been basically established.</p><p></p><p>Although it sounded very simple, Li Fan could only create such a system after encountering various opportunities in the reincarnation cycle.</p><p></p><p>For an ordinary cultivator, they might not be able to find a way to create an unlimited Heavenly Furnace that could generate spiritual energy throughout their entire life.</p><p></p><p>The prototype was completed, and the next step was how to implement it concretely. It was just a step-by-step process, so Li Fan let his clone Li Qing take full responsibility.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the control of all the Heavenly Furnaces was handed over to Li Qing through the Heavenly Ten Thousand Spirit Great Formation.</p><p></p><p>"A Dao Insect may have the risk of mutation, which cannot be ignored. Monitor it at all times, and if there are any changes, handle it immediately," Li Fan said, and then seemed to have a new idea.</p><p></p><p>"Well, if there really is a Dao Insect with a mutation, there's no need to kill them all. Leave some samples of each variation, they might be useful in the future," Li Fan instructed.</p><p></p><p>The clone readily accepted the order.</p><p></p><p>After arranging the affairs, Li Fan finally had some leisure time.</p><p></p><p>All the plans had officially entered the accumulation stage, waiting for the opportunity to manifest.</p><p></p><p>Feeling a bit bored, Li Fan flashed to the outside of the temple where the faceless stone statues were placed.</p><p></p><p>He lightly pointed towards the sky, releasing the long-trapped Yan Fangzhou.</p><p></p><p>Trapped in an empty place, constantly disturbed by the formation, time passed like years for Yan Fangzhou.</p><p></p><p>From Li Fan's observation, this former proud son of heaven seemed to have genuinely gone mad.</p><p></p><p>Unaware of being released, Yan Fangzhou didn't react even when Li Fan waved his hand in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Sending a strand of divine sense into Yan Fangzhou's sea of consciousness, there was no instinctive defense mechanism to external intrusions.</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou's past memories were as if shattered by a knife, completely fragmented.</p><p></p><p>Only occasional storms of fear, helplessness, and pleading thoughts swept through his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Poor child, let me save you," Li Fan smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping his divine sense, he crushed all the remaining thoughts in Yan Fangzhou's mind.</p><p></p><p>Then, like drawing on a blank canvas, he freely fabricated a completely new life for Yan Fangzhou.</p><p></p><p>In the process of contacting the Spirit Wood Realm, he was inadvertently discovered by someone. In order to prevent his identity from being exposed, and to retreat while fighting, he intended to lure the other party into the Spirit Wood Realm to silence them.</p><p></p><p>Although he succeeded, he also suffered severe injuries and fell into a coma.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Mastering the Cloud Water Illusion Technique, and with rich experience in such matters, Li Fan soon implanted all these mixed true and false memories into Yan Fangzhou's mind.</p><p></p><p>After some time, Yan Fangzhou gradually woke up.</p><p></p><p>His brain had been blank for a long time, but with a sudden stabbing pain, scenes flooded in like a tide.</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou looked at Li Fan with a solemn expression, feeling a sense of shame deep in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, I..." Yan Fangzhou started to speak, but Li Fan raised his hand, saying, "Everyone has their moments of mistakes. The important thing is that you came back alive."</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou's heart warmed at Li Fan's words.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivator who discovered your secret has been taken care of."</p><p></p><p>"I haven't been back to the Spirit Wood Realm for a long time, so I'll take this opportunity to visit. Think about how to cover up your disappearance while I'm gone," Li Fan calmly instructed before his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou bowed and then scanned the Spirit Wood Realm with his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>His expression instantly became somewhat confused.</p><p></p><p>"This place... has changed so much since I left. What has happened?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the completely renewed Spirit Wood Realm, Yan Fangzhou felt both surprised and delighted.</p><p></p><p>"Yan Fangzhou! You're awake?!" At this moment, an excited voice echoed from afar.</p><p></p><p>"Shang Tianci?" Yan Fangzhou narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This talented young man, a member of the Mountain and River Garden just like him, had been designed to be kidnapped back to the Spirit Wood Realm and forced to join the Ten Realms United Association.</p><p></p><p>Thinking he was an elder who had joined the association before him, Shang Tianci was unaware of his true status.</p>

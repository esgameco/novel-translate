        <h1>Chapter 784</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The fleeting sense of alertness disappeared in an instant, and when they looked again in that moment.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the person's face was still as enthusiastic as before.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, really. I just didn't expect you Tàiyǎn Sect people to have so many Hédào cultivators. It was just a little startling." Xǔ Bái pretended to look very shocked.</p><p></p><p>"It's indeed a well-known sect from ancient times, with such profound heritage. It's truly unimaginable." Xǔ Bái praised.</p><p></p><p>Flattery is always liked by everyone.</p><p></p><p>As soon as this was said, not only the cultivators leading the way in front.</p><p></p><p>Even the casual onlookers along the road all cast satisfied glances.</p><p></p><p>However, this made Xǔ Bái and Fāng Zàijì confirmed the abnormality of the Tàiyǎn Sect.</p><p></p><p>Because their expressions of "satisfaction" appeared at the same moment!</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Fāng, are you sure we can escape from here?" Xǔ Bái chatted pleasantly with the Tàiyǎn Sect cultivators, while quietly asking Fāng Zàijì.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm working on it. This place is like a prison, the space is very firm. It will take some effort to break free and flee." Fāng Zàijì replied with solemnity.</p><p></p><p>Life and death matters have made the usually carefree Fāng Zàijì finally serious.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be anxious, let's first see what the situation is with this Tàiyǎn Sect." Xǔ Bái reassured.</p><p></p><p>By the time the two of them exchanged their thoughts, they had already been led by the disciples of the Tàiyǎn Sect to the center of the city, in a uniquely shaped building made entirely of blue transparent crystal.</p><p></p><p>The entire structure was made of blue transparent crystals.</p><p></p><p>From the outside, one could clearly see that it was divided into rectangular spaces inside.</p><p></p><p>In each space, there was a cultivator busy working.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Xǔ Bái and Fāng Zàijì exchanged a glance.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go. Senior Brother is waiting inside." The middle-aged cultivator said casually.</p><p></p><p>Similar to entering the Wànxian Alliance's Formation Hall, Xǔ Bái stepped into the blue crystal building and felt as if the space under his feet was moving.</p><p></p><p>The transparency of the surrounding walls gradually decreased, and he could no longer see the appearance of the outside.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the decorations and furnishings inside the space were constantly changing.</p><p></p><p>Only Xǔ Bái and the others stood quietly, without any change.</p><p></p><p>When the crystal walls completely turned into wall-like structures, a phantom blue figure suddenly appeared in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior Brother Chen!"</p><p></p><p>The leading Tàiyǎn Sect disciples all saluted.</p><p></p><p>The blue light gradually solidified, revealing the true appearance of a handsome man.</p><p></p><p>"Chen Tīanhǎi?!" When Fāng Zàijì saw the man's face clearly, he couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>Chen Tīanhǎi looked at Fāng Zàijì, as if his appearance was not surprising. </p><p></p><p>"This time, you all did well on the mission. You can go down first, I have something to discuss with this old friend." He ordered the others.</p><p></p><p>Not knowing what benefits he had obtained, the group of Tàiyǎn Sect cultivators leading the way all smiled happily.</p><p></p><p>They quickly left the space.</p><p></p><p>Fāng Zàijì also calmed down a bit at this time, but the look of shock in his eyes did not fade, constantly scrutinizing Chen Tīanhǎi in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed him in person. I didn't expect him to still be alive..."</p><p></p><p>While muttering to himself, Fāng Zàijì transmitted an explanation to Xǔ Bái: "Chen Tīanhǎi was the first direct disciple of the Tàiyǎn Sect back then, the heir to the next sect master. However, he was stripped of all titles for some reason later on. He even disappeared, and was wanted by the Tàiyǎn Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Back then, when there were Tàiyǎn Sect disciples involved in hunting me down, I couldn't escape. It was this kid who saved me, allowing me to safely hide in the Medicine King Sect."</p><p></p><p>"I heard about his situation at the time, and felt a bit sorry. I didn't expect..."</p><p></p><p>"Seeing me, is it a bit surprising?" At this moment, Chen Tīanhǎi smiled and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Long time no see, you still look the same. No, for us, it's been thousands of years. It's just a moment for your Medicine King Sect."</p><p></p><p>With these words, Chen Tīanhǎi revealed the experiences of the Medicine King Sect going through the Heavenly Ruins and crossing thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>"So, you also know that the Medicine King Sect's attempt to control the Cauldron and escape was a dead end?" Fāng Zàijì squinted his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I only learned about it after the fact. Otherwise, with my temperament at the time, I would've followed you no matter what." Chen Tīanhǎi's answer made Fāng Zàijì slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Follow us?" He couldn't help but be puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"That's the Heavenly Ruins. How many people in the entire Xuanhuang Realm can witness such a wonder and safely return? Brother Fāng, you are one of the very few lucky ones." Chen Tīanhǎi shrugged, praising him.</p><p></p><p>Fāng Zàijì shrugged, "That might disappoint you. Shortly after entering the cauldron, I fell into a deep sleep in the Great Dream Spring-Autumn Formation."</p><p></p><p>Chen Tīanhǎi nodded slightly, "That's something you would do. Brother Fāng, you are truly carefree."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Xǔ Bái suddenly interjected, "Are you very interested in the Heavenly Ruins? In fact, we have recorded the experiences of that year."</p><p></p><p>"Beyond expectations..."</p><p></p><p>He whispered, but his eyes flashed with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Sure enough, this variable came from the Medicine King Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Old Chen, what are you muttering in your mouth?" Fāng Zàijì was confused about Chen Tīanhǎi's words.</p><p></p><p>"Fāng, who is this? You haven't introduced me yet." Chen Tīanhǎi asked.</p><p></p><p>"Ah! This is..." Fāng Zàijì looked at Xǔ Bái.</p><p></p><p>After receiving a signal from Xǔ Bái's eyes, he truthfully said, "This is our current sect master of the Medicine King Sect! Xǔ Bái!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" A hint of surprise flashed in Chen Tīanhǎi's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Then, he stared at Xǔ Bái again, seemingly stunned like a statue.</p><p></p><p>It was only after Fāng Zàijì repeatedly called out that he finally regained his senses.</p><p></p><p>His interest in Xǔ Bái seemed to deepen.</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master of the Medicine King Sect actually wants to join our Tàiyǎn Sect. You really don't have good intentions." Chen Tīanhǎi shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Now, the Wànxian Alliance aims to sweep the Xuanhuang Realm. Whether it's the Medicine King Sect or the Tàiyǎn Sect, they will all eventually be brought under the alliance. Everyone will be part of the alliance, and there won't be any distinction between sects. Truly speaking, if the benefits you offer are substantial enough, I may indeed join your Tàiyǎn Sect." Xǔ Bái said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Chen Tīanhǎi was momentarily speechless.</p><p></p><p>"You're not wrong. The era of belonging to sects is over." He said somewhat sadly.</p><p></p><p>"But if you join our Tàiyǎn Sect..." Chen Tīanhǎi's movements stopped for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then he shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Let's forget it. We can't accommodate someone like you."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the price of joining us..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps you wouldn't be willing to accept." Chen Tīanhǎi said mysteriously.</p>

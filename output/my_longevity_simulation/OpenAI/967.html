        <h1>Chapter 967</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>But what made him extremely uncomfortable was that Li Fan stopped abruptly in the middle of his words.</p><p></p><p>The other party's expression suddenly became extremely confused, eyes empty.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, there was a little light, instinctively looking around.</p><p></p><p>"You are..." Li Fan stared at the ink scholar Bin in front of him, asking in confusion.</p><p></p><p>The stark contrast between before and after made Ink Scholar Bin take a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Although he knew that Sun Xingwang's cultivated technique was extremely bizarre, being one of the Twelve Demon Kings.</p><p></p><p>But when things got this strange, it still made him feel a bit horrified.</p><p></p><p>"But it seems Xingwang is thinking along the same lines as me."</p><p></p><p>"Yes... it turns out he intentionally led the one transmitting the law, Feng, to my dormant place. It was to have me infiltrate the Wuxian Alliance."</p><p></p><p>As Ink Scholar Bin was lost in thought, Li Fan seemed to have recognized him.</p><p></p><p>"So it's you, Brother Bin."</p><p></p><p>"How did we end up here?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked around.</p><p></p><p>Ink Scholar Bin sighed softly, feeling relieved that at least Li Fan remembered him, saving him the effort of explaining further.</p><p></p><p>He then briefly introduced himself to Li Fan as the one who replaced the law transmitter Feng, entered the upper level of the Wuxian Alliance, and schemed for the Xuantian Treasure Mirror. New 69 Book -> 69shuhuix</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Treasure Mirror was the only heavenly treasure refined by the Xuantian King back then. Although it has been used by the Wuxian Alliance over the years, from my observations, the Wuxian Alliance has not fully obtained its control. Instead, they have reached some form of cooperation."</p><p></p><p>"As long as we can regain control of the Xuantian Treasure Mirror, it is very likely that we can determine the whereabouts of the Xuantian King."</p><p></p><p>Seizing the opportunity while Li Fan was still awake, Ink Scholar Bin succinctly stated.</p><p></p><p>"My current state makes this knowledge useless. What do you need me to do?" Li Fan was very cooperative and self-aware.</p><p></p><p>Ink Scholar Bin was very pleased and whispered, "Currently, in the Wuxian Alliance, the Law Transmitter Lineage and the Mirror Holder Lineage stand separately, mutually restraining each other. In addition, there is the Illusionary True Sage Lineage hidden in the dark, serving as a balance."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned slightly, "The top level of the Wuxian Alliance is actually this complicated? And what are Mirror Holders, Illusionary True Sages..."</p><p></p><p>"I have never heard of them before."</p><p></p><p>Ink Scholar Bin nodded slightly, "I also only knew about this after taking over Feng the law transmitter's body. These three lineages seldom show themselves, so it's normal for the outside world not to know the truth about them."</p><p></p><p>"The so-called Law Transmitters are the practitioners who followed behind the Law Transmitting Heavenly Venerable, spreading the new laws that still exist to this day."</p><p></p><p>"And the Mirror Holders, as the name suggests, control the power of the Xuantian Treasure Mirror. Over the years, the Wuxian Alliance has always had the intention of fully possessing the Xuantian Treasure Mirror. Relying on the methods left behind by the Law Transmitting Heavenly Venerable, they have been eroding and increasing their control over the Xuantian Treasure Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"As for the most mysterious third lineage, the Illusionary True Sages..."</p><p></p><p>"I haven't had much contact with them in this period. But it seems to be related to the creation called Epoch and the Beast Clan's Emperor San Mole. With the help of the supreme deduction power and some extraordinary realistic power, they can summon countless powerful practitioners for battle out of thin air..."</p><p></p><p>Ink Scholar Bin shared the current known information with Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After listening to it, Li Fan impatiently waved his hand, "What is the plan?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that even as a law transmitter, seeking the Xuantian Treasure Mirror is not an easy task."</p><p></p><p>Ink Scholar Bin nodded without denying it, "But my plan has been successful so far."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Treasure Mirror has its own intelligence. Since it is not easy to control it, we will force it to cooperate with us actively."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xingwang, you previously passed the Xuantian Spirit Sealing Array through some means to the inside of the Alliance. With my help, the Law Transmitter Lineage is now stirring restlessly, trying to fully control the Tianxuan Mirror through the power of the Xuantian Spirit Sealing Array..."</p><p></p><p>"But we both know that the Xuantian Spirit Sealing Array is just a means of forcing the Xuantian Treasure Mirror to execute certain commands. To truly fully control the Xuantian Treasure Mirror..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I believe other than the Xuantian King, no one else in the world can do it!"</p><p></p><p>"But as we control it in this way, the Xuantian Treasure Mirror is naturally unwilling. As the restraints deepen, we can try to make contact with it. Turn the tables and cooperate with it to help it out of the crisis. The price is to help us find the Xuantian King."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if it refuses..."</p><p></p><p>Ink Scholar Bin's eyes flickered, "We can let the Xuantian Spirit Sealing Array advance further."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan interrupted Ink Scholar Bin, "The Xuantian Treasure Mirror's attitude is uncertain. It probably won't be very eager to help find the Xuantian King, maybe even obstructing..."</p><p></p><p>Ink Scholar Bin smiled, "Brother Xingwang, you forgot, the Xuantian Treasure Mirror was refined by the Xuantian King and is infused with the Xuantian's principles. It cannot speak falsely and must act accordingly."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted his eyes, "Is that so..."</p><p></p><p>Looking confused, as if there were hints of lost memories again.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Ink Scholar Bin quickly changed the subject, "So what you need to do now is to cooperate with me inside and out, gradually increasing my prestige."</p><p></p><p>"Gain the trust of most law transmitters, so we can continue to advance the Xuantian Spirit Sealing Array."</p><p></p><p>"Your Divine Embodiment, within half a month, should expand as much as possible at the fastest pace. When it causes panic, I will take action. Then you cooperate with me and stage a play. By then, destroy most of the Divine Embodiments and keep a small part for backup."</p><p></p><p>Ink Scholar Bin gave instructions.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded repeatedly and immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, your condition..." Ink Scholar Bin looked worried.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the faceless True Immortal Stone Statue appeared in the sky again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared at the stone statue, closed his eyes in thought.</p><p></p><p>A faint golden light appeared again, enveloping the entire body of the stone statue.</p><p></p><p>Then Li Fan opened his eyes and made the stone statue disappear.</p><p></p><p>"It can only be this way."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said placidly.</p><p></p><p>Ink Scholar Bin seemed pensive but didn't continue on that topic.</p><p></p><p>"Our plan is almost foolproof, the only thing to worry about is..."</p><p></p><p>Ink Scholar Bin paused and then said, "That law transmitter Jiang."</p><p></p><p>A rare solemn expression appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"If anyone in the current Wuxian Alliance can truly bear the mantle of reviving the alliance, it would be no other than this person."</p><p></p><p>"Law Transmitter Jiang..."</p><p></p><p>"Truly carries some of the elegance of the Xuantian King in the past."</p><p></p><p>Ink Scholar Bin gave the person a very high evaluation.</p><p></p><p>"Law Transmitter Jiang..." Li Fan's heart stirred but did not inquire further.</p><p></p><p>He pretended to be indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"With you in charge, I am at ease. I'll just cooperate with you from the shadows."</p>

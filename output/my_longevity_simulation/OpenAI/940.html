            <p>But the spy organization of the Five Elders Association also seems to have been significantly affected.新69book→69shuix. com</p><p></p><p>No one came to meet her.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing had no choice but to continue deeper until she arrived at a place called Fan Qingzhou, where she finally received a response.</p><p></p><p>However, after the communication was connected on the other end, there was no response.</p><p></p><p>They just waited for Li Qing to speak first.</p><p></p><p>"I am a member of the Multiverse Alliance, and I have urgent matters that require me to contact your superiors," Li Qing transmitted.</p><p></p><p>"The Multiverse Alliance? What is that?" a voice, sounding as if awoken from a dream, came from the other end.</p><p></p><p>The voice sounded very young.</p><p></p><p>After a brief commotion, the person on the other end soon transformed into a calm middle-aged cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, forgive us, but chaos reigns everywhere now. Many key figures in the organization have disappeared in the great battle, their fates unknown. Therefore, we cannot currently confirm your identity..." </p><p></p><p>He directly rejected Li Qing's request for a meeting.</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, Li Qing spoke, "The more critical the moment, the more crucial the intelligence needed. The information I possess is enough to turn the tide for the Five Elders Association..."</p><p></p><p>"A great achievement, are you willing to miss out on it for nothing? With vacancies in positions now, if you can achieve merit..." </p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Ten Thousand Immortals League now has an absolute advantage. Are you still worried that I might be a spy sent by them?" </p><p></p><p>Li Qing's tone was full of sarcasm and with just a few sentences, she directly broke through the other party's psychological defenses.新69book69shuix. com</p><p></p><p>The breathing on the other end became hurried.</p><p></p><p>However, the communication was temporarily interrupted.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing was not in a hurry but rather patiently waited with confidence.</p><p></p><p>As expected, after a short wait, the middle-aged cultivator took the initiative to establish contact.</p><p></p><p>"Where shall we meet?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's get this straight, I've come here on my own. If the information you provide is unreliable, I'll just pretend that I never met you."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing smiled slightly and revealed her location to the other party.</p><p></p><p>Before long, a black streak of light flew from the sky.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator, completely enveloped in metal armor and with an indiscernible appearance, quietly appeared in front of Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>"That outfit is not bad," Li Qing commented.</p><p></p><p>The armor worn by the middle-aged cultivator was exactly the same as the equipment worn by the cultivators who flew out of the floating city in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"It's only at this time that the Wanderer's Paradise is willing to bring out these good things," the middle-aged cultivator replied shortly, sounding full of complaints.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, an invisible ripple surged from his battle armor.</p><p></p><p>Spreading outwards, it formed a circular barrier, enveloping the two inside.</p><p></p><p>Isolating the interior from the exterior, the scene outside the barrier immediately became blurry.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, it's safe here. "oɔ xnɥs69"book69,69hello, what important information do you have to share?" the middle-aged man asked nervously, staring at Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing smiled and said, "As I've said, it's heavyweight intelligence that can turn the tide of the war. How can I just tell you so easily?"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged cultivator became somewhat anxious, "What do you want then?"</p><p></p><p>"At the very least, I need to speak to someone who has decision-making power before I divulge the information," Li Qing asserted firmly.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't speak, how do I know if you're lying? In such a sensitive moment, should I bring an unknown person like you to meet my superiors? Have I gone insane?" The middle-aged cultivator across from her seemed clearly unsuited for handling intelligence and spy work, displaying little diplomatic naivety.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Qing didn't want to continue interacting with this person, stating directly, "We, the Multiverse Alliance, know how to decipher the Heavenly Venerable Law of the Ten Thousand Immortals League. What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>"What?" The middle-aged cultivator was first stunned, then blurted out in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Is that true?" his voice trembled.</p><p></p><p>"I am here. Let the one who can speak come forward," Li Qing said coldly.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, the middle-aged cultivator finally bit the bullet.</p><p></p><p>With no apparent mental fluctuations, he completed the notification.</p><p></p><p>Before this heavyweight information, the Five Elders Association finally demonstrated a hint of the efficiency it should have had naturally.</p><p></p><p>Within a short span of time, over a hundred streaks of black light flew in unison to their location.</p><p></p><p>They were all wearing metal battle armor and surrounded Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>Leading them was unexpectedly a female cultivator, who walked directly in front of Li Qing. "A fellow daoist from the Multiverse Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing nodded, confirming her identity.</p><p></p><p>"I am Qingyang, in charge of rebuilding the post-war intelligence system. Follow me."</p><p></p><p>She remained composed throughout.</p><p></p><p>Her demeanor indeed earned quite a bit of respect from the members of the Five Elders Association.</p><p></p><p>This underground fortress they were in seemed to have been newly constructed to counter the attacks from the Ten Thousand Immortals League.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the deepest chamber, she ordered the others out, leaving Qingyang alone to face Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>"If you have something to say, you can say it now." Qingyang's voice lacked any emotion.</p><p></p><p>"Qingyang, you dare not reveal your face, it's hard for me to believe," Li Qing chuckled and shook her head.</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, the black metal armor fell away, revealing Qingyang's original appearance.</p><p></p><p>Her appearance was not outstanding, practically unnoticeable in a crowd.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Qing keenly noticed the indifference in her eyes towards life.</p><p></p><p>After carefully scrutinizing her for a while, Li Qing slowly spoke, "Exchange the information from the Chosen Immortal for what we want."</p><p></p><p>"Agreed," Qingyang nodded.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want?" Qingyang asked decisively.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is the Immortal League's treasure, the secret the Immortal League desires?" </p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Surprised by the question, Qingyang was taken aback on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"I...I don't know. But this shouldn't be a classified matter. I will ask," the metal light once again obscured Qingyang's face.</p><p></p><p>When she revealed her face again, it was filled with uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>"The information is beyond my clearance level..."</p><p></p><p>Now she was somewhat unsettled.</p><p></p><p>"Sorry, please wait a moment." Qingyang hurriedly left the secret room.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing, on the other hand, plunged into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, what appears to be the Immortal League's lost treasure seems to be real."</p><p></p><p>"In the past, the Ten Thousand Immortals League besieged the Immortal Union and seemed to extract the remains of the first-generation followers for something.</p>

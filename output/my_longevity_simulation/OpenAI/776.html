        <h1>Chapter 776</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Accompanying the group of cultivators returning was also a joint Dao cultivator from the Taiyan Sect.</p><p></p><p>As a representative of the Taiyan Sect, this person visited the Qingjing Tiancheng and publicly raised a question.</p><p></p><p>Does the Taiyan Sect want the entire sect to join the Wanxian Alliance?</p><p></p><p>Although the Lord of Qingjing City, Meng Shufu, was also a Dao cultivator, he did not dare to make a decision on his own regarding this matter.</p><p></p><p>After temporarily comforting the other party, he hurriedly went to the headquarters of the Wanxian Alliance in person to report the situation.</p><p></p><p>The Dao cultivator from the Taiyan Sect, however, appeared calm and composed, showing no signs of nervousness whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as though he had long been aware of the outcome of Meng Shufu's visit.</p><p></p><p>As expected, not long after, an official announcement was made by the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>In order to further expedite the unification of the Xuanhuang realm, as well as to reduce unnecessary casualties among cultivators and alleviate the burden on the Bureau of Reincarnation, various forces and sects from small worlds were welcomed to merge into the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Those who voluntarily assimilated would not be expelled from their current residences by the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>They only needed to cooperate to complete the "Watch the Heavens and Recognize the Earth" work of the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, in terms of resource cultivation techniques and support, the Wanxian Alliance also provided additional preferential treatment.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, cultivators who successfully persuaded the forces of Dongtian small worlds to submit could still receive corresponding meritorious rewards.</p><p></p><p>After the announcement, many cultivators around the world suddenly became lively and active in their thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Fighting was not an option, but carrying the banner of the Wanxian Alliance, coupled with such favorable conditions to persuade others to surrender, wasn't it easy?</p><p></p><p>Thus, those cultivators who had been slackening in their efforts were once again spurred into action.</p><p></p><p>Within Qingjing Prefecture, Meng Shufu looked at the Dao cultivator from the Taiyan Sect across from him, feeling a sudden realization.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the other party had never shown any worry from start to finish.</p><p></p><p>The Taiyan Sect, renowned for its divination skills since ancient times, must have already calculated the result of their surrender!</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, ancient cultivators are not to be underestimated," Meng Shufu thought to himself. He politely led the Dao cultivator from the Taiyan Sect into the Wanxian Alliance headquarters to discuss the specific matters of assimilation.</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>A piece of news spread like wildfire.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, the Sect Leader of the Taiyan Sect had predicted the imminent unification of the Xuanhuang realm under the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>After discussions, the sect reached a consensus and decided to go with the flow of the times, ceasing any meaningless resistance.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Leader had personally come to negotiate.</p><p></p><p>From that day on, the Taiyan Sect officially joined the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>This was also the first small world force to voluntarily surrender and be accepted.</p><p></p><p>The news stirred up the cultivators of the Wanxian Alliance inexplicably.</p><p></p><p>After all, the name of the Taiyan Sect, even for scattered cultivators, had been heard of.</p><p></p><p>Now that they had voluntarily surrendered to the Wanxian Alliance, it seemed that the day of unifying the Xuanhuang realm was truly not far off.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators suddenly felt a bit nervous and vowed to seize this last opportunity to earn merit.</p><p></p><p>In Changsheng Valley,</p><p></p><p>"I asked my disciples to inquire about the ancient sects. They all said that the Taiyan Sect had long been destroyed during the great calamity."</p><p></p><p>"But I didn't expect them to be alive and well." Liu San sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the Taiyan Sect's divination skills are unparalleled. How could they not be prepared for the arrival of the great calamity."</p><p></p><p>"However, they have set aside their past pride and voluntarily surrendered to the Wanxian Alliance. This is somewhat beyond my expectations. According to their temperament back then, they would probably not accept that more than half of their cultivators died."</p><p></p><p>Liu San's tone was not polite at all, showing his lack of favor toward the Taiyan Sect.</p><p></p><p>"The overall situation is hard to resist. Comparing face with one's own life, it is simply not worth mentioning." Fang Zaiji said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"This is actually an opportunity for us. After surrendering to the Wanxian Alliance, we can see what treatment we receive. If the Alliance can indeed provide support for cultivation techniques, then there is no need to worry about conflicts due to incompatible laws." Xu Bai suddenly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Liu San, Fang Zaiji, and Jiang Yushan all stared at Xu Bai directly, seemingly surprised by his words.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai didn't mind and continued, "Liu Lao, you have always wanted to let the other elders and disciples from the Medicine King Sect out from the Medicine King Cauldron. If the Wanxian Alliance can provide support for cultivation techniques, then there's no need to worry about them killing each other due to incompatible laws."</p><p></p><p>"We have kept them in the Great Dream Spring and Autumn Array for so long, which is also not ideal." Xu Bai's tone was quite relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Liu San opened his mouth slightly but stopped inexplicably.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he hesitated and said, "Isn't this decision a bit hasty?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai waved his hand, "Lao Liu, you're overthinking it. The Taiyan Sect is adept at divination. If surrendering truly harmed them, they would not have acted this way."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the sooner you choose to join the Wanxian Alliance, the more benefits you are likely to receive. After all, the Wanxian Alliance needs to set a good example for the remaining small worlds. If they say one thing and do another, it will backfire, triggering a backlash from the small worlds."</p><p></p><p>"For the current Wanxian Alliance, unifying the Xuanhuang realm and upgrading the Tianxuan Mirror are top priorities. A few resources and cultivation techniques are insignificant."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's explanation was detailed and the reasoning was quite sufficient. Liu San was momentarily unable to refute.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, surrendering is good. I've been thinking about saying this for a long time, but I was afraid you, Sect Master, would blame me, so I didn't mention it." Fang Zaiji said cheerfully, showing strong support for Xu Bai's suggestion.</p><p></p><p>"Lao Fang, I've long wanted to visit the Wanxian Alliance. I heard that their techniques for refining tools have improved significantly since our time. I really want to see it with my own eyes."</p><p></p><p>"Yushan, aren't you looking to challenge that woman again? You can openly challenge her in the future."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan remained silent.</p><p></p><p>She was not originally a disciple of the Medicine King Sect, but she stayed within the sect to suppress the erratic aura of the Undying Prison. She didn't have much attachment to the Medicine King Sect. Therefore, she didn't have any objections to Xu Bai's decision.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Liu San sighed silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he looked at Xu Bai, feeling doubts rising in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"All right. Let's set this matter for now. After the complete assimilation of the Taiyan Sect, we will personally visit and see if the Alliance's promises are true."</p><p></p><p>"That day shouldn't be too far away," Xu Bai said with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Mr. Fang, how's your research on the End Stone Disk?" he suddenly changed the topic.</p><p></p><p>The original smile on Fang Zaiji's face froze instantly.</p><p></p><p>He immediately looked at Liu San, "Lao Liu, how are those youngsters doing? Has anyone succeeded in building the foundation with my guidance?"</p><p></p><p>"If you haven't succeeded on your end, I can't proceed with my research either."</p>

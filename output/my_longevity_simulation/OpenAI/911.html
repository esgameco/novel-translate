        <h1>Chapter 911</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Soon he started the "Limitless Yin and Yang Technique", attempting to repair the damage in his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, the so-called "inexhaustible power, eternal soul" Limitless Yin and Yang Technique lost its repair effectiveness when faced with this decaying divine soul!</p><p></p><p>Sensing the hint of darkness in his divine soul, seemingly spreading, Li Fan's heart sank, decisively choosing to cut off the rotten part.</p><p></p><p>As if his head was hit hard with a big hammer, Li Fan suddenly saw stars and felt dizzy.</p><p></p><p>His face turned slightly pale, and in just a moment, the nourishing effect of the Limitless Yin and Yang Technique on the divine soul for at least half a year was wiped out!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately understood what had happened to him.</p><p></p><p>If the intensity of the divine soul were quantified into specific values, then all the previous damage to his divine soul that Li Fan had encountered merely temporarily reduced that value. After using the Limitless Yin and Yang Technique, the value would return to its peak.</p><p></p><p>But this unknown decay of the divine soul was directly affecting the upper limit of the intensity of the divine soul!</p><p></p><p>Even if the Limitless Yin and Yang Technique could repair it, the upper limit being cut off out of nowhere was beyond help!</p><p></p><p>A hint of dangerous light flashed in Li Fan's eyes. His figure flickered, subconsciously moving away from the drunken Han Zhong in front of him.</p><p></p><p>As if completely unaware of what had happened, the drunkard Han Zhong continued to ramble on.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the urge to kill in his heart, Li Fan's gaze flickered, and a waterfall suddenly appeared above Han Zhong's head.</p><p></p><p>Splash!</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, a continuous stream of water poured onto Han Zhong. </p><p></p><p>"Huh? Huh!"</p><p></p><p>Han Zhong was truly very drunk. After being rinsed by the water for a long time, he slowly regained consciousness.</p><p></p><p>He looked bewilderedly at the water column in the sky, full of confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Awake?" Soon, Li Fan's cold voice reached his ears.</p><p></p><p>Han Zhong only then realized that there was an unexpected visitor in his room.</p><p></p><p>As he reached out to try to stop the water flow, he slowly got up.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you…"</p><p></p><p>"Who I am is not important. What is important is that I am very interested in your experience," Li Fan continued to assess Han Zhong.</p><p></p><p>Han Zhong's expression turned somewhat strange upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, it was a rather strange experience I had…" he paused.</p><p></p><p>"Quite a strange experience. I have told others about it, but no one believed me. I even reported it to the Immortal Alliance, but it all ended in vain. If you are really interested, I can tell you again," Han Zhong expressed hesitantly, and upon receiving Li Fan's nod of approval, he hesitated for a moment, seemingly organizing his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Then he slowly continued, "I don't know how many years ago, I did something foolish…"</p><p></p><p>But he was immediately interrupted by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean, 'I don't know how many years ago'?" Li Fan looked at the Jin Dan cultivator before him, his brows slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Han Zhong smiled bitterly, "Because I really don't know how long it has been since I left the Yellow Realm and returned. The people I knew have all passed away, and even my Immortal Alliance identity has been erased because too much time has passed."</p><p></p><p>"Even the Tianxuan Mirror no longer recognizes me. All the contributions I made back then have disappeared."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the phrase "left the Yellow Realm," Li Fan's heart skipped a beat. The subsequent "returned" confirmed that the culprit behind the abnormal spatial fluctuation was Han Zhong.</p><p></p><p>This piqued Li Fan's curiosity about the other's experience.</p><p></p><p>"Please continue," Li Fan urged.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Li Fan was not mocking him, Han Zhong's spirits lifted slightly.</p><p></p><p>He reached for the wine jug beside him and took a sip before saying, "When I was young and reckless, I was skeptical of all authority."</p><p></p><p>"When I traveled to Jiushan Prefecture and was amazed by the spectacle of the Nine Mountains sprawling across and the prohibition against flying for cultivators, I heard that using teleportation arrays in Jiushan Prefecture had great risks…"</p><p></p><p>"At that time, I don't know what I was thinking, but I wanted to try it anyway."</p><p></p><p>Han Zhong sighed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes squinted as he instantly recalled something.</p><p></p><p>When he initially looked up information about Jiushan Prefecture, he had come across a rare piece of information.</p><p></p><p>The individual was directly sent outside the Yellow Realm and never returned.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the unlucky fellow who was said to have been sent outside the Yellow Realm?" Li Fan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Han Zhong did not expect this senior to have heard of his story, causing him to blush.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, Senior. I did something foolish back then because of my recklessness."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's interest grew even more at this point, "After leaving the Yellow Realm, where did you go? What did you see?"</p><p></p><p>A hint of fear and confusion flitted through Han Zhong's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"In fact…"</p><p></p><p>"I am not entirely sure of my whereabouts after leaving the Yellow Realm. It felt like I was enveloped by an invisible bubble, wandering and floating in endless darkness."</p><p></p><p>"Most of the time outside was forever black. But occasionally, there were some distorted scenes flashing by."</p><p></p><p>"However…"</p><p></p><p>Han Zhong shuddered, "I was almost driven insane at that time. So, I am not sure if what I saw was a mirage."</p><p></p><p>"So what did you actually see?" Li Fan's tone was starting to show impatience.</p><p></p><p>"I saw…" Han Zhong fell silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The expression on his face seemed to indicate that he was undergoing considerable inner turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Then, he lowered his voice, trembling, "I seemed to have seen Patriarch Transference."</p><p></p><p>With that, he used the Water Mirror Art to display the scene he had witnessed.</p><p></p><p>On the circular light curtain was an endless darkness.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a golden light flashed, standing out vividly against the dark.</p><p></p><p>As it drew closer, the golden light faintly revealed a figure.</p><p></p><p>With white hair and flowing long beard, a solemn expression exuded an aura of awe-inspiring might.</p><p></p><p>This person's appearance was one that should be known in the Yellow Realm and the Ten Immortal Alliances!</p><p></p><p>It was precisely the same as the statues of Patriarch Transference erected in each floating celestial city!</p><p></p><p>"He… should be Patriarch Transference?" Han Zhong asked uncertainly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared at the scene on the light curtain and slowly nodded his head.</p><p></p><p>What truly caught his attention...</p><p></p><p>Was what was behind Patriarch Transference.</p><p></p><p>Patriarch Transference was racing through the boundless void, with several golden chains extending from his body.</p>

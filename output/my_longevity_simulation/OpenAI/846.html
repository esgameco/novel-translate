        <h1>Chapter 846</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>It's not just a sea of clouds.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the Alliance of Immortals, there are secretly circulating albums of Senior Sister Zhao.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators all have their own pride.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, they wouldnâ€™t go around announcing that they sneakily browsed through the albums.</p><p></p><p>But the contents of these albums are truly fascinating.</p><p></p><p>After viewing them, even those with strong wills would be lost in thought and restless.</p><p></p><p>Even when seeking release from their desires by venting to other cultivators, the cravings remain unsatisfied.</p><p></p><p>They only want to see more of Senior Sister Zhao's art books.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, there would always be more explicit and realistic corresponding albums appearing in secret.</p><p></p><p>Through gentle persuasion, tempting the cultivators, step by step leading them into the abyss.</p><p></p><p>The key point is the perfect timing chosen for this.</p><p></p><p>The Alliance of Immortals' attention from top to bottom is focused on the grand entrance exam.</p><p></p><p>They are completely unaware that, silently and unnoticed in a corner, a very dangerous thing is quietly circulating within the Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Are they so impatient that they have started probing?"</p><p></p><p>"Are they aware that the method has left the Xuanyellow Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli looked puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Even the means of the Heavenly Sovereign of Eternal Life, despite being weaker in the realm of eternal life, are still overwhelming for ordinary cultivators. It is extremely difficult to defend against.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Harmonious Path realm, it falls within this "ordinary" scope.</p><p></p><p>So when He Zhenghao fell under the spell, Li Fan was not the least surprised.</p><p></p><p>Even though he cherished his wife and children, after witnessing Senior Sister Zhao's scandalous acts, he was directly ensnared.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that even though He Daoyou is no longer comparable in Li Fan's eyes, He Zhenghao has already become one of the outstanding cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Without power or influence, he relies solely on his own efforts. Despite being suppressed, he can still become a guardian of an island and make significant progress in the formation technique, able to have a lively chat with the various formation masters at the Tactics Hall...</p><p></p><p>How many cultivators under the heavens are not as good as him!</p><p></p><p>But in the face of Senior Sister Zhao's albums, even He Zhenghao succumbed. One can only imagine the behavior of other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"This is something a hundred times more dangerous than the Immortal Ascension Pill."</p><p></p><p>"The Alliance of Immortals is actually allowing its dissemination without the slightest awareness."</p><p></p><p>"Should I remind them..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli was somewhat hesitant.</p><p></p><p>Even though he wanted to witness the Alliance of Immortals' disastrous defeat and expose their final trump card.</p><p></p><p>However, facing the means of the Heavenly Sovereign of Eternal Life, he still had some fear deep down.</p><p></p><p>"The Alliance of Immortals should have its own way of dealing with it. I don't need to worry."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Ji Shaoli ultimately gave up his plan to interfere and chose to observe from the sidelines.</p><p></p><p>He only cautioned the cultivators within the Mutual Help Society not to indulge their curiosity by peeking at any albums.</p><p></p><p>Simultaneously, he closely monitored the subtle changes happening in secret.</p><p></p><p>However, soon Ji Shaoli realized that he had underestimated the abilities of the Heavenly Sovereign of Eternal Life.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, curiosity killed the cat.</p><p></p><p>Just knowing the danger doesn't completely extinguish the desire.</p><p></p><p>And precisely because they knew the true identity of the protagonist of the albums in advance, a top powerhouse of the Xuanyellow Realm and a ruling Heavenly Sovereign of the Five Elders Society...</p><p></p><p>They became even more curious about the content of the albums.</p><p></p><p>Simultaneously, there was a hint of luck and confidence in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Just one glance shouldn't be a big deal, right...</p><p></p><p>Once such a thought arose, it became difficult to dispel and only grew stronger with time.</p><p></p><p>It clouded their minds.</p><p></p><p>After their desires weren't satisfied, they secretly obtained the albums and began to examine them.</p><p></p><p>While Ji Shaoli was shocked, he had no choice but to lock them all in the dark rooms and supervise their minds.</p><p></p><p>"It's truly impossible to guard against."</p><p></p><p>Listening to the voices filled with resentment and cursing emanating from the darkness, along with their frenzied behaviors, Ji Shaoli's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>"This is just the beginning, and I immediately cut off the influence."</p><p></p><p>"And for those cultivators who are deeply trapped..."</p><p></p><p>A chill ran through Ji Shaoli's heart.</p><p></p><p>"While Senior Sister Zhao may be slightly weaker in actual combat, her impact on cultivators is truly unmatched by any Heavenly Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>To prevent more members of the Mutual Help Society from falling, Ji Shaoli promptly recalled them.</p><p></p><p>He once again sealed off Haixuan Island.</p><p></p><p>"There's still some time before the grand entrance exam. I don't believe the Alliance of Immortals is unaware of this."</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how they handle it."</p><p></p><p>Just as Ji Shaoli expected, when more and more cultivators were influenced by Senior Sister Zhao's albums, the Alliance of Immortals eventually caught wind of some clues.</p><p></p><p>The measures taken by the Alliance of Immortals certainly taught Ji Shaoli a lesson.</p><p></p><p>There was no grand announcement to ban the circulation of the albums.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the authorities didn't even mention the existence of the albums at all.</p><p></p><p>However, almost overnight, thousands of different secret texts suddenly started circulating within the Alliance of Immortals.</p><p></p><p>All those that were previously banned and prohibited from trading were now in circulation.</p><p></p><p>Including the "Theft of the Primordial True Scripture by Celestial Stealing Lord," which Li Fan had seen before.</p><p></p><p>As well as "Devouring Father, Eating Mother, Demon Infant, Forgetful Transmission," and "Scholar Casually Opens River, Flow Ceases Picture"... </p><p></p><p>There were textual books as well as pictorial records.</p><p></p><p>But they all shared a common point.</p><p></p><p>They were all about the five Heavenly Sovereigns of the Five Elders Society.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the cultivators of the Alliance of Immortals only knew about the existence of the five Heavenly Sovereigns of the Five Elders Society.</p><p></p><p>Everything else was unknown to them.</p><p></p><p>Now, such a large number of secrets suddenly emerged.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, their attention was drawn to them.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the content of these secret texts became the hottest topic within the Alliance of Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Wherever one went, cultivators could be heard talking about them.</p><p></p><p>Even those who normally didn't care about worldly matters, under the atmosphere of universal discussion, specifically paid attention to it.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli also noticed that in this situation, Senior Sister Zhao's albums unexpectedly lost their attractiveness.</p><p></p><p>Among the secret texts released by the Alliance of Immortals, many revolved around the "Heavenly Sovereign of Eternal Life."</p><p></p><p>They didn't deliberately tone down the erotic parts, but while describing the accomplishments of powerful figures who originated from the mundane and revitalized the sect, they also intertwined many blood-pumping contents.</p><p></p><p>But beauty is beauty, compared to the contents spread by the Five Elders Society, there was a lack of that fatal allure.</p><p></p><p>After seeing them, one wouldn't be unable to eat or sleep.</p><p></p><p>It was just exciting for a moment, and then naturally forgotten.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli pondered, "When the mysterious veil is lifted, the allure also decreases in levels."</p><p></p><p>"After seeing it once, looking again, it feels bland. Although they don't know, the albums about Senior Sister Zhao spread by the Alliance of Immortals and the Five Elders Society are two completely different things."</p>

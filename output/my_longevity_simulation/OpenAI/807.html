        <h1>Chapter 807</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The scene of countless flames raging in the fire world made Su Yuqing, who had never left the capital, pale with shock.</p><p></p><p>However, she now fully understood the origins of the crisis in the world boundary.</p><p></p><p>"Survival of the fittest is the way of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"All things are so, and the world is also so."</p><p></p><p>"The fate of the world boundary's destruction was sealed from the moment it unfortunately collided with the fire world in the void."</p><p></p><p>The immortal sighed lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Flattening that volcano with a wave of my hand is no trouble for me."</p><p></p><p>"But it's just treating the symptoms, not the root cause. It might even provoke stronger resistance from the fire world."</p><p></p><p>"But in a few years, a bigger volcano will surely rise again."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the immortal's words, Su Yuqing couldn't help but show a despairing look on her face.</p><p></p><p>"Is there really no way?" she couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the expression on Su Yuqing's face and thinking about her actions, the immortal seemed to sense something.</p><p></p><p>She quickly kowtowed repeatedly and said, "Please, teach me, immortal!"</p><p></p><p>After nine kowtows, the immortal gently waved his hand to stop her.</p><p></p><p>He slowly said, "That's why I asked you to cultivate."</p><p></p><p>"The balance of power has no fixed rules. The crisis in the world boundary now lies in the fact that the enemy is strong and we are weak. If it were the other way around, the world boundary would be stronger than the fire world. This could not only prevent the world from destruction but might even turn the tables and engulf the fire world."</p><p></p><p>"Ascend the world to a higher level!"</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan said this, he sensed the malice pervading the world around him disappear in an instant!</p><p></p><p>Yes.</p><p></p><p>When he began to act as an immortal and even deceived Su Yuqing, the malice from the world boundary came rushing towards him from all directions.</p><p></p><p>It was even more intense than the attitude of the cultivators towards him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan wasn't afraid even of the heavenly Dao, let alone the small world boundary.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't help feeling a bit uncomfortable being watched so maliciously at all times.</p><p></p><p>He had to resort to some methods to turn the situation around.</p><p></p><p>After all, what he told Su Yuqing was not a lie, but a practical solution.</p><p></p><p>"How can the world boundary become stronger than the fire world?" Su Yuqing's face showed confusion.</p><p></p><p>The fire world she saw in her dreams was extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Not only was the whole world filled with lava, but there were countless magical flames that seemed to have a will of their own.</p><p></p><p>It was not something an ordinary world could resist.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the confused Su Yuqing and smiled faintly, "So-called, man conquers the heavens!"</p><p></p><p>"If you want to help the world boundary overpower the fire world, you need the people of the world boundary to do it themselves!"</p><p></p><p>With these words, Li Fan pointed and a small white jade tower appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Tower of Immortal Spirits. With enough raw materials, it can release a continuous stream of spiritual energy day and night."</p><p></p><p>"People with mortal bodies can't help the world boundary. Only by becoming cultivators can they qualify to participate, or even lead the fight for the world."</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing felt a wave of spiritual energy emanating from the Tower of Immortal Spirits held by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>But as she looked at the tower, she also sensed a trace of bloodthirstiness, furrowing her brows involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>"This little girl is really sensitive," Li Fan observed astutely, nodding slightly at Su Yuqing's expression.</p><p></p><p>Indeed. The Tower of Immortal Spirits was created by Li Fan using the Empire's Spirit Synthesis technique.</p><p></p><p>It essentially generated spiritual energy using large quantities of beast blood and flesh as a base, converting it into spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>For this, Li Fan had specially visited the realm of beasts and collected a large amount of beast blood and flesh.</p><p></p><p>As for the feathers of the mysterious bird and the essence of many grams, they were located deep in the beast realm.</p><p></p><p>With his current Golden Core-stage strength, it was quite difficult to obtain them forcibly, so he left them aside for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Although the Empire's Spirit Synthesis technique had a very low energy conversion efficiency, it was cost-effective.</p><p></p><p>If they could raise beasts on a large scale to solve the source of beast blood and flesh, they could generate spiritual energy almost endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't hide how the Tower of Immortal Spirits produced spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he vividly displayed the scenes of the blood and flesh factory inside it to Su Yuqing.</p><p></p><p>Having never seen such a sight before, Su Yuqing turned pale and vomited on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan huffed, "Compared to the survival of the whole world, what is a little slaughter?"</p><p></p><p>"Does it differ from the chicken, duck, and fish you mortals eat daily?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't put on airs!"</p><p></p><p>He reprimanded her mercilessly.</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing opened her mouth, instinctively wanting to retort.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, she fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan waved his hand to remove the filth from the room and then explained the complete salvation plan to Su Yuqing.</p><p></p><p>The first step was to select the most talented group of people from the world boundary. By using the Tower of Immortal Spirits, they would train them to become the first group of cultivators in the world boundary.</p><p></p><p>The second step was to send them deep into the fire world to absorb and bring back various flames that contained the world's source power.</p><p></p><p>The third step was for the cultivators who had absorbed powerful flames to use their own strength to rebuild the world boundary.</p><p></p><p>With the continuous improvement of the world boundary, the fire world would gradually become weaker.</p><p></p><p>"This is just a deduced result, the specifics will require further exploration. After all, the battle of the world involves levels that cultivators cannot predict," Li Fan sighed lightly.</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing firmly remembered the words of the immortal.</p><p></p><p>Because she had a premonition that the immortal in front of her wouldn't stay in the world boundary for too long.</p><p></p><p>"The path of cultivation is arduous."</p><p></p><p>"The laws of cultivation cannot be trifled with."</p><p></p><p>"I can only help you get started. If you want more, you may need to explore the Xuanhuang Realm yourselves!"</p><p></p><p>With that said, Li Fan pointed at Su Yuqing's forehead.</p><p></p><p>Including the "Thousand Machines, Jade Spheres, Golden Chapter" and a total of twenty cultivation techniques appeared in her mind.</p><p></p><p>However, only the Golden Chapter was of the Yuan Ying level, while the rest were at the foundation-building level.</p><p></p><p>These were the ownerless techniques Li Fan had collected from various cycles of reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>"Practice the Golden Chapter on your own."</p><p></p><p>"The rest can be handed over to suitable individuals," Li Fan instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal, are you leaving?" Su Yuqing couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled gently, "I am just a passing guest. I didn't intend to come to this realm. But I couldn't bear to see the beings suffering, so I intervened. Now that I have done what I could, of course, I will leave."</p><p></p><p>As the nourishment for practicing the "Sitting Immortal Method," Li Fan would naturally not waste too much time here.</p>

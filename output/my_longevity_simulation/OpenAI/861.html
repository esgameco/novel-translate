            <p>"He simply turned a deaf ear. </p><p></p><p>"With many eyes and ears, this clone is currently not suitable to go out. It's better to honestly cultivate in seclusion for a while."</p><p></p><p>"However, it's quite unexpected that the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance would actually release the failed cultivators from the Immortal selection. Jun Shaoli's eyebrows slightly furrowed, a trace of puzzlement flashing through his mind.</p><p></p><p>If the Thirty-Three Pre-Selectees plan is really important.</p><p></p><p>Then at least, their identities should be kept confidential until the Immortal selection plan has not achieved the intended effect.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the failed candidates should not be released, but the real identities of the thirty-three Immortal selectees should be hidden.</p><p></p><p>But the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance has no intention of doing so...</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter who they are."</p><p></p><p>"As long as there are thirty-three people who meet the criteria."</p><p></p><p>Jun Shaoli narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting. Let me see what kind of medicine the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance is selling in their gourd."</p><p></p><p>"It's time to put some pressure on the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance."</p><p></p><p>The clone Jun Shaoli sat motionless on the Hai Xuan Island.</p><p></p><p>In the Spirit Wood Realm, Lin Ling, who received Li Fan's order, went to the Nine Mountain State to make contact with the Five Elders Council again.</p><p></p><p>While the Five Elders Council representatives remained calm on the surface, Lin Ling keenly sensed their intense psychological fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>After sending another batch of supplies as a token of appreciation, Lin Ling revealed crucial information when the Five Elders Council inquired about the "Thirty-Three Immortal Selectees" plan.</p><p></p><p>"To counter the vigilance of the Five Elders Council, besides the Immortal selectees, the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance has also developed many world-renowned artifacts, including the [Heaven's Splitter Cannon]. If you don't take action soon, you may regret it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling faithfully relayed Li Fan's words.</p><p></p><p>Simultaneously, he transmitted a segment of the video.</p><p></p><p>A black pillar of destruction pierced through thick white fog, obliterating everything blocking its path.</p><p></p><p>Although the black pillar gradually disappeared, the void it created had not been filled or restored by the white fog for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Its remaining power prevented external objects from approaching.</p><p></p><p>Even with just a simulated image, the might of the Heaven's Splitter Cannon was evident.</p><p></p><p>Although the Five Elders Council representatives tried to conceal their shock, Lin Ling detected their intense emotions.</p><p></p><p>After taking a deep breath and expressing gratitude, they hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling watched their disappearing figures and smirked.</p><p></p><p>Returning to report through the Earth Pulse, Lin Ling reported to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>In the Five Elements Great Immortal Realm,</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance has truly created this world-renowned artifact."</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's real or fake doesn't matter."</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elders Council was already itching for action, but they were temporarily restrained by the Alliance's cunning moves."</p><p></p><p>"After resolving the incident with the Heaven's Splendor Sphere, and with the pressure of the Thirty-Three Immortal Selectees and the Heaven's Splitter Cannon, I believe they will choose to act aggressively first."</p><p></p><p>"Wait and see."</p><p></p><p>After receiving the message from Lin Ling, Li Fan contemplated for a moment before shifting his focus.</p><p></p><p>Inside his Dantian, a colorful orb emitted a sacred light, dazzling the beholder.</p><p></p><p>"It truly is a treasure formed by refining the light of a world."</p><p></p><p>"To completely control it will not be an overnight task."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan enveloped the orb with his spiritual power, reviewing various scenes swiftly flashing before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>There were cultivators flying amidst white clouds and mortals dwelling on the earth.</p><p></p><p>These were scenes of the extinct Chong Yan Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, due to the passage of time in the world, the details are obscured."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan regretted internally.</p><p></p><p>So far, except for the Xuan Huang Realm, he already knew the names of three cultivation realms - Xiao Yao, Tai Yi, and Chong Yan.</p><p></p><p>However, he knew very little about the specific situations within them.</p><p></p><p>"If I could break free from the constraints of the Fairyland, I could explore them."</p><p></p><p>"However, Chong Yan is already destroyed. The existence of Xiao Yao and Tai Yi is uncertain."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan slowly refined the colorful orb, he diverted most of his focus back to devouring the Five Elements Great Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, not long after, Li Fan noticed some abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>The rate at which the root of the heavens and earth was proliferating had nearly doubled compared to before!</p><p></p><p>At this pace, it wouldn't even take a year to completely devour this Five Elements Great Immortal Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>During this period, Li Fan had not ventured outside.</p><p></p><p>The only variable was the newly acquired colorful orb.</p><p></p><p>While feeling somewhat astonished, Li Fan internally speculated and researched the specific causes of the changes.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he discovered a possible reason.</p><p></p><p>While refining the colorful orb with his spiritual power, a mysterious force was nourishing and transforming the spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>With the support of this force, the roots of the heavens and earth seemed to have received some significant nourishment, leading to their rapid proliferation.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan progressed in refining the colorful orb, the pace of this proliferation continued to increase.</p><p></p><p>Even the initiator, Li Fan, felt a bit jittery.</p><p></p><p>Just like dark clouds driven by a gale, Li Fan was rapidly eroding the Five Elements Great Immortal Realm at an unimaginable pace.</p><p></p><p>"If there weren't too many monsters in the Xuan Huang Realm, I could completely make it mine using this method in just over a decade."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but have this premonition.</p><p></p><p>"What is this mysterious force?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered carefully.</p><p></p><p>After seven days, the realization dawned on him.</p><p></p><p>"The primordial power of the world?"</p><p></p><p>"After being refined into a treasure, it's now retained."</p><p></p><p>"In ordinary confrontations or flying away, this special attribute wouldn't show. However, when it interacts with the roots of the heavens and earth in this new method specifically designed for devouring, it triggers a reaction!"</p><p></p><p>"Like a catalyst, it greatly enhances the power of the roots of the heavens and earth, accelerating the pace of devouring the realm."</p><p></p><p>"Strictly speaking, the passing of the world's essence will have a certain impact on the power of the colorful orb."</p><p></p><p>"It's simply an advancement in time, but not a loss."</p><p></p><p>"But for me..."</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter at all!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan realized this.</p><p></p><p>He then accelerated the process of refining and extracting the primordial power of the world.</p><p></p><p>"Since at the Nascent Soul stage, the world's primordial power is somewhat helpful for advancement."</p><p></p><p>"Then what about the Core Formation, Harmonization, or even Immortality?"</p><p></p><p>"Will they still provide assistance?"</p><p></p><p>Watching the increasingly vigorous countless tentacles, Li Fan couldn't help but contemplate.</p><p></p><p>Using the power of other worlds to devour a world.</p><p></p><p>This was seemingly an impossible task but became possible because of the appearance of the Fishing Pond treasure.</p><p></p><p>-----------------"</p>

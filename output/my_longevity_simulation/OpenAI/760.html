        <h1>Chapter 760</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"You're not afraid that if the Overlord learns about this, they might turn the tables and manipulate us?" Xu Bai's gaze was sharp as he stared at Zi Qiong.</p><p></p><p>Zi Qiong calmly stated, "Manipulate? Heh heh, don't misunderstand. Although I represent the Five Elders' Association on this visit, it doesn't necessarily imply anything significant."</p><p></p><p>"Just merely running some errands for help."</p><p></p><p>Zi Qiong appeared completely confident, a demeanor that left Xu Bai somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be surprised. In the end, the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance belongs to the Transcendent Grandmaster. And I, from beginning to end, only serve the Transcendent Grandmaster. As for everything else, they are all trivial matters."</p><p></p><p>"The Great Dao has fifty, while the Heavens have forty-nine. If the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror seeks to comprehend everything in the world, then there should naturally exist things beyond its control."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, this 'New Heaven' would be imperfect."</p><p></p><p>Zi Qiong looked up at the sky and explained nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>"So, even if the Transcendent Grandmaster were to know about my actions, they wouldn't blame me. Perhaps they might even commend me."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, but those ordinary people might not understand my intentions."</p><p></p><p>Though just a few sentences, the amount of information contained within was rather terrifying. With these words spoken, Xu Bai fell deep into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Until you reach that level, knowing too much may not be a good thing." Before long, the Immortal Zi Qiong interrupted Xu Bai's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>With a casual gesture, they tossed over a 'Void Clear Stone Mother' containing traded goods.</p><p></p><p>This time, no formal contract was established.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Zi Qiong was very confident in their abilities and not afraid of any tricks Xu Bai might pull.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, Xu Bai checked the list of goods inside the stone mother as usual before handing over the predetermined fifty 'Final Discs.'</p><p></p><p>"This is the first batch. The rest will be delivered gradually in the future," Xu Bai explained.</p><p></p><p>The fifty final stone discs were not stored in the storage space but overlaid like thin sheets of paper, separating on command to form individual entities.</p><p></p><p>Zi Qiong took one of the discs in hand to inspect.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, they pondered, "Although this item appears ordinary, it can shield the Heavenly Mysterious Treasure Mirror's senses..."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>After collecting the final disc, Zi Qiong then instructed, "For future transactions, you will interface with others. If Heaven suddenly encounters any urgent situations, you can still find Liu Wenyu."</p><p></p><p>"It's just better not to get too involved with me. Although I'm indifferent..."</p><p></p><p>"But if those people target you, not even my intervention can save you."</p><p></p><p>Zi Qiong's figure gradually faded, departing as unexpectedly as they arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, facing the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror's strong pressure, why did the Five Elders' Association keep backing down repeatedly? Why didn't they have any countermeasures?" Xu Bai asked as Zi Qiong's figure was about to completely disappear.</p><p></p><p>Zi Qiong remained silent, only casting a fleeting glance at the azure sky.</p><p></p><p>Then, they vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Xu Bai also looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, he felt a sudden realization.</p><p></p><p>This 'Heaven' apparently did not refer to the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Zi Qiong stated that they were faithful to the 'Transcendent Grandmaster' from beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>Hence, their actions before departure were quite clear.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that the Five Elders' Association didn't want to counteract.</p><p></p><p>It was just that with the presence of the Transcendent Grandmaster, they dare not act rashly.</p><p></p><p>In Xu Bai's heart, he couldn't help but recall Mr. Bai's sigh and the illusionary scenes.</p><p></p><p>'Facing the Immortal Road ahead, with the Transcendent Grandmaster overseeing.'</p><p></p><p>Subconsciously tightening his grip, Xu Bai thought, 'Perhaps because of the Transcendent's departure in the previous life, Zi Qiong leaned back towards the Five Elders' side and became a pure spy.'</p><p></p><p>'And this life, by utilizing the 'Disorder' technique, I managed to draw the already departed Transcendent back. Therefore, Zi Qiong still maintains that somewhat unique position and hasn't completely acted as a spy for the Five Elders' Association.'</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Xu Bai reasoned through the details and found himself with numerous doubts.</p><p></p><p>The central question was the true purpose of the Transcendent.</p><p></p><p>If her ultimate goal was to transcend and leave the Mysterious Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if she valued the 'Disorder' technique greatly, after futile searches upon her return, she should have chosen to depart again.</p><p></p><p>However, considerable time had elapsed since then.</p><p></p><p>The Transcendent Grandmaster still seemed to linger in the Mysterious Yellow Realm, showing no signs of leaving.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Mysterious Yellow Realm holds a special significance for the Transcendent. It's not something to be casually abandoned."</p><p></p><p>"And this world's Heavenly Mysterious Mirror's advancement must have been permitted by the Transcendent herself. She needs the mirror to undergo a transformation yet tacitly agrees to potential loopholes..."</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Way has its inadequacies. Thus, she must also impose restrictions on the Heavenly Mysterious Mirror."</p><p></p><p>Various conjectures flooded through Xu Bai's mind, despite his extraordinary physique favored by heaven and earth, he still seemed unable to fathom the intention of the Transcendent.</p><p></p><p>A little befuddled, upon returning to Tianling City, he was called over by Nangong Shirong.</p><p></p><p>"Recently, there have been some unfavorable rumors circulating. Go handle it." Nangong Shirong inexplicably passed on this task to him.</p><p></p><p>Logically, Xu Bai was just a liaison envoy for Tianliang Province.</p><p></p><p>Rumors and gossip were issues that could be dealt with by the Garrison or the Martial Hall, both equally capable. However, inexplicably, Nangong Shirong chose to entrust the matter solely to Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, Xu Bai understood.</p><p></p><p>This matter shouldn't be blown out of proportion. It needed swift and graceful resolution.</p><p></p><p>It was Nangong Shirong's acknowledgment of Xu Bai's abilities that made him entrust the task.</p><p></p><p>With a superior's command, subordinates naturally couldn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, I will handle it properly, sir." Xu Bai assured boldly with a respectful cup of hand.</p><p></p><p>After being watched by the other party as he departed, Xu Bai inquired around to find out what Nangong Shirong meant by the 'unfavorable' rumors.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that within Tianliang Province, there was a cultivator named Peng Qing who, before death, suddenly went mad, flying about in a frenzy.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the random flying, he also spoke incoherently.</p><p></p><p>Claiming that his originally allotted lifespan of five hundred years had been reduced, and now with less than four hundred years, he would meet his inevitable end.</p><p></p><p>He accused someone of baselessly diminishing his lifespan and then, in full view of the public, met a tragic end.</p><p></p><p>His death was extremely gruesome, with blood flowing from all seven orifices, and in an instant, he aged hundreds of years as if time had caught up with him.</p>

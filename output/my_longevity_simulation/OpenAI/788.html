        <h1>Chapter 788</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Even if he can really take 'Huan Zhen' from me, he still cannot return to the time that never existed for him."</p><p></p><p>"The new anchor point he can use will definitely be set after obtaining 'Huan Zhen.'"</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, I just need to spread the existence of 'Huan Zhen' in the world before I die. Even if it means successfully taking revenge."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai made his "will" while imagining the scene after his death.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't felt this way in a long time.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he awakened 'Huan Zhen' at the brink of death in the first life, he hadn't thought about the day of his own death.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because it hadn't really arrived yet, there wasn't much fear in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was a mix of feelings, even including a trace of fantasy that he had narrowly escaped disaster.</p><p></p><p>Because it was just the unknown future that made his emotions restless.</p><p></p><p>In the past, no matter what emergency he encountered, he never hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Even if the situation was dire and seemed irreparable, he always said, 'So what if it comes to that!'</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the study as a mortal or the mountain peak where he resided, they were the safest havens in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But now, it was like a sea area filled with reefs and undercurrents suddenly appeared outside the safe haven.</p><p></p><p>A slight misstep could lead to complete destruction.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After his thoughts wandered, he had already finished the first "will." (A website link follows)</p><p></p><p>The so-called "will" was actually an illusion created after the fall of a monk, a vast image of the sky that instantly appeared.</p><p></p><p>It also contained a strand of his consciousness to serve as a switch for explosion or destruction.</p><p></p><p>"These need to be buried deep in spots across the Yellow Realm, corners even I don't know about."</p><p></p><p>"This way, even if Mr. Bai resurrects and wants to stop it, he won't be able to."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, this requires finding someone trustworthy to do it."</p><p></p><p>Various faces flashed through his mind quickly.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he had an idea.</p><p></p><p>After completing one hundred and eight copies of 'soul images,' Xu Bai left Changsheng Valley and went back to Tianliang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>He found his former superior, Nangong Shirong.</p><p></p><p>Initially, Nangong Shirong thought Xu Bai changed his mind and wanted to come back to work.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Bai's request caught him off guard.</p><p></p><p>"The Shuo Soul Token? What do you need this for?" Nangong Shirong scrutinized Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>The Shuo Soul Token was an item from the Bureau of Reincarnation; it could trace the whereabouts of a monk's reincarnation based on items that retained the monk's aura during their past life.</p><p></p><p>It was not openly exchanged among ordinary monks.</p><p></p><p>It was to prevent some people who wanted to escape their punishment through reincarnation by "malicious suicide."</p><p></p><p>"The Bureau of Reincarnation is relatively independent, even though I run a province, it's hard to communicate with them." Nangong Shirong hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai didn't say a word and handed over a storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Shirong, somewhat skeptical, took and checked it. He was almost stunned by the high-quality spirit stones packed inside.</p><p></p><p>With a scan of his divine sense, he realized that the spirit stones inside could be exchanged for a contribution of no less than three million!</p><p></p><p>Nangong Shirong couldn't help but gasp.</p><p></p><p>Although with the era of Baiwu expansion and the conquest of various realms, a large amount of contribution points were distributed, causing the prices within the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance to rise significantly.</p><p></p><p>But three million contribution points were still a huge sum. Even for him, the governor of a province, it was a considerable amount.</p><p></p><p>He knew that to continue advancing required various relationships to manage, and he wasn't always financially comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Swiftly and calmly, he put the storage ring away and sternly said, "Rest assured, leave this to me! Within three days, I will give you an answer!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Xu Bai quietly left with the Shuo Soul Token.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the process, Nangong Shirong never asked about the purpose of this token. After all, some things, when investigated too clearly, were not advantageous.</p><p></p><p>Once out of Tianliang Prefecture, Xu Bai met with Li Fan's true self on the way.</p><p></p><p>After handing over the Shuo Soul Token to him, they exchanged a glance and then parted ways again.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai returned to Changsheng Valley to adapt to changes, while Li Fan began his final arrangements.</p><p></p><p>First, he contacted Dongfang Yao.</p><p></p><p>This person was indeed loyal and righteous, and Li Fan had almost forgotten about Huangfu Song because of him.</p><p></p><p>However, it was difficult to meddle in the affairs of the Bureau of Reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>So after all this time, he still had no results.</p><p></p><p>After being separated for a long time, when they met again, Dongfang Yao warmly greeted him.</p><p></p><p>But when Dongfang Yao received the Shuo Soul Token handed over by Li Fan, he was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan explained the specific use of the Shuo Soul Token, Dongfang Yao's body trembled, "This..."</p><p></p><p>"I know you have always been burdened by Huangfu's passing. I am too. I haven't given up in all these years."</p><p></p><p>"This item is not easy to come by. Keep it safe. When Huangfu is reincarnated, find him yourself."</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao did not expect Li Fan to fulfill his wish.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, he was both surprised and overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Feeling deeply moved, he glanced at Li Fan and noticed something unusual, "Hmm? Find him myself?"</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you come with me? Why leave me to do it alone?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he realized why Li Fan seemed strange, like he was entrusting a burden.</p><p></p><p>His expression changed slightly, and he asked immediately.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked bitter and truthfully confessed, "I've made a powerful enemy, and my life is in danger."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid I may not even have the chance to reincarnate."</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao was shocked at these words.</p><p></p><p>Knowing even the power of the Celestial Lord could be affected, he could imagine how terrifying the enemy mentioned by Li Fan must be.</p><p></p><p>But after a brief hesitation, he decisively offered to help Li Fan without asking why he was being chased, volunteering to assist Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Yet Li Fan shook his head and refused.</p><p></p><p>"I won't involve you in a pointless death. How can I allow you to bear this burden?"</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao hesitated but eventually said, "But..."</p><p></p><p>"If you really want to help me, then why not..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Li Fan handed over a storage ring containing one hundred and eight 'soul images' to Dongfang Yao.</p><p></p><p>"Help me by burying these items separately near the heavens of various provinces, not far underground."</p><p></p><p>"Be careful not to be discovered."</p><p></p><p>"In this way, I might have a glimmer of hope."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan instructed through voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that this matter was related to his friend's life, Dongfang Yao took it very seriously.</p><p></p><p>After bidding farewell to each other reluctantly, he immediately headed towards the nearest heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Even if Mr. Bai has my memories, it will take some time from finding Dongfang Yao to uncovering the locations of the 'soul images' hidden in his mind, destroying them, to execute my plan."</p><p></p><p>"It's enough to initiate my plan."</p>

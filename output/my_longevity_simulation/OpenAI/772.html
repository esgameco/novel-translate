        <h1>Chapter 772</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>He first placed the red string quietly in front of him, then took a deep breath, calming his somewhat excited mood.</p><p></p><p>After all, since he accidentally obtained the Cang Sea Pearl years ago, he hadn't casually picked up any treasures for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai narrowed his eyes, repeatedly recalling the process and details of this imperial journey.</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be a layout by Xiao Qing and the others. This time, I actively went to meet them, and the request to see Xu Ke's legacy was also proposed by me."</p><p></p><p>"And indeed, they are not aware of the peculiarities of the red string..."</p><p></p><p>After much deliberation, Xu Bai, who couldn't find any flaws, did not touch the red string. Instead, he first took out the "Bookworm."</p><p></p><p>The book seemed to be alive, flipping through its pages on its own and projecting various texts and images above.</p><p></p><p>"Blood transformation into fetus..."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a gleam flashed in Xu Bai's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Mr. Bai valued it and created the entire beast empire. The subtlety of this Blood Transformation into Fetus method is almost unmatched by any other body-splitting supernatural power."</p><p></p><p>The creation of avatars in "Mysterious Spiritual Transformation" involves directly refining flesh and blood with precious materials from heaven and earth. Then injecting divine consciousness to sever the connection between the avatar and the main body, forming a completely independent entity.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, "Blood Transformation into Fetus" is capable of differentiating another body identical to oneself solely through the cultivation of one's own essence, blood, and flesh, without relying on spiritual power or divine consciousness. </p><p></p><p>The entire process is similar to regrowing a severed limb. However, what grows back is another self.</p><p></p><p>Before completely separating from the mother body, the avatar will always be connected to the main body's flesh and blood. This process is similar to the human process of conceiving offspring, which is why Xu Ke named it "Blood Transformation into Fetus."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai then took out three items from his storage ring to catalyze the "Blood Transformation into Fetus."</p><p></p><p>They are: the Eternal Dragon Blood, the Brahma Soul Insect, and the Pure Light Core.</p><p></p><p>The original "Blood Transformation into Fetus" passed down by Xu Ke considered that users were ordinary people without cultivation. Therefore, the nurturing of the sacred fetus, which is the next generation, required a lengthy process, mostly needing half a year waiting for the fetus to grow gradually.</p><p></p><p>During this period, one also constantly needs to consume various highly nourishing herbs and meats to sustain the normal growth of the sacred fetus.</p><p></p><p>However, throughout the thousands of years of development in the empire, after the research by generations of emperors, methods were found to catalyze this process using the magical properties of various exotic beasts.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Dragon Blood greatly promotes the circulation of the body's qi and blood, compressing the period for nurturing the sacred fetus from half a year to a month or even several days.</p><p></p><p>The Brahma Soul Insect can nourish spiritual consumption.</p><p></p><p>The Pure Light Core, when implanted into the sacred fetus, ensures that the sacred fetus is not affected by diseases during its nurturing process.</p><p></p><p>"Everything has its pros and cons. Although using external forces can significantly reduce the time required to nurture the sacred fetus, it also creates many drawbacks. Due to the accelerated growth, the quickly nurtured sacred fetus is almost indistinguishable from the original body. Just like Xiao Qing said, it is almost identical to a clone."</p><p></p><p>"The ancient 'Blood Transformation into Fetus' method, over the years, allows the sacred fetus to develop its own consciousness. However, it is more similar in appearance to the original body."</p><p></p><p>"Which of the two is better is hard to say."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai glanced at the three items, silently pondering.</p><p></p><p>"However, this expedited method is what I need now."</p><p></p><p>Inhaling the Eternal Dragon Blood into his abdomen, Xu Bai silently activated the Blood Transformation into Fetus method.</p><p></p><p>A strong burning sensation surged from his stomach, then rushed like a wildfire, spreading through his whole body in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Plop...</p><p></p><p>A huge growth suddenly emerged on Xu Bai's back.</p><p></p><p>The flesh and blood tissues were continuously wriggling inside it, causing the growth to expand rapidly, changing from the size of a fist to that of a baby in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Xu Bai was wearing clothing made by Fang Zaiji that could withstand combined attacks, so he didn't have to worry about his clothes bursting.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Transformation into Fetus method allows the user to designate any part of their body as the growth point of the sacred fetus according to their thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Each emperor in the empire's history had their preferences. Xu Bai chose his back.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was influenced by the scene he witnessed when he was still a foundation-building cultivator, being chased by the red-haired infant, where he saw the "baby phantom resembling a parasite clinging to the back of a volcanic cave."</p><p></p><p>"Without the vigorous vitality brought by the Five Elements Mutual Generation, the flesh and blood tissues are in a super-active state, breaking free from the usual constraints of division."</p><p></p><p>"The so-called Eternal Dragon is just a long jiao of the Blue Divine Dragon line. Yet, it still has such a significant effect on Foundation-Building cultivators." Xu Bai felt an ant-like crawling itch on his back and couldn't help but be astonished.</p><p></p><p>The scorching Eternal Dragon Blood surged constantly within Xu Bai's body.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, seven days had passed.</p><p></p><p>The growth on Xu Bai's back already vaguely resembled a human figure.</p><p></p><p>In Xu Bai's perception, the sacred fetus was truly like a part of his body, able to be manipulated at will.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the sacred fetus responded to his mind's commands, making various continuous movements. However, since the sacred fetus had not fully developed yet, just like a face covered with a cloth, its features were indistinct, giving a somewhat eerie feeling.</p><p></p><p>"It's time." After thoroughly familiarizing himself with the sacred fetus, Xu Bai controlled the Pure Light Core with his divine consciousness, slowly approaching the growth on his back.</p><p></p><p>The swelling flesh and blood seemed to vanish.</p><p></p><p>Without any obstruction, the Pure Light Core directly penetrated into it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai clearly felt the once chaotic and uncontrolled proliferation of flesh and blood tissues within the sacred fetus gradually calming down.</p><p></p><p>The Pure Light Core gradually dissolved into the flesh and blood, causing the growth on Xu Bai's back to emit a faint white light.</p><p></p><p>His limbs and features began to differentiate from the sacred fetus.</p><p></p><p>Describing him as smooth because his entire body, not just without a single hair, even lacked the wrinkles on his skin.</p><p></p><p>His body gleamed with a white luster, like it was carved from white jade.</p><p></p><p>"Next is the final step."</p><p></p><p>"My divine consciousness far exceeds that of ordinary people, so I no longer need the Brahma Soul Insect for replenishing spiritual consumption."</p><p></p><p>Focusing a portion of his consciousness on the sacred fetus on his back, Xu Bai operated the Blood Transformation into Fetus method. In his visualization, the sacred fetus underwent earth-shaking changes in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Bones formed, the soft and flabby sacred fetus inflated and straightened up like an inflated balloon.</p><p></p><p>Hair, nails, and various skin areas gradually appeared.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a master engraver was meticulously working on the originally bald flesh.</p><p></p><p>The human traces of the sacred fetus became more and more distinct.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after...</p><p></p><p>The face on Xu Bai's back suddenly opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>Simultaneously, the parts connecting the sacred fetus and the main body began shedding layers of flesh and blood on their own.</p><p></p><p>With a gentle pat on his main body's shoulder, Xu Bai lightly dropped the sacred fetus onto the ground.</p>

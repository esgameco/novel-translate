        <h1>Chapter 964</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I'm not sure how long passed when a slight tremor in the entire Spirit Wood Realm woke him up.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan cast his gaze towards the center of the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>The giant tree that was originally verdant, towering straight into the sky, was now showing astonishing anomalies.</p><p></p><p>The branches and leaves swayed without wind, enveloped in a layer of misty, glistening white light.</p><p></p><p>At the top of the ancient tree, a beam of light shot up into the sky, piercing a hole in the sky dome.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't an exaggerated rhetoric; at this moment, a real void appeared in the sky of the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>The void seemed to have a terrifying suction force, drawing in the surrounding clouds.</p><p></p><p>Underneath the giant tree, all the tree people stopped their work and knelt down.</p><p></p><p>There was no panic on their faces, only joy emanating from their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"World upgrade?"</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Wood Realm was now considered Li Fan's semi-treasure. With a slight sense, he understood what was happening.</p><p></p><p>The nourishing feedback from Lin Ling, the modification from the Tian Jing calabash given by Shang Tianci. Most importantly, thousands of Heavenly furnaces continuously released spiritual energy...</p><p></p><p>Under the overlapping of these factors, it finally led to the Spirit Wood Realm completing its transformation.</p><p></p><p>This was a rare and peculiar scene that occurred once in thousands of years, seldom recorded even in the scriptures of immortality.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and the people in the Spirit Wood Realm all held their breath, watching and understanding as they witnessed it.</p><p></p><p>Outside the world, in the void, something seemed to be extracted and infused into the Spirit Wood Realm through the hole in the sky.</p><p></p><p>A faint rumble resounded through the heavens and earth. Outwardly, it seemed like there were no major changes in the appearance of the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>But as the owner of the Spirit Wood Realm, Li Fan keenly sensed that the overall power of the Spirit Wood Realm was rapidly rising.</p><p></p><p>The most obvious change was in the giant tree that was the foundation of this realm.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Li Fan could easily destroy the giant tree with a single strike.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, from the roots to the branches and leaves, every part of the giant tree was becoming increasingly tough.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it became capable of withstanding a blow from Li Fan himself without being uprooted and destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The void vortex gradually shrank and disappeared completely.</p><p></p><p>The upgrade of the Spirit Wood Realm finally came to an end.</p><p></p><p>Although the actual size of the Spirit Wood Realm seemed unchanged, everyone who witnessed the process of the world upgrade in this realm inexplicably felt a sensation.</p><p></p><p>The sky became broader, the ground wider, even the air became more refreshing.</p><p></p><p>Life force was an invisible thing, but its presence could be distinctly felt.</p><p></p><p>In this upgrade, the biggest beneficiary apart from the Spirit Wood Realm itself was the female leader of the tree people.</p><p></p><p>Finally breaking through the threshold, her strength was equivalent to a joint cultivation practitioner in the Xuan Huang Realm.</p><p></p><p>She had almost shed off her appearance of a tree person, becoming almost indistinguishable from human cultivation practitioners.</p><p></p><p>Only the natural patterns on her face distinguished her as a tree person.</p><p></p><p>Cloaked in a green dress, the female leader of the tree people issued orders, commanding all tree people to continue bowing and praising Li Fan, the master of the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, Li Fan's calm voice echoed from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Wood upgraded, a new beginning. From now on, your destiny is no longer confined to this realm..."</p><p></p><p>"I bestow upon you a name..."</p><p></p><p>"Lin Xin!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Xin's face lit up with excitement as she led the group of tree people in bowing and worshiping once again.</p><p></p><p>And Shang Tianci, Tianyang, and the others also showed a sense of emotion.</p><p></p><p>They instructed everyone to continue manufacturing the Heavenly furnaces, while Li Fan's attention shifted to the Spirit Wood Realm itself.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, if it weren't already captured by the Xuan Huang Realm, based on the current level of the Spirit Wood Realm, it should have met the minimum requirements for the Immortal Realm." Combining the descriptions of the world in the "Sky-Repairing Records," Li Fan pondered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"As long as the way to immortality is not severed, the recent world upgrade can leave a mark on the path to ascension to immortality. When the cultivation of practitioners in the world reaches a certain realm, they can ascend during the day and become immortal. It's a pity..."</p><p></p><p>"Since the way to immortality is severed and turned into a vassal of the Xuan Huang Realm. It may be upgraded, but it's still a subordinate small world under the Xuan Huang Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly: "The Xuan Huang Realm is truly detrimental!"</p><p></p><p>"However, speaking of this, since the Spirit Wood Realm can still upgrade the world. Can the Xuan Huang Realm do the same?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a long time, ultimately concluding: "Theoretically, the Xuan Huang Realm still has the potential to upgrade."</p><p></p><p>"To ascend to the Immortal Realm!" Li Fan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps..."</p><p></p><p>"Only when the Xuan Huang Realm is a hundred times larger than it is now would there be a slight possibility of ascending to the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>"However, even then, it may not be worthy of the term 'Immortal Realm.' Describing it as an 'Immortal Domain' may be more appropriate."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but imagine.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that all of the above were Li Fan's speculation based on the brief descriptions of the "Sky-Repairing Records" regarding the Immortal Realm, resulting in some conjecture.</p><p></p><p>As for the actual situation...</p><p></p><p>Not even the author of the "Sky-Repairing Records," Tian Yi, had seen the Immortal Realm with his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>The topic was impossible to confirm.</p><p></p><p>However, based on Li Fan's understanding of Tian Yi, this person was very rigorous in his academics. If it were just pure speculation without substantial evidence, he wouldn't easily write it in his book.</p><p></p><p>"The Honored Elder of the Tian Fa Realm enforces the heavenly laws, maybe he knows some secrets from before the way to immortality was severed."</p><p></p><p>Observing this world upgrade once again brought some inspiration to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>About the essence of the world's operation and the ultimate fit of the techniques for himself.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was a person who didn't act without a purpose.</p><p></p><p>Although he had come into contact with a considerable number of techniques in the cycle of reincarnation, he still believed that the "Sitting Immortal Technique" from the "Sitting Mountain Records" was the most suitable for him.</p><p></p><p>However, at his current level of cultivation, he needed to face old monsters like Tian Yi, Ruomu, and the predecessors of the stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>Simple cultivation of techniques had already become less helpful to him. If he was falling behind others in the fundamental techniques, how could he compete with them?</p><p></p><p>The guidance of Tian Yi once again surfaced in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, techniques are secondary. What truly matters is contemplation of the operation of the heavenly path and the essence of the world."</p><p></p><p>"No matter how powerful a technique is, it ultimately belongs to someone else. Only the one truly suitable for yourself is the most perfect technique."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes shimmered with thoughts, his gaze distant.</p><p></p><p>"Sky-Repairing Records," "Sitting Immortal Technique," world upgrades...</p><p></p><p>In his mind, a fierce storm seemed to have stirred up, with all past experiences and insights pouring into it.</p><p></p><p>After being tempered as if in a furnace, they finally burst open with three big characters in Li Fan's mind!</p><p></p><p>(Note: The text you provided contains a watermark and certain modifications due to guidelines.

        <h1>Chapter 872</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>It is precisely Li Fan who transformed into the appearance of a Yuan Ying based on the nearly endless source power of the Five Elements Cave.</p><p></p><p>If it were to appear in the Xuanhuang Realm, this giant figure would be enough to hold up the sky and attract the attention of cultivators worldwide.</p><p></p><p>Behind the giant's head, faintly visible are the five great virtual shadows of the Five Elements Caves, like five interconnected rings. They complement Li Fan's appearance with unparalleled sacredness.</p><p></p><p>Compared to this giant, Tianyang was almost as insignificant as an ant.</p><p></p><p>"Suppression!"</p><p></p><p>The giant looked down, extending his right index finger fiercely pressing down towards Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>The fingertip encompassed the top of the head, looking as though the sky itself was collapsing. The fingerprints on it seemed like circular spells, as if to suppress Tianyang in an instant.</p><p></p><p>For the first time, Tianyang realized how he appeared in the eyes of ordinary cultivators. Facing the giant's sky-shattering blow, Tianyang remained calm.</p><p></p><p>His clothes moved without wind, and a strange distortion occurred in the space around him.</p><p></p><p>The bending of space resembled layers of waves, emanating outward from Tianyang as the center.</p><p></p><p>As it continued to advance, Tianyang's figure became more and more illusory.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he had completely disappeared from the scene!</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan's finger descended, it struck emptiness!</p><p></p><p>"Interesting! Even with the power of the Five Elements combined with the array that seals space, I still couldn't prevent you from escaping..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's Yuan Ying spoke with a booming voice, his gaze scanning the surroundings constantly.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to find Tianyang's trail.</p><p></p><p>But Tianyang seemed to have completely vanished, not showing any slightest breath or movement.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, don't..."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan's words were halfway spoken, Tianyang appeared suddenly without warning, like a ghost, pointing towards the head of the Yuan Ying.</p><p></p><p>Appearing out of thin air, he pointed towards the center of the Yuan Ying's forehead from a distance.</p><p></p><p>Like a drop of water falling into a calm pond, the head of the Yuan Ying twisted strangely.</p><p></p><p>And then shattered with a bang!</p><p></p><p>Tianyang was about to stop but the shattered head didn't seem to affect the Yuan Ying's actions at all.</p><p></p><p>His hands quickly clasped in front of him, fingertips splaying out to form a cage.</p><p></p><p>The energy fragments of the head, resembling spirits, rapidly approached.</p><p></p><p>Outside the cage of fingers, they momentarily transformed into an array!</p><p></p><p>Tianyang was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Because he found that within this array, not only could he not break through space to escape, but even the Space Folding technique he had just used lost its effect!</p><p></p><p>It was effective just a moment ago, but in the next moment, Li Fan found a way to break it with the array!</p><p></p><p>What a genius!</p><p></p><p>Before Tianyang could think further, one layer after another of array shadows appeared outside the cage of fingers.</p><p></p><p>As if there were no limits, in just a breath's time, the power emanating from these layered arrays had expanded to a point that even a cultivator at the Harmony Realm would be moved by it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the price was Li Fan's Yuan Ying, which shrank like a punctured balloon in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the constant threat of bursting around him, Tianyang dared not move.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's figure then appeared not far away, looking smug, "How about that, Junior Brother. Convinced?"</p><p></p><p>Tianyang nodded reluctantly.</p><p></p><p>"Haha." Li Fan did not push Tianyang further, but his eyes flashed with a blue light.</p><p></p><p>Then he gently pointed towards Tianyang's location.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the immensely complex and huge array in Tianyang's eyes was effortlessly broken by Li Fan!</p><p></p><p>"I didn't even use my full power. I wouldn't want to hurt you." Seeing Tianyang's somewhat unwilling look, Li Fan emphasized.</p><p></p><p>"I... understand." Tianyang struggled to say those three words.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Li Fan again, he voluntarily proposed a rematch.</p><p></p><p>"Eh!" Unexpectedly, Li Fan just waved his hand, rejecting the offer.</p><p></p><p>"Let's stop here in our sparring. Do we, as senior brothers, have to fight to the death?"</p><p></p><p>"No more fighting, no more fighting!" Li Fan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang, feeling helpless, did not want to push further either.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Junior Brother, your power is also related to space. Not far ahead, there is a small world. It is full of a type of spiritual beings that might be helpful to you." Li Fan introduced Tianyang to the situation in the Soul Shadow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Tianyang couldn't make heads or tails of such strange matters.</p><p></p><p>But he always listened to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>So the two continued to delve deeper through the spatial passage.</p><p></p><p>They had already moved far away from the Xuanhuang Realm, and Li Fan no longer had any reservations.</p><p></p><p>The colorful divine light tore through the vast space, covering vast distances in an instant.</p><p></p><p>And Tianyang, proficient in manipulating space, was able to follow closely behind, shrinking the distance at will.</p><p></p><p>Although the two moved at such a fast pace, the length of this spatial passage still exceeded their imagination.</p><p></p><p>According to Li Fan's calculations, it took them almost a month to vaguely sense the crackle whale group ahead.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan halted his steps.</p><p></p><p>Looking into the distance, he saw countless crackle whales, forming a sea of whales in the void, opening up paths in groups.</p><p></p><p>And this was just what was visible.</p><p></p><p>In the pitch-black void, who knew how many more crackle whales existed.</p><p></p><p>The immense aura the crackle group emitted made Li Fan's expression change slightly.</p><p></p><p>"This is a quantitative change to a qualitative change."</p><p></p><p>"Why are there so many of them?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but turn to look at the Soul Shadow Realm hidden not far away.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Transforming into a rainbow light, Li Fan descended into the small world after a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Sss..."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he landed, Li Fan frowned.</p><p></p><p>This place was just too cold.</p><p></p><p>Even his spiritual power inside him was showing signs of being frozen.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements' power circulated, as Li Fan wanted to resist the severe cold by transforming his spiritual power into fire attributes.</p><p></p><p>But at the moment he did so, a terrifying icy power surged inexplicably from within him.</p><p></p><p>Instantly turning into an ice sculpture, then with a gust of unknown cold wind blowing, it turned into countless ice particles, filling the ground.</p><p></p><p>After a while, a wave of movement passed, and Li Fan's body appeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Weird."</p><p></p><p>A curious expression appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>Just a moment ago, alongside the fire attribute power within him, what emerged was not heat but extreme cold.</p><p></p><p>This cold was not from the external environment, but a characteristic inherent to the fire attribute here.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, something's off here."</p><p></p><p>Tianyang, rare for him, spoke coherently with a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>"The surroundings seem to be devouring my abilities."</p><p></p><p>"But I can't locate them."</p><p></p><p></p>

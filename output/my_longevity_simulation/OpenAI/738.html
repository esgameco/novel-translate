            <p>"The more formation data the resolution disc absorbs, the stronger its decryption ability will become. Similarly, its deducing and iterating capabilities will also become more powerful. It's truly unimaginable how far they will grow in the future."</p><p></p><p>"How do you know, in your hands, whether the resolution disc will evolve into a second Tianxuan Mirror?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>For the resolution disc to complete its transformation, it needs fuel - various formations. Li Fan has been immersed in formations for several lifetimes. Purely in terms of formation ability, perhaps he still can't rank high in the current Wanxian League.</p><p></p><p>But in terms of wide knowledge and experience, Li Fan is confident he won't lose to anyone.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Zhiliang's "Infinite Law," He Zhenghao's "Mountain and River Hundred Veins Formation Map," Yaowang Sect's "Dream of Spring and Autumn Formation"...</p><p></p><p>Even the astonishing and extraordinary existences like the "Tianxuan Spirit Lock Formation" that hasn't appeared in this world, and the "Reversing Life and Death Great Formation" in the Realm of Life and Death. Li Fan is well aware of them.</p><p></p><p>If Li Fan were to personally arrange these formations, perhaps he might fall short in practical ability. But if it's just virtual deduction and calculations, then there won't be any difficulties at all.</p><p></p><p>In the competition for the supremacy of the Nine Discs, obtaining the complete resolution disc is also a test for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>As a probe for the Tianxuan secondary body, whether the resolution disc will have a connection with the original body Tianxuan Mirror relies on the "Tianxuan Spirit Lock Formation."</p><p></p><p>If there's a certain connection between the resolution disc and the Tianxuan Mirror, and the Tianxuan Mirror can perceive the situation of the secondary body here, as long as Li Fan inputs the data of the Spirit Lock Formation into the resolution disc, it will definitely attract the attention of the Wanxian League and forces leaning towards the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>They will definitely come knocking based on the resolution disc's location.</p><p></p><p>Conversely, if until the resolution disc completes its transformation, everything remains calm. It means that, as advertised, after the secondary body separates, it disconnects from the Tianxuan Mirror. It can be treated as an individual entity. At least the resolution disc is like that.</p><p></p><p>"There may be some risks, but it's worth a try."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted his eyes, and countless rapidly changing formations were reflected in his pupils.</p><p></p><p>The resolution disc in his hand also emitted a faint light following his movements.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was seeking the complete Tianxuan secondary body, Xu Bai in Tianliang Prefecture encountered a troublesome matter.</p><p></p><p>Since he took on the role of communication envoy, many offspring of nobles from other prefectures were assigned to various unimportant positions in Tianliang Prefecture. Initially, he managed it well, and everyone involved was relatively satisfied.</p><p></p><p>But recently, one of them, a cultivator named Guan Changge from Tianyu Prefecture, went missing.</p><p></p><p>These days, it's not a matter of fearing death but fearing disappearance.</p><p></p><p>If someone dies, they can still be reincarnated in the Netherworld after eighteen years and be a hero again. But if someone disappears...</p><p></p><p>There are countless possibilities.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai also knew Guan Changge's senior, who was the commander of the defense garrison in Tianyu Prefecture, Guan Xingxiu. With his status, Xu Bai shouldn't personally inquire about this matter; at most, he should send someone to ask.</p><p></p><p>But he personally arrived in Tianliang Prefecture, taking on an appearance of questioning with authority.</p><p></p><p>This clearly indicated that this matter was unusual.</p><p></p><p>The newly appointed Lord of Tianliang City, Nangong Shirong, solemnly promised to provide an explanation.</p><p></p><p>After temporarily calming Guan Xingxiu down, he handed the task over to Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>In a secret room, he looked serious: "This matter is a bit suspicious. We only received the report not long ago, and Guan Xingxiu has already arrived. It's as if he knew in advance..."</p><p></p><p>"He must be here for us. You go investigate the situation first, I will go to the Immortal Alliance headquarters. If there are any discoveries, do not act rashly. Wait for me to return." After instructing, Nangong Shirong hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>With the assigned task, Xu Bai temporarily put aside all his affairs and went to the place where Guan Changge was last seen.</p><p></p><p>Tianliang Prefecture, Mount Wuliang.</p><p></p><p>"Did Guan Changge disappear right in front of you here?" Xu Bai swept his spiritual sense over the mountains below and asked.</p><p></p><p>The three cultivators behind him nodded repeatedly, looking very tense.</p><p></p><p>One of them said, "It is said that like the 'Mortal to Divine Wall' on Mount Wuliang, there are occasional anomalies. So we discussed and came here to observe. Who knew that just as we arrived and were figuring out the position of the 'Mortal Wall,' Brother Guan suddenly disappeared."</p><p></p><p>Another person continued, "Initially, we thought he had something urgent and went back first. We didn't pay much attention. But when we finished watching the strange scene on the 'Mortal Wall' and returned to Tianliang City and still couldn't contact Brother Guan, we knew something was wrong."</p><p></p><p>"Not only can we not contact him through communication charms, but even after deducing the items Brother Guan left with me, I still didn't get any results," the last cultivator named Fu Xingchi added.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai flew a circle above Mount Wuliang and did not perceive any abnormal reactions.</p><p></p><p>Given the affinity between him and the heavenly Dao, if there were issues on Mount Wuliang, he would sense them for sure.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the problem was not with the location here...</p><p></p><p>Wait a minute.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai suddenly thought of something and asked, "Where is this 'Mortal Wall' you mentioned?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Xingchi was stunned for a moment, then pointed to a canyon below, saying, "It's at the foot of the mountain."</p><p></p><p>"Take me there," Xu Bai said with a serious tone.</p><p></p><p>Although the three people didn't understand, they knew it was a serious matter and didn't dare to raise any objections.</p><p></p><p>They led Xu Bai to the 'Mortal Wall.'</p><p></p><p>On the mountain surface that was originally covered with rubble and vegetation, as it neared the base, it suddenly became as smooth as a mirror.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai stared at the mountain surface mirror, approximately three hundred feet long and over fifty feet high, seeing his reflection in it.</p><p></p><p>When he touched it, it felt as cold as jade.</p><p></p><p>"Did you all see the so-called anomaly back then?" Xu Bai inquired.</p><p></p><p>Fu Xingchi nodded, "The timing of the anomalies appearing on the 'Mortal Wall' is not fixed, sometimes several times a day. Sometimes they may not appear continuously for several years. It all depends on individual chances."</p><p></p><p>"Our luck last time was not bad. We saw a scene of a cultivator dancing with a sword. Although the sword technique was very slow, it seemed to conceal supreme swordsmanship, attracting all of us completely and entrapping us."</p><p></p><p>"Can you recreate what you saw back then?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, Fu Xingchi took out a pen and started sketching in the air.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, just like directly recording with Water Mirror Art, a vivid scene of a cultivator dancing with a sword appeared before everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Fu's painting skills are indeed extraordinary. It's just like what I remember," the other two cultivators couldn't help but admire.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai stared at the sword dancing scene for a long time and suddenly asked, "Does Guan Changge know swordsmanship?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Xingchi froze on the spot.</p><p></p><p>But soon he realized, "Are you suspecting that the figure that appeared in the 'Mortal Wall' was Brother Guan?'</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, Brother Guan cultivates the musical road, not swordsmanship," Fu Xingchi shook his head in denial.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that Brother Changge admires Senior Guan Xingxiu very much. He often regrets not being able to master awe-inspiring swordsmanship like Senior Guan," at this moment, another cultivator suddenly recalled.</p><p></p><p>With this statement, everyone present fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>They all looked unanimously at the 'Mortal Wall' in front, feeling a wave of icy chill rising in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>It was Xu Bai who first broke the silence: "Currently, it's just speculation, there's no substantial evidence. For now, help me seal off Mount Wuliang, don't let others approach. I'll go back first and check whether similar incidents have occurred before."</p><p></p><p>Fu Xingchi and the other two had heavy expressions and nodded in acknowledgment.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai hastily returned to Tianliang City and requested to pull up the historical records from years past.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, he found something suspicious.</p><p></p><p>In the past century, there were frequent reports of inexplicable disappearances of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But they were all unaffiliated wandering cultivators.</p><p></p><p>After disappearing, it was just the few cultivators who had better relationships with them reporting to the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The path of cultivation is full of uncertainties and vicissitudes.</p><p></p><p>After investigating and confirming that it wasn't the work of spies from the Five Elders' Council and still couldn’t find any useful clues, these cases often ended without a resolution.</p><p></p><p>Thus, after countless nameless cultivators were silently swallowed by the 'Mortal Wall,' unnoticed by anyone, the current disappearance case unfolded.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

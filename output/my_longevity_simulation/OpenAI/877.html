        <h1>Chapter 877</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, covering his hands over it.</p><p></p><p>He activated the Five Elders' secret technique from memory.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed effective, as layers of ripples appeared on the surface of the stone, revealing a face resembling a person on a model lake.</p><p></p><p>After seeing the situation on this side clearly, the opposite side first froze.</p><p></p><p>Then, the scene turned, as if a substitute had been made.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at Li Fan, the other party coldly snorted after a while, "You even know the just modified receiving secret technique..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Union of Ten Thousand Realms has indeed planted nails among us."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and said, "It's not a big deal. It was just a random try, merely a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>There was a loud bang from the opposite side, clearly expressing extreme dissatisfaction with Li Fan's attitude.</p><p></p><p>Without ending the communication, the other party asked, "What brings you to us this time?"</p><p></p><p>"Last time, we were tricked miserably by you. You talked about the World-sealing Supreme Weapon, the Sky-splitting Cannon."</p><p></p><p>"We prepared a complete set of countermeasures, thinking of an unexpected victory. But we didn’t expect..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, due to false information leading to a misjudgment in strategic direction. We suffered heavy losses."</p><p></p><p>The face on the stone mirror suddenly swelled up, matching his tone, appearing somewhat sinister.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted his eyes and didn't answer immediately.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, he shook his head and sighed, "It wasn’t intentional for me to provide false information. The Alliance of Myriad Immortals really acted too realistically this time, even fooling us."</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought that such a powerful World-sealing Supreme Weapon was just a smokescreen?"</p><p></p><p>"However, you guys didn't do much better, did you?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's tone suddenly changed, "As the esteemed Five Elders Alliance, how could you set a major strategic direction based on just our words?"</p><p></p><p>"Surely, you must have discovered something before finally deciding."</p><p></p><p>"If even you are like this, how can we avoid it? We can only say that the Alliance of Myriad Immortals really played it cleverly."</p><p></p><p>The face of the Five Elders' representative looked grim.</p><p></p><p>"We originally thought that the grand thirty-three Immortal Chosen Ones were just a façade. The real killer moves must be hidden elsewhere. Who could have expected that the Alliance of Myriad Immortals would be so arrogant, with no hidden agenda."</p><p></p><p>"Directly laying their cards on the table..."</p><p></p><p>In the voice of the face, there was a tone of frustration, as if putting in a lot of effort but ending up with nothing.</p><p></p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Li Fan asked, "What exactly happened on the battlefield of Jiushan Province?"</p><p></p><p>"You guys were defeated too quickly. We received the news and had to come to the scene personally to confirm it to believe it's true."</p><p></p><p>The face of the Five Elders looked dark, remaining silent.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan directly showcased his trump card.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Hall of the Alliance of Myriad Immortals, the Purple Realm Immortal, is actually one of you guys, right?"</p><p></p><p>The face directly froze.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that with his level, he was not qualified enough to know about this matter.</p><p></p><p>"Go and confirm with your superiors. This person..."</p><p></p><p>"There are problems. He cannot be completely trusted," Li Fan said with a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>The face no longer appeared calm as before, hurriedly retreated and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan calmly waited.</p><p></p><p>On the side, Lin Ling was quietly observing Li Fan, unable to contain her curiosity.</p><p></p><p>The reaction of the Five Elders was swift.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, a figure reappeared on the smooth stone surface.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, about what you said earlier..."</p><p></p><p>"Regarding not fully trusting the Purple Realm Immortal, what does it mean?" spoke a man's voice, more mature and vigorous.</p><p></p><p>"If our information is correct, the Purple Realm Immortal is a [Crazy Cultivator]. His true loyalty is not to your Five Elders Alliance, nor to the Alliance of Myriad Immortals."</p><p></p><p>"But only to the Great Law Heavenly Master." Li Fan whispered.</p><p></p><p>"Sometimes, his information is correct. But in certain situations..."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid there's a mix of truth and falsehood and it's hard to distinguish." Li Fan said meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>Although his words were puzzling, the Five Elders were plunged into a long silence.</p><p></p><p>"I see..." From the murmuring of the Five Elders' man, it was easy to hear the shock in his heart at this moment.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Purple Realm Immortal was the deepest hidden and most important spy of the Five Elders.</p><p></p><p>This matter was absolutely confidential. Originally, only a few people within the Five Elders knew about it.</p><p></p><p>However, the cultivator from the Union of Ten Thousand Realms already knew the true identity of the Purple Realm.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the previous major defeat caused by false information...</p><p></p><p>The implications of these events truly sent shockwaves through the middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>But his mental resilience was extraordinary, and he quickly recovered.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he thanked Li Fan, "We will investigate this matter thoroughly. Thank you for the reminder, friend."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan cut to the chase, "We need to know what exactly happened in Jiushan Province. Due to a misjudgment, our attention was not on the battlefield of Jiushan Province at that time."</p><p></p><p>"Although we managed to gather some information from within the Alliance of Myriad Immortals, it was too shocking. We need to confirm it with you."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, in a short while, she will appear regularly... I will send you the scene at that time for you to see." The middle-aged man seemed eager to confirm the truth of the information provided by Li Fan, transmitted a piece of information, and then bid farewell and left.</p><p></p><p>The smooth stone shattered on its own and could no longer be used.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan watched the scene unfolding in his mind, feeling shaken.</p><p></p><p>The clear blue sky and tranquil clouds of Jiushan Province.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a face appeared.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a tall crown, with a face covered in long beard.</p><p></p><p>Solemn expression, eyes lowered.</p><p></p><p>There was a sense of compassion for all living beings, as well as an infinite hidden killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Any cultivator of the Alliance of Myriad Immortals would not be unfamiliar with this face.</p><p></p><p>Because in every celestial city in each province, even in every territory of the Alliance of Myriad Immortals.</p><p></p><p>The image of this figure could be seen from time to time.</p><p></p><p>He was the creator of the Alliance of Myriad Immortals, the innovator of the new laws against the heavens, the Supreme Law Transmitter who had been dominating Xuanhuang for thousands of years!</p><p></p><p>As the image of the transcriber's face appeared, a vague figure also quickly appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the cultivators of the Five Elders in Jiushan Province also sensed the anomaly in the sky.</p><p></p><p>They quickly gathered, preparing for battle.</p><p></p><p>But the Transcriber didn't give them much time to prepare and made a move.</p><p></p><p>The Transcriber, who had been low-headed and closed his eyes all along, suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Following that, a terrifying force unimaginable descended upon Jiushan Province.</p><p></p><p>Numerous cultivators were turned into minced meat, unable to even let out a scream, blood flowing everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Under this immense pressure, Jiushan's nine mountain ranges continued to rumble.</p><p></p><p>The mountains collapsed, layers broke apart.</p><p></p><p>From top to bottom, constantly crumbling.</p><p></p><p>The Transcriber didn't shift his gaze and the terrifying pressure descending upon Jiushan Province did not cease.</p>

            <p>Among them, "Heaven and Earth Taxation" and "Only I Know the Eternal Secret" and a few other techniques were almost completely consistent with the knowledge Li Fan gained in the illusion realm.</p><p></p><p>Even the depiction in the illusion realm was somewhat crude.</p><p></p><p>Take "Heaven and Earth Taxation," for example. In the illusion realm, it was simply a dual cultivation technique. However, after the calamity of incompatible practices arrived, the effect of rapidly advancing cultivation offered by this technique was nullified.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, this technique had another crucial and mysterious use apart from dual cultivation.</p><p></p><p>That is, locking onto a target and forcibly equalizing the target's luck, cultivation speed, and even personal characteristics like comprehension.</p><p></p><p>This is known as the harmony of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>For true peerless geniuses, this technique naturally seemed quite insignificant. But for someone like Li Fan, it was undoubtedly a profound technique.</p><p></p><p>This was only one of the abilities the initial level of "Heaven and Earth Taxation" could possess.</p><p></p><p>As one progressed in cultivation, just like the name of the technique, the locked-on target could even extend from people to heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"With a mortal body, equate the power of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>"It truly is a true immortal inheritance."</p><p></p><p>The upper limit of "Heaven and Earth Taxation" was extremely high, hinting that it could still be used even after ascending to the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>The only fatal flaw was...</p><p></p><p>The locked-on target would sense the practitioner of the technique.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, this single point greatly diminished the importance of this technique in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>For someone like Li Fan, who preferred to strategize before acting and often calculated in the shadows, exposing oneself constantly to another person was not a wise move.</p><p></p><p>The only potential major use he could think of now was to capture a peerless genius and keep them in check.</p><p></p><p>Then forcibly equalize with them to enhance his own understanding, aptitude, and luck.</p><p></p><p>Having skimmed through "Heaven and Earth Taxation," Li Fan then glanced at "Only I Know the Eternal Secret."</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Senior Sister actually trusted me with this path to enlightenment..."</p><p></p><p>After a moment of thought, Li Fan suddenly came to a realization.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that among all these techniques, this "Only I Know the Eternal Secret" was the most worthless.</p><p></p><p>Because based on the principle of "Unity in Diversity," it had already been monopolized by Zhao Ruoxi.</p><p></p><p>With no way out, and possibly being completely monitored by Senior Sister Zhao throughout the practice process...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan decisively sealed it away and set it aside.</p><p></p><p>Glancing over a few techniques, Li Fan then focused his attention on the two techniques he had seen first.</p><p></p><p>"The Forgetful Canon" and "Record of Three Perils of Ghosts and Gods in the Dark Abyss."</p><p></p><p>"The earlier techniques were from a giant man named Sikong Lin among the Twelve King's Laws."</p><p></p><p>"And these techniques..."</p><p></p><p>The appearances of the twelve distinctive cultivators of the Profound Sky Sect flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Quickly, Li Fan identified the possible sources based on the styles of the techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Sun Xingwang."</p><p></p><p>Because the aura exhibited by these two techniques was truly unique.</p><p></p><p>Take "The Forgetful Canon," for instance. This technique bore some resemblance to the abilities of the former Profound Sky King.</p><p></p><p>Both possessed a similar divine power of "words shape reality."</p><p></p><p>The distinction lay in the fact that the words of the Profound Sky King Xuan Yuanhong manifested on himself.</p><p></p><p>Such as "Giant Body Force" and "Heavenly Way of Maneuver," among others.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, "The Forgetful Canon" influenced all external things.</p><p></p><p>Upon reaching a certain level of cultivation, one could even reshape the entire world according to one's thoughts through the murmurs of the technique.</p><p></p><p>For example, within the technique, there was an example.</p><p></p><p>The hallmark of mastering The Forgetful Canon was to create a fictional character out of thin air through whispered words.</p><p></p><p>As the details of this character became more profound, the character would actually come into existence.</p><p></p><p>And act according to the preset rules.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, there would be no sensitivity towards the creator behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>The astonishing nature of "The Forgetful Canon" left Li Fan amazed repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>However, similar to "Heaven and Earth Taxation," "The Forgetful Canon" also had an extremely potent side effect.</p><p></p><p>That was, every hundred years of cultivation in the technique, the practitioner would completely lose all memories except for the content of "The Forgetful Canon."</p><p></p><p>And any original written records or hints would be actively ignored by the practitioner himself.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the practitioner unaware of this fact.</p><p></p><p>Initiating a new chapter of life every hundred years.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Whoever could invent 'The Forgetful Canon' is undoubtedly a stellar talent."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed lightly, then turned his attention to the last technique.</p><p></p><p>"Record of Three Perils of Ghosts and Gods in the Dark Abyss."</p><p></p><p>This technique was the most unique.</p><p></p><p>It was a summoning technique.</p><p></p><p>Not summoning something from another realm, but summoning the "ghosts" and "gods" from within one's own body.</p><p></p><p>According to the technique's explanation, everyone was born with endless thoughts.</p><p></p><p>These thoughts were like waves on the sea.</p><p></p><p>Most of them were fleeting.</p><p></p><p>But these waves of thoughts made up the vast sea of a person.</p><p></p><p>If every fleeting thought was preserved, nourished day and night, and allowed to grow and develop.</p><p></p><p>Then countless refined thought essences would be born in one's mind.</p><p></p><p>These thoughts would mold themselves into "ghosts" and "gods" according to the nature and content of the thoughts, forming a triumvirate of human, ghost, and god.</p><p></p><p>Due to the fact that these ghosts and gods originated from oneself, all three were interrelated.</p><p></p><p>And as the strength of the person grew, the power of the "ghosts" and "gods" would also expand by a thousandfold.</p><p></p><p>A single thought released would seem like the depths of the netherworld reappearing in the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Enveloped in darkness, with souls roaming freely.</p><p></p><p>Under deliberate indulgence, destroying the world with a single thought and turning all other beings into their own ghosts and gods would be a simple task.</p><p></p><p>This "Record of Three Perils of Ghosts and Gods in the Dark Abyss" did not have any particularly strong side effects.</p><p></p><p>If it needed to be stated, the innumerable whispers of the ghosts and gods that did not exist in one's body served as the only adverse factor.</p><p></p><p>If one's mind was not strong, they might genuinely drive themselves insane.</p><p></p><p>And even with unwavering will, facing the incessant murmurs of countless ghosts and gods day and night would eventually become unbearable.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, the practitioner of this technique would go berserk.</p><p></p><p>Releasing the multitudes of ghosts and gods to obliterate the world.</p><p></p><p>However, when the "Record of Three Perils of Ghosts and Gods in the Dark Abyss" was combined with "The Forgetful Canon," an unexpected effect surfaced.</p><p></p><p>The memory deletion every hundred years would sweep away the negative emotions accumulated by the multitude of ghosts and gods.</p><p></p><p>But these ghosts and gods themselves would not disappear.</p><p></p><p>Even if one forgot the "Record of Three Perils of Ghosts and Gods in the Dark Abyss" technique, cultivating the thought essences of the ghosts and gods had become a bodily instinct.</p><p></p><p>With time passing, one's own strength would constantly increase.</p><p></p><p>"However, I remember Sun Xingwang mentioned that practicing both of these techniques together might have other unforeseen points of rejection."</p>

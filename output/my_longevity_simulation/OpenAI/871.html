        <h1>Chapter 871</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Heaven and earth share the same grief.</p><p></p><p>Not only helping heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Helping these cultivators who are considered allies by heaven and earth will still increase the favor of the mysterious Huang Tian Dao.</p><p></p><p>From a rational perspective, in the mysterious Huang realm, being a lackey of the Tian Dao will definitely not lead to good results. It will only be firmly suppressed by the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals and the Five Elders.</p><p></p><p>Normal cultivators wouldn’t make such a choice.</p><p></p><p>But with the help of Hanzhen, Li Fan can proceed without any worries.</p><p></p><p>Because Li Fan is not really aiming to be a thug for the mysterious Huang Tian Dao.</p><p></p><p>He only needs to deceive her trust.</p><p></p><p>I'm helping you, ultimately you have to lend me some power, right?</p><p></p><p>After all, the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals and the Five Elders are not easy to deal with.</p><p></p><p>As long as he can successfully deceive the remaining power of the mysterious Huang Tian Dao, Li Fan's goal will be achieved.</p><p></p><p>Wanting him to truly merge with the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals and the Five Elders...</p><p></p><p>It's naturally impossible.</p><p></p><p>Once he is Han Zhen, Li Fan doesn't owe anything to anyone!</p><p></p><p>“However, it's necessary to earn the trust of the mysterious Huang Tian Dao step by step, and it will require careful planning."</p><p></p><p>"This is an absolute taboo topic, there are no records to draw from. I can only try it out carefully on my own.”</p><p></p><p>“Speaking of which, provoking the battles between the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals and the Five Elders should count, right?”</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly raised his head, as if his gaze pierced through the Spirit Wood Realm and straight into the sky of the mysterious Huang realm.</p><p></p><p>“No, it won’t work. Obscure, working diligently but never getting the boss’s appreciation.”</p><p></p><p>"Even if you make achievements, if it's not known above, it’s as good as not achieving anything."</p><p></p><p>“Maybe I can use Senior Tablet to communicate with the heavens.”</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly had an idea in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Many of his plans were completed in small worlds like the Spirit Wood Realm and the Cloud Sea.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious Huang Tian Dao may not necessarily know.</p><p></p><p>In the future, he can frequently visit Senior Tablet's place, and whatever achievements he attains, he can share every detail.</p><p></p><p>This way, he can become familiar in front of Senior Tablet and also gain the favor of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>“No, if I personally do this, it might seem too deliberate.”</p><p></p><p>“Well, I can leave this to Lin Ling.”</p><p></p><p>The image of Lin Ling's natural look appeared in front of him, and Li Fan couldn’t help but nod to himself.</p><p></p><p>After a brief moment of contemplation, he planned out two future paths.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan called Tianyang over.</p><p></p><p>Recently, he had been staying in the Spirit Wood Realm, helping Shang Tianci and Oudaozi build the headquarters of the Joint Council.</p><p></p><p>Although he never had a break, Li Fan still felt that Tianyang's strength had improved significantly compared to when they combined forces.</p><p></p><p>"Young Junior Brother, let's have a match."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang looked at Li Fan somewhat suspiciously, then glanced at his own fists.</p><p></p><p>He then shook his head slowly.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly afraid of hurting Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chuckled, a hint of the aura belonging to the Five Elements Great Cave Heaven emanating from him.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang's eyes instantly lit up.</p><p></p><p>Grinning, he seemed pleased with Li Fan's improved strength.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Young Junior Brother. My strength now is no weaker than yours."</p><p></p><p>These words stirred Tianyang's competitive spirit. He immediately seemed eager to try.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked around the Spirit Wood Realm, observing the somewhat formed headquarters of the Joint Council.</p><p></p><p>"Even though the Spirit Wood Realm is not small, it might not withstand our fight."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Li Fan instantly thought of a suitable place.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me."</p><p></p><p>Leaving the Spirit Wood Realm, the two of them traversed the land of the Four Provinces and arrived within the current boundaries of Langxuan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>This prefecture housed a hidden small world named "Soul Yin."</p><p></p><p>It was unknown why all the mortals who migrated into this realm had perished.</p><p></p><p>Only numerous ghostly spirits resembling soul bodies remained, drifting in the world.</p><p></p><p>These soul bodies seemed to be related to spatial forces.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, they were exceptional nourishment for the Rift-Realm Whales.</p><p></p><p>Upon discovering the existence of the Soul Yin Realm, the Rift-Realm Whales occasionally came to prey.</p><p></p><p>When these soul bodies disappeared, they would be naturally regenerated by the earth and heaven.</p><p></p><p>They had become the best food for the naturally cloistered Rift-Realm Whales.</p><p></p><p>Thus, among all the small worlds where the Rift-Realm Whales existed, the Soul Yin Realm was the most prosperous for the development of the Rift-Realm Whale population.</p><p></p><p>The Rift-Realm Whales constantly opened spatial passages, and this Soul Yin Realm was the farthest from the Mysterious Huang Realm.</p><p></p><p>"During the 115th era, an exploration team of the alliance went missing when they ventured into the Soul Yin Realm. Initially, it was thought that they met with an unfortunate fate, but it turned out the distance was too great for even the usual communication methods to work."</p><p></p><p>"The vast void is just right for me and Tianyang to go all out."</p><p></p><p>Thinking so, Li Fan found the entrance to the Soul Yin Realm.</p><p></p><p>After setting up formations to conceal the surroundings, Li Fan flew into it first.</p><p></p><p>An eerie and profound sense washed over him.</p><p></p><p>It was completely different from flying through spatial channels leading to Dalie or Daxuan.</p><p></p><p>A strange oppressive atmosphere engulfed Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Even Tianyang, who was usually slow to react, showed a rare solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"This feeling..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, trying to grasp it.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he somewhat realized, “It's like a mortal in the depths of the sea..."</p><p></p><p>"Is it because it's too far from the Mysterious Huang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"This point wasn't mentioned in the information collected earlier. No wonder none of the members of that exploration team have been seen again since they returned."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that crossing the vast void is not as easy as I imagined."</p><p></p><p>After contemplating for a while, Li Fan temporarily suppressed these thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Feeling that he had gone far enough, he stopped his movement.</p><p></p><p>"Young Junior Brother, please make your move." Li Fan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang nodded, and without further ado, a pressure manifested.</p><p></p><p>Revealing his red-black interweaving Earthly Spirit body.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan instantly felt that the space around him was completely locked.</p><p></p><p>His limbs felt as if they were tethered with heavy shackles, rendering him immobile.</p><p></p><p>"So, this is the power of space."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew that this was Tianyang showing mercy.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the space power would directly act on his body and tear him apart instantly!</p><p></p><p>"Young Junior Brother, I said go all out!" Li Fan's face darkened, speaking seriously.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Then Li Fan felt the space around him grow even more profound.</p><p></p><p>It felt as though he was bitten by an invisible monster.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's head, hands, and feet instantly disappeared into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Leaving only his helpless body floating in the air.</p><p></p><p>If it were an ancient cultivator, this moment would have been synonymous with certain death.</p><p></p><p>But for a New Law cultivator who devours heavenly realms, it was just a trivial injury.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's body instantly exploded into a mist of blood.</p><p></p><p>Yet his voice thundered like a roar, echoing in the surrounding void space of Tianyang.</p>

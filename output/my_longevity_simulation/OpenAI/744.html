        <h1>Chapter 744</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The announcement is titled "The Letter to Immortal Union Cultivators," and the general idea is as follows:</p><p></p><p>"After the unremitting efforts of the Immortal Union cultivators, the complete exploration of the White Mist Barrier in the Xuanhuang Realm has been achieved. This is a great milestone that is worthy of eternal remembrance."</p><p></p><p>"However, the path of immortality is arduous, and there are more challenging and great tasks waiting for everyone ahead."</p><p></p><p>"It is well known that besides the division of domains and the towering White Mist Barrier in the Xuanhuang Realm, there are countless small realms known as Dongtian. "</p><p></p><p>"Currently, the exploration of the White Mist Barrier has been completed. Therefore, it is time to march into these small worlds!"</p><p></p><p>"Bring them all under the rule of the Myriad Immortal Union, realizing the great unification of the Xuanhuang Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Any cultivator who contributes to this will receive a significant amount of merits and contributions."</p><p></p><p>"When a cultivator carries the Xuantian Treasure Mirror and encounters a passage to a Dongtian or a small world, the mirror will issue a warning."</p><p></p><p>"It is important to note that exploring Dongtian and small worlds is different from exploring the White Mist. The danger level may be even more severe. In the White Mist, there are mostly strange and deceased entities. However, in the small worlds, there may be cultivators and species with various extraordinary powers who might resist fiercely."</p><p></p><p>"Nevertheless, there is no need to fear!"</p><p></p><p>"Even if you unfortunately die, the merits and contributions gained during exploration will not disappear. Instead, they will be inherited by the next life along with the True Spirit."</p><p></p><p>"The great unification of the Xuanhuang Realm is destined to be a very long process. But with the fearless spirit of our Immortal Union cultivators, this goal will eventually be achieved!"</p><p></p><p>Other cultivators were either excited or filled with doubts as they read this.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, Xu Bai cursed inwardly, suddenly understanding where the unease in his heart came from.</p><p></p><p>"Fang Zaiji, have you completed setting up the End Plate Array?" Li Fan flew to the exit of Changsheng Valley and asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Li Fan addressed Fang Zaiji by his full name, making him realize the gravity of the situation.</p><p></p><p>Not daring to be negligent, Fang Zaiji replied, "I have done my best. But the power within the End Plate is something we have never encountered before. It will take some time to create the array based on its principles."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly, "There is no time. Update me on the current progress of the array."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji was slightly surprised but quickly complied.</p><p></p><p>Listening while taking out the Disintegration Disc, Li Fan inputted the rudimentary formation into it.</p><p></p><p>The Disintegration Disc emanated a faint light, and numerous scenes quickly flashed before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>After half a day, the images suddenly stopped, and a complete formation appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>As the light faded, Li Fan transferred the formation to Fang Zaiji, Liu San, and the others, who then set it up together.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, luck was on their side as the entrance to Changsheng Valley was relatively hidden within the mist.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, when the formation was set up, no other cultivators had discovered the entrance.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Treasure Mirror sounds like a valuable item." Fang Zaiji, who now understood the situation, greedily thought.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid it might be a potent poison." Jiang Yushan coldly remarked, "I wouldn't want anything that can see through my true self."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji shrugged, "For such a divine object, there's undoubtedly a price to pay for its use. I, however, have no qualms. I have nothing to hide."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, both Li Fan and Jiang Yushan's gaze fell on Fang Zaiji, sending a hint of murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji chuckled, quickly changing the subject, "The activities of the Myriad Immortal Union this time are significant. As far as I know, there are probably tens of thousands of small worlds hidden in the Xuanhuang Realm, not to mention secret realms and Dongtian."</p><p></p><p>"After the great calamity years ago, many sect cultivators sought refuge there. The Myriad Immortal Union's mobilization of cultivators for comprehensive exploration..."</p><p></p><p>He sighed, "One can almost imagine the bloody scenes that will follow soon."</p><p></p><p>Liu San frowned, "Although the power of the small worlds and Dongtian might not be weak, with the existence of the Lifeseeking Mansion in the Xuanhuang Realm, cultivators can be resurrected. How will this work? It can almost be guaranteed that in the end, the small worlds will lose."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps when the Lifeseeking Mansion was established, the Union had already planned for a war against the small worlds." Fang Zaiji nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Listening to their conversation, Li Fan remained silent.</p><p></p><p>In this world, the Union's plans intertwined intricately. Every move had its deeper meaning.</p><p></p><p>So, the question arises - why did the Union go to such lengths, even opening the Tianxuan Treasure Mirror to the public and launching a war against the small worlds?</p><p></p><p>What special significance does the unification of the Xuanhuang Realm hold for the Myriad Immortal Union?</p><p></p><p>Almost instantly, Li Fan thought of the obelisks towering across various places in the Xuanhuang Realm in the previous life.</p><p></p><p>After the unification of the Xuanhuang Realm in the previous life, it seemed like the Heavenly Alliance wanted to break free from the attraction of the Immortal Ruins by pushing in the opposite direction using the countless obelisks.</p><p></p><p>However, in this life, there were no signs of such actions.</p><p></p><p>Not due to lack of power, but possibly because...</p><p></p><p>"The Tianxuan Mirror sees all things in the world. By completely recognizing the small worlds within the White Mist Barrier and upgrading it initially. If it can encompass countless small worlds within its range of reflection..."</p><p></p><p>"It may be possible to take it a step further!"</p><p></p><p>"At that time, perhaps there will be no need for external aid. Relying solely on the power of the Tianxuan Mirror itself, it may lead the Xuanhuang Realm to break free from the attraction of the Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes shimmered, unable to help but consider such a possibility.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, the overall trend is unstoppable. However, I must think about maximizing the benefits from it."</p><p></p><p>In the following days, the experiment was led by Meng Wushi from the Yaowang School.</p><p></p><p>First, he voluntarily detached himself from the connection of the Great Dream Spring and Autumn Array, ensuring that even if his inner state was fully exposed, it would not implicate the Yaowang School.</p><p></p><p>Then he created his own Tianxuan Treasure Mirror, opened the detection function, and kept hovering around the entrance of Changsheng Valley.</p><p></p><p>After maintaining this for a period, he flew away on his own.</p><p></p><p>"Thank goodness it worked. Otherwise, we would probably be in for a tough battle." Fang Zaiji heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"It was also fortunate that I obtained the Terminal Stone Disk that could shield the sensing of the Tianxuan Mirror." Li Fan also expressed his sentiment.</p><p></p><p>Liu San was very pleased, "In the upcoming earth-shattering battle, our Yaowang School can stay out of it. It is truly a stroke of luck. It may be the opportunity for our resurgence."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Yushan also pondered, "Perhaps we can openly join the Myriad Immortal Union through this opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"After all, the Union cannot possibly exterminate all inhabitants of the small worlds, there must be worlds willing to surrender willingly."</p><p></p><p>"We might be able to blend in, whitewash our identities, and benefit from it."</p><p></p><p>()</p>

        <h1>Chapter 974</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Even if he knew that death might await him next, he did not hesitate at all.</p><p></p><p>After all, as the first Law Transmission Master, he had experienced "death" countless times.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had the means left by the Law Transmission Celestial Elder.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Xuanyellow remained indestructible, and the laws set by the Celestial Elder remained unchanged, as one who depended on the Celestial Elder's existence, he would never perish.</p><p></p><p>His state would forever be fixed at the initial time point, and if he wished, he could "return to the origin" at any time.</p><p></p><p>Not only him, even the Realm of Return where he resided was the same.</p><p></p><p>This was a safeguard left by the Law Transmission Celestial Elder for the Xuanyellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>It allowed him to fearlessly resolve various issues that may arise in the Xuanyellow Realm, and amidst continuous deaths, his ability to cope and experience would continuously improve. In handling affairs, he became more and more at ease.</p><p></p><p>And if he encountered something he couldn't handle, he would trap it and bring it back to the Realm of Return.</p><p></p><p>By utilizing the forced restoration state of "returning to the origin," thorough elimination of it could be achieved.</p><p></p><p>The power of "returning to the origin" in the Realm of Return was comprehended by the Law Transmission Celestial Elder after his enlightenment nearly a thousand years ago and reestablishing the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Elder once said to him that even in the face of real immortal obstructions, they could be resolved invisibly over and over again in the process of "returning to the origin."</p><p></p><p>"There is no information left. This situation has only happened twice in the past. New book 69 is out."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that behind this turmoil, it is either the real immortal seal or..."</p><p></p><p>The Law Transmission Master, looking towards the eastern border of the Xuanyellow Realm, snorted coldly and continued on his way.</p><p></p><p>When he encountered a violent deity, the Law Transmission Master immediately subdued it.</p><p></p><p>Then, he sent a wisp of divine consciousness into it.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the fierce-looking deity burst open.</p><p></p><p>The Law Transmission Master furrowed his brows slightly, "Only an empty shell left? Ran so fast."</p><p></p><p>Next, the Law Transmission Master tested more than ten deities in the same manner.</p><p></p><p>All ended the same.</p><p></p><p>"Clearly won, yet still so cautious..."</p><p></p><p>"What is the purpose after all?"</p><p></p><p>This unknown opponent made the Law Transmission Master feel a pressure he hadn't experienced in a long time.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to see a thick black cloud slowly approaching from the horizon.</p><p></p><p>It was going to overshadow the entire sky of the Xuanyellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, let's deal with these anomalies in front of us first."</p><p></p><p>"When they reveal themselves, we'll deal with them accordingly."</p><p></p><p>"If there's really no way..."</p><p></p><p>"Then we'll have to seek help from the Celestial Elder. New book 69 is out."</p><p></p><p>Thinking like this, the Law Transmission Master crushed another deity.</p><p></p><p>After that, instead of continuing to act on his own, he returned to the Realm of Return and issued orders to thoroughly clear out the various demonic anomalies in the headquarters of the Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Demonic forces had become a disaster, rendering the grassroots defense of the Alliance almost paralyzed.</p><p></p><p>To solve the problem quickly and thoroughly, it required influential figures to take the lead.</p><p></p><p>As the first Law Transmission Master, Jiang naturally wouldn't personally intervene.</p><p></p><p>After inquiring among other Law Transmission Masters, only a few were willing to take on this difficult task.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after some consideration, Law Transmission Master Jiang decided to let Law Transmission Master Feng handle the matter.</p><p></p><p>Initially, Law Transmission Master Feng had left a good impression on him. Secondly, Jiang believed that this relatively young Law Transmission Master needed more opportunities for experience.</p><p></p><p>"If the second Realm of Return is established, it might not be impossible to consider him as a successor. As long as he passes the trials," Law Transmission Master Jiang thought.</p><p></p><p>And Law Transmission Master Feng, also known as the Law King of the Black Sky Teachings, Mo Ru Bin, after receiving the order, began issuing orders step by step.</p><p></p><p>With the official orders from the Alliance, those Divine Manifestations and Dao-aligned cultivators who had been hiding and only interested in saving their own lives had to step forward and actively eliminate the rampaging demonic spirits.</p><p></p><p>Under the coordination with the black-clothed cultivators from the era, the nearly one million demonic forces, who had lost their control and were greatly weakened, were gradually destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Like a domino effect, from the sudden eruption to affecting the entire Alliance, the demonic disaster took only half a day.</p><p></p><p>While the Alliance gradually cleared these demonic forces, it took nearly half a month.</p><p></p><p>When all the demonic incarnations were eliminated, the real challenge emerged.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the possessions of the demonic forces, how should those cultivators whose minds had been bewitched be dealt with.</p><p></p><p>As the demonic incarnations were destroyed, these cultivators almost all became imbeciles without consciousness.</p><p></p><p>But with instructions from the highest decision-making level of the Alliance stating that no one should harm the lives of these cultivators without a judgment of guilt, those who had vented their frustrations and killed some cultivators were also severely punished.</p><p></p><p>"Even if they are guilty, until their crimes are pronounced, they are still members of the Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Harming them would be breaking the laws of the Alliance."</p><p></p><p>The words reached this point, naturally there were no cultivators who dared to be disrespectful and massacre those imbecilic cultivators who had lost all resistance.</p><p></p><p>According to the orders, they all escorted them to the Alliance headquarters awaiting a decision.</p><p></p><p>This process lasted for more than ten days.</p><p></p><p>The demonic disaster was finally completely extinguished.</p><p></p><p>The surviving cultivators sighed with admiration for the righteousness of the Alliance.</p><p></p><p>As a reward for those who had contributed during the process of calming the disaster, the Alliance surprisingly generously rewarded them with a substantial amount of contribution points.</p><p></p><p>The rewards far exceeded those of ordinary missions, and the breadth of rewards exceeded everyone's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Even those who had not actively engaged in combat but only provided information about the positions of the demonic forces received a large amount of contribution points.</p><p></p><p>This made the cultivators who had chosen to watch from the sidelines before regret intensely.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators who had received the rewards and suddenly became wealthy rushed into the Heavenly Mystery Mirror, selecting the items they needed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Alliance issued a public announcement stating that they had already identified the cause of the previous demonic disaster outbreak.</p><p></p><p>Almost all of those cultivators were rebelling because the prices of the cultivation techniques were too high, and they couldn't afford the techniques they desired, thus harboring resentment.</p><p></p><p>Over time, they were ultimately bewitched by an evil ancient fierce spirit, becoming its minions.</p><p></p><p>In order to prevent such tragedy from happening again, the Alliance deeply reflected on itself and from this day onwards, all cultivation techniques sold in the Heavenly Mystery Mirror were reduced in price by one-third.</p><p></p><p>The news caused a huge uproar.</p><p></p><p>It must be noted that a one-third price reduction was not a small amount.</p><p></p><p>Especially for the more expensive cultivation techniques, the remaining contribution points would be even more.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the cultivators who now suddenly found themselves rich couldn't help but go crazy.</p>

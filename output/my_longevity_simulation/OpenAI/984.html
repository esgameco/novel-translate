        <h1>Chapter 984</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The golden figure first made a self-deprecating remark, then began to introduce herself, "My original name is Baihua Daoist, the sect master of the Tianlian Sect in the Wansheng Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"But that was thousands of years ago."</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of sadness in Baihua Daoist's tone, "At that time, the [Mie] Incantation suddenly broke out, sweeping across various realms. Although the Wansheng Realm tried to resist with all its might, it still couldn't stop its spread. Helpless, we had no choice but to abandon the realm and flee. We originally wanted to find a safe haven to take shelter, but unexpectedly..."</p><p></p><p>"Wherever it passed, it was all scenes of the end of the world."</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoist's golden figure shimmered slightly, as if being brushed by a gentle breeze, revealing her inner turmoil. Even though so much time had passed, every time she recalled the scenes from back then, waves of turmoil rose in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"The calamities faced by each realm are not the same. In the star regions around our Wansheng Realm, that gray mold surged like a raging sea, engulfing everything in the world. And in some worlds, distorted creatures manifested, completely destroyed in continuous self-destruction, like a bloody purgatory."</p><p></p><p>"If only that was all, we could just run far enough, maybe still find a glimmer of hope. But..."</p><p></p><p>"Inside the Immortal City, there are [True Immortals]," Li Fan said at this moment in a soft voice.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoist glanced at Li Fan and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Outside the Sinking Star Region, there is an invisible barrier that hinders our departure. And inside the Sinking Star Region, there are True Immortals who comprehend the Dao through the [Hunger] Incantation, disregarding the life and death of all beings..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Wait a minute. You just said there are True Immortals comprehending the Dao through the [Hunger] Incantation? What does that mean?" Li Fan's eyes flashed as he asked.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't True Immortals suppressed by the Hunger Incantation?" Li Fan raised his own doubts.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoist was first taken aback, then suddenly understood, "It seems that the daoists in the Xuanhuang Realm know very little about True Immortals, hence some misunderstandings have arisen."</p><p></p><p>"Based on the research of surviving cultivators from our various cultivating realms at that time, the disaster that befell our star regions, including the [Hunger], [Chaos], [Mie], and other immortal seals, should all originate from the same True Immortal."</p><p></p><p>"This True Immortal endowed the world's laws with unparalleled power through writing. With just a few strokes, he could easily destroy a domain and countless cultivation worlds."</p><p></p><p>"So, all the calamities we have suffered were caused by this True Immortal?" Li Fan's eyes flickered as he asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Contrary to expectations, Baihua Daoist shook her head in denial, "Didn't I just say, if that True Immortal had truly intervened, our star regions would have been instantly destroyed. The disasters that erupted, the Hunger and Chaos Incantations, although bringing endless catastrophic disasters, are still not comparable to the means of a True Immortal."</p><p></p><p>"Then..." Li Fan was briefly stunned, but then instantly figured something out.</p><p></p><p>"Counterfeit strokes?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right. After integrating the records about True Immortals passed down from various realms, the surviving cultivators of that time all unanimously concluded this. The immortal seals causing calamities in the lower realms all came from the same person, or rather, Immortal." Baihua Daoist slowly spoke, her tone not filled with hatred but rather with helplessness.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, listening to Baihua Daoist's description of the higher realms beyond immortals, couldn't help but be filled with longing.</p><p></p><p>Information about immortals in the Xuanhuang Realm had long disappeared into the river of history, even the Law Transmitters knew very little about it.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps only the remnants of the Five Elders, the survivors of the inheritance of the Ten Sects of Immortal Dao, still retained some information.</p><p></p><p>To have encountered a survivor of the ancient immortals by chance today, understanding the secrets of the True Immortals, was definitely a significant opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Li Fan did not completely trust Baihua Daoist.</p><p></p><p>He just listened for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoist continued, "The Engraved Dao Immortal has transcended, but perhaps left behind a few true inscriptions."</p><p></p><p>"Back then, the Immortal Realm experienced some kind of catastrophe, the Immortal Path collapsed, and Immortals scattered and fled. These true inscriptions may have been obtained by one of these Immortals."</p><p></p><p>"He copied down the Incantations of Hunger, Chaos, and Disappearance, causing chaos in the world. This must be related to the path he cultivated."</p><p></p><p>"The Chaos and Disappearance destroyed countless cultivating worlds, while the Hunger Incantation was obtained by another Immortal. Perhaps the Hunger Incantation suited the path of this Immortal; he sat at the former Immortal Realm Gateway and comprehended it on the spot."</p><p></p><p>"Remember, for us, tens of thousands of years may seem extremely long, but for Immortals, it's just a period of seclusion."</p><p></p><p>"As for the consequences of his comprehension of the Hunger Incantation..."</p><p></p><p>"We are all ants in his eyes as lower realm cultivators. Why would he care?" Baihua Daoist's words finally revealed some resentment.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan absorbed all of her words and began to ponder slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Are these just your speculations? Is there any substantial evidence?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoist shook her head, but remained very determined, "Those survivors of our group back then, who survived the calamities, were the most powerful individuals from various realms. Based on the remnants of various realms and materials, the deductions drawn..."</p><p></p><p>"Even if not the absolute truth, it's not far from it."</p><p></p><p>"Especially those who copied the seals of the True Immortals and comprehended the Hunger Incantation, they were just at the Immortal Realm. Although their strength utterly surpasses us cultivators, it still didn't reach the incomprehensible level of the Nameless True Immortals." Baihua Daoist's tone carried a sense of pride.</p>

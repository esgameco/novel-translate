        <h1>Chapter 813</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Shang Tiansi was once again affected by Li Fan's "Bloodline Crossing" technique, and he trusted him very much.</p><p></p><p>Who is Li Fan? When he was just an ordinary person, he could easily deceive many people, who would willingly sacrifice themselves for him.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it didn't take much effort for Shang Tiansi to be successfully brainwashed by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Alliance is decaying and unworthy. We cultivators should take it upon ourselves to overthrow it."</p><p></p><p>"Only then will the beautiful era of free cultivation techniques truly arrive!"</p><p></p><p>Shang Tiansi felt a surge of excitement, a sense of mission he had never experienced before.</p><p></p><p>As for what to do after overthrowing the Immortal Alliance, he didn't think about it.</p><p></p><p>Whether they could truly achieve freedom in cultivation techniques was not within his consideration.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Alliance is powerful, and our strength is still very weak. We need to proceed cautiously."</p><p></p><p>"The first thing to do is to unite all forces that can be united. For example, the Mysterious Yellow Daoists, the worlds..."</p><p></p><p>Shang Tiansi's eyes lit up. "An alliance of the myriad realms, brilliant!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to instill various ideas in him.</p><p></p><p>But this process was suddenly interrupted by an inexplicable oppressive atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>Both of them looked up at the distance.</p><p></p><p>Tianlao Mountain, the highest mountain range among the Nine Mountains.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, their line of sight could reach through most of the province, where they suddenly saw countless cultivators emerging at the border line.</p><p></p><p>"That is..." Shang Tiansi's expression turned to shock.</p><p></p><p>The attire of those cultivators was different from that of the Immortal Alliance. They belonged to another major power in the Mysterious Yellow, affiliated with the Five Elders' Association.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, foreign invaders are attacking. I need to..." Shang Tiansi was about to use the Heavenly Scenery Gourd to escape but couldn't find it after searching around. He then remembered that the gourd was still in Li Fan's hands.</p><p></p><p>"Elder!" He was about to say something but was stopped by Li Fan's single hand.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Alliance is decaying. The Five Elders' Association is no good either."</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elders, defying the laws of heaven and earth, manipulating the inhabitants in the territory."</p><p></p><p>"The fiercer their battles, the more advantageous it is for us."</p><p></p><p>"So, while the wolves and tigers fight, we can sit back and watch!" Li Fan's words were very sinister.</p><p></p><p>At first, Shang Tiansi hesitated, but after careful consideration, he ultimately fell silent.</p><p></p><p>When the Five Elders' cultivators appeared on the land of the Nine Mountains, chaos suddenly erupted in various places.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators wearing the Immortal Alliance attire rebelled and attacked the towns of the Nine Mountains.</p><p></p><p>And as time passed, it seemed that the number of rebellious cultivators was increasing.</p><p></p><p>"You see, the Immortal Alliance is losing its support. As long as someone rises up and calls out, there are immediately countless responders!" Li Fan took the opportunity to say.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Shang Tiansi slowly nodded.</p><p></p><p>In reality, the Five Elders' Association was not entirely useless.</p><p></p><p>At least, this surprise attack demonstrated their organizational capability quite well. </p><p></p><p>However, within half a day, a large part of the Nine Mountains had already fallen.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders' army rapidly advanced, taking control of the towns of the Nine Mountains while continuing to march towards the last Tianchang Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The battlefield was chaotic.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Shang Tiansi had been hiding at the top of Tianlao Mountain and had not been discovered by others for a short while.</p><p></p><p>As the most important city in the Nine Mountains, the city of Tianchang not only had a Daoist presiding over it but also the presence of the Ten Thousand Laws Business Association.</p><p></p><p>If the Ten Thousand Laws Business Association lent a hand to help defend, they might have been able to hold out until the Immortal Alliance reinforcements arrived.</p><p></p><p>But evidently, the Ten Thousand Laws Business Association was not inclined to take the initiative.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the ordeal, their personnel never came out to fight.</p><p></p><p>And the Tianchang Daoist, facing the three Daoists sent by the Five Elders' Association for the siege, was already struggling.</p><p></p><p>"However, before we leave, we must leave something behind to prove that we were here."</p><p></p><p>"Sunlight!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan tossed a jade slip over.</p><p></p><p>Following his command, Tianyang took the jade slip and tightly held it in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Then, he suddenly threw it towards the direction of Tianchang Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying the jade slip was not only Tianyang's hand but also his entire palm!</p><p></p><p>After the palm, a red-black tail flame erupted.</p><p></p><p>Increasing its speed even further.</p><p></p><p>Like a shooting star, swiftly flying over the sky of the Nine Mountains, heading straight towards its target.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan patted Shang Tiansi's shoulder, not saying a word but returning the Heavenly Scenery Gourd.</p><p></p><p>Feeling something, Shang Tiansi suddenly understood the other's intentions.</p><p></p><p>With a single thought, a strange ripple enveloped the two of them in an instant.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, their figures disappeared from the top of Tianlao Mountain!</p><p></p><p>Above Tianchang City.</p><p></p><p>The three Daoists besieging the Daoist guardian of Tianchang, the Qingyu Immortal Sovereign, suddenly showed a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>They looked towards a fiery ball rapidly flying towards them.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Initially, they thought it was a hidden attack by the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But upon scanning with their divine senses, they discovered a jade slip hidden within the blaze!</p><p></p><p>Although the contents of the jade slip were not extensive, the information contained in it was substantial.</p><p></p><p>Their divine senses swept through the entire Nine Mountains in an instant, but they found no trace of the person who sent the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"Impressive tactics."</p><p></p><p>The three of them showed a very interested expression.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Taihua Province.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Shang Tiansi suddenly appeared on Taixu Mountain, one of the Ten Branches of Taihua, without any signs.</p><p></p><p>"Your Heavenly Scenery Gourd is indeed exceptionally marvelous."</p><p></p><p>"It seems to use the power of the veins to achieve instant teleportation?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered the process of space travel just now, marveling.</p><p></p><p>"No, rather than the power of the veins, it seems more like directly using the power of the Mysterious Yellow Realm to achieve location transformation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly remembered the scene of Mr. Bai "strolling" before.</p><p></p><p>He had a vague feeling.</p><p></p><p>Although Mr. Bai had fallen, the various "abilities" existing in the Mysterious Yellow Realm did not disappear because of that but were distributed among various so-called geniuses to inherit.</p><p></p><p>"But even with the integration of various wonders of the Mysterious Yellow and Mr. Bai, he is not a match for the Transmission Daoist."</p><p></p><p>"Let alone these geniuses."</p><p></p><p>"At most, they are only good resources in the eyes of the Transmission Daoist!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan delved into the thoughts of the Daoist of Transmission.</p><p></p><p>However, Shang Tiansi did not notice this and continued to boast about his Twin Sacred Gourds to Li Fan, "I have a pair of magical gourds by my side. One purple and one cyan."</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you've seen the cyan one, capable of recording and teleporting to different locations."</p><p></p><p>"As for this purple gourd..."</p>

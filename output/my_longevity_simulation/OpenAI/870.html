        <h1>Chapter 870</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Relying solely on himself, Li Fan clearly could not achieve this step.</p><p></p><p>Drawing on the existing achievements of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance and the Five Elders' Association, and then innovating on top of them, there might be a chance to break through the current situation.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how the chosen Immortal is planning to proceed."</p><p></p><p>"Even if the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance had ill intentions from the beginning, until the truth is revealed, they are still the highly anticipated Immortal Chosen Ones, the hope of the alliance."</p><p></p><p>"They should be able to play the role of an inside man."</p><p></p><p>Thinking like this, Li Fan replied to the Five Elders' Association.</p><p></p><p>Without revealing the existence of the senior in slate, he only claimed that he received an urgent notice and had to cancel this meeting due to the risk of exposure.</p><p></p><p>As for the problem, it must have originated from the side of the Five Elders' Association.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also asked them to investigate thoroughly; it must have been infiltrated by spies from the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Although it was made up on the spot, Li Fan didn't really care.</p><p></p><p>As for spies, as long as they investigate, they will surely be found.</p><p></p><p>For now, putting aside the matters of the Five Elders' Association, Li Fan calmed his mind, focusing on the Five Elements Origin Cave within his body.</p><p></p><p>He had previously thought that this Five Elements Cave was naturally evolved from the Xuanhuang Realm and had no fears.</p><p></p><p>However, through the senior in the slate, he learned that this was a creation of the ***One Origin Sect*** thousands of years ago...</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's cautious nature, he definitely wanted to double-check. Thankfully, after a careful examination, there were no remnants of the ***One Origin Sect*** left in the Five Elements Great Cave.</p><p></p><p>This made Li Fan somewhat relieved.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Xuanhuang Realm is treacherous, and any potential threats must be treated with caution.</p><p></p><p>"Now that the Yuanying stage is complete, the next step is to look towards Nascent Divinity."</p><p></p><p>"The changes of the world's origin..."</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's mind, he instantly recalled the scene of Mr. Bai wandering through various places in Xuanhuang, integrating the changes of Xuanhuang into his own cave.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to Mr. Bai, most of the available ***Will of Genesis*** in the Xuanhuang Realm within the past century was clear to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"With the ***Sit Immortal's Principles*** and the continuous feedback of the members of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Realms for my cultivation, there is hardly any need to worry about the accumulation of cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"The only thing to worry about is the existence of the Heavenly Calamity and how to harmoniously accommodate several different changes of the Will of Genesis."</p><p></p><p>After achieving the Nascent Divinity stage through the Five Elements Great Cave, the normal method of attaining Divinity no longer interested Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Even the general Souls of the Heaven and Earth did not pique Li Fan's interest.</p><p></p><p>Too weak!</p><p></p><p>It's not that Li Fan's mindset has become inflated; it's just a fact.</p><p></p><p>Even though he has not exerted all his strength so far, the immense power derived from the Five Elements Great Cave within him has already placed Li Fan far beyond the realm of ordinary Nascent Divinity cultivators.</p><p></p><p>During his Foundation Establishment stage, he was able to compete with Nascent Divinity cultivators using various means.</p><p></p><p>Now, who knows how many times his strength has increased. Crushing an ordinary Nascent Divinity cultivator is no more difficult than crushing an ant.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with his possession of the Five Elements Extinction Sword, the Seven-Color Jade Illusion Light, and even the secret of ***Chaos*** within him.</p><p></p><p>Entities like Vermilion Blaze and Black Mire, from the Souls of Heaven and Earth, are definitely not his opponents.</p><p></p><p>Only the level of existence like Mo Sha would pose a slightly tricky situation for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>However, it should not be a big problem for him to retreat unscathed before such adversaries.</p><p></p><p>With the Nascent Divinity stage achieved, how could Li Fan possibly be willing to follow the ordinary path of attaining Divinity and uniting the Dao, like Bai Mr. Bai, integrating all the changes of the Origin of Genesis into himself, transforming the Nascent Divinity Cave into an inner world, and subsequently converting many Souls of the Heaven and Earth, and then seizing the original power of the Xuanhuang world on a large scale.</p><p></p><p>This is the most ideal method for expanding one's strength.</p><p></p><p>For now, not considering if such an approach could be an enemy to the orthodox teachings.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan believes that if he can truly reach that level, at the very least, when facing an ordinary Longevity Heavenly Venerable, he would not be at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, if I can really find a way to escape from the Xuanhuang Realm. My cultivation, within the same realm in other immortal cultivation worlds, would definitely be peerless."</p><p></p><p>Cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm swallow the heavens and devour the earth. They are inherently more formidable than conventional cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan far surpasses ordinary New Doctrine cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Comparatively, he is truly far superior.</p><p></p><p>However, though the ideal is good, a problem looms in front of Li Fan that urgently needs to be resolved.</p><p></p><p>He naturally will not encounter any resistance.</p><p></p><p>But who is Li Fan after all?</p><p></p><p>Why would the heavenly path of the Xuanhuang Realm allow him to do so?</p><p></p><p>Ordinary cultivators who practice New Doctrines have already incurred the wrath of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>If he really follows through as Li Fan imagines, it is almost equivalent to peeling, extracting marrow, and sucking out bone marrow.</p><p></p><p>It is simply the enemy of the heavenly laws.</p><p></p><p>How can one transform the changes of the Will of Genesis and the Souls of Heaven and Earth for their own use under such a situation where heaven and earth are fundamentally opposed?</p><p></p><p>Even if one can forcibly absorb one or two, a rebellion is inevitable.</p><p></p><p>"Unless..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>For Li Taishi, who is knowledgeable and well-travelled, this is not an unsolvable problem. In almost an instant, he thought of a solution.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the heavenly laws of the Xuanhuang Realm despise cultivators so much.</p><p></p><p>It is nothing but because cultivators need to seize resources from the Xuanhuang Realm in order to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>As long as this point does not change, there will never be a possibility of reconciliation between the two sides.</p><p></p><p>However, now, the Xuanhuang Realm is at an absolute disadvantage in the ongoing battle...</p><p></p><p>This gives Li Fan a slight chance.</p><p></p><p>That is, to realign himself and choose to stand on the side of the heavenly laws of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan vaguely remembered that when he brought back the remains of Qian Hong from the Great Mystery to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>An omen of catastrophe that should have appeared at the moment of death occurred once before without reason.</p><p></p><p>And after Li Fan finished all this, he also felt that there had been some special changes in his body.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he was not able to understand the meaning behind this.</p><p></p><p>But after so many years, having perused countless cultivation books, Li Fan already knew the reason for this.</p><p></p><p>Although such incidents are rare in the Xuanhuang Realm, they have occurred.</p><p></p><p>There are cultivators who, despite being forced by the changes in the principles of heaven and earth to practice New Doctrines, have overall beneficial effects on heaven and earth throughout their careers.</p><p></p><p>For example...</p><p></p><p>Helping to slaughter New Doctrine cultivators, accelerating their return to the path within the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Although in the eyes of cultivators, these people are undisputedly evil cultivators. Whether it is the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance or the Five Elders' Association, they are subject to severe crackdowns.</p><p></p><p>But in the eyes of heaven and earth, these are indeed righteous individuals.</p><p></p><p>Good cultivators standing on the side of heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is just an extreme example. Apart from slaughtering cultivators, replenishing the deficiencies of heaven and earth, or assisting the Souls of the Heaven and Earth in fulfilling their duties...</p><p></p><p>All of these actions can increase the favor of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>After the favorability reaches a certain level, even when a cultivator falls, heaven and earth will still manifest a phenomenon.</p>

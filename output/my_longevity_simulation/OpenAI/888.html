        <h1>Chapter 888</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Within a month, a total of five appearances occurred.</p><p></p><p>There was even one instance where there was only a two-day interval between them.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Fan thought that by using such a big move, the thirty-three immortal candidates would have to pay a significant price at the very least.</p><p></p><p>However, judging from this frequency, it seemed that it wasn’t as he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Each time the Dharma image appeared in different states at the Five Elders Assembly, after forcing some of the celestial nobles to take action, it quietly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>What was more terrifying was that each time this fleeting Dharma image appeared, it seemed to become more "vivid."</p><p></p><p>Starting from just opening her eyes at the beginning.</p><p></p><p>And then slowly trying to make a palm strike later on.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma image was progressing at an almost visible speed.</p><p></p><p>It was hard to imagine, if she tried enough times, whether she would become as powerful as a real immortal.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to reach the level of an immortal. Even if it's just one-tenth as powerful, it would be enough to deal with the Five Elders Assembly."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Five Elders Assembly is so anxious. Sending messages consecutively, wanting me to help investigate the background of the thirty-three immortal candidates."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sneered, "Unfortunately, I am truly powerless this time."</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the Five Elders Assembly, Li Fan shifted his focus to the new guest in the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Currently being led by Shang Tianci to tour various places in the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was slightly younger than Shang Tianci, his somewhat naive face occasionally showed a hint of mischief. </p><p></p><p>"I say, Tianci, the scenery in this little world is nice. But calling it the 'Worlds Union' is a bit of an exaggeration, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>The new arrival was none other than Yan Fangzhou, brought here by Shang Tianci at great effort.</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou said disdainfully, "The so-called Worlds Union, and just this few people? It really was an excitement for nothing. I thought I could finally do something meaningful."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid even toppling the Immortal Alliance is not enough. Just mentioning the martial arts competition and law enforcement hall in the Stone Lin Region, you wouldn't be able to handle it, right?"</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci blushed, about to retort.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, a cold voice rang out sharply, "Young in age, but big in words. Let them try?"</p><p></p><p>This voice was as if the wrath of heaven and earth, echoing constantly in this corner of the realm.</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou's face slightly changed as he attempted to identify the owner of the voice.</p><p></p><p>But to his surprise, he found himself abruptly isolated, with Shang Tianci next to him disappearing.</p><p></p><p>The whole expanse seemed to be infinitely expanding, and he felt insignificant in this vast expanse, sensing the immense and endless sky and land.</p><p></p><p>And because of what he had just said, it seemed to have offended the heavens and earth here.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the changing sky, an unimaginable sense of killing intent engulfed him.</p><p></p><p>"Playing tricks!" Yan Fangzhou was, after all, a genius of his generation, not so easily frightened.</p><p></p><p>"Break!" </p><p></p><p>A shadowy black flame suddenly appeared behind him. </p><p></p><p>In the instant the black flame emerged, the turbulent sky and earth seemed to freeze.</p><p></p><p>A sense of annihilation emanated from the black flame.</p><p></p><p>The murderous intent of the heavens and earth froze, plunging into annihilation.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>The surrounding scenery shattered like broken glass.</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou couldn't help but show a hint of triumph on his face.</p><p></p><p>But soon, his momentary satisfaction disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Because what appeared in front of him next was the vast expanse of sky and land, brimming with the same boundless killing intent!</p><p></p><p>As if what he broke was just a layer of illusion!</p><p></p><p>"No matter how many layers you have, break them all for me!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou snorted coldly, and the black flames shot into the sky like a meteor.</p><p></p><p>Wherever it passed, the space froze and entered a static state.</p><p></p><p>Then it was brutally crushed by the black trajectory.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings suddenly changed again, and the original scene reappeared.</p><p></p><p>The momentum of the black long lines did not diminish as they rushed around, seemingly shattering countless layers of heaven and earth in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>No matter how many layers he shattered, the scenery outside, surrounding him, remained the same.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't see the end at all, so he could only be trapped in this maze forever.</p><p></p><p>After who knows how long, Yan Fangzhou's original confidence slowly began to fade from his face.</p><p></p><p>He went from being confident to becoming extremely anxious and disbelieving.</p><p></p><p>When he finally realized that he couldn’t break through the blockade of this time and space, his expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"If you have the guts, come out and fight fair and square!"</p><p></p><p>"Thinking of impressing people with such tricks?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou faced the heavens and earth that confined him and declared loudly.</p><p></p><p>But to his disappointment, it seemed like the other party didn't hear him at all.</p><p></p><p>There was no response.</p><p></p><p>A flash of fierceness passed through Yan Fangzhou's eyes as he took out a golden talisman emanating threads of thunderous light.</p><p></p><p>He threw it into the air.</p><p></p><p>Much to his surprise, the talisman that had always been effective in the past, the 'Space-breaking Talisman,' had lost its effect at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Instead of breaking open space and creating an escape route, it seemed to be lost and aimlessly spinning in the air.</p><p></p><p>Next, Yan Fangzhou tried out all his life-saving methods one by one.</p><p></p><p>None worked!</p><p></p><p>Now, Yan Fangzhou was truly panicked.</p><p></p><p>"I admit defeat!"</p><p></p><p>"I shouldn't have boasted! The Worlds Union is indeed well-deserved!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou suppressed the viciousness in his eyes and shouted towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>"I ask the senior to allow me to join the Union!"</p><p></p><p>The sky remained quiet, with no reaction at all.</p><p></p><p>Yan Fangzhou was at a loss, thinking that the other party hadn't heard him, so he repeated his plea several times.</p><p></p><p>The result remained the same.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci looked at Yan Fangzhou, who suddenly stood still, feeling somewhat strange.</p><p></p><p>He shouted several times, but the other party seemed as if he hadn't heard a thing.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that he finally realized something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>Around Yan Fangzhou, there seemed to be an invisible barrier enclosing him.</p><p></p><p>Not only could outsiders not touch him, but he also seemed unaware of the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"Senior..." Shang Tianci looked at Li Fan, who suddenly appeared, and said weakly.</p><p></p><p>"The boy is good, just needs some tempering. Let him cool off for a year or so." Li Fan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>In his hand, a black flame flickered and danced unpredictably.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly trying to break free from Li Fan's grasp.</p><p></p><p>But it was tightly held.</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci didn't dare to argue and just nodded.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at Yan Fangzhou, who was trapped by his infinite methods, and rubbed his chin.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Yan Fangzhou was instantly transferred outside the Union's Black Jade Gate.</p><p></p><p>As if he was just a figurine, he was placed in a fitting posture.</p><p></p><p>"When he's about to collapse, then let him out."</p><p></p><p>"It'll be convenient for his training."</p>

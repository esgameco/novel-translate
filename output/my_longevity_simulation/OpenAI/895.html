        <div class="content">
            <p>Causing everyone present to lose track of the Xuantian Master.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, besides the Heavenly Lord, the only ones who can influence and control the Tianxuan Mirror are their Xuantian Sect!"</p><p></p><p>This thought flashed through the young man's mind.</p><p></p><p>After scanning around and not finding any trace of the other party, the young man's heart sank slightly, about to give the order to pursue.</p><p></p><p>However, he suddenly noticed something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"I have already set up the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths formation in advance here. If the formation is not broken, he absolutely has no possibility of escaping."</p><p></p><p>"Meaning, he is still here?!"</p><p></p><p>The young man then commanded the group of black-robed cultivators to scan the space again.</p><p></p><p>To the young man's surprise, they could not find any trace of the disappeared Xuantian Master of the Xuantian Sect at all!</p><p></p><p>The young man's face as a transmitter of the law turned somewhat grim.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, they are not easy to deal with. No wonder they survived from the joint annihilation of the Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao."</p><p></p><p>The young man's gaze continued to scan back and forth in the space.</p><p></p><p>"Where exactly are you hiding?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his gaze focused.</p><p></p><p>Landing on the group of black-robed cultivators under his command.</p><p></p><p>The young man faintly felt that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>"How many people did I bring along this time?"</p><p></p><p>A question involuntarily surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>However, what shocked him was that with such a simple question...</p><p></p><p>He couldn't remember at all!</p><p></p><p>Having lived in seclusion for who knows how many years, this kind of thing happening to him was simply unimaginable!</p><p></p><p>"So, this is the cunning aspect of Xuantian Sect's techniques..."</p><p></p><p>The young man narrowed his eyes, various rumors about the ancient Xuantian Sect emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Realizing that the opponent was hiding among this group of black-robed cultivators under his command, the young man then ordered them to verify each other's identities.</p><p></p><p>Although the young man was not very familiar with the vast majority of black-robed cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But these cultivators definitely knew each other well.</p><p></p><p>However, what the young man never expected was that after verifying each other.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't find anyone with a mismatched identity.</p><p></p><p>Each person's information was flawless.</p><p></p><p>Even in their minds, they had memories of their past interactions with each other.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this point, the young man's complexion became extremely unsightly.</p><p></p><p>At this point in time, even if he was unwilling, he had to admit.</p><p></p><p>He might have overstepped this time.</p><p></p><p>As one of the earliest to follow the Transmitter Heavenly Lord, and one of those who helped overturn the Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>The young man actually didn't pay much attention to this so-called Xuantian Master of the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Transmitter Heavenly Lord and his followers were the defeated who overthrew the Xuantian Sect.</p><p></p><p>No matter how strong the Xuantian Sect was, what could they do?</p><p></p><p>So, for the sake of monopolizing unique skills, he had come this time without informing other Transmitters.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he had now fallen into such a dilemma.</p><p></p><p>The young man's expression kept changing.</p><p></p><p>And now he had two choices, one was to inform the headquarters of the Immortal Alliance and provide the list of black-robed cultivators who participated in this operation.</p><p></p><p>With a simple comparison, the hidden Xuantian Master could be found.</p><p></p><p>But doing so would definitely alert other Transmitters.</p><p></p><p>And could even invite ridicule.</p><p></p><p>After some consideration, the young man made another choice.</p><p></p><p>He pointed at one of the black-robed cultivators at random and coldly said, "You, take your own life."</p><p></p><p>With a swift and forceful pat on their heads, their breath vanished in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Their body also turned into dust, as if dissolving into the air.</p><p></p><p>Only a green light wrapped around something, breaking through the air.</p><p></p><p>The young man's face showed no emotion as he looked at the next black-robed cultivator.</p><p></p><p>In the gaze of the young man's deadly stare, one by one, the black-robed cultivators took their own lives.</p><p></p><p>What was eerie was that the phenomenon of falling cultivators, which should have occurred in the sky, never appeared from beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>A total of thirty-five black-robed cultivators came with him.</p><p></p><p>Now, twenty-six had taken their own lives, but the hidden Xuantian Master was still not found.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that my luck is so bad?"</p><p></p><p>"Or did I judge wrongly?"</p><p></p><p>The young man's face became extremely grim.</p><p></p><p>But at this point, there was no room for regret.</p><p></p><p>Determined, he continued to give the command for suicide like a gambler on a losing streak.</p><p></p><p>Until...</p><p></p><p>Only one black-robed cultivator was left in the field.</p><p></p><p>Just like the ones before, he raised his hand and was about to strike his own head forcefully.</p><p></p><p>But just before his head burst, he stopped.</p><p></p><p>Lowering his hand slowly, he looked somewhat mockingly at the young transmitter in front of him. "Is this the current ruling cultivation organization?"</p><p></p><p>"Treating subordinates as mere grass..."</p><p></p><p>"You say our Xuantian Sect is ruthless and unjust, but in my eyes, you are far worse."</p><p></p><p>The young man was not provoked by Li Chen's words.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, those black-robed cultivators were merely resources that could be regenerated at any time.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the death of dozens.</p><p></p><p>Even if hundreds or thousands died, he wouldn't feel a thing.</p><p></p><p>The young man would never believe that it was his luck that caused the last person he randomly pointed at to be the Xuantian Master.</p><p></p><p>This should be due to the inducement of the opponent's cunning technique.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Li Chen did not deny it.</p><p></p><p>"Dark magic?"</p><p></p><p>Li Chen snorted, "These are the supreme lineages of the Dao, the authentic Immortal Sects! How can people like you see through them!"</p><p></p><p>The young man's identity was extremely noble.</p><p></p><p>For thousands of years, no one had dared to speak so arrogantly in front of him!</p><p></p><p>Especially with the deep, genuine disdain in the opponent's eyes, it made the young man unable to contain his anger.</p><p></p><p>"Now, it's just the two of us here. Let's see what other tricks you can play!"</p><p></p><p>There was a strong killing intent in the young man's tone, his clothes moving without wind.</p><p></p><p>The space sealed by the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths formation suddenly lit up with twinkling starlight.</p><p></p><p>Then, like the arrival of nightfall, stars covered the sky.</p><p></p><p>Countless beams of starlight shone, like sharp arrows, aiming to pierce through the Xuantian Master!</p><p></p><p>Faced with the young man's sudden attack, Li Chen seemed to be stunned, motionless, standing still.</p><p></p><p>Just as countless starlight was about to hit, ready to pierce through, the young man faintly felt that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>But it was already too late.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, numerous small holes appeared on the young man's body.</p><p></p><p>Blood gushed out, and he was pierced through his heart by his own starlight!</p><p></p><p>Under the thousands of starlights, the young man's body turned into a puddle of mud.</p><p></p><p>After a short moment, with a slight wriggling.</p><p></p><p>A whole body emerged from the void.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>The young man looked at the black-robed cultivator in front of him, finally feeling a sense of fear rising in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It was an emotion he hadn't tasted in a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Me?"</p><p></p><p>"Am I not you?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the young man, the black-robed cultivator showed a slightly eerie smile.</p><p></p><p>A sense of confusion arose in the young man's eyes.</p>

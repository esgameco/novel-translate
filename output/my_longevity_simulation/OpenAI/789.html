            <p>"Dongfang this person..."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>After slowly retracting his gaze, Li Fan quietly arrived at a rather inexpensive stone forest.</p><p></p><p>Located in the Zhu Huai Zhou, the resources here were poor. Moreover, it had been thoroughly explored and found to have no small worlds or entrances to caves. Therefore, there were very few cultivators coming here now.</p><p></p><p>It was just right for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Similar to Dongfang Yao, he also needed to set up some arrangements throughout the Xuan Huang Realm in the upcoming period.</p><p></p><p>After arriving at a depth of three thousand feet underground, he opened up a space.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took out a pile of broken puppet parts.</p><p></p><p>They were very similar to the guard puppets in the Tianyang Cave Mansion, all made of porcelain, with a black and red exterior.</p><p></p><p>Upon closer inspection, on each puppet part, those red threads seemed to be a part of a certain character stroke.</p><p></p><p>This was Li Fan's method of dismantling the chaotic script!</p><p></p><p>He set up an array and placed the puppet core in the center.</p><p></p><p>Then he proceeded to place the puppet parts in a disorderly manner in the array.</p><p></p><p>"When a specific condition is triggered, the array will activate the puppet core to complete the reorganization in an instant."</p><p></p><p>"The chaotic script is intact."</p><p></p><p>"Then, the puppet will self-destruct, serving as the energy to cast spells."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way in his mind, Li Fan finished placing the puppets in a disorderly manner.</p><p></p><p>The threads of silver light in the array passed through the puppet parts acting as nodes, connecting the whole array.</p><p></p><p>With a gentle touch, the array fell silent. There was no leakage of any breath.</p><p></p><p>"This place is all set up."</p><p></p><p>"Although it is a bit crude, the more so, the less likely it is to be discovered."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded with some satisfaction, then left quietly without even concealing the array.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had crafted no less than a thousand chaotic script puppets.</p><p></p><p>Even if some were occasionally discovered, there would be no significant losses, and it would not affect the overall situation.</p><p></p><p>After drilling out from underground, Li Fan looked around to make sure no one was following him.</p><p></p><p>He then buried more chaotic script puppets in two other locations in Zhu Huai Island.</p><p></p><p>After making sure everything was arranged properly, he headed towards the neighboring Shouyi Zhou.</p><p></p><p>He planned to bury three to four puppets in every state of the Wan Xian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"When the chaotic scripts are set off, even the Longevity Heavenly Venerable will be attracted and have their visions concealed."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's actions were quick.</p><p></p><p>After he systematically completed setting up the thirty-fifth state, he suddenly stopped his movements.</p><p></p><p>"Is it finally time to advance to the Nascent Soul stage?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked up into the distance.</p><p></p><p>The journey of the Nascent Divine Embryo Xu Bai through the Xuan Huang Realm finally came to an end at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The last transformation he absorbed into his own paradise was the Heavenly Spirit Evolving Flower.</p><p></p><p>"I once thought that the Heavenly Spirit Flower, tainted by malice and no longer beautiful, would eventually reappear in the world."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the self-recovery ability of this Xuan Huang world is truly extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>As the Nascent Divine Embryo Xu Bai absorbed this change in the world, a scene of blossoming flowers unfolded in his paradise like a gentle spring breeze.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan, who was far away in a different place, seemed to smell the fragrance of the flowers from the Nascent Divine Embryo Xu Bai's paradise.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the last piece of the puzzle had been completed.</p><p></p><p>The entire paradise finally elevated to the level of a small world.</p><p></p><p>A strange energy began to circulate within the paradise.</p><p></p><p>From the sky to all things, and then to the earth.</p><p></p><p>It repeated in a cycle.</p><p></p><p>A faint rumbling sound came from deep within the earth.</p><p></p><p>With the sound of rain, wind, the chirping of insects and birds within the paradise, they all together formed a grand and lively symphony.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan seemed to see the continuous expansion and elevation of the paradise in the future.</p><p></p><p>Although no other cultivator noticed his presence, some cultivators sensed the subtle changes in the Heavenly Spirit Zhou caused by him.</p><p></p><p>For example, Sun Qi, who was reporting his progress in cultivating the Inverse Reversal of the Universe Record to Sun Liancheng, suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the sky outside the house.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" Sun Liancheng also looked in the direction of Sun Qi's gaze but found nothing unusual.</p><p></p><p>Sun Qi frowned, and after a long while, he shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe it was just my illusion."</p><p></p><p>"Just a moment ago, I seemed to feel the world reviving."</p><p></p><p>"But it was only for an instant."</p><p></p><p>"Now that feeling has disappeared."</p><p></p><p>Sun Qi said slowly and deliberately. It was evident from his hesitant eyes that it was not as simple as just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>"Revival of the world..." Sun Liancheng squinted his eyes, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>And through the Indiscriminate Killing Mechanism, feeling the images coming from Sun Qi, Li Fan felt a sense of solemnity.</p><p></p><p>Only he knew that Sun Qi's intuition was correct.</p><p></p><p>The revival of the Heavenly Spirit Zhou, which had been drawn out by the Nascent Divine Embryo Xu Bai, was infused into his own paradise.</p><p></p><p>Without this transformational force, it would take a considerable amount of time for the Heavenly Spirit Zhou to return to its original prosperous state.</p><p></p><p>The force of revival in the Heavenly Spirit Zhou was slightly different from that of the Altocumulus Sea.</p><p></p><p>The Altocumulus Sea represented a creative change from life to death, from destruction to rebirth.</p><p></p><p>While the Heavenly Spirit Zhou experienced a normal cycle of life from desolation to prosperity.</p><p></p><p>With this change, the paradise within the Nascent Divine Embryo Xu Bai also completed its transformation into a small world.</p><p></p><p>Through the shared body, Li Fan could now fully witness the scenery of this newly born small world.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual sense quickly scanned, overlooking the vibrant land below.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a familiar feeling surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"This distribution of terrain..."</p><p></p><p>To confirm his thoughts, he promptly identified several iconic mountain ranges and water systems.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed. Exactly the same."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan trembled inexplicably.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"The scenery of the ancient Xuan Huang Realm?!"</p><p></p><p>After reading Ximen Yu's work, Li Fan understood the difference in terrain between the ancient and current Xuan Huang Realm.</p><p></p><p>By removing the white mist barriers and reassembling the disturbed states, the original appearance of the ancient Xuan Huang Realm was restored!</p><p></p><p>This was also what the Nascent Divine Embryo Xu Bai had been doing during this period!</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary Nascent Soul cultivators rely on a state or a single change."</p><p></p><p>"But the Nascent Divine Embryo Xu Bai, on the other hand, is using..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shuddered.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuan Huang Evolution!"</p><p></p><p>"By simulating the changes that will happen in the Xuan Huang Realm within the body's paradise."</p><p></p><p>"Without the interference of other cultivators or the Longevity Heavenly Venerable, the natural evolution of the Xuan Huang Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>The more Li Fan thought about it, the more he felt an inexplicable shock.</p><p></p><p>"Without being a manifestation of the Heavenly Dao and receiving support from the world itself, it is simply impossible to achieve this!"</p><p></p><p>"Even if I keep trying continuously, it would be out of reach!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan realized.</p><p></p><p>Although he had advanced to the Nascent Soul stage, there was not the slightest change in the breath emanating from the Nascent Divine Embryo Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>He stood quietly in the void like an ordinary person.</p>

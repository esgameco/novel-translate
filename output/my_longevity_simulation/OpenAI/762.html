        <h1>Chapter 762</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>A woman in a light purple gown was called over and given instructions shortly after.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then learned that he had become a middle-level guest of Xuan's family.</p><p></p><p>The initial merit level of Wanxian Alliance has been raised to level thirty-five.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a new privilege was unlocked: once every hundred years, he could freely use the Tianxuan Mirror to deduce and enhance one of his supernatural abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Don't let the power go to waste. If not used, it will expire. Brother Li can take this opportunity to further enhance the power of the 'Thread-Cutting Life-Ending' supernatural ability. Although it already seems very powerful when experienced, it definitely has room for improvement, not yet perfect." Shuofeng moved his body, and his bones made a crackling sound. He seemed to notice Li Fan's distraction and reminded him aloud.</p><p></p><p>"Once you advance further, let's have another joyful battle!" Among peers, there were very few who could keep up with his cultivation progress. It often didn't take long before they were left behind, unable to fight anymore. Qualified opponents like Li Fan were rare.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could even occasionally surprise him, which made Shuofeng very satisfied with Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what the difference is between the deducing supernatural ability function and what is provided in the Tianxuan Treasure Mirror? In the 'Sitting and Discussing Dao,' I once tried to deduce the sequel of supernatural abilities with the help of the Tianxuan Mirror. But it was too costly, a bottomless pit. I had to give up halfway." Li Fan asked as he looked at the prompt coming from the Tianxuan Mirror in the field.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianxuan Treasure Mirror is just a branch of Tianxuan. Although it offers various functions that are beyond words for ordinary cultivators, compared to the true power of the Tianxuan Mirror, it is still significantly weaker." Shuofeng chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"For the same type of supernatural ability, there is still a qualitative difference between what the Tianxuan Treasure Mirror and the Tianxuan Mirror deduce. Although they are not vastly different, there is a definitive gap in quality."</p><p></p><p>"However..." Shuofeng's smiling face suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>"That is just the current difference between the Tianxuan Treasure Mirror and the Tianxuan Mirror. After a while..."</p><p></p><p>"It's hard to say."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe, by then, any Mirror under the heavens will be no different from its original form." Shuofeng's expression became inexplicable, and he seemed to recall something, his demeanor turning somewhat serious.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, however, understood the implication in Shuofeng's words.</p><p></p><p>His heart suddenly raced.</p><p></p><p>So, this particular privilege of merit level thirty-five was actually about using the Tianxuan Mirror itself to deduce the follow-up of supernatural abilities!</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that mean he finally had a chance to see the true Tianxuan Mirror again?</p><p></p><p>The last time he saw it was during the training process of building the Tianxuan Locking Spirit.</p><p></p><p>In the vast space filled with black and white lines, including Li Fan and other students, they had a close look at the birth and sealing of the "Tianxuan Newborn Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"In this world, the Tianxuan Mirror has completed its initial transformation. I don't know what changes may happen next." Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Shuofeng had come back from his contemplation and added a reminder, "As for the deducing supernatural ability in the 'Sitting and Discussing Dao' section..."</p><p></p><p>"It's best if you don't attempt it in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Even I, back when I was young and daring, ventured to try my luck. But now, being wiser, I don't want to waste time and effort anymore." Shuofeng surprisingly sighed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, taken aback, shook his head, "I didn't expect there to be such a trick in this. If I had known earlier, I wouldn't have taken the risk."</p><p></p><p>"I almost got chopped up by Brother Shuofeng back then, knowing that I am not someone blessed by luck." Li Fan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of how they almost met their end when they first met, Shuofeng also found it amusing and burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Brother Shuofeng, do you have the Tianxuan Treasure Mirror with you?" Li Fan suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>"Recently, there have been rumors circulating that the Immortal Alliance is pushing for all cultivators to own their own treasure mirror?"</p><p></p><p>A shadow passed over Shuofeng's face.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianxuan Treasure Mirror..."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, maybe I was the first in the entire Wanxian Alliance to wear it." </p><p></p><p>"Let's not talk about it! Just the thought of it makes me annoyed!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li, let's have another battle!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, sharp sword lights flew out from Shuofeng and fiercely struck at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>There was even a hint of grievances within them.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart skipped a beat, not daring to be negligent, and immediately focused on responding.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>In Changsheng Valley.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji, who had been sent to recruit disciples from the outside, had now successfully completed his mission.</p><p></p><p>In the square of the sect's main hall, a group of five or six-year-old children stood.</p><p></p><p>They looked around timidly, their faces filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>Many of them even burst into tears on the spot, triggering a chain reaction.</p><p></p><p>Chaos ensued.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Fang, are these the 'good seedlings' you brought back?"</p>

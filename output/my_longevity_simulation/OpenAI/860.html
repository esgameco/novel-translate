        <h1>Chapter 860</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"This... this..." Zhong Shentong was dumbfounded, pointing at Ji Shaoli, unable to complete a sentence for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it's a pity it's not a purple-gold or dark-golden light group. But I can still accept it reluctantly," Ji Shaoli said calmly, reaching into it to feel around in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>The golden light gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>In its place, there was a round bead emitting a colorful halo.</p><p></p><p>At the moment of witnessing this colorful bead, Zhong Shentong's heart was filled with an inexplicable mix of emotions.</p><p></p><p>There was greed, a sense of loss, and regret.</p><p></p><p>It made him restless.</p><p></p><p>"Colorful Jade Void Luminous Light..." the moment he touched the bead, information about this object naturally appeared in Ji Shaoli's mind.</p><p></p><p>It came from a cultivation realm called "Chongyan."</p><p></p><p>In this realm, there was no sun or moon in the sky, only seven colorful lights that alternated and shone on the world.</p><p></p><p>Later, a great cultivator gathered and refined these seven lights.</p><p></p><p>Although it led to the creation of supreme treasures, it also directly caused the destruction of the Chongyan realm.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, this cultivator had already fallen. The treasure he crafted ended up in the Fishing Pond.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli was greatly shaken. Not only because the specifications of this colorful divine light were extremely high, surpassing ordinary Dao-merging objects.</p><p></p><p>But also because, if this level of treasure was only a gold-tier in the Fishing Pond, how terrifying would the purple-golden and dark-golden light groups be?</p><p></p><p>And what level of treasure was the Fishing Pond that could encompass all of them?</p><p></p><p>"It's definitely not an ordinary immortal tool."</p><p></p><p>"But they are all ownerless..."</p><p></p><p>"What has happened in the immortal world exactly?"</p><p></p><p>Thousands of thoughts surged in his mind, and Ji Shaoli did not directly refine the colorful divine light.</p><p></p><p>He just put it away and planned to deal with it later.</p><p></p><p>Regaining his senses, he looked at Zhong Shentong, who was still in shock, and asked in confusion, "What? Is it difficult to fish up this golden light group? Zhong Daoxiong has occupied this Fishing platform for decades. With your abilities, you should have caught quite a lot by now. Why are you so surprised?"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong opened his mouth, wanting to say something but stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Heh... heh..."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong's eyes were full of confusion, and he could only respond with a dry laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Well, luck is conserved. What you fished up this time is good. If you don't control your greed, it will probably be a waste of effort for a long time to come."</p><p></p><p>"I'll leave the matters here to you, Zhong Daoxiong. The affairs of the Union Federation are busy, and I can't stay here all the time," Ji Shaoli said with some regret.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, there may be geniuses from within the Union that will come here to try fishing from time to time in the future. I will notify you before they come," throwing a communication charm to Zhong Shentong, Ji Shaoli glanced regretfully at the Fishing Pond and finally called out to Lin Ling, leaving the small temple in the mountains.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong looked at the familiar scene in the temple that was now equipped with additional protective formations.</p><p></p><p>The experiences of this period felt like a dream, leaving him a bit bewildered.</p><p></p><p>However, it was the stone statue without a face that suddenly appeared in front of him that woke Zhong Shentong up.</p><p></p><p>After much contemplation, he sighed slightly, reluctantly accepting this reality. Then he looked back at the Fishing Pond and stubbornly sat back down.</p><p></p><p>Even though today's fishing quota had been used up, he still wanted to try.</p><p></p><p>Even if Ji Shaoli surpassed him in cultivation, realm, divine abilities, etc., Zhong Shentong would not feel upset.</p><p></p><p>But the fact that in such a short time, Ji Shaoli had fished up a golden light ball that Zhong Shentong had only fished twice in his life made him completely unable to accept it.</p><p></p><p>"I am no less skilled in fishing than others!"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong made up his mind, continuously practicing the swinging of his fishing rod in his mind.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Above the mountain temple.</p><p></p><p>In the shadows, Ji Shaoli carefully monitored Zhong Shentong's life for two to three days.</p><p></p><p>He found that apart from being increasingly immersed in fishing, there were no other abnormal behaviors from him, so he left with peace of mind.</p><p></p><p>"Relying solely on the title of the compassionate True Immortal in the mortal world is not a long-term plan."</p><p></p><p>"With the foundation-building cultivation, there is no need for a real Essence Inducing fruit. After I make a breakthrough, I can use the 'Bloodline Crossing' secret method."</p><p></p><p>Obviously, the endless treasures in the Fishing Pond could not be fully explored in a short period. Therefore, Ji Shaoli did not stay here all the time with the plan to fish every day.</p><p></p><p>Even if he fished for a hundred years alone, compared to the vast starry sky, it would be just a drop in the bucket. Moreover, relying on luck alone to fish without knowing the specifics of the treasures was inefficient.</p><p></p><p>"Yes. In the future, outstanding contributors in the Multiverse Union Federation can come here to fish once."</p><p></p><p>"Even if they really fish out some supreme treasures, I am not afraid. In the end, everything will belong to me."</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation, Ji Shaoli went to the Spiritual Wood Realm with Lin Ling and handed over the "Colorful Jade Void Luminous Light" to his true self.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he return to the Haixuan Island.</p><p></p><p>As usual, he checked through the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>During his focused fishing time, the situation was not peaceful within the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The hundreds of candidates for the "Thirty-three Immortal Selection" had mostly returned.</p><p></p><p>Only thirty-three cultivators remained at the Immortal Alliance headquarters, indicating that the chosen immortals had been finally determined!</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew that these chosen immortals were guaranteed to have a brilliant future with their established Dao-merging cultivation base.</p><p></p><p>Their backgrounds had already been thoroughly investigated.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was to seek favor with them or build good relationships in advance, as long as they were not foolish cultivators, everyone began to try every means to connect with these thirty-three chosen immortals.</p><p></p><p>Although Wang Qi, who successfully entered the selection, seemed to be a solitary figure, there were still many cultivators who came from afar to contact his friends.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the organization Wang Qi had previously participated in, the CloudSea Mutual Aid Association, also came into the public eye.</p><p></p><p>However, after investigation, it was found that the members of this mutual aid association were all cultivators within the Immortal Alliance system and had no deep roots. The highest cultivation base among them was just at the Yuanying stage.</p><p></p><p>"It's just seeking warmth by huddling together."</p><p></p><p>This was the conclusion reached.</p><p></p><p>Having realized the good fortune of this small group, Zhong Shentong could not help but feel amazed. Although they were few in number, they had produced a chosen immortal.</p><p></p><p>Initially, the members of the mutual aid association were nervous when facing the inquiries that came one after another. But when they realized that the so-called 'major factions' were not paying attention to them and only spoke a few words before redirecting the focus to Wang Qi, they gradually let go of their worries.</p><p></p><p>However, they didn't really have much to disclose.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Together with it, the rapid expansion of the cave's land was happening once again.</p><p></p><p>With abundant river water nourishing it, the vegetation inside the cave became even more lush. Trees sprung up densely, flourishing.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Yu will give birth to the river..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the Sacred Embryo Xu Bai with some satisfaction nodding.</p><p></p><p>Then leaving the cave and once again embarking on a journey in the mysterious yellow realm.</p><p></p><p>Like an ordinary person, measuring this land with his own two feet.</p><p></p><p>Whenever encountering a suitable transformation of Tian Yu, it was like harvesting herbs and incorporating it into his own cave.</p><p></p><p>After the initial shock, as he saw more, he became somewhat numb and accustomed to it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had read many insights from Core Formation cultivators turning into deities.</p><p></p><p>It was said that the transformation of Tian Yu in the world, like the meridians in a mortal's body, was extremely difficult to find without special means.</p><p></p><p>And once it was extracted, it would cause a huge sensation, creating a great disturbance.</p><p></p><p>But all these experiences were ineffective on Sacred Embryo Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>By just squinting and observing for a moment, one could determine the presence or absence of the "transformation of the heavens and the earth".</p><p></p><p>Then, with a slow wave of his hand, as if summoning a light breeze from the heavens and earth. Quietly and imperceptibly, he would make it his own.</p><p></p><p>As more and more changes and innovations were integrated into the cave, driven by the power of transformation, Sacred Embryo Xu Bai's own cave was renewed daily.</p><p></p><p>Mountains, rivers, valleys, plains, rivers, forests...</p><p></p><p>The cave world was full of vitality, constantly changing, resembling a small world that was continuously growing.</p><p></p><p>However, Sacred Embryo Xu Bai wrinkled his brow in a rare show of concern.</p><p></p><p>"Something seems to be missing."</p><p></p><p>"This vitality is just a fa√ßade and cannot support a perfect cycle on its own."</p><p></p><p>"If there is no external injection, this artificially thriving cave will soon return to desolation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sensed the thoughts of the other party.</p><p></p><p>Sacred Embryo Xu Bai, on the other hand, flew in mid-air, scanning the surroundings and then looking into the distance.</p><p></p><p>This went on for a whole day.</p><p></p><p>Then, a slight smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>Calm and composed, he took a step forward towards his destination.</p><p></p><p>From Li Fan's perspective, Sacred Embryo Xu Bai's speed was not fast at all.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even use his spiritual power, just relying solely on his physical body to move forward.</p><p></p><p>But to an outsider, it seemed as though he was covering vast distances in a single step, disappearing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"It's not me moving, but rather the heavens and earth cooperating actively to shorten the distance."</p><p></p><p>"Condensing space to move swiftly."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan carefully pondered his steps, the changes in the surrounding heavens and earth brought a sudden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"Although this time, Mr. Bai used my body for rebirth, it's also a great opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"Every untapped transformation of Tian Yu represents the supreme wealth that can create powerful deities."</p><p></p><p>"And, every move of Sacred Embryo Xu Bai is in harmony with the heavens and earth. Each can be seen as divine abilities."</p><p></p><p>"Such as the greenery that nurtures the cave, or plucking the essence of the heavens effortlessly. And even this space-shrinking technique now."</p><p></p><p>"With my level of comprehension, realizing one insight each lifetime is already fortunate. But they are coming one after another now."</p><p></p><p>"Even more valuable is that all these abilities are being exerted through my body, senses, just like I would do it myself, seamlessly. With a little more contemplation in the future, it might be possible to perfectly recreate them."</p><p></p><p>"The prerequisite being, if there is a next life."</p><p></p><p>Countless thoughts raced through Li Fan's mind as Sacred Embryo Xu Bai finally arrived at his destination after a long journey.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... the Cloudy Mist Sea?"</p><p></p><p>A surprised expression flashed in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>It had been almost ten years since the world-destroying event at Mo Sha.</p><p></p><p>Although it still looked like the post-apocalyptic scenery here, the previously raging lava had ceased spewing. It had gradually cooled down, forming hard black rocks.</p><p></p><p>The spaces and voids that seemed to have been gnawed by insects had all healed unknowingly.</p><p></p><p>At a glance, the ruins of the Cloudy Mist Sea appeared desolate.</p><p></p><p>But with a closer inspection, there seemed to be a different kind of power incubating.</p><p></p><p>If other cultivators were to come here, they would probably sense a deadly crisis and be wary of it.</p><p></p><p>Sacred Embryo Xu Bai gazed at the ruins for a long time before entering the Cloudy Mist Sea. However, before stepping in, he glanced in the direction of Yuandao Province.</p><p></p><p>An intense feeling of resentment and fear surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>For the first time, a negative emotion was revealed on Sacred Embryo Xu Bai's face.</p><p></p><p>With a cold snort, he turned around, stepping calmly into the Cloudy Mist Sea.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the emotions that arose when glimpsing Yuandao Province, as he walked through the ruins here, Sacred Embryo Xu Bai's emotions were unexpectedly complex.</p><p></p><p>It was a blend of multiple emotions that made it difficult for Li Fan to discern the exact nature of the feeling.</p><p></p><p>However, his attention quickly shifted to the movements of Sacred Embryo Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, his purpose for this journey was to perfect the "transformation of Tian Yu" in his own cave.</p><p></p><p>He didn't reach out like before but showed unusual solemnity this time.</p><p></p><p>Using his hand as a pen, he drew lines of reality and illusion in the sky as he moved between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The continuous lines stretched from the west where Yuandao Province and Shi Linzhou were near the coast, to the east where the endless ocean met.</p><p></p><p>After nearly half a day's effort, the approximate area of the original Cloudy Mist Sea was enclosed within those lines.</p><p></p><p>However, the contours were peculiar and it was much smaller than the original Cloudy Mist Sea area.</p><p></p><p>Upon closing the lines of reality and illusion, they suddenly disappeared into the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Then, Sacred Embryo Xu Bai took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Reaching out to grasp the invisible circle, he slowly exerted force.</p><p></p><p>As the circle was gradually collected in his hand, something seemed to be pulled out from the heavens and earth in this Cloudy Mist Sea area.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan concentrated intensely, not wanting to miss any detail.</p><p></p><p>The crystal in his mind emitted a radiant blue light, recording every insight and comprehension originating from Sacred Embryo Xu Bai, without missing any detail.</p><p></p><p>Initially, the process of gathering the lines seemed relatively easy for Sacred Embryo Xu Bai. But as he progressed, the counterforce from the void seemed to grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>Each tightening required almost his entire strength. The fine lines gathered in his palm became tangible upon contact, feeling warm like a gentle spring breeze yet cold like ice threads.</p><p></p><p>With a resolute eye, Sacred Embryo Xu Bai continued to collect the lines.</p><p></p><p>As more and more of the circle was pulled out, a sudden change occurred in the once calm Cloudy Mist Sea ruins!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The previously quelled black and red molten lava erupted violently once again.</p><p></p><p>Numerous black-colored wriggling voids emerged like countless small insects, densely covering the area.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying aura of the end times descended suddenly.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." Li Fan's pupils shrunk in shock.</p><p></p><p>"The Cloudy Mist Sea that was about to recover has turned into a dead land again!"</p><p></p><p>"Those pulled out are the forces that drive the world's revival!"</p><p></p><p>The surroundings turned back into a veritable earthly purgatory, yet Sacred Embryo Xu Bai's actions continued without the slightest hesitation.</p>

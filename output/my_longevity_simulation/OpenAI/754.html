        <h1>Chapter 754</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Hmm?" Li Fan was slightly stunned. New chapter 69 book→69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Liu San was about to reply but was preempted by Fang Zaiji: "Hehe, Master, are you in seclusion or just absent-minded? There are no disciples in our Medicine King Sect at the Foundation Building stage anymore. Even those with the worst aptitude have already successfully built their foundations."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's movement of stroking the dissociation disk paused slightly.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I'll have to trouble Mr. Fang to go out and select some good seedlings." Li Fan pretended to suddenly realize, then said somewhat helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"It's best to carry the End Disc with you and be cautious. Otherwise, if discovered by the Wanxian Alliance cultivators, there might be no escape from a battle." He kindly reminded.</p><p></p><p>"Uh." Fang Zaiji's face immediately fell, "Master..."</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Fang, you better go and come back quickly. After all, it's about breaking the Sky Mirror Seal. I am a bit worried about entrusting it to others." Li Fan pleaded.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that he could not escape, Fang Zaiji could only glare at Liu San, who was watching the scene, and then flew away directly.</p><p></p><p>"I also want to go out and have a look." At this moment, Jiang Yushan, who had been silent all along, spoke suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Liu San was immediately astonished.</p><p></p><p>"I've been here for too long, feeling a bit stifled." Jiang Yushan said faintly, "It seems quite lively outside now, with countless small worlds hidden for thousands of years finally revealing themselves. I am very interested. Perhaps I might even meet some old acquaintances." New chapter 69 book 28shuxu.com</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment and agreed.</p><p></p><p>Handing over an End Disc and a communication talisman to each other, Li Fan instructed, "Safety comes first. If our Medicine King Sect wants to rise again, we cannot do it without the help of Elder Jiang."</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured." Jiang Yushan responded coldly, then left in a flash.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, I..." Liu San hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"Liu Lao, you stay in the Medicine King Valley. There's an important matter coming up soon, and I'll need you to accompany me on a trip." Li Fan waved his hand decisively, rejecting Liu San's request.</p><p></p><p>Liu San looked crestfallen, unable to go against Li Fan's decision, so he went to vent his frustration on the disciples of the Medicine King Sect in the valley.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to focus on nurturing the dissociation disk.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the cloned Xu Bai, who had returned to Tianliang City, learned about the recent progress of the Xianmeng's conquest of the myriad realms.</p><p></p><p>It had been smooth sailing all along, but shortly after he returned to the Xuanhuang Realm, the fervent cultivators finally suffered their first defeat.</p><p></p><p>The initial team that entered the small world consisted of hundreds of cultivators, led by three Nascent Soul masters and fifty Core Formation experts.</p><p></p><p>Such a formidable force almost suffered a complete annihilation.</p><p></p><p>The only survivor was a Foundation Establishment cultivator named Lu Zhixian.</p><p></p><p>He was at the end of the team, initially joining the expedition only because of his relationship with the Nascent Soul leaders. New chapter 69 book 28shuxu.com</p><p></p><p>Thinking of gaining some merit, he never expected the situation to take a turn for the worse. Sensing danger, Lu Zhixian decisively fled.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because of his low strength, the enemies did not completely exterminate him.</p><p></p><p>Such a major defeat naturally caused a huge stir and led to an official investigation by the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>With the images recorded by the Sky Mirror, suspicion that Lu Zhixian was a spy was quickly dispelled. He was declared innocent and released.</p><p></p><p>As the images were made public, they stirred up quite a controversy.</p><p></p><p>The final annihilation of the expedition team was attributed to a single person.</p><p></p><p>With white hair and eyebrows, full of wrinkles, he appeared extremely aged, as if he could pass away at any moment.</p><p></p><p>However, his actions were decisive and ruthless.</p><p></p><p>His hair and beard seemed alive, striking out aggressively. Like silver-colored dragons, they pierced through the bodies of the Xianmeng cultivators in an instant.</p><p></p><p>What's even more shocking was that after his hair and beard pierced the bodies of the Xianmeng cultivators, they seemed to absorb their life force.</p><p></p><p>Numerous cultivators instantly aged, some of them even unable to cry out and turned into skeletons.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the old man's face gained a flush.</p><p></p><p>The strength of this white-haired old man was at least at the Harmonization Realm. It seemed he had a special advantage in the small world, as ordinary Nascent Soul cultivators had no resistance in front of him. They could only watch helplessly as their lives were drained.</p><p></p><p>This footage immediately stirred up great anger among the Wanxian Alliance cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"He can actually absorb the life essence of cultivators? Such behavior is no different from demonic! He must be eliminated!"</p><p></p><p>"Well said, I support you, fellow cultivator! Go quickly and behead him!"</p><p></p><p>"Hiss, I never thought that such a ruthless person existed in the small worlds. I think without a couple of Nascent Souls stepping forward, it's impossible to kill him."</p><p></p><p>"You fools, can't you see? Lu Zhixian intentionally let him go, to leak information. It's to attract more cultivators to go and die!"</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense. But if that's the case, why doesn't he just leave that small world and wreak havoc in the Xuanhuang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Because he's not as foolish as you."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Although it sparked a huge discussion, the cultivators of the Xianmeng were not foolish. As there was such a monster in that small world, they decided to avoid it. There were countless unexplored small worlds, so why bother fighting it? It was better to pick the soft persimmons!</p><p></p><p>A dramatic scene unfolded.</p><p></p><p>The small world was marked on the map with red skull symbols by the cultivators, yet no one dared to explore it further.</p><p></p><p>"In the end, the Wanxian Alliance will surely send people to clean it up."</p><p></p><p>The Wanxian Alliance seemed to tacitly accept this behavior and did not issue any wanted notices for this small world.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting." Xu Bai investigated and learned that there seemed to be disputes within the Xianmeng regarding how to handle this small world.</p><p></p><p>One faction believed that such small fry should be quickly eradicated to demonstrate the supreme authority of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The other faction believed that in future conquests, they would definitely encounter opponents of similar strength to this white-haired old man. If they always had to eliminate every threat, casualties were inevitable.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators at the Harmonization level were the backbone of the Xianmeng. Losing one was a huge loss.</p><p></p><p>Even though there was the Well of Reincarnation where one could revive after death, the idea of "reviving" as a Harmonization cultivator seemed to be dreaded. There were not many willing to be the first to sacrifice.</p><p></p><p>After some inquiries, Xu Bai finally understood the reasons behind it.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that despite various methods that could enable revival and even retaining memories and cultivation level from before.</p><p></p><p>There was a fatal flaw that prevented all Harmonization cultivators from ignoring it—once you entered the Well of Reincarnation, you would never have the opportunity to advance to the Longevity Realm.</p><p></p><p>The reason for this was unknown, but judging from the performance of various Harmonization cultivators, it seemed it was true.</p><p></p><p>After all, which powerful Harmonization cultivator did not have the ambition to achieve Longevity?</p><p></p><p>Reviving was only a last resort in the end.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 998</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Originally, Li Fan thought that using the Real Fruit of Temptation would go as smoothly as before. However, he was somewhat surprised when the silver-white color was about to invade the minds of the two, but suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they had encountered some sort of obstacle, as the power of the Real Fruit of Temptation was completely blocked from their souls.</p><p></p><p>The Real Fruit of Temptation disappeared in the air, but it did not change the perception of Xuansu Chang and Lu Xichan.</p><p></p><p>Instead, the silver light tightly enveloped their souls.</p><p></p><p>"What is this..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression changed, and upon careful observation, he found that it was not the failure of the power of the True Celestial.</p><p></p><p>Their souls had a special defense layer that resisted the influence of distorted perception.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the high-level souls of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance have a special defense mechanism."</p><p></p><p>"It makes sense; otherwise, with just mass-producing Real Fruits of Temptation, the Five Elders could have conquered the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance."</p><p></p><p>After the initial unsuccessful induction attempt, Li Fan did not give up.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he did not plan to inquire with Mo Rubin about the soul defense mechanism.</p><p></p><p>"Xuansu Chang is involved in the secrets of the Tianxuan Mirror's avatar, it seems I will have to use you for experimentation." Li Fan's gaze turned to the sleeping Lu Xichan.</p><p></p><p>In addition to Mo Rubin's shadow seal, Li Fan also consecutively laid formations around the two.</p><p></p><p>Ensuring that in case of any mishap during the experiment, they would not wake up inexplicably and be unable to communicate with the outside world or escape. </p><p></p><p>He then sent a strand of divine sense into Lu Xichan's soul.</p><p></p><p>It had to be said that Lu Xichan's soul strength was somewhat inadequate compared to her position as the chief of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance Strategy Hall.</p><p></p><p>In the Yunsui Tiangong, Li Fan had once treated Hanhai, coming into close contact with his soul.</p><p></p><p>As fellow Daoists, Lu Xichan was significantly weaker than the former head of Yunsui Tiangong.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not feel threatened at all and observed calmly.</p><p></p><p>Outside the soul, there seemed to be dark golden lines engraved with patterns.</p><p></p><p>Appearing and disappearing from time to time, they seemed like chains, not only binding the soul but also forming a protective layer similar to armor.</p><p></p><p>But during his observation, Li Fan keenly discovered that apart from protection, these dark golden patterns probably had a self-destruct function.</p><p></p><p>"If forcefully breaking through the protection of the dark golden patterns, these chains, which have almost merged with the soul, would instantly shatter into pieces..."</p><p></p><p>"The only outcome would be soul scattering!"</p><p></p><p>Understanding the role of the dark golden patterns, Li Fan immediately felt the situation was challenging.</p><p></p><p>But fortunately, after a brief moment of contemplation, Li Fan found a similar case in the Getian Records.</p><p></p><p>It spoke of two cultivators who sought medical advice from the heavens with their son.</p><p></p><p>These two cultivators had been Dao companions since the Qi Refining period. Supporting each other along the way, they progressed together, finally reaching the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p></p><p>They were blessed with a son, which was considered a double blessing.</p><p></p><p>However, what caught these two cultivators off guard was that even when their son was over ten years old, he still could not speak.</p><p></p><p>With a dull and ignorant appearance, he showed very weak responses to the outside world. Only when his parents called him, he would respond accordingly.</p><p></p><p>After examining him, the heavenly physician explained the cause to them.</p><p></p><p>Their son's soul was not damaged or incomplete; it was even stronger than ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But the vast soul and the weak body were not compatible, leading to the overflowing of soul power that formed a cage-like cocoon of distortion.</p><p></p><p>After a long period of abnormality, it eventually tightly wrapped up his original soul, making it difficult to communicate with the outside world.</p><p></p><p>To solve this, it was actually straightforward.</p><p></p><p>All that was needed was to trim these young branches of the soul.</p><p></p><p>But to truly resolve the issue was not as easy as it sounded.</p><p></p><p>These branches were also part of the original soul.</p><p></p><p>To clean them without harming the original soul and without provoking intense resistance from the entire soul...</p><p></p><p>The heavenly physician provided the best solution.</p><p></p><p>The immediate family's souls would touch and cleanse these soul branches.</p><p></p><p>Using their own souls as scissors, they would clean them all.</p><p></p><p>During the process, the souls of both the savior and the practitioner would merge.</p><p></p><p>But precisely because they were close family members, there would be no conflict from start to finish.</p><p></p><p>It was somewhat akin to living together for an extended period.</p><p></p><p>The only cost was that the practitioner's soul would suffer severe damage.</p><p></p><p>A drop in several realms was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly physician explained the solution to the two, and the expressions of the couple clearly differed.</p><p></p><p>After a heated argument, the couple ultimately chose not to treat their child.</p><p></p><p>To spare him from further suffering, the couple themselves killed their child.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, this pair of divine companions also gradually grew apart.</p><p></p><p>Later, during pursuit by enemies, they each fled for their lives, only to ultimately perish.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"This kind of spiritual restriction seems very similar to the soul branches in that case."</p><p></p><p>"Intertwined with the soul, extremely sensitive to external forces, and if the body is damaged, it will take the original soul down with it."</p><p></p><p>"However, because it is intertwined with the soul, it does not have that much defense against the soul power itself."</p><p></p><p>"So, to remove the soul restriction, the method is indeed similar."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had already made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a continuous stream of soul power quietly poured into Lu Xichan's soul.</p><p></p><p>Facing the grand and dam-like dark golden protection, like a surging tide, it forcefully collided.</p><p></p><p>As the restriction itself had to deal with the fluctuations of soul power, a similar soul impact was commonplace and did not trigger a counterattack.</p><p></p><p>However, during the continuous cleansing process, the soul power output by Li Fan was quickly depleted.</p><p></p><p>But soon enough, Li Fan, operating the Infinite Yin-Yang Technique, redirected the soul power again.</p><p></p><p>Like rocks on the shore eroded by the sea over years, the dark golden pattern restriction similarly faded away gradually.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes, outputting soul power, and before long, a dark golden pattern slowly faded and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The original Real Fruit of Temptation that had been circling outside Lu Xichan's soul, mixed with Li Fan's soul power, used this opening to pour in mightily.</p><p></p><p>Colliding with Lu Xichan's soul!</p><p></p><p>If it was only Li Fan's soul alone, a stranger's intrusion would undoubtedly alert and trigger Lu Xichan's defenses, even if she was in a state of sleep.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, within the Real Fruit of Temptation, there contained carefully crafted lies by Li Fan.</p>

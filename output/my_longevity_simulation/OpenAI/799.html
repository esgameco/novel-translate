        <h1>Chapter 799</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Many scenes of Modan Lake emerged, accompanied by a radiant light.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Xinghan was drawn to the scenes in this light, the jade disc seemed to be like a living being, emitting waves of eager feelings.</p><p></p><p>As Gu Xinghan came to his senses, he was somewhat puzzled and surprised.</p><p></p><p>However, he had heard of treasures possessing spirits before.</p><p></p><p>After quickly accepting this concept, Gu Xinghan started to feel the jade disc's desire.</p><p></p><p>But it was just an instinctual reaction to Modan Lake.</p><p></p><p>The jade disc could not speak, relying entirely on him to guess…</p><p></p><p>Gu Xinghan tried various methods to try to satisfy the jade disc.</p><p></p><p>Spirit stones, mineral jades, herbs…</p><p></p><p>The jade disc seemed to show no interest in any of these.</p><p></p><p>It continued to emit a persistent desire towards Gu Xinghan.</p><p></p><p>And with other little companions successfully building their foundations, he was at a loss on how to explain.</p><p></p><p>The combination of these two reasons made Gu Xinghan feel restless.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until a fortuitous coincidence, seeing Elder Fang Zaiji preparing the "Endtimes Disc" for his newly recruited core disciples, that Gu Xinghan suddenly understood its goal.</p><p></p><p>"This…"</p><p></p><p>Gu Xinghan hesitated.</p><p></p><p>After all, the "Endtimes Disc" was something Elder Fang repeatedly emphasized as a precious item to pay attention to.</p><p></p><p>If there was a mistake…</p><p></p><p>But in the end, he couldn't resist the jade disc.</p><p></p><p>A flash of light passed, and the jade disc appeared in his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Under Gu Xinghan's cautious observation, the jade disc slowly descended onto the "Endtimes Disc."</p><p></p><p>Then from underneath, it extended dense and tiny light beams, resembling tentacles.</p><p></p><p>Adhering to the "Endtimes Disc."</p><p></p><p>Initially, Gu Xinghan thought the jade disc would damage the "Endtimes Disc.</p><p></p><p>But after observing for a while, he realized that was not the case.</p><p></p><p>Instead, the two seemed to be merging into one through the sticky light beams.</p><p></p><p>This put Gu Xinghan's mind at ease.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he felt a sense of novelty.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that these two jade discs and the disc are actually the same thing?" Gu Xinghan couldn't help but think.</p><p></p><p>However, because of his childish nature, Gu Xinghan quickly stopped researching after finding no results and instead focused on studying the scenes he obtained from the jade disc.</p><p></p><p>"Building my foundation? What is this? It seems to match my internal situation?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Xinghan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>He no longer paid attention to the jade disc and devoted himself to studying the method of building his foundation.</p><p></p><p>When he regained consciousness from the meditation, the jade disc had been completely integrated with the "Endtimes Disc."</p><p></p><p>However, this integration process seemed as if the jade disc was pressed onto him, almost forced.</p><p></p><p>And the final product wasn't as aesthetically pleasing.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Xinghan didn't care about this.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the jade disc might indeed be a remarkable treasure.</p><p></p><p>Although young, Gu Xinghan was not naive. On the contrary, he was very aware of the dangers of the world.</p><p></p><p>Knowing the principle that a man without fault carries the burden of everyone's faults, he decided to keep silent, whether it was regarding the jade disc or the method of building his foundation.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I can use this new jade disc as a cover-up. Claim it to be my miraculous foundation-building item…" the young Gu Xinghan pondered in this way.</p><p></p><p>Thus, in secrecy, the only cultivator of the "Building Foundation with Me" technique in the world began his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>At the beginning, his performance surprised the members of the Medicine King Sect, including Liusan.</p><p></p><p>He quickly grasped the essentials, and breakthroughs came effortlessly.</p><p></p><p>Among his peers, he became unbeatable, and even refining Golden Core Dan was a piece of cake.</p><p></p><p>For a while, Gu Xinghan became the most outstanding junior disciple of the Medicine King Sect.</p><p></p><p>But…</p><p></p><p>His peak period, like a shooting star, passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, his peers made breakthroughs to the Golden Core and Original Infant realms.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Gu Xinghan remained stagnant in his progress.</p><p></p><p>This highly unusual situation puzzled Liusan and others in the Medicine King Sect.</p><p></p><p>Thinking there might be something wrong with Gu Xinghan's body, they took turns examining him but failed to discover any problems.</p><p></p><p>When asked, Gu Xinghan simply stated that he had done his best but couldn't advance further.</p><p></p><p>Thirty years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The Medicine King Sect had no choice but to accept this fact.</p><p></p><p>They officially gave up on nurturing Gu Xinghan.</p><p></p><p>However, they did not overly criticize him, and he still had access to various resources but was no longer the center of attention.</p><p></p><p>Facing peers whose cultivation surpassed his own, Gu Xinghan became increasingly silent.</p><p></p><p>He lived in seclusion, avoiding worldly affairs and rarely interacting with others.</p><p></p><p>He was almost forgotten by everyone.</p><p></p><p>And so, 263 years passed.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired Gu Xinghan finally reached the end of his life.</p><p></p><p>"Golden Core Dan, Golden Core Dan…"</p><p></p><p>"What does it mean to reach Unity?"</p><p></p><p>He laughed bitterly, his face filled with sorrow.</p><p></p><p>"To create something out of nothing, to carve a new path. It's too hard, incredibly hard…"</p><p></p><p>"To succeed in 'Building Foundation with Me' without even the chance to regret or change the cultivation method."</p><p></p><p>In his hands suddenly appeared a smooth jade disc.</p><p></p><p>It was as inconspicuous as a stone found by the roadside, not attracting anyone's attention.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xinghan gazed at the jade disc that had accompanied him for almost a lifetime with a complicated expression.</p><p></p><p>"Mistake me for a lifetime, mistake me for a lifetime…"</p><p></p><p>He murmured softly.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to throw the jade disc on the ground fiercely, but he felt a reluctance.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he firmly held onto the jade disc. Amidst a sense of reluctance, he passed away.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xinghan's death did not cause any ripples.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until three years later, due to the lack of any signs after his death, that people discovered his body.</p><p></p><p>Over two centuries had passed, and Longevity Valley had already changed beyond recognition.</p><p></p><p>Hardly anyone remembered the once hopeful figure in the Medicine King Sect.</p><p></p><p>No one paid attention.</p><p></p><p>The funeral was simple.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Gu Xinghan's body was buried in the disciples' cemetery of the Medicine King Sect within the Beast Clan Realm.</p><p></p><p>His few remaining possessions, including the jade disc in Gu Xinghan's hands, went unnoticed.</p><p></p><p>Buried alongside him, disappearing into the endless darkness underground.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Beyond the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Medicine King True Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>A figure extremely similar to Li Fan but extremely weak, groaned softly.</p><p></p><p>He wiped the fresh blood constantly flowing from his mouth and nose, as if he might die from excessive blood loss at any moment.</p><p></p><p>But his expression remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>"In the cauldron for a moment, a thousand years pass in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>He coughed softly, eyes filled with infinite emotions.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Medicine King True Cauldron was the "Sacred Embryo Li Fan."</p><p></p><p>As part of a disguise, Li Fan used his own blood to create a secondary incarnation through the "Sacred Blood as Embryo Technique" before the arrival of Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>Due to the rushed timeline and having the same aptitude as the original, he was just a complete ordinary mortal without any cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Not long after leaving the Xuanhuang Realm, he felt that the Medicine King Cauldron had deviated from its original trajectory.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the scenes transmitted from his body avatar, the "Disassociation Disc," were increasing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>The massive amount of information almost overwhelmed his brain but eventually subsided, easing the pressure.</p><p></p><p>"Although I'm an incarnation, because my Sacred Embryo still exists, I can remotely control the body avatar with some simple manipulation."</p><p></p><p>"It's limited to this, though."</p><p></p><p>The information recorded in the Disassociation Disc happened within the Xuanhuang Realm, but being outside, Li Fan did not witness the battle between the transmission master and Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>However, being able to witness the Transmission Master's actions for the first time was a significant gain for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Temporarily setting aside thoughts about the Transmission, the Sacred Embryo Li Fan was now becoming somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>He was about to see the legendary "Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>Creaking sounds echoed from various parts of the Medicine King True Cauldron, indicating the immense pressure it was enduring.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan used the already-prepared Far-Seeing Mirror in the cauldron to look towards the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>Ahead, darkness enveloped everything.</p><p></p><p>The Medicine King Cauldron's speed continued to increase.</p><p></p><p>Thunderous roars reverberated from all directions.</p><p></p><p>As if there were imminent risks of disintegration.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, in Li Fan's view, he still didn't see anything.</p><p></p><p>"Is it going to end like this?"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Medicine King Cauldron started to disintegrate.</p><p></p><p>The violent shaking made it nearly impossible for him to stand stably.</p><p></p><p>Struggling, Li Fan carried the Far-Seeing Mirror and hid in the most central part of the Medicine King True Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>It was a narrow refuge made entirely of Eternal-Jade Essence Gold.</p><p></p><p>Under the increasingly strong, almost unimaginable enormous pressure, the Medicine King Cauldron finally couldn't hold on and shattered into countless pieces.</p><p></p><p>And they all plummeted towards the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>Just moments later, Li Fan felt that even the Eternal-Jade Essence Gold couldn't withstand the pressure.</p><p></p><p>But due to his innate temperament, he did not give up.</p><p></p><p>Raising the Far-Seeing Mirror once more, he looked ahead.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he was slightly startled.</p><p></p><p>In the originally pitch-black vision, he found that there was a continuous wasteland.</p><p></p><p>The wasteland was littered with numerous ruins.</p><p></p><p>A tall corpse sat cross-legged on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Most of the flesh and blood had almost vanished, leaving only a layer of skin hanging on the bones.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of blood-red chains were deeply embedded in the ground.</p><p></p><p>Binding this skeleton on the wasteland.</p><p></p><p>And around the corpse were deep trenches crisscrossing each other.</p><p></p><p>On the vast wasteland, they outlined an extremely intricate symbol.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't recognize the symbol, upon seeing it, Li Fan naturally understood its meaning.</p><p></p><p>It was a word.</p><p></p><p>A word, "Hunger"!</p><p></p><p>A sense of endless hunger surged into Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>At the same time...</p>

        <h1>Chapter 903</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fanyuan is now in the infant stage, while his second self, Li Qing, has only achieved perfection in the Golden Core stage. </p><p></p><p>However, their realm is just an empty shell, lacking the miraculous objects and the golden cores of laws inside their bodies.</p><p></p><p>But for Li Fan, this is not a difficult matter. </p><p></p><p>"Just right to try it out, to see how much difference there is between the bloodline incarnation of the mini-world's Heavenly Dao and Mr. Bai."</p><p></p><p>With the second self, he quietly returned to the Sword Peak within the Tianjian Sect. </p><p></p><p>He stood in front of the plain black sword. </p><p></p><p>Not sitting next to the miraculous body of the Wooden Sword Tianqi, without facing the pressure of the ten thousand swords in the sword mound.</p><p></p><p>Under the protection of his main body, the second self could barely survive in this sword mound. </p><p></p><p>However, whenever he had the intention to take the black sword away, there would be a faint sense of killing intent coming from the center of the sword mound.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan coldly snorted in his heart, completely ignoring the other party's dissatisfaction. </p><p></p><p>He shot several colorful divine lights to protect his second self, Li Qing. </p><p></p><p>Then Li Qing sat cross-legged near the black sword. </p><p></p><p>Using the sword intent condensed by his own mind to nurture it. </p><p></p><p>Yes, Li Fan was going to use his understanding of the sword path to mature this black sword! </p><p></p><p>Because most of Li Fan's understanding of the sword path comes from the Wooden Sword Tianqi. </p><p></p><p>So it did not encounter much resistance. </p><p></p><p>In this way, Li Qing slowly imprinted every trace of his own mark on the black sword. </p><p></p><p>And perhaps due to the innate talent derived from the Heavenly Dao incarnation, after some time, the killing intent from the Wooden Sword Tianqi slowly dissipated. </p><p></p><p>It seemed to have accepted this result. </p><p></p><p>After observing the sword mound for a while and confirming that nothing would go wrong, Li Fan quietly left. </p><p></p><p>Of course, before leaving, Li Fan also left enough means for his second self, Li Qing. </p><p></p><p>Ensuring that even in the event of an accident, he could forcibly pull out the black sword and safely retreat. </p><p></p><p>"With the simultaneous catalysis of the second self, the time needed for the black sword to transform into a miraculous object is greatly reduced. It is estimated that it will only take a year to emerge. Although the power may be slightly reduced compared to natural gestation, it doesn't matter to me." </p><p></p><p>As for the path of the second self in the future, without experiencing the foundation building of the Wooden Sword Tianqi, Li Fan did not take any precautions. </p><p></p><p>"It is said that the foundation building of the Wooden Sword Tianqi is different from other miraculous objects. It does not require seeking other caves, the methods of life, and the essence of heaven and earth. Only the Wooden Sword Tianqi can completely replace them." </p><p></p><p>"Let's see how it goes." </p><p></p><p>"If really is the case, in the new law cultivation system, this advantage is too great. Without the constraints of these necessary resources, the speed of the second self's cultivation may even be faster than mine who has the 'Sitting Immortal Technique' to sit and enjoy success." </p><p></p><p>"When the time comes..." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly paused. </p><p></p><p>In principle, the cultivation level of the second self could not surpass that of the main body. </p><p></p><p>But if...</p><p></p><p>Just if, is there a possibility that through some special method, this limitation could be lifted? </p><p></p><p>Leading to the cultivation level of the second self surpassing that of the main body? </p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan cannot achieve it now, the Xuanhuang Realm has a long history, with countless monsters and demons. </p><p></p><p>It would not be surprising if such a thing had happened before. </p><p></p><p>"Main body, second self..." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned slightly, the thought that had flashed in his mind before, but was put aside, suddenly reappeared. </p><p></p><p>While pondering silently, Li Fan did not return directly to the Spirit Wood Realm. </p><p></p><p>Instead, he came to the side of the fishing pool. </p><p></p><p>He had received a message from Lin Ling earlier, saying that the senior in front of the stone tablet who had been contemplating suddenly woke up some time ago. </p><p></p><p>For the first time, he left his fishing spot, silently walking alone in the backyard. </p><p></p><p>Recalling the changing form of the figure transmitted by Lin Ling, Li Fan was slightly shocked in his heart. </p><p></p><p>Because that figure was none other than Mr. Bai! </p><p></p><p>"It seems that the senior in front of the stone tablet must know what happened to Mr. Bai." </p><p></p><p>After contemplating for not long, the senior in front of the stone tablet returned to the appearance of a baby. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not approach, only bowed from a distance. </p><p></p><p>Then he whispered, "May I ask senior, how much do you know about the Xuantian Sect?" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew that for an existence like the senior before the stone tablet, even if he was contemplating, it did not hinder him from communicating with others. </p><p></p><p>"The mage's name is Morubin. He is quite kind, so you shouldn't worry about your safety." </p><p></p><p>The senior before the stone tablet directly said. </p><p></p><p>"As for other matters regarding the Xuantian Sect..." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt that the baby, who was peacefully sleeping with closed eyes, seemed to smile at him. </p><p></p><p>"I don't know." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt bewildered by this abrupt response. </p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Sect, taking the place of heaven. Even the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao ended up in such a state, let alone me, this little broken stone tablet." </p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, I really miss that time. Although it was as good as being blind with both eyes closed, it was really quiet." </p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for being forced by others, I really didn't want to get involved in that hustle and bustle." </p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately..." </p><p></p><p>The tone of the senior before the stone tablet suddenly turned, "However, if you now wish to rejoin the Xuantian Sect, maybe I can help you out." </p><p></p><p>"I don't ask for anything else, just hoping for some peace of mind for a while." </p><p></p><p>As he spoke, a map appeared on the ground in front of Li Fan. </p><p></p><p>Familiar with the geographical features of the Xuanhuang Realm, Li Fan immediately recognized the location depicted on the map. </p><p></p><p>"Go there and take a look, maybe you will gain something." </p><p></p><p>With that said, Li Fan felt his vision blur. </p><p></p><p>The next moment, he appeared outside a dilapidated temple. </p><p></p><p>Clearly, this was the territory of their Multiverse Alliance, but the senior before the stone tablet took the lead and expelled him! </p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, Li Fan was not angered. </p><p></p><p>He galloped towards the address on the stone tablet. </p><p></p><p>With the current situation easing, he did not encounter any special circumstances along the way. </p><p></p><p>However, the number of patrolling arrows in the sky seemed to increase. </p><p></p><p>Originally, there were only a handful of celestial patrol arrows in the entire realm of the Ten Immortals Association. </p><p></p><p>But now, at least three patrols were constantly circling over each state. </p><p></p><p>It is evident that during this time, the military development of the Ten Immortals Association had reached a terrifying level. </p><p></p><p>Fortunately, these patrol arrows did not attack indiscriminately. They seemed to have a unique way of distinguishing cultivators, only targeting the Five Elders' disciples. </p><p></p><p>And with a secret technique by his side, Li Fan managed to travel all the way without incident. </p><p></p><p>Soon, Li Fan arrived at his destination. </p><p></p><p>A circular mountain, inside its mouth, instead of scorching magma, bloomed with various flowers. </p><p></p><p>However, it was just an illusion when viewed from a distance. </p><p></p><p>In reality, these flowers were formed by the diffusion of a special spiritual power. </p><p></p><p>This kind of spiritual power could not be absorbed by cultivators, evolving into various flower patterns in the air. </p><p></p><p>Located in the Dongyong Continent, this was not considered a remote place. </p><p></p><p>Thanks to the unique beauty of this place, it always attracted many people to come and admire it. </p><p></p><p>When Li Fan arrived, he could even see groups of cultivators coming in pairs or in threes. </p><p></p><p>"I really enjoy being a riddle to people, why did they ask me to come here?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 732</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"If not, these prodigies from the Lijie Realm wouldn't even be comparable to Sun Erlang and Wang Xuanba, two young gentlemen from the Great Xuan Realm."</p><p></p><p>Initially, Li Fan personally verified their cultivation talents.</p><p></p><p>But they could only barely cultivate, definitely not on par with the people from the Lijie Realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, they unknowingly surpassed them...</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's mind, the volcano in the center of the Great Departure suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>From the moment he entered the Lijie Realm, he had a vague feeling that there was something wrong with that volcano.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to his lack of realm and vision, he had explored it several times before but couldn't figure out the trick inside.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the entrance to the Lijie Realm in this world has already been swallowed by spatial rifts and can no longer be entered."</p><p></p><p>"However, when I go again in the next life, I will pay more attention."</p><p></p><p>Thinking so, Li Fan waved his hand lightly, causing Su Changyu, Su Xiaomei, and others to appear in front of him out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>The alertness of the group was noticeably weaker compared to previous lives, taking them a few moments to come back to their senses. After seeing Li Fan in front of them, they hurriedly saluted, "Greetings, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan swept his gaze over them and then asked in a deep voice, "I brought you out of the mortal world more than ten years ago. First, I imprisoned you on an island, and then brought you to this Changsheng Valley, never allowing you to leave... Do you have any grievances?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Feipeng was the first to respond, "How could we have any grievances towards Master? We have lived very happily these years. Especially in this Changsheng Valley and the Beast Clan Realm. In your eyes, Master, they may be just small places, but to us, they are bigger than our homeland."</p><p></p><p>He flattered.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Heng agreed immediately, and the rest followed suit.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Li Fan continued, "Currently, the external Xuanhuang Realm is undergoing unprecedented changes, with countless opportunities. It is the time for you to make great strides. Pack up, tomorrow, leave the valley."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the expressions on everyone's faces froze. However, before they could react, Li Fan waved his sleeve and left on his own, leaving Ye Feipeng and the others staring at each other.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, they did not dare to disobey Master Li Fan's orders and could only accept this reality with a sense of helplessness. With a despondent face, they quickly went to seek help from the disciples of the Pharmacists Sect they were familiar with.</p><p></p><p>"I hope that after they return home, they can bring me some surprises. Otherwise, there may be something strange in the Departure Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's killing intent locked onto everyone, and then he quietly returned to the closed-door chamber in the Changsheng Valley.</p><p></p><p>"Fusheng, the Xuanhuang Celestial!"</p><p></p><p>After preparing the ceremony, Li Fan once again entered the Immortal Falling realm in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, he directly chose the scene of forging swords in the Tianjian Sect.</p><p></p><p>The scene before him distorted and blurred, followed by an angry shout in his ears.</p><p></p><p>"Ji Zhaoxuan! Why didn't you hand over the Sword Embryo again this time?"</p><p></p><p>"Delaying Master Brother's plan, can you bear the consequences?"</p><p></p><p>The memories rushed in like a tide, and Li Fan instantly understood his current situation.</p><p></p><p>Since Mr. Bai left, the Tianjian Sect had formulated the idea of forging the Divine Weapon of the Ruptured Realm.</p><p></p><p>It required the disciples to extract insights from the wooden sword and inject them into the elemental stone called the "Sword Embryo". This was then put into a deep pit on the back mountain to be forged into the prototype of the Divine Weapon of the Ruptured Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was the case for everyone in the Tianjian Sect.</p><p></p><p>The disciples, elders, and even the strongest "Master Brother," Situ Yao, were no exception.</p><p></p><p>And the golden core cultivator Ji Zhaoxuan who Li Fan possessed had failed to hand over the Sword Embryo on time several times.</p><p></p><p>Hence the scene before him where he was being questioned.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained calm, arching his hand, "I hope Brother Chu can give me a few more days! I have blunt talents, and the processes of comprehension and purification are slower for me compared to others."</p><p></p><p>Brother Chu glanced at Li Fan, snorted coldly, "This is the last time. Don't think I don't know what schemes you're up to. The way you condense Qi into a sword is contrary to the process of injecting sword intent into the Sword Embryo. Every moment the Sword Embryo stays in your body brings great benefits to you, doesn't it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly revealed his panic at being exposed, hastily saying, "Brother Chu..."</p><p></p><p>Chu waved his hand, his expression turning cold, "It's not that I disregard brotherly affection. Between personal cultivation and the future of the Tianjian Sect, you should understand which is more important!"</p><p></p><p>"I will return in two days. Take care of yourself!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Brother Chu turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the whispers and glances of the other disciples around, Li Fan's anxious expression disappeared as he returned to his room.</p><p></p><p>After checking his internal condition, he understood.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, this possession is not on some ordinary individual."</p><p></p><p>Inside Ji Zhaoxuan's dantian, a grey mist like a gaseous planet, the "Golden Core," continuously emitted grey gas.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, extremely exquisite sword insights emerged in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Compared to comprehending by touching the wooden sword, these were purer and more powerful.</p><p></p><p>This was why Ji Zhaoxuan had repeatedly delayed handing over the Sword Embryo.</p><p></p><p>Each time he obtained a piece of the Sword Embryo, he had to absorb it himself, convert it into what he had learned, and then deliver it to the Tianjian Sect.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the sword talent of this body definitely belonged to the top-tier geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, even with this, it was slow to decipher the true meaning within the Sword Embryo.</p><p></p><p>It took quite a bit of time each time, and from an outsider’s perspective, his speed of condensing the Sword Embryo appeared much slower.</p><p></p><p>Even Brother Chu could only see that he could gain advantages and improve his cultivation by extracting insights from the Sword Embryo.</p><p></p><p>But he never expected that Ji Zhaoxuan could directly utilize the true meaning within the Sword Embryo.</p><p></p><p>"As for the forging plans of the Tianjian Sect, this body doesn't care at all."</p><p></p><p>"Because he is essentially a genius spy."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan absorbed the Sword Embryo while reflecting on the memories that had suddenly appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>On a certain night, unnoticed by anyone, Ji Zhaoxuan had secretly transmitted everything that had happened recently in the Tianjian Sect to the outside world using a secret technique.</p><p></p><p>To whom it was transmitted, he had no answer in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Even the reason why Ji Zhaoxuan did this himself was unclear to him.</p><p></p><p>It was just that one day, as if being controlled, he autonomously took such action.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Ji Zhaoxuan himself had not noticed anything abnormal.</p><p></p><p>"To deceive even oneself—indeed, this can be considered as a superior espionage technique."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"The matter of the Tianjian Sect's sword forging will probably become known very soon."</p><p></p><p>"Next, it may not be so peaceful."</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to the scene of the destruction of the Sacred Beast Mountain and the tearing of the Xuanhuang Realm, Li Fan thought so.</p>

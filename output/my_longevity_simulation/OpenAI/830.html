        <h1>Chapter 830</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>But they all started to collect and inquire about the content of the previous entrance exam for the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Rubbing his hands together, he vowed to become a member of the Immortal Alliance system.</p><p></p><p>A crisis sufficient to cause internal chaos was quietly resolved in this way.</p><p></p><p>The means of resolution were so ingenious that even after almost half a month had passed, Li Fan couldn't help but review and sigh to himself.</p><p></p><p>"With just a raise of the hand and a gesture, the crisis vanishes into thin air."</p><p></p><p>"All that is needed is just a notice."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sincerely praised in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, he couldn't think of a better way to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>"The entrance exam in six months is so grand. How can I not take part..."</p><p></p><p>"However, even though this world has not started for long, the direction has already started to shift significantly. Those test questions should have also changed."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, the information of the past entrance exam questions that Li Fan had collected flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Things change while staying the same. Although it's impossible to accurately predict the questions, it's not difficult to create a rough question bank."</p><p></p><p>He took out a blank jade slip and a crystalline stone road appeared in his mind, suddenly bursting with a blue light.</p><p></p><p>Then a massive amount of data poured into the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>It took a full cup of tea's time for all the data to be transmitted.</p><p></p><p>"Upgrading to a middle-grade stone road really improves efficiency a lot. The computing power has more than doubled."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's finger ran across the smooth surface of the jade slip, nodding in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>The stone road finally advanced, thanks not only to his relentless perseverance in integrating it into the Yin Yin Tomb during each reincarnation, but also crucially to the lower-grade stone road provided by the Five Elders in this transaction.</p><p></p><p>Although both were of low grade, this one was much better than the one in the Yin Yin Tomb, almost approaching a middle-grade existence.</p><p></p><p>After devouring it, Li Fan's spiritual knowledge immediately jumped to the middle grade.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the Five Elders were only willing to provide this one. Even the Celestial Creator was not willing to give me more stone roads."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that they also have special uses?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned in thought, but after a moment, he understood.</p><p></p><p>Although the Celestial Creator was extremely precious, it was still reproduceable. Comparing it to a stone road where using one less meant having one less, it's hard to say which one is more valuable.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the Immortal Alliance entrance exam question bank. I should be able to exchange this with them for something."</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's planting spies or causing disruptions, there is much to do."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan calculated in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Shentian!"</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he shouted.</p><p></p><p>A figure flashed by, and Shentian immediately came buzzing over to Li Fan. </p><p></p><p>With Lin Ling's presence, the previously brainwashed young man, who had already been successfully manipulated by Li Fan, was now even more obedient to Li Fan's every word. He endeavored to showcase himself in every possible way.</p><p></p><p>The previous outings were no longer mere sightseeing. After swiftly visiting all the necessary scenic spots, he hurried back without stopping.</p><p></p><p>It's fortunate that he could use the Sky Scenic Gourd for transmission, otherwise such a long-distance travel in such a short time might have worn him out completely.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had put in so much effort, the arrival of Tianyang still made him feel extremely threatened.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Shentian, who constantly flattered and offered his services, Lin Ling was more interested in the seemingly dull Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>This made Shentian very anxious. He had to choose another approach, trying to please Li Fan and salvage the situation.</p><p></p><p>"What orders do you have, Senior?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan threw the jade slip in his hand over and said, "Make a hundred copies of this jade slip."</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Shentian, who didn't think it was a hard task, immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>However, when he took it and carefully examined the contents of the jade slip, he couldn't help but exclaim in pain and cover his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Then he said in a loud voice, "Senior, isn't this too much!"</p><p></p><p>"If it's not too much, I would have done it myself. Why do I need you?" Li Fan coldly snorted.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, it's urgent. Get it done within seven days."</p><p></p><p>Shentian's face turned bitter, looking at Li Fan's serious expression, he dare not resist. He gritted his teeth and went to work.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then looked out at the tree people toiling on the land of the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, it seems that these tree people creations are not within the scope of the Immortal Decree."</p><p></p><p>Compared to when Li Fan had just entered the Spirit Wood, the overall strength of these tree people had significantly improved.</p><p></p><p>The largest group had grown from the Qi Refinement stage to a strength equivalent to the Qi Condensation stage.</p><p></p><p>The female leader of the tree people had gained the most benefits.</p><p></p><p>She could now compete evenly with ordinary Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p></p><p>This remarkable progress was partly due to Shentian's continuous transport of the mysterious Huang wonders.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, it was the treasure brought in this transaction by the Five Elders: the "Heavenly Dew Earth Droplets."</p><p></p><p>This item was the treasure of the ancient Divine Tree Sect, and for plants in the world, it had miraculous effects that other treasures could not compare to.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was only a drop, the spiritual tree's size had once again doubled.</p><p></p><p>The canopy had reached the sky, almost piercing through the sky.</p><p></p><p>With this transformation, Lin Ling also gained the most benefits.</p><p></p><p>From barely having the strength equivalent to the Harmonization realm when first born, it had now firmly stabilized in the Harmonization realm, all within just a couple of months.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about how the Elder Ge Old Tree had secretly taken care of it...</p><p></p><p>"It truly is the case that some people are naturally gifted."</p><p></p><p>"Even if I want to form a Yuanying, it is proving to be quite cumbersome."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Li Fan also faintly felt that when resources reach a certain level, cultivating a certain strength in cultivators was a very simple matter.</p><p></p><p>"Prominent families in the Immortal Alliance must not be as simple as they appear on the surface."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan focused his attention on the tree people all around the world.</p><p></p><p>Their tasks were generally divided into two parts.</p><p></p><p>One part was responsible for constructing the buildings of the "Multiverse Joint Council."</p><p></p><p>And the other tree people were tasked with transporting various materials and placing them at designated locations in the Spirit Wood Realm for the "Array Refinement" prelude.</p><p></p><p>"Array Refinement" was a way of refining magical treasures.</p><p></p><p>It involved completely refining a magical treasure, in addition to the usual fire refinement and refining with blood, there was this special method.</p><p></p><p>This method was mostly used by array masters.</p><p></p><p>Complex arrays were inscribed on the magic treasure.</p><p></p><p>This not only allowed the treasure to be completely owned but also enhanced the power of the treasure with the array.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not proficient in the art of refining tools, so he would not rush to learn the art just for refining a magic treasure.</p><p></p><p>With the possession of the End-of-Terminator Disk, the "Array Refinement" was naturally the most suitable method.</p><p></p><p>However, after several transformations in the Spirit Wood Realm, it had become much broader than ordinary small worlds.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Mo Rubin pondered for a moment and nodded, "Xingwang is right. Such a powerful weapon should not leak out. When I go back, I will make arrangements."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan seized the opportunity to emit a deep, sinister chuckle.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Brother Xingwang, besides strengthening the Xuantian Locking Shadow Formation, I also need your help with one more thing. It concerns the Xuantian Treasure Mirror. After much thought, I feel only your assistance will put my mind at ease," Mo Rubin suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, we are brothers, no need to be so formal," Li Fan said, somewhat displeased as he glared at Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>This matter seemed even more important, Mo Rubin contemplated for a moment and then laid down another layer of restrictions around them.</p><p></p><p>He then whispered, "According to my latest investigation, during the years the Xuantian Treasure Mirror was in the hands of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, it is very likely that a human avatar was formed due to division. I need you to find this avatar, slay it, and cut off its retreat completely!" A hint of killing intent flashed in Mo Rubin's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan also looked extremely surprised.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Treasure Mirror formed a human avatar? How is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin said in a deep voice, "When I first heard about this, I was also shocked. But later, I thought, perhaps it is because of the semi-coerced, semi-cooperative factors that the Xuantian Treasure Mirror fully integrated with the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance. A spiritual artifact will naturally not want to be enslaved forever. The division of a human body, attempting to break free, is quite reasonable."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xingwang, rest assured, to prevent the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance from noticing, the strength of the human avatar formed by the Xuantian Treasure Mirror should not be too powerful. With your strength, as long as you successfully locate and slay it, you will definitely succeed."</p><p></p><p>"I will lend you another magic treasure to ensure worry-free success." With that, Mo Rubin brought out a pitch-black metal book.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Ink Stain Evil Book, which is very effective against spiritual treasures and magic tools. Once it locks onto the target, it will emit endless ink lights, contaminating it. With this treasure in hand, Brother Xingwang, there is no possibility of failure."</p><p></p><p>"However, it's just a mere avatar. Even without this Ink Stain Evil Book, I could still slay it," although Li Fan said so, he still put away the black book.</p><p></p><p>But then he furrowed his brows, "The key is where to find the avatar of the Xuantian Treasure Mirror? It must be very well hidden, so do we have enough time?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin assured, "The Law Transmitters have long been aware of the division of the Xuantian Treasure Mirror. Therefore, they have been conducting secret investigations for a long time, but without any concrete results. However, recently, a subordinate of Law Transmitter Feng finally found decisive evidence. So far, only I know about this matter, it has not been reported to the Law Transmitters' council."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Li Fan showed interest.</p><p></p><p>"The control of the Xuantian Treasure Mirror has always been in the hands of the mirror keeper. Without the cooperation of an insider, it would be impossible for an avatar to form. It has been preliminarily determined that one of the mirror keepers, [Cang], is the traitor!"</p><p></p><p>"The daughter of Cang, named Feixue Xianzun, is quite famous in the Immortals Alliance. Several years ago, this woman inexplicably became pregnant and gave birth to a son. I suspect that it may have something to do with the Xuantian Treasure Mirror!" Mo Rubin explained.</p><p></p><p>"Are you saying that the son of that Feixue Xianzun is the avatar of the Xuantian Treasure Mirror?" Li Fan squinted his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The image of Shuofeng flashed in his mind instantly.</p><p></p><p>"It's not impossible. But back then, Feixue first held a martial arts competition to find a husband and caused a sensation. Then, she suddenly became pregnant, causing a commotion... It was too high-profile. It's like intentionally performing to attract attention. So it's also possible that it was a calculated move to hide the true avatar of the Xuantian Treasure Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, no matter what, they are definitely related to the Xuantian Realm. Recently, we discovered that in the data of Feixue in the mirror, there was a change in a privilege that only the Xuantian Treasure Mirror could modify, without any record of modification in the mirror."</p><p></p><p>"Now, I think the best course of action will be to wait until they meet and capture them all at once," Mo Rubin said in a deep tone.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"As long as we kill the avatar of the Xuantian Treasure Mirror, cut off its retreat, and force it with a Soul Sealing Formation, we can then negotiate with the Xuantian Treasure Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, this guy will remain arrogant," Mo Rubin's tone carried a hint of displeasure.</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant." Li Fan recalled the very familiar cold mechanical voice of the Xuantian Realm.</p><p></p><p>The two continued to discuss the details of their plan, and eventually, Mo Rubin prepared to leave.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to leave the hidden cave, Li Fan suddenly asked, "After thousands of years, we are reunited now. Why not re-enter the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal Sect together?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the phantom of a faceless stone statue appeared in the air.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin looked up and subconsciously stepped back slightly.</p><p></p><p>A trace of barely noticeable fear flashed in his eyes, but Mo Rubin remained silent.</p><p></p><p>He just shook his head and then drifted away.</p><p></p><p>"Before leaving, Xingwang, take a closer look at this cave. Perhaps you will find something useful."</p><p></p><p>The voice echoed slowly in the cave as Mo Rubin's figure had already disappeared from sight.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Li Fan began to inspect the cave once again.</p>

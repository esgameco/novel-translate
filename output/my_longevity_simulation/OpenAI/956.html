        <h1>Chapter 956</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Eyes still closed, the voice sounded eerie, sometimes loud, sometimes soft.</p><p></p><p>"Who am I?"</p><p></p><p>"... Can you guess?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he clenched his left hand abruptly.</p><p></p><p>In the Cloud-Water Heaven Palace where there was already dead silence, with the exception of Hanhai and Taiyi, there were no other survivors, the painful agonizing cries of the disciples before their deaths suddenly resonated simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Hanhai, pinned in midair and unable to move, witnessed transparent figures rising from the disciples' mutilated corpses.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if they were still lingering in the moment before death, their faces filled with horror and despair.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, ah, ah..."</p><p></p><p>What the "Tianzun" did was not simply to "kill" them, but to make the disciples of the Cloud-Water Heaven Palace live eternally in the agony and torment of that moment before death!</p><p></p><p>What kind of deep hatred led to such a cruel act?</p><p></p><p>Filled with sorrow and indignation, Hanhai erupted with all his strength, trying to break free from the control.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't even shake the black rays piercing through his body, and he ended up bleeding profusely from his seven orifices, in a miserable state!</p><p></p><p>Helplessly, Hanhai could only watch as the person before him transformed all the deceased disciples into tragic and eerie existences, neither completely dead nor truly alive!</p><p></p><p>"Tianzun, the master of extermination."</p><p></p><p>"Such methods are definitely beyond her capabilities."</p><p></p><p>"No, no..."</p><p></p><p>Hanhai's eyes lost focus as he muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, it seemed like he remembered something as his body slightly trembled. "Tianyi? Are you Tianyi!?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Hanhai's words, the figure tormenting the disciples of the Cloud-Water Heaven Palace also paused for a moment, and then a strange smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Tianyi..."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, that's right. I am Tianyi!"</p><p></p><p>With these words, Hanhai's world suddenly changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>The assailant who appeared as "Tianzun" instantly transformed into Tianyi's appearance!</p><p></p><p>Full of compassion and righteousness, yet carrying out such horrifying deeds!</p><p></p><p>The black swords of light that trapped Hanhai also turned into black needles!</p><p></p><p>"So it is!"</p><p></p><p>"Why, Tianyi!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking he had unravelled the truth, Hanhai let out a thunderous roar of anger.</p><p></p><p>"Why! Why!"</p><p></p><p>He kept questioning.</p><p></p><p>However, Tianyi seemed unaffected, with a look of appreciation in his murky eyes, watching the disciples of the Cloud-Water Heaven Palace who "died and resurrected" as if admiring his own masterpiece.</p><p></p><p>The newly reborn disciples were initially confused, looking at their somewhat transparent bodies and then scanning their surroundings. However, gradually, they began to understand what was happening to them.</p><p></p><p>The enraged screams from Hanhai made them realize who was responsible for all of this.</p><p></p><p>"Tianyi!"</p><p></p><p>"Tianyi!"</p><p></p><p>The resentful shouts echoed throughout the Cloud-Water Heaven Palace, sending chills down everyone's spines.</p><p></p><p>While the disciples longed to devour Tianyi's flesh in anger, they were still under his control, only able to futilely howl without being able to make any resistance.</p><p></p><p>After what seemed like an eternity, Tianyi's expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>With a cold snort, an endless darkness engulfed the disciples of the Cloud-Water Heaven Palace.</p><p></p><p>The scene abruptly cut off.</p><p></p><p>When the light reappeared, they were back to the moment when Hanhai was conversing with Taiyi in the main hall.</p><p></p><p>"It seems like this nightmarish memory is the source of Hanhai's torment," Li Fan contemplated to himself.</p><p></p><p>Viewing the memory once again from Hanhai's perspective and confirming that there were no abnormalities, Li Fan's consciousness wanted to leave this place.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, he could not find a way out!</p><p></p><p>The scene here had become so close to reality, constantly cycling back and forth.</p><p></p><p>One could still awaken from illusions or memories, but how could one return from reality to reality?</p><p></p><p>With the connection to the outside world severed, Li Fan tried various methods to leave, all futile.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan remained calm.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was only a strand of his consciousness that came here.</p><p></p><p>For his original self, the wound caused by losing this strand of consciousness would heal in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Normally, since it seemed hopeless to escape and wouldn't harm his original self, Li Fan's consciousness could just self-destruct and be done with it.</p><p></p><p>However, driven by the instinct for survival, the consciousness that Li Fan had separated still wanted to give it another try.</p><p></p><p>See if there was a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"Even I, an outsider, cannot escape from this eternal nightmare. Let alone the owner Hanhai here."</p><p></p><p>"But the reasons behind this situation are worth pondering. Is it because Hanhai has been too traumatized and cannot break free on his own? Orâ€¦"</p><p></p><p>Though surprised, Li Fan continued to experience the nightmare from Hanhai's point of view.</p><p></p><p>Reliving the hellish scenes once again, the cold snort of Tianyi and the arrival of darkness.</p><p></p><p>Focused, Li Fan looked into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>The darkness lasted only for a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>At first glance, it seemed like pure darkness due to the lack of memories. </p><p></p><p>In the previous segment, Hanhai had been forcefully blocked from perceiving the outside world.</p><p></p><p>What followed was the cycle of nightmares.</p><p></p><p>However, with both scenarios appearing as complete darkness, Hanhai, who was in a frenzied state, couldn't distinguish between the two.</p><p></p><p>Only an outsider like Li Fan could faintly perceive the subtle differences between them.</p><p></p><p>Even if Li Fan hadn't been deeply moved by the tragic events at the Cloud-Water Heaven Palace and could maintain an absolute calm, it would have been challenging for him to notice the disparities between the two.</p><p></p><p>Having found a point of entry, Li Fan's consciousness patiently waited in the cycle of nightmares.</p><p></p><p>Attempting to break through the darkness and witness what was happening in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the 'Tianyi' person did not stop just because he got bored. That slight change in his expression..."</p><p></p><p>"Someone has arrived."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>After enduring hundreds of cycles with patience, Li Fan slowly pieced together what happened during that moment of darkness that blocked him.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after Tianyi suppressed everyone in the Cloud-Water Heaven Palace, a figure swiftly flew in from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Tianyi's face showed a mocking expression, his figure faded away, disappearing without a trace.</p>

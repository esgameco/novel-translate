        <div class="content">
            <p>Although the two attackers that came only revealed their Nascent Soul cultivation, they were as solid as a rock, standing tall against the endless beast tide's attacks without falling. In fact, they grew stronger as the battle progressed!</p><p></p><p>The bleak roars of the beasts echoed throughout the entire beast realm.</p><p></p><p>The color of the sky changed as a huge vortex formed above the central black tower.</p><p></p><p>Within the vortex, a faint shadow of a black mysterious bird could be seen.</p><p></p><p>The faces of Tianyang and Lin Ling turned serious for the first time.</p><p></p><p>But just that.</p><p></p><p>Similar to the outcome of Lao Liu of the previous generation of Medicine King Sect sweeping through this realm.</p><p></p><p>Even with the utilization of the residual illusion of Little Black, summoning the will of the beast realm to fight against the enemies.</p><p></p><p>However, under the joint effort of the two cultivators, they were quickly suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Following Li Fan's instructions, they killed the most powerful few exotic beasts, extracted their cores, and then marked off an area, concentrating the remaining beast species for rearing.</p><p></p><p>After that, the two of them began the next action.</p><p></p><p>They transferred the entrance to the beast realm to the Lingmu realm.</p><p></p><p>With the experience of transferring the entrance of the Five Elements Great Cave into the past, they quickly completed the mission this time.</p><p></p><p>Oudaozi had set aside an area while designing the headquarters of the "All Realms Association".</p><p></p><p>To place the entrances leading to various realms.</p><p></p><p>At this point, it was not yet in full scale, but when more small worlds were connected in the future, it would truly live up to the name of the "All Realms Union".</p><p></p><p>Of course, safety had to be considered.</p><p></p><p>The more entrances, the larger the potential flaws.</p><p></p><p>Oudaozi considered a solution of nested space, planning to divide the area with entrances to various realms into relatively independent nested spaces that could be abandoned at any time.</p><p></p><p>In case of unforeseen circumstances, one could seek survival by parting ways.</p><p></p><p>However, this was still at the conceptual stage.</p><p></p><p>Although Tianyang had swallowed the "Inkstone," to freely cut space, it would still require some time to familiarize oneself with.</p><p></p><p>Some matters were urgent.</p><p></p><p>When the connection between the beast realm and the Lingmu realm was completed, Tianyang first arrived at Lijie according to Li Fan's instructions.</p><p></p><p>By this time, the beast cores in the "Xianling Tower" left by Li Fan had been almost exhausted.</p><p></p><p>With no spiritual energy production, the cultivation of those in Lijie was gradually reaching a deadlock.</p><p></p><p>The exploration of the Fire World was still in its initial stage.</p><p></p><p>Helpless, Su Yuqing asked Li Fan for help through a communication talisman.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang did not hide his aura.</p><p></p><p>After revealing himself, the pressure of the joint cultivators made the whole Lijie seem as if it was covered by thick dark clouds.</p><p></p><p>Those who were unaware showed fear on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Only Su Yuqing was pleasantly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Facing the respectful Su Yuqing, Tianyang remained silent.</p><p></p><p>After quietly helping the Xianling Tower to resume operation, he then connected Lijie with the Lingmu realm.</p><p></p><p>"When the aura of Xianling is depleted again in the future, you can go to the beast realm to hunt and replenish the necessary beast cores."</p><p></p><p>"The beast realm is not like Lijie, you need to increase your cultivation as much as possible. You can apply for the necessary treasures and techniques from the headquarters of the Union."</p><p></p><p>Tianyang's words were concise.</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Initially, Li Fan had considered directly infusing the Lingmu realm's spiritual energy into Lijie.</p><p></p><p>However, after careful consideration, he vetoed it.</p><p></p><p>After all, the majority of small worlds did not have spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>If the Lingmu realm could nourish one realm, what about ten or a hundred realms?</p><p></p><p>It was better to transform each realm gradually through the Xianling Tower.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this required almost astronomical supplies of beast cores.</p><p></p><p>After the breakthrough, Li Fan planned to take Tianyang to the Empire.</p><p></p><p>The All Realms Union was flourishing and steadily developing.</p><p></p><p>Haixuan Island.</p><p></p><p>It was consistent with Jishao Li's predictions.</p><p></p><p>Compared to previous years, this time, there were more than twice as many positions provided.</p><p></p><p>Even the overall treatment of the cultivators within the Immortal Alliance system had seen a significant increase.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators eagerly signed up, hoping for a change in their destiny.</p><p></p><p>But Hao Zhenghao, who was well-prepared and confident, seemed somewhat uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have something on your mind, Daoist He?" asked Jishao Li.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao seemed as if he didn't hear anything, lost in his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist He!" Jishao Li furrowed his brows and called out again.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao then came back to his senses.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that you are hiding something from us, Daoist He," Jishao Li smiled.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's abnormal behavior had started two days ago when he returned from Wanxian Island.</p><p></p><p>Due to the shared secret he carried, the cultivators present at the Mutual Aid Meeting now realized something.</p><p></p><p>All of them stared at He Zhenghao with unfriendly expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Misunderstanding, just a misunderstanding!" He Zhenghao smiled bitterly and quickly explained.</p><p></p><p>"It's not what everyone thinks. The reason I've been so distracted recently..."</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a moment, he reluctantly took out a sketchbook.</p><p></p><p>His face reddened: "The culprit is this thing."</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at each other in confusion.</p><p></p><p>Jishao Li remained composed on the surface but felt a sinking feeling inside.</p><p></p><p>After taking a glance at the sketchbook and quickly skimming through the first few pages, he packed it away abruptly.</p><p></p><p>"Where did you get this item from?" Jishao Li asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The sketchbook contained the wonderful stories of the "One-Hearted Celestial Venerable."</p><p></p><p>Although not as intense as the illusions Li Fan had experienced, the stories were almost real.</p><p></p><p>No wonder He Zhenghao had seemed so lost in the past few days.</p><p></p><p>"I got it from a good friend of mine. He was very secretive about it, saying it was something good. He even charged me five hundred contribution points."</p><p></p><p>"Although this sketchbook is indeed quite good."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao muttered under his breath.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is it?"</p><p></p><p>With He Zhenghao's words, the curiosity of the people present grew even more.</p><p></p><p>Focusing on He Zhenghao, all of them were increasingly intrigued.</p><p></p><p>Jishao Li only showed a part of the sketchbook to everyone.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators who had initially mocked: "Daoist He, as a Foundation Building cultivator, how could you be so captivated by this thing?" were taken aback when He Zhenghao retorted and revealed the true identity of the sketchbook's protagonist.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators present were in shock, their gazes towards Jishao Li, who held the sketchbook, instantly changing.</p><p></p><p>Jishao Li snorted and snapped them out of their reverie with a few words.</p><p></p><p>"Unified in mind...?"</p><p></p><p>"Can one be assimilated if indulging too deeply in it?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone's faces turned pale.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's body was trembling uncontrollably, petrified on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"It's fortunate you didn't fall too deeply."</p><p></p><p>"Daoist He, you should immediately go into seclusion now and eliminate all distractions in your mind," Jishao Li ordered sternly.</p><p></p><p>Being flustered, He Zhenghao subconsciously obeyed Jishao Li's command.</p><p></p><p>After confining He Zhenghao to a dark room to face the wall, and comforting the others, Jishao Li began to investigate.</p>

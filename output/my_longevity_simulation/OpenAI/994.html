        <h1>Chapter 994</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>There is not much information about Cang.</p><p></p><p>Just knowing that Cang is also a survivor after the great calamity. When the Law Transmission Heavenly Venerable re-established the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals, in addition to the Law Transmitters responding one after another, this "he who recognizes the times is a hero" Cang also rose to fame for pledging allegiance at the very first moment.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the analysis within the Law Transmitters regarding Cang indicates that this person must have other factors contributing to his appointment as the Mirror Keeper. He must have very special reasons to be chosen by the Law Transmission Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>As for Cang’s daughter, Feixue Xianzun Xuansu, the information becomes much clearer.</p><p></p><p>Xuansu was born before Cang joined the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals. Her mother died protecting Cang in a fight among practitioners when she was very young.</p><p></p><p>Father and daughter depended on each other, and therefore, Cang had great affection for Xuansu.</p><p></p><p>Especially after Cang gradually gained power, he became even more generous with rewards for Xuansu.</p><p></p><p>According to incomplete statistics, in just the central four states of the Immortal Alliance, Xuansu's caves, territories, total over two hundred large and small locations.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the tributes from various families attached to Xuansu.</p><p></p><p>It is said that Xuansu's cultivation talent is actually average, but at her level, even if the talent is poor, it can be supplemented with ample resources, especially under the new law framework.</p><p></p><p>Xuansu successfully cultivated to the Harmony Realm. </p><p></p><p>It is said that on the day of refining the soul of Heaven and Earth, Feixue, Cang sent out five Harmony Realm experts to protect her, ensuring no unforeseen incidents occur.</p><p></p><p>After Xuansu ascended to the Harmony Realm, she finally gained a bit more freedom.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Cang did not allow her to leave the jurisdiction of the central four states of the Immortal Alliance. Wherever she went, someone would always be following her.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, after her liberation, Xuansu spent almost a hundred years traveling through the majority of the territories of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>During this time, her specific whereabouts could only be roughly investigated.</p><p></p><p>After having her fun, Xuansu finally settled down. Perhaps out of interest, she began to devote herself to the path of refining. The Immortal Forge Hall was entirely open to her, allowing Xuansu to learn the most advanced knowledge of refining within the Immortal Alliance. Her skills in refining also progressed rapidly. She became famous for successfully creating a set of battle armor that could withstand attacks from five Harmony Realm experts combined, and she became renowned throughout the land.</p><p></p><p>After this...</p><p></p><p>It seems that she got bored and started to keep a low profile.</p><p></p><p>Apart from occasionally hanging out with a few close friends like the Chief of the Formation Hall, Lu Xichan, she rarely appeared in the public eye.</p><p></p><p>Until she suddenly issued a marriage martial arts challenge, shaking the world once again.</p><p></p><p>And then no one responded, and it all ended with the bizarre incident of Xuansu inexplicably getting pregnant. </p><p></p><p>Xuansu's son is Shuofeng.</p><p></p><p>As if he appeared out of thin air, without being conceived for ten months, or any information about his father.</p><p></p><p>Just like Cang's somewhat abnormal affection for Xuansu, Xuansu's discipline towards Shuofeng is almost harsh.</p><p></p><p>According to the records, Shuofeng did not leave the cave in Tianquan Prefecture until the Nascent Soul stage, relying solely on the Tianxuan Mirror to peek into the outside world.</p><p></p><p>After Shuofeng successfully transformed into the Deity stage and fought hard, this situation was alleviated.</p><p></p><p>However, whenever Shuofeng goes outside, he must wear the golden battle armor specially crafted by Xuansu for him.</p><p></p><p>According to the secret investigation of the Law Transmitters, this golden battle armor not only boasts extraordinary defensive capabilities, able to withstand a combined attack from more than ten Harmony Realm practitioners but also defends the soul as strong as fortifying metal.</p><p></p><p>After the golden battle armor is damaged and disintegrated, it can directly transfer Shuofeng to a safe location.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Every once in a while, Shuofeng has to report and greet Feixue Xianzun."</p><p></p><p>"Although their meeting place is not fixed, they notify in advance. However, we can infer the most likely ones..."</p><p></p><p>"The next time should be after twenty-three days."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the names of the five caves circled on the document and could not help but sigh slightly. "Even at the rate I earn contribution points, it would probably take over a decade to buy such a cave."</p><p></p><p>"This kid, born with so much."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's mind again flashed Shuofeng’s face.</p><p></p><p>"At this time, he probably does not have plans to completely rebuild yet, still in the Deity stage."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what stimulated him to make such impulsive decisions."</p><p></p><p>"The most prudent way would be to wait in hiding at the Sword Tomb of the Sky Sword Sect, unexpectedly capture him unnoticed. Unfortunately, time is a bit tight. Plus, we have to capture Xuansu along..."</p><p></p><p>The blue light of the Xudao Stone kept flashing in Li Fan's mind as he, based on the various powers he held, started deducing.</p><p></p><p>"If it's just about trapping and capturing, there shouldn't be a problem."</p><p></p><p>"Even if I alone am barely enough, not to mention with Tianyang and Baihua assisting."</p><p></p><p>"Well... but I still have to take Moru Bin along."</p><p></p><p>The techniques and abilities used by Xuansu and Shuofeng while cultivating and practicing martial arts in the Tianxuan Mirror, as well as the general information on their cultivation methods, all appeared before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Comparing the strengths of both sides, various possible future scenarios kept flashing in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"As the direct descendant of the Mirror Keeper, they should be well aware that the information in the Tianxuan Mirror is by no means a secret. I believe their true strength is much more than what is revealed."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I also have many hidden cards."</p><p></p><p>After a day and night of deduction, Li Fan had almost figured out the plan for this assassination.</p><p></p><p>Next is waiting for the best opportunity to strike.</p><p></p><p>While waiting, Li Fan took out the Lifeless Array Crown given by Moru Bin and the Evil Bookseal to study.</p><p></p><p>The Lifeless Array Crown was like a living being. Under a rough scan of divine sense, the internal formation was like countless fierce beasts battling each other, devouring and evolving.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, its efficiency could not compare to the Nine-Disc Unification, but it provided Li Fan with some new inspiration.</p><p></p><p>If Moru Bin's attempt to unify the discs failed, perhaps splitting the final unification disc in two and having them confront each other might work.</p><p></p><p>Maybe deducing a new method would be more efficient.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan tried to feed the Lifeless Array Crown to the unification disc, but unfortunately, the disc showed no interest whatsoever. It didn't even bother to take a look.</p><p></p><p>It was feeling the aura of the final unification disc that the countless formations comprising the Lifeless Array Crown instantly became agitated.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly and directly suppressed and sealed this treasure.</p>

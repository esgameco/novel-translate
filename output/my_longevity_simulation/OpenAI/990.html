        <h1>Chapter 990</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This guy always manages to scare people with his words unintentionally.</p><p></p><p>"What's different about me?"</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daozhen explained slowly, "Perhaps the fact that you are the first person to come into contact with the true immortal stone statue again, or maybe the first person to revive the stone statue."</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, I believe the Heavenly Master has also noticed that, compared to others, you possess different powers."</p><p></p><p>"This is perhaps a performance of the true immortal showing special attention to you."</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daozhen tried to find ways and reasons to explain.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan just chuckled in response.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, the intentions of the true immortal are beyond our speculation."</p><p></p><p>"I am someone who always repays kindness. Since the true immortal has created me, regardless of the final outcome, I will take reviving the true immortal's heritage as my responsibility."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said with great righteousness, putting an end to the discussion about the true immortal between the two.</p><p></p><p>"I still don't know what you are good at. Since you have joined our Multiverse Alliance, we can't neglect your abilities."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, our alliance is still in a covert development stage, and I know your actual combat power is not strong, so I won't let you engage in battles with others." Li Fan asked very considerately.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's smiling expression, Baihua Daozhen suddenly had an inexplicable premonition. However, she still answered with a stiff face, "I have now transformed into a crystal body, excelling in two areas the most."</p><p></p><p>"One is soothing and repairing spiritual and soul injuries. But this requires the consumption of my essence and can only be done occasionally."</p><p></p><p>After paying respects to the true immortal stone statue, Baihua Daozhen realized that she had formed a connection with the statue. Li Fan could also sense her emotions through this.</p><p></p><p>So Baihua Daozhen dared not hide it and honestly confessed, "Secondly, I am good at nurturing and protecting spiritual plants, herbs, and the like. Not only can I make them more vibrant but also have a certain probability of giving birth to spirits."</p><p></p><p>"But I have observed that the spiritual energy in this realm is fully absorbed by the central spiritual wood, hence the scarcity of spiritual plants."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded, "Correct, the world of spiritual wood is indeed very desolate."</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daozhen breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"However, it doesn't matter. We have another base in the alliance that can definitely meet Baihua Daozhen's needs."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Baihua Daozhen's eyes blurred.</p><p></p><p>When she saw the scene clearly, her body couldn't help but tremble slightly again.</p><p></p><p>A towering giant tree much taller than the spiritual wood in the region stood in her view.</p><p></p><p>The giant tree did not drain the nutrients from the heavens and earth but instead formed miniature ecosystems around its roots and even on its branches, filled with countless plants, spiritual plants, and herbs.</p><p></p><p>They were densely packed, reaching all the way to the horizon.</p><p></p><p>Even with her divine consciousness, she couldn't see the end in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The extremely dense wood attribute spiritual energy almost suffocated Baihua Daozhen.</p><p></p><p>She had never seen such a stunning scene before; for a moment, she thought she was in the legendary fairy realm!</p><p></p><p>"Where is this?"</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Baihua Daozhen finally came back to her senses.</p><p></p><p>Not seeing Li Fan's figure, she looked around and asked.</p><p></p><p>"This is one of the secret bases of the Multiverse Alliance, the spiritual wood paradise."</p><p></p><p>"I believe the richness of the spiritual plants here is enough for Daoist Baihua to take care of."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's voice echoed thunderously in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daozhen opened her mouth, wanting to speak but hesitated.</p><p></p><p>With the spiritual energy of the wood so abundant here, did she even need to take care of it? Any plant she randomly picked would be top-notch material!</p><p></p><p>However, sensing a vague sense of threat from the other party, Baihua Daozhen could only say bitterly, "It's enough, more than enough."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, that's good. Although this paradise has slightly richer resources, it has been abandoned for a long time and is somewhat messy. You will have to take care of it carefully. It will serve as the logistics base for the alliance in the future; we must handle it cautiously." Li Fan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daozhen looked at the vast paradise with a numb expression and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"After careful management, even with my current abilities, it will take at least more than ten years?" Baihua Daozhen sighed.</p><p></p><p>"This Heavenly Master seems to be quite a smiling tiger."</p><p></p><p>However, with her essence bound by the true immortal stone statue and further being controlled by the other party, Baihua Daozhen had no choice but to work hard.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, she enjoyed dealing with these spiritual beings, and this paradise had not been disturbed by cultivators for many years. All the spiritual plants grew vigorously, which made her feel pity for them.</p><p></p><p>As she dealt with each area one by one, her mood gradually improved.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time had passed, her actions were interrupted by a resounding noise from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daozhen looked up and saw a huge landmass suddenly appearing and floating at the midsection of the giant tree.</p><p></p><p>It covered the sky like a dark cloud.</p><p></p><p>"If convenient, why not transplant everything on it into this paradise?"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Li Fan's aura disappeared once again.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daozhen was stunned and flew up into the sky, looking down and almost out of breath.</p><p></p><p>On this continent, mountains and valleys were still covered with medicinal herbs.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they were all very old.</p><p></p><p>"There are formations categorized according to different types, each having been planted for at least a few thousand years. They can be considered top-quality..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this Heavenly Master emptied some ancient immortal sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Dealing with all these will be more troublesome."</p><p></p><p>"Will the project duration increase by another five years?"</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daozhen sighed helplessly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sensed the Baihua Daozhen in her wood attribute paradise and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Although this Baihua Daozhen seemed completely submissive, she had been a long-lived cultivator who slept in the outside world for who knows how many years.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan still couldn't fully trust her.</p><p></p><p>Keeping her suppressed in his paradise while aiding in managing the disordered spiritual plants was truly a two-in-one benefit.</p><p></p><p>Since Li Fan devoured the Five Elements Great Paradise, his strength had improved. The Great Paradise continued to grow slowly, and the wood attribute paradise was further immersed in rampant growth.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daozhen's arrival was timely!</p><p></p><p>As for the continent full of spiritual plants that Li Fan later brought, it was the secret realm of the Medicine King Sect, the Valley of Longevity!</p><p></p><p>Anyway, it was destined to be Li Fan's possession, so he would transfer it to the wood attribute paradise for processing.</p><p></p><p>"The return of the Medicine King Cauldron is not far away."</p><p></p><p>"The shortage of manpower in the Multiverse Alliance will soon be alleviated."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's vision seemed to penetrate the barriers of the small world and extend to the sky of the Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>The waves caused by Baihua Daozhen's appearance gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>A month later, Moru Bin finally quietly contacted Li Fan.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 951</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Xin Hongzhang was about to agree, but at a critical moment, a stroke of good luck befell and he looked towards Li Fan. </p><p></p><p>"What would be the cost?" </p><p></p><p>"In this world, how could there be such a good thing as heavenly pie falling from the sky?" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the other party still stubbornly resisting, and smiled once again, "Cost? That saintly figure, originally could achieve a realm beyond immortality, but now can only suppress the myriad of gods and demons and endure the suffering himself..." </p><p></p><p>"Isn't that a cost? It's just that the saint is merciful and has shielded us from all disasters. If those gods and demons were still rampaging, to summon them back, it would surely require sacrificing one's own soul." </p><p></p><p>“If you truly feel grateful, you just need to praise the saint's grace daily.” </p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's explanation, everything suddenly made sense.  </p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang's doubts were all dispelled and he couldn't help but ask, "I wonder what is the name of that saint..." </p><p></p><p>"Learn the [Manifestation of God], and you will know." Li Fan said, pointing gently towards Xin Hongzhang. </p><p></p><p>The mysterious content of this magic of gods and demons instantly appeared in Xin Hongzhang's mind like a tide.</p><p></p><p>"It truly is an unparalleled wonderful method, indeed extraordinary!" </p><p></p><p>Just from reading between the lines, Xin Hongzhang glimpsed the profoundness of the [Manifestation of God]. Compared to the spells he had practiced in his entire life, it was simply like heaven and earth, one above, one below.</p><p></p><p>Immersed in this profound technique, he couldn't extricate himself. </p><p></p><p>When Xin Hongzhang came to his senses, Li Fan had already disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"Help the needy and pity the suffering," Xin Hongzhang muttered softly to himself.</p><p></p><p>Having obtained the secret technique, naturally, the first thing to do was to find a place to cultivate. </p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang suppressed his excitement, and returned to the fortress of Jiushanzhou.</p><p></p><p>He rented the most secretive practice chamber at a high cost, and Xin Hongzhang sat cross-legged in it, practicing according to the method described in [Manifestation of God].</p><p></p><p>Darkness descended quietly in the chamber. </p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang felt as if he had returned to the boundless devilish realm where myriad of demons resided.</p><p></p><p>However, unlike the terrible scenes of whistling winds and ghostly cries he had seen before, the devilish realm now seemed to be in absolute stillness. </p><p></p><p>Above the myriad gods and demons, there was a faint figure of a compassionate saint, emitting warm rays of light.</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang's fear gradually disappeared, and with a mix of excitement and reverence, he respectfully bowed towards the figure in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Then his divine thoughts wandered among the myriad gods and demons, constantly sensing.</p><p></p><p>When passing by one of the demon statues, there was a sudden movement in his mind. </p><p></p><p>Reciting incantations, the next moment, the statue abruptly opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>The static devilish realm shattered with a thunderous roar, and in reality, a majestic demon with eight heads and eight arms appeared in front of Xin Hongzhang.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually [Sudaluo]!" </p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang was instantly extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>According to the records of the secret technique, Sudaluo's strength ranked among the top hundred of all demons! He never expected to have such good luck!</p><p></p><p>Attempting to communicate with the projected demon before him through his divine senses, the murky and sticky sensation guided his divine senses into his mind.</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang was surprised, but soon, the feeling of being able to control Sudaluo left him relieved.</p><p></p><p>Manipulating Sudaluo to launch an attack, Xin Hongzhang could hardly contain his joy.</p><p></p><p>"This demon who has just been summoned is stronger than the three summoned by Fan Lida. If I were to impart [Manifestation of God] to other cultivators..."</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang was lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"The incompetent need not apply, the arrogant should step back, and those devoid of conscience should not..." </p><p></p><p>Recalling the selection criteria mentioned by Fan Lida, Xin Hongzhang began contemplating suitable candidates.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, hundreds of miles away, Li Fan, who could clearly observe Xin Hongzhang's expressions with the help of Sudaluo, revealed a satisfied smile.</p><p></p><p>The so-called myriad gods and demons were naturally the incarnations formed by Li Fan cultivating the [Three Calamities Hundred Tribulations Bright God Method].</p><p></p><p>The secret technique of manifesting gods was actually using the practitioner's body as a vessel to summon Li Fan's incarnations of thoughts and house them.</p><p></p><p>The seemingly effortless control was actually the incarnations reading the consciousness of the practitioner and acting of their own accord.</p><p></p><p>It was as if Li Fan had placed a part of his consciousness in the care of another cultivator.</p><p></p><p>By using their divine senses, nurturing and strengthening them, </p><p></p><p>Being a raw material for others while remaining unaware. That was the end result of practicing [Manifestation of God].</p><p></p><p>"My divine senses have surpassed those of the strong Master of Joining Dao. If I use this method, thousands of cultivators will become the beds for my divine thoughts to rest and grow..."</p><p></p><p>"And the beauty of it is, my incarnations of thoughts residing in the minds of these cultivators can subtly influence and change their thinking. Letting them be completely in my service."</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe..." Li Fan couldn't help but let out a dark and deep chuckle.</p><p></p><p>"If this widespread dissemination is sure to attract the attention of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"The signs are already so apparent that once Moru Bin knows about this, he will definitely see that this is the work of the former comrades of the Xuantian Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"All I need to do is sow a few more seeds."</p><p></p><p>With a flicker of his figure, Li Fan flew away from Jiushanzhou.</p><p></p><p>Next, he returned to various states of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance. Quietly enchanting a total of eighty cultivators to practice [Manifestation of God] then finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>Including the initial Xin Hongzhang, the first batch of practitioners totaled eighty-one.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? That kid moves quite swiftly, second-generation cultivators are already here." After sensing for a moment, Li Fan was very satisfied with Xin Hongzhang's efficiency.</p><p></p><p>"In no more than half a year, the numbers will be impressive."</p><p></p><p>"Getting closer, getting closer." Li Fan returned satisfied.</p><p></p><p>During the time he diligently sowed seeds, as Xin Hongzhang had said, the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance released an announcement on establishing the first free trade zone in Jiushanzhou.</p><p></p><p>This caused a stir in the world, as numerous aspiring cultivators and fortune-seekers flocked to Jiushanzhou.</p><p></p><p>Along with the announcement, there were many detailed rules.</p><p></p><p>Among them was a plan for the development of Jiushanzhou over the next hundred years, as well as regulations on resource and power distribution.</p><p></p><p>Most notably, one of the rules stated that ordinary cultivators were not eligible to purchase caves and plots of land in Jiushanzhou. Only those who made outstanding contributions to the development of Jiushanzhou would have this privilege. Moreover, to prevent the nobles from using underhanded means, all land transactions had to be announced through the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>If there were any collusion, any cultivator could report it.</p>

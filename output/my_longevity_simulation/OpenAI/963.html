            <p>He suddenly realized and said, "I understand!"</p><p></p><p>"The only ancient and new dual Tianzun of the Xuanhuang realm, such a person of utmost goodness and beauty..."</p><p></p><p>"Must also be an extremely intelligent figure!"</p><p></p><p>The voice of Yin Shangren grew louder and louder, "So, that's how it is..."</p><p></p><p>"Back then, after he successfully countered logic and suffered damage from the celestial flu, he did not fall on the spot. Instead, his power gradually declined."</p><p></p><p>"During this time, he had enough time to set up many backhands! All the doubts and puzzles may find answers from these backhands!"</p><p></p><p>"It must be like this!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, upon hearing this, felt a stir in his heart, "Mr. Bai's backhands?"</p><p></p><p>He recalled his experiences in the Celestial Realm, and every scene was related to Mr. Bai's past experiences. It was clear that this was a kind of guidance.</p><p></p><p>In the Celestial Realm, there should eventually be hidden the true goal that Mr. Bai wanted to convey.</p><p></p><p>Even...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought that when the 115th generation arrived, just based on the traces he left in the heavens and earth, it could achieve a certain level of resurrection.</p><p></p><p>Who knows if the real "Su Bai", thousands of years later today, will truly be reborn in some way?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan pondered, Yin Shangren in front of him became increasingly frantic.</p><p></p><p>"Yes! He is still waiting for me! I must go find him!"</p><p></p><p>Due to the crack in his body formed by the method of self-building through cultivation, it became increasingly apparent.</p><p></p><p>Another body hidden within Yin Shangren's body seemed restless, wanting to crawl out.</p><p></p><p>And by Li Fan's ear, a faint sound of drizzling rain could be heard.</p><p></p><p>Initially very faint, almost illusory.</p><p></p><p>But soon the rain became heavier and heavier, pouring down like a torrent, drenching the earth!</p><p></p><p>In this illusory downpour, the originally rocky floor of the laboratory also began to soften.</p><p></p><p>It even turned muddy.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained composed on the surface, but in reality, he was already floating in mid-air, slowly stepping back away from the muddy ground.</p><p></p><p>Escaping the muddy area.</p><p></p><p>Watching countless arms wriggling and reaching out from the ground, Li Fan's pupils slightly contracted.</p><p></p><p>And Yin Shangren's body also started twitching strangely.</p><p></p><p>His voice became intermittent and unclear.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, those pale arms, like fish swimming underwater, swiftly surged towards Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>Upon touching Yin Shangren's body, they forcibly plunged into his flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>"Puff..."</p><p></p><p>A sound like a bursting water bubble rang out clearly.</p><p></p><p>Then those thousands of pale arms continued swiftly surging towards Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Yin Shangren's body seemed to boil like water, continuously exhibiting bizarre convulsions.</p><p></p><p>Even the surrounding space began to distort slightly.</p><p></p><p>Watching this horrifying scene, Li Fan's expression turned serious.</p><p></p><p>Though he was already well-experienced and his strength could rival that of a Transcendent Being, the anomalies occurring in Yin Shangren's body, he had never seen such in all his reincarnation experiences throughout the years, nor had he even heard of them before.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes, and the strange scenes in front of him seemed to disappear in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Utterly calm, it was as if they never existed.</p><p></p><p>Even the noisy sounds around him disappeared along with it.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness also could not sense anything.</p><p></p><p>Opening his eyes again, the terrifying scene flooded back.</p><p></p><p>The boiling water became even fiercer, but the expression on Yin Shangren's face became even calmer.</p><p></p><p>As if a suddenly enlightened monk, all pain and confusion disappeared from him.</p><p></p><p>In this picture, the only thing that remained unchanged was the rib of Mr. Bai that Yin Shangren had hidden in his chest.</p><p></p><p>It was abrupt, yet it seemed like a lifeline.</p><p></p><p>Firmly connecting the increasingly ethereal Yin Shangren to the real world.</p><p></p><p>And throwing him towards the direction where Li Fan was.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took the rib, and the sound of rain in his ears intensified for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, as if reaching a critical point, all sounds disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In absolute silence, a light emerged from Yin Shangren's body.</p><p></p><p>Under the shining light, it was as if a rift in space had opened.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, trying to see clearly into the bright light.</p><p></p><p>But even with all his effort, he could only see vague figures floating in the air, with indistinct features and varying heights, aside from Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>They all seemed to be gazing at Yin Shangren, urging something.</p><p></p><p>The light became increasingly dazzling, eventually completely engulfing Li Fan's vision.</p><p></p><p>After the white light dimmed, Yin Shangren had completely vanished.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment, then proceeded to the underground chamber of Yin Yin Island. He found that the bodies that were originally placed there had also disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In this life, Yin Shangren did not choose self-immolation.</p><p></p><p>Because of Li Fan's words that drew his attention, Yin Shangren did not head towards the path of self-destruction.</p><p></p><p>Instead...</p><p></p><p>"Chose to return?"</p><p></p><p>The scene in the white light somehow made Li Fan think of this phrase.</p><p></p><p>"Revive me with rain..."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's body was full of oddities. The rain of countless bodies falling from the sky, Li Fan had once inquired about related records.</p><p></p><p>Except for Yin Shangren's side, there was no trace of any kind elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>"Not eerie, but full of eeriness."</p><p></p><p>"Just like how an ordinary Base-Building cultivator, without using the Chaotic spell, would find it difficult to kill. They might even be able to destroy with words..."</p><p></p><p>"Because he is akin to the shattered world's rules."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, following the records in the Heavenly Repair Chronicle, continued to analyze.</p><p></p><p>"For some reason, Yin Shangren still retained the imprint of the Xuanhuang realm before. The transformation was not complete, making him a being half-human and half-ghost. But just now, he completely threw himself into the embrace of the ghost world."</p><p></p><p>"Well...being an existence equivalent to the Xuanhuang Heavenly Dao indeed grants the ability to glimpse various mysteries."</p><p></p><p>No matter what bizarre actions Yin Shangren took, Li Fan was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, but these underhanded individuals are nothing to fear."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan coldly snorted, not giving the situation much thought.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that Li Fan was arrogant, but these ghosts were only real threats to the Xuanhuang realm when it was heavily damaged and on the brink of destruction.</p><p></p><p>Only at that point, when the Xuanhuang realm was weakened to an extreme, would the World Ghosts have a slight chance to turn the tables.</p><p></p><p>But then again, at that time, even if the World Ghosts somehow succeeded in victory and regained control of the Xuanhuang realm, the end awaiting them would only be continued destruction.</p><p></p><p>Essentially, the World Ghosts were like a virus that only erupts and occupies the body moments before death.</p><p></p><p>By the time they erupted, nothing really mattered.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity for Yin Shangren. His intelligence is high, even surpassing mine. I had hoped he would help me deduce the method of refining the Primordial Golden Elixir."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the island in front of him, Li Fan's eyes narrowed, destroying all the monsters Yin Shangren had cultivated in an instant.</p><p></p><p>In the underground chamber, Yin Shangren's collections were left saved in the Five Elements Sanctuary.</p><p></p><p>The only creature that survived on the island, apart from Li Fan, was the strange little dog with human hands for feet and eyes covering its belly.</p><p></p><p>This beast was quite sensitive, and the moment Li Fan harbored murderous intent, it immediately ran over and wagged its tail, seeking approval.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and spared the creature's life, absorbing it into the Five Elements Sanctuary.</p><p></p><p>Leaving Yin Yin Island, on the way back, Li Fan pondered over the gains from this encounter.</p><p></p><p>"As the only ancient and new dual Tianzun in the Xuanhuang realm, Mr. Bai's strength is undoubtedly beyond doubt."</p><p></p><p>"He might even be the reincarnation of the former Xuan Tian Wang..."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Emperor San Mao placed him in the central position of the Exhibition of Divine Treasures, and the eternal remnant left on his skull would have such great attraction."</p><p></p><p>"Eternal remnant surely includes the obsession from his lifetime. I wonder what Mr. Bai's obsession is?"</p><p></p><p>"It can't be to save the Xuanhuang realm, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but think so.</p><p></p><p>Now that he knew the true value of the skull, Li Fan had already begun to plan how to make Mr. Bai's skull his own.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I don't actually need to take Mr. Bai's skull. The goal is just the eternal remnant attached to it..."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I approach the skull, and let it absorb the remnant completely."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the entire process must not alert Emperor San Mao..."</p><p></p><p>"I'd better find a way to lure him out of the Exhibition of Divine Treasures..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking back and forth, he eventually returned to how to deal with Mo Rufin in a subtle manner.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Emperor San Mao should give the initiators some leeway."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan mildly sensed that the cultivators practicing the Heavenly Reigning Body had now reached a very impressive number.</p><p></p><p>They had become a major headache for the Union of Ten Thousand Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Presumably, Mo Rufin should have already known about this.</p><p></p><p>Through sensing the experiences of his followers, Li Fan discovered that there were indeed different forces within the investigative teams of the Union of Ten Thousand Immortals.</p><p></p><p>"It seems, it's time to actively make contact with them."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted his eyes, issuing commands through his mind to influence the thoughts of his followers.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Spiritwood Realm, Li Fan waited quietly for the situation to change.</p><p></p><p>During the wait, he took out the Heavenly Repair Chronicle to study again.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Repair Chronicle is truly profound."</p><p></p><p>"In the past, I would have had no way to discern Yin Shangren's origin. Even the entire Xuanhuang realm might not have had many cultivators who knew about the existence of World Ghosts."</p><p></p><p>This highlighted the importance of having a renowned teacher to guide one.</p><p></p><p>Rereading the Heavenly Repair Chronicle, Li Fan felt a different insight into his heart.</p><p></p><p>Truly, learning something new with each read.</p><p></p><p>---------------</p>

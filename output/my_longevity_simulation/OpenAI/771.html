        <h1>Chapter 771</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>On one side of the map, the information was very detailed. The names of the regions, the topography, everything was clear at a glance.</p><p></p><p>On the other curved side, however, it seemed shrouded in mist. Even the rough contours of the regions were hard to discern.</p><p></p><p>They were roughly divided into five areas.</p><p></p><p>"The area of the Five Elders Council is strictly controlled by the five immortal lords. It's really difficult to penetrate. Even though we are the World Alliance, we don't know much about it," Xu Bai said, marking thousands of black dots on the map in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Most of them were distributed within the territory of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance, with only a few located in the mist.</p><p></p><p>"These are the small worlds that have already been excluded, most of them still undiscovered by the cultivators of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance. But some have been exposed," Xu Bai pointed out, marking thirty-seven black dots with a small "Immortal" flag.</p><p></p><p>"And there are some that the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance has explored and confirmed, but haven't ventured into in recent years," he added, sending four hundred and thirty-five Immortal flags flying to different corners of the map.</p><p></p><p>"The whereabouts of Xu Ke should be in one of the remaining small worlds of the Xuanhuang Realm," Xu Bai said solemnly, standing in front of the map.</p><p></p><p>"I hope you can find Xu Ke successfully before traversing all the remaining small worlds within the territory of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, if by any chance he is in a small world whose entrance is within the area of the Five Elders Council, there will be little hope left."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xiaohong couldn't help but ask, "Aren't you supposed to be the World Alliance? Can't you provide us with the information about the entrances to the small worlds you know of?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I'm some big shot in the World Alliance?" Xu Bai countered.</p><p></p><p>"For the sake of ensuring the safety of each small world, within our alliance, only designated envoys are responsible for contacting specific small worlds. Apart from their designated areas, the envoys are unaware of the situations in other small worlds," Xu Bai explained.</p><p></p><p>"If you are capable, perhaps you could interrogate the Elder Liu of the Hedaogang captured last time with severe methods, maybe you'll get some information out of him," Xu Hong fell silent immediately.</p><p></p><p>The Empress looked at the map of the Xuanhuang Realm before her, feeling a sense of powerlessness rising within her.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze also became less resolute, "This... it's almost like finding a needle in a haystack."</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter? Are you having doubts already?" Xu Bai was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"What Xiaohhei can do, I can do the same. Xu Dao friends, rest assured, the Empire will never go back on its word," Xiaohqing, who had been hesitant before, suddenly became firm.</p><p></p><p>At Xiaohqing's signal, the Empress eventually handed over the improved "Sacred Blood Birth Transformation Method" to Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Not recorded by books or jade slips.</p><p></p><p>But recorded by the unique beast of the Empire, the "Bookworm."</p><p></p><p>"To practice the Sacred Blood Birth Transformation Method, you need certain specific resources. Xu Dao friend, please wait a moment, we'll have someone prepare them for you," Xiaohqing continued.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Without directly checking the contents recorded in the "Bookworm," Xu Bai temporarily put it away, then pondered for a moment before suggesting, "The most important thing for you now is to race against the cultivators of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Besides being able to quickly and conveniently detect the entrances to the small worlds with the help of the Tianxuan Treasure Mirror, you may also approximate Xu Ke's whereabouts through divination."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if Xu Ke left behind any personal belongings back then? I might ask the seniors in the organization to help you deduce something."</p><p></p><p>"After all, I am really curious about my ancestor," Xu Bai smiled.</p><p></p><p>There were several lawbreakers of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance within the Empire.</p><p></p><p>If combined with the "Ultimate Circular Disc" given by Xu Bai, they could search for the entrances to the small worlds without revealing their identities.</p><p></p><p>After hearing Xu Bai's words, Xiaohqing and Xiaohong looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Xiaohqing said, "When the master left, he did leave behind some personal items. We have kept them safe."</p><p></p><p>"Come then."</p><p></p><p>With Xiaohqing's lead, Xu Bai arrived at the top of the high tower palace, entering a small unremarkable room.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the luxurious room they met in earlier, the interior was very plain.</p><p></p><p>It did not resemble the residence of the founders of the Empire.</p><p></p><p>"This was where the master lived back then, and everything inside remains untouched. At first, we had hoped that the master might return. But after all these years, we have understood that it was an impossible hope," Xiaohong's tone was somewhat melancholic.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Bai scanned the room, his heart suddenly shook.</p><p></p><p>Because in one of the drawers of a wooden table, he found a thin red string!</p><p></p><p>Only a few strands, as if they could break at any moment.</p><p></p><p>But both in appearance and in the faint aura it retained, Xu Bai was extremely familiar with it!</p><p></p><p>"Is this the red string that Mr. Bai left for Xu Ke?"</p><p></p><p>"He didn't take it with him when he left?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>Without leaving a trace, he shifted his gaze as if looking at other items in the room.</p><p></p><p>"It's correct, that's the red string that Xu Ke had, capable of easily slaying the Red Nine-Headed. But it seems like it's not the original, rather a strand pulled out separately by Xu Ke."</p><p></p><p>"Was it left as a final means of protection for the Empire?"</p><p></p><p>"But seeing how it's been left here gathering dust, it seems Xiaohqing and Xiaohong are unaware of how terrifying this Red String can be."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's mind instantly spun, feeling a somewhat uncontrollable excitement.</p><p></p><p>He was all too aware of the terrifying power contained in this red string.</p><p></p><p>Even if only a strand remained now, it was likely enough to pose a lethal threat to a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Xu Bai subconsciously thought of making it his own.</p><p></p><p>"The method of divination is profound and elusive. It's best to collect a few more."</p><p></p><p>He explained.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, they are all just worldly things. Take as many as you need to increase the chance of finding the master as much as possible," Xiaohqing said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai then took out a pen, a piece of clothing once worn by Xu Ke, and after pretending to search around, finally took the red string.</p><p></p><p>"Is it that simple?"</p><p></p><p>As he held the treasure in his hand, Xu Bai found it somewhat unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>However, after discussing the details again with Xiaohqing and the others, he bid farewell and left.</p><p></p><p>Finally out of the Empire, he confirmed that he had effortlessly obtained Mr. Bai's red string.</p><p></p><p>"I still need to study its specific usage."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai didn't dare linger longer, riding swiftly all the way back to the Xuanhuang Realm.</p>

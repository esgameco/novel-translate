            <p>This matter is still related to Li Fan. </p><p></p><p>Originally, these two individuals were proud and unwilling to join the Wansian Alliance for the sake of cultivation techniques. They preferred risking their lives to explore ancient sect ruins and search for ancient cultivation techniques, rather than selling themselves to the Wansian Alliance or Wulao Club for others.</p><p></p><p>But in this life, their attitude changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>The cause was that after Tianyang He Dao was successful, Li Fan ordered them to detonate the Void in Qilingzhou.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the immortal poison that had been sealed within was released and began to wreak havoc in the world.</p><p></p><p>All cultivators were unable to escape the fate of being infected by the immortal poison.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi were no exception.</p><p></p><p>At that time, they were only at the Foundation Building stage and were not of any special physique. After being infected, their symptoms rapidly worsened.</p><p></p><p>In just a few days, they were left with only a breath.</p><p></p><p>Just when the two brothers were preparing to go to the yellow springs...</p><p></p><p>They unexpectedly received the Wansian Alliance's free special medicine!</p><p></p><p>The two individuals, who had deep prejudices against the Wansian Alliance, did not hesitate in the face of life and death.</p><p></p><p>They hastily swallowed the medicine.</p><p></p><p>The effect was immediate, and within a few days, they had already shown improvement.</p><p></p><p>When the second dose of the special medicine from the Wansian Alliance was distributed, the two of them completely survived this ordeal.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi, who had come back to life, owed a great debt to the Wansian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>After reflecting deeply, they reevaluated their previous prejudices against the Wansian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, they both joined the Wansian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps surviving a great disaster would bring great fortune.</p><p></p><p>After joining the Wansian Alliance, these two brothers sold all the miscellaneous items they had obtained from their adventures throughout their cultivation to Tianxuan Mirror. As a result, they received a substantial sum of money.</p><p></p><p>Directly exchanging for two High-Grade Cultivation Techniques even with surpluses.</p><p></p><p>With their accumulated wealth, within a short period, they broke through the Foundation Building stage and became cultivators in the Golden Core realm.</p><p></p><p>"Such a strange fate has led us here."</p><p></p><p>On the Hai Xuan Island, after seeing these unexpectedly survivors, Ji Shao Li dedicated some contribution points to clarify the events surrounding them.</p><p></p><p>And after a dispute arose between them and members of the mutual aid society, he stepped in to stop them. </p><p></p><p>"Although these two individuals are straightforward, their determination in sticking to their decisions, once they make them, is also advantageous in some aspects," Ji Shao Li thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Facing Dao Xuanzi's determination to leave, Ji Shao Li did not show anger but instead asked him a soul-searching question.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you two angry? Did those few just now really say something wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Dao Xuanzi hesitated slightly.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shao Li solemnly said, "If they said something wrong, I will make them apologize to you immediately."</p><p></p><p>"However, others have also mentioned the same things they said. Although I am reluctant to believe it, rumors usually have some basis. The Alliance has always been vague about how to ultimately win, contrary to reason..."</p><p></p><p>"Can we blame others for this?"</p><p></p><p>"Or is it that you, two fellow Daoists, have personally witnessed the front line battles and are sure our words are wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shao Li's words astonished Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi.</p><p></p><p>They opened their mouths to speak but couldn't find the words to refute him.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shao Li smiled faintly and said, "Please, both of you, have a seat. Our mutual aid society has grown considerable, and clashes of ideas are bound to happen with more people."</p><p></p><p>"So, 'seeking similarities while respecting differences' is one of our basic principles."</p><p></p><p>"Everyone can have their own thoughts. If you think someone is wrong, present facts, speak with reason, and refute them."</p><p></p><p>"To resort to quarreling after a simple disagreement, how can that be considered gentlemanly behavior?" Ji Shao Li extended his hand, pressing the two struggling individuals back into their seats.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi glanced at each other, feeling a mix of shock and agreement with Ji Shao Li's words.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, they first apologized to the small group they had clashed with before and then sat down, carefully observing Ji Shao Li.</p><p></p><p>They had heard of the head of the Congyun Mutual Aid Society before.</p><p></p><p>They had heard rumors that he was mysterious and possibly had a remarkable background, but they never expected his strength to be so unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>"My brother, he seems to be at the Golden Core cultivation level as well. How could he render us defenseless?" Dao Xuanzi sent a message.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong narrowed his eyes, "He must have hidden his cultivation level. If we face him one-on-one, we might not be a match for those exceptional geniuses. However, together, we should be no weaker than any individual at the same level!"</p><p></p><p>Dao Xuanzi also nodded, feeling somewhat relieved, "It seems that way. So, he must possess Nascent Soul cultivation? It appears that this mutual aid society is truly extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>This included but was not limited to the achievements of the Congyun Mutual Aid Society within a few years, outstanding members, their backgrounds, and future plans for the society.</p><p></p><p>Although these were not substantial contents, merely encouragements, Ji Shao Li's persuasiveness combined with his captivating tone incited great excitement.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators present blushed, as if they had already seen the wonderful future awaiting them after joining the mutual aid society.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi, too, were deeply drawn to the benefits described by Ji Shao Li, instantly forgetting the recent unpleasant friction.</p><p></p><p>"It seems we have come to the right place after all."</p><p></p><p>They exchanged glances, both thinking the same.</p><p></p><p>After the sermon, under the witness of the 'Compassionate True Immortal of the Red Dust', they officially became members of the mutual aid society.</p><p></p><p>Another round of fervent celebration ensued.</p><p></p><p>When the crowd dispersed, they finally came back to reality.</p><p></p><p>"Was that a bit hasty?"</p><p></p><p>Before they could deeply ponder this, Ji Shao Li discreetly led them to a hidden chamber on the island.</p><p></p><p>"Ji Daoist, what is this aboutâ€¦" Kou Hong's vigilance rose.</p><p></p><p>However, Ji Shao Li's face showed a sincere expression as he said, "Actually, what you both said struck a chord in my heart earlier. But in order to appease public anger, I had to resort to some clever argumentation."</p><p></p><p>"In today's world, earnest cultivators like you two, full of passion and sincerity, are not easy to come by."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shao Li bowed to the two, expressing his apology.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi were taken aback by this move and hurriedly returned the gesture.</p><p></p><p>"However, your passionate hearts are directed towards the wrong entity!" At this moment, Ji Shao Li's expression changed, and he said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The sudden change in Ji Shao Li's attitude completely threw the two off balance.</p><p></p><p>"Ji Daoist, what do you mean..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shao Li said, "Hehe, I know that you joined the Wansian Alliance because of the life-saving grace of the special medicine."</p><p></p><p>"But well, what exactly is this so-called 'special medicine'..."</p><p></p><p>"Have a look for yourselves!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Ji Shao Li tossed a jade slip to them.</p><p></p><p>Inside, detailed information about the Heart Ascension Pill was carved!</p><p></p><p>"Million... Immortal... Alliance..."</p>

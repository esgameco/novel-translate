            <p>At the same time, he suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Peituo acted so strangely just now. It turned out that what Jishao promised was actually an ownerless Primordial Infant's Cave Heaven!</p><p></p><p>You must know that as a Golden Core cultivator, if you want to advance to the Primordial Infant realm, you must possess a Cave Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Each ownerless Cave Heaven practically represents a Primordial Infant cultivator about to rise.</p><p></p><p>Its value is immeasurable.</p><p></p><p>Apart from joining prominent sects and families, one must rely entirely on luck to find one.</p><p></p><p>It's difficult, very difficult!</p><p></p><p>Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance has countless Foundation Establishment and Golden Core cultivators, like crops being replaced season after season.</p><p></p><p>But Primordial Infant cultivators can already be considered elite, holding important positions in various states.</p><p></p><p>They are the backbone of the Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The difference in realms is like heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Jishao Li himself is only at the Golden Core realm. Is he really providing information on ownerless Cave Heavens to members of the mutual aid association?</p><p></p><p>Is that possible?</p><p></p><p>The people present couldn’t help but feel a bit doubtful.</p><p></p><p>It's not that they are distrustful.</p><p></p><p>It's just that...</p><p></p><p>This matter seems a bit unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that Jishao Li is just a lone individual with no powerful backing.</p><p></p><p>Even if he is a member of some mysterious organization.</p><p></p><p>With an ownerless Cave Heaven in hand, there would be countless people willing to join him. Why bother recruiting soldiers and buying horses in this sea of clouds?</p><p></p><p>Could it be the Elder Council?</p><p></p><p>At this thought, the people who had calmed down from their initial excitement couldn't help but be shocked. The more they thought about it, the more uneasy they felt.</p><p></p><p>And Jishao Li naturally understood what these people were thinking.</p><p></p><p>He smiled knowingly, "You don't need to worry. I am definitely not a spy from the Elder Council for Peituo."</p><p></p><p>"The ownerless Cave Heavens prepared for Peituo are also within the territory of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance."</p><p></p><p>The people finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"As the [Mutual Aid Association] is newly established, it's normal for you to have doubts. However, facts speak louder than words. When Peituo achieves the Primordial Infant realm, all doubts will be dispelled." Jishao Li said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"However, before completing this matter, let's resolve your issues first."</p><p></p><p>Jishao Li clapped his hands lightly, and after a moment, an image of a faceless stone statue appeared in the hall at the cave party.</p><p></p><p>"This is the true immortal of [Relief and Compassion for the World, Red Dust Mercy]. You only need to sincerely pray to it, silently recite the oath of joining, and the induction ceremony will be completed."</p><p></p><p>"Afterward, I will transfer contribution points to each of you," Jishao Li introduced with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"So simple?" Xiangxin was a little skeptical.</p><p></p><p>"It is that simple. Our mutual aid association does not involve any mysteries," Jishao Li affirmed.</p><p></p><p>At his words, everyone couldn’t help but look up at the faceless stone statue in the air.</p><p></p><p>There didn’t seem to be anything extraordinary, only a faint inexplicable aura emanating from it, narrating the extraordinary nature of the statue.</p><p></p><p>With the temptation of ownerless Cave Heavens, Peituo naturally had no fear and was the first to step forward and silently recite in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After a while.</p><p></p><p>He lifted his head, "Is that it?"</p><p></p><p>It seemed like nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>"That's it. Welcome to officially join the [Mutual Aid Association]," Jishao Li showed a warm smile.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the others also followed suit.</p><p></p><p>In no time, the first batch of six cultivators of the mutual aid association had completed their induction.</p><p></p><p>True to his word, Jishao Li immediately transferred 100,000 contribution points to each of them.</p><p></p><p>When they confirmed that they had received this large amount of contribution through the Heavenly Essence Mirror on the island.</p><p></p><p>They all seemed a bit dazed, as if in a dream.</p><p></p><p>"Members of the mutual aid association, quality over quantity. So please refrain from spreading the word. Of course, if you have outstanding friends or relatives, you can actively introduce them to join."</p><p></p><p>After they left, Jishao Li turned around and looked at the somewhat impatient Peituo.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what foundation-building miraculous objects and Golden Core techniques Brother Pei possesses, and what Primordial Infant cultivation techniques you're preparing for," Jishao Li suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>Peituo hesitated for a moment before answering.</p><p></p><p>"I have achieved the Dao Foundation with [Sturdy Rock Wall], and the Shield, Vitality, and Earth techniques have achieved the Golden Core."</p><p></p><p>"I have set my sights on a cultivation technique called 'Eight Directions Unmoving Earth-Sealing Technique.'"</p><p></p><p>Jishao Li praised, "The mutual confirmation of foundation-building miraculous objects and Golden Core techniques means that Brother Pei is truly extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for a reply, he continued, "I happen to know of a place called [Thousand Rock Cave Heaven], which suits your path very well."</p><p></p><p>"What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>"Thousand Rock Cave Heaven? That would be excellent," Peituo replied with great joy upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>But then, he suddenly realized something and froze.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Jishao Li not far away, and the shock in his heart was indescribable.</p><p></p><p>The fact that he had advanced all the way to the Golden Core completion solely by his own efforts meant that Peituo was definitely not an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>He keenly sensed that something was not right.</p><p></p><p>To happen to come across the [Thousand Rock Cave Heaven] that perfectly matched his path...</p><p></p><p>How could everything align so perfectly!</p><p></p><p>Considering that the opportunity to find a Cave Heaven that matched his foundation-building and Golden Core techniques was rare for most Primordial Infant cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It was lucky enough to find a Cave Heaven that could help achieve Primordial Infant cultivation. Who could be so selective?</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, what Jishao Li had prepared for him was almost tailor-made...</p><p></p><p>Either it was a coincidence or...</p><p></p><p>Jishao Li knew about not just one, but many different Cave Heavens.</p><p></p><p>After learning about his cultivation path, he immediately selected the most suitable one.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps only the top few forces of the Immortals Alliance could do this.</p><p></p><p>A chill ran down Peituo's spine.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the image of the [faceless stone statue] appeared once again.</p><p></p><p>The true immortal of [Relief and Compassion for the World, Red Dust Mercy].</p><p></p><p>What exactly...</p><p></p><p>Just as Peituo felt uneasy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Jishao Li spoke again, "Brother Pei, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>"If you have no objections, then let's set off."</p><p></p><p>Of course, Peituo immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>Next, the two of them used the teleportation array to arrive at the Ten Thousand Immortals Island and then set off towards the heartland of the Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>This slightly alleviated Peituo's worries.</p><p></p><p>"At least it definitely isn't related to the Elder Council," he thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Upon arriving in Gufengzhou and leaving the Floating Sky City.</p><p></p><p>Jishao Li cast a secret technique to conceal their whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>Then, they hurried along the way and arrived at a barren desert.</p><p></p><p>After surveying the surroundings and ensuring that there were no other cultivators nearby.</p><p></p><p>Jishao Li pointed upwards and whispered, "The Thousand Rock Cave Heaven is right here."</p><p></p><p>Peituo was slightly taken aback, then flew to the location indicated by Jishao Li and carefully sensed it.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he indeed sensed the presence of an ownerless Cave Heaven, and he couldn't contain his excitement.</p><p></p><p>But at the same time, he couldn't hide the shock in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Ascend here."</p><p></p><p>"I will guard you," Jishao Li said.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 944</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan showed no signs of nervousness and politely said, "Senior brothers, please be patient. Let me confirm this matter thoroughly."</p><p></p><p>"However, I need to separate a strand of divine consciousness to go there!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Li Fan pointed his index finger towards the sleeping Yanfa Xiaoluoli lying on the long table.</p><p></p><p>The four Daoist masters exchanged glances, all looking troubled.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan simply waited quietly for their decision.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, is there no other way?" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan calmly responded, "One must tailor the remedy to the disease. If the cause is misdiagnosed and a rescue is attempted forcibly, it might lead to even greater damage."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a slight strand of divine consciousness, used only for observation and communication. It's unlikely to harm even an ordinary person..."</p><p></p><p>"If you are still unsure, then forget it."</p><p></p><p>After some discussion, the four Daoist masters ultimately decided to let Li Fan try.</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan separated a strand of divine consciousness, he immediately felt four different divine consciousnesses latching onto him like chains.</p><p></p><p>The five of them connected as a whole.</p><p></p><p>Everything they saw and heard could be shared, and they could communicate with each other.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>The voices of the four sounded in Li Fan's mind simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Understanding that this was a necessary precaution, Li Fan had no objections.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the five strands of divine consciousness flew into Yanfa Xiaoluoli's subconscious mind together.</p><p></p><p>It was a world filled with shimmering golden light, with numerous martial arts techniques floating around like books in a vast and boundless ocean.</p><p></p><p>As the divine consciousness entered, it almost lost its direction.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could clearly see the names of the martial arts techniques floating around him, and if possible, he could even browse through their contents.</p><p></p><p>If not for the four powerful divine consciousnesses vigilantly watching, he would have been eager to explore the countless martial arts techniques.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the desire to peek at those techniques, Li Fan materialized his consciousness into a form and shouted to the surroundings, "Hey kiddo, stop pretending to sleep! Come out!"</p><p></p><p>Though his voice was not loud, in this world full of martial arts techniques, it was completely out of the ordinary.</p><p></p><p>He steadfastly spread his voice around.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the divine consciousness of the four Daoist masters also manifested in various forms.</p><p></p><p>"What did you say? Yanfa Jue is pretending to sleep?"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>They had never considered this possibility, looking incredulous as they stared at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring them, Li Fan continued to call out, "Hey kiddo, do you think pretending to sleep would reduce your workload? What belongs to you will always be yours! You can't escape it!"</p><p></p><p>"When you wake up, won't you have to continue deducing? Even make up for the time you lost…"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was urging like a ruthless boss to his subordinate, incessantly nagging. </p><p></p><p>Even the four Daoist masters couldn't help but furrow their brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>And so it went on for who knew how long.</p><p></p><p>"Stop making noise!"</p><p></p><p>A petite figure suddenly appeared above Li Fan's head.</p><p></p><p>Holding a wooden stick several times larger than herself, she aimed to strike Li Fan on the head.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou..."</p><p></p><p>"You're awake!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the four Daoist masters were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan was not strong in actual combat, he wouldn't have missed such an obvious attack.</p><p></p><p>With a swift movement, he evaded Yanfa Xiaoluoli's attack.</p><p></p><p>Swinging the stick in empty air, Xiaoluoli shouldered the stick and huffily approached Li Fan, "What kiddo? Grandma here is thousands of years old! I'm many times older than you!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression darkened as he scolded, "If that's the case, why maintain a childlike appearance and insist on pretending to sleep?"</p><p></p><p>"Numerous people were worried about you!"</p><p></p><p>Yanfa Xiaoluoli trembled, her momentum suddenly weakened.</p><p></p><p>But then she coldly snorted, pretending to be tough, "It's none of your business! You're really annoying! If it weren't for you, they wouldn't have figured it out!"</p><p></p><p>Observing Li Fan, her eyes flashed with hostility.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan turned to the four Daoist masters and politely gestured.</p><p></p><p>Everything was understood without the need for words.</p><p></p><p>"My ancestor, why are you throwing a tantrum again..."</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man approached Yanfa Xiaoluoli at this moment, looking helpless.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know, in just these few days, the Hall of Protection has been almost paralyzed. Many urgent matters had to be postponed forcefully..."</p><p></p><p>"What's that got to do with me?" The stick on her shoulder vanished, and Xiaoluoli covered her ears, as if not listening.</p><p></p><p>"I've been working continuously for two thousand three hundred and twenty-seven days! It's been tough! I was already promised a break before, and then suddenly it was taken away!" She stated grumpily.</p><p></p><p>"I don't care! I still want a holiday!"</p><p></p><p>Never did they expect that it was due to this reason, that Yanfa Jue had pretended to sleep.</p><p></p><p>The four Daoist masters could only smile helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"That's unreasonable…"</p><p></p><p>The four of them comforted and admonished one another, wasting quite some time before finally persuading Yanfa Xiaoluoli to change her mind.</p><p></p><p>She agreed to rest for another day before resuming work.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, Yanfa Xiaoluoli disappeared in a huff, and the group was forcefully expelled from her subconscious mind.</p><p></p><p>Returning to their own bodies, they looked at the distant light ball whose changing speed had normalized, and couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"How did you figure out that Yanfa Jue was pretending to sleep, young brother?" The white-haired old man asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>His attitude had softened, no longer as indifferent as before.</p><p></p><p>"It's a unique technique that I cannot disclose," Li Fan refused to answer the question without showing awe towards the Daoist masters treating him as a peer.</p><p></p><p>A hint of embarrassment flashed across the white-haired old man's face.</p><p></p><p>However, it quickly disappeared without causing a scene.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, this young cultivator who could see through Yanfa Jue's "illness" at a glance must have remarkable medical skills.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was not a Daoist master, his talent was exceptional.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it's fine. As long as Yanfa Jue wakes up," the other three Daoist masters jovially defused the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, since I helped you solve this difficult problem, there should be some reward, right?" Li Fan suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>The four men were momentarily surprised.</p><p></p><p>It was the white-haired old man who responded quickly, "Of course! There will be a reward!"</p><p></p><p>"The reward is negotiable. However, regarding the issue of Yanfa Jue's malfunction, we also need your help to maintain secrecy."</p><p></p><p>"What would you like as a reward?"</p><p></p><p>After contemplating for a moment, Li Fan replied, "I haven't decided yet. If I have any needs in the future, I'll come to you. Is that acceptable?"</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man stared at Li Fan for a moment, then handed him a jade pendant, symbolizing his identity.</p><p></p><p>With everything back on track, Li Fan returned to the waiting space.</p>

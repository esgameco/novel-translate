            <p>"Furthermore, we all have a common demand. That is, the fewer the monks who know the secret of this fishing pond, the better. Zhu Daoyou, do you think you can keep this secret based solely on your strength?"</p><p></p><p>"I was able to discover the anomalies here today. Someday, other monks will also be able to discover them. Can you stop them?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli stared at Zhong Shentong closely and asked without reservation.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong could only remain silent.</p><p></p><p>"But with our help, the risk of being discovered by other monks can be greatly reduced. It might even be possible to forever possess this treasure!" Ji Shaoli said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Us?" Zhong Shentong's expression finally changed.</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a long time, he reluctantly put away the purple-gold gourd in his hand and said somewhat helplessly, "Friend, speak your mind."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the feeling of crisis that had been lingering in Ji Shaoli's heart completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Zhong, this purple-gold gourd, was it also fished out from the fishing pond?" Ji Shaoli's eyes flickered as he asked.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not approach.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong smiled faintly, "I have guarded this fishing platform for most of my life, and only fished out this treasure."</p><p></p><p>"The Chaos Purple-Golden Gourd, with purple quality. I wonder which realm's artifact it is, containing the Chaos Dual Qi. In the blink of an eye, it can transform the Chaos Dual Qi into flying knives to fight enemies. It is said that even Nascent Soul cultivators can instantly slay foes. But it's a pity..."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong shook his head slightly, "That's only in other realms. In our Primordial Yellow Realm, cultivators above the Yuan Infant stage merge with Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth are eternal, and cultivators are immortal. So the Chaos Purple-Golden Gourd isn't as powerful here."</p><p></p><p>These words explained why he hesitated to take action easily.</p><p></p><p>Under the influence of many protective treasures, Ji Shaoli's aura already surpassed the realm of Golden Core cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong couldn't accurately assess his true cultivation level and didn't have confidence in landing a fatal blow.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, hearing that there might be an organization behind Ji Shaoli, he had no choice but to give up.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Zhong, how many years have you discovered the mysteries of this fishing pond?" Ji Shaoli finally descended from the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong's eyes flashed with a hint of recollection, "I can't remember clearly either. It was when I was young, time passes by so quickly..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli calmly assessed the Daoist Liuli who had been protected by Zhong Shentong all along.</p><p></p><p>Looking like a porcelain doll, with exquisite features.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a loose Daoist robe, at a glance, one couldn't tell the gender.</p><p></p><p>Liuli stuck out a head at this moment, not showing much fear in the eyes.</p><p></p><p>Just glaring fiercely at Ji Shaoli with puffed-up cheeks.</p><p></p><p>"This little kid..."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong chuckled, "Just an adopted ordinary orphan..."</p><p></p><p>Just then, Liuli widened her eyes, looking shocked, and raised her head to Zhong Shentong, "Master, didn't you say I was also fished out from this pond..."</p><p></p><p>"Wu..." Before the words were finished, Zhong Shentong hastily covered her mouth regretfully.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha." Ji Shaoli laughed heartily towards the sky, but then suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Staring coldly at Zhong Shentong, he said with a fierce expression, "If you insist on this, don't blame me for being merciless."</p><p></p><p>"Lin Ling!"</p><p></p><p>Liuli also knew she had made a mistake and stopped struggling immediately.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong, however, did not blame her. Just patting the little Daoist's head, he continuously comforted the tearful Liuli.</p><p></p><p>Both sides confronted each other for some time.</p><p></p><p>As a figure appeared in the sky, the oppressive aura of Harmonious Dao descended.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong's face turned pale, sighing deeply, and finally gave in.</p><p></p><p>"Little Liuli, indeed, I fell out of the fishing pond."</p><p></p><p>"At the beginning, it was just a transparent fruit similar to Liuli. I was about to eat her when I faintly heard a baby's cry..."</p><p></p><p>Abandoning his resistance, Zhong Shentong sat on the ground and slowly recounted.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling was very curious about this pretty little Daoist and continued to scan the other party with his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>And this little girl seemed to sense it and stared back at Lin Ling without showing weakness.</p><p></p><p>The two stared at each other, neither backing down.</p><p></p><p>This scene made Zhong Shentong suddenly amused, and his uneasiness disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the overwhelming power of the Harmonious Dao displayed by the opponent, he felt desperate.</p><p></p><p>However, from the actions of this Harmonious Dao Venerable, the situation seemed not as bad as he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ji Shaoli also walked to the side of the fishing pond.</p><p></p><p>Facing away from Zhong Shentong, he slowly said, "I am not a murderer. Unless absolutely necessary, I do not wish to unjustly cause harm. However, the secret of the fishing pond must never be revealed."</p><p></p><p>"One is to sacrifice oneself. If you agree to this, I promise you that this little kid will have a carefree life in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Secondly..."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong squinted as he listened to Ji Shaoli's words pause intentionally.</p><p></p><p>"That is to join our Multiverse Alliance. As long as we are one family, there will be no need to worry about secrets being leaked."</p><p></p><p>"Multiverse... Alliance?" Hearing this unfamiliar name, Zhong Shentong was momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>But with a Harmonious Dao cultivator presiding, it was definitely not simple.</p><p></p><p>Without any choice, Zhong Shentong quickly agreed.</p><p></p><p>"I am willing to join you."</p><p></p><p>"Good! Friend Zhong, you really know the current situation!" Ji Shaoli applauded and praised.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Ling!" He called out again.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling looked at Ji Shaoli, then gently pointed towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, an image of a faceless stone statue appeared above Zhong Shentong.</p><p></p><p>Although the features of the statue were not clear, Zhong Shentong suddenly felt a chilling sensation.</p><p></p><p>Having faced the countless orbs of light in the fishing pond day after day, he had developed an almost intuitive appraisal ability for the grade of items.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong almost immediately realized that this stone statue was definitely extraordinary!</p><p></p><p>As he had expected, he heard Ji Shaoli respectfully say, "This is the likeness of the Compassionate True Immortal of the Mortal Dust. Any new member must recite an oath in front of the statue."</p><p></p><p>Speaking, a more than two hundred-word oath was transmitted to Zhong Shentong's mind.</p><p></p><p>"True Immortal..." Zhong Shentong felt a chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that behind this Multiverse Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong dared not dwell on it.</p><p></p><p>Having seen items from different realms in the fishing platform, he was convinced of the existence of the Immortal Realm superior to all cultivation realms.</p><p></p><p>With a solemn expression, Zhong Shentong recited the membership oath in front of everyone.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 917</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Inside, there were no mountains, rivers, or lakes, only an environment extremely similar to the sword mound.</p><p></p><p>Countless swords inserted into the ground in a disorderly manner everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The sword energy circulated all around, forming gusts of fierce winds.</p><p></p><p>The entire cave world belonged entirely to swords. It didn't tolerate any other living creatures.</p><p></p><p>Inside the sword mound, outside the sword's cave world, the clone of Li Qing, which had already turned to dust and bones, slowly reappeared with a slight movement of flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>"Early Yuan Infant stage," he sensed his own cultivation and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>His realm was slightly weaker than his original self. Although his actual combat strength was still unmatched, building a foundation with the wonders of the heavens would surely overpower ordinary God-Transforming cultivators.</p><p></p><p>However, after entering the Yuan Infant realm, Li Qing felt a resisting force hindering his progress.</p><p></p><p>When the clone bid farewell to the Sword Monarch Mu Jian, returning to the Yellow Springs Realm.</p><p></p><p>The hidden malice became more apparent.</p><p></p><p>A phrase involuntarily appeared in Li Qing's mind.</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Being's new law is going against the heavens. The more blessings from heaven and earth one receives, the harder it will be to go against the principles of heaven and earth in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Even when sacrificing the souls of heaven and earth, one will face the backlash of the will of heaven and earth multiplied. Even with high talent, most will basically halt at the God-Transforming stage."</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the birth of this black sword also had something to do with Li Qing. When he devoured it and turned it into a cave world, he did not sense much resistance. However, he had a premonition that this was the limit that heaven and earth could tolerate.</p><p></p><p>When he wanted to go further, to ascend to the God-Transforming stage, and even reach the Unity Realm, he would need to face the complete malice of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Nonetheless, Li Qing did not care much about it.</p><p></p><p>After all, as a clone, his mission was not cultivation, but to go to the meeting of the Five Elders, and to the place of the One-Hearted Heavenly Venerable, to retrieve the lost cultivation method of the Mysterious Heaven Sect.</p><p></p><p>After checking the information sent by his original self, due to the inexplicable spatial fluctuations earlier, the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders were currently in a rare ceasefire period.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing slightly discerned the direction and transformed into a black stream of light, quickly speeding towards the destination.</p><p></p><p>As he flew, Li Qing instantly felt something different from before.</p><p></p><p>When his original self traveled through the air, he needed to overcome the resistance between heaven and earth, as well as the rushing gusts of wind.</p><p></p><p>But as Li Qing transformed into a sword light, he perfectly integrated with the surrounding environment like a fish in water.</p><p></p><p>Not only was the resistance almost negligible, but the consumption of flying was also remarkably low!</p><p></p><p>"The wonders of the heavens naturally belong to the Xuanyellow Way. Hence, they are privileged."</p><p></p><p>Flying was no longer a tiresome task but had become a kind of enjoyment.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing felt extremely relieved in his heart. If not for fear of attracting the attention of the Wanxian Alliance, he would have let out a long howl of relief.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the black sword light grew faster, flashing across the sky.</p><p></p><p>Even if someone caught a glimpse by chance, they would only think it was their own illusion.</p><p></p><p>But seven days later, the Jiozhou of the Five Elders was already faintly visible.</p><p></p><p>In front of the vast mist barrier covering the sky and earth, a group of martial practitioners from the Wanxian Alliance's Martial Hall was stationed.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing did not alert them. Relying on the information sent by his original self, he easily bypassed the monitoring of the Alliance's defensive formation and entered the mist barrier.</p><p></p><p>As a buffer zone between the Five Elders and the Wanxian Alliance, the Jiozhou had not been touched by any Venerate except the Blissful Traveller.</p><p></p><p>The reason for choosing this place to enter the Five Elders was that it could bypass the "Land of Truth" and, after crossing the realm of mortals, reach the Pure-Hearted Immortal Sect directly.</p><p></p><p>In the Land of Truth, all lies were exposed. Obviously, it was not a suitable place to lurk and should be avoided as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, the realm of mortals was much safer.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the heavily guarded Wanxian Alliance, the territory of the Five Elders appeared much more peaceful.</p><p></p><p>Except for those bordering and buffering regions with heavily armed forces.</p><p></p><p>In other regions, it felt as if there was no presence of war. The cultivators and mortals Li Qing encountered along the way seemed very relaxed, even a bit lazy.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing marveled at the governance of the Five Elders, being unable to help but admire their methods in subtly governing the populace.</p><p></p><p>Encountering no danger, Li Qing finally arrived at the territory of the Pure-Hearted Immortal Sect after passing through the realm of mortals.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the smooth journey was not only due to Li Qing's foundation in the Xuanyellow Way and his high level of concealment but perhaps also due to not being a member of the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>If it were a practitioner from the Wanxian Alliance, it would likely be difficult to infiltrate so easily.</p><p></p><p>This place was called the Yilv State.</p><p></p><p>As the name suggested, it was a vast fertile plain as far as the eye could see.</p><p></p><p>One could even see mortal merchant caravans traveling between cities.</p><p></p><p>In contrast to the Wanxian Alliance cultivators and mortals residing separately, in each city of the Five Elders, mortals and practitioners coexisted.</p><p></p><p>There was just a boundary between the inner and outer cities.</p><p></p><p>"I feel like I've been here before..."</p><p></p><p>Suppressing these stray thoughts in an instant, Li Qing began to search for his target.</p><p></p><p>According to the information received from his original self, the key to entering the true Pure-Hearted Immortal Sect was to attract the attention of the Pure-Hearted Heavenly Venerate.</p><p></p><p>The erotic artwork secretly circulated within the Five Elders was the most rapid and effective method.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the operation this time seemed to be less smooth.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing wandered in the Yilv State for several days without encountering those bold traders.</p><p></p><p>However, this was understandable. After all, spreading such things under the eyes of the Venerates would undoubtedly lead to death penalties.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Qing was thinking of moving to another state and trying his luck again, a sudden commotion broke out in the usually quiet city.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's heart stirred, following the crowd to the center of the incident.</p><p></p><p>"So you are Wan Zailai?!"</p><p></p><p>Several martial practitioners surrounded a charming young man in white robes, wearing hostile expressions.</p><p></p><p>"To think you've been found out. But it's also good, after resting for a few days, it's time to get back to work." Wan Zailai glanced around with a sidelong glance; under his gaze, the surrounding martial practitioners subconsciously took a half step back.</p><p></p><p>This caused the martial practitioners of Yilv State to frown.</p><p></p><p>One of them, annoyed, said, "Just a mere Golden Core cultivator dares to speak so arrogantly! Saying that all of us in the Yilv State are nothing but incompetent!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll teach you a lesson today!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Pei, you're already at the Yuan Infant stage, isn't it inappropriate to bully the weak?" someone couldn't help but advise.</p><p></p><p>Before the man surnamed Pei could speak, Wan Zailai chuckled, "And what if he's at the Yuan Infant stage? I see him just like an ordinary chicken and dog!"</p><p></p><p>Upon Wan Zailai's declaration, the cultivators of Yilv State all showed anger on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Good!"</p><p></p><p>"Yilv State, Pei Qingshan, please enlighten me!"</p><p></p><p>With Pei Qingshan's statement, a transparent round structure suddenly appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the astonishment of the crowd, the structure resembling an arena cast two rays of light and drew the two combatants into it.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Trial Ground of the Heavenly Venerate!"</p>

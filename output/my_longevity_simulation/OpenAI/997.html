        <h1>Chapter 997</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Xuansushang appeared in front of Shuofeng, with a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>However, at the very first moment, Luxi-chan tried to contact the outside world but found it impossible to connect.</p><p></p><p>"The insignificant ones, kneel in the presence of the Law Transmission Celestial Being!"</p><p></p><p>Four voices thundered in their ears.</p><p></p><p>In the dim sky, it seemed as if the Law Transmission Celestial Being had really appeared.</p><p></p><p>Staring down without anger.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A huge invisible pressure suddenly descended, and the bamboo building instantly turned to dust.</p><p></p><p>The entire ground trembled and sank several feet in a roaring sound.</p><p></p><p>Xuansushang and the other two were momentarily locked in place by this pressure, unable to move!</p><p></p><p>Before they could even struggle, they saw the sky, shrouded in shadows, reveal five bloody moons.</p><p></p><p>"Draw threads!"</p><p></p><p>A cold voice without any emotion sounded from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of threads descended from the blood moon.</p><p></p><p>Like countless tentacles, they silently and swiftly flew towards them, entwining them.</p><p></p><p>The threads seemed invisible, but the moment they touched their bodies, a sudden sense of weakness arose from the depths of their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Xichan!" Xuansushang and Shuofeng both had armor suddenly appearing on their bodies.</p><p></p><p>But it couldn't stop the invisible threads.</p><p></p><p>Luxi-chan's situation was even worse. Around her, silver symbols representing formations appeared one after another, only to quickly disappear without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Sweat beaded on Luxi-chan's forehead, her eyes first filled with shock and then became hard to conceal her fear.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic battle may have been incomprehensible to others who were not well-versed in formations, but Luxi-chan clearly understood. Every time she set up a formation, a mysterious force would instantly break it when it was formed!</p><p></p><p>Even before the formation took shape, it was tragically broken!</p><p></p><p>As if the other party had known in advance what formations she wanted to set up, the speed at which the formations were broken was simply unthinkable!</p><p></p><p>At first, Luxi-chan thought there was a traitor in her Formation Hall leaking all the formations she had mastered.</p><p></p><p>But soon, as she brought out the formations she had kept in reserve, she faced the same outcome: the formations were instantly broken!</p><p></p><p>As a result, Luxi-chan's fear gradually spread uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>She felt as though she had returned to the first time she saw her Master.</p><p></p><p>The powerful formations displayed by the Master had amazed, intoxicated, and fascinated her. Her once proud talent was simply not worth mentioning in front of him.</p><p></p><p>And now, the presence of formations breaking around her was even surpassing that of her Master!</p><p></p><p>It was a realm she could not even imagine!</p><p></p><p>"Who could it be?"</p><p></p><p>As the proud Chief of the Formation Hall of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance, Luxi-chan could feel herself shattered, seeing countless faces of her Master in the shadows around her.</p><p></p><p>"Xichan, you really disappoint me!"</p><p></p><p>"From now on, don't tell anyone you're my disciple, I can't afford to lose face because of you!"</p><p></p><p>"Luxi-chan, I won't rest in peace!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"No, Master...” Trembling with fear after the hallucination, Luxi-chan completely lost her resistance for a while.</p><p></p><p>Thick shadows completely enveloped her, and she disappeared into the bamboo forest.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Xuansushang couldn't help but pale. But facing the Law Transmission Celestial Being above and the encirclement of numerous threads, she was already at her wits’ end.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Xingwang, I have temporarily sealed Luxi-chan. However, just now..." Mo Rubin's voice came with some doubt.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I just happened to break through her mental weakness. Who would have thought that the renowned Chief of the Formation Hall in the world is actually a coward who fears the Master so much..." Li Fan responded with a sinister smirk.</p><p></p><p>"I see." As the battle was not yet over, Mo Rubin did not dwell on this matter.</p><p></p><p>"My remaining power is rapidly fading. I'm afraid it's not enough to seal Xuansushang and Shuofeng..."</p><p></p><p>"No matter, they are already doomed."</p><p></p><p>While the two briefly communicated, the offensive remained deadly.</p><p></p><p>The three members of Tianyang enforced the formation, and even with the protective armor, Xuansushang was as vulnerable as a drifting leaf under the combined spiritual pressure of the four Unification Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>The crimson light protected her mind, but the gaze of the Law Transmission Celestial Being in the sky kept pressing down.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xuansushang also realized that the illusion above her head was not the Law Transmission Celestial Being itself.</p><p></p><p>It was just the best representation to intimidate her mentally in the first place.</p><p></p><p>After all, assisting the Tianxuan Mirror to divide human avatars had violated the system established by the Law Transmission Celestial Being.</p><p></p><p>It was impossible for Xuansushang not to feel fear.</p><p></p><p>Although not the actual Law Transmission Celestial Being, the pressure it brought to Xuansushang remained unaltered.</p><p></p><p>And the constant eerie laughter from the shadows around her made Xuansushang surrounded by hallucinations, making it difficult to resist.</p><p></p><p>Since the battle started, the gray threads entwining her had been increasing.</p><p></p><p>Her thoughts and movements became slow as a result.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you, really?"</p><p></p><p>Before losing consciousness, Xuansushang's mind was flooded with countless unresolved thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The two Unification Realm experts were already subdued, and the subsequent battle was without suspense.</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng's transformation into a Divine Being was already out of reach.</p><p></p><p>Under the spiritual coercion of the four Unification Realm experts, she had long passed out.</p><p></p><p>The remaining cultivators in the bamboo sea cave were all sealed in the Heavenly Realm, and Li Fan watched the two Unification Realm female cultivators who were now unconscious.</p><p></p><p>Both had unparalleled beauty, Luxi-chan with an elegant temperament and Xuansushang resembling a young girl, still retaining a hint of innocence.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Xingwang, my power is dissipating, so I leave this to you for now."</p><p></p><p>The boundless shadows that enveloped the bamboo sea converged into a figure that eventually turned into a phantom.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Li Fan and said slowly, "If you have any news about the Tianxuan Mirror Avatar, contact me as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>"Occupying a body has been completely destroyed, remember to bring it along next time we meet."</p><p></p><p>"Or in the hidden Heavenly Realm from last time."</p><p></p><p>The voice gradually dissipated with the shadow.</p><p></p><p>"This battle went so smoothly, Mo Rubin's shadow technique was indispensable."</p><p></p><p>"Even though they are not adversaries, I felt pressured. Even in a moment of confusion, I saw the appearance of the Heavenly Physician and the Immortal of Xianxu in the darkness..."</p><p></p><p>"Tianxuan Dao... truly extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>With a passing thought, Li Fan's attention once again focused on Xuansushang and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, should we evacuate now?" Baihuadaoren asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan shook his head, "You all go to the bamboo sea here and guard the entrance."</p><p></p><p>"I will interrogate about the Tianxuan Mirror Avatar on the spot."</p><p></p><p>The three left to carry out their orders.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then took out two "Real Bait Fruits."</p><p></p><p>"Only these two are left, it seems it's time to request more from the Five Elders' Guild."</p><p></p><p>Narrowing his eyes, Li Fan began weaving intricate lies slowly.</p>

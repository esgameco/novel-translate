        <h1>Chapter 957</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Just before, the Tianyi who created the Yunshuitianguan boundless desolate An in person, his expression throughout the process was extremely indifferent.</p><p></p><p>There was even a sense of enjoyment deep in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The level of perverted behavior made Lifan feel inferior.</p><p></p><p>But the later Tianyi, the anger and regret in his eyes, were impossible to conceal.</p><p></p><p>The slight trembling of his body also clearly indicated his current feelings.</p><p></p><p>Tianyi slightly opened his mouth, as if saying something.</p><p></p><p>But the reconstructed picture stopped here.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lifan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"Someone disguised themselves as Tianyi and slaughtered the entire Yunshuitianguan?"</p><p></p><p>"Tianyi arrived late, but was powerless to reverse the situation?"</p><p></p><p>Recalling the words Tianyi said to Tianyu and Tianjue before, "What you see may not necessarily be the truth."</p><p></p><p>And the act of Tianyi treating Tianjue and sealing Yunshuitianguan.</p><p></p><p>Lifan couldn't help but draw this conclusion.</p><p></p><p>"However, simple framing and shifting blame can still be explained. Why hasn't the misunderstanding been resolved, but instead, deepened among the people of Yunshuitianguan over thousands of years of torment?"</p><p></p><p>Lifan was also puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the answer to this question can be found from Hanhai."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lifan made a decision.</p><p></p><p>Once again experiencing the nightmare cycle, when the impostor Tianyi used darkness to conceal Hanhai's perception. </p><p></p><p>Lifan, like a ray of light, slightly illuminated the darkness.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he kept replaying the previous reconstructed scenes, trying to awaken Hanhai's sleeping consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Awaken! Awaken!"</p><p></p><p>"The culprit is not Tianyi!"</p><p></p><p>"The real culprit is someone else! Someone impersonating Tianyi, sowing discord!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The fluctuations of divine consciousness continued to reverberate in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, like stirring up huge waves, the surrounding space began to shake and become unstable.</p><p></p><p>"Shut up! Shut up!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't think you can deceive me!"</p><p></p><p>"The Honored Elders enforce the law of the heavens. How can anyone else impersonate it?"</p><p></p><p>"Appearance and aura can be false, but how could they fake the authority of the heavenly realm wielded?"</p><p></p><p>As if Lifan's chattering had stirred up Hanhai's anger.</p><p></p><p>A blue face appeared in the spherical space around him.</p><p></p><p>Hanhai, like looking at an enemy, stared at Lifan full of resentment, this well-meaning person trying to awaken him.</p><p></p><p>"You rogue! Trying to deceive me!"</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's not Tianyi! It's another Honored Elder!"</p><p></p><p>"They all deserve to die!"</p><p></p><p>"You deserve to die too!"</p><p></p><p>The voice thundered, and black streaks of light emerged from Hanhai's illusory giant face.</p><p></p><p>Then tens of thousands of blue giant palms struck together, directly crushing Lifan's divine consciousness trapped in the middle!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Hmph."</p><p></p><p>In the real Yunshuitianguan, Lifan, who had lost contact with his separated divine consciousness, grunted.</p><p></p><p>But this minor injury was quickly repaired through the natural operation of the "Wujingyingxu Method."</p><p></p><p>"Authority of the heavenly realm, enforcing the law, the Honored Elders..."</p><p></p><p>Lifan narrowed his eyes, recalling the words Hanhai said in anger just now.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder their memories were tortured into madness, always firmly believing they had not identified the wrong culprit."</p><p></p><p>"Besides appearance, what truly represents their identity is the authority of the heavenly realm wielded."</p><p></p><p>"Tianjue should be the way of killing."</p><p></p><p>"Tianyi, obviously, represents the path of healing."</p><p></p><p>Lifan couldn't help but think of the scene when he first met Tianyu.</p><p></p><p>The green ox pulls the cart, and the two guards of inexplicable power protect the doorway.</p><p></p><p>Tianyu, like a master, teaches all the practitioners who enter the hut.</p><p></p><p>This can be considered their essence, and this point hadn't changed even though Tianyu appeared strange.</p><p></p><p>"The heavenly laws are severe, and the Honored Elders follow the rules."</p><p></p><p>"I have obtained the law today, spreading it to all beings."</p><p></p><p>"The heavenly laws cannot be violated."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lifan remembered the sound of reading he vaguely heard outside the hut.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the heavenly realm is the name of the little world where Tianyi and others reside."</p><p></p><p>Unlike the people of the Xuanhuang realm who all want to seize the heavens, in the heavenly realm, the status of the heavenly path seems extremely high.</p><p></p><p>"Tianjue, Tianyu, Tianyi, they are more like representatives of the heavenly path rather than powerful Longevity cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"The practitioners of the Xuanhuang realm stole the power of longevity from the Ruo Mu fruit. In the heavenly realm, perhaps because there is no Ruo Mu, the only way for the practitioners to achieve longevity is to become the wielders of the heavenly realm."</p><p></p><p>All the clues from the past suddenly connected, and Lifan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Underneath it all, the past secrets about Tianyi gradually surfaced.</p><p></p><p>Lifan also thought of the scene when Zhang Haobo watched and comprehended the sword hilt trapped by the Qingfeng. After his death, the revelation in the falling sky of the Xuanhuang Heavenly Path displayed the message that the Dao Foundation was achieved through the "Heavenly Killing Sword Intention."</p><p></p><p>But after encountering Tianjue, the people of Yunshuitianguan all referred to the sword used by Tianjue as "Heavenly Killing."</p><p></p><p>Originally, Lifan had vaguely guessed that this might be the sword evolving differently in different worlds.</p><p></p><p>Now confirmed.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Killing, like Tianjue, Tianyu, they might also be a kind of authority of the heavens."</p><p></p><p>"With both types of authority in Tianjue's hands, perhaps this is also the reason he managed to preserve his life, not turning into something strange, but becoming mad."</p><p></p><p>"Only a Tianyi who went out for some reason was spared."</p><p></p><p>"When he returns, it will be too late; the heavenly realm has already become a dead zone..."</p><p></p><p>Who is the person who disguised themselves as Tianyi and committed the crime?</p><p></p><p>According to Hanhai's words, it was definitely not as simple as changing appearance.</p><p></p><p>This person clearly wielded the authority of the heavenly realm, so much so that he was considered a "Honored Elder" by the people of Yunshuitianguan.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, he could freely switch between Tianyi and Tianjue...</p><p></p><p>The strength of this person is truly unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>What is even more puzzling is, what grudge does such power have with the heavenly realm?</p><p></p><p>Not only did they want to slaughter the sect completely, but they also wanted to plunge the heavenly realm into endless internal strife after its destruction.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside Hanhai's residence, Lifan frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Did Tianyi send me here to guide me towards knowing the truth of what happened back then?"</p><p></p><p>"The black resentment entwining Hanhai is accumulated over thousands of years, and it seems that with my current medical skills, I may not be able to resolve it."</p><p></p><p>"However, I can see that this seems to be the result of multiple purifications. Apparently, in these years, Tianyi has not completely abandoned the people of Yunshuitianguan."</p><p></p><p>"Even though they have transformed into something strange."</p><p></p><p>"Well..."</p><p></p><p>Deeds speak louder than words, and Lifan's vigilance rating towards Tianyi slightly decreased due to this way of acting.</p>

            <p>He contemplated on countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had calmed down, he was not extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>After all, the current situation was far from being at the end of the road for him.</p><p></p><p>In the vast world of Xuanhuang, without reaching the realm of truth, life only grants one chance.</p><p></p><p>He had merely returned to the same starting point as all sentient beings.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he still possessed the significant advantage of insights accumulated over countless reincarnations from previous lives.</p><p></p><p>"All things stem from an occasional thought in the beginning."</p><p></p><p>"While creating a clone using my refined blood, I integrated a trace of Mister Bai's charm."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered quickly.</p><p></p><p>Soon he identified the various anomalies within himself.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, there's no free lunch in the world."</p><p></p><p>"By resembling Mister Bai, I gained unparalleled talent and grasped some divine abilities."</p><p></p><p>"In return, my clone, and even my true self, were subtly tainted by it."</p><p></p><p>"Although, at the first sign of something amiss, I had been on guard. Once I noticed the impact on my true self, I had to return to my true form immediately."</p><p></p><p>"But what I didn't anticipate was that by the time my true self realized this, it was already too late."</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's mind, the stunning and flawless face appeared once again for an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Mister Bai..."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>"Wishing for my rebirth? Then, let me fulfill your wish!"</p><p></p><p>A glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Philosophizing Stone in his mind, which had been overloaded to the extreme, suddenly erupted in a full blue brilliance.</p><p></p><p>Countless scenes flickered within it.</p><p></p><p>These were the different possibilities that Li Fan had deduced about the future.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to obstruct my path..."</p><p></p><p>"It won't be that simple!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the radiance of the Philosophizing Stone extinguished completely.</p><p></p><p>Yet, Li Fan had already thought of a strategy to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>With a hint of a cold smile on his lips, Li Fan sat down slowly, leisurely decrypting the data of the 'Boundless Spirit Illusion Law' once again.</p><p></p><p>The scene shifts back to Xu Bai's side.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the Sacred Embryo, both of them revealed eerie smiles simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai gently pointed at the red rope in front of him, saying, "Go!"</p><p></p><p>The red rope, as if coming alive, flew straight towards the Sacred Embryo.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Xu Bai took out stacks of top-grade spirit stones from his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>With a single slap, he shattered them.</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Blood Embryo Technique, which created offspring or clones, did not possess cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, for Xu Bai, the Sacred Embryo, this was not an issue at all.</p><p></p><p>His aptitude was similar to Xu Bai's, having already reached an unimaginable level and having accumulated years of cultivation experience due to Li Fan's reincarnations.</p><p></p><p>"Absorb the essence of heaven and earth to control its energy!"</p><p></p><p>Sacred Embryo Xu Bai intoned slowly.</p><p></p><p>Within the secret chamber, an invisible whirlwind seemed to stir.</p><p></p><p>The substantial spiritual energy emitted a howling sound, rushing towards Sacred Embryo Xu Bai in torrents.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, he broke through the barrier between mortals and cultivators, successfully stepping into the Qi Refinement Initial Stage.</p><p></p><p>The speed of absorbing spiritual energy did not slow down; it only accelerated.</p><p></p><p>The clone Xu Bai remained indifferent, repeating the process of taking out top-grade spirit stones, shattering them, then taking out more of them.</p><p></p><p>If it were an ordinary cultivator absorbing so much spiritual energy in a short time, their body would likely have burst due to the pressure.</p><p></p><p>However, the Sacred Embryo Xu Bai seemed to be a bottomless pit, absorbing all the spiritual energy into his dantian.</p><p></p><p>His realm too was visibly ascending rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Mid Qi Refinement, Late Qi Refinement, Consummation of Qi Refinement!</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Calamity that troubled numerous cultivators seemed to be non-existent on Sacred Embryo Xu Bai!</p><p></p><p>The clone Xu Bai witnessed firsthand the terrifying cultivation speed of a truly top-tier new law cultivator without any bottleneck hindrances.</p><p></p><p>"Use the wonders of the False Heavens and Earth to lay the foundation!"</p><p></p><p>Sacred Embryo Xu Bai intoned again.</p><p></p><p>Within his dantian, the red rope emitted a faint glow.</p><p></p><p>Without any obstruction, everything fell into place effortlessly.</p><p></p><p>In just a breath's time, Sacred Embryo Xu Bai had successfully built his foundation.</p><p></p><p>The faint red rope dissolved into his dantian, becoming his foundation.</p><p></p><p>The true name of it was revealed as well.</p><p></p><p>"The Will of Heaven Sword."</p><p></p><p>"If there is the Will of Heaven, it shall be with me."</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful."</p><p></p><p>Sacred Embryo Xu Bai and the clone Xu Bai echoed in unison.</p><p></p><p>Despite stepping into the Foundation Establishment Stage, Sacred Embryo Xu Bai did not stop his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He continued to absorb the dense and pure spiritual energy within the secret chamber endlessly.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation realm also swiftly and steadily ascended.</p><p></p><p>Middle Foundation Establishment, Late Foundation Establishment, Consummation of Foundation Establishment...</p><p></p><p>"Peer into the laws of Heaven and Earth, and refine the Golden Dan."</p><p></p><p>Sacred Embryo Xu Bai stood with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>With a slight inhalation, the dense spiritual energy, which was on the verge of condensation into liquid in the secret chamber, vanished instantly.</p><p></p><p>He simply took over a storage ring filled with spirit stones handed to him by the clone Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Grasping it in his hand, a red light slowly materialized in his dantian.</p><p></p><p>"I will be the Will of Heaven, and my heart will be the Heart of Heaven."</p><p></p><p>Sacred Embryo Xu Bai naturally spoke these words slowly.</p><p></p><p>As if a ground-shaking explosion occurred.</p><p></p><p>The red light spread throughout his dantian.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, it condensed to its utmost limits.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a red light spot appeared in Sacred Embryo Xu Bai's dantian.</p><p></p><p>Sacred Embryo Xu Bai entered the Golden Dan Stage!</p><p></p><p>In such a short time, he achieved what ordinary cultivators would take decades, or even centuries, to accomplish.</p><p></p><p>He did not halt his cultivation pace.</p><p></p><p>The supply of spiritual energy continued unceasingly, propelling Sacred Embryo Xu Bai towards the Consummation of the Golden Dan stage.</p><p></p><p>As expected, no Heavenly Calamity emerged.</p><p></p><p>This duality in the world of Xuanhuang showcased the way of heaven.</p><p></p><p>And when Sacred Embryo Xu Bai ultimately ascended to the Consummation of the Golden Dan stage.</p><p></p><p>Barely half a day had passed since his creation.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the cultivation speed of Mister Bai?"</p><p></p><p>"No, Mister Bai back then was even faster. Changing from mortal to deity in an instant."</p><p></p><p>Within the secret chamber, Sacred Embryo Xu Bai and the clone Xu Bai engaged in a dialogue.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, the clone Xu Bai shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"In the current world of Xuanhuang, reaching the Golden Dan stage within half a day is already the limit."</p><p></p><p>Sacred Embryo Xu Bai nodded in agreement, "Absorb the spirit of heaven and earth to nurture the Yuan Ying."</p><p></p><p>"Without proper preparation, even with high talent, it's impossible to advance further."</p><p></p><p>"As the saying goes..."</p><p></p><p>Sacred Embryo Xu Bai bowed slightly towards the clone Xu Bai and gracefully exited, saying, "Before the immortal path, one cannot step; the ancestral founder is above!"</p><p></p><p>His figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>However, his voice continued to resonate in the secret chamber for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The clone Xu Bai knew that Sacred Embryo Xu Bai had gone out to seek opportunities to form the Yuan Ying.</p><p></p><p>For other cultivators, this process might be extremely arduous.</p><p></p><p>But for Sacred Embryo Xu Bai, it was a simple matter.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even need to worry about Sacred Embryo Xu Bai's safety.</p><p></p><p>Although he had only reached the Consummation of the Golden Dan stage for now, even Nascent Soul cultivators might not be his match.</p><p></p><p>Because...</p>

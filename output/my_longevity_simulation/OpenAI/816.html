        <h1>Chapter 816</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Cultivation and treasures cannot be obtained at the same time, which sometimes makes Li Fan feel a bit dilemma.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the bound item replacement function solved a major problem for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>However, acquiring anchor points was not easy.</p><p></p><p>So far, no method has been found to increase its charging progress.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, whether to replace it or not also needs to be carefully considered.</p><p></p><p>"However, I've already thought of a way to increase new anchor points."</p><p></p><p>"Just waiting for the opportunity to verify it myself."</p><p></p><p>With the hard work of Shang Tianci, the originally monotonous Lingmu Realm gradually showed various scenes.</p><p></p><p>With many miraculous scenes that should not exist, coupled with the majestic Ling Trees sitting in the world, the whole world seemed to be undergoing some wonderful changes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had refined the heart of the Lingmu, felt particularly sensitive to this.</p><p></p><p>"It's equivalent to plundering resources beyond the world and nurturing the world itself."</p><p></p><p>"The upper limit in the Lingmu Realm has already been set. But if there is a continuous supply from the outside world, maybe it can also undergo a so-called 'upgrade'."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully sensed whether there was any corresponding feedback cultivation appearing in his body for the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, after a long time of discernment, he still found nothing.</p><p></p><p>It may be that this realm has not yet undergone a real transformation. Or it may be that the concept of 'world' does not fall within the scope of the anchoring technique. </p><p></p><p>But another source of feedback cultivation was clear.</p><p></p><p>Upon careful examination, Li Fan could faintly see the figures of people like Su Yuqing who had left the realm.</p><p></p><p>"Even in that transcendental environment beyond the realm, the artificially created cultivation field, one can still quickly enter the Qi Refinement Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that I need to speed up here too."</p><p></p><p>After making some arrangements, Li Fan did not bring Tianyang with him, but alone, he returned to the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the tense atmosphere in the several mainland states, the Congyun Sea remained relatively unchanged.</p><p></p><p>The clouds of war had not yet spread to this place, and one could still occasionally see cultivators' figures rushing between the various islands.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan concealed his figure and quietly flew to the western part of the central region of Congyun Sea, near an island named Haixuan.</p><p></p><p>Looking from afar, one could see a majestic large formation enveloping the island, emanating a killing intent that warned outsiders to stay away.</p><p></p><p>"The Taihuang Eight Extinct Dragon Formation, said to be jointly built by two Nascent Soul Formation Masters at a considerable cost. Cultivators below the Foundation Establishment stage who inadvertently enter it either die or get injured."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>The Lingmu Realm's end dissolving disc in his sea of knowledge emitted a dazzling white light. In an instant, he had already completely unraveled this seemingly impregnable formation in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Transforming into an invisible black thread, Li Fan flew into the formation without any sign of triggering a counterattack from the formation.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Ji, come on..."</p><p></p><p>From within Haixuan Island came the faint hums and playful voices of several women.</p><p></p><p>"Such fragrant wine! And such fragrant beauties!"</p><p></p><p>As well as the self-indulgent laughter of a middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quietly arrived above the island's cave mansion and looked down.</p><p></p><p>He saw that the owner of Haixuan Island, a Golden Core cultivator named Ji Shaoli, was holding two identical twin female cultivators, embracing their delicate bodies. Below, seven enchanting and alluring female cultivators were twisting their graceful bodies.</p><p></p><p>Even with Li Fan's discerning eyes, the nine female cultivators in the cave mansion could be considered above average in terms of looks.</p><p></p><p>"Ji Shaoli, the biggest winner in the history of Dingyu in the Congyun Sea, envied by countless cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"With a Foundation Establishment cultivation base, he has a fortune of five million spiritual stones."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that he indulges in pleasures and is stuck at the Golden Core Realm."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Information about the opponent instantly flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"For the sake of convenience and pleasure, he built a large harem on this island. In his leisure time, he selects beautiful women from the mortal realm to train in cultivation before enjoying them."</p><p></p><p>"To prevent outsiders from spying and protect his own life, two Nascent Soul Formation Masters were hired to arrange the Taihuang Eight Extinct Dragon Formation on the island."</p><p></p><p>"He's someone who knows how to enjoy life."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that the Red Flame descended. In the end, he can't escape death."</p><p></p><p>Observing from above, Li Fan waited for the fierce battle to end, for Ji Shaoli to embrace the female cultivators' voluptuous bodies and fall asleep deeply.</p><p></p><p>Then, as if a ghost, Li Fan descended beside him.</p><p></p><p>He used his Binding Insect Technique to control Ji Shaoli while his Illusory Clouds and Water Evian Technique enveloped the female cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>After they woke up, they would only think they had lost Ji Shaoli's favor and were expelled from the island.</p><p></p><p>As for Ji Shaoli...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan decided to replace him with his clone!</p><p></p><p>Since he wanted to watch the show from the sidelines in this world, he didn't necessarily have to join the Wuxian Alliance. But without the Tianxuan Mirror, it was inconvenient for information retrieval or trading goods.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Li Fan came up with a method.</p><p></p><p>Choosing Ji Shaoli had many reasons.</p><p></p><p>This person was already wealthy and could be considered a giant among cultivators from the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>By taking over Ji Shaoli's identity, Li Fan could save himself the trouble of accumulating wealth from scratch.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Haixuan Island was originally one of the many islands guarding the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>However, when the special products around it were exhausted, it lost its defensive value and fell into disuse.</p><p></p><p>After Ji Shaoli bought the island, he refurbished it. Now, the island's infrastructure was fully equipped: teleportation arrays to Wanxian Island, the Tianxuan small mirror, and everything else.</p><p></p><p>By occupying this island, Li Fan could save a lot of effort.</p><p></p><p>"Previously, I was worried that the Tianxuan Mirror would monitor the surrounding environment and expose my secrets. So I was always cautious and almost never carried it with me."</p><p></p><p>"But now that I have the End Dissolving Disc for protection, I don't need to worry about those things anymore."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Using the Purple Clouds Soul Viewing Technique, Li Fan completely controlled Ji Shaoli's secrets in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He also took his blood and, using the Mysterious Transformation of True Essence, created a clone that was exactly like him.</p><p></p><p>Then, he made a stone coffin for Ji Shaoli and sealed him, much like the treatment of Zhou Qing'ang by the 115th generation.</p><p></p><p>With a kind heart, Li Fan used the Illusory Clouds and Water Evian Technique to keep him forever immersed in the joyful dream of indulgence.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, the female cultivators left with some spiritual stones.</p><p></p><p>And Ji Shaoli had been suppressed by Li Fan deep within the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>Silently and without a sound, the ownership of Haixuan Island changed hands.</p><p></p><p>"Without the End Dissolving Disc to break the formation and deceive the Tianxuan Mirror, without the Mysterious Transformation of True Essence changing appearances, even if one could break through the island, it would not be easy to do as I did, seizing the wealth that originally belonged to him."</p><p></p><p>The clone Ji Shaoli checked the current contribution points he possessed.</p><p></p><p>Six million seven hundred and eighty thousand.</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, it was much more than he had when he won the major prize back then.</p><p></p><p>"Well, from the details of the transaction records, this Ji Shaoli can be considered a talent."</p><p></p><p>"Knowing how to make money with money, he won't end up spending it all."</p><p></p><p></p>

        <h1>Chapter 980</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The doppelganger Li Qing was refined using the essence blood of the transformed Su Yuqing from the Li Jieti as material, and further achieved the foundation of Dao with the miraculous black sword of the heavens. It is impossible for there to be a situation where one lacks the talent to enter the method of practice.</p><p></p><p>It seems that it is the limitation of the "Heavenly Elemental Art" itself.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan cast his gaze toward the disciple of the Elemental Cult who was lying limp in the corner.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, clearly knowing the contents of the method of practice, but there is no memory of the Elemental Art in the soul. It can only be extracted through torture. Is the method of practice stored within the physical body?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan swept his divine sense over the fainted Elemental Cult disciple and carefully examined it.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's current familiarity with the human body, he quickly discovered clues.</p><p></p><p>Inside the disciple of the Elemental Cult, there existed an imprint, engraved in the flesh and blood, forming a unique inscription. This kind of imprint seemed to have no effect on the physical body, but Li Fan keenly observed the traces of the operation of the method of practice remaining on it.</p><p></p><p>Even though this Elemental Cult disciple had already switched to a new method, the imprint left by years of practicing the method had not completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"The imprint stores the method of practice and also serves as a form of certification. Only by meeting the certification can one cultivate the 'Heavenly Elemental Art'â€¦"</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, Li Fan's divine sense moved away from the Elemental Cult disciple, who was now just a pool of flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>It was not that he was ruthless and wanted to kill and silence the person.</p><p></p><p>But as he peered into the imprint of the Elemental Art, it triggered its own protection. The imprint self-destructed, tearing the disciple's body apart in the process.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Li Fan had already recorded all the imprints before this happened.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was extremely intricate, with just one glance, the Dao Transformation Stone could perfectly replicate it.</p><p></p><p>Narrowing his eyes, Li Fan used his hand as a brush to draw in the void.</p><p></p><p>The imprint of the Elemental Art gradually took shape.</p><p></p><p>It resembled a human, composed of more than 128,000 different "parts," intricately linked.</p><p></p><p>As the imprint reappeared, it seemed to have its own spirituality and actually began to move.</p><p></p><p>First, it hesitantly looked around to identify the directions, and then slowly floated towards the pool of mud on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not stop it, only observing silently.</p><p></p><p>After the human-shaped imprint attached to the flesh and blood, the originally lifeless flesh began to squirm. The imprint served as the skeleton, and the flesh as the exterior.</p><p></p><p>Reassembling.</p><p></p><p>The entire process was quite eerie, but what amazed Li Fan even more was yet to come.</p><p></p><p>Although the method of practice imprint reshaped the body, it did not bring the disciple back to life. It was just a mindless entity, and its appearance was not restored.</p><p></p><p>Purely a creation fused of flesh and blood, its first and only mission upon entering this world was to cross its legs and then activate the "Heavenly Elemental Art."</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy slowly gathered within the body of the bloody creation, and before long, Li Fan sensed the fluctuations of the method of practice being activated within it.</p><p></p><p>Like a machine made of flesh and blood, even without the disciple's life as a "vessel," it could tirelessly practice the "Heavenly Elemental Art."</p><p></p><p>The flesh and blood machine had no intelligence, disregarding Li Fan and Li Qing, simply following the set commands and executing the task.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder that mysterious Elemental Cult leader was able to find enough cultivators initially to practice, allowing the gains from the method of practice to directly counteract the side effects of incompatible cultivation paths."</p><p></p><p>"It turns out that it relied on these mindless flesh and blood puppets."</p><p></p><p>A look of interest flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Even in death, they can continue to operate the method of practice with their instincts. It seems to rely on those imprints. I've never heard of this before. It seems that this Elemental Cult leader also had secrets."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, even with the Supreme Law's intervention, there is no difference between them and ants. Death is unavoidable."</p><p></p><p>Of course, it cannot be ruled out that the Elemental Cult leader was not in Jiushan Prefecture at the time and luckily escaped the disaster.</p><p></p><p>As long as he verifies it now...</p><p></p><p>At Li Fan's signal, the doppelganger Li Qing immediately sat cross-legged and also engraved the Elemental Art imprint within his body like Li Fan did.</p><p></p><p>The main body carefully felt the subtle changes happening within as the imprint constantly increased.</p><p></p><p>Only when the imprint fully reappeared and connected into one, did Li Fan vaguely sense its impact on the flesh.</p><p></p><p>In simpler terms, it was like stamping an imprint on the body.</p><p></p><p>"Practice the Heavenly Elemental Art." Li Fan squinted and said.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing nodded slightly, attempting to activate the Elemental Art once again without obstruction and quickly entered the introductory stage of practice.</p><p></p><p>"Except for us, there is no one else in the entire Xuanhuang Realm practicing this method anymore."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Elemental Cult leader has truly died."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The reasoning was simple. Although the Elemental Cult leader might not have personally practiced the Elemental Art, this method must have been highly beneficial to him. Otherwise, he wouldn't have gone through all the efforts to establish the Elemental Cult and spread the method.</p><p></p><p>If he were still alive, he would have definitely staged a comeback. Having a method to control flesh and blood puppets, it would not have been difficult for him to rise again.</p><p></p><p>However, it has been such a long time since the destruction of Jiushan Prefecture, and there are still no new cultivators starting to practice the Elemental Art. Even those who were previously practicing had all given up.</p><p></p><p>"No matter how many plans you have, in the face of absolute strength difference, they are ultimately useless."</p><p></p><p>Although the Heavenly Elemental Art definitely still held secrets, Li Fan decided to use it first.</p><p></p><p>And then unravel it slowly.</p><p></p><p>"First, create some flesh and blood puppets and set the Elemental Art in motion." Li Fan instructed.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing immediately complied and left to carry out the order.</p><p></p><p>"If all goes well, there will soon be a continuous output of cultivators in this small world."</p><p></p><p>"I don't expect them to directly confront the Five Elders. They just need to 'help me mend the sky.'"</p><p></p><p>"The blood-colored river has no end in sight, and the time span is too long. However, the majority of history is inconsequential. The most crucial moments..."</p><p></p><p>"When Xuantianwang returned from the immortal realm, established the Xuantian Sect, and then mysteriously disappeared."</p><p></p><p>"And the end of the reign of the Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao, where the Law Transcendent rose unexpectedly, and White Ancestor became the Law Transcendent of the past and present."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"Let's first understand what happened during these two periods."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew well that by using these small-world cultivators to extract historical fragments from the creation history, it was like fishing in a pond.</p><p></p><p>It was random, and what could be obtained depended entirely on luck.</p><p></p><p>However, after enough attempts, valuable information could always be obtained.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing was highly efficient in his work.</p><p></p><p>For the practice of the method of practice, the influence of the Immortal-Folk Plague had to be considered. Things were urgent, and eventually, the materials were collected from within the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, after about ten days, enough flesh and blood puppets had been created.</p><p></p><p>As for the disappearance of many Foundation Establishment cultivators within the domain of the Myriad Immortal Alliance, it did not cause much of a stir.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p>

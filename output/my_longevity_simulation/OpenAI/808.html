        <h1>Chapter 808</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The draft box has stored a halfway written side story for a long time. While the inspiration is still there, I quickly wrote it out.</p><p></p><p>Don't delay the normal update at night. There are still two normal chapters tonight.</p><p></p><p>----------------------------------</p><p></p><p>"Ding dong!"</p><p></p><p>I was suddenly startled by the sound of the phone notification, waking me up from my sleep.</p><p></p><p>After half a minute of recovery, my pounding heart finally calmed down slowly. I picked up my phone from the table and checked the time.</p><p></p><p>2:30 in the morning.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, sending messages at this time, it must be that old guy Zhang Yaobin!"</p><p></p><p>Cursing in my mind, I opened the messaging app and sure enough.</p><p></p><p>"Li Yang, check your email. Write a research report based on the information in it, around 30,000 words. Before noon tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by Zhang Yaobin's sly smile in the profile picture, instantly made my eyelids twitch and blood pressure rise.</p><p></p><p>In my mind, I had already greeted his ancestors for numerous generations, but my fingers involuntarily started tapping on the phone keyboard.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, boss!"</p><p></p><p>I sighed.</p><p></p><p>"No choice, I got stuck with such a supervisor. Hang in there, once this paper gets successfully published, I can graduate."</p><p></p><p>"Six reviewers, four of them are Zhang Yaobin's friends. Whether the paper gets approved or not, it's all up to him. Before the review period is over, he will definitely treat me as a workhorse. Really pushing it this time."</p><p></p><p>Complaining in my mind, I opened the email, downloaded the attachment, unzipped it, and started looking at its contents.</p><p></p><p>"Inverting the principles of heaven and earth, proving eternal life..."</p><p></p><p>"What on earth is this?"</p><p></p><p>My drowsiness disappeared instantly, and I couldn't help but straighten my posture, staring closely at the image on the computer.</p><p></p><p>A strange event occurred in the Baixi Boundary area of Xiangnan Province half a month ago. A mountain peak of a kilometer high split open revealing a smooth as a mirror cliff. On the cliff, nine large characters were inscribed from top to bottom in ancient seal script: "Inverting the principles of heaven and earth, proving eternal life."</p><p></p><p>The local government acted promptly. The site was quickly sealed off after the incident. This matter is not yet known to the public.</p><p></p><p>Because the ancient seal script that wrote these nine characters dated back 7,000 years to the Xian Dynasty period, the investigation team invited Chief Expert Zhang Yaobin, who studies Xian Dynasty history domestically, to assist in the investigation.</p><p></p><p>To see if they could find some clues in ancient books.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>I checked the time in the lower right corner of the screen.</p><p></p><p>"It's not April Fool's Day today, why play this joke on me."</p><p></p><p>As soon as I saw this information, my initial reaction was disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Lingyun Peak, over 1,300 meters. The first peak in the Baixi Boundary area..."</p><p></p><p>I quickly searched for the mountain mentioned in the event.</p><p></p><p>"Nine characters, over a thousand meters. From the spacing of the characters in the picture, each character is at least a hundred meters in size."</p><p></p><p>"Even now, it would be a major project to engrave them on the mountain cliff."</p><p></p><p>"A 7,000-year-old Xian Dynasty? How is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>"Although these characters are really well-written."</p><p></p><p>My thoughts stalled for a moment.</p><p></p><p>However, the old guy Zhang Yaobin, ugly as he may be with his capitalist aura, was very reliable when it came to work. He wouldn't be messing around with fictional things just to tease me.</p><p></p><p>I quickly searched for related news about the Baixi Boundary area online.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, I found something suspicious.</p><p></p><p>"Family, I'm just speechless. Finally took off for the year, wanted to tour Baixi Boundary. Arrived at the entrance of the scenic area, but suddenly couldn't get in! Who understands this feeling!"</p><p></p><p>"Emergency at Baixi Boundary, the scenic area is temporarily closed. For self-safety considerations, please cooperate, dear tourists!"</p><p></p><p>"I might not believe it when I say it, but what did I really see in Baixi Boundary..."</p><p></p><p>Before I could click on it, this content had already been deleted.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like there's something fishy going on."</p><p></p><p>"The Xian Dynasty..."</p><p></p><p>Rubbing my chin, memories about it started to resurface in my mind.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Xian Dynasty was the first dynasty with documented records.</p><p></p><p>And there was a huge cultural gap between it and the second dynasty, Yu, spanning almost eight hundred years. To this day, no one knows what happened during those lost eight hundred years. How the flourishing ancient Xian Dynasty met its end still remains a mystery.</p><p></p><p>Although my research direction was not the Xian Dynasty, due to the scarcity of the remaining relics from that era, they had all been thoroughly researched. I had no choice but to change directions.</p><p></p><p>However, bowing to the old thief Zhang Yaobin, though he looked a bit ugly and had a strong capitalist aura, he was very reliable when it came to work. Perhaps I might have to endure being ordered around like a cow and horse until this paper gets successfully published.</p><p></p><p>But what caught my attention was the inscription of these nine characters at Lingyun Peak.</p><p></p><p>Having a cup of coffee, staying up late and finishing the material the old thief sent me, it was already nearly dawn.</p><p></p><p>But my doubt grew even stronger.</p><p></p><p>The "Inverting the principles of heaven and earth, proving eternal life" inscription in those nine big characters, were still engraved in my mind.</p><p></p><p>The second I woke up the next day, the first thing I did was check my phone.</p><p></p><p>"Li Yang, don't forget, by tomorrow noon."</p><p></p><p>The old thief had sent another message.</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the urge to curse, I checked the time.</p><p></p><p>"I only slept for four hours..."</p><p></p><p>"Why does it feel like I've slept for three days and nights?"</p><p></p><p>I moved my sore body a bit and quickly fixed myself some breakfast.</p><p></p><p>Then I started writing the research report.</p><p></p><p>"There are still 28,000 words left, and 27 hours remaining. With my speed, it should be easy to manage!"</p><p></p><p>I knew that this was just a task from the old thief to impress his superiors, and not a real academic endeavor.</p><p></p><p>So, I tried to fill it with as much empty talk and clich√©s as possible, diverting the focus to "auspiciousness."</p><p></p><p>"Auspiciousness is not superstition, it's real."</p><p></p><p>One of the most famous and popular themes was the "Five Stars Rising in the East" unearthed in the last century. Shortly after its discovery, the national fortune turned around. Flourishing and towering above the world's great powers.</p><p></p><p>"Since this long-lived stone carving appeared, shouldn't our people's average lifespan increase by three to four years?" I suddenly thought of it.</p><p></p><p>My fingers danced on the keyboard and I kept thinking.</p><p></p><p>I managed to finish the report before midnight.</p><p></p><p>I clicked send and sighed in relief.</p><p></p><p>I had completed the old thief's task. At this moment, I should have been relaxing.</p><p></p><p>But for some reason, that kilometer-long carvings returned to my mind.</p><p></p><p>Having a cup of coffee, and browsing through the new Baixi Boundary related news online, I finally found something questionable.</p><p></p><p>"Relatives, I'm just speechless. Finally took a vacation, wanted to visit Baixi Boundary. Arrived at the entrance of the scenic area, but suddenly we're not allowed in! Who can understand this feeling!"</p><p></p><p>"Emergency in Baixi Boundary, the scenic area temporarily closed. For self-safety concerns, please cooperate!"</p><p></p><p>"I may not be believed when I say what I saw in the Baixi Boundary..."</p><p></p><p>I was about to click on it, but the content had already been deleted.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like there's something going on."</p><p></p><p>"The Xian Dynasty..."</p><p></p><p>I rubbed my chin, thinking back to what I knew about it.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Xian Dynasty was the first dynasty with documented records, and it presented a huge gap in civilization with the next dynasty, Yu, spanning almost eight hundred years. To date, no one knows what happened during this lost period. How the flourishing ancient Xian Dynasty met its demise remains a mystery.</p><p></p><p>But despite my research focusing on other areas, my exposure to the teachings of the senior thief Zhang Yaobin, who had a strong grasp on Xian Dynasty history, had made me quite familiar with it.</p><p></p><p>However, the thousand-meter mountain carvings seemed a bit beyond my understanding.</p><p></p><p>I pondered for a moment and realized that as soon as I saw the information, my immediate reaction was disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Lingyun Peak, over 1,300 meters. The highest peak in the Baixi Boundary area..."</p><p></p><p>"Nine characters, over a thousand meters. From the spacing of the characters in the picture, it seems each character is at least a hundred meters in size."</p><p></p><p>"Even now, if they wanted to engrave these on the cliff, it would be a huge project."</p><p></p><p>"A 7,000-year-old Xian Dynasty? How is it possible?"</p><p></p><p>"Although these characters are really well done."</p><p></p><p>My mind halted for a moment.</p><p></p><p>But despite the senior thief Zhang Yaobin being a bit ugly and financially focused, he was quite reliable when it came to his work. He wouldn't mess around with fictitious topics to tease me.</p><p></p><p>I quickly browsed the news related to the Baixi Boundary area.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, I found some suspicious incidents.</p><p></p><p>I pondered for a moment and clicked to read more.</p><p></p><p>I suddenly felt sleepy, unable to resist the heavy drowsiness that came over me, and eventually, fell asleep.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like I had numerous dreams, but the one thing that stayed constant was the "Inverting the principles of heaven and earth, proving eternal life" that was deeply embedded in my mind. Despite waking up and falling asleep a few times, it remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>The next day, I woke up and the first thing I did was check my phone.</p><p></p><p>"Li Yang, don't forget, by tomorrow noon."</p><p></p><p>The old thief had sent another message reminding me.</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the urge to swear, I checked the time.</p><p></p><p>"I only slept for four hours..."</p><p></p><p>"Why does it feel like I've slept for three days and nights."</p><p></p><p>I stretched my sore body a bit and managed to have a simple breakfast.</p><p></p><p>Then, I started writing the report.</p><p></p><p>"I still have 28,000 words left, and 27 hours remaining. With my typing speed, it should be a walk in the park!"</p><p></p><p>I knew this was the old thief's way of impressing his superiors, not a legitimate academic endeavor.</p><p></p><p>So, I filled it with fluff and diverted it towards "auspiciousness."</p><p></p><p>"Auspiciousness isn't superstition, it's real."</p><p></p><p>The most famous and joyous one being the discovery of the "Five Stars Rising in the East" which after its excavation, led to a sudden change in the country's fortune.</p><p></p><p>"Since this long-lived stone carving appeared, shouldn't our people's average lifespan increase by three to four years?"</p><p></p><p>I suddenly thought of that and clicked send, relieved.</p><p></p><p>I was supposed to relax after completing the old thief's task but, for some reason, thoughts of the kilometer-long carving returned to my mind.</p><p></p><p>So, I browsed the new Baixi Boundary related news online and found something questionable.</p><p></p><p>"Family, I'm just speechless.

With my speed, I'm ready to finish this!"</p><p></p><p>I knew this was just a task from the old thief to impress his superiors, and not a real academic endeavor.</p><p></p><p>So, I filled it with fluff, trying to shift the focus towards "auspiciousness."</p><p></p><p>"Auspiciousness isn't superstition, it's real."</p><p></p><p>The excavation of the "Five Stars Rising in the East" had a notable impact, changing the country's prospects and elevating it among global superpowers.</p><p></p><p>"Since the appearance of this long-lasting stone carving, could it lead to an increase in our people's average lifespan by three to four years?"

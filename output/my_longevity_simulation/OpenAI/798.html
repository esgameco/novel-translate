            <p>Caressing it with his hand, it felt as delicate as a young girl's skin.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Gu Xinghan had intended to hand over this item.</p><p></p><p>But somehow, inexplicably, he ended up concealing the fact that he had found the jade disc.</p><p></p><p>Young Gu Xinghan was not a dishonest person.</p><p></p><p>So for several days in a row, feeling guilty like a thief, he dared not meet the eyes of the senior cultivators in the valley.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his naturally solitary nature and the chaos within the valley kept the other cultivators preoccupied with recovery, so nobody noticed his abnormality.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, he relaxed.</p><p></p><p>A child's curiosity is very heavy.</p><p></p><p>Sure he had found a treasure, in his spare time, Gu Xinghan busily studied the jade disc quietly.</p><p></p><p>However, to his immense disappointment, after many days had passed, he still couldn't figure out what exactly made the jade disc special or its specific purpose.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like just an ordinary piece of jade, only more aesthetically pleasing.</p><p></p><p>But due to the fantasies that everyone holds in their hearts, Gu Xinghan did not discard it.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he stored the jade disc in his Dantian, nurturing it with his own spiritual energy, taking great care of it.</p><p></p><p>As the Medicine King Valley was completely rebuilt, Gu Xinghan's attention was forced to shift.</p><p></p><p>Because the former sect master Li Fan tragically perished in the disaster, the future direction of the Medicine King Sect became a major issue.</p><p></p><p>The inheritance of the Medicine King Sect did not solely rely on blood relations. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan had inherited the position of sect master only because of Liu Ruchen's will.</p><p></p><p>And now, with Li Fan dead, the next potential sect master had not been decided.</p><p></p><p>If purely based on strength, undoubtedly, the sect master should come from among Liu San, Jiang Yushan, and Fang Zaiji, the three enlightened cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan and Fang Zaiji had little interest in power. The highest possibility was for Liu San to inherit.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Firstly, Liu San considered himself as Liu Ruchen's servant and believed he was unworthy of or ill-suited for the position of sect master.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the Medicine King Sect was not just facing the issue of sect master inheritance.</p><p></p><p>A greater crisis stemmed from the thousands of cultivators thrown out of the Medicine King Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>They were all ancient method cultivators, primarily practicing the Medicine King Sect's authentic "Sustaining Life and Prosperity Sutra".</p><p></p><p>Once they all awakened simultaneously, a massacre was likely to erupt within the Medicine King Sect.</p><p></p><p>Although they had all been collectively forced back into slumber by the three enlightened cultivators, without the Medicine King True Cauldron, this could only be maintained temporarily.</p><p></p><p>In such a short time, it was impossible to find enough cultivation techniques for these slumbering cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Considering various factors, Liu San and the others ultimately decided to follow in the footsteps of the Taiyan Sect and submit to the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Concerning the future of the Medicine King Sect, Liu San, feeling uneasy, personally went to observe the situation.</p><p></p><p>Upon his return, the three enlightened cultivators unanimously agreed.</p><p></p><p>Liu San formally visited the Wanxian Alliance to request submission.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Fang Zaiji took the opportunity to distribute the "End Times Discs" to key individuals in the sect, especially to the talented disciples he had retrieved, explaining how to use them and warning them to keep it a secret.</p><p></p><p>Though the Medicine King Sect did not have a prestigious reputation like the Ten Immortal Sects, their disciples were renowned for their charitable acts and helping others. Hence even after thousands of years, their legends still persisted. In terms of fame, they were not inferior to the Ten Immortal Sects.</p><p></p><p>Being the second world power to voluntarily submit, and with their overall strength relatively intact, the Wanxian Alliance valued the Medicine King Sect.</p><p></p><p>They appointed a Daoist Immortal named "Qingyun" to oversee the matter.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by Liu San, Qingyun visited the Medicine King Valley and was visibly pleased.</p><p></p><p>There were no major obstacles, and the two factions quickly reached an agreement for the Medicine King Sect to join the alliance.</p><p></p><p>The Medicine King Sect maintained relative independence, requiring every disciple to carry the Tianxuan Treasure Mirror, much like the ordinary Wanxian Alliance cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the incident of numerous sect cultivators infiltrating the Wanxian Alliance ahead of time, Qingyun did not delve deep into it.</p><p></p><p>Quickly, news spread throughout the Xuanhuang Realm about the Medicine King Sect joining the Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The world was shaken.</p><p></p><p>More and more small worlds hastened to surrender.</p><p></p><p>The Wanxian Alliance kept its promise and provided various support promptly.</p><p></p><p>The Beast World and the Medicine King Valley were brought under the light of the Tianxuan Treasure Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The Medicine King Sect finally received the much-needed cultivation techniques they had sought assistance for.</p><p></p><p>As each sleeping cultivator awakened and transitioned to new cultivation methods, the crisis within the Medicine King Sect finally subsided.</p><p></p><p>With the danger averted, the focus shifted towards the future.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Medicine King Sect had six enlightened cultivators, twenty-three Nascent Soul realm cultivators, and several Foundation Establishment realm cultivators, a considerable force in the current cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>However, despite the submission to the Wanxian Alliance, which served as the nominal leadership, the Medicine King Sect was still highly autonomous, with the sect leader possessing significant power.</p><p></p><p>Under such a system of high autonomy, even Enlightened cultivators were seldom immune to the allure of leadership.</p><p></p><p>After much overt and covert competition and to prevent the Medicine King Sect, which had just begun to recover, from once again falling apart, through a voting resolution, Liu San eventually inherited the position of sect master.</p><p></p><p>Young Gu Xinghan did not fully understand the entire process.</p><p></p><p>He watched as many cultivators clad in strange attire arrived and witnessed many senior cultivators waking up.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the chaos, the ultimate outcome was positive.</p><p></p><p>He was deeply impressed by Liu San, the old man who had personally taught them in the beginning.</p><p></p><p>By the way, what did he teach them in the beginning?</p><p></p><p>Young Gu Xinghan couldn't help but enter a perplexed reverie.</p><p></p><p>This contemplative process continued throughout the sect's grand event.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he still couldn't figure it out.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, as all sect disciples were required to enter the Tianxuan Split Mirror and obtain their own Tianxuan Treasure Mirror, his attention shifted momentarily.</p><p></p><p>For Gu Xinghan, the Tianxuan Treasure Mirror, a priceless treasure with numerous functions, was far more intriguing than the jade disc.</p><p></p><p>Immersed in studying its various uses, he gradually forgot about the jade disc.</p><p></p><p>However, one day, when his friends began attempting the extraordinary feat of "building the Dao Foundation with fake Heaven and Earth," Gu Xinghan noticed something unusual.</p><p></p><p>When everyone else started trying, Gu Xinghan realized that he might, just might...</p><p></p><p>Have already built his Dao Foundation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xinghan felt somewhat lost for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Uncertain about the changes in his body, Gu Xinghan dared not ask anyone.</p><p></p><p>He just pondered slowly.</p><p></p><p>And in the course of his contemplation, the jade disc, which had remained motionless like an ordinary item...</p><p></p><p>Finally, it showed a reaction.</p>

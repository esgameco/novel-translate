        <h1>Chapter 970</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan, feeling the power he currently held, even with his experience and temperament, was momentarily overwhelmed with a sense of exhilaration. Although the difference between the Supreme Eternal Being and ordinary cultivators was like the difference between heaven and earth, when the number of ants reached a certain level, it was enough to make up for this gap! Just like at this moment, Li Fan, who had clashed his divine sense with the ancient method Longevity Ink Scholar Bin, was confident that after he could use all the divine senses of over a million cultivators for himself, he could easily crush this Law King of the Mysterious Heaven Sect. He even had a feeling that if he continued to expand further, after devouring the vast majority of cultivators in the Profound Yellow Realm... he might be able to confront and overcome the traditional teachings without defeat.</p><p></p><p>The inner desires, once nurtured, were hard to suppress. Especially the million imaginary demons and gods, who seemed to sense Li Fan's thoughts at this moment, all emitted whispers, trying to bewitch him. Under normal circumstances, hardly any cultivator could resist the temptation to ascend to heaven in one step. The inevitable outcome was losing their original intent, sinking endlessly in eternal expansion, until all cultivators perished. By then, no one knew whether the instigator would truly transcend into immortality or fall into extinction with the world together...</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan was different. First, he had the protection of the Profound Yellow Immortal Heart Spell, and secondly, besides the million demons and gods, he controlled many powers of equal caliber as them. He even had the existence of "True Ascension" above all. How could Li Fan abandon his original purpose and be lost in mind by a mere million demons and gods? Not to mention a million, even if tempted by tens of millions of demons and gods, or even the power of true immortals to give up "True Ascension," it was a fool's dream!</p><p></p><p>It could be said that "True Ascension" was Li Fan's greatest spiritual anchor, ensuring that he would never be tempted by external factors, nor forget his original intentions. Unless one day he encountered an existence stronger than "True Ascension"...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan's face was as cold as ancient ice, and the operation of the Dao Stone's power was pushed to its limit, desperately trying to control every demon and god. The manifestation of millions of thoughts had already placed a huge burden on the Medium-Grade Dao Stone. However, with the help of Li Fan's vast divine sense, he could barely maintain basic operation.</p><p></p><p>"If the quantity increases, they can only act based on instinct. Without my micro-manipulation, they are just mindless beasts, and their combat power will drop significantly. But it's enough to create chaos."</p><p></p><p>Within half a day, there was turmoil within the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, with most of the grassroots forces paralyzed. Each divine thought clone had the combat power equivalent to the weakest Divine Cultivator. Even in the central four states of the Immortals Alliance, the number of Divine Cultivators was not too many. Faced with the overwhelming attack of countless demons and gods, they could only choose to temporarily evade. </p><p></p><p>As for the Divine Cultivation realm, the choice remained unchanged. After all, one's own life was hard-earned after reaching the Unity Realm.</p><p></p><p>The common environment of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance led the cultivators to have almost the same thoughts. This also caused the hundred million demons and gods controlled by Li Fan to have a sense of being in a deserted place and seemed to be on the verge of completely taking down the thriving Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, at the Headquarters of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, in a boundless space where everything was pale.</p><p></p><p>As a lightning bolt exploded from the center of the space, one projection after another, resembling different worlds, was cast onto various corners of the space. The scenes were diverse, with continuous mountain ranges hidden under a sea of clouds, boundless bamboo forests full of greenery, solemn and majestic emperor's palaces, and even dreamy scenes of towering buildings amidst neon lights. Each world's projection seemed to have a blurry human face.</p><p></p><p>In this pale space.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang, tell us what the situation is now," a somewhat frivolous voice rang out from the world of boundless bamboo forests.</p><p></p><p>Then, one after another, projections of disasters wreaked by demons and gods on the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance consecutively appeared in the center of these world projections.</p><p></p><p>"Except for the core governing area of the Heavenly City in each state, basically all the regions have fallen," said a stern voice, introducing the current situation of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance to the present transmission practitioners.</p><p></p><p>These words came from the world of imperial palaces.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, so many divine creations... Could it be the lingering thoughts of the fallen cultivators of the Profound Yellow over these years?"</p><p></p><p>"Worthless beings. They can't even organize a decent counterattack!"</p><p></p><p>"I don't think they can't, it's that they don't want to. A group of unruly white-eyed wolves..."</p><p></p><p>The transmission practitioners uttered words one after another, all in a relaxed tone, showing no worry about the fall of the Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, all the transmission practitioners fell silent and looked towards a seemingly inconspicuous world.</p><p></p><p>There were no magnificent buildings, no awe-inspiring natural scenery, just nothingness.</p><p></p><p>A lonely figure sat in the midst of the void.</p><p></p><p>Jiang's gaze remained fixed on the multitude of images at the center of this place, ignoring the inquiries of the other transmission practitioners. Those transmission practitioners also seemed to hold a great deal of respect for the transmission practitioner Jiang, patiently waiting without a hint of dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, transmission practitioner Jiang spoke: "Behind these divine creations is only one person."</p><p></p><p>"Find him, and this matter can be resolved."</p><p></p><p>With these words, all the transmission practitioners showed signs of surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Such power... Even an ordinary Eternal Being can't do this, can they? Who lowered themselves to engage in such sneaky activities?"</p><p></p><p>"Wait a minute, as you say that, I seem to remember something. It seems that there was a manifestation of a certain technique in the Profound Yellow Realm back then, extremely similar to this."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the reactions of other transmission practitioners, transmission practitioner Jiang continued to analyze: "As you all said, at this level of power, they wouldn't perform meaningless actions. Releasing these million demons and gods..."</p><p></p><p>"It should only be a kind of deception. To disguise his true purpose."</p><p></p><p>"True purpose?" Transmission practitioner Jiang's deduction was widely accepted among the majority of transmission practitioners, and they began to ponder.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, many transmission practitioners showed subtle expressions on their faces. Their gazes swept over others in the room.</p><p></p><p>Without glancing at the others, transmission practitioner Jiang continued, "There's no need to doubt each other. At this level of power, what they desire can only be a few things."</p>

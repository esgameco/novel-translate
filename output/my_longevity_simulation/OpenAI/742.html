        <h1>Chapter 742</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Under the guidance of the omnipotent eye, Li Fan arrived at the testing site.</p><p></p><p>He saw the once ordinary-looking "Terminal Stone Disk" suspended above the heads of Fang Zaiji and two others. Around it, space seemed to be separated according to different rules, forming rings of different colors, each standing still. It looked quite marvelous.</p><p></p><p>A black aura, controlled by Jiang Yushan, was cutting around the outer rings of the terminal stone disc.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not disturb them but stood by observing.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he figured out the trick. Jiang Yushan's way of cutting was not to cut out a part of the stone disc but more like "peeling a layer of paper," cutting out a flat plane from the stone disc.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like she had done this before, as her movements appeared very skilled.</p><p></p><p>In no time, a thin "terminal stone piece" separated from the main body.</p><p></p><p>At the moment of separation, the stone piece, originally the size of a disc, began rapidly "shrinking."</p><p></p><p>The surrounding rings attached and its own volume were constantly decreasing.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry! Feed it!" Fang Zaiji promptly shouted.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he threw several stones towards Jiang Yushan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan focused and saw that they were the "Sword Embryo Elemental Stones" he had handed over to Fang Zaiji before!</p><p></p><p>When the elemental stones approached the terminal stone piece, they gradually melted like snow falling into water. The stone piece, however, slowed down its rate of shrinkage and stabilized.</p><p></p><p>After feeding it a total of six elemental stones, the circular space around the stone piece contracted and returned to the stone piece itself.</p><p></p><p>In this way, a miniature version of the "Terminal Stone Disk" was formed in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"That was damn difficult, even more challenging than delivering a child. Wouldn't you agree, Yushan," Fang Zaiji heaved a long sigh, holding the disc in his hand joyfully.</p><p></p><p>"Such blunt talk, can't you find a better comparison?" Liu San scolded with a furrowed brow.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Li Fan spoke: "Mr. Fang, have you discovered the specific usage of the terminal stone disk?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji proudly waved the disk in his hand and said, "Right. Thanks to those peculiar stones you gave me before..."</p><p></p><p>He went on to explain. It turned out that after a long period without understanding anything, Fang Zaiji finally decided to follow Li Fan's guidance and began cutting the terminal stone disk.</p><p></p><p>However, they found out that the part cut from the disk would almost instantly dissipate into the air. After trying various methods without success, an angry Fang Zaiji threw out everything useful he had in his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>By chance, he found a method that could stabilize the disk, which was to feed it with something that contained the "comprehension of the laws of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Not just Sword Embryo Elemental Stones, any treasure that condensed the comprehension of enlightenment had an effect.</p><p></p><p>The reason Fang Zaiji threw out only elemental stones was because they were more abundant. Treasures containing the comprehension of heaven and earth were extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>"This thing is like a cultivator. When it's born, it understands nothing. So, it doesn't show any abnormalities. But as long as you feed it with the comprehension of heaven and earth, help it 'grow up,' then its true abilities will show!" Fang Zaiji stroked the disc in his hand, speaking nostalgically.</p><p></p><p>"Just like you said, Master, this thing has no other uses, its only ability is to some extent, shield the perception of the Sky Xuan Mirror!"</p><p></p><p>Just as they talked, a disciple of the Medicine King Sect walked in.</p><p></p><p>He held a Sky Xuan Small Mirror in his hand, looking respectful.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Master!" He first saluted Li Fan, then greeted Elder Liu San and others.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recognized this person, named Meng Wushi, one of the first awakened cultivators of the Medicine King Sect. He had already obtained the status of a Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance cultivator and reached the Golden Core stage after switching to a new cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>"Show it to the Master!" Fang Zaiji ordered Meng Wushi.</p><p></p><p>Meng Wushi nodded, first took out a pile of high-grade spirit stones and placed them around the terminal disk. Then he activated the exchange function of the Sky Xuan Small Mirror.</p><p></p><p>A beam of light shot out from the mirror, first onto the spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to exchange?" The prompt of the Sky Xuan Mirror appeared.</p><p></p><p>Once Meng Wushi confirmed, the spirit stones vanished on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Then Meng Wushi placed the terminal disk within the range of the light.</p><p></p><p>But this time...</p><p></p><p>The Sky Xuan Mirror had no reaction at all.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it couldn't see the disk's existence at all!</p><p></p><p>"It was born from the Sky Xuan Mirror, but its only purpose after growing up is to counteract the Sky Xuan Mirror. Truly ironic!" Fang Zaiji said in agreement with his mouth, though his eyes revealed a deep sense of admiration.</p><p></p><p>"We have only tested with the Sky Xuan Small Mirror so far. I'm not sure if it will retain its shielding effect when we encounter the Sky Xuan Mirror shards in each state and the main body of the Sky Xuan Mirror. We need to examine further," Liu San added more seriously.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took the disc in his hands, observing it carefully for a moment. He found it very similar to the "Catastrophe Stones" created by the "Overturning Alliance" in the previous life.</p><p></p><p>"How many circular discs can this terminal stone disk cut?" This was a crucial question. If it could only generate a few, then it could only be worn by key figures. If it could produce continuously...</p><p></p><p>Facing Li Fan's question, Fang Zaiji replied very cautiously, "From the current situation, it seems that the terminal stone disk has not decreased due to our cutting. However, this could be because we have cut too few discs. We need to see for sure."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded and handed over the remaining more than one hundred Sword Embryo Elemental Stones to Fang Zaiji. He instructed Liu San, "Through Jiao Xiuyuan, purchase treasures that contain the comprehension of the laws of heaven and earth. With the contributions we have accumulated over the years, it should sustain the production of the discs for a while. This is beneficial. It will be very useful for us in the future..."</p><p></p><p>As if confirming Li Fan's words, golden characters suddenly appeared on the Sky Xuan Small Mirror in front of them.</p><p></p><p>"Due to special reasons, the functionality of the Sky Xuan Mirror is currently temporarily unavailable. Please try again later. We apologize for any inconvenience."</p><p></p><p>Liu San and the others were slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>They knew the Sky Xuan Mirror was a treasure of the immortal realm. Now, they were facing a situation where it couldn't be used...</p><p></p><p>They all turned their gaze towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Could this be the final transformation of the Sky Xuan Mirror?"</p><p></p><p>A glint passed through Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he felt a sense of crisis in his heart.</p>

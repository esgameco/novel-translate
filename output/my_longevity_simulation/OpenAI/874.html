        <h1>Chapter 874</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Despite the threefold restrictions, the faint sense of crisis that had always lingered in the heart gradually receded.</p><p></p><p>"…"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that it's not only the Xuanhuang realm that has encountered calamities."</p><p></p><p>"After the Divine Path was cut off, great disasters became widespread."</p><p></p><p>Easily sealing away this dangerous seal, Li Fan placed it within his own cave world to suppress it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then turned to Tianyang and asked, "How do you feel now?"</p><p></p><p>Tianyang flew over to Li Fan, sensing for a moment, then nodded, "That ant-like sensation has indeed weakened. However, it seems like it hasn't completely disappeared."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then bent down and touched the soil below with his hand.</p><p></p><p>The burning sting still came through, but his palm turned charred black in a moment.</p><p></p><p>Before the black spots spread further, Li Fan skillfully cut off his palm.</p><p></p><p>It fell to the ground, turning into ashes.</p><p></p><p>Even though the main culprit had been suppressed by Li Fan, the bizarre situation in the Yin-Yang Realm remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>"This is…"</p><p></p><p>"The cornerstone of the world's laws has been completely altered?"</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan felt a chill.</p><p></p><p>"If the Immortal Mortal Miasma is specifically aimed at cultivators, then this gray mold seems to be meant to infect the world."</p><p></p><p>"The current state of the Yin-Yang Realm seems to be a corpse of the world."</p><p></p><p>"What kind of person would be so insane to develop such a thing deliberately?"</p><p></p><p>A tinge of interest flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"In the 115th year, from the time at which the Immortal Alliance Exploration Team arrived, only a little over twenty years have passed. What could have happened for such ghostly soul bodies to be born in this dead place?"</p><p></p><p>"Well, no, that's not right."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>The conclusion drawn by the investigation team before was that the nourishment of countless soul bodies in the Yin-Yang Realm created the vast and immense group of Boundary-Crossing Whales in the Outer Realms.</p><p></p><p>But now, with no soul bodies appearing, where did those numerous Boundary-Crossing Whales they had seen before come from?</p><p></p><p>Clarifying this issue was not difficult.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Tianyang stayed in the Yin-Yang Realm for another three months.</p><p></p><p>Remaining hidden and patiently waiting.</p><p></p><p>It was all to determine whether the Boundary-Crossing Whales had a habit of "hunting" in this Yin-Yang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Their efforts paid off.</p><p></p><p>One day, just when Li Fan was getting a bit impatient, a few distant cries suddenly sounded.</p><p></p><p>Around ten Boundary-Crossing Whales arrived in the sky above the Yin-Yang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Compared to regular Boundary-Crossing Whales, they were generally larger in size.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly aware of the danger here, the Boundary-Crossing Whales did not act as recklessly in the Outer Realms, instead cautiously following some kind of pattern as they floated in the air. Heading towards a certain location in the Yin-Yang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Tianyang quietly followed.</p><p></p><p>At the edge of the Yin-Yang Realm, where the two had previously explored and found nothing unusual, the Boundary-Crossing Whales stopped.</p><p></p><p>With one experienced-looking Boundary-Crossing Whale leading the way, they aimed directly at a certain spot on the ground and rammed into it head-on.</p><p></p><p>The leading Boundary-Crossing Whale disappeared suddenly, and the others followed suit.</p><p></p><p>However, the area they could pass through seemed not particularly wide, and three out of the ten directly collided with the soil due to misjudgment of their positions.</p><p></p><p>There was no loud collision sound.</p><p></p><p>Only black spots quickly engulfed them, turning them into fragments of soil scattered on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan hesitated as he reached the spot where the Boundary-Crossing Whales vanished.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, let me go first," Tianyang volunteered.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded, and Tianyang flew in without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Instead of rushing in, Li Fan patiently waited outside the entrance.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Tianyang returned.</p><p></p><p>Even his originally taciturn face showed a rare look of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Through the images transmitted by Tianyang, Li Fan finally understood what was hidden inside.</p><p></p><p>Numerous soul bodies floated on the yellow river, old and young.</p><p></p><p>They were dressed in different clothing, but all had their eyes tightly shut, seemingly asleep.</p><p></p><p>Having soaked in the yellow river for who knows how long, these soul bodies had undergone eerie changes.</p><p></p><p>Their lower halves were no longer human-like, lacking legs and instead sprouting numerous roots that deeply embedded into the yellow river.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that this was a way to avoid being washed away by the river currents.</p><p></p><p>The Boundary-Crossing Whales that had sneaked in here acted as if they had entered a place of indulgence.</p><p></p><p>Excited, they feasted heartily.</p><p></p><p>With a single inhale, they swallowed thousands of soul bodies.</p><p></p><p>After consuming these soul bodies soaked in the yellow river, the transformation in the appearance of the Boundary-Crossing Whales was striking.</p><p></p><p>They almost instantly expanded, and it seemed like something was gestating within their bellies.</p><p></p><p>In the yellow river, countless soul bodies floated densely.</p><p></p><p>All seven Boundary-Crossing Whales were satiated, and the swallowed soul bodies were just a tiny fraction of the vast number.</p><p></p><p>Once they left satisfied, Li Fan used his colorful divine light to shield himself and entered the yellow river.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had seen numerous floating frozen corpses in the reversal of life and death array before.</p><p></p><p>Facing the tens of millions of human-like soul bodies floating in the river, Li Fan still felt somewhat horrified.</p><p></p><p>Especially the "roots" of these soul bodies' lower halves, some layered and entangled together.</p><p></p><p>Resulting in a large group of human faces, all closed-eyed, squeezed together at a place.</p><p></p><p>Like a round ball made up of numerous frightening faces.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, this place…"</p><p></p><p>Tianyang's transmission was also somewhat uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan swam through the yellow river, brushing past numerous soul bodies. Under the protection of the colorful divine light, apart from a little disgust, he felt no discomfort reaching a remarkable site.</p><p></p><p>This yellow river was much larger than the entire Yin-Yang Realm.</p><p></p><p>After searching it thoroughly, Li Fan vaguely understood the reason behind the strange occurrences in this place.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Dao of the Yin-Yang Realm has mutated due to the erosion of the gray mold."</p><p></p><p>"Fire as cold as ice, life as dead ashes."</p><p></p><p>"However, life seems to emerge here. It's just because this place was originally the 'death' location of the Yin-Yang Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan observed that as the yellow river flowed around, some inexplicable factors were washed together, gradually forming human-shaped molds.</p><p></p><p>As the water continued to rush, the soul bodies became clearer and clearer.</p><p></p><p>Forming complete and distinct human forms.</p><p></p><p>"If the normal world's Great Dao were in operation, this newly born soul might have been reincarnated into the mortal realm."</p><p></p><p>"But the Yin-Yang Realm itself is already dead, so the cycle of life and death no longer exists."</p><p></p><p>"For many years, these newly born souls have been continuously produced and accumulated here."</p>

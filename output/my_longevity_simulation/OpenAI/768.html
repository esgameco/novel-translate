        <h1>Chapter 768</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Though young, she must have been well protected by her tribe. Therefore, even if I can read minds, she doesn't seem to have much deceit at the moment," Li Fan contemplated in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Clearly only at the Golden Core level, yet she can sense what I am thinking..."</p><p></p><p>"It should not be due to cultivation methods. Perhaps it is related to her extraordinary foundation. Mind-reading ability is rare in the Profound Yellow Realm. To be able to ignore realm differences and achieve this point may already be in the realm of half-divine wonders," a mysterious glint passed through Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the cycle of reincarnation, besides the wonders of heaven like the 'Mingfa Jue' and the 'Sword,' Li Fan had also encountered many cultivators possessing half-divine wonders.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's daughter He Xingxing's 'Dao Wen Luo Pan,' Kong Youxian's 'Yin Yang Jade,' and Sun Qi's 'heaven and earth energy.'</p><p></p><p>But none of them were like the mind-reading wonder that Deng Mingsi possessed, which stirred something in Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>They say human hearts are inscrutable. This is especially true in the Profound Yellow Realm where one cannot be of the same cultivation level. No one can guarantee that companions who call you brother are not harboring ill intentions.</p><p></p><p>If one can master mind-reading abilities, even if only a few key moments, it can greatly reduce various risks encountered in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, it can also serve as a sort of gauge for power dynamics.</p><p></p><p>If one suddenly found their mind-reading ability ineffective, then they should know that the other person is someone they cannot afford to provoke.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, one can also deduce a way to prevent one's thoughts from being read."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had strong execution abilities, immediately returned to the Heavenly Mirror within the Tianquan City and began inquiring about Deng Mingsi's information.</p><p></p><p>The result surprised him - he didn't find any valuable information.</p><p></p><p>It was as if Deng Mingsi had appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan changed his approach and began searching for Deng Mingsi's elder brother, Qing Yu Ge, whom she had mentioned. At the same time, adding the arrogant and vengeful personality traits mentioned by Wang Wan.</p><p></p><p>Almost immediately, everything seemed to click.</p><p></p><p>However, Qing Yu Ge's background was not the Deng family but the Tianquan Wang family.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out he's an adopted son. However, the Wang family treats him as their own, even better than they treat the legitimate children of the Wang family."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's because of his sister." Li Fan nodded to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although the Tianquan Wang family was not considered the top aristocrats in the Immortal League, they were not to be offended by ordinary people. Many cultivators in the clan served in the mysterious Hall of Guardians.</p><p></p><p>It was said that the head of the Wang family bore the heavy responsibility of guarding the 'Mingfa Jue'...</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing this information, Li Fan had already made a decision in his mind.</p><p></p><p>To become friends with this Wang family for several lifetimes.</p><p></p><p>However, after searching for more information, Li Fan furrowed his brow slightly.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the Wang family's reputation was not only bad because of Qing Yu Ge.</p><p></p><p>All the young descendants of the Wang family, including the older generation, did not have a good reputation.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the Immortal League, there wasn't a single cultivator willing to speak up for them. Whenever the Tianquan Wang family was mentioned, people would spit in disdain.</p><p></p><p>"Utterly aloof, not exclusive. This is no longer about individual conduct but intentional behavior."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps to avoid suspicion."</p><p></p><p>Having once been in the official circles, Li Fan was no stranger to such methods.</p><p></p><p>"Mingfa Jue."</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Li Fan's search stopped there, and he did not delve into any more sensitive content.</p><p></p><p>Having already begun to be on guard against the Heavenly Mirror, Li Fan was naturally unwilling to continue his cultivation within it.</p><p></p><p>Now, the cultivators in the Immortal League were searching mountains and seas, looking for entrances to small worlds. It was no longer safe to dig secret chambers in the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"The hidden dangers on Liu San's side are yet to be resolved..."</p><p></p><p>For a moment, despite the vastness of the world, Li Fan found it difficult to even find a safe place for seclusion.</p><p></p><p>"This is just like the situation with the mysterious network from the previous life, the consequences of the strengthening of the Heavenly Mirror's power."</p><p></p><p>After weighing his options, Li Fan chose to rent a separate courtyard in the Tianquan City's Discussion Hall and set up multiple layers of formation as protection.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he feel a bit at ease.</p><p></p><p>"Although there haven't been any reckless actions, all my movements and plans still seem to be under my control. However, in this life, there is a faint feeling of struggling. This is the pressure of the great trend. With my strength and cultivation being low, I must go with the flow. If I resist the trend and make a slight mistake, I will be crushed to pieces."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I should consider 'Huanzhen'."</p><p></p><p>"But before that, there are a few things that must be done."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Let's take it step by step, first fully mastering the 'Wuji Yingxu Fa.'"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes, and the blue crystal in his mind, as if it were recalcitrant, faintly radiated a weak light. He painstakingly analyzed and processed the infused divine data.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Tianliang City.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai suddenly received a message from Liu San.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, good news. Among the new disciples that Lao Fang recently recruited, someone has successfully built their foundation!"</p><p></p><p>"What?" Xu Bai was momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>When it came to understanding the 'building of foundation by oneself,' with Yin Shang now dead, there were almost no cultivators in the world who could surpass him. The difficulty of building one's foundation was unfathomable. How could someone have succeeded in such a short time? Could it be that Liu San...</p><p></p><p>For a moment, various thoughts flashed through Xu Bai's mind. He fell silent suddenly.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Liu San's voice came slowly.</p><p></p><p>"But it's not using the 'building of foundation by oneself,' it's a young man named Jie Lin who, finding this method too difficult, came up with his own method of building his foundation using other objects between heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"At first, I didn't pay much attention to it. In the blink of an eye, he successfully built his foundation using a ten-thousand-year dormant dragon grass from Changsheng Valley."</p><p></p><p>"Heh, in that case, this Jie Lin can indeed be considered a remarkable talent. Since he has already successfully built his foundation, there's no need to push him further. Just take him out separately, so the real method of building the foundation doesn't spread among the disciples," Xu Bai's expression relaxed, instructing.</p><p></p><p>Liu San's laughter came from the other end: "Hehe, I've already done so. Such extraordinary talent, in ancient times, would have been recruited by the ten sects of immortality. How could it fall to our Medicine King Sect's lot? Truly, times have changed."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai instructed again: "You can use Jie Lin's successful foundation-building story as motivation for others. Who knows, it might inspire more geniuses."</p>

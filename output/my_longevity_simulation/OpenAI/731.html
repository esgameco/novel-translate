        <h1>Chapter 731</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the moment, the scene sensed by the clone through the "Zhu Xuan" secret method was described.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Yushan furrowed her brows and said, "With three clangs, this is already a warning from the highest level of existence in the Xuantian Sect. It seems that this Tianxuan Mirror is actually the Xuantian Realm from back then."</p><p></p><p>However, Liu San looked puzzled and said, "Just by swapping the words in the name, what's the significance? If it's to hide their origins, they could easily change to a completely unrelated name. Moreover, the mortal enemies of the Xuantian Sect and the ten sects of the Immortal Path have long since been wiped out, so there's no need to conceal their identities, right?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan shook her head and explained, "It's not as simple as just changing a name. I've heard that the Xuantian Treasure Mirror has a mysterious origin. It reflects all things in the world with supreme power. There were speculations within the ten sects of the Immortal Path back then that this mirror may not be a native item of the Xuanhuang Realm, but possibly originates from the immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze hardened.</p><p></p><p>As for Fang Zaiji, who was originally immersed in studying the "Endstone Disk", he suddenly looked up and gazed at Jiang Yushan, saying, "Immortal realm?!"</p><p></p><p>He exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan, composed, continued, "It's not something difficult to speculate about. The master of the Xuantian Sect, the half-step True Immortal, King Xuantian, did not have a treasure like a mirror on him before ascending. However, after returning from the path of ascension, he had this precious object with him. In the process of establishing the Xuantian Sect with the body of a semi-immortal in the Xuanhuang Realm, the Xuantian Treasure Mirror also played a crucial role. Otherwise, even after the Xuantian Sect's destruction, the ten sects of the Immortal Path wouldn't still extend their apprehension and concern towards it, even offering a seat of longevity as a reward."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, reaching the realm of True Immortal, their names themselves represent a certain power."</p><p></p><p>For some unknown reason, Jiang Yushan fell into a brief silence.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan timely asked, "Elder Jiang, what do you mean by this?"</p><p></p><p>"Before the end of the immortal path, there were many successful cultivators who transcended tribulations and ascended to become immortals in the history of the Xuanhuang Realm. Some of them were even elders of the ten sects of the Immortal Path. But when later generations wanted to trace and inquire about these true immortals..."</p><p></p><p>"...they found that all records related to them had disappeared."</p><p></p><p>"Not only were their deeds untraceable, but even their names couldn't be preserved."</p><p></p><p>"The nameless true immortals. Or rather, after completing the transformation into true immortals, they had become beings that we completely cannot comprehend."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this revelation, both Liu San and Fang Zaiji, these two mutual path cultivators, were stunned.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder, when I wandered the Xuanhuang Realm back then, I only heard about ancient immortals, but never knew the names of immortals," Fang Zaiji suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan continued, "True immortals are like this, and so are their treasures. Although treasures don't manifest as explicitly as true immortals and their names don't appear in the world, they must correspond to a certain rule of power. From 'Xuantian' to 'Tianxuan,' there must exist some unknown and miraculous changes."</p><p></p><p>After her words, the others were all struck by the power of true immortals rumored in the discussion, and for a while, silence enveloped the group.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, it was Fang Zaiji who reacted first, "If the Tianxuan Mirror is a treasure of a true immortal, then its secondary body is equivalent to half an immortal artifact, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>His face flushed red with excitement, and he tightly grasped the "Endstone Disk", disappearing in a flash.</p><p></p><p>"Master, rest assured, I will retreat for good research on it! If there's no result, I won't come out in this lifetime!"</p><p></p><p>His figure vanished, but his voice continued to echo.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly and then thanked Jiang Yushan, "Elder Jiang, you truly deserve to inherit the true teachings of the ten sects of the Immortal Path, your knowledge is broad and deep. Such mysteries of true immortals, I have never heard of before."</p><p></p><p>Liu San also sighed, "Our Medicine King Sect is already considered a medium sect. Yet, we know very little about such matters."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan seemed a bit dismissive, her voice sharp like metal friction, "It's just idle talk during leisure time. After all, the immortal path has been severed for a long time, and immortals, like the mythical legends in the mouths of mortals, are beyond reach."</p><p></p><p>She looked in the direction Fang Zaiji had disappeared and suddenly said, "I have to keep an eye on him. Otherwise, when he comes up with a result, it might be a hundred years later."</p><p></p><p>"Heh, not necessarily. Old Fang is more reliable..." Liu San was speaking, but he noticed Jiang Yushan had turned into a black streak and was leaving.</p><p></p><p>He got a bit anxious as well, "Yushan, wait for me!"</p><p></p><p>Without even bidding farewell to Li Fan, he chased after her.</p><p></p><p>In the scene, there was only Li Fan left.</p><p></p><p>"The nameless true immortals...‚Äù Paying no heed to the departure of the trio, Li Fan just pondered on Jiang Yushan's words, lost in thought for a moment.</p><p></p><p>After some time had passed, he snapped out of his reverie.</p><p></p><p>"The exploration of the White Mist is about to end, and the Tianxuan Mirror is about to complete its transformation..."</p><p></p><p>"Now that the Wanxian Alliance is going through a crucial period of change, it's not suitable to go out. It's better to wait for the changes to come within the Longevity Valley."</p><p></p><p>"The restrictions on entering the Meteoric Immortal Realm have long been lifted, but as they were exploring in the Abyss before, there was no time to re-enter."</p><p></p><p>"It's a good opportunity to revisit the Heavenly Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>After contemplation, Li Fan made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>However, before entering the Meteoric Immortal Realm, he silently wandered through the Longevity Valley and the Beastkind Realm.</p><p></p><p>Most disciples of the Medicine King Sect who had awakened were already out of the Longevity Valley. Only key positions had disciples on guard.</p><p></p><p>In the Beastkind Realm, Li Fan saw a few familiar figures.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than Liaojie Xiaofan, Suzhong Yu, Suzhao Meier, and others.</p><p></p><p>Without them knowing, Li Fan's divine sense swept over them, and he discovered something strange.</p><p></p><p>Although he hadn't paid much attention to them in this life, after all, he had imparted cultivation methods to them and didn't impose many restrictions on them.</p><p></p><p>Now, more than ten years had passed, according to the talents they had shown in the previous lives, they should have broken through to the Foundation Establishment realm at least.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>Their progress seemed a bit underwhelming.</p><p></p><p>Among them, Yefei Peng, who cultivated the Triple Cultivation of techniques, body refinement, and the Beast Soul Beads, had the highest realm, but was just in the early stage of Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>Suzhao Meier and Suzhong Yu were still in the Qi Refinement stage after breaking through the Foundation Establishment stage not long ago. The rare treasures of heaven and earth were all provided by the Medicine King Sect. With three years of selling Longevity Pills, the Medicine King Sect's sect treasury was growing richer by the day.</p><p></p><p>As for Xiaoheng  Xiaoheng, who had not chosen a cultivation method and opted to communicate with the Imperial Beast Soul Beads, he had completely given up. He had lost his drive.</p><p></p><p>He spent his days showing off in the form of the Beast God Armor in the Beastkind Realm, asserting dominance.</p><p></p><p>"Although their cultivation speeds are still faster than mine, it's clearly not at their expected level."</p><p></p><p>"Is there a gradual loss of spiritual energy..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>"Originally, I thought that the things inside this fishing pond were put in a thousand years ago when the forging was completed."</p><p></p><p>"But the thing I fished up last time was definitely not created back then."</p><p></p><p>"It is something that appeared within the last five hundred years."</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet fisherman opened his palm, and a black jade piece bent like a horn appeared.</p><p></p><p>"What is this..." Li Fan couldn't recognize it.</p><p></p><p>"'Heaven Conquest Horn.' An invention of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance. When blown, it can temporarily activate the power of the celestial laws in a province," the stone tablet fisherman explained concisely.</p><p></p><p>"Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance?" Li Fan first froze, then his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Turning to look at the fishing pond, thoughts rushed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Do you understand now? The things inside this fishing pond are not static. It will replenish with new items from the outside, not only from the Xuanhuang Realm but even from other immortal cultivation realms."</p><p></p><p>"While we are fishing in the starry sky, it is also fishing in the heavens..."</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet fisherman's words confirmed Li Fan's speculations.</p><p></p><p>Like a towering tidal wave, it left his mind unable to calm down for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had personally experienced the wonders of the fishing pond, he had not expected them to be so profound.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the power of immortal artifacts."</p><p></p><p>"Not only does it contain countless treasures, but one doesn't have to worry about exhausting them."</p><p></p><p>This was what Li Fan thought.</p><p></p><p>However, what the stone tablet fisherman cared about was different. "This is the true way of 'fishing.'"</p><p></p><p>"This immortal artifact is extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>"If I can master it, maybe without relying on it, I can fish in the heavens and find what I want." The stone tablet fisherman's voice carried some excitement.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan fell silent involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>Only now did he realize.</p><p></p><p>A miraculous item like the Creation Stone Tablet, how could it possibly choose an ordinary person for its host?</p><p></p><p>With the discovery of the stone tablet fisherman, he stopped fishing.</p><p></p><p>Simultaneously, his appearance changed.</p><p></p><p>No longer resembling a fisherman but a newborn baby who had just been born.</p><p></p><p>He fell asleep by the edge of the pond with his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a few more days without any signs of waking up, Li Fan shook his head and left.</p><p></p><p>"Even with the insight of the Stone Tablet Senior, understanding the way of fishing may not be a matter of a moment."</p><p></p><p>"But he has occupied the fishing pond making it impossible for anyone to disturb." Li Fan felt helpless.</p><p></p><p>He had to instruct Ling Ling to wait there and contact him if there was any movement.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then returned to the Spirit Wood Realm alone.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, he received information from the Five Elders' Association.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out even the contacts of the Five Elders' Association were fake."</p><p></p><p>"This Stone Tablet Senior really got into character," recalling the tone and expression of the other party, Li Fan shook his head inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, he has a good temper. He doesn't immediately try to kill me at the slightest disagreement."</p><p></p><p>In these few days following the Stone Tablet Senior, besides learning some ancient secrets.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing was to clarify the essence of the conflict between the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders' Association in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the sighs of the other party, Li Fan thought, "The Xuanhuang Realm is like a ship that is about to sink."</p><p></p><p>"The Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders' Association are vying for the ultimate control of the ship."</p><p></p><p>"They both have absolute confidence that they can liberate the Xuanhuang Realm from its sinking fate. But the premise is that there must be a final ruler determined."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it's just like the Ten Sects of the Immortal Dao several years ago."</p><p></p><p>"It's not that they have been blinded by power, it's just that if they want to escape, they must coordinate and concentrate the power of the entire realm. If anyone plays double-dealing tricks..."</p><p></p><p>"So, fighting among themselves is not a problem. Once it truly threatens the existence of the Xuanhuang Realm, both sides will join hands. Just like the return of those traitors five hundred years ago."</p><p></p><p>When mentioning those traitors from five hundred years ago, the tone of the stone tablet fisherman also became uncommonly fierce.</p><p></p><p>"Five hundred years ago should refer to the counterattack from the small worlds. However, these small worlds seem to be just puppets. The real mastermind should be the cultivators who had previously betrayed the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>In the Spirit Wood Realm, by corroborating the stone tablet fisherman's words with the previously obtained information, Li Fan seemed to be thinking deeply.</p><p></p><p>"To know more, it all depends on their whims."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, it would require continuous interrogation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts shifted slowly.</p><p></p><p>From the perspective of the Stone Tablet Senior, many things that Li Fan couldn't see clearly and seemed to be shrouded in mist became clear.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the Stone Tablet Senior's discourse on the rivalry between the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders' Association.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but ask, "And what about the Supreme Law Transmitter? What is his attitude toward all this?"</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet fisherman seemed to have heard an extremely funny joke.</p><p></p><p>He burst into laughter unabashedly.</p><p></p><p>Then he answered, "Law Transmitter?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if Xuanhuang sinks..."</p><p></p><p>"But doesn't the Law Transmitter fly?"</p><p></p><p>"He's not bothered at all."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet fisherman's smile suddenly faded.</p><p></p><p>"That's just my speculation."</p><p></p><p>"In reality, for the Supreme Law Transmitter, who considers Xuanhuang Realm his private possession. His attitude is also somewhat unpredictable."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, over these years, he could have left long ago."</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet fisherman's voice gradually weakened until it was barely audible.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The Law Transmitter flies."</p><p></p><p>"It seems she can already ignore the influence of the Immortal Ruins and leave on her own."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder, what level of power is needed to escape from Xuanhuang?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an idea popped into Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Although in the Xuanhuang Realm, besides the Supreme Law Transmitter, there had been no precedents of a Longevity Realm individual escaping.</p><p></p><p>But Xuanhuang's longevity was intertwined with the world.</p><p></p><p>It is possible that it was not due to their lack of power, but because of the counteraction caused by the bonds.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Stone Tablet Senior.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, it doesn't necessarily have to rely solely on one's own power. External forces can also be used."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remembered the countless towering spires standing on the ground of Xuanhuang during the 114th era.</p><p></p><p>"I achieved the Infant stage with the Five Elements Origin Cave. If I unify the Five Elements and create a new world through fusion."</p><p></p><p>"Then build spires on the ground to use thrust..."</p><p></p><p>"There might be a possibility of escaping the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>In fact, with his 'Realization' ability, Li Fan had no intention of stubbornly confronting the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>If there was a chance, finding another cultivation realm would definitely be much better than staying in this eerie place.</p><p></p><p>After all, for the sinking Xuanhuang Realm, anything was possible.</p><p></p><p>Having encountered too many monsters along the way, Li Fan thought, "One attempt, two-pronged approach."</p>

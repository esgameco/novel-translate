        <h1>Chapter 727</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>At that moment, a new boat was summoned, and Dongfang Yao, who was still immersed in sorrow, was pulled into it.</p><p></p><p>Then, the Mirror of Heavens was released.</p><p></p><p>After the synchronization of the exploration records just lost in the domain of consciousness, seeing his slightly over 100,000 Qingxuan Points and the "Final Stone Tablet" that had not been exchanged yet, Li Fan directly chose to exchange them.</p><p></p><p>The Qingxuan Points he had accumulated for a long time disappeared instantly.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a faint white light, a heavy gray circular disk appeared in Li Fan's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Final Stone Tablet?"</p><p></p><p>About the size of a palm, Li Fan held it in his hand, shaking it and studying it for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, just like its name, it was no different from an ordinary stone. Neither his consciousness nor spiritual power could produce any response with it.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how Fufaize discovered its usage in the last life."</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan also knew that this matter couldn't be rushed. There was still plenty of time in this lifetime to slowly unravel this issue. He put it away for now, then took out the items left by Huangfu Song and laid them out in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the Mirror of Heavens and the Dissociation Disc, there were also two storage rings.</p><p></p><p>"Dongfang, do you know if Huangfu had any other close ones still alive?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao's mind calmed slightly, shaking his head, "Just like me, all lone rangers with no attachments."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Fan frowned, "Then what about these items?"</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao glanced once and decided, "Huangfu's legacy items were retrieved at great risk by you, Li Xiong, so you should keep them for now. When we find Huangfu's reincarnation in the future, we'll hand them over to him."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed lightly, "I guess that's the only way. The Xuanyellow Realm is so vast, and who knows where Huangfu will reincarnate in eighteen years. If he ends up reincarnating within the Immortal Alliance domain, it's manageable. It'll just take some effort to find him. I'm concerned if he reincarnates on the side of the Five Eldersâ€¦"</p><p></p><p>"There must be some fancy gadgets in the Netherworld Hall that can track the approximate location of a true spirit's reincarnation. Since Brother Huangfu has passed away, I don't want to explore anything else again. When we return, I'll look into this matter. I must find Brother Huangfu as soon as possible," Dongfang Yao said in a solemn tone.</p><p></p><p>"I'll ask around too. Maybe Shuofeng Xiong might know," Li Fan suggested.</p><p></p><p>Next, the two of them returned from the white mist depths.</p><p></p><p>They first arrived at the Heavenly Yu Prefecture's Universal Shrine and informed them of the unfortunate news of Huangfu Song's demise.</p><p></p><p>The receiving cultivator, Li Fan, who they encountered, was the slim figure Shangguan Shi, whom Li Fan had met before.</p><p></p><p>After many years of being colleagues, Shangguan Shi sighed when he heard the news, "I'll inform Chief Ji about this matter. Thank you, both!"</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao felt a bit ashamed and self-consciously excused himself, respectfully bidding goodbye before leaving hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>Once out of the Universal Shrine, he also bid farewell to Li Fan and left a communication talisman before going to investigate information related to the Netherworld Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Dongfang Yao is quite an individual," Li Fan watched as the figure gradually disappeared and pondered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Instead of returning to Changsheng Valley, he headed straight to the Heavenly Rights City.</p><p></p><p>During his exploration of the white mist, Shuofeng had sent several messages asking for a battle.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan politely refused each time, citing being deeply trapped in the white mist and unable to break free. Despite Shuofeng not saying much on the surface, after repeatedly refusing, there seemed to be a subtle change in his attitude.</p><p></p><p>So, as soon as Li Fan had some free time, he contacted him. After all, his status as a guest of the Xuan Family still had some usefulness for now. A little competition would help maintain his position as a guest, which wasn't a troublesome matter.</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng was currently at the Heavenly Rights City Branch.</p><p></p><p>This place, compliments of his mother, Fei Xue Xianzun, though smaller in size than the Shuofeng Mountain outside, was worth more than ten times its price.</p><p></p><p>Without a certain contribution level and specific channels, it was impossible to purchase it.</p><p></p><p>Entering the central cave area of the Heavenly Rights City, they could see the towering Political Hall core position in the city, and a woman in a red dress was already waiting outside.</p><p></p><p>However, she was not the previous one in a yellow dress, but had a different appearance.</p><p></p><p>Remaining composed, Li Fan followed the woman in the red dress and entered the branch.</p><p></p><p>"It's so boring! With the Netherworld Hall now, where all cultivators can be resurrected, my mother still has many restrictions on me," Shuofeng's somewhat annoyed voice could be heard from a distance.</p><p></p><p>The woman in the red dress showed no emotions on her face, as if she hadn't heard Shuofeng's complaints at all. She led Li Fan inside before giving a courtesy and then left on her own.</p><p></p><p>"Ha, Li Xiong, long time no see!"</p><p></p><p>Sensing Li Fan's presence, Shuofeng was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>However, what greeted Li Fan wasn't a warm hug, but a white sword light!</p><p></p><p>With a flash in his eyes, Li Fan generated a blue water sword in front of him, blocking it.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Amidst the explosion, Li Fan said loudly, "Congratulations, Shuoxiong, for solving the problem of being unable to attack first."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that my 'Thousand Threads' Divine Ability is no longer a match for Shuoxiong," Li Fan flew to Shuofeng with a slight change in his eyes after seeing the situation in the field.</p><p></p><p>Shuofeng was still in simple clothing, but there was a green leaf flying knife hanging above his head.</p><p></p><p>The tip of the knife wasn't directed at Li Fan, but precisely aimed at Shuofeng's head below!</p><p></p><p>"Ha, Li Xiong, how about my method? Since the sword isn't willing to make the first move, I'll force it. With the flying blade hanging over my head, my life is on the line. It and I merge into one; when threatened, it will instinctively counterattack. Then, I control the sword light it produces to defend against enemies," Shuofeng glanced at the flying blade over his head, speaking somewhat proudly.</p><p></p><p>"Being able to come up with such a brilliant method, Shuoxiong is indeed a talent," Li Fan flattered him.</p><p></p><p>He then looked at another cultivator sitting beside Shuofeng.</p><p></p><p>With sword-like eyebrows and starry eyes, he had a remarkable presence. Though not on par with the peerless beauty of Xubai, there was still some gap. But he could be considered one of the top talents among people.</p><p></p><p>This was Dantai Tao, the formation genius who had passed away due to unforeseen circumstances during the array training in the last life, now still alive in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>"Who is this?" Li Fan asked Shuofeng, knowing the answer but still asking.</p><p></p><p>"Dantai Xiong is a rare genius in the current world of formations; you should get to know him," Shuofeng briefly introduced Dantai Tao to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Pleased to meet you!" Dantai Tao looked at Li Fan with a gentle expression, greeting him.</p><p></p><p>After some pleasantries, the three of them started discussing topics related to the Netherworld Hall.</p>

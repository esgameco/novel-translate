        <h1>Chapter 858</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Haha, great." At this moment, Ji Shaoli also seemed to have lifted a heavy burden, instantly retracting all the magical treasures protecting him, looking completely defenseless.</p><p></p><p>This made Zhong Shentong even more certain that there must be a certain restrictive force within the oath of initiation.</p><p></p><p>"Now that Senior Zhong has joined, why not have Little Liuli follow along as well," Ji Shaoli smiled.</p><p></p><p>Although it was a suggestion, the tone did not allow for refusal.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong, feeling helpless, could only gesture for Liuli to comply.</p><p></p><p>Without the need for any special vocal transmission.</p><p></p><p>Just by hearing Zhong Shentong recite it once, Liuli had already memorized everything.</p><p></p><p>She repeated it perfectly, not missing a single word.</p><p></p><p>And watching the other complete the initiation oath, still appearing carefree and unfazed, without feeling any pressure.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong couldn't help but sigh inwardly, "Truly fearless as a newborn calf. Young child, unaware of the wonders of true immortals."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhong Shentong deep in thought, Ji Shaoli spoke up, "Senior Zhong, do not worry. I have already contacted headquarters. The fishing pond here will still be under your supervision."</p><p></p><p>"Everything will remain the same."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhong Shentong was greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"In addition, we will not do any cover-ups here. After all, only treasures need to be concealed. Why bother guarding an ordinary small pond? However, outside your mountain temple, you can set up formations to prevent such incidents of being surveilled by outsiders from occurring again," Ji Shaoli said in a relaxed tone.</p><p></p><p>"If there is a breach, we can quickly come to support."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's detailed explanation dispelled most of Zhong Shentong's doubts.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I have been a bit overly cautious. The Myriad Realms United Association truly lives up to its reputation," he thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>With the help of Lin Ling, the defensive formation outside the temple was quickly established.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli then wanted to take out some magical treasures to protect Zhong Shentong.</p><p></p><p>This made Zhong Shentong, who hadn't felt cared for in a long time, feel a little embarrassed instead.</p><p></p><p>"These things are unnecessary. I have accumulated too many random things over the years," he shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"When a real crisis comes, they are of no use."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, he threw a storage ring over.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, take a look inside. Are there any items I overlooked?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli scanned through the storage ring full of cluttered items like a junkyard.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he shook his head, "Not worth much."</p><p></p><p>"However..." Ji Shaoli paused slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Some items, although of low quality, may have additional value. After all, most of these are items from other immortal realms. From what I know, some cultivators are very interested in similar items."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong nodded slightly, "I understand the reasoning. But to avoid drawing attention, I have simply given up on selling them."</p><p></p><p>"Now, you don't have to worry about that anymore," Ji Shaoli put away the storage ring.</p><p></p><p>"We will have someone handle these items. When the time comes, half of the profits will be handed over to the association, and the other half will be returned to you."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong had no objections to the distribution and even sighed, "Having a backup is indeed stronger than fighting alone."</p><p></p><p>"The fishing pond is an extremely rare treasure. Within the association, we will also take strict measures to keep it confidential. Only occasionally will people come to fish here, and it will not be very frequent," Ji Shaoli briefed Zhong Shentong on future arrangements.</p><p></p><p>These measures made him even more at ease.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ji Shaoli sought advice from him on the experience of fishing in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is the 'thoughts as bait' concept?"</p><p></p><p>"Do all thoughts work?"</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Zhong Shentong explained, "The fishing pond doesn't have any usage instructions, so everything has to be figured out by myself."</p><p></p><p>"Based on my experience over the years, the 'thoughts as bait' principle generally follows the law of like attracts like."</p><p></p><p>"In the fishing pond, there are countless light clusters, each with different attributes. Light clusters similar to the bait created by your intention are more likely to be caught."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong took out the Mixed Element Purple Golden Gourd again, saying, "For example, this gourd is a fragment of a similarly gourd-shaped offensive magical treasure that I had once visualized and luckily caught."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli pondered thoughtfully, "If we consider those light clusters to have their consciousness, does it mean that they will be attracted by thoughts as bait that are similar or interesting to them?"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Although that's the case, luck still plays a role," Zhong Shentong said with a furrowed brow.</p><p></p><p>"The starry sky in the fishing pond is too vast. The range each thought bait can influence is only a small portion. The fishing line needs to touch a light cluster that can be attracted..."</p><p></p><p>"Difficult, difficult, difficult!" Zhong Shentong repeated 'difficult' three times, showing his helplessness.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli also agreed with a nod.</p><p></p><p>Their conversation was carried out through telepathy, unbeknownst to Liuli and Lin Ling who were nearby.</p><p></p><p>However, within this short period, their relationship had quickly warmed up.</p><p></p><p>They were no longer glaring at each other but playing together.</p><p></p><p>Watching this scene, Zhong Shentong sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>"I see this young lady..."</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Zhong Shentong did not address Lin Ling as 'Senior.'</p><p></p><p>"This girl named Lin Ling seems to be quite young?" he asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli nodded, "She's only a little over ten years old, inexperienced in the ways of the world, so she still has a childlike nature."</p><p></p><p>This statement completely stumped Zhong Shentong.</p><p></p><p>"Over ten years old? A prodigy?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, don't be surprised, Friend. Inside our association, there are numerous unrivaled geniuses. This level..."</p><p></p><p>"Is nothing special."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli mysteriously smiled, offering a simple explanation.</p><p></p><p>In shock, Zhong Shentong was lost in his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli once again attempted fishing.</p><p></p><p>With a calm mind, he entered the endless and dazzling starry sky.</p><p></p><p>"Thoughts as bait..."</p><p></p><p>He tried to concentrate his intention into bait.</p><p></p><p>As expected, it failed.</p><p></p><p>However, this time he was lucky to catch a blue light cluster.</p><p></p><p>It didn't seem to have a specific use, appearing to be a fragment of some magical treasure.</p><p></p><p>After a fruitless study, Ji Shaoli temporarily put it away.</p><p></p><p>For the next period of time, he stayed in the temple, diligently practicing every day.</p><p></p><p>As he became more familiar with Zhong Shentong and his disciple, with their guidance, his progress rapidly advanced.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli finally successfully condensed a thought bait for the first time.</p>

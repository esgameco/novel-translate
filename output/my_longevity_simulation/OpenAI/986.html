        <h1>Chapter 986</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Indeed, it is filled with dangers. Years ago, we survivors of various realms had conflicts with the mysterious yellow realm. Now that I am alone and returning to the same place, I must be more cautious." Daoist Baihua explained.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? There were conflicts back then? How did it happen? When calamity strikes, shouldn't we cultivators unite and face it together?" Li Fan pondered for a moment and understood the possible reasons for the conflicts.</p><p></p><p>A group of displaced individuals encountering a prosperous immortal realm like the mysterious yellow realm would certainly give rise to various covetous desires. At that time, with Xuantian Wang still in power, he would definitely have kept such ambitious individuals out.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan knew it was a rhetorical question.</p><p></p><p>The explanation given by Daoist Baihua was consistent with Li Fan's speculation: "That half-immortal is truly domineering. He directly rejected our proposal to unite and face the calamity together. He even wanted to expel us on the spot."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, naturally, some of us were unhappy with that. So we ended up having a showdown with each other..."</p><p></p><p>Daoist Baihua's figure shimmered with golden light, indicating that the showdown she mentioned was not just a simple friendly competition.</p><p></p><p>"Truly befitting of a half-immortal who has been bathed in spiritual energy, even if not fully ascended, their strength is enough to overpower ordinary cultivators. Knowing we were no match, we had to retreat. And that half-immortal did show some semblance of a celestial being, setting aside grievances, and even gave us quite a few resources before our departure..." Daoist Baihua sighed. </p><p></p><p>"It seems that Xuantian Wang, while caring for the people of the mysterious yellow realm, is not a foolishly kind person. He is still wary, especially towards outsiders, particularly those in times of calamities. However, he is still somewhat too lenient. If it were me, I would have surely slaughtered all those individuals and plundered all their resources. In the apocalypse, every resource gained equals a sliver of hope for survival. By letting the tiger return to the mountain, there is a greater chance of future dangers..." In a flash, various thoughts crossed Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Although he concealed his murderous intent well, it did not escape Daoist Baihua's sensing with her glass-like body.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Baihua paused slightly as she didn't understand where the sudden murderous intent came from.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this person in front of me has a connection with the half-immortal from back then?" Daoist Baihua was shocked in her heart.</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation, Daoist Baihua voluntarily shifted the topic from past events to the disappearance of the fishing pond: "After I arrived in the mysterious yellow realm, I still attached myself to the little glass. One, because I sensed that the mysterious yellow realm seemed much more dangerous than before, and two, because the insights from the glass's wisdom fruit were greatly beneficial to my cultivation..."</p><p></p><p>"The days were relatively peaceful until the arrival of fellow Daoists and the stone tablet cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"If it were merely fishing for treasures in the fishing pond, it would've been fine, but he insisted on comprehending the Way of Fishing..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Daoist Baihua glanced at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet's decision was not unrelated to Li Fan's instigation.</p><p></p><p>"The precious treasure 'Fishing Pond' was apparently crafted by a 'Nameless True Immortal' who has established his own path. How could others intrude upon his path?"</p><p></p><p>"The stone tablet's desire to understand the Way of Fishing would undoubtedly face retribution. As for where the stone tablet and the fishing pond have gone, it's probably beyond our comprehension." Daoist Baihua shook her head, sighing slightly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Baihua's explanation had no loopholes. Li Fan questioned himself, if someone wanted to comprehend the Way of True Immortality and manipulate space-time, then Li Fan would undoubtedly have to finish them off.</p><p></p><p>But soon, Li Fan thought of something else and furrowed his brows slightly: "Since the Way of True Immortality does not tolerate outside interference, why did the 'Inscription Dao Immortal' leave behind several True Immortal inscriptions? How could the Way of True Immortality not catch the attention of the Inscription Dao Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Daoist Baihua seemingly organized her thoughts: "Perhaps the friend misunderstood. The path of the Inscription Dao Immortal has no fundamental connection to the Way of True Immortality."</p><p></p><p>"The Inscription Dao Immortal's path is about inscribing characters. Whereas the Way of True Immortality revolves around the character 'hunger'..."</p><p></p><p>"He might be seeking the path of 'hunger' itself or something related to 'hunger.' But it wouldn't be the 'Inscription Dao.'" </p><p></p><p>"Do you understand what I'm saying?" Daoist Baihua looked at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After contemplating for a moment, Li Fan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he couldn't grasp such a simple concept, but a sudden idea sprouted in his mind, prompting him to confirm with Daoist Baihua. </p><p></p><p>"I've seen that the stone tablet was bound by chains, originally thought to be a suppression by outsiders."</p><p></p><p>"But now, it's more likely self-restraint by the immortal. Perhaps to prevent losing control due to comprehending the character 'hunger.' No, as the immortals are indifferent to mortal lives, it's unlikely they would just cause innocent harm. It's more probable they are worried about the impact of losing control on their own path..."</p><p></p><p>"So, his path of cultivation might be related to 'resisting instinctual hunger.'"</p><p></p><p>Empathy was something Li Fan possessed, and in an instant, he deduced many thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan immersed in deep thought, Daoist Baihua remained silent as well.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Li Fan spoke again, "Although the friend has explained many things, there is still no concrete evidence. We can't leave any stone unturned in case of adversity for the people of the mysterious yellow realm. I'm afraid we still need to trouble the friend..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's reaction seemed to be within Daoist Baihua's expectations. She remained calm and said, "What if I am also a cultivator of the mysterious yellow realm now?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was startled, "What do you mean by that, friend?"</p><p></p><p>"I borrowed the glass body to reshape it. And the glass is within the mysterious yellow realm, taking form using the power of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>"In a sense, I am nurtured by the heaven and earth of the mysterious yellow realm." Daoist Baihua smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>"If the friend doesn't believe it, you can return with me to the mysterious yellow realm and feel the sentiment of the heaven and earth. With my current strength, as an outsider, the heaven and earth would definitely show inherent disgust. Cultivators from the mortal realm can instantly see that I cannot hide my true identity."</p><p></p><p>To corroborate her words, Li Fan took Daoist Baihua back to the original mysterious yellow realm.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, he shifted to a heavenly view.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Li Fan could see that the heaven and earth held no malice toward Daoist Baihua.</p><p></p><p>There was even a hint of intimacy and recruitment implied.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but feel baffled.</p><p></p><p>"What level is the friend's cultivation now?" he asked.</p><p></p><p>"Well, in the Wan Sheng realm, after my techniques have matured and I've transformed into glass, the next step would be to undergo the Heavenly Tribulation and ascend to immortality."</p><p></p><p>"Although the path to immortality is blocked for me, and I cannot ascend, my realm has remained stagnant. But over the years, my strength has continued to increase, especially after absorbing the wisdom fruit of the glass..."</p><p></p><p>--- translated by Supertext.AI ---</p>

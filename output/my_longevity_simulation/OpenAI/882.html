        <h1>Chapter 882</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan only felt as if his soul was momentarily immersed in magma. </p><p></p><p>The extreme heat seemed to completely consume his soul. </p><p></p><p>Enveloped in endless brightness, Li Fan felt his own soul dissolving, disappearing at a terrifying speed. </p><p></p><p>However, in contrast, the burned soul, transformed into a mysterious nutrient. </p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Grand Heaven trembled slightly, and then a layer of blood-colored radiance appeared in various heavenly worlds. </p><p></p><p>The scenes illuminated by the Five Elements were bizarre and beautiful. </p><p></p><p>Under this blood glow, many strange phenomena were born in the heavenly vault. </p><p></p><p>What was even more terrifying was that within the heavenly vault, the circulation of the Five Elements' power suddenly accelerated to nearly double the speed. And this violent catalytic effect had no limit, further causing Li Fan's soul to burn rapidly! </p><p></p><p>A sense of deadly crisis surged in his heart. Li Fan understood that if he didn't return his soul before it was completely incinerated, then he would truly be dead! </p><p></p><p>Suppressing the impulse to return his soul, Li Fan silently activated the Endless Balance Technique. </p><p></p><p>An invisible vortex appeared at the intersection of the Five Elements' heavenly vault. A large amount of violent Five Element power was evenly drawn in. </p><p></p><p>The unity of the Five Elements. In nothingness, the power of balance emerged. </p><p></p><p>Originally like a seafloor exposed after the tide receded. In an instant, a surging sea swept back. </p><p></p><p>The part of Li Fan's soul that had already disappeared, nourished by the power of balance, unexpectedly returned! </p><p></p><p>Although it was quickly incinerated by the "Soul Burning" secret technique, the power of balance between the Five Elements was continuous, making this part of the soul, like wild grass, impossible to burn completely! </p><p></p><p>Due to the effect of the "Soul Burning" secret technique, at this moment, Li Fan's appearance was also shrouded in a layer of blood glow. </p><p></p><p>Appearing extremely fierce, it was frightening. </p><p></p><p>After a while, Li Fan gradually adapted to the constantly changing soul under the states of Soul Burning and Balance. </p><p></p><p>After checking, not only did the power that could be called upon nearly double, even his thought process became more active. </p><p></p><p>The amplification brought by burning the soul was comprehensive! </p><p></p><p>"This is just burning the outer part of the soul. If I continue to use the more concentrated and pure central part of the soul as fuel..." </p><p></p><p>"The amplification effect will double again!" </p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes, sensing for a moment. </p><p></p><p>"With the restorative speed of my current Endless Balance Technique, I can maintain the initial state of soul burning permanently." </p><p></p><p>"If I maintain mid-level soul burning for a long time, it may cause some damage to the soul. It will require some time for slow recovery afterward." </p><p></p><p>"The ultimate soul burning..." </p><p></p><p>"Is unnecessary." </p><p></p><p>With his expanded strength, Li Fan immediately felt like he wanted to fight again. </p><p></p><p>With a thought, Tianyang appeared in front of him, full of combat intentions. </p><p></p><p>Through the new Yin and Yang Realm entrance, Li Fan and Tianyang appeared once again in the open void corridor. </p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Tianyang attacked first. </p><p></p><p>Ever since his defeat at the hands of his senior brother, he had been thinking of regaining victory. </p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Li Fan had always been avoiding a direct confrontation. </p><p></p><p>Now that he finally saw an opportunity, Tianyang also noticed his senior brother's significant progress in strength. </p><p></p><p>Therefore, he gave it his all from the start. </p><p></p><p>Controlling the space around Li Fan's body, he attempted to shatter his body with force. </p><p></p><p>However, to his surprise, the very effective method from their last encounter had no effect this time! </p><p></p><p>A strange blood color enveloped Li Fan's body. </p><p></p><p>Even though the space was shattering, it had no impact whatsoever. Li Fan stood firm in the midst of the fractured space. </p><p></p><p>"Physical body, soul, perfectly fused." </p><p></p><p>"The myriad laws do not invade..." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted, feeling his surging power. </p><p></p><p>His figure flickered, and in the next moment, he appeared beside Tianyang. </p><p></p><p>Countless blood threads erupted from his body, like millions of blood-colored long dragons, striking Tianyang. </p><p></p><p>At the same time, a silver light flashed in his eyes, setting up an array around them, blocking Tianyang's escape route. </p><p></p><p>Faced with Li Fan's overwhelming attacks, Tianyang's expression changed slightly. </p><p></p><p>Finding himself unable to evade, his whole body turned into a black mass, colliding with countless blood threads. </p><p></p><p>A huge roaring sound resounded incessantly, with each collision signifying the violent trembling of Tianyang's black mass. </p><p></p><p>In contrast, the violent blood color on Li Fan's side seemed almost endless. There was simply no weakening of his offensive momentum. </p><p></p><p>Even with spare energy, he showed his figure, watching Tianyang struggling intently. </p><p></p><p>Millions of blood threads completely enveloped Tianyang, forming a spherical blood cocoon around him, leaving him no way to escape, only able to awkwardly deal with it. </p><p></p><p>Supported by the endless spiritual power of the Five Elements Grand Heaven, Li Fan could constantly combat with maximum strength. </p><p></p><p>In contrast, the sealed Tianyang's breath became weaker and weaker. </p><p></p><p>In no time, he would probably be beaten to death by Li Fan. </p><p></p><p>Finally, Tianyang sent out a plea for mercy. </p><p></p><p>After continuing the attacks for a while, Li Fan stopped, not fully satisfied. </p><p></p><p>"Younger Junior Brother, how is it? Feeling rebellious?" Li Fan asked with a light smile. </p><p></p><p>Tianyang grunted, "I yield. Senior Brother, you're stronger." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan burst out laughing. </p><p></p><p>Purely overpowering someone was much more enjoyable than winning by tricks. </p><p></p><p>The thousands of blood threads were retracted into his body, but the state of soul burning remained. </p><p></p><p>It was just slightly restrained, dispersing some of the abnormalities that had previously manifested externally. </p><p></p><p>Although not as pronounced as before, there was still a blood glow enveloping him. Yet, Li Fan still appeared somewhat sinister. </p><p></p><p>"As long as it's not someone on Mr. Bai's level, ordinary Tao cultivators, even with three to five combined attacks, or even fighting in turns, probably couldn't outlast me." </p><p></p><p>"This is without me resorting to various magical powers." </p><p></p><p>After the battle with Tianyang, having figured out his approximate upper limit in strength, Li Fan nodded slightly. </p><p></p><p>"It's time to pay a visit to the Empire." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered. </p><p></p><p>Bringing Tianyang with him, he found the entrance to the Empire's small world with ease. </p><p></p><p>And then, rushing all the way, they soon arrived outside the Empire. </p><p></p><p>Not concealing his powerful aura, Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong had already sensed something, waiting with solemn expressions. </p><p></p><p>"Senior..." Xiao Qing looked at Li Fan with a hint of worry in her eyes, seeing his sinister aura, and tentatively spoke up. </p><p></p><p>"I am an envoy of the Multiverse Union. Your small world here has been requisitioned!" Li Fan announced coldly. </p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong's expressions changed drastically. </p><p></p><p>Even though there was a faint Taoist aura emanating from him, thinking that such a simple statement could bring the Empire under control was underestimating them! </p><p></p><p>"Empire Guards!" Xiao Qing transmitted discreetly, holding back her anger, and asked again, "The Multiverse Union, we've never heard of it. Senior's actions..." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan sneered, "It seems you still harbor delusions." </p><p></p><p>"Alright, let me show you the true power!" </p><p></p><p>Before he finished speaking, the phantom of the Five Elements Grand Heaven enveloped the Empire.</p>

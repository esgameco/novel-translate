            <p>Absorbed in thought, the golden figure swayed in a rhythmic pattern.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until the rhythm slowly passed that her senses gradually returned to clarity.</p><p></p><p>"The Elixir of Ten Thousand Spirits, perhaps the True Immortals do not care for it. But for me at present, it is indeed a rare and precious tonic." Daoist Baihua sighed softly and answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"The Elixir of Ten Thousand Spirits..." Li Fan deliberately pondered.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Upper Realms are not very familiar with this item?" Daoist Baihua, who had lived for countless years, immediately asked, sensing Li Fan's reactions and expressions.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then nodded slightly, "It's just an occasional gift from the True Immortals. True Immortals do not provide much guidance; everything mainly relies on my own comprehension."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, I did not deliberately deceive you before. I only know that there are immortals in the world, but I am truly not well-informed about the specific types of immortals."</p><p></p><p>After Li Fan finished speaking, he sensed a faint hint of jealousy emanating from Daoist Baihua.</p><p></p><p>However, Daoist Baihua quickly restrained herself and spoke gently, "Hence, I will help clarify for you. The so-called Elixir of Ten Thousand Spirits is the desire for the Dao by all beings with spiritual intelligence in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Dao, not the path of cultivation but referring to everything in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Born with desires, pursuing the Dao, never stopping until death..."</p><p></p><p>"This is the fate of us ordinary folks. (69shu.com)"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully pondered the words spoken by Daoist Baihua, feeling a hint of realization.</p><p></p><p>"By pursuing the Dao, the Elixir of Ten Thousand Spirits is born. This is the instinct of living beings and a great law of the natural order. For the True Immortals, perhaps the most valuable thing is the slightest trace of Dao in the wishes of living beings pursuing the Dao."</p><p></p><p>"And for us ordinary cultivators, this Elixir of Ten Thousand Spirits has various miraculous powers that can turn decay into marvels."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Listening to Daoist Baihua's explanation, Li Fan suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>Living beings pursue their desires, and this is the great eternal law of the world's operation.</p><p></p><p>If all living beings in the world had no desires, then the world would fall into disorder, unable to function properly, descending into total silence.</p><p></p><p>What the True Immortals pursue is the trace of the Dao brought forth by the wishes of ordinary people, known as the Elixir of Ten Thousand Spirits.</p><p></p><p>The Elixir of Ten Thousand Spirits, which Li Fan named the Golden Wishes, is actually an extraction of raw material from traces of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>After the traces of the Dao are absorbed, the Golden Wishes have no use for the faceless True Immortals and are thus discarded by them.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan was thinking about this, he heard Daoist Baihua say slowly, "I cultivate the Glass Body technique, which is formed from the visions of the flowers in the world and is closely related to the Elixir of Ten Thousand Spirits. Moreover, it is even purer..."</p><p></p><p>"Not only for me, but as long as it involves the desires of sentient beings, the Elixir of Ten Thousand Spirits has countless wonderful uses."</p><p></p><p>"Taking it when breaking through greatly reduces the chances of failure."</p><p></p><p>"Absorbing a small amount during cultivation can also greatly enhance progress."</p><p></p><p>"It is even said to be able to create objects out of thin air directly."</p><p></p><p>"Anything driven by desire, the Elixir of Ten Thousand Spirits can help promote it." Daoist Baihua's tone was full of admiration.</p><p></p><p>"But are there any side effects?" Li Fan was not swayed by Daoist Baihua's praise.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Baihua hesitated slightly, then said uncertainly, "I have heard that the more one uses the Elixir of Ten Thousand Spirits, the deeper the entanglements with desires become."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps when ascending to become an immortal in the future, it will become more difficult."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Daoist Baihua paused and continued, "However, the path to immortality has long been cut off now, so this side effect is practically nonexistent."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slowly.</p><p></p><p>This was indeed true. If the Elixir of Ten Thousand Spirits was as good as described, even if he couldn't use it, there would be no harm in keeping it. It would be unfair to let Li Fan benefit from something that is harmful to the True Immortals. Only by deliberately relinquishing substances harmful to the True Immortals could it be justified.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan turned to Daoist Baihua, "The Elixir of Ten Thousand Spirits is useless for True Immortals. The authority to use it lies with me. Rest assured, Daoist Baihua, if you sincerely serve as a disciple of the Compassionate True Immortal, you will surely not be left out in the future."</p><p></p><p>A hint of joy appeared on Daoist Baihua's face.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, now that you have entered the sect of the Compassionate True Immortal, as of today, you are also a member of our Ten Realms Union."</p><p></p><p>"I will show you around first."</p><p></p><p>Following that, Daoist Baihua followed behind Li Fan and toured the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Without being noticed by others in the realm.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Baihua sighed, "Although it is a small world, it is not much different from my homeland, Wansheng."</p><p></p><p>Her gaze rested on the various furnaces representing the heavens and the earth scattered throughout the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled, "To be honest, more than ten years ago, this place was just a very small boundary."</p><p></p><p>"It is precisely due to the various blessings bestowed by the True Immortals that the Spirit Wood Realm has continuously improved."</p><p></p><p>Daoist Baihua nodded.</p><p></p><p>With her insight, she naturally could see through Li Fan's words.</p><p></p><p>The realm was full of vitality, full of vigor. It was a sign of new life.</p><p></p><p>Back in the secret room, Li Fan then spoke solemnly, "Thousands of years ago, the lineage of the Compassionate True Immortals was destroyed by the rulers of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"I was fortunate to discover the statue of a True Immortal, received the grace of the True Immortal, and swore to restore the lineage of the True Immortals."</p><p></p><p>"Due to the formidable opponent, I intend to accumulate strength first, then unite all realms, and set things right!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan briefly explained to Daoist Baihua the ins and outs of the situation.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Baihua nodded, "I am also aware of the current situation in the Xuanhuang Realm. The one who bestows teachings, the Heavenly Venerable, is indeed formidable, but..."</p><p></p><p>"If it is possible for the Top Executive to receive assistance from the True Immortals, then there is no need to fear at all."</p><p></p><p>After experiencing the Elixir of Ten Thousand Spirits firsthand, Daoist Baihua had great confidence in the "Compassionate True Immortal".</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan shook his head slightly, "The favor of the True Immortals is unpredictable. Sometimes they descend inexplicably, while at other times, they may not be seen for years. Reclaiming the lineage of the True Immortals is a heavy and arduous task! However, Daoist Baihua, I have a doubt that has been bothering me, and I cannot comprehend it."</p><p></p><p>"You mentioned that the True Immortals have transcended, so they should not be concerned with these mundane matters. Why then do they still bestow rewards?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared at Daoist Baihua, trying to elicit an answer from her.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Baihua was slightly nervous and after a moment of contemplation, she gave her speculation, "Perhaps these are not gifts, but rather remnants of power left behind after the True Immortals absorb traces of the Dao?"</p><p></p><p>"After all, a long time has passed, and I am not sure what the immortals still existing in the world look like now."</p><p></p><p>"Not gifts, just remnants of power. It is truly disheartening..." Li Fan muttered to himself, although he felt no disappointment in his heart.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 746</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>When Li Chenfeng returned to the Empire, the deity had already passed through the surveillance of the formless killing mechanism and knew the entrance to the Empire.</p><p></p><p>However, he hadn't had a chance to go there before, so he took advantage of this opportunity to make a trip.</p><p></p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the rhombus-shaped crystal once again emitted colorful light, enveloping the Tianxuan Treasure Mirror below.</p><p></p><p>Controlled by Xu Bai, virtual images appeared one after another in the vibrant light.</p><p></p><p>Distorting the perception of the Tianxuan Treasure Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Then swiftly flew to the entrance location.</p><p></p><p>After a careful search, he indeed discovered a hidden spatial passage concealed by some special means.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai looked at the Tianxuan Treasure Mirror, which did not issue any alerts.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed useful."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai nodded to himself, not hurrying to enter.</p><p></p><p>After scanning with his divine sense and making sure there were no cultivators nearby, he took out a terminal disk and laid down a formation to cover the entrance.</p><p></p><p>Then he entered the spatial passage.</p><p></p><p>In sight was an endless darkness.</p><p></p><p>This scene was not unfamiliar to him; it was extremely similar to the void scenes opened up by countless Riftwhales when he crossed the Immortal Array.</p><p></p><p>However, this place seemed even more profound.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, the Clear Light Lustrous Robe crafted by Fang Zai emerged on his body. With an extra layer of protection, Xu Bai then flew forward.</p><p></p><p>He had traversed the Immortal Array countless times. He was already very familiar with it.</p><p></p><p>Without any surprises along the way, he smoothly passed through the grand array, but did not see any trace of the small world.</p><p></p><p>What greeted him was still the boundless dark void.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that I have already passed the Riftwhales and deviated from the original location," Xu Bai pondered.</p><p></p><p>Standing in the void, Xu Bai closed his eyes and focused on sensing.</p><p></p><p>Just a moment later, he faintly sensed a very familiar aura fluctuation in the distance in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Following the aura induction, Xu Bai flew rapidly.</p><p></p><p>As he was about to approach, a loud roaring sound of a whale suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai abruptly stopped his figure.</p><p></p><p>As if triggering some kind of chain reaction, one after another whale cries echoed near and far, without stopping all the way to the far distance.</p><p></p><p>It was impossible to distinguish how many Riftwhales existed in the dark void. They echoed each other, resonating back and forth as if playing a grand musical composition.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by these countless Riftwhales, Xu Bai did not feel the slightest sense of danger.</p><p></p><p>Because he could hear that these Riftwhales were just resonating to express their joy, as if welcoming Xu Bai's arrival.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting." Xu Bai's eyes flickered, and he continued to fly forward.</p><p></p><p>As the group of Riftwhales sensed his aura on the way, they voluntarily opened up a path for him.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Xu Bai had already arrived outside the Empire.</p><p></p><p>Looking from the dark void, it was an oval-shaped world. One could vaguely see large water bodies and...</p><p></p><p>The body of the 'Scarlet Nine-Headed' floating in the air.</p><p></p><p>While Xu Bai was observing intently, a strange fluctuation suddenly occurred in the space ahead.</p><p></p><p>Seven cultivators wearing beast-god armor, riding on an odd beast resembling an eel, suddenly appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you!"</p><p></p><p>These cultivators coordinated extremely well. As soon as they noticed Xu Bai, their expressions changed slightly. They quickly spread out, forming a formation to surround Xu Bai in the middle.</p><p></p><p>They were all wearing beast-god armor at the golden core realm. How could they be Xu Bai's opponents?</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai smiled slightly, waved the folding fan in his hand, and before they could react, he subdued all seven of them in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Oooh..."</p><p></p><p>They showed a look of horror but could not speak.</p><p></p><p>What happened next made their faces change dramatically.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai beckoned, and the 'Void Wanderer' dragon, which they had worked hard to subdue using the 'Heart Unity Technique,' moved very obediently towards the other party.</p><p></p><p>It even seemed to be ingratiating itself, actively sticking its head out and rubbing against the others.</p><p></p><p>This groveling appearance almost made the seven people think they were hallucinating! When did the ruthless 'Void Wanderer' become so docile?</p><p></p><p>Feeling the creature's affectionate intent, Xu Bai placed his hand on its head and gently stroked it.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Xu Bai also learned its name.</p><p></p><p>"It does have some dominance. However, possessing the ability to shuttle through space at short distances is quite remarkable even in the Profound Yellow Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Lead the way." He commanded.</p><p></p><p>The Void Wanderer let out a cheerful cry, swayed its body, and took the initiative to support Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai did not forget to grab the seven people who had been subdued on the side.</p><p></p><p>After a wave of fluctuations in space, in the next moment, Xu Bai arrived in the midst of the Empire.</p><p></p><p>A human kingdom built on the body of the Scarlet Nine-Head.</p><p></p><p>Stepping on the Void Wanderer, with seven beast-god warriors still in tow.</p><p></p><p>Even his appearance was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Xu Bai appeared, he almost captured the attention of everyone nearby.</p><p></p><p>After a brief trance, the surrounding area immediately fell into chaos.</p><p></p><p>"Enemy attack!"</p><p></p><p>"It's a cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"Where is the guard team!"</p><p></p><p>"Quick, go get the 'Saint Qing Master'!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Amidst the successive exclamations, hundreds of figures swooped over from various parts of the city.</p><p></p><p>Some were draped in beast-god armor, some were simply seated on various odd creatures.</p><p></p><p>Some even flew with their physical bodies. Judging from their aura, they were clearly cultivators similar to Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Although their numbers were numerous, the strongest were only at the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Bai protected by the Clear Light Lustrous Robe, he remained calm and fearless.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you, sir?"</p><p></p><p>Sensing that Xu Bai was different, they were very cautious and did not choose to attack directly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai did not answer, but just scanned around.</p><p></p><p>"What is your purpose in coming here?"</p><p></p><p>A cultivator from the Empire Guard team asked loudly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a green light flew out from the central part of the Empire's capital and arrived in front of Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>"Friend..."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing stood still, the words barely out of her mouth.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing Xu Bai's appearance clearly, she was thunderstruck and froze on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Master..."</p><p></p><p>Before the word "person" could come out, Xiao Qing felt that something was off.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the shock in her heart, she stared at Xu Bai for a long time before asking, "You are..."</p><p></p><p>Her tone seemed to contain a thick sense of doubt.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Xiao, do you know that your Empire is about to face great calamity?" Xu Bai smiled and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Bold bandit! How dare you speak arrogantly!"</p><p></p><p>"How dare you act so insolently in front of Saint Qing Master!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as this was said, it instantly caused everyone to be furious, and they began to curse loudly.</p><p></p><p>However, in Xiao's eyes, there was already a great surprise, "Do you know me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai nodded slightly and asked, "Do you still remember the Multiverse Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 835</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This is called the wonder of mankind.</p><p></p><p>The wonders of the earth and the wonders of the heavens are predominantly all derived from the Dao of the Yellow Emperor's world.</p><p></p><p>The Kun-Qian Bone Hand on Ou Shangtian's body is capable of reversing the universe, truly transcending the realm of human wonders and reaching a level close to the wonders of the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Yet, it still presents itself in the form of human hand bones.</p><p></p><p>This inevitably makes people contemplate.</p><p></p><p>Think about the wonders of the heavens you have encountered before, what do they look like?</p><p></p><p>The Transformation Jade, the Sword.</p><p></p><p>As well as the Dao Compass, the Yin-Yang Jade, the Qian-Kun Qi, and so on.</p><p></p><p>They are all creations of heaven and earth, without any "features" belonging to humans.</p><p></p><p>"The bones of man, close to the wonders of the heavens."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid only the legendary immortals can achieve this..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but think like this.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the shape of the bone hand displayed by Ou Daozi seemed somewhat familiar...</p><p></p><p>The Dao Stone flashed with blue light, recalling a scene from memory.</p><p></p><p>It was the Bone Scout Realm used initially to deceive the people who left the realm.</p><p></p><p>The reason why it was chosen among many available scout realms was also because Li Fan was deeply attracted by its unique and stunning scenery.</p><p></p><p>Different from other scout realms, which showcased beautiful scenery of the immortal family, this realm was built on top of a giant left hand bone.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by a dark and desolate space, the giant bone hand floated in the endless void.</p><p></p><p>Filled with a mysterious, eerie, and divine atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>According to the Fairy Zi Miaoxian who sold this Bone Scout Realm, the intention of this scene originated from the "Immortal" who created the entire Immortal Realm with just a thought.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan compared the two scenes.</p><p></p><p>There was no difference at all!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was shocked.</p><p></p><p>This was definitely not something that could be explained by mere coincidence.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was now extremely interested in anything related to the immortals.</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation, the clone Ji Shaoli, under the pretext of intending to rent the Bone Scout Realm for a long time, contacted the cultivator who called himself Zi Miaoxian.</p><p></p><p>Without using an anonymous pseudonym, Li Shaoli directly revealed his identity to Zi Miaoxian.</p><p></p><p>Unlike his previous indifferent attitude, Zi Miaoxian showed great enthusiasm towards Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, have you heard of me?" Ji Shaoli asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, since I'm doing business, how can I not find out in advance about potential customers in the Immortal Alliance?" Zi Miaoxian replied with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"After all, there aren't many cultivators willing to spend a lot of contribution points each year to rent scout realms."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>Based solely on the millions of contribution points he won from the Fish Head Prize, he wouldn't have attracted Zi Miaoxian's attention. It should be because of the recent activities of his clone, making profits through speculating and accumulating wealth in the market, that he came into the other party's view.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli was not afraid, but rather showed great interest in renting the Bone Scout Realm for a hundred years, or even considering a permanent purchase.</p><p></p><p>Zi Miaoxian became even more enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>He answered almost all the questions Ji Shaoli had about the origin of the Bone Scout Realm and why it was almost identical to Ou Shangtian's Kun-Qian Bone Hand.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Molt?" Ji Shaoli asked with interest.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the venerable Immortal once had the fortune to see a set of scrolls recording the 'Immortal Molt' before the Great Catastrophe. The images contained in it left a deep impression on the Immortal. Even though thousands of years have passed, it is still unforgettable. Therefore, when creating this scout realm, it imitated its form and spirit." Zi Miaoxian explained continuously.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli further inquired about more information regarding the Immortal Molt.</p><p></p><p>"Before the Great Catastrophe, when the Immortal road was not yet severed, the Yellow Emperor's world was still in communication with the Immortal Realm. Not only did the major Immortal sects have the protection of Immortal artifacts bestowed by the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>"There was also a piece of true Immortal Molt circulating in the world. The specific whereabouts and whose hands it fell into have long been unknown. However, this is confirmed, with many clues available for verification."</p><p></p><p>"This bone hand is one of the Immortal Molt. In addition to this, there are the Immortal's body, the Immortal's skull..."</p><p></p><p>"What a surprise that before the Great Catastrophe, various rumors of Immortal Molt appearing in the world surfaced. However, after the Great Catastrophe, the Immortal Molt and even the treasured Immortal artifacts of the sects all disappeared!"</p><p></p><p>"This caused chaos, directly exacerbating the process of the destruction of the Immortal sects."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli, upon hearing this, was somewhat lost in thought: "Immortal Molt and Immortal artifacts all disappeared?"</p><p></p><p>Zi Miaoxian sighed, "Yes. Until now, it remains a mystery, no one knows where they went. However, within the Yellow Emperor's world, the only thing currently related to the 'Immortal' is probably the Immortal Realm. Therefore, many cultivators who are aware of this issue believe that the missing Immortal Molt and Immortal artifacts are likely hidden in the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, there wouldn't be so many cultivators who are still steadfastly exploring the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>After that, Ji Shaoli failed to extract any useful information from Zi Miaoxian.</p><p></p><p>After some bargaining, Ji Shaoli ultimately purchased the Bone Scout Realm directly for 800,000 contribution points.</p><p></p><p>It seemed it had been a long time since Zi Miaoxian had met such a big customer like Ji Shaoli, and he was very excited. He promised to provide the maintenance of the scout realm free of charge for the next hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, if there were any future needs to purchase scout realms, Ji Shaoli could come to him for a discount.</p><p></p><p>The handover and processing of the scout realm were swiftly handled.</p><p></p><p>The perspective returned to the original Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"The person behind this account is probably not the true Zi Miaoxian."</p><p></p><p>"Those who can create space in nothingness, even among the cultivators of the Immortal Dao, are not weak. They wouldn't be so materialistic."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan once again speculated on the connection between the Immortal Molt and the Kun-Qian Bone Hand.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Molt lost to the Yellow Emperor's world."</p><p></p><p>"The power of heaven and earth is circulating, wanting to devour and refine it into their own laws."</p><p></p><p>"Judging from the appearance of this Kun-Qian Bone Hand, it seems to have succeeded in part."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder, where have the rest of the Immortal Molts gone now?"</p><p></p><p>"Could artifacts like the Transformation Jade, the Dao Compass, be related to the Immortal Molts?"</p><p></p><p>"Most importantly, regardless of Immortal artifacts or Immortal Molts, they are treasures of unimaginable value, and the major Immortal sects will certainly guard them strictly. In such circumstances, how could they vanish without a trace?"</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered, contemplating the possible reasons.</p><p></p><p>However, this ancient mystery was destined not to be deciphered by Li Fan, with just his mid-grade Dao Stone.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 876</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"It seems like there was a scene like that. However, I didn't quite understand its meaning and didn't pay too much attention to it."</p><p></p><p>Tianyang paid more attention to the use of spatial power contained in the underworld spirit body.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, Li Fan, who knew little about spatial abilities, focused entirely on the ancient mysteries.</p><p></p><p>It's like the story of blind men touching an elephant, each having a different perspective.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the water of the underworld here.</p><p></p><p>"This river can be called the creation river of the Hades realm. But with the destruction of the cycle of life and death, even if more power is added to it, the constant evolution of spiritual bodies will inevitably lead to its eventual drying up."</p><p></p><p>"When the underworld dries up, billions of spiritual bodies will drift out..."</p><p></p><p>"Under normal circumstances, this process may take thousands or even tens of thousands of years. But if it happens prematurely at the 115th age, it is very likely that the three-eyed skull was brought into the underworld for some reason."</p><p></p><p>"In order to be reborn, that skull will absorb all the power of the underworld water."</p><p></p><p>The knowledge of past lives and the current on-site investigation allowed Li Fan to deduce the possible truth that happened in this most remote small world of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, Li Fan did not touch the ever-flowing water of the underworld.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving with Tianyang, Li Fan quietly pondered, "If there is an attempt to escape the Xuanhuang world in this life, perhaps the Hades realm is an excellent experimental site."</p><p></p><p>After passing through a long spatial passage and spending nearly a month, Li Fan and Tianyang finally returned to the Xuanhuang world.</p><p></p><p>Half a year passed, and the war between the Five Elders Association and the Wanxian Alliance has been thoroughly ignited.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan did not expect that this time, the one who actively provoked the conflict was the previously disadvantaged Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>With a single move, they caught the Five Elders Association off guard, and even took back the lost territory of the Jiushan Prefecture!</p><p></p><p>The massive fortifications built on the nine mountain ranges by the Five Elders Association seemed completely ridiculous!</p><p></p><p>Despite achieving such results, the Wanxian Alliance surprisingly did not publicize it.</p><p></p><p>The members of the alliance only knew that continuous good news was coming, but how the Wanxian Alliance achieved such incredible results was still a subject of various speculations with no reliable conclusion.</p><p></p><p>However, everyone speculated that it might be related to the previous "Thirty-Three Immortal Candidate" plan.</p><p></p><p>During this period, the alternate self, Ji Shao Li, who presided over the Haixuan Island, also went to the fishing pond near the small temple to try to understand the truth of that battle from the seniorâ€™s mouth.</p><p></p><p>But the senior seemed immersed in the comprehension of the "fishing" technique and completely ignored him.</p><p></p><p>Due to the frontline defeat, the Five Elders Association seemed to become somewhat distrustful of the "Inter-World Union."</p><p></p><p>Attempts to contact and understand the inner workings of the war went unanswered.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shao Li had to temporarily give up.</p><p></p><p>In the meantime, Lin Ling gradually became acquainted with Liu Li. Lin Ling, despite having merged with the Tao practice, had just been born and had a childlike nature, showing no airs of a senior.</p><p></p><p>She always took the initiative to play with Liu Li.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, this seemingly naive but actually astute little Tao child let go of her guard.</p><p></p><p>By spending all day with Liu Li, when Li Fan saw Lin Ling again, he keenly noticed that the naturally born spirit seemed to have "awakened."</p><p></p><p>Or rather, she seemed more "human."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the little Tao child hiding behind Lin Ling, thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>For now, he didn't pay attention to her but instructed Lin Ling, "You come with me to the border of Jiushan Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>In the past, Lin Ling would have nodded without asking anything, but this time, a hint of doubt flickered in her eyes, and she seemed hesitant to speak.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze flickered, but he briefly explained, "I've been out for half a year and made some discoveries. It may be helpful for the current situation of the Five Elders Association."</p><p></p><p>Only then did Lin Ling bid farewell to Liu Li.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, with Li Fan, they traveled through the flowing veins of the earth.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the two arrived at a remote location in Jiushan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>After investigating to ensure there were no ambushes by cultivators around, they quietly emerged from the ground.</p><p></p><p>They surveyed the area, and looking at this familiar yet unfamiliar "Jiushan Prefecture," Li Fan and Lin Ling both seemed momentarily lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps in the future, Jiushan Prefecture will have to change its name."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Li Fan sighed lightly.</p><p></p><p>On the land of Jiushan Prefecture, the nine grand mountain ranges that used to span the area had been completely leveled by some unknown force.</p><p></p><p>The originally treacherous terrain of the prefecture had turned into a flat plain.</p><p></p><p>However, the territory made from the corpse of the exotic beast Tan was inherently unstable.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing another earth-shattering battle, this instability became even more pronounced.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, black spatial cracks could be seen everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"When Tianyang finishes his seclusion and comprehension, maybe I can bring him here to visit," Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Master, there seems to be a terribly fearful aura lingering here," Lin Ling's focus was different from Li Fan's.</p><p></p><p>She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and then said somewhat shockingly.</p><p></p><p>"If even merging with the Tao feels scary, it must be the power of a Longevity Realm powerhouse. Coupled with this horrifying scene of Jiushan being completely leveled..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be the interventions of the Ancestors?" she speculated.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan quickly dismissed this speculation.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't involve the safety of the Xuanhuang realm itself. Regarding disputes at this level, the Ancestors should be indifferent."</p><p></p><p>"Besides the Ancestors, who else in the Wanxian Alliance possesses a Longevity Realm power?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it the Eastern Pole from the records, or the curator Di Sanmao of the Museum of Ancient Treasures?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled the rumors circulating within the alliance.</p><p>"Could it really be related to the Thirty-Three Immortal Candidate plan?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>One of the Immortal Candidates, Wei Qi, once received a fragment of the End Disintegration Disc from Li Fan. Although it didn't have real-time communication functions, it could record most of Wei Qi's experiences in detail.</p><p></p><p>As long as he saw Wei Qi again, or if Wei Qi perished and the disc was damaged in the moment, the saved information would be synchronized to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Although curious about the methods of the Wanxian Alliance, Li Fan knew that it wasn't yet time to reap the benefits.</p><p></p><p>The longer he kept this hidden, the more secret information he could uncover.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait a little longer."</p><p></p><p>Suppressing this thought, Li Fan then emitted a special fluctuation contact with the Five Elders Association.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a long time without a reply, Li Fan did not give up.</p><p></p><p>He repeated the continuous signals.</p><p></p><p>After doing so for a total of seven times, a weak response came from a location in Jiushan Prefecture.</p>

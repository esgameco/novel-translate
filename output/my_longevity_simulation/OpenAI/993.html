        <div class="content">
            <p>"Suddenly appearing, is this a hint for me..."</p><p></p><p>There was no spider as the weaver on the web, as if it had appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's gaze, a butterfly fluttered its wings and landed on the web.</p><p></p><p>The butterfly did not sense any danger, feeling quite comfortable, moving back and forth on the web with its delicate feet.</p><p></p><p>This web was different from the usual ones, it didn't trap the butterfly. It was very strong, not even swaying a bit.</p><p></p><p>The butterfly played joyfully on the web.</p><p></p><p>But it couldn't live on the web forever; it still needed to find food to sustain itself.</p><p></p><p>So the butterfly flapped its wings again, wanting to take off.</p><p></p><p>But just at the moment it was about to leave the web...</p><p></p><p>Something happened that made Li Fan's pupils contract.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly sensing the butterfly's departure, the originally harmless web suddenly tightened at once.</p><p></p><p>An inexplicable force emerged, immediately pulling the butterfly back.</p><p></p><p>Caught off guard, the fragile body of the butterfly couldn't withstand the immense force, instantly torn into countless pieces. Adsorbed, evenly scattered on the pristine web.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, absorbed by the web, its body remnants blended with the web, no longer distinguishable.</p><p></p><p>And the web remained quietly in the corner, as if the earlier anomaly had never occurred. </p><p></p><p>â€¦ </p><p></p><p>Watching the entire process unfold, Li Fan took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Such a direct hint, where could he still not see, the ignored areas he had always neglected, the source of his vague unease, where did it really come from?</p><p></p><p>His previous conjecture was not off the mark.</p><p></p><p>Just like the butterfly trapped in the web, the faceless true immortal should not be interested in the weak Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Whether by relying on the power of the stone statue, or wandering around under the stone statue's eyes.</p><p></p><p>None of that would capture the true immortal's attention.</p><p></p><p>If he continued to maintain this state from start to finish, indeed, there wouldn't be any problems.</p><p></p><p>But if he wanted to break free from the true immortal's control, or suddenly show strength that would interest the true immortal...</p><p></p><p>The outcome would probably be like that of the butterfly, instantly torn apart and shattered into countless fragments!</p><p></p><p>Analysing Li Fan's situation, his current Yuan Ying realm, and his combat power fused with the Tao, aided by the faceless true immortal's stone statue, there shouldn't be any major issues.</p><p></p><p>But once he chose to confront the true immortal, just like the butterfly flapping its wings on the web instantaneously, it could immediately alert the faceless true immortal.</p><p></p><p>How fast would the true immortal react, could it affect or even hinder the progress of Li Fan's breakthrough?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had no way to speculate.</p><p></p><p>But when the 115th Immortal City's immortal extinguished the Vision of Mystery Yellow, his influence, the scenes around Li Fan after the ordeal didn't immediately dissipate.</p><p></p><p>And then a black domain appeared, where time continued to flow beyond the black domain.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this to some extent explained that when one's strength reached or approached the level of the nameless true immortal, it could have a certain impact on the functioning of the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>The crucial point was that Li Fan had been chosen as the "representative" by the faceless statue.</p><p></p><p>Even the golden wish power would manifest inside him...</p><p></p><p>It was truly delving deep into the web, entangled in many ways!</p><p></p><p>There was almost no difference before the true immortal.</p><p></p><p>The true immortal might not pay attention to ants under its feet, but when the ants suddenly emitted a dazzling light, it would certainly attract the true immortal's gaze!</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, Li Fan couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing the divine intuition in the dark allowed me to hesitate before facing the true immortal."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, without any psychological preparation, a direct confrontation with the true immortal..."</p><p></p><p>Even with Li Fan's current awareness, he had to admit that the situation would be "more bad than good."</p><p></p><p>After a brief shock, Li Fan calmed down.</p><p></p><p>The unease that had been lingering in his mind slowly dissipated, leaving him with little fear in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Because of the unknown, there was fear.</p><p></p><p>When he learned the source of the threat, Li Fan became calmer.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, it's not as desperate as imagined. After all, it's not a direct confrontation with the true immortal, but finding a way to break through in front of the true immortal."</p><p></p><p>"This world has just begun, there is still a long time, enough for me to contemplate."</p><p></p><p>"When I built my foundation, I could calmly break through in front of the Heavenly Doctor; now that my strength rivals the Tao, how can I not break through in front of the true immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Just then, there was a subtle change in the hidden web.</p><p></p><p>Another butterfly, gracefully flying, landed on the web.</p><p></p><p>Similar to what happened before, it was unknowingly trapped in a perilous situation on the giant web.</p><p></p><p>But this time, when the butterfly was about to take off, something different happened!</p><p></p><p>A sudden gust of wind passed by, causing the web itself to sway violently.</p><p></p><p>As a result, that inexplicable suction force did not occur.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, the butterfly quickly fluttered its wings and flew away.</p><p></p><p>Vanishing in the air.</p><p></p><p>As if in a play, after these two scenes were played out, the web, butterfly, and wind, all three suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, Li Fan also could not find any traces of their existence in this hidden paradise.</p><p></p><p>"This visual deception indeed has some tricks."</p><p></p><p>However, what Li Fan cared about was not how Mo Rubin displayed this scene, but the deep meaning behind it.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's the stone statue or the Jiuqing Spirit Jade, Mo Rubin is obviously trying to avoid them."</p><p></p><p>"Plus, with his hint, apparently, he already knows the consequences of being trapped in the true immortal's web."</p><p></p><p>"But from the current situation, he has already escaped from the true immortal's web."</p><p></p><p>Once again, a scene of a strong wind blowing and a butterfly taking off flashed before Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>And he vaguely sensed the areas he had overlooked before.</p><p></p><p>The faceless stone statue, as the token of the Xuantian Sect, should have been prevalent in the Xuantian Sect in the past.</p><p></p><p>But in the memory of Xuantiansi's Law King Ji Yuzhen, Li Fan hadn't seen the shadow of the faceless true immortal stone statue.</p><p></p><p>"Either there were no statues in the Xuantian Sect at that time."</p><p></p><p>"Or..."</p><p></p><p>"Some force directly cut off the existence and influence of the statues."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan couldn't help but squint his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Happening simultaneously on two Law Kings, this severance is by no means coincidental."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the destruction of the Xuantian Sect back then still hides many secrets, and Mo Rubin, who deeply understands the terror of the true immortal's power, doesn't even dare to speak directly."</p><p></p><p>"Can only use this abstract method as a hint..."</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's mind, there was a growing heaviness.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that this world needs a breakthrough, still needs help from Mo Rubin."</p><p></p><p>"Let's cooperate with him first to coerce the Tianxuan Mirror."</p><p></p><p>Thinking so, Li Fan floated away.</p>

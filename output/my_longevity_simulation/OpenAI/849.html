        <h1>Chapter 849</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The excerpt provided is from a Chinese novel.</p><p></p><p>Translated to English, it reads:</p><p></p><p>"Monkey mind and horse intention are beings that are fundamentally different from the rules of the mysterious yellow world. It seems that the celestial power left behind is a remnant of the heavenly way from the mysterious yellow world during the process of devouring and integrating other small worlds.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder that within the range shrouded by the Contrary Doctrine of Changsheng Tianzun, it still causes its own influence."</p><p></p><p>"The power of strangeness..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remembered that during the 114th era, in the process of confronting the Mysterious Web, the Futing Association had once created a great killing weapon called the “Fén Tiān Jiàn.”</p><p></p><p>The specifics of its manufacture are unknown, but the source of materials is precisely the increasingly bizarre occurrences at that time.</p><p></p><p>Replacing the heavens with the Mysterious Web, its power is no different from the celestial way of the current mysterious yellow world.</p><p></p><p>Since the Fén Tiān Jiàn could harm the Mysterious Web, it indicates that it can similarly inflict damage on the celestial way of the mysterious yellow world!</p><p></p><p>"Now it seems that although the power of strangeness is different from the rules of the mysterious yellow world, in the end, it is a kind of power that can be grasped and utilized. It is not illogical or unreasonable existence," Li Fan carefully examined the dazzling orb in his hand. "It's just that I never expected the Futing Association's research on the strange to have reached this point. If not pushed, I wonder how many methods they have hidden."</p><p></p><p>"But this is also reasonable," Li Fan suddenly remembered that when he met Gongsun Qixuan in the Cloud Sea Heavenly Mechanism Hall, he saw a huge map.</p><p></p><p>The map marked the locations where bizarre events occurred in the Cloud Sea.</p><p></p><p>"The Futing Association has always closely monitored the strange. It is completely normal to be able to preliminarily utilize it this time."</p><p></p><p>Monkey mind and horse intention are both related to mental powers and are terrifyingly bizarre, able to directly transform cultivators into anomalies.</p><p></p><p>After being transformed into a monkey mind, one's divine consciousness can be enhanced.</p><p></p><p>And turning into a horse intention can directly nourish the soul!</p><p></p><p>"When I took the [Horse Intention] before, I experienced the extremely surreal power. If you feel like you've died in the illusion, you would really fall in reality too! Consciousness can change matter..."</p><p></p><p>"From the fact that this dazzling orb is being massively put to use so cheaply, the Futing Association should have completely mastered the application of this rule from beyond the realm."</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a long time, Li Fan couldn't find a way to crack it.</p><p></p><p>He could hardly say he is well-versed in the rules of the mysterious yellow world, let alone this power beyond the realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan actually understands very well the current headache facing the Wulaohui (Five Elders Union).</p><p></p><p>There was a saying from a sage: "The rule of the sage is to empty the mind, fill the belly, weaken the will, strengthen the bone, and always make the people ignorant and desireless."</p><p></p><p>At present, the cultivators affected by the dazzling orb all identify themselves as the "Sons of Heaven's Mandate."</p><p></p><p>Their inherent revolutionary potential is simply incomparable to ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Before crossing over, Li Fan had read some online literature.</p><p></p><p>In those stories, almost all the protagonists were time-travelers.</p><p></p><p>Why?</p><p></p><p>Besides increasing reader immersion, it also creates anticipation.</p><p></p><p>The destiny of a time traveler is generally different from that of the natives.</p><p></p><p>Because they have seen another world and realized their "extraordinary," they can't possibly be as clueless as the natives.</p><p></p><p>They must make something happen.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the final outcome, there is bound to be a process of trying.</p><p></p><p>The dazzling orb dropped by the Futing Association actually has a similar effect.</p><p></p><p>It makes the affected cultivators think highly of themselves, higher than the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the tempering of the ninetieth era's reincarnation is indeed a great opportunity for the cultivators. It is enough to allow some to transform from a dragon to a phoenix, completing their transformation!</p><p></p><p>"Equivalent to tens of thousands of weakened time travelers appearing in the territory of the Five Elders Union."</p><p></p><p>"Brainwashed and permanently hostile."</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk..."</p><p></p><p>"The Futing Association is likely to also circulate useful techniques within the reincarnation illusion of the dazzling orb, which can be beneficial in the mysterious yellow world, helping these 'Sons of Heaven's Mandate' to progress quickly."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a look of schadenfreude.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how they handle it."</p><p></p><p>"Lin Ling, if the Wulaohui sends another message inquiring again, just ignore it for now," Li Fan instructed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling nodded in understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Mount a counterattack, which will cause internal chaos in the Wulaohui, giving them no time to pay attention to the Futing Association for the time being."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Futing Association really values this grand examination."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stroked his chin.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Amidst eager anticipation, the month-long grand examination finally came to an end.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators gradually returned from the Tianxuan Mirror, each with their joys and sorrows.</p><p></p><p>"Friend He, judging by your expression, you must have been well-prepared this time?" Six cultivators from the Cloud Sea Mutual Aid Society who had registered for the grand examination gathered together.</p><p></p><p>Originally, only four cultivators, including He Zhenghao, participated in the grand examination. However, after the announcement by the Immortal Alliance of the selection of thirty-three immortal candidates, two others were also moved, deciding to take the chance.</p><p></p><p>Even though they had far less preparation time compared to He Zhenghao and his four companions, judging by the expressions on their faces, the results seemed satisfactory.</p><p></p><p>"Last-minute cramming really worked." One of them named Wei Qizheng said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"The amount of material that Friend Ji provided was too much. I didn't have time to go through it all, so I just randomly glanced through and memorized some. But my luck was really good. The majority of the exam questions this time were those I had memorized!"</p><p></p><p>"The questions that weren't in the material, I feel I handled them well myself." Wei Qizheng shared his joy with everyone.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao stroked his beard, also smiling, "Doesn't that mean I have to congratulate Little Brother Wei in advance?"</p><p></p><p>The others also joined in the excitement.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like they all had the situation under control.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Ji Shaoliang lightly coughed, interrupting their vibrant atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>However, perhaps due to the recent eruption of the Immortal Venom not being distant, the cough still cast a shadow over the cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>Without Ji Shaoliang speaking, they all changed their expressions and looked over.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their inquiring gazes, Ji Shaoliang was somewhat speechless.</p><p></p><p>"I'm fine."</p><p></p><p>Waving his hand, he brought up the main point, "Once the results of the grand examination are out, you will inevitably face the scrutiny of the Futing Association. If they find out about knowing the exam questions beforehand, it wouldn't be good."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, they were all taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"However..." Ji Shaoliang smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Our mutual aid society has a secret technique called [Concealing the Sky with One Hand]. I will teach it to you later."</p><p></p><p>"With this secret technique to help, there is nothing to worry about!"</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao and the others were all delighted.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoliang lightly pointed at the foreheads of everyone, and after a moment, all the cultivators closed their eyes to comprehend and cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Taking this opportunity, Ji Shaoliang secretly observed.</p><p></p><p>The quickest to awaken was the cultivator named Wei Qizheng.</p><p></p><p>In previous eras, due to being friends with He Zhenghao, he had occasionally heard about this talented young brother from him.</p><p></p><p>But as Li Fan's horizons expanded gradually, encountering many geniuses, he stopped paying much attention to this person.</p>

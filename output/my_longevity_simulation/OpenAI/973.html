        <h1>Chapter 973</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The excerpt you provided is quite lengthy, so I'll provide a translation of a portion of it here:</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the "Like Me" ability of the person who initially seemed invincible, the actual combat power of the propagator Jiang was not as strong as Li Fan had imagined.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, there were still many tricks he hadn't used. Simply by relying on the combined divine thoughts of the million divine beings, Li Fan easily defeated him!</p><p></p><p>"Even if not dead, it would still be seriously injured!"</p><p></p><p>More importantly, it was the gray mold that was sent into the opponent's divine thoughts!</p><p></p><p>Previously cultivated by Li Fan with exotic beast flesh and sealed with colorful divine light, the split small mold was finally used by Li Fan as a weapon of destruction.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Li Fan had unintentionally taken a wrong turn!</p><p></p><p>He had really started to unconsciously think of himself as the propagator.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he always liked to speak vaguely and ambiguously. So during the process of being led on by the other party, he did indeed reveal many of his own secrets.</p><p></p><p>But not too many were exposed.</p><p></p><p>He exposed the fact that he was in the spirit wood realm. However, the Spirit Wood Realm was a name Li Fan had given to this small world himself and was not known to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>In the vast number of mysterious small worlds, which one was the Spirit Wood Realm?</p><p></p><p>Although the million divine beings were brought about by the practice of the Three Calamities and Hundred Catastrophes Bright Divine Law suggested by the Law Propagator, they were just transformations. The fundamental prototype was the Three Perils Ghost God Dark Record. That's why it was called a profound heavenly technique, and it was not wrong to say it was inherited from the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>He exposed the fact that Mo Rubin had infiltrated the high levels of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, but the other party only knew Mo Rubin's name.</p><p></p><p>As for who Mo Rubin was...</p><p></p><p>Anyway, the headquarters of the Immortal Alliance had so many people, so let them figure it out one by one. (The rest of the translation continues on)</p>

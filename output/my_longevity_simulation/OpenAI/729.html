        <h1>Chapter 729</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>According to Zhong Shentong himself, he suffers from a severe case of "procrastination syndrome."</p><p></p><p>Even just at the Foundation Building Realm, only when one's lifespan is about to end, using the tremendous pressure brought by imminent death can one achieve a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>This was how it used to be.</p><p></p><p>In this life, due to the reversal of life and death by the Transcendent Being of Nirvana and the establishment of the Nirvana Mansion, everyone can be resurrected. The pressure brought by death naturally no longer exists.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, eighteen years later, it will be another hero, so what if one dies?</p><p></p><p>One can simply start over in the next life, why bother working so hard!</p><p></p><p>With this lazy attitude, Zhong Shentong could not achieve a breakthrough in his realm, which was quite normal.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan's face twitched.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the 'Life and Death Secrets' of this life have been wasted. I wonder how Zhong Shentong comprehended the Seven-Colored Divine Light."</p><p></p><p>Thinking like this, he waved his hand and said to Liu San, "Forget it, if he dies, he dies. Let's just pretend I didn't mention this."</p><p></p><p>Liu San showed a strange expression but didn't inquire further.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, Fang Zaiji praised, "The Sect Leader is truly broad-minded, indifferent to life and death."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan ignored him and continued, "Liu, the production of the Elixir of Longevity can slow down for now. Let's sell all the current inventory first."</p><p></p><p>Liu San was startled for a moment and then reacted, "Is the era of cultivators exploring the White Mist coming to an end?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded, "It's been almost three years since the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance officially issued the decree. With the existence of the Nirvana Mansion now, cultivators are even more fearless of death. I estimate that the complete exploration is not far off. We should be prepared."</p><p></p><p>He then looked at the ever-expressionless Jiang Yushan, "Elder Jiang has always wanted to go out and take a look. I have found a way to conceal your true realm and forge your identity in the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Li Fan took out the [Ultimate End Stone Plate].</p><p></p><p>"This item can influence and shield the perception of the Precious Tian Xuan Mirror of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance," Li Fan vowed.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Fang Zaiji's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>He quickly flew closer, staring intently at the small stone plate in Li Fan's hand.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he rubbed the back of his head and looked at Li Fan, "Master... how is this used?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shrugged, "I don't know either. You'll have to research it yourselves."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji looked at Li Fan suspiciously, "Master, could it be that you don't want Little Jiang to go out, so you deliberately found this excuse?"</p><p></p><p>Little Jiang's eyes swept over Fang Zaiji, showing a hint of killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled, "Haha, I didn't expect Mr. Fang to make a mistake too. Although this stone plate looks inconspicuous, it is actually a secondary body of the Tian Xuan Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"But well, I can't blame you. Although Mr. Fang considers himself knowledgeable, after all, so many years have passed in the Xuanhuang Realm. It's normal not to keep up with the times..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji suddenly widened his eyes, "Secondary body of the Tian Xuan Mirror?"</p><p></p><p>He snatched the Ultimate End Stone Plate, studying it as if it were a treasure while muttering to himself, "This is a good thing..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan allowed Fang Zaiji to take the stone plate without stopping him. Thinking of the Embrace Stone Plate used by the Reverse Heaven Society in the previous life, Li Fan reminded, "Although this item may not have any extraordinary features on its own, if you cut out a small part of it, perhaps there may be some unexpected changes."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji nodded, but it was unclear if he really absorbed the information. As if possessed, he focused all his attention on the Ultimate End Stone Plate.</p><p></p><p>"When Mr. Fang has results from his research, Old Liu and you can go out openly in the future," Li Fan smiled and said to Jiang Yushan.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I will keep an eye on Old Fang!" Liu San was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan, however, hesitated and asked, looking at the Ultimate End Stone Plate, "Is this Tian Xuan Mirror related to the Xuan Tian Treasure Mirror of the Xuan Tian Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's puzzled look, Jiang Yushan explained, "The Xuan Tian Treasure Mirror is the supreme treasure of the ancient Xuan Tian Sect. After the ten major sects of the Immortal Dao eradicated the Xuan Tian Sect, this item has been lost. The ten major sects interrogated many remnants of the Xuan Tian Sect but never obtained any results. I also heard about it when I was a prison guard in the Undetermined Prison."</p><p></p><p>Liu San, upon hearing this, was suddenly shocked, "Xuan Tian, Tian Xuan, they are so similar? Could it be that the founder of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, who destroyed the ancient cultivation world, was from the Xuan Tian Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head, "I don't know about this. But Jiang Elder's words are worth looking into in the future."</p><p></p><p>Liu San hurriedly warned, "If the speculation is true, the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance will definitely tightly seal all information related to the Xuan Tian Sect. If the Young Master inquires rashly, it might attract suspicion."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, even if the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance is related to the Xuan Tian Sect, so what? The ten major sects watched us break out of the Xuanhuang Realm and head for death..."</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, we should thank the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance for seeking revenge for us," Liu San sneered.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan frowned slightly. After a moment of silence, he looked at Li Fan, "I know a method that can test whether this Tian Xuan Mirror is a legacy of the Xuan Tian Sect."</p><p></p><p>"The ten major sects, in order to capture the remnants of the Xuan Tian Sect, created a secret method called [Execution of Xuan]. When this secret method is used, as long as there are objects nearby related to the Xuan Tian Sect, one will have a sense of them in their mind."</p><p></p><p>"However, this sensing range is extremely small, almost fleeting, to perceive. Therefore, it has limited practicality. But I heard that now there are Tian Xuan Mirrors everywhere in the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, so it might be worth a try."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart stirred, pondered, and nodded, "Alright. I hope Elder Jiang will teach me!"</p><p></p><p>The secret method was not very complicated, and Li Fan had already learned it in an instant.</p><p></p><p>He immediately activated it and approached the Ultimate End Stone Plate.</p><p></p><p>But there was no reaction.</p><p></p><p>"Is it just a coincidence that the names are similar?" Liu San was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly thought of something and focused his mind on his doppelganger Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Bai was in the Political Affairs Hall, casually chatting with his new colleagues from the Nirvana Hall who had just taken office.</p><p></p><p>The Nirvana Hall is an organization established by the Nirvana Mansion in each state, responsible for all matters related to "reincarnation and resurrection," similar to the Chess Hall, Martial Arts Hall, etc.</p><p></p><p>Quietly bidding farewell to everyone, Xu Bai went to the Tian Xuan Mirror in the city, silently activated the [Execution of Xuan] secret method.</p><p></p><p>"Ding! Ding! Ding!"</p><p></p><p>The sharp and rapid sound suddenly rang in Xu Bai's ears.</p><p></p><p>In Xu Bai's view, the originally quaint mirror was now radiating a striking blood-red color.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed! The Tian Xuan Mirror is the supreme treasure of the Xuan Tian Sect, the Xuan Tian Treasure Mirror!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's heart chilled, and in an instant, he discontinued the secret method.</p><p></p><p>Many anomalies disappeared, and Xu Bai, composed, walked into the Tian Xuan Mirror.</p>

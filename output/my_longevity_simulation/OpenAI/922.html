            <p>However, they never expected that within a short period of time, the prey they were originally chasing after would suddenly transform and become the hunters.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage, Li Qing's combat power almost doubled.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, she was ruthless in her attacks, causing even more damage than Sima Jing in the later stages of Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that this group of people were only doing the job for money.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that things were not going well, they immediately decided to retreat.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wei Lu was anxious and couldn't help but stop them.</p><p></p><p>During this brief confrontation, Li Qing seized the precise opportunity and directly exposed Wei Lu, who had been hiding in the dark, and revealed his true identity.</p><p></p><p>Wei Lu was exposed, his face changing drastically.</p><p></p><p>Sima Jing was also furious, trembling all over, with a hint of killing intent in her eyes for the first time.</p><p></p><p>With things having escalated to this point, there was no way for it to end well.</p><p></p><p>Wei Lu made up his mind and, using all his wealth, managed to convince the group of retreating bandits to fight once more.</p><p></p><p>Both sides engaged in battle again.</p><p></p><p>With no more restraint, Li Qing and Sima Jing immediately found themselves at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>At a critical moment, in the midst of the battle, Li Qing seemed to have another breakthrough, causing a surge of Yin Qi in the Yin Wind Valley.</p><p></p><p>The two took the chance to escape.</p><p></p><p>After that, Li Qing and Sima Jing fought and retreated, and retreated and fought. rusux66.com</p><p></p><p>Fighting to sustain the fight.</p><p></p><p>In the process, the tacit understanding between the two of them grew stronger and stronger. As if they were connected in spirit, their combined attacks nearly doubled their actual combat power.</p><p></p><p>In the end, relying on the advantage of the Yin Wind Valley, they managed to turn the tables and achieve victory.</p><p></p><p>Watching Sima Jing's disgusted eyes, Wei Lu opened his mouth as if to say something.</p><p></p><p>But before he could speak, Li Qing had already crushed him.</p><p></p><p>With the crisis averted, Sima Jing completed the sect's trial mission with Li Qing's help.</p><p></p><p>The two returned to the sect together.</p><p></p><p>As for what happened in the Yin Wind Valley, although it was Wei Lu's deceit that triggered it, in the end, they killed each other out of hatred.</p><p></p><p>To avoid punishment from the sect, under Li Qing's persuasion, Sima Jing ultimately did not mention this to anyone.</p><p></p><p>And Wei Lu, the missing Foundation Establishment disciple, did not raise much attention. He was soon forgotten by people.</p><p></p><p>Although they had been very close, they still had to restrain themselves in front of others.</p><p></p><p>Sima Jing returned to the inner sect to report to her master.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she began to ponder how to persuade her master to accept Li Qing as a disciple, so that the two of them could meet frequently in the future.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing, on the other hand, concealed his identity and quietly arrived at the market, using the spirit stones he had gleaned from Wei Lu and others to purchase some hidden cultivation pills.</p><p></p><p>Until half a month later, Sima Jing's master, Huo Jingtong, couldn't resist Li Qing's persistence and finally agreed to meet him. rusux.com</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Huo Jingtong was still somewhat concerned about the fact that Li Qing had been castrated and changed from male to female.</p><p></p><p>However, all these concerns vanished when she met Li Qing in person.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing knelt down in the hall, waiting for Huo Jingtong to question him.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, a long time passed, and Huo Jingtong did not react at all. Li Qing thought his plan had failed and couldn't help but look up, only to find the other party still staring at him blankly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Huo Jingtong, being a Nascent Soul cultivator, had a deeper level of sophistication compared to Sima Jing, a young girl.</p><p></p><p>"Jing'er has already told me everything. You may leave."</p><p></p><p>She did not give Li Qing an immediate answer but spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing respectfully bowed and left.</p><p></p><p>However, from the spiritual gaze that had been locked on him the whole time, Li Qing knew that things had settled.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, seven days later, he received notice from the sect that he was officially accepted as Huo Jingtong's disciple.</p><p></p><p>Although many of the female disciples from the outer sect were reluctant to see Li Qing leave, they silently wished him well.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing also promised to come back often in the future.</p><p></p><p>After a tearful farewell, Li Qing moved to the Luoyue Peak in the Moonlit Mountains.</p><p></p><p>As those female disciples from the outer sect missed Li Qing so much, they started diligently cultivating. Surprisingly, many of them broke through their bottlenecks and were able to join the inner sect to be able to visit Li Qing frequently.</p><p></p><p>This is a story for another time; let's not dwell on it for now.</p><p></p><p>The Huo Jingtong lineage resided on the Luoyue Peak in the Moonlit Mountains, not far from the Lengyue Peak where Senior Sister Zhao was located.</p><p></p><p>On the Luoyue Peak, there were over a hundred female disciples, with the vast majority being innocent maidens.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's arrival here was like a mouse falling into a rice jar.</p><p></p><p>However, he endured with great perseverance, refraining from acting recklessly and first focused on practicing the cultivation technique taught by Huo Jingtong.</p><p></p><p>The authentic transmission of the Moonlit Lineage, "The Hundred Transformations of Moonlight," lived up to its reputation as a top-tier technique in the Great Dao Sect, far superior to the other miscellaneous techniques Li Qing had gathered before.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing pondered repeatedly and was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, when he tried to cultivate the technique, he was pleasantly surprised.</p><p></p><p>The transformation of the "Reverse Ethical Classic" seemed to have unique advantages for practicing "The Hundred Transformations of Moonlight" with his pure yin body.</p><p></p><p>After secluding himself for seven days, he had already cultivated the technique to a level matching his own cultivation level, which was the initial stage of the Golden Core realm.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Li Qing discovered that practicing both techniques simultaneously did not burden him.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, they complemented each other, mutually reinforcing.</p><p></p><p>This made him, who already had a frighteningly fast cultivation speed, have room for further growth.</p><p></p><p>For a while, he dealt with Sima Jing in his spare time, while dedicating all his remaining energy to cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Until both the "Reverse Ethical Classic" and "The Hundred Transformations of Moonlight" were fully cultivated to the initial stage of the Golden Core realm, he stopped.</p><p></p><p>Calculating the time, Li Qing was somewhat shocked to find out that only three months had passed.</p><p></p><p>After all, beyond the Golden Core realm, the cultivation speed for ordinary cultivators was usually measured in years.</p><p></p><p>It was a common occurrence to undergo a decade or more of seclusion at once.</p><p></p><p>For someone like him, who did not rely on any external items and had barely consumed any spirit stones during his cultivation, to reach the initial stage of the Golden Core realm in just three months...</p><p></p><p>It was simply unheard of!</p><p></p><p>However, luckily, Li Qing felt a bottleneck that made him somewhat relieved.</p><p></p><p>"With the current state of my pure yin body, it seems inadequate to continue cultivating the Reverse Ethical Classic."</p><p></p><p>"I need more, purer yin energy."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>The figures of the hundreds of beautiful female disciples on the Luoyue Peak, of various shapes and temperament, involuntarily surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>All these were excellent resources for his cultivation!</p><p></p><p>However, this was still the inner sect of the Great Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation at the initial stage of the Golden Core realm was not enough to allow him to act recklessly.</p><p></p><p>If he was caught behaving improperly, he was afraid he would be instantly stripped of his cultivation and expelled from the sect.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Qing made a decision...</p>

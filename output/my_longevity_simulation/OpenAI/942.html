        <h1>Chapter 942</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Looking at the whole Xuanhuang world, besides me, who is willing to accompany you for a thousand rounds of chess? Most likely, there is no one else, right?"</p><p></p><p>With a smile, Shengtai dropped a piece on the board and asked back. </p><p></p><p>This first move was directly placed on the position of "Tianyuan."</p><p></p><p>The messy old man's face changed, he glanced at Shengtai, and his expression became extremely serious.</p><p></p><p>"You, kid, clearly only have the cultivation of Yuanying. Your calculating ability is surprisingly strong. Moreover, you don't even bother to disguise it, sitting directly next to me."</p><p></p><p>"It's obvious you came prepared!"</p><p></p><p>"I was somewhat delighted at first, thinking that after all these years, I could finally have some play. It wasn't until halfway through that I realized I had fallen into your trap!"</p><p></p><p>The old man sighed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Shengtai just smiled without replying.</p><p></p><p>The messy old man's name is Qianxun Daoren. He is an old-school Dao master who fell in cultivation due to injuries.</p><p></p><p>It is unknown what contributions he made to the Fairy Alliance in the past, as he surprisingly carried a "Qinfa Jade Pendant.”</p><p></p><p>Of course, at this point in time, few people in the world knew about this.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the public, this Qianxun Daoren was just an ordinary cultivator with a bit of insanity.</p><p></p><p>Only more than ten years later, a mortal named Xiaoshengke met Qianxun Daoren.</p><p></p><p>After accompanying Qianxun Daoren in begging for a thousand days, he was gifted the Qinfa Jade Pendant.</p><p></p><p>With an ordinary body, he met the Yansuo Emerald as a commoner.</p><p></p><p>Acquiring the Dao method from the Dao master, he embarked on the path of immortality. </p><p></p><p>This event was often talked about by later generations.</p><p></p><p>Shengtai found Qianxun Daoren naturally for his Qinfa Jade Pendant.</p><p></p><p>However, begging for a thousand days is too long. So, deliberately provoking the other person to play chess with him using words.</p><p></p><p>Qianxun Daoren, his name is closely related to his Dao methods.</p><p></p><p>Everything must be done in one thousand steps, and one needs companionship.</p><p></p><p>While playing chess with Shengtai, he was actually practicing.</p><p></p><p>The only limitation was that he could not actively mention the original intention to others. After completing a segment of "Qianxun" cultivation, his appearance and aura would change as if he were a different person.</p><p></p><p>So, everything depends on fate.</p><p></p><p>But Shengtai, Li Fan, learned about this in advance.</p><p></p><p>When the last piece fell, Shengtai Li Fan was just one step away, but ultimately lost to Qianxun Daoren.</p><p></p><p>"You brat, at least you know to let me win a game."</p><p></p><p>Although he won, Qianxun Daoren didn't feel happy no matter what.</p><p></p><p>He overturned the chessboard again, but this time the black and white pieces dispersed into the air on their own.</p><p></p><p>A surge of energy emanated from the old man's body.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, senior, you are not far from merging Dao again!" Shengtai Li Fan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want?" Qianxun Daoren didn’t beat around the bush and asked directly.</p><p></p><p>"The Qinfa Jade Pendant."</p><p></p><p>"Get lost!" Qianxun Daoren threw the jade pendant directly at him.</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan could respond, the old man's figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Shengtai put away the jade pendant, seemingly unconcerned. Anyone who lost nine hundred and ninety-nine games in a row, always with the situation where they were just one step away from victory, would surely be a bit irritable.</p><p></p><p>Not retaliating physically was already considered a sign of Qianxun Daoren's high quality.</p><p></p><p>"With the Divine Dao Stone's guidance, there are rare few in the world who can defeat me in a game of chess."</p><p></p><p>Shengtai shook his head slightly, arriving at a secluded place with no one around.</p><p></p><p>He directly used the Qinfa Jade Pendant.</p><p></p><p>Before this, he had already sorted out his identity within the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>So the whole process went smoothly without any surprises.</p><p></p><p>As usual, a cultivator arrived to guide him, and a door appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>However, after a moment of dizziness, he found himself back at the headquarters of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance...</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Looking around, it was not the scene of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance's headquarters.</p><p></p><p>Several figures stood in a light sphere by a fictional lake.</p><p></p><p>Intermittent voices could be heard coming from them.</p><p></p><p>"Do your best and leave the rest to fate."</p><p></p><p>"That doesn't sound like something you'd say."</p><p></p><p>"Our strengths are too disparate, we can only give it our all."</p><p></p><p>"Fine, go then. We don't know if it will be good or bad."</p><p></p><p>…</p><p></p><p>The voice of one of the figures sounded somewhat familiar to Shengtai Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>But it was also entirely different from anyone else.</p><p></p><p>He knew this was an illusion induced by the Patriarch's influence upon entering the alliance's headquarters for the first time.</p><p></p><p>However, for some reason, it was different from what he had seen regarding the original body and the clone before.</p><p></p><p>"Is one of the figures here the Patriarch?"</p><p></p><p>"What does this signify?"</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan could contemplate further, he suddenly felt the world quaking, and the images shattered layer by layer.</p><p></p><p>He exited the illusion and appeared back at the Immortal Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>Used to such occurrences, the guiding cultivator briefly explained before leading Li Fan to where Yanfa Jue was.</p><p></p><p>With the same familiarity as in previous lives, the encounters were identical.</p><p></p><p>Until entering the inner sanctum of the protective hall, the notification that reached his ears left Li Fan in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"User of Yanfa Jue request, Van Li."</p><p></p><p>"Identification number: 005. Authorization level: Merging Dao."</p><p></p><p>"Please wait patiently here. The estimated remaining wait time is three thousand six hundred and twenty-three days and six hours."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan initially thought he misheard, but after listening again, he was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Why do I have to wait for so long?"</p><p></p><p>Doubting his mind, he made a corresponding expression, couldn't help but ask the empty space.</p><p></p><p>"If unwilling to wait, feel free to leave."</p><p></p><p>"Warning, leaving means voluntarily forfeiting the right to use the Qinfa Jade Pendant."</p><p></p><p>"I am number 005, yet I need to wait for almost ten years. How does that make sense?"</p><p></p><p>"I haven't used Yanfa Jue before? How long does it take to deduce a method? There must be someone abusing public resources!"</p><p></p><p>Despite not showing any fear, Li Fan ramped up the protest.</p><p></p><p>One figure manifested slowly before his eyes in response to Li Fan's uproar.</p><p></p><p>Expressionless, the figure stared at Li Fan as if he were a dead man.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan instantly straightened up, "Let me take a look, perhaps I can help."</p>

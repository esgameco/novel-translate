            <p>Without waiting for the imperial princess to react, Xiaoqing and Xiaohong became excited: "What did you find?"</p><p></p><p>"What, you want to know too?" Xu Bai smiled and said, "Then let's exchange it for the Sacred Blood to Fetus Transformation Technique."</p><p></p><p>Xiaohong was about to speak, but was stopped by Xiaoqing.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she calmed down slightly, took a deep breath, and said to Xu Bai, "Just based on this sentence, you want to deceive us so easily? At the very least, you must let us know if the information you obtained is really worthy of exchange."</p><p></p><p>"Reasonable." Xu Bai nodded approvingly and then held out his right hand.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a jet-black feather appeared in Xu Bai's palm.</p><p></p><p>From that feather, Xiaoqing and Xiaohong both felt a familiar aura.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaohei?" Their bodies shook, and they exclaimed together.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to take the feather and examine it carefully, they realized that Xu Bai had already taken it back ahead of them.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that you are not unfamiliar with this Destiny Phoenix after all. It saves me from having to explain further."</p><p></p><p>"Thanks to the Ten Thousand Realms Union, which allows communication between the realms. I was fortunate to find Xiaohei's remains in a small world."</p><p></p><p>"This feather of the Destiny Phoenix is the only thing left on its corpse. Along with it, there is a segment of Xiaohei's memories from when it was alive."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Xu Bai suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaohei is dead?" Xiaoqing and Xiaohong were a bit shocked at first, then stared at Xu Bai intently.</p><p></p><p>Teasing their curiosity, Xu Bai glanced at them, then chuckled, saying, "Xiaohei is more loyal than you both. It sacrificed its own life to search through countless small worlds of the Xuanhuang Realm in order to find traces of my ancestor."</p><p></p><p>"Although it died without finding Xu Ke, it did not return empty-handed."</p><p></p><p>"Xu Ke, most likely still alive," Xu Bai said slowly.</p><p></p><p>His words, whispered softly, sounded like thunder in the ears of Xiaoqing and Xiaohong.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!" They both exclaimed in denial.</p><p></p><p>"If the master is really alive, then we would surely sense it. But a long time ago, we lost our connection with him," Xiaoqing furrowed her eyebrows, her eyes flashing with a hint of killing intent. "To fabricate lies about our master's life and death just to obtain the Sacred Blood to Fetus Transformation Technique..."</p><p></p><p>Facing Xiaoqing and Xiaohong who could explode at any moment, Xu Bai remained calm and unafraid, shaking his head and sighing, "That's why Xu Ke favored Xiaohei so much. For the sake of finding traces of my ancestor, it spared no effort, even at the cost of its own life force, to traverse various small worlds in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Even though it failed to find Xu Ke until death, it didn't come back empty-handed."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai suddenly stopped at this point.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaohei visited a few of the small worlds himself, excluding them. After confirming this, the most likely scenario is that my ancestor did not leave the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"So..."</p><p></p><p>Finally understanding, a glimmer of hope flashed in Xiaoqing's eyes as she stared at Xu Bai, "The master is in the remaining small worlds?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai neither confirmed nor denied, instead of changing the subject unintentionally, "Even though the countless small worlds in the Xuanhuang Realm are endless, we know that there is a limit."</p><p></p><p>"Xiaohei visited some of them in the past and eliminated them. The first thing we can be sure of is that my ancestor did not leave the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"So..."</p><p></p><p>Realizing this, Xiaoqing's eyes showed a hint of hope as she stared at Xu Bai, "The master is in the remaining small worlds?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai neither confirmed nor denied but changed the subject, "Even though we know this, facing the vast unknown small worlds, we are basically powerless. But now it's different."</p><p></p><p>"Now that the Immortal Alliance aims to unify the Xuanhuang Realm, all small worlds are to be thoroughly investigated and conquered."</p><p></p><p>"With numerous cultivators sacrificing their lives for the conquest, many secrets of the small worlds have been revealed. As a result, the possible range where Xu Ke might be has narrowed down."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Xiaohong finally couldn't help but speak, "Doesn't that mean the master is likely to be in danger?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai nodded, "If the Immortal Alliance finds Xu Ke before us, given their current style, the outcome may not be favorable."</p><p></p><p>Xiaohong's face instantly turned grim, "No, I must..."</p><p></p><p>"Calm down, Red," Xiaoqing intervened.</p><p></p><p>She used her eyes to signal Xiaohong to restrain herself, then said to Xu Bai, "Your words are not convincing."</p><p></p><p>"Setting aside the lack of evidence of the master's survival, even if he is still alive, how can we ensure that the small worlds the Immortal Alliance has explored..."</p><p></p><p>Before she could finish her sentence, Xu Bai burst into laughter, interrupting her.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Green, aren't you so rational?" Xu Bai admitted, "I agree, everything I just said was based on speculation derived from Xiaohei's memories. But can you deny the possibility of Xu Ke still existing in the remaining small worlds?"</p><p></p><p>"Faced with countless unknown small worlds, Xiaohei was fearless. Now that the scope has greatly narrowed, you still can't face reality," Xu Bai stared directly at Xiaoqing, questioning her.</p><p></p><p>Xiaoqing trembled as if struck by a heavy blow, trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Her mouth opened, but no sound came out.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, all I seek is a technique that Xu Ke casually passed down. Who would have thought that those around him would disregard his life for a mere technique like the Sacred Blood to Fetus Transformation," Xu Bai said somewhat mockingly.</p><p></p><p>Xiaoqing was about to speak when the silent Empress finally spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"I agree to your request. Whether the Sacred Emperor is dead or alive, I will never let him wander away again," the Empress said firmly.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the Empress's decision, Xiaoqing and Xiaohong fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai nodded in approval, "A wise decision."</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand lightly, and a map of the Xuanhuang Realm appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>"For thousands of years, the Xuanhuang Realm has undergone earth-shaking changes."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 735</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In an instant, a formation appeared under the feet of the three.</p><p></p><p>Chu Zongyi was excited, while Li Fan remained calm.</p><p></p><p>As the formation shone brightly, they all turned into flowing lights together, like meteors flying backwards, reaching the city of spirit stones in the sky from the market.</p><p></p><p>Just a few breaths later, the three had already stepped onto the ground made of spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"Oh...” The density of spiritual energy in the city above had reached a terrifying level, rushing madly into their bodies, causing blockages in the flow of spiritual energy. Chu Zongyi's face turned purple, as if a mortal was choked and unable to breathe.</p><p></p><p>It was Li Fan who suddenly patted his back, saving him.</p><p></p><p>Cough...” After returning to normal, Chu Zongyi greedily absorbed the pure spiritual energy around him, with a look of amazement on his face.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the guide, Ji Shiwu, flashed a hint of satisfaction in his eyes. However, after seeing Li Fan's expressionless face, his expression instantly darkened.</p><p></p><p>Passing through the city of spirit stones, Li Fan finally saw Ji's ancestral elder in a central garden.</p><p></p><p>Contrary to the imagined elderly appearance, Ji Wangxian turned out to be a young man in his twenties.</p><p></p><p>With shoulder-length hair, handsome features, and starlight shining in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Ji Shiwu respectfully bowing and addressing him as "Ancestor," Li Fan and Chu Zongyi would have a hard time believing the identity of this "young cultivator" before them.</p><p></p><p>"Is it you who want to see me?" Ji Wangxian asked in a soft voice.</p><p></p><p>Even without deliberate pressure, the aura unintentionally emanating from him made Li Fan and Chu Zongyi feel a sense of unease.</p><p></p><p>Chu Zongyi nodded repeatedly, about to explain the whole situation.</p><p></p><p>But he was stopped by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Looking at his own biological father, Li Fan calmly said, "Some matters are better kept confidential. It's not appropriate with this person around."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shiwu was furious, "You..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could fully react, Ji Wangxian raised his hand to stop him.</p><p></p><p>Ji Wangxian chuckled lightly, "You, little kid, are quite interesting. Shiwu, you may step down."</p><p></p><p>How dare Ji Shiwu disobey the ancestral elder's orders? Fury filled his eyes as he left in resentment.</p><p></p><p>"So, can we talk now?" Ji Wangxian said, restraining his smile.</p><p></p><p>Chu Zongyi shivered in excitement and hastily recounted the detailed plan for the Heavenly Sword Sect's need for a large amount of Taiyuan Jingjin to forge the divine weapons that would help in their promotion to the next Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>"Ji, with the formidable strength of your World Commerce Association, if you participate, the position of Sect Master is almost certain. Once we, the Heavenly Sword Sect, leave, the entire territory within ninety thousand miles of the Heavenly Sword Mountain will be under your control..." Chu Zongyi passionately persuaded.</p><p></p><p>However, Ji Wangxian was different from what they had imagined; he showed no interest.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he sighed, "Everyone knows that the position of Sect Master of the Heavenly Sword Sect is just a nominal title. The true power holder of the sect is the 'Senior Brother,' Situ Yao."</p><p></p><p>"Taiyuan Jingjin, a rare and valuable material. The cost of forging divine weapons..."</p><p></p><p>"Even with the financial strength of our World Commerce Association, satisfying the requirements for forging divine weapons will be costly. All for an empty title..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Wangxian suddenly looked at Li Fan, "You are... Ji Zhaoxuan, right? Since you returned home for the first time after leaving, do you think this plan is feasible?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly, "It's not feasible."</p><p></p><p>Chu Zongyi was stunned, "Ji Junior Brother..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued, "But we can make a wager."</p><p></p><p>A trace of brilliance erupted in Ji Wangxian's eyes, he laughed heartily, "Good, you remind me of myself in the old days."</p><p></p><p>"You are right! This matter is too uncertain, the risk and reward are not proportional. When the time comes, the Heavenly Sword Sect will leave without a trace, and we won't be able to find any creditors."</p><p></p><p>"But, indeed we can make a wager!"</p><p></p><p>"The foundation of the Immortal Dao Ten Sects. If our World Commerce Association can merge..." Ji Wangxian stood with his hands behind his back, turned his head, gazed into the distance, and spoke mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, everything changed.</p><p></p><p>Chu Zongyi was pleasantly surprised to hear the elder's approval. The subsequent events unfolded unexpectedly smoothly, beyond Li Fan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>In the incredulous gaze of Ji Shiwu, Li Fan and Chu Zongyi returned with three thousand catties of Taiyuan Jingjin from the World Commerce Association's inventory.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Ji Wangxian stated that the World Commerce Association would fully purchase Taiyuan Jingjin in the future to support "Ji Zhaoxuan" in his bid for the position of Sect Master of the Heavenly Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly generous, they did not require any commitments from Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>If Li Fan didn't know that this body had shown signs of uncontrollable autonomous action, he would have been moved by this unconditional trust.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Ji's family is very confident in their ability to control the spies sent to various sects," Li Fan coldly laughed in his heart, contemplating a way to unravel this.</p><p></p><p>Back in the Heavenly Sword Sect, Li Fan handed over the three thousand catties of Taiyuan Jingjin and mentioned that there would be a continuous supply in the future.</p><p></p><p>This caused a sensation throughout the sect.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that the disciples had only collected a total of slightly over a thousand catties during this time, including the sect's original inventory.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, alone, obtained more than three times that amount.</p><p></p><p>After presenting several pots of fine wine brought back from the Ji's residence to Situ Yao, the current senior brother of the Heavenly Sword Sect, praised Li Fan as a model disciple of the Heavenly Sword Sect.</p><p></p><p>Under the promotion by Chu Zongyi, the background of Li Fan from the World Commerce Association gradually spread.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the front door of Li Fan's residence was bustling, with a continuous stream of senior brothers and sisters visiting to establish relationships.</p><p></p><p>Most of the Heavenly Sword Sect cultivators believed that Li Fan was a strong contender for the next Sect Master position.</p><p></p><p>With the continued delivery of Taiyuan Jingjin from the World Commerce Association, everyone became more confident in their judgment.</p><p></p><p>At this critical juncture, Li Fan quietly visited the current Sect Master of the Heavenly Sword Sect, Huo Yuzhu.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Isn't this our pillar of the Heavenly Sword Sect, the designated successor to the Sect Master? What brings you to me?" Huo Yuzhu had a smile on his face, but a hint of sarcasm flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained composed and openly said, "I'm here for the Sect Master position."</p><p></p><p>Huo Yuzhu's expression changed, "Junior, don't think that..."</p><p></p><p>"Huo Master, don't you want to give up your position willingly? Even if it's just a nominal position, the authority of the Sect Master still affects people. Listening to what I say, don't you think?" Li Fan saw through Huo Yuzhu's words and his expressions changed, so he continued.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly do you mean?" Huo Yuzhu's face showed confusion, not understanding Li Fan's intention.</p><p></p><p>"I know of a place with a large amount of Taiyuan Jingjin, definitely more than what our Ji family can gather. I intend to exchange the position of Sect Master of the Heavenly Sword Sect for complete freedom. Can the Sect Master help me?" Li Fan asked with a smile.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 909</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>A change from the previous lazy and lurking appearance, becoming extremely aggressive.</p><p></p><p>The relentless appearance made Li Fan feel a bit chilling.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for his Five Elements Grand Heaven constantly supplying spiritual power, in such a short time, there might have been a risk of the Rainbow Light Seal being broken.</p><p></p><p>"It truly is a beast that can destroy the world..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt a chill in his heart, his hands constantly working, continuously strengthening the seal.</p><p></p><p>Originally just a thin cocoon of light, until Li Fan reinforced it into a thick ball of light. The gray mold lost its sensitivity to the golden wish force, and finally became calm again.</p><p></p><p>Returned to the interior of the dark golden skull, lurking once again.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I guessed correctly. This golden wish force is indeed a power on the same level as the characters represented by chaos, hunger, and gray mold."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, for these three characters, the golden wish force is very likely a great supplement."</p><p></p><p>"In other words, perhaps with the golden wish force, it is possible to perform and reproduce the three characters of the true immortal seals."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan couldn't help but fall silent.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, it was a very tempting idea, but the result of doing so might not be something he could bear.</p><p></p><p>The destruction of the world was a trivial matter. If it attracted true immortals within the Immortal Domain or even alerted unknown higher existences...</p><p></p><p>Then it was very likely that he wouldn't even have time to activate the seal.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan still remembered, in the end of the 115th life, when the true immortal wiped out the Xuan Huang and the automatic activation of the real truth.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings did not immediately become blurred.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they were in a very strange state.</p><p></p><p>Outside of the real truth, it was pitch black, forming a circular domain.</p><p></p><p>And outside the domain, scenes of the destruction of the Xuan Huang Realm swiftly flashed.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, at that moment, the power of the true immortal was still somewhat affected.</p><p></p><p>"Even if I were to try, it must be done by a split that has had its memories cut off. Alternatively, by borrowing someone else's hand. I believe that in the Xuan Huang Realm, there are still many who are interested in the power above longevity."</p><p></p><p>Faces flashed through Li Fan's mind, already figuring out suitable targets.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, there was a sensational incident in the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this "sensation" only occurred in a certain specific circle.</p><p></p><p>That was, the former chief strategy master of the Tactician Hall, Lu Xichan, had returned.</p><p></p><p>Previously, due to the consecutive leakage of the defense array of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, and the inability to find the spy, Lu Xichan resigned out of public anger.</p><p></p><p>After so long, even though the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance had still not found the real leak, they had simply found a scapegoat. But the impact of the incident gradually subsided, so Lu Xichan was reinstated.</p><p></p><p>However, according to rumors, Lu Xichan's return might have been supported by a powerful figure behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>As a result, everything went smoothly, even factions within the Immortal Alliance that had always been at odds with Lu Xichan chose to remain silent.</p><p></p><p>After Lu Xichan's return, there were frequent major movements.</p><p></p><p>Elite formation masters were transferred from various states' Tactician Halls to the headquarters of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, and their intentions were not hidden.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan almost effortlessly found out.</p><p></p><p>A comprehensive improvement of the existing defense array of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance. And they aimed to create a level of power equivalent to the Supreme Law through formations.</p><p></p><p>During this confrontation period, Lu Xichan, under the guise of confronting the Five Elders, had managed to avoid any opposition.</p><p></p><p>Then, any formation masters with decent talents within the states were chosen.</p><p></p><p>Including He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>From He Zhenghao's constant prayers to the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal, it was clear that he himself was quite excited.</p><p></p><p>And he even fantasized that if he could demonstrate his extraordinary formation talent in this matter, he might be able to return to the Heng Family gracefully and show off!</p><p></p><p>As the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal, upon realizing He Zhenghao's thoughts, naturally, Li Fan's compassionate side came forth and he decided to help him.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in the days to come, He Zhenghao would often have various details about the [Xuan Tian Sealing Formation] floating in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"If my guess is correct, the figure behind Lu Xichan should be Moru Bin. And he probably doesn't have good intentions..."</p><p></p><p>"His real goal should be the Tianxuan Mirror."</p><p></p><p>Judging from Li Fan's previous reincarnation experience, Moru Bin, as the Law King of Xuan Tian Dao, should be able to impose certain restrictions on the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>But with the passage of time, after thousands of years, the Tianxuan Mirror had subtly changed compared to the Supreme Law Mirror.</p><p></p><p>By relying solely on Moru Bin, it might be a bit of a stretch.</p><p></p><p>That was also why he found Lu Xichan, possibly seeking to use the power of formations to contain the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"In the 115th life, the Xuan Tian Sealing Formation came first, and then Moru Bin was found."</p><p></p><p>"However, with my subtle manipulation, they will eventually come to the same outcome."</p><p></p><p>Watching He Zhenghao suddenly seem to have had an epiphany, Li Fan couldn't help but show a faint smile, both pleased and ecstatic.</p><p></p><p>In his view, under the Xuan Tian Sealing, the Tianxuan Mirror restrained by cultivators was obviously easier to deal with than the Tianxuan Locking, evolving into the ultimate form of the Supreme Law Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"With He Zhenghao's contributions to the formation, his position at the headquarters of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance will surely rise. By then, he can try to persuade all the talented formation masters he interacts with to join the mutual assistance society."</p><p></p><p>"As for whether it will be noticed by the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>A gleam flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph. Moru Bin knows the identity of He Zhenghao as a member of the mutual assistance society."</p><p></p><p>"With his insight, he will naturally see that this exquisite Xuan Tian Sealing Formation is definitely not something someone of He Zhenghao's caliber could come up with. He will then realize the true origin of this formation. That is me, the former Law King of Xuan Tian Dao, lending a hand in the background."</p><p></p><p>"If nothing goes wrong, he will probably actively help cover this up and may even take the background of the mutual assistance society onto himself."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes gleamed, "This is the silent understanding between brothers who once fought side by side."</p><p></p><p>"If he can act according to my intentions, then perhaps it is time for us brothers to reunite."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the premise is that I can deceive the Xuan Tian teachings from Sister Zhao."</p><p></p><p>As for what to exchange with Sister Zhao, Li Fan hadn't figured it out yet.</p><p></p><p>If it could be done without any cost, that would be best. If not, he had many things that Sister Zhao might be interested in.</p><p></p><p>He believed he could persuade her as well.</p><p></p><p>Thinking ahead, Li Fan felt quite content.</p>

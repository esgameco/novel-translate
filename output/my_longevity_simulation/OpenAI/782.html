        <h1>Chapter 782</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Xu Baicheng was sincere.</p><p></p><p>But after a moment of silence, Liu San shook his head and refused, saying, "Young master, it's better for you to go with Lao Fang. In terms of vision, he is definitely not inferior to me. In this troubled autumn, there are many disciples in Changsheng Valley who still need care. Although there is an end-time disk covering the entrance, it cannot rule out the possibility of cultivators accidentally entering."</p><p></p><p>"Lao Liu, you finally spoke the truth," Fang Zaiji seemed a bit happy about Liu San's affirmation.</p><p></p><p>But soon he looked at the other person with some suspicion, "You wouldn't, by any chance, want to take advantage of this rare opportunity to be alone with Yushan, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense!" Liu San replied angrily.</p><p></p><p>After some commotion, Xu Bai and Fang Zaiji left Changsheng Valley and headed straight to Taiyan Sect.</p><p></p><p>The entrance to the small world was located in Taihua Prefecture, and along the way, they saw many cultivators who were also attracted and went to see the excitement.</p><p></p><p>What's even more rare, along the way, there were cultivators within the Celestial Alliance system guiding the direction.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, this submission of Taiyan Sect to the Celestial Alliance was treated as a typical example and would be well publicized.</p><p></p><p>Taihua Prefecture, located in the eastern region of Wuxian Alliance, not far from the Cloud Sea.</p><p></p><p>A mountain range runs through the entire area, with thousands of towering peaks.</p><p></p><p>Among them, nine peaks are the most majestic, known as the Taihua Nine Peaks. </p><p></p><p>It used to be the Taihua Ten Peaks.</p><p></p><p>However, one of them, the Taixu Mountain, suddenly collapsed and disappeared from people's memories. Since then, it has become the Nine Peaks.</p><p></p><p>Once in a past life, He Zhenghao planned to further his studies in Taihua Prefecture, but under the intervention of Li Fan, he went to Tianyun Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Following the guidance, the two arrived at Taixuan Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"The entrance is quite hidden, actually in the middle of the mountain? Naturally formed! If it weren't for the Celestial Alliance opening this passage, it would have taken a lot of effort to enter." Fang Zaiji was somewhat amazed.</p><p></p><p>They walked along the inner passage of the mountain until they reached the end.</p><p></p><p>The spatial passage had already been solidified and opened.</p><p></p><p>There were several Taiyan Sect cultivators stationed at the entrance, seemingly queuing to welcome them. However, their eyes kept scanning the visiting cultivators, as if looking for something.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that those brats from back then are still alive?" Fang Zaiji thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Fang Zaiji suddenly hesitating, Xu Bai knew what he was worried about.</p><p></p><p>With a gentle cough as a reminder, he took the lead and walked forward.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Fang Zaiji could only follow suit.</p><p></p><p>A few Taiyan Sect cultivators, upon seeing Xu Bai walking towards them, their eyes lit up and they surrounded him.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, please stay!"</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if you are interested in joining our Taiyan Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"After joining the sect, not only will you have nothing to worry about in terms of cultivation methods, but you may even receive a middle-grade Transmutation Stone for free."</p><p></p><p>They all spoke enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>This drew the attention of other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Friend from Taiyan Sect, what about me?!"</p><p></p><p>"I want to join Taiyan Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Why are you only surrounding him? Just because he looks good?"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were somewhat dissatisfied, but the people from Taiyan Sect paid no attention to them, focusing only on Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Without agreeing or rejecting, Xu Bai instead inquired about the current relationship between the Celestial Alliance and Taiyan Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Taiyan Sect cultivators explained, "We just bear the name of the Celestial Alliance, and send elders to sit in the Alliance headquarters every year. Generally speaking, it hasn't changed much from before."</p><p></p><p>"In this Taixuan Realm, our Taiyan Sect has the final say. The Alliance does not interfere."</p><p></p><p>"Think about it, there are many caves and small worlds under the jurisdiction of the Celestial Alliance. Having one more or one less doesn't matter at all."</p><p></p><p>"It's even more convenient for our daily cultivation with the Celestial Alliance's treasures like the Tianxuan Treasure Mirror and Tianxuan Mirror."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Bai seemed a bit interested, they put more effort into persuading him.</p><p></p><p>They even took the initiative to lead him around and show him the scenery inside the "Taixuan" small world.</p><p></p><p>In this vast land, there were countless ordinary people living there.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, there was a floating city in the clouds.</p><p></p><p>You could vaguely see many cultivators shuttling in and out of the city.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual energy density in this small world is already higher than ordinary regions in the Profound Yellow Realm."</p><p></p><p>"You were able to find such a good place of refuge back then..." Fang Zaiji envied slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Taiyan Sect cultivators collectively paused.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, we excel in divination. Naturally, we could find a ray of hope in the midst of an apocalypse."</p><p></p><p>In fact, when looking at the young disciples' ages, they might not fully understand what had happened back then.</p><p></p><p>They were just exaggerating to convince Xu Bai to join the sect.</p><p></p><p>"According to reason, with such excellent conditions for recruiting disciples in Taiyan Sect, you shouldn't be short of people. So why, when you see me, do you..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai deliberately asked, "Could it be because I look good?"</p><p></p><p>The Taiyan Sect cultivators glanced at each other, and finally, an older cultivator answered Xu Bai's question.</p><p></p><p>"Our Taiyan Sect doesn't accept just anyone. The main thing is to meet several aspects provided by the 'Transmutation Stone Mother.'"</p><p></p><p>After briefly explaining the "Transmutation Stone Mother," he continued, "For cultivators who meet the aspects, in the divination of the stone mother, they are either the backbone of the sect in the future, or they are the mainstay to revive the Taiyan Sect, or they are the unmatched leader who can lead the Taiyan Sect out of crisis."</p><p></p><p>"In short, it's all benefit and no harm. We never make mistakes!"</p><p></p><p>They assured, apparently trusting the results of the "Transmutation Stone Mother's" divination.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? This Stone Mother is so miraculous? I wonder if I can see it in person?" Xu Bai asked following their words.</p><p></p><p>"As long as you join our Taiyan Sect, you will be able to personally meet the Stone Mother. And it is very likely that you will also have a chance to 'simulate'!" the middle-aged cultivator guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>"Simulate?" Xu Bai narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Even Fang Zaiji was momentarily drawn in.</p><p></p><p>"As I mentioned before, within the Transmutation Stone Mother, there is a near-realistic divination world. And if permitted, you can use its power to create a virtual world tailored for you."</p><p></p><p>"In this virtual world, you will experience everything that is about to happen."</p><p></p><p>"Although it cannot be one hundred percent accurate, being forewarned is forearmed, enough to save you from many detours."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged cultivator's tone was full of envy.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I failed the test last time and missed such a rare opportunity in a hundred years."</p>

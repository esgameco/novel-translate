            <p>However, if the divine clone Xu Bai were to enter, it might attract the attention of Mr. Bai existing in the Meteor Immortal Realm...</p><p></p><p>But the result was destined to be unpredictable.</p><p></p><p>Having experienced too much as Li Fan since crossing over, he was no longer easily convinced of anything. Even if he saw it with his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>Especially when it concerned his life.</p><p></p><p>After much contemplation, Xu Bai ultimately suppressed the inexplicable urge to explore the Meteor Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"How strange, one must be cautious." Xu Bai's expression was inscrutable.</p><p></p><p>This body was refined from Xu Ke's essence and Mr. Bai's aura.</p><p></p><p>Just by absorbing a bit of his aura, Xu Bai exhibited strange phenomena, including but not limited to "blessed by heaven and earth, extraordinary talents," "often feeling empathy," and "occasionally having uncontrollable thoughts." </p><p></p><p>These various occurrences were enough to demonstrate Mr. Bai's power, making Li Fan inevitably vigilant.</p><p></p><p>If the effects were limited to just the divine clone, it would be fine. </p><p></p><p>What truly concerned Li Fan was if these changes through the connection between the divine clone and the original body would subtly influence the original body.</p><p></p><p>By then, would he still be himself?</p><p></p><p>Even if he was, could he rid himself of this "contamination"?</p><p></p><p>Indeed, to Li Fan, this insidious transformation of his original nature was definitely a form of contamination that he could never accept.</p><p></p><p>"If there is even a trace of influence on the original body, I must return immediately," Xu Bai decided silently.</p><p></p><p>Calming his mind, Xu Bai resumed his usual expression and left the Longevity Valley.</p><p></p><p>Returning to Tianliang Prefecture, he continued handling various matters related to the communication array.</p><p></p><p>Since the start of the expedition to the small worlds, he had taken on an additional responsibility.</p><p></p><p>That was to monitor the number of discovered caves and small worlds within the realm, and then coordinate the cultivators to conquer them.</p><p></p><p>The fundamental reason behind this was that all unknown small worlds in the world actually represented a substantial amount of merits and contributions for cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Except for special circumstances, they wouldn't choose to share them with others.</p><p></p><p>Normally, they would choose to share them first with relatives and friends.</p><p></p><p>Only when the force in the small world was too formidable and their group couldn't handle it, they would reluctantly share with others.</p><p></p><p>The expected scenario of the Ten Immortals Alliance was that upon discovering the entrance to a small world, they would openly share information with other cultivators, which was indeed a rare occurrence.</p><p></p><p>Because after such a long time had passed, the cultivators had gradually realized this.</p><p></p><p>The conquest of small worlds was an irreplaceable resource, likely the only way to rapidly accumulate merits and contributions in their lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, they needed to be careful and maximize their benefits.</p><p></p><p>So after the initial rapid expansion, the progress of conquering the myriad realms had slowed down significantly.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Immortals Alliance naturally understood the reason for this phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>Hence Xu Bai's newly added task and responsibility.</p><p></p><p>Although there were no mandatory measures, he still held an official position in the Ten Immortals Alliance. Often, his participation would promote collaboration among various groups.</p><p></p><p>Thus, there was no resistance, and after his reputation spread, cultivators would actively seek his help.</p><p></p><p>The more he interacted with them, Xu Bai more or less understood their demands.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, they could share the information about the entrance to the small world they held with others. However, in return, the cultivators benefiting from this discovery would have to prioritize them if they needed help in the future when encountering other small worlds.</p><p></p><p>It was a mutual aid pact.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, conquering small worlds was not as easy as eating and drinking but required constant exposure to bloodshed, where a slight mistake could lead to death on the spot. Therefore, the companions had to be trustworthy. Regardless of life or death, they couldn't stab each other in the back.</p><p></p><p>Thirdly, why let outsiders benefit from their work? If possible, the small worlds in Tianliang Prefecture should be handled by local cultivators.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai believed that he understood human nature after countless reincarnations. But when facing these sinister cultivators, he still felt somewhat overwhelmed.</p><p></p><p>Contrary to their seemingly friendly appearance recommended by him, only a few of them would return in the end.</p><p></p><p>They would remain silent about the fallen cultivators in the team, instead blaming each other.</p><p></p><p>But when Xu Bai contacted them again for another team-up, asking if they could join forces for the conquest, most of them would agree.</p><p></p><p>Because even though they knew about each other's shady activities, at least they knew some details about each other.</p><p></p><p>Compared to completely unknown and unfamiliar companions, they were more trustworthy.</p><p></p><p>"Truly, human nature is profound and difficult to fathom."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai shook his head in amazement.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the names of cultivators were like chess pieces, arranged differently based on their personalities and abilities.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai was trying to figure out the best way to utilize the power of Tianliang Prefecture's cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Inwardly, Xu Bai thought, "Currently, Tianling Prefecture has discovered a total of thirteen small worlds. One of them is extremely dangerous, with no survivors in several attempts, and has been temporarily abandoned. The other twelve have been completely cleared..."</p><p></p><p>After the alliance cultivators completely destroyed the resistance in the small worlds and scanned them with the Tianxuan Treasure Mirror, a team of black-robed cultivators would be dispatched by the alliance headquarters to take over, expel unauthorized personnel, and seal the entrance while conducting unknown activities inside.</p><p></p><p>Even after inquiring with Nangong Shirong, Xu Bai couldn't learn much about it.</p><p></p><p>However, according to feedback from many of his subordinates, shortly after being taken over by the black-robed cultivators, the entrances to these small worlds vanished inexplicably.</p><p></p><p>Although the locations were still marked on the map of the Tianxuan Treasure Mirror, they couldn't find the actual entrances when they were physically there.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that they were concealed in some way, the entrances themselves have changed."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, the entrances are still there, but they seem to have been encrypted in such a way that they can't be found using conventional methods."</p><p></p><p>After exploring on-site, Xu Bai reached this conclusion.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While Xu Bai was busy in Tianliang Prefecture, the original Li Fan finally bid farewell to the passionate Shuo Feng and left his mansion.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan had gained a lot from these days of entanglement and sparring, he was more amazed by the progress of Shuo Feng.</p><p></p><p>Starting from being completely defenseless against the "Death by a Thousand Cuts" technique, he could only rely on his somewhat bizarre constitution to resist.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 933</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan hesitated for a moment. These were indeed authentic immortal techniques, but...</p><p></p><p>A hint of gloom flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>During the illusion he experienced with Senior Sister Zhao, he had practiced two techniques, "Exchange Tax for Heaven and Earth" and "Divine Soul-Severing Technique."</p><p></p><p>Apart from the characteristics of the techniques themselves, they had a unique common point.</p><p></p><p>Once cultivated, they could never be abolished.</p><p></p><p>Even with the secret methods of the Supreme Sect or the Original Scriptures of the Highest Origin, it was the same.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there was an even more lethal point.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that all the techniques of the Mysterious Heaven Sect bore a special mark. True experts, no matter how well hidden, could be discerned by those in the know with a single glance.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, there was a secret technique in the Mysterious Heaven Sect called "Replacing Heaven with Oneself," which not only could completely strip away techniques and cultivation, but could also transfer the realms and powers obtained from cultivating Mysterious Heaven Sect techniques, like transferring branches from one tree to another.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he was just an ordinary cultivator who had mistakenly entered the illusion. Senior Sister Zhao had no need to deliberately alter information about the Mysterious Heaven Sect.</p><p></p><p>So it could be basically assumed to be true.</p><p></p><p>The strange thing lay here.</p><p></p><p>Because Li Fan did not find any relevant memories in the soul fragments of Ji Yuzheng.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the near-perfect persona displayed by the Mysterious Heaven King...</p><p></p><p>It made Li Fan's heart grow cold.</p><p></p><p>This was also one of the major reasons why Li Fan always had doubts about the "good person" identity of the Mysterious Heaven King.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this could also be because Ji Yuzheng's soul was not intact. Hence, some memories were lost.</p><p></p><p>But regardless, Li Fan had to remain vigilant against these techniques of the Mysterious Heaven Sect.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was not a rare book he had personally acquired. It was passed down by the Mysterious Heaven King and then passed on by Senior Sister Zhao.</p><p></p><p>With their cultivation levels, if they tampered with the techniques, Li Fan would not be able to detect it at all.</p><p></p><p>"My goal is just to pretend to be a bit like them."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment and then came up with an idea.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I can use the method of derivation, to derive a technique that looks similar on the outside but is different at its core."</p><p></p><p>"This might be risky. But I can use the method of Saintly Blood Rebirth to create a clone to experiment with."</p><p></p><p>"If I fail, I can only take the risk myself."</p><p></p><p>"But after that, my cultivation cannot be preserved."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's decision seemed a bit exaggerated, but he knew well that when dealing with the old monsters of the Mysterious Yellow Realm, being cautious was never excessive.</p><p></p><p>A slight mistake could potentially sow the seeds leading to ultimate failure.</p><p></p><p>Of course, regardless, this trip to the Daoist Sect would definitely yield great rewards.</p><p></p><p>Even though he could not currently release his cultivation, firstly, these immortal techniques broadened Li Fan's horizons, letting him realize that techniques could be so mystical.</p><p></p><p>Secondly...</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan's strength gradually grew in the future, and the secrets of the Mysterious Heaven Sect were gradually revealed, these techniques could truly become the nourishment for his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he temporarily stored these techniques in the depths of his mind.</p><p></p><p>According to the plan, Li Fan directly activated the method of Saintly Blood Rebirth.</p><p></p><p>The materials needed were left over from his last search in the Imperial City. In no time, a body extremely similar to Li Fan appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>The clone Li Qing didn't have any memories of the Saintly Blood Rebirth. A hint of amazement flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>As usual, Li Fan modified the memories and soul of the clone regarding the Saintly Rebirth.</p><p></p><p>With his previous experience, his actions became more skilled and fluent.</p><p></p><p>In no time, the Saintly Rebirth Li Fan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The biggest weakness of the Saintly Blood Rebirth was that the reborn body was simply an ordinary physique without any cultivation. One had to start cultivating from scratch.</p><p></p><p>Unless one had the astounding talent like Mr. Bai, it would seem quite useless.</p><p></p><p>However, in this world, with the existence of the Faceless Stone Statue, Li Fan could easily solve this drawback.</p><p></p><p>Grabbing the clone, Li Fan flashed to the side of the Faceless Stone Statue.</p><p></p><p>As usual, numerous scenes rushed in like a tide.</p><p></p><p>However, the most intense and sincere among them was no longer Su Yuqing.</p><p></p><p>It had turned into He Zhenghao!</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was praying continuously in his heart, very devoutly.</p><p></p><p>Based on the flashing scenes, Li Fan instantly understood the recent events that had happened to him.</p><p></p><p>As he had expected, that day, he had transmitted the contents of the Mysterious Heaven Sealing Array to He Zhenghao's mind using the Faceless Stone Statue.</p><p></p><p>At the main headquarters of the Ten Immortal Alliance Formation Hall, after He Zhenghao casually mentioned various speculations about the Mysterious Heaven Sealing Array, it immediately attracted great attention.</p><p></p><p>He himself was also treated as a rare genius in the formation path, and his treatment and situation suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao kept explaining all the inspirations that occasionally appeared in his mind in the hope of gaining a higher position.</p><p></p><p>However, problems began to arise.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's talent in the formation path was good, but there was still a significant gap in deriving the Mysterious Heaven Sealing Array on his own.</p><p></p><p>Even if he knew the complete structure of the formation diagram, he still didn't fully understand the true essence of the formation technique.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was somewhat cunning, not completely divulging all the information.</p><p></p><p>He only occasionally improved some aspects and tried to delay as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to take the opportunity to study the Mysterious Heaven Sealing Array on his own.</p><p></p><p>But as the days went by, the progress of He Zhenghao, who was advancing very slowly, was finally awakened to reality.</p><p></p><p>The chasm between him and the Mysterious Heaven Sealing Array was too vast and deep.</p><p></p><p>He realized that it was impossible for him to truly understand the essence of the formation on his own.</p><p></p><p>So he placed his only hope on the "Compassionate True Immortal of the Mortal World."</p><p></p><p>Every day, it seemed like he was working hard to derive the formation, but in reality, his mind was constantly repeating prayers.</p><p></p><p>His devotion exceeded that of all the members of the alliance.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who understood the situation, shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>However, since He Zhenghao was someone he was more familiar with, and drawing attention from Mo Rubin required using him as a pawn, Li Fan decided not to turn a blind eye.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, a large amount of annotations and discussions on the Mysterious Heaven Sealing Array were continuously transmitted to He Zhenghao's mind.</p><p></p><p>The impact of the data was so huge that He Zhenghao found it difficult to bear and gradually fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing noteworthy among the other believers, and the Saintly Rebirth Li Fan looked towards the Faceless Deity.</p><p></p><p>Like the other members of the alliance, he began to pray sincerely.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Li Fan felt a mysterious connection being established through the Faceless Deity, transferring a large amount of cultivation into the body of the Saintly Rebirth.</p>

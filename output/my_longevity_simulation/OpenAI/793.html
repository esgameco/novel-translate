        <div class="content">
            <p>The replacement was a glimpse of determination in the eyes.</p><p></p><p>As the two eyes gazed, the once rampaging and extremely vicious Emperor Beast suddenly stopped in midair.</p><p></p><p>Then, its body seemed to be roasted by invisible flames.</p><p></p><p>Melting, disappearing.</p><p></p><p>One by one, hollow spaces appeared.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor Beast let out a sharp and crazy howl.</p><p></p><p>But Mr. Bai's face showed no hint of mercy.</p><p></p><p>His gaze grew deeper, and the fierce invisible flames, like torture, continued to torment the Emperor Beast.</p><p></p><p>In the Valley of Longevity, the people who witnessed this scene were shivering.</p><p></p><p>Although the vast majority of them were unclear about Mr. Bai's strength and realm.</p><p></p><p>But the terrifying beast released from the smelting furnace, the dreadful pressure emanating from it was felt by everyone.</p><p></p><p>Even a cultivator of the Dao was afraid of it, let alone face it.</p><p></p><p>Yet, in front of Mr. Bai, this terrifying monster had no resistance at all.</p><p></p><p>It could only allow itself to be slowly tortured, dissipated into the world.</p><p></p><p>Having personally refined the Emperor Beast, Li Fan had a clear understanding of its strength.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not expect the Emperor Beast to pose any hindrance to Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>In reality, similar to before.</p><p></p><p>The monster was just a decoy.</p><p></p><p>It was not in the Yellow Realm, but hidden within the Valley of Longevity.</p><p></p><p>Hence, Senior Brother Zhang's grand vow Dharma body was somewhat delayed.</p><p></p><p>Not until the Emperor Beast had been reduced to one-tenth of its original size through refining, did a purple aura gracefully arrive.</p><p></p><p>The purple radiance blossomed into a tall figure towering into the sky. [newline]Ignoring everyone present, it only stared at the Emperor Beast restrained by Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Sky Divine Thunder condensed into a long spear, abruptly piercing down.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai watched the Dharma image in the sky but did not stop Senior Brother Zhang's actions.</p><p></p><p>However, at the moment when the Emperor Beast was struck by the purple divine thunder.</p><p></p><p>The remaining part of the Emperor Beast voluntarily burst open.</p><p></p><p>An extremely dense, even somewhat terrifying blood mist, along with the explosion, instantly spread in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Even the Purple Sky Divine Thunder, capable of purging all evil spirits, was overshadowed by it.</p><p></p><p>And Mr. Bai, after a moment of daze, for the first time, showed signs of anger.</p><p></p><p>Just because...</p><p></p><p>In the process of refining the Emperor Beast originally, Li Fan added a touch of seasoning.</p><p></p><p>It was collected in a certain era, and had been existing in the "Return to Reality" space ever since, the "Blood Essence of Ten Thousand People".</p><p></p><p>The power of the elixir erupted abruptly, even Mr. Bai had to temporarily avoid its edge.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>In the underground chamber, Li Fan suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's time!"</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the chaotic word puppets buried all over the Yellow Realm were detonated by Li Fan, one-third of them.</p><p></p><p>An unknown and terrifying aura burst forth shortly thereafter from various places.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the cultivators in the Yellow Realm felt a sense of impending disaster.</p><p></p><p>Panic and inexplicable fear, accelerated heartbeats.</p><p></p><p>But they couldn't explain the reason.</p><p></p><p>More and more vast divine senses swept through the Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Attempting to find the source of these disturbances.</p><p></p><p>The sky also changed its color.</p><p></p><p>As if something was getting closer to spy.</p><p></p><p>The impact brought by the chaotic word technique was even better than Li Fan had anticipated.</p><p></p><p>Although scattered all over, when they all exploded together, they seemed to have a spontaneous connection.</p><p></p><p>Without deliberate writing, a huge "chaos" character was twisted and formed on the ground of the Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>While various strange events gradually occurred in different regions, Li Fan's objective was also achieved.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai was the incarnation of the Yellow Heaven Dao.</p><p></p><p>His power also came from the Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, as the Yellow Realm was influenced by the chaotic word technique, it fell into turmoil for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai's actions also experienced a brief moment of stiffness.</p><p></p><p>And this was exactly where Li Fan had been waiting for so long, the only possible opportunity.</p><p></p><p>So, at this moment, all of his preparations burst into action at once.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, his doppelganger Xu Bai appeared in front of Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>The two of them locked eyes, gazing at each other's extremely similar faces.</p><p></p><p>There was no need for many words.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's doppelganger, without any hesitation, in an instant, his own paradise ruptured with a resounding crash.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai, sacrificed himself!</p><p></p><p>Although the doppelganger born from the birth of the holy blood would not be affected by the death of the original body, they were still connected in a mysterious way.</p><p></p><p>The demise of the original body would inevitably have some slight influences on the doppelganger, which could not be eradicated.</p><p></p><p>It was a natural restriction of the Holy Blood Embryo Law.</p><p></p><p>Even with Mr. Bai's current cultivation level, it was still unavoidable.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Mr. Bai's stiffness was prolonged once again.</p><p></p><p>After the disappearance of the doppelganger Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan instantly felt that the connection between Mr. Bai and him had been severed to some extent.</p><p></p><p>Testing it, although he could open the interface of "Return to Reality," he still couldn't confirm the truth.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan began his next actions.</p><p></p><p>With a step, he left the secret chamber for cultivation in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The power of "chaos" instantly enveloped the Valley of Longevity.</p><p></p><p>The sky was obscured by a hazy force.</p><p></p><p>Chaos descended.</p><p></p><p>Like bamboo shoots after the rain, suddenly, hundreds of yellow withered branches sprouted from the ground in the Valley of Longevity.</p><p></p><p>After a flash of light, these withered branches all turned into human figures.</p><p></p><p>Their faces, surprisingly, were all identical to Li Fan!</p><p></p><p>They all grinned eerily at the people present, and then quickly receded back into the ground, disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Including everyone, even Mr. Bai, all were attracted by this scene.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a greater disturbance swept in.</p><p></p><p>The remaining two-thirds of the chaotic puppet words were detonated in unison, causing a commotion.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai's body once again stiffened.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, unnoticed by anyone.</p><p></p><p>A jet-black small cauldron shot into the sky.</p><p></p><p>It was about to break through the secret realm and fly towards the sky of the Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>No matter how hidden the actions were, with many eyes around, someone still noticed the departure of the Medicine King True Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>A cry of surprise drew everyone's attention.</p><p></p><p>But soon, their faces turned even more grim.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, beneath the Medicine King True Cauldron, countless figures were thrown away like rubbish, vigorously tossed in different directions.</p><p></p><p>Li San's body trembled violently, his color suddenly changing.</p><p></p><p>Because he had already seen that these were all Medicine King sect cultivators in slumber within the True Cauldron!</p><p></p><p>They were all old sect practitioners, frail in body.</p><p></p><p>And still in slumber.</p><p></p><p>Thrown at such a fast speed, if they were to hit the ground like that, except for a few with strong abilities, the rest would likely either die or be severely injured!</p><p></p><p>"Save them!"</p><p></p><p>Disciples of the Medicine King Sect reacted one after another.</p><p></p><p>But the number of dropped cultivators was too high, and they flew in different directions.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, due to the influence of the chaotic words, it was somewhat difficult for the cultivators in the Valley of Longevity to fly on their own, risking a fall.</p><p></p><p>With no time to spare, let alone rescue.</p><p></p><p>Li San's eyes were bloodshot, and even with all his efforts, he only managed to save a dozen or so.</p><p></p><p>Just as he began to feel somewhat desperate.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai, who had already returned to normal from his stiffness, reached out his hand.</p><p></p><p>He caught all the fallen cultivators, gently placing them on the ground.</p><p></p><p>While the influence of the chaotic words had not yet dissipated, Mr. Bai, who had done all of this, strangely twisted his right elbow, as if it had been broken.</p><p></p><p>Although he quickly returned to normal, it still made him furrow his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for saving us, Senior!" After confirming that none of the fellow disciples of the sect were in mortal danger, Li San looked around and then flew forward, expressing his gratitude with clasped hands.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai did not speak, only looking at the Medicine King True Cauldron, which had disappeared into the sky, and the hundreds of puppets that had already fled to distant lands, as well as the body of Li Fan lying lifeless on the ground, having lost his life force.</p>

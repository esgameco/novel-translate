        <h1>Chapter 800</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the mind of the sacred fetus Li Fan, the desire for "hunger" reached its peak.</p><p></p><p>Since he was "hungry," he had to eat!</p><p></p><p>Every part of his body seemed to give birth to its own consciousness.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to endlessly swallow everything around him to alleviate the "hunger" he felt inside.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan's own thoughts were completely occupied.</p><p></p><p>This led to...</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the sacred fetus Li Bai seemed to burst like a punctured ball.</p><p></p><p>With a bang, he quickly shrank into a tiny particle amidst mutual devouring.</p><p></p><p>And then completely disappeared from the world.</p><p></p><p>Yet his thoughts remained in that moment when he saw the remains of the immortal tomb open their eyes.</p><p></p><p>If this process were to be explained in simple terms, it would be that the mortal body of Li Fan could not bear the pressure from the remains of the immortal tomb and instantly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even if the limitations of the "mortal body" were removed, the results would not be favorable even if the original infant state was present.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators, especially those below the realm of immortality, were incomparable to immortals. The difference was so great that it could not be described in words.</p><p></p><p>And with the disappearance of the sacred fetus Li Fan, it was expected that the events that followed in this life would only be revealed after the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>The objects transformed by Li Fan, trapped within Gu Xinghan's coffin, would automatically return.</p><p></p><p>However, everything within the immortal tomb...</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the humanoid remains bound by dark red chains or the inscription of "[Hunger]" on the wild earth, they were all beings that could not be speculated upon with "common sense."</p><p></p><p>The sacred fetus created by the improved method of blood sanctification was an independent entity compared to the original, yet it also possessed a "synchronous feeling."</p><p></p><p>Even if the original being had fallen, this synchronous feeling still crossed time and space, maintaining a connection to the original's transformed form.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary cultivators could not perceive this relationship. Even the most powerful figures in the Xuanhuang realm, the immortal emperors of the realm of immortality, may not be able to discover it.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Within the immortal tomb was a being known as "Immortal."</p><p></p><p>Therefore, through the connection in the immortal tomb, her gaze transcended time and space, reaching beyond the Xuanhuang realm!</p><p></p><p>An extremely terrifying suction force descended as a result.</p><p></p><p>The entire realm of beasts instantly collapsed into a black singularity.</p><p></p><p>Everything within it plummeted and vanished.</p><p></p><p>The scope of the suction force then spread to the Valley of Eternity.</p><p></p><p>After over two hundred years of development, the Medicine King Sect was now flourishing.</p><p></p><p>Ten Harmonious Daoists, seventy-six Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p></p><p>There were countless Golden Core and Yuan Infant cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the peak of ancient times, the strength had grown even further.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, all these "great cultivators"...</p><p></p><p>Liu San, Fang Zaiji, Jiang Yushan...</p><p></p><p>And others. They all had no resistance, not even time to react, and disappeared into the black singularity.</p><p></p><p>Having devoured two small worlds, the black singularity was not satisfied and expanded even more rapidly.</p><p></p><p>A black sphere capable of swallowing everything appeared in the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>The true apocalypse had arrived.</p><p></p><p>At the moment of the black singularity's birth, the protection energy progress of Li Fan's transformed entity instantly plummeted, almost resetting itself in an instant.</p><p></p><p>If it were Li Fan himself present, he might have ended up similar to the other sacrificed cultivators, lacking the speed to activate "True Rebirth" in time.</p><p></p><p>But what was different this time was...</p><p></p><p>After activating True Rebirth, the surroundings did not immediately blur.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they entered an extremely peculiar state.</p><p></p><p>Outside of True Rebirth was pitch black, forming a circular area.</p><p></p><p>Beyond the area, scenes of destruction in the Xuanhuang realm rapidly flashed.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that someone was issuing a thunderous roar, trying to stop the black sphere's devouring spree.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like a decaying spire pierced the sky, appearing on the celestial stage, accompanied by a mad laughter: "Death to all! Yes, death to all!"</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if two intersecting beams instantly scanned the disappearing Xuanhuang realm and then vanished into the endless void beyond the Xuanhuang realm.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like numerous cultivators were staring in horror at the black sun rising in the sky, despairing and awaiting death.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The scenes grew faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they were completely engulfed in darkness.</p><p></p><p>And then...</p><p></p><p>A brilliant silver light burst outward from the black domain of True Rebirth.</p><p></p><p>Anchor for 1 year.</p><p></p><p>Disintegration of the mountain peak!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan at the mid-stage of Golden Core suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were blood-red, resembling a wild beast!</p><p></p><p>Hungry! Hungry! Hungry! Hungry! Hungry!</p><p></p><p>An endless hunger filled his mind, almost driving him to lose his sanity in an instant.</p><p></p><p>He was too hungry.</p><p></p><p>He urgently wanted to stuff everything in his field of vision into his stomach.</p><p></p><p>Rudely smashing the wooden bed beneath him, he gulped it down like a whale swallowing water.</p><p></p><p>But the hunger did not diminish at all.</p><p></p><p>A strong sense of crisis suddenly arose in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>If he continued to be dominated by this hunger, the likely outcome for him would be complete annihilation.</p><p></p><p>It was worth noting that True Rebirth was not yet fully charged, and he did not have the chance to start anew!</p><p></p><p>Seizing the moment when his rationality was dominant, Li Fan glanced at the panel of True Rebirth.</p><p></p><p>In the column of techniques, he saw the words "Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Incantation."</p><p></p><p>So he silently activated it.</p><p></p><p>Endure the calamities of a thousand lifetimes, yet the immortal heart remains unchanged!</p><p></p><p>Although the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Incantation did not weaken the effect of "Hunger," it helped Li Fan maintain clarity of mind.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to become a mere monster driven solely by the urge to devour everything.</p><p></p><p>As the Immortal Heart Incantation reached its peak, it resisted the endless hunger.</p><p></p><p>Although it could preserve his life, the price was akin to enduring torment in the depths of hell.</p><p></p><p>For eight years, Li Fan was forced to struggle against the hunger while stranded at the mountain peak of disintegration.</p><p></p><p>Even when the progress reached six years, True Rebirth had already completed its charge without him noticing.</p><p></p><p>"Eight years have passed. This hunger shows no signs of weakening at all."</p><p></p><p>A hint of determination flashed in Li Fan's eyes, now resembling that of a crazed beast.</p><p></p><p>He first looked at the prompt, which had existed for quite some time.</p><p></p><p>["End of the current simulation"]</p><p></p><p>[You can choose one of the following options to retain:</p><p></p><p>- An item you possess from the current simulation.</p><p>- Your cultivation realm from the current simulation.</p><p>- The simulated memory of a person closely related to you during the simulation. This memory can be inherited by that person.</p><p></p><p>Or, you can speed up the charging progress by giving up the above choices.]</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, he chose the first option.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, an item called the "End-of-World Disintegration Disc" appeared in the storage space of True Rebirth.</p><p></p><p>"True Rebirth!" Li Fan called out once more.</p><p></p><p>"Whether to virtualize the current scene and return to the established anchor point," the prompt from True Rebirth sounded timely.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan decisively chose "yes."</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the scene at the disintegration mountain peak regained its illusionary state.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>There will be another chapter later, and today's ending here with two chapters.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 953</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>There was inevitably some surprise in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Under the pressure of the total destruction of their country and people, this group from the empire indeed displayed unimaginable potential.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had never expected that they could create such a perfect device.</p><p></p><p>Even with Li Fan's current critical eye, it was very difficult to find any flaws in this device.</p><p></p><p>"These alien beasts and the hourglass device still do not have names."</p><p></p><p>"Please bestow a name, senior."</p><p></p><p>After Qing finished speaking, she gestured with her eyes. The empress bowed and then softly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..." Li Fan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Even though he knew the other party's intentions, Li Fan was still genuinely pleased at this moment.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan had an answer in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"So it is said, in the beginning of heaven and earth, there was the division of yin and yang."</p><p></p><p>"When yin and yang merge, all things evolve."</p><p></p><p>"And it is also said, the way gives birth to one, one gives birth to two, two gives birth to three, and three gives birth to all things..."</p><p></p><p>"This alien beast can be named Dao Yi Worm."</p><p></p><p>"As for this device..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan paused slightly, then proclaimed loudly, "It can be named Heaven and Earth Oven!"</p><p></p><p>The three empresses of the empire looked at each other, showing nothing but delight in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the name, senior!" they said in unison.</p><p></p><p>Next, Li Fan learned more details about the Heaven and Earth Oven.</p><p></p><p>The forging of the oven itself was not a difficult task.</p><p></p><p>With enough resources, producing tens of thousands of cauldrons per day was a trivial matter.</p><p></p><p>Simply guide a portion of the Dao Yi Worms to a new empty oven, infuse nutrients, and wait for ten days.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven and Earth Oven could then continuously produce spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"The only possible danger is that during the self-replication process of the Dao Yi Worms, mutations may occur."</p><p></p><p>"The probability of mutation is very small, and the direction is also uncertain. However, no matter what, it will cause a malfunction in the Heaven and Earth Oven."</p><p></p><p>"And because the Dao Yi Worms have been selectively cultivated to an extremely simplified structure now, they are not competitive compared to any other variant. So they will always be replaced by those new mutated forms."</p><p></p><p>"To ensure that the Dao Yi Worms always maintain the best state of spiritual energy production, immediate thorough extermination must be carried out upon detecting any mutant individual in the oven."</p><p></p><p>"It is also recommended to make backups and cultivate the original forms of the Dao Yi Worms more. This is to prevent large-scale mutations and extinction events."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>It had to be said that nothing in the world was perfect.</p><p></p><p>Even after hundreds of generations of improvements, these shortcomings of the Dao Yi Worms could not be eliminated.</p><p></p><p>But then again, compared to the benefits they brought, these shortcomings were almost negligible.</p><p></p><p>It was just a matter of replacing the Heaven and Earth Oven every period of time.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, it can't even be considered a flaw."</p><p></p><p>"Seal the oven with secret techniques, making it impossible for outsiders to open. Every period of time, the oven will malfunction. To use it again, a new oven must be found..."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this the perfect means of control?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if it is extended to the various celestial small worlds, it can greatly reduce the risk of losing control."</p><p></p><p>In a flash, Li Fan deduced various possible results, and his joy increased in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But there was no hint of it on his face.</p><p></p><p>After collecting several Heavenly Ovens, Li Fan looked at the three empresses of the empire.</p><p></p><p>After a suffocating silence.</p><p></p><p>"Very good!"</p><p></p><p>"I am very satisfied with your performance this time!"</p><p></p><p>"Our Multiverse Union has always been clear in rewarding and punishing. How can you not be rewarded for your great achievements this time?"</p><p></p><p>"From today, your empire will officially become a member of the Multiverse Union."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, a virtual image of a faceless stone statue appeared in front of the three empresses.</p><p></p><p>After leading them to swear in front of the completed statue, Li Fan taught them the method of "God's Presence".</p><p></p><p>"With the protection of the demon gods, you can deal with various crises that may arise in your empire."</p><p></p><p>All three empresses had outstanding talents, and under Li Fan's witness, they each summoned their own spiritual demons shortly after.</p><p></p><p>"This is just a basic reward. After I return and report the harvest of this time, the Union will have many more rewards to offer."</p><p></p><p>"These rewards include but are not limited to the improvement of your cultivation, support for the empire's resources, and more."</p><p></p><p>"If possible, you will also have the opportunity to visit the Union headquarters."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan painted a rosy picture.</p><p></p><p>"Also, as the world that developed the Heaven and Earth Oven, the Union allows you to first popularize it in your world. And when the Heaven and Earth Oven is placed in other worlds, you will also receive corresponding rewards and shares."</p><p></p><p>"These rewards will be settled every ten years. They will be sent here in a unified manner."</p><p></p><p>"Although the proportion will not be too large, it is definitely enough to upgrade your small world here."</p><p></p><p>This was an unexpected harvest, and the three members of the empire were delighted.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, our Union never mistreats its own people."</p><p></p><p>"Anyone who contributes to the Union will receive a thousandfold and more rewards."</p><p></p><p>To prove this, Li Fan handed a storage ring to the three empresses.</p><p></p><p>When Qing saw the resources contained in the storage ring, she couldn't help but be amazed.</p><p></p><p>She quickly bowed to thank Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan waved his hand, indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"Your performance this time exceeded my expectations."</p><p></p><p>"Next, I have a task for you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took out the Celestial Patrol Arrow, which had its surface formation erased and only the core dormant creature left, from the storage ring.</p><p></p><p>"See if you can study the characteristics of this beast and realize its large-scale breeding."</p><p></p><p>"If you can achieve this, the Union will reward greatly!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Both his expression and tone revealed his seriousness towards this object.</p><p></p><p>Qing solemnly took the Celestial Patrol Arrow, observed it for a while, and showed a look of surprise.</p><p></p><p>But soon she declared, "I will not disappoint you, senior!"</p><p></p><p>After giving some related instructions, Li Fan left a jade token for communication and quietly left the small world of the empire.</p><p></p><p>In the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>Empress Hong frowned slightly as she looked at Qing, "Qing, this thing seems a bit familiar?"</p><p></p><p>Qing shook her head, "It does indeed resemble something from the sect in the past. But we cannot confirm yet. It needs further research."</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Empress Hong asked, "What do you think of the Multiverse Union?"</p><p></p><p>"Fish for the knife, what can we do? We can only take it step by step and see how it goes."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, judging by their performance so far, they are not evil-doers."</p><p></p><p>The imperial palace fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>As if remembering something, Qing suddenly said, "By the way, the demon gods bestowed by the senior..."</p><p></p><p>"Do not use them unless absolutely necessary."</p><p></p><p>"I always feel something is amiss."</p><p></p><p>Empress Hong and the empresses all nodded silently.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had returned to the Xuanhuang Realm and sensed the conversation of the several women through the thought of the demon gods' incarnation.</p>

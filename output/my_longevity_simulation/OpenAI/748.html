            <p>"There is diversity."</p><p></p><p>"Just like how your Empire can manipulate exotic beasts in battle. Over these years, other small worlds have also developed different and peculiar abilities."</p><p></p><p>"Even though it may be slightly inferior to the immortal arts of the mysterious yellow realm. However, if we can concentrate all our strength and integrate the strengths of all worlds, we might be able to summarize and research a system that can counteract the immortal arts."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai spoke confidently.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing's immediate reaction was shaking her head.</p><p></p><p>However, before she could speak, Xu Bai interrupted, solemnly saying, "As the saying goes, where there is a will, there is a way. Everyone knows that the hope is somewhat faint, but at this juncture, we can only fight to the death."</p><p></p><p>"Living under the rule of immortal cultivators, what kind of days do ordinary people live, I believe fellow Daoists should be clearer on this, right?"</p><p></p><p>"The members of the Union of Ten Thousand Realms each govern one realm. Even if we die, I'm afraid we won't be willing to live a life as cattle and horses."</p><p></p><p>"The unity of the Ten Thousand Realms is the trend. Those who are unwilling..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's expression instantly turned dark, "Although we won't engage in armed conflict with you, it's impossible for us to provide protection for you anymore."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing softly said, "Fellow Daoist, no need to worry too much. Our Empire will never lean towards the side of the mysterious yellow. But, matters of the Empire are not something I can decide with just a word."</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, please wait here for a moment. I need to discuss with Her Majesty the Empress and the Imperial Council. new 69 book â†’69shux.com"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Xu Bai nodded in understanding.</p><p></p><p>Yet at the same time, he also made his own request, "I have heard that the Empire is built on the corpse of a three-headed divine bird."</p><p></p><p>"And the head of the divine bird was cut off by a sword of an immortal in the past."</p><p></p><p>"Such a rare sight, since I am here, it would be a pity if I can't see it with my own eyes. I wonder if Fellow Daoist can fulfill my long-cherished wish?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing looked at Xu Bai's smiling face and her eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, she agreed, "It's a small matter. Since Fellow Daoist is interested, wait a moment, and I will have someone take you there. However, at the severed head, be careful of the sword qi and lingering residual thoughts."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's face showed surprise, then delight, "After such a long time, the sword qi still exists, enough to imagine the magnificence of that year. After what Fellow Daoist said, I am even more looking forward to it."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing smiled silently.</p><p></p><p>After she left, not long after, a young woman who appeared to be seventeen or eighteen, dressed in a veil, walked in.</p><p></p><p>"Please follow me, sir."</p><p></p><p>Speaking, the veiled woman summoned an inflated spherical exotic beast.</p><p></p><p>A gap opened in the sphere, and the woman walked in.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai, with some curiosity, followed suit and entered.</p><p></p><p>Inside the spherical beast, there were seats for people to sit, and as the two entered, it continued to inflate.</p><p></p><p>Slowly floating out of the pagoda, it swiftly headed towards the distant "Imperial Sacred Land." new 69 book 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>The body of the spherical beast gradually became transparent, allowing Xu Bai to see the surrounding scenes clearly.</p><p></p><p>"This is the 'Aero-Beast.' After inflation, it's able to soar high in the sky, travel through the wind, and its speed is extremely fast. When the people of the Empire go to visit the Sacred Land, they mostly use this method." The veiled woman explained softly to Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>"But if sir wants to visit, the Green Saint has already ordered to temporarily clear the visitors at the Sacred Land to avoid disturbing your peace."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the gentle introduction of the woman, they soon arrived at one of the broken heads of the Nine-Headed Crimson.</p><p></p><p>"This is one of the nine temples."</p><p></p><p>Following the woman, Xu Bai walked into the quiet building. Upon stepping in, he faintly perceived the howls of resentment and sorrow.</p><p></p><p>The ground and walls were covered with dark slate, creating a solemn and dark atmosphere in the temple.</p><p></p><p>Without the woman guiding him, Xu Bai followed the direction of the sound and walked towards the depths of the temple.</p><p></p><p>The further he went in, the louder the cries of the exotic beasts became.</p><p></p><p>Through the introduction from the veiled woman, he realized that these were not just the sounds from the Nine-Headed Crimson before its death.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was the collective screams of the countless exotic beasts that had been slaughtered as sacrifices over the years to suppress the ferocity of the divine bird.</p><p></p><p>Each temple had witnessed the tragic deaths of countless exotic beasts.</p><p></p><p>With numerous resentful souls lingering, the place had turned into a hellish underworld.</p><p></p><p>However, inside this temple, even though there was some solemnity, there were no signs of haunting by resentful spirits.</p><p></p><p>Because there was an unparalleled sharp sword qi that firmly suppressed them.</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh..."</p><p></p><p>A strand of hair suddenly fell, causing Xu Bai to halt his steps.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, the black fleshy mass, like entangled vines, coiled into a ball.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, it would wriggle, making it hard to believe that it was the corpse of a monster that had died thousands of years ago.</p><p></p><p>Above the black mass of flesh, there was a red sword qi.</p><p></p><p>In fact, ordinary cultivators couldn't see this red sword qi.</p><p></p><p>Let alone the ordinary people in the Empire.</p><p></p><p>They could only deduce the residual "immortal sword qi" from the continuously suppressed black fleshy mass and the sporadic outbursts of sword qi.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Bai could see everything clearly.</p><p></p><p>Even...</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai closed his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>A scene suddenly appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>It was a red light that illuminated the heaven and earth, seemingly faster than lightning.</p><p></p><p>Contained within was a sharp intent that could cleave the heavens and earth apart.</p><p></p><p>"Seems like a rope, in fact, it is..."</p><p></p><p>"A sword."</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the red line in front of him, Xu Bai, lost in thought, said, "The red rope sword given by Mr. Bai... Compared to the 'Wooden Sword' he wielded in the Meteorite Immortal Realm, this red rope sword carries a stronger killing intent. It's more like it carries a trace of punishment."</p><p></p><p>Numerous insights continuously emerged from Xu Bai's heart.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to see the figure of Mr. Bai gently flicking a strand of thread.</p><p></p><p>And the once unrivaled and arrogant Nine-Headed Crimson, died a miserable death on the spot.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In this way, Xu Bai immersed himself in contemplation, unaware of the passing time.</p><p></p><p>The veiled girl did not dare to disturb him and stood silently behind Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>And not far from Xu Bai, on the other side of the wall of the temple.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing and a graceful girl were staring intently at Xu Bai through the transparent wall.</p><p></p><p>"How is it, can you confirm?" Xiao Qing asked, with a rare hint of anxiety flickering in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>The girl kept her eyes closed the whole time.</p><p></p><p>Her eyelashes trembled, and sweat beads fell from her face.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, she suddenly opened her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"How could this be?"</p><p></p><p>The girl was filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>"When I saw him, it felt like I was looking at myself!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

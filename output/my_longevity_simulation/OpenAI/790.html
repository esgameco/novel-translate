        <h1>Chapter 790</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Just promoted to the realm of Yuanying, Xu Bai took action once again.</p><p></p><p>This time, Li Fan, who was still immersed in shock, instantly felt his heart rate accelerate and a sense of suffocation.</p><p></p><p>As it is well known,</p><p></p><p>In the Huangjia world, after the founding of the new law by the great law-transmitting Heavenly Venerable, in order to achieve the realm of Harmony, one must obtain the **Essence of Heaven and Earth**.</p><p></p><p>Before this, Li Fan had once imagined the path Saint Embryo Xu Bai would take to enter Harmony.</p><p></p><p>Red flames, green winds, black swamps...</p><p></p><p>Or the immensely powerful, world-destroying task of **Ink Kill**.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Li Fan truly perceived what was happening on Saint Embryo Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>His cognition was once again completely overturned!</p><p></p><p>Saint Embryo Xu Bai stood silently in the air like a stone statue, unmoving.</p><p></p><p>But it seemed like something was descending from the sky.</p><p></p><p>And it landed on Saint Embryo Xu Bai!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's mind, there were instant flashes of some scenes.</p><p></p><p>Fertile land, teeming with life. The figure of a lake-shaped Modu descended, then froze a thousand miles around. Wherever one looked, everything fell into complete silence.</p><p></p><p>Essence of Heaven and Earth: Haobing!</p><p></p><p>In Xu Bai's originally pitch-black hair, a strand of frost-white suddenly emerged.</p><p></p><p>Although it quickly returned to normal, this phenomenon brought immense shock to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Because according to the insight from Xu Bai's body, in that instant just now, he had already mastered the power of the Essence of Heaven and Earth, **Haobing**!</p><p></p><p>The Essence of Heaven and Earth is born with a divine duty and each one has its own power. </p><p></p><p>Once a cultivator kills it, refines it, and replaces it, he can instantly steal and control the power originally belonging to Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>This is also why the combat power of new law Harmony cultivators usually far surpasses that of old law Harmony cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But now, it seemed that something forbidden by the laws of the new law was happening on Saint Embryo Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Without killing the Essence of Heaven and Earth, the power of the Essence of Heaven and Earth transferred to him!</p><p></p><p>And this was just the first one!</p><p></p><p>Silently, a second wave of fluctuations crossed over millions of miles and landed on Saint Embryo Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan once again had visions in front of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>A desolate land of a thousand miles, with strange insects rampant and no blade of grass growing. Suddenly, there was a drizzle falling on the world.</p><p></p><p>The originally barren land was nourished and slowly became fertile. The strange insects seemed to encounter a terrifying natural enemy.</p><p></p><p>In the desperate squeals, their bodies slowly dissolved. Washed away by the rain, they turned into fertilizer for the earth.</p><p></p><p>Essence of Heaven and Earth: Daiyu!</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's hair seemed to have subtly lengthened.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart suddenly stopped beating.</p><p></p><p>Because in that moment, Xu Bai also gained the power of **Daiyu**.</p><p></p><p>Within moments, two Essence of Heaven and Earth powers had already joined his body.</p><p></p><p>Yet Xu Bai was not satisfied. He closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Stretching out his hands towards the sky, he opened his arms.</p><p></p><p>From east to west, from south to north.</p><p></p><p>Essences of Heaven and Earth came one after the other.</p><p></p><p>"Damn!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan cursed in his heart, instantly stopping his dazed observation and quickening his own actions.</p><p></p><p>"At this Harmony speed of his, it's afraid he won't have time to set up the chaotic puppet in every province."</p><p></p><p>"Only the provinces with more cultivators should be chosen."</p><p></p><p>"After completing that, return to Changsheng Valley as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>While flying towards the nearest Heavenly City, Li Fan thought back and observed everything happening on Saint Embryo Xu Bai, his thoughts racing.</p><p></p><p>"Obtaining the power of the Essence of Heaven and Earth without killing it."</p><p></p><p>"This is **Misdirection of Heaven's Principles**..."</p><p></p><p>"Even as the incarnation of the Heavenly Dao, this is a bit excessive!"</p><p></p><p>"And Saint Embryo Xu Bai's behavior..."</p><p></p><p>"It's not about sacrificing the Essence of Heaven and Earth, but embodying the Essence of Heaven and Earth within himself!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan understood Xu Bai's plan.</p><p></p><p>Even with the innate talent of the Heavenly Dao incarnate, wanting to **defy the laws of Heaven and Earth** was not something that could be accomplished overnight.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, from the conversation he overheard between Sun Liancheng and Sun Qi earlier, the deeper one delves into the heavenly scroll, the more difficult it becomes to reverse the laws of Heaven and Earth, with the backlash becoming stronger.</p><p></p><p>It was very likely that Xu Bai would not be able to reach the realm of Eternal Life at all.</p><p></p><p>But once he resurrects, he will definitely have to deal with those Eternal Lord Venerables.</p><p></p><p>The difference between Harmony and Eternal Life was like the difference between heaven and hell.</p><p></p><p>How could one resist against such power?</p><p></p><p>Only by unleashing the power of Harmony to the utmost.</p><p></p><p>One Essence of Heaven and Earth was equivalent to the power of a Harmony realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>If one Harmony cultivator was not enough to match the power of the Eternal Lord Venerables, then ten, a hundred would be needed!</p><p></p><p>The various powers of the different Essences of Heaven and Earth merged into Xu Bai's body.</p><p></p><p>With each fusion, his aura rose to another level.</p><p></p><p>And the scenes perceived by Li Fan slowly became vague.</p><p></p><p>From being immersed in the situation to watching through a thin veil, to seeing things unclearly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was losing absolute control over Saint Embryo Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>This also meant...</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai was awakening!</p><p></p><p>Seizing this final opportunity, Li Fan tried to gather as much information as possible from Saint Embryo Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is..."</p><p></p><p>"Obtaining the power of the Essence of Heaven and Earth does not mean that there are no such Essences left in the Huangjia world."</p><p></p><p>"Instead, through **Misdirection**, the power originally belonging to the Essence of Heaven and Earth is temporarily transferred to him."</p><p></p><p>"Countless different energies blending together, and there isn't a hint of rejection."</p><p></p><p>"No, this is not a matter of innate talent."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan keenly noticed something.</p><p></p><p>As the number of Essence of Heaven and Earth powers misdirected to Xu Bai increased, his body started to undergo slight changes.</p><p></p><p>His height, his features, began to resemble more and more the ethereal form of the Essence of Heaven and Earth!</p><p></p><p>The pressure was growing stronger, and Li Fan completely felt the pressure of life and death, the impending catastrophe.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, when Saint Embryo Xu Bai had misdirected all the loose Essences of Heaven and Earth power in the world through his body, his actions towards Harmony slowed down.</p><p></p><p>Because, next, it would be time for those Essences of Heaven and Earth, which did not exist in the world and only appeared at crucial moments, to appear on the scene.</p><p></p><p>The sky over Tianlingzhou suddenly darkened.</p><p></p><p>A barely noticeable shadow attached itself to Saint Embryo Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan felt the incoming information, sweat dripped down his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Not out of fear, but because sharing the same body with Saint Embryo Xu Bai had already exerted immense pressure on him.</p><p></p><p>In simpler terms, it was like asking, "What level are you at? Sharing the same body with me?"</p><p></p><p>The scenes appeared and disappeared intermittently, and Li Fan sensed that there seemed to be another extremely powerful Essence of Heaven and Earth descending upon Tianlingzhou.</p>

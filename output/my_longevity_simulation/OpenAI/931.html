        <h1>Chapter 931</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The body that should have healed quickly was continuously becoming fragmented during rebirth.</p><p></p><p>A pain as if bones were being plucked and soul being drawn.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the pain transmitted by the clone, Li Fan couldn't help but furrow his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like an extremely strange force resided around the wound, preventing it from healing.</p><p></p><p>This force wouldn't disappear with the destruction of the physical body but would seep into the clone's Dao Foundation like maggots on a bone.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a premonition that if left unchecked, even the clone's "Heaven's Miracle" Dao Realm might be eroded.</p><p></p><p>"The celestial arrows from before don't seem to be this powerful. It's like they are specifically targeting new law cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"Not only has their quantity increased manyfold, even their lethality has been enhanced..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the increasing number of celestial arrows in the sky of the Eternal Immortal Alliance, Li Fan felt unusually uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Because in his view, although these celestial arrows were individual entities, they might eventually form a huge array that enveloped the entire Eternal Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Covering the sky like a giant net.</p><p></p><p>Just like the mysterious web Li Fan had encountered before.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Fan activated the power of the Terminal Dissipation Disc and began deducing.</p><p></p><p>After a few breaths, the calculation results of the Terminal Dissipation Disc confirmed the feasibility of Li Fan's speculation.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then thought about the new defensive formation encountered by the clone when returning.</p><p></p><p>It was almost certain that the Eternal Immortal Alliance was preparing for a major event recently. It was just a matter of what sudden revelation would surprise the Council of Five Elders.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's related to the replacement of that person who took the transmission technique with Mo Rubin."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted his eyes, numerous thoughts flashing through his mind.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he decided to temporarily set it aside.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing at the moment was to heal the clone.</p><p></p><p>Achieving Dao Foundation as the Heaven's Miracle was not easy. If it was destroyed so easily, it would be a pity.</p><p></p><p>While the clone was at the Council of Five Elders, Li Fan had been diligently studying the "Heavenly Medical Canon" in the secluded chamber of the Spiritwood Realm. </p><p></p><p>Combining it with the "Heavenly Physician's Scripture" and various information gathered from multiple reincarnations.</p><p></p><p>Now, in terms of the way of medicine, Li Fan could be said to have touched the doorway.</p><p></p><p>And the level of this preliminary glimpse in the way of medicine was far superior to the common practitioners in the Profound Yellow Realm. Li Fan was almost completely dominant.</p><p></p><p>After all, based on the lifelong experience of the Heavenly Physician, it was difficult to become a quack doctor.</p><p></p><p>"The failure of a god requires weakening its soul first, followed by healing it with injuries..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled the contents of the Heavenly Medical Canon, his expression solemn.</p><p></p><p>Channels a strand of divine soul power, enveloped in pure spiritual power, forming several silver needles.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a gentle wave, these silver needles all pierced into the clone Li Qing's broken body and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Originally struggling with pain and continuous convulsions, the clone Li Qing fell into a deep slumber in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Unable to feel any more pain, as if already dead.</p><p></p><p>Awaiting silently for a moment, Li Fan's mind moved: "Swift!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, all these silver needles returned.</p><p></p><p>Lined up neatly in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The silver needle bodies that were originally silver had become dark in this short time.</p><p></p><p>It was as if there was some toxin that was being absorbed along the needle tips.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the power of their divine soul within these silver needles, Li Fan discovered that once contaminated with this darkness, the power of the divine soul seemed to be directly transformed and quickly dimmed.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad in terms of power."</p><p></p><p>"However, compared to the 'illness' I saw on Han Zhong before, it is still weaker by far."</p><p></p><p>"After all, this dark force only extinguishes the divine soul. With the Boundless Yin-Yang Law I have, even if the divine soul is consumed, it can quickly be replenished."</p><p></p><p>"While that extraplanar illness directly affects the limit of the divine soul."</p><p></p><p>Thinking like this, Li Fan's hands didn't stop.</p><p></p><p>One silver needle after another flew into Li Qing's body, extracting the continuously corroding dark force.</p><p></p><p>As the chief culprit disappeared, Li Qing's complexion gradually improved.</p><p></p><p>As for these extracted dark forces, Li Fan used the Seven-Colored Divine Light to temporarily seal and preserve all of them.</p><p></p><p>Maybe there would be surprises in researching them later.</p><p></p><p>After making sure that the last strand of dark force had been removed, Li Fan finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Medical Canon is indeed outstanding. With a little testing, I've solved the Eternal Immortal Alliance's experimental killing weapon."</p><p></p><p>The principle of this treatment was simple.</p><p></p><p>It suppressed Li Qing's soul activity, then the silver needles injected their own divine soul power into it as bait.</p><p></p><p>Drawing out the poison.</p><p></p><p>Of course, to complete the treatment without causing damage to the patient's divine soul, the healer needed a high level of proficiency in the divine soul.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that the patient was his own clone, Li Fan was extremely familiar with him, and he had the Boundless Yin-Yang Law for a steady supply of divine soul, the treatment wouldn't have been so easy.</p><p></p><p>Some time later, Li Qing slowly woke up.</p><p></p><p>The first thing he said was, "The celestial arrows weren't just bad luck in targeting me. It should be because when I broke through the defensive formation, something was left on me."</p><p></p><p>"So that's why I was attacked by the celestial arrows."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly, "I also thought of this."</p><p></p><p>"That new formation indeed has its tricks. Although it doesn't seem too difficult to crack initially, in hindsight, it intentionally exposed its flaws."</p><p></p><p>"It's like a lure, when a formation master follows the exposed flaw and seemingly breaks the formation on the surface, secretly activating a mark."</p><p></p><p>"By using this mark, in conjunction with the ubiquitous celestial arrows in the Eternal Immortal Alliance, it is enough to make the kill after the fact."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Lui Xichan's return still has some usefulness. A formation that appears to be protective but is actually a trap, without some proficiency, it's hard to figure out." Li Fan said slowly.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing also sighed, "Fortunately, I have the Heaven's Miracle as the Dao Foundation, with my blood, flesh, and sword techniques merged into one. So even if I left bloodstains, I'm not afraid of being traced. If it were an ordinary cultivator, even if they survived under the celestial arrows, the Alliance could track them down based on the blood left on the arrows."</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, let's stay low for a while. The Eternal Immortal Alliance has prepared so many cards; it seems like they are planning a major move. Let's just wait and watch." Li Fan advised.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a touch at his brow, silver light containing the Xuantian Teaching techniques flew out of his mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was cautious and did not directly observe it himself but let the clone read it, synchronizing the knowledge into the master's mind step by step.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 864</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>However, at this sensitive moment when the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders Association were on the verge of a confrontation, Li Fan did not act overly arrogant. </p><p></p><p>The colorful divine light was too conspicuous, so Li Fan deliberately consumed more spiritual power and, like he did before when destroying the yellow one-eyed paper man, condensed the colorful light into a faint white light.</p><p></p><p>Flying at a low altitude, he also used secret techniques to conceal his aura.</p><p></p><p>His speed was astonishingly fast, and in a moment, he had already crossed the Tianling Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Facing the barrier of white mist in front of him, he did not evade or dodge but charged straight through!</p><p></p><p>The colorful jade light was extremely overbearing and unruly, not allowing any external interference.</p><p></p><p>Even the white mist, which could devour lifespan and had a mysterious origin, could not find a loophole to intrude and could only wander outside without making progress.</p><p></p><p>With the inexhaustible pure spiritual energy from the Five Elements Grand Cave as the driving force, Li Fan was able to unleash the speed of the colorful divine light to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Before setting off, he informed Lin Ling.</p><p></p><p>Both of them arrived almost simultaneously at the Shilin Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"The Escape Technique of the Colorful Divine Light, compared to swiftly shuttling through the earth's veins, may not slow down much!" Li Fan nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>This way, his weakness in running away was also made up for. In the face of any life-threatening crisis in the future, he wouldn't immediately have to consider fighting back but could first try to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Master," Lin Ling sensed the earth-shattering changes happening on Li Fan and couldn't help feeling surprised as she assessed him from top to bottom.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go," Li Fan said while looking into the distance at the border between Shilin and Jiushan Prefecture, where a group of cultivators had gathered, giving instructions.</p><p></p><p>During his seclusion and advancement, due to the false information he provided, there had been some minor frictions between the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders Association as they were bordering regions, resulting in disturbances in both territories.</p><p></p><p>The defensive formations of both parties had been continuously activated.</p><p></p><p>And because the insider from the Array Hall had not been discovered previously, the defensive grand formation this time was unprecedented and had been newly created by the headquarters of the immortal alliance - the "God-slaying Formation."</p><p></p><p>The name was quite domineering, and the actual effect was indeed outstanding.</p><p></p><p>The previously infallible End Disarrangement Disc, for some reason, hadn't been able to break this formation in a short period.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted his eyes, "It seems that it's not just a simple formation. There are also some formidable cultivators who act as the formation eyes in the God-slaying Formation, mitigating any possible shortcomings of the formation."</p><p></p><p>According to the results derived from the Disarrangement Disc, even if a cultivator suppressing the formation at a specific point was defeated, as long as the structural integrity of the formation remained intact, it could quickly draw power from elsewhere to regenerate a new formation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this newly generated formation had some changes compared to before.</p><p></p><p>"The power of the God-slaying Formation will continuously strengthen as the leading cultivator overseeing the formation improves. If there were four Unity Realm experts..."</p><p></p><p>"Then not even the Longevity Heaven Venerable would be able to break it."</p><p></p><p>This was the conclusion presented by the Operation Disc.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the formation only covered the territory and the sky, as well as the shallow layers of the earth, leaving the deep veins of the earth unscathed.</p><p></p><p>Led by Lin Ling, Li Fan crossed the defense line of the Wanxian Alliance and arrived at Jiushan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiushan was also tense.</p><p></p><p>It could be seen that the Five Elders Association had built many fortresses on the nine mountain peaks.</p><p></p><p>They looked like black spheres buried in the ground, with only the top portion exposed in an arched shape.</p><p></p><p>The black sphere fortress faintly displayed a red dot.</p><p></p><p>Moving constantly.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan cast his gaze, the red dot immediately reacted and stared back.</p><p></p><p>A faint sense of danger surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, it quickly disappeared as soon as the red dot was disengaged.</p><p></p><p>Presumably, it was because Lin Ling had already sent out a signal for contact.</p><p></p><p>While waiting for the other party to arrive, Li Fan observed Jiushan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>It had nothing to do with the Five Elders Association's defensive layout, but Li Fan was trying to see if he could find any traces of the yellow paper men of the Crossing Calamity Sect here again.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the brief effect brought by destroying the paper men had disappeared. Li Fan observed for a long time but did not find where those hidden talismans were located.</p><p></p><p>"Although out of sight, there is always some discomfort in the heart," Li Fan frowned to himself.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was contemplating, a figure suddenly appeared from the sky.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the figure appeared in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the previous contact person, this time, the one who came for negotiations was a young cultivator dressed as a scholar, exuding a righteous aura.</p><p></p><p>What was quite strange was that this scholar carried a stone tablet on his back.</p><p></p><p>The inscriptions on it seemed to be hidden by some kind of power, making the content unreadable.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually impossible to see his cultivation level," Li Fan's heart skipped a beat, not daring to be careless.</p><p></p><p>"The friend looks a bit unfamiliar. What about the previous person?"</p><p></p><p>"The Wanxian Alliance launched a sudden attack sometime ago. Unfortunately, he has fallen." The scholar's tone was calm, but there was no hint of sorrow on his face.</p><p></p><p>Not knowing whether it was true or false, Li Fan also didn't care about this matter.</p><p></p><p>His expression turned serious as he went straight to the point, "This time, it is our Universal Realms Union seeking help."</p><p></p><p>The scholar's face showed a hint of surprise at this point.</p><p></p><p>But he quickly responded, "Although it was a trade before, we did benefit a lot. If there are any difficulties, please speak up."</p><p></p><p>After glancing around, Li Fan then set up a formation, isolating the Universal Realms.</p><p></p><p>Lowering his voice, he whispered, "Recently, one of our elders in the Union, after going into seclusion, suddenly discovered something that shocked him."</p><p></p><p>"In this Xuanhuang Realm, it is filled with a kind of yellow paper-made one-eyed figure."</p><p></p><p>"It's not only in the Xuanhuang main realm but also in the surrounding small worlds. The feeling of being constantly watched is terrible. However, we have tried many methods, all of which cannot eliminate these talismans..."</p><p></p><p>"I dare to ask if the friend has any good ideas?"</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan spoke slowly, he observed the other party's reaction.</p><p></p><p>When he saw that the scholar did not have any special reaction to the talk of the talisman figures, Li Fan knew.</p><p></p><p>This person's identity was definitely not simple; he must have known about the existence of the Crossing Calamity Sect's talismans for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The scholar with the stone tablet behind him solemnly said, "Indeed, there are many ways to clean up these talismans, but the cost is a bit high. I do not recommend you to do so."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover..."</p><p></p><p>A faint invisible blue light emanated from the stone tablet behind the scholar, and he paused before adding, "This Known World Divine Eye has almost merged into the basic laws of the Xuanhuang Realm. If all of them were cleaned up, it would inevitably cause immeasurable harm to the Xuanhuang Realm." By saying this, the scholarâ€™s intentions were already quite clear.</p>

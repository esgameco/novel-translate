        <h1>Chapter 726</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>When Li Fansan and the others explored the entire maze but still couldn't find the exit, they had no choice but to return to the black sphere.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that if we want to get out, we still have to figure it out from this thing." Huang Fu Song's expression was grim.</p><p></p><p>"Could the exit be within this thing?" Dongfang Yao shivered.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is this black sphere? You two have broad knowledge, any clues?" Li Fan stared ahead for a long time before asking.</p><p></p><p>"I do know some things that cannot be sensed by divine sense, but it clearly doesn't match with this thing!" Dongfang and Huang Fu were at a loss.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, the black symbol above Li Fan's head gradually weakened, indicating the depletion of energy.</p><p></p><p>"Staying here is not a solution, we should try to figure out its reality." Taking out a new symbol, Li Fan first flew to the tentacles protruding from the black sphere and lightly touched them.</p><p></p><p>Like an illusion, Li Fan's hand ended up in emptiness.</p><p></p><p>"It's as if it doesn't exist. But why can it stick to Puxian Zhenzhou?" The three looked at each other, unable to figure it out.</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Li Fan shielded himself, then flew directly towards the huge black sphere.</p><p></p><p>Huang Fu and Dongfang hesitated for a moment but followed immediately.</p><p></p><p>The constantly wriggling black sticky substance gathered together, filling the whole field of vision and creating a tremendous pressure.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the uneasiness in their hearts, the three resisted the discomfort and "drilled" into the interior of the black orb.</p><p></p><p>Although they couldn't touch the black substances with their divine sense and physical bodies, once their bodies were completely enveloped by them, they felt a strange sensation.</p><p></p><p>It was like being covered all over with cold reptiles, feeling damp and nauseous.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, apart from the "feeling" in their hearts, these viscous black substances did not seem to pose any other harm.</p><p></p><p>The three moved cautiously, like walking in a muddy swamp, slowly advancing towards the central area.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, surrounded by a black ocean, some changes finally appeared.</p><p></p><p>Ahead, something seemed to be emitting a faint light.</p><p></p><p>"Quick! The exit should be ahead!" Huang Fu Song's divine sense transmitted excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Dongfang Yao were just about to respond when the previously calm black sea outside the ball suddenly boiled.</p><p></p><p>The black sticky substances, which were supposed to be intangible and impossible to touch, began rushing madly towards Huang Fu Song.</p><p></p><p>And now, inexplicably, these substances found a way to penetrate into him through his orifices.</p><p></p><p>"Wu wu..." His face showed an expression of extreme horror, and his body gradually began to swell like a balloon.</p><p></p><p>"Help me!" He couldn't make a sound, but Huang Fu Song transmitted his message through divine sense to his two companions for help.</p><p></p><p>However, this had the opposite effect, as the infusion of black substances into him became faster.</p><p></p><p>Huang Fu Song's face showed a ferocious and painful expression.</p><p></p><p>One artifact after another emerged from him, and he even took out a disintegration disk to set up a formation around them in an instant.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>All in vain!</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, his body had swollen more than ten times.</p><p></p><p>With a bang!</p><p></p><p>In the end, to the horror of Li Fan and Dongfang Yao, he burst open with a bang!</p><p></p><p>There was no splattering of blood and flesh, only a large amount of black sticky substances dispersed around.</p><p></p><p>According to common sense, cultivators above the Nascent Soul stage, even if their physical bodies are destroyed, as long as their spiritual realm remains intact, they can instantly resurrect.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, something terrifying happened that left the two shocked.</p><p></p><p>After a while, there was still no sign of Huang Fu Song's physical reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they seemed to sense a faint ray of light breaking through the air and flying away, its destination unknown.</p><p></p><p>"Is he... dead?" Li Fan suddenly froze in shock.</p><p></p><p>"Huang Fu!" Dongfang Yao's eyes widened with rage, rushing forward frantically to try to find traces of Huang Fu Song.</p><p></p><p>But all they found in the original spot were Huang Fu Song's personal belongings like the Quantity Heaven Mirror and disintegration disk. Nothing remained, not even a hair.</p><p></p><p>As they replayed the sudden events in their minds, a guess suddenly struck Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps these black sticky substances are...</p><p></p><p>Shocked, Li Fan shouted, "Brother Dongfang, remember, don't let your divine sense leave your body! Communication through words is enough!"</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao instantly understood, his face turning pale.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan flew to Dongfang Yao's side and collected Huang Fu Song's belongings.</p><p></p><p>Then he said in a low voice, "We shouldn't stay here for long, let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Grabbing Dongfang Yao, they flew towards the center of the divine sense black sphere.</p><p></p><p>Outside the black sphere, the aggregation of divine sense was relatively dispersed. So even when they used their own divine sense to probe, it didn't trigger any special reaction.</p><p></p><p>But inside this black sphere, the divine sense had condensed to a startling degree.</p><p></p><p>The impulsive transmission of divine sense by Huang Fu Song had immediately stirred these concentrated divine senses, providing them with an outlet.</p><p></p><p>Before Huang Fu Song could resist, they poured into his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Even with the resilience of a Nascent Soul cultivator's soul, it couldn't withstand such a massive influx of divine sense.</p><p></p><p>He burst on the spot, soul scattered!</p><p></p><p>As Eastfang Yao felt sorrowful and frightened, he also broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>If he had transmitted his divine sense first just now...</p><p></p><p>Taking Eastfang Yao with him, Li Fan passed through the most central glowing layer of space and entered a relatively empty inner space.</p><p></p><p>Although there were no tangible black divine senses here, there were floating transparent faces.</p><p></p><p>Expressions of joy, anger, sorrow, and fear.</p><p></p><p>Countless faces had different expressions, but they all lacked eyes.</p><p></p><p>Like a shoal of fish, they wandered around here constantly.</p><p></p><p>Dongfang Yao was shocked and tried to avoid these transparent faces floating past.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan casually took one of the faces and absorbed it.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a blurry image appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Sounds of wailing and crying came from all directions.</p><p></p><p>Under the crimson sky, the shadow of death rapidly engulfed all living creatures.</p><p></p><p>But like being blindfolded, these scenes could only provide a rough overview.</p><p></p><p>When the shadows reached before their eyes, everything went dark, and the images in their minds shattered suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully pondered for a while, uncertain if his spiritual strength had increased.</p><p></p><p>But the sudden disappearance of the transparent faces caught the attention of the other existences in the area.</p><p></p><p>They seemed to become somewhat restless, and their wandering speed increased.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Li Fan decided not to act rashly.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Taking Dongfang Yao, Li Fan flew towards the top of the space, where the light was most dazzling.</p><p></p><p>They found the exit of the maze.</p><p></p><p>A moment of haze, and they returned outside the maze.</p><p></p><p>"Huang Fu Brother!"</p>

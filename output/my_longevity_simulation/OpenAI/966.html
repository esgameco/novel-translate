        <h1>Chapter 966</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan just coldly snorted, "If you want to get close, at least recognize the right people!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he once again launched an attack towards the ink scholar Bin that had just formed in his own spiritual sea.</p><p></p><p>Although he couldn't tap into the spiritual power of other cultivators, relying solely on the countless thoughts of demons and gods, this attack was still formidable.</p><p></p><p>However, there was a big gap compared to the previous attack that had shattered Ink Scholar Bin. In order to cover it up, Li Fan deliberately pretended to be hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"Xing Wang, hold on a moment!" Ink Scholar Bin easily broke the offensive.</p><p></p><p>Sensing Li Fan's hesitation, he continued, "I know your memory may be somewhat lacking, but the Xuantian Sect back then, you should still have some impressions, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Xuantian Sect…" Li Fan's attack seemed to gradually slow down as he pondered.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Ink Scholar Bin's face lit up.</p><p></p><p>"No! There is no Xuantian Sect at all! Only the Supreme Red Dust Compassionate True Immortal!" Suddenly, Li Fan's expression changed, coldly staring at Ink Scholar Bin.</p><p></p><p>Above this sinister and eerie setting, the image of the faceless True Immortal stone statue slowly emerged.</p><p></p><p>Like a great sun, dispersing darkness and illuminating the world.</p><p></p><p>"Xuantian Statue?!" Seeing this statue that had long disappeared from the world, Ink Scholar Bin became more certain of his judgment.</p><p></p><p>"Bold heretic! How dare you distort the Supreme Red Dust Compassionate True Immortal!" Li Fan's eyes showed a hint of madness, and his entire spiritual sea seemed to be stirred up by something, shaking violently.</p><p></p><p>The countless demons and gods also glared angrily at Ink Scholar Bin, showing a fierce expression.</p><p></p><p>"Xing Wang, don't harm your own people! This…" </p><p></p><p>"Not the Supreme Red Dust Compassionate True Immortal Statue, it is actually the Xuantian Statue!"</p><p></p><p>"We are one family!" Ink Scholar Bin tried to pacify Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"One family?" Li Fan's manic state seemed to ease a bit at his words.</p><p></p><p>"So, are you also a follower of the Supreme Red Dust Compassionate True Immortal?" he observed Ink Scholar Bin with a hint of doubt.</p><p></p><p>Ink Scholar Bin hesitated for a moment, but seeing Li Fan showing signs of madness again, he reluctantly nodded, "Well, sort of."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, why didn't you say so earlier!" Li Fan then completely let go of his guard.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the myriad demons and the blood moon in the sky all disappeared.</p><p></p><p>On the vast white land, only Ink Scholar Bin and Li Fan faced each other.</p><p></p><p>"Why have I never seen you before? Could it be that the True Immortal left a different lineage elsewhere?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? No, I seem to have recently visited you? Who am I? Wait, who am I?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who was somewhat composed earlier, suddenly showed signs of madness again in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Ink Scholar Bin frowned inwardly, "This symptom seems to be much more severe than before. But the aura of this technique is exactly the same. There's no doubt..."</p><p></p><p>"Xing Wang, no matter what happened in the past, as long as our goals are aligned, that's what matters." Ink Scholar Bin tried to awaken Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was briefly surprised, "Goals?"</p><p></p><p>Then he realized, "Right! The Heavenly Dao is obscure, the True Immortal lineage is absent from the world. I must set things right and let the name of the Compassionate True Immortal shine once more in the world!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, as if in response to Li Fan's words, a faint golden light appeared on the faceless stone statue in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Ink Scholar Bin's expression drastically changed upon seeing this golden light.</p><p></p><p>Subconsciously, he distanced himself slightly.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the somewhat bewildered Li Fan, after hesitating for a moment, he still spoke up to redirect the other's attention.</p><p></p><p>"The grand cause not yet achieved, how could we face the True Immortal? Xing Wang, wait until the day when the True Immortal lineage truly recovers before seeking her favor." Ink Scholar Bin hinted with a deep meaning.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan immediately showed respect, "Your insight is higher than mine?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the other calling him younger brother, Ink Scholar Bin did not refute.</p><p></p><p>In the sect back then, Sun Xing Wang did indeed call him this way.</p><p></p><p>"It seems he hasn't completely lost his mind," Ink Scholar Bin thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at Ink Scholar Bin solemnly, "But what you said makes sense. Without accomplishing something, it's indeed shameful to frequently seek the True Immortal."</p><p></p><p>Muttering to himself, the impact of the faceless stone statue in the sky also disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In relief, Ink Scholar Bin let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Xing Wang, do you remember the other brothers and sisters in the sect?" Seeing Li Fan's emotions stabilize, Ink Scholar Bin asked.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Li Fan's brow furrowed immediately.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly lost in deep reminiscence.</p><p></p><p>"The others..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's facial expressions kept changing, muttering a few names repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Yu Zheng, Cui Lao, Xuan Yuan big brother..."</p><p></p><p>Then he just kept repeating the name Xuan Yuan, causing a storm in his previously calm spiritual sea.</p><p></p><p>Ink Scholar Bin, realizing he couldn't inquire further, reluctantly gave up.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, Xing Wang. Let's talk about the past later. Let me ask you, are you behind the 'God’s Descendant' incidents in various states?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan proudly replied, "Yes! Currently, there are already three thousand six hundred and fifty-one cultivators under my control. Under my guidance day and night, they will soon become loyal followers of the Supreme Red Dust Compassionate True Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>"In just a short time, with three thousand followers! Unifying the world is just around the corner!"</p><p></p><p>Ink Scholar Bin shook his head slightly, "The Immortal Alliance has already attached great importance to this matter. I know it's probably your doing, which is why I took it upon myself to discuss this with you."</p><p></p><p>"Stop it, Xing Wang. Three thousand cultivators are quite enough now. If the situation worsens, it will certainly attract the intervention of other lineage carriers. By then, you may be at risk of exposure." Ink Scholar Bin advised.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan outright refused, "Stop? Based on what? I lurk in the shadows, undetected by anyone. The God’s Descendant is like wild grass, burning it doesn't kill it, it grows when the spring breeze blows. Under the heavens, who can stop me?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's tone was extremely arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Ink Scholar Bin sighed, "It's not that the Immortal Alliance is powerless in this matter. The situation just hasn't reached a certain level yet."</p><p></p><p>"If you continue like this..."</p><p></p><p>"Think about it, if I could find your spiritual sea through those cultivators' bodies, other lineage carriers can naturally do the same."</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan played a role as a mad cultivator, he was not stupid.</p><p></p><p>He didn't refute immediately and fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at Ink Scholar Bin, as if recalling something, and suddenly said, "You really have taken over that lineage carrier."</p><p></p><p>Ink Scholar Bin was slightly startled, "Xing Wang, have you regained your memory?"</p>

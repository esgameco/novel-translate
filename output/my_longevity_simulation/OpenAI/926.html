        <h1>Chapter 926</h1>

            <p>Subconsciously reaching out to grasp, wanting to seize and retain it.</p><p></p><p>During these ten years, he utilized the terrifying ability of the "Inverse Ethics Scripture," continuously corroding the cultivation of the female disciples of the Daodao Sect for his own use.</p><p></p><p>He also selected female disciples with exceptional aptitude and secretly nurtured them.</p><p></p><p>In the end, among the senior positions in the Daodao Sect, female cultivators occupied eighty percent.</p><p></p><p>The disciples in the sect were also dominated by yin, with male disciples being outnumbered and overpowered in both quantity and quality by female disciples.</p><p></p><p>Although the sect’s seniors eventually noticed something amiss.</p><p></p><p>But the situation had already been established. If they were to completely eradicate the Li Qing lineage, it would not be as simple as breaking a bone or two for the Daodao Sect.</p><p></p><p>It was highly likely that the sect would perish due to internal strife.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the bigger picture, after several discussions between both sides, a compromise was finally reached.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing’s past wrongdoings could be overlooked, and there would be no excessive interference in the future. However, it was necessary to ensure that the overall proportion of male cultivators in the Daodao Sect was maintained at a certain level, as well as the purity of the newly entered female disciples.</p><p></p><p>As a condition, a portion of the immortal longevity fruit would be allocated to the Li Qing lineage.</p><p></p><p>The longevity fruit grew on the tree of life.</p><p></p><p>Administered by ten sects, one fruit could validate one longevity.</p><p></p><p>Today was the final moment when Li Qing would finally reap and receive a portion of the longevity fruit.</p><p></p><p>However, at this critical moment, it just happened to disappear in front of Li Qing!</p><p></p><p>How could Li Qing, who had exhausted all his efforts and plans for a whole decade, accept this!</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing could no longer stay composed and let out a furious roar.</p><p></p><p>"No one is coming to help me!"</p><p></p><p>Despite his futile anger, he could not stop the dissipation of the longevity fruit.</p><p></p><p>Subconsciously turning around, Li Qing said to his partner in the hall.</p><p></p><p>And with just a glance, Li Qing suddenly felt a chill running down his spine.</p><p></p><p>Because in the hall, including the master teacher Huo Jingtong, more than ten female Daoist practitioners were all looking at him at the same time.</p><p></p><p>And...</p><p></p><p>Unlike the affectionate looks from the past, they were now completely different. So unfamiliar and eerie.</p><p></p><p>As if, in an instant, they had all exchanged souls.</p><p></p><p>As the Daodao Sect tremors intensified, Li Qing felt that everyone in the sect, all the cultivators, had their eyes fixed on him at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Even with Li Qing's enormous courage, he couldn't help but swallow his saliva and take a step back.</p><p></p><p>The hall was dead silent.</p><p></p><p>In the quietness, a figure suddenly appeared in front of Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>It was Zhao Ruoxi, who had been in seclusion for ten years and not seen for a long time!</p><p></p><p>Looking at this familiar yet unfamiliar beauty in front of him, Li Qing was filled with uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he had already reached the peak of cultivation and was just a step away from the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>But facing this former senior sister Zhao, his spiritual sense was fiercely warning him in his mind. </p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Feeling dizzy, Li Qing suddenly felt like he had forgotten something very important.</p><p></p><p>The experiences of the past ten years flashed through his mind in an instant.</p><p></p><p>But just as quickly as they appeared, they became somewhat blurry and unclear.</p><p></p><p>Like a dream.</p><p></p><p>"Very well."</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Zhao gazed at Li Qing and began with words of praise.</p><p></p><p>"I originally thought of just giving you a small punishment as the cost of your previous arrogance."</p><p></p><p>"But I didn't expect that in this situation, within just ten years, you could achieve such a level."</p><p></p><p>"Among all who have entered us over the years, you are the first."</p><p></p><p>"It's a very interesting experience."</p><p></p><p>There was no joy or anger on Senior Sister Zhao's face as she spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Qing realized that the expressions on the faces of the other female practitioners in the hall were exactly the same as Senior Sister Zhao's!</p><p></p><p>"Well…"</p><p></p><p>The scene in the Daodao Sect began to shake more violently.</p><p></p><p>And finally, it couldn't be sustained any longer and began to crumble inch by inch.</p><p></p><p>In the shattered light, Li Qing realized that everyone's faces had all turned into Senior Sister Zhao's face!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The screen suddenly went dark.</p><p></p><p>When Li Qing regained consciousness once again, memories long suppressed finally surged to his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Zhao's illusion technique is indeed powerful..."</p><p></p><p>"Even with prior defenses, I still sank into it and couldn't extricate myself."</p><p></p><p>Frowning slightly, Li Qing scanned his lower body with his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>"Thankfully, it was just a dream."</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to the captivating scenes in the illusion over the past ten years and recalling that these female protagonists were actually incarnations of the One-Mind Celestial Venerable, Li Qing was momentarily lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>But he was extraordinary in willpower, and quickly regained his senses.</p><p></p><p>He focused his attention on the extraordinary "Inverse Ethics Scripture."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately...</p><p></p><p>No matter how hard he tried to recall, the memories of the technique remained elusive, like flowers in a mirror and water shadows, unreachable.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing felt a sense of regret.</p><p></p><p>"Such a divine technique and yet I cannot bring it out. I wonder if this technique truly exists in reality or is it simply fabricated by the One-Mind Celestial Venerable in the illusion?"</p><p></p><p>With myriad thoughts swirling in his mind, he finally regained composure after a while.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, the scenery was very familiar.</p><p></p><p>It was completely consistent with the images of the Daodao Sect in the illusion.</p><p></p><p>And he was standing at the entrance of the sect.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the familiar rocky path ahead, Li Qing hesitated and was reluctant to step forward.</p><p></p><p>"Weren't you capable just now? Why are you so timid now?"</p><p></p><p>Just then, a mocking voice came from above the mountain path.</p><p></p><p>Holding a broom, the young outer disciple looked down at Li Qing from a high vantage point.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing knew that this person in front of him was also one of the many bodies of the One-Mind Celestial Venerable and did not show any disrespect.</p><p></p><p>He cupped his hands respectfully and bowed.</p><p></p><p>Then he walked slowly up the stone steps.</p><p></p><p>"You know the way, just go up on your own. I have to clean up too, so I won't accompany you," said the young outer disciple as he walked down the stone steps, passing by Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>Without raising his head, he gave this instruction casually.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he earnestly started to clean the stone steps that Li Qing had just walked on.</p><p></p><p>"Although they are all the same person, it seems that each body still maintains its original or specific identity..."</p><p></p><p>"What is this, role-playing?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing squinted his eyes and continued walking towards the depths of the Daodao Sect.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the eerie and silent scene at the final moments of the illusion when he saw everyone with Senior Sister Zhao's face, the Daodao Sect he was in now was full of vitality.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Li Qing encountered many cultivators.</p><p></p><p>They just glanced at Li Qing and continued with what they were doing before.</p><p></p><p>They conversed, argued, competed.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing even saw several pairs of Dao companions affectionately entwined.</p><p></p><p>It was bustling with activity, as if the Daodao Sect of the past had never gone extinct.</p><p></p><p>But the more so, the higher Li Qing's vigilance towards this "One-Mind Celestial Venerable" became.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 829</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>However, after leaving the Jiushan Prefecture, he did not directly return to the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he quietly returned to the Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the real lure fruits and other treasures containing the power of Tianzun, all other regular goods were handed over to the avatar Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>He planned to use the Tianxuan Mirror to "whiten" these items: sell them and then buy them back.</p><p></p><p>To eliminate any possible traces.</p><p></p><p>Even the valuable Kongming Stone Mother, which could be used to refine spatial magical treasures, was not left behind.</p><p></p><p>Although doing so would incur some loss in contribution points, it was still worth it to reduce the risk of being targeted by the immortal Tianzun.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was currently during the period of the Great War between the Wan Xian Alliance and the Five Elders' Meeting.</p><p></p><p>To avoid suspicion, Ji Shaoli needed time to white out these goods.</p><p></p><p>However, with the help of several other members of the Congyun Sea Mutual Aid Association, this process would not be too slow.</p><p></p><p>"As for those treasures containing the power of Tianzun, involving powers from other Tianzuns, it won't be so easy for Senior Sister Zhao to meddle with them."</p><p></p><p>These were all pure creations of laws, which Li Fan had encountered in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>After careful consideration and confirming that there should be no problem, he finally relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Despite Li Fan appearing calm during the recent trade, when Senior Sister Zhao's voice rang out and echoed in his mind, scenes of their interactions in the illusion involuntarily emerged.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with Li Fan's strong will and knowledge of refining the mind, he managed to suppress these thoughts in time and avoid any slip-ups.</p><p></p><p>He even took advantage of the situation and unintentionally revealed that he was very knowledgeable about the Wan Zhong Yixin Grand Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>Setting up a suspicious situation.</p><p></p><p>This made Senior Sister Zhao start to become suspicious, weakening the inadvertent charm she emitted.</p><p></p><p>This allowed Li Fan to gain the upper hand eventually.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of an immortal Tianzun, even with just one of his bodies, I need to go all out." Li Fan couldn't help but sigh slightly.</p><p></p><p>Leaving some of the Anxi Crystal Grid and the Humanitarian Stardust on Haixuan Island.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until a month later that the members of the Mutual Aid Association had completed the "cleaning" of most of the supplies.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan return to the Spirit Wood Realm with Lin Ling and Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>During this month on the island, Peituo, Xiangxin, and others were fortunate enough to see Lin Ling and Tianyang, even though they did not deliberately reveal their true strength. The faint pressure they exuded still amazed the members of the Mutual Aid Association.</p><p></p><p>They became more convinced that the Mutual Aid Association was undoubtedly a huge and powerful organization.</p><p></p><p>The Congyun Sea branch was just established recently.</p><p></p><p>Feeling fortunate to be among the first to join the Congyun Sea Mutual Aid Association, they became even more loyal to it.</p><p></p><p>Within this month, it seemed that the Five Elders' Meeting had taken Li Fan's advice before parting and significantly eased their offensives.</p><p></p><p>The fires of the border conflicts gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>However, the Five Elders' Meeting did not remain idle.</p><p></p><p>Rumors began to surface suddenly in various states of the Wan Xian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Although they were all related to past events, these rumors stirred up thoughts among the members of the alliance.</p><p></p><p>For example, a certain leader of the martial hall in Tianquan Prefecture killed an ordinary cultivator out of personal grudge. According to the alliance's regulations, he should have been dismissed and investigated. However, this matter seemed to have been forgotten over time. It was only when someone reminded others that they realized this leader had been living well for years! He was punished mildly and let off with just a salary cut!</p><p></p><p>Similarly, a consul in Youtai Prefecture neglected his duties during his term, leading to a natural disaster that could have been avoided. Hundreds of cultivators died as a result. The consul was removed from his position at the time. However, to everyone's surprise, after years had passed, he resurfaced in Tianyu Prefecture and was promoted to a higher position!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Such incidents, long buried in the past, suddenly erupted!</p><p></p><p>Most of them were unheard of by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>These were the forgotten scandals in history.</p><p></p><p>Driven by some force, they revived unexpectedly!</p><p></p><p>The alliance cultivators were naturally filled with indignation.</p><p></p><p>Although no disharmony had occurred yet, whispers of "the alliance is corrupt and not worth sacrificing for" and "I'll go towards death, will you come to enjoy? Why not destroy them together!" were secretly spreading.</p><p></p><p>Although the alliance took this situation very seriously and tightened surveillance in various states, how could the murmurs of the masses be easily stopped?</p><p></p><p>However, the delay tactic, which had always been effective, seemed to have lost its effectiveness all of a sudden.</p><p></p><p>Seven days, fifteen days, a month passed...</p><p></p><p>As time went on, the impact of the previously negative news had not yet been eliminated. New dark events from the past were being exposed in various places.</p><p></p><p>This left the Wan Xian Alliance in a bit of a mess.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli, the avatar, gathered and arranged these "dirty secrets" as if he had discovered a treasure, holding them firmly in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected the Five Elders' Meeting to have this move."</p><p></p><p>"But all these are invaluable treasures!"</p><p></p><p>"The frequent forgetting can indeed suppress negative emotions. However, if these forgotten memories suddenly resurface and erupt in a short period of time..."</p><p></p><p>"The destruction they bring will be quite terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"No less than a million-strong army!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, perhaps this also has to do with the fact that the power of forgetting that shrouded the alliance territories under the Unworried Tianzun has temporarily weakened."</p><p></p><p>"These are the means I will use in the future to reappear and attack the Wan Xian Alliance. I need to learn well."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli sighed in admiration of the surprises brought by the Five Elders' Meeting.</p><p></p><p>And a month and a half after the events, the Wan Xian Alliance finally responded.</p><p></p><p>The manner in which they responded also surprised Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>But after some contemplation, he couldn't help but exclaim in amazement.</p><p></p><p>"This move is brilliant!"</p><p></p><p>"There are talents within the Wan Xian Alliance!"</p><p></p><p>The response of the Wan Xian Alliance was simple.</p><p></p><p>There were no forced restrictions on cultivators or prohibitions on discussing related topics. </p><p></p><p>They simply issued a brief announcement to the world.</p><p></p><p>The next entrance examination for the alliance will be held half a year earlier.</p><p></p><p>To counter the fierce attacks of the Five Elders' Meeting, the number of recruits this time will increase by fifty percent compared to previous years.</p><p></p><p>The news shook the world!</p><p></p><p>Everyone hated privilege, yet everyone wanted to be privileged!</p><p></p><p>The various scandals circulating were cries against injustice.</p><p></p><p>But they were also excellent propaganda materials.</p><p></p><p>Do you want to be a victim in the event, or a superior being?</p><p></p><p>If you are interested, then come and apply!</p><p></p><p>With an almost fifty percent increase in the number of selection spots, the opportunities were also exponentially rising.</p><p></p><p>All alliance cultivators were eager to try their luck.</p>

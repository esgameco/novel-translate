        <h1>Chapter 960</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>According to the shape of Li Fan's soul, a tightly wrapped protective layer formed on the periphery.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it can be controlled effortlessly without refinement, it is simply tailored like a treasure, perfectly fitting the soul," Li Fan remarked.</p><p></p><p>"And..."</p><p></p><p>Squinting his eyes, Li Fan used the power of his soul to impact the layer of golden needles from the inside out.</p><p></p><p>As the soul impact collided with the protective layer, Li Fan felt a soft force dispersing him, followed by ripples spreading outwards towards the impact point.</p><p></p><p>The impact was evenly distributed, easily resolved.</p><p></p><p>If the protective layer had such a strong protective force internally, it was logical that its external toughness was even more formidable.</p><p></p><p>After continuous experimentation, Li Fan gave the evaluation of "as firm as golden soup".</p><p></p><p>"However, the protection of the golden needles is limited to the soul aspect. If it is pure physical harm, its protective function is actually inferior to ordinary armor treasures."</p><p></p><p>"Needles unbroken, person unharmed..."</p><p></p><p>"The words of the Heavenly Physician are not exaggerated. As long as the soul is intact, with his strength, helping to reshape the flesh is but a simple matter."</p><p></p><p>"And to destroy the soul, the first step is to break through the protection of the golden needles."</p><p></p><p>"Even..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a scene flashed in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>At the moment of a fatal blow, just before the golden needles were about to shatter, a golden light rose into the sky, carrying Li Fan's soul and flew back into the hands of the Heavenly Physician.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could be sure that the Heavenly Physician still had certain control over the sent golden needles.</p><p></p><p>While this was undoubtedly due to the care for the "sole current inheritor of the Heavenly Law Realm," it was not a good thing for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>How could one rest peacefully beside their enemy?</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's character, he couldn't possibly allow something he couldn't fully control to wrap around his soul.</p><p></p><p>As for others, it was fine, but if his soul was frozen and he couldn't return, it would truly be a disaster!</p><p></p><p>"Is there a way to enjoy the protection of the golden needles while ensuring absolute safety..."</p><p></p><p>In front of the faceless statue, Li Fan began to ponder.</p><p></p><p>In fact, at present, he had few trump cards that could restrain the power of the Heavenly Physician, and they were all uncontrollable variables.</p><p></p><p>Such as chaos, hunger, gray mold, etc.</p><p></p><p>One slip could lead to catastrophic consequences.</p><p></p><p>After much consideration, Li Fan ultimately focused on the golden wish power generated by the faceless statue.</p><p></p><p>The golden wish power had been stored in Li Fan's lifeblood for some time, and whenever it was almost full, it could compress on its own without Li Fan's manipulation.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, despite the tremendous accumulation of golden wish power during this time, it still couldn't fill even one lifeblood vessel.</p><p></p><p>However, this lifeblood vessel with Li Fan's appearance looked dazzling and sacred.</p><p></p><p>The golden wish power was a existence beyond the levels of power systems Li Fan currently accessed, and he had not yet found a way to use it.</p><p></p><p>The only thing he could do was guide it.</p><p></p><p>"Wish power, wish power..."</p><p></p><p>"Could invoking it according to what is in the heart unleash its power?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a thought suddenly and began to try.</p><p></p><p>The result was obvious - it seemed like they were completely different species, and the golden wish power was indifferent to Li Fan's call.</p><p></p><p>After unsuccessful attempts, Li Fan had to change his approach.</p><p></p><p>He created another lifeblood vessel and slowly guided the golden wish power into it. At the same time, he triggered the transformation of the lifeblood vessel into a long rope-like form.</p><p></p><p>Like a pipeline, carrying the slowly moving golden wish power.</p><p></p><p>As this pipeline wound around the golden needle protection enveloping Li Fan's soul, it slowly weaved into an outer garment.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the process, Li Fan was extremely cautious.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Heavenly Physician's golden needles or the golden wish power, they were powers he currently could not control.</p><p></p><p>Only by guiding them, forming a mutual constraint between the two, could he feel a bit at ease.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, doing so outside his soul was extremely dangerous.</p><p></p><p>The slightest mistake could lead to the complete destruction of his soul.</p><p></p><p>But since the means were available, Li Fan still had the qualification to boldly try!</p><p></p><p>"If things really change, these two must be the first to spot each other's colossal presence. Subconsciously ignoring me as a mere ant. It's human nature."</p><p></p><p>"It's safer for me to face either of them alone than both together."</p><p></p><p>"This is the way of balance."</p><p></p><p>If the Heavenly Physician's golden needles erupted, they would definitely first trigger the golden wish power.</p><p></p><p>And vice versa.</p><p></p><p>If Li Fan were to be struck by an external fatal blow, the assailant would face the dual counterattacks of the Heavenly Physician's golden needles and the golden wish power.</p><p></p><p>Inappropriately put, Li Fan was currently akin to having two linked bombs attached to him.</p><p></p><p>Any act that could harm Li Fan would completely set off the bombs.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan believed that even the Longevity Heavenly Venerable would not fare well under the simultaneous attacks of these two forces!</p><p></p><p>And in times of necessity, Li Fan could even voluntarily detonate these two bombs, achieving unexpected results!</p><p></p><p>"Utilizing circumstances in the situation and navigating through it. Revealing my true nature..."</p><p></p><p>When the balance between the two forces was finally achieved, Li Fan quietly admired his masterpiece, feeling somewhat proud.</p><p></p><p>However, he soon came back to reality.</p><p></p><p>"This is just a temporary expedient, if I can research thoroughly the Heavenly Physician's golden needles and form a soul protection of my own..."</p><p></p><p>"Since the Heavenly Physician can achieve this, there is no reason I can't."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully felt the energy attributes of the Heavenly Physician's golden needles outside his soul, combined with the content of the "Heavenly Physician's Scripture" and the "Sky-Repairing Record", silently pondering.</p><p></p><p>As such, it was uncertain for how long he pondered.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was startled awake by an image in his mind.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the task he had given the followers of Red Dust Compassionate Immortal to find someone who could restore a cultivator's appearance based on their skull finally had some progress.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Fan thought it would be a simple matter, but in reality, in the vast Xuanhuang Realm, besides himself, there was truly no one else with such a need.</p><p></p><p>Since there was no practical value in usage, cultivators did not delve into this technique.</p><p></p><p>Only after Li Fan issued the mission and offered rewards did cultivators attempt to do so.</p><p></p><p>"Tong Yanzhou, Luo Sizhen."</p><p></p><p>After grasping the information of the targeted cultivator, Li Fan thought for a moment and ultimately decided to personally take action.</p><p></p><p>As it concerned something Luo Sizhen highly desired, it had to be taken seriously.</p><p></p><p>His figure flew swiftly, ethereal.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Li Fan arrived at Luo Sizhen's cave mansion.</p>

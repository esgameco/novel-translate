        <h1>Chapter 863</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In his hand surged a pure and extremely colorful brilliance. </p><p></p><p>Encasing the one-eyed little man inside. </p><p></p><p>This colorful divine light, after being repeatedly and deliberately compressed by Li Fan. </p><p></p><p>The seven colors of light were almost merging into one. </p><p></p><p>Turning into a dazzling white light. </p><p></p><p>Like holding a sun in his hand, illuminating the entire surrounding void with intense brightness. </p><p></p><p>The yellow paper figure in the white light seemed to become somewhat distorted due to immense pressure. </p><p></p><p>But Li Fan continued to increase the output of the colorful divine light. </p><p></p><p>With the Five Elements Heavenly Realm as a backup, even the damaged colorful jade light could maximize its original power. </p><p></p><p>The colorful divine light does not belong to the realm of Xuanyellow. </p><p></p><p>As it began to condense, it began to repel all external objects. </p><p></p><p>The yellow one-eyed paper man seemed to finally sense the danger. </p><p></p><p>Its eyes turned rapidly, looking at Li Fan. </p><p></p><p>It seemed to have an intention to communicate. </p><p></p><p>But Li Fan completely ignored it. </p><p></p><p>Without any intention of stopping, he increased the output power of the colorful divine light once again. </p><p></p><p>Finally, when a point of white brilliance reached its limit. </p><p></p><p>Like a violent explosion that occurred when the world was created, in the dazzling fire, the yellow paper figure was completely burned away. </p><p></p><p>The weight on his heart finally lifted, Li Fan let out a sigh of relief and slowly retracted the colorful divine light back into his body. </p><p></p><p>He had just ascended to the Yuan Infant stage and had not completely refined the colorful jade light. </p><p></p><p>The recent actions were actually somewhat overwhelming for Li Fan. </p><p></p><p>But finally destroying this method of the Dutuo Sect was worth it. </p><p></p><p>"Eternal Calamity World, seeking the one to endure calamity." </p><p></p><p>"It seems that the yellow one-eyed paper man is their way of finding the one to endure calamity." </p><p></p><p>"No wonder they are a sect that uses 'enduring calamity' as a cultivation resource." </p><p></p><p>"Ordinary spells simply cannot touch these paper figures, let alone destroy them." </p><p></p><p>"..." </p><p></p><p>"I wonder where these old folks are hiding." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned slightly. </p><p></p><p>After much consideration, he still had no clue. </p><p></p><p>Deciding to put this matter aside for now. </p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Heavenly Realm had already been swallowed into Li Fan's body, and the passage that had changed the coordinates naturally became ineffective. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan was actually in the void of Tianlingzhou. </p><p></p><p>When he concealed his breath, tore through the void, and returned to the Xuanyellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>A chilling feeling suddenly emerged from his heart. </p><p></p><p>Li Fan raised his head and looked towards the sky. </p><p></p><p>Whether it was his illusion or not, Li Fan seemed to see countless yellow one-eyed paper figures made of paper distributed in every corner of the Xuanyellow Realm. </p><p></p><p>Unnoticed by anyone, they silently stared with their single eyes, observing the world. </p><p></p><p>When Li Fan broke through the void back to the Xuanyellow Realm, they seemed to sense the perpetrator who had destroyed one of their kind. </p><p></p><p>All their eyes turned towards Li Fan! </p><p></p><p>The moment his body stiffened as all eyes locked onto him, Li Fan's body instantly froze. </p><p></p><p>However, before he could even breathe, those gazes naturally disappeared. </p><p></p><p>From start to finish, it was as if it were just Li Fan's illusion. </p><p></p><p>His frozen body gradually returned to normal, but Li Fan's expression didn't relax. </p><p></p><p>He knew that the scene that just happened was not an illusion. </p><p></p><p>In the Xuanyellow Realm, it had been infested by these Dutuo Sect members and their surveillance eyes!</p><p></p><p>And almost no one knew about it!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but think that even he, a mortal, near the edge of the Great Abyss, was also suddenly awakened by this illusion. </p><p></p><p>Escaping a disaster. </p><p></p><p>Does this mean...</p><p></p><p>That even the Xuanyellow Realm is dotted with fixed yellow one-eyed paper figures?</p><p></p><p>Thinking about his actions and realizing that they may have been scrutinized by these Dutuo Sect cultivators behind the scenes, a chill ran through Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>But having experienced so much, he didn't lose his composure. </p><p></p><p>After some analysis, he gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>First of all, it could be confirmed that each one-eyed paper figure's surveillance range was not too large. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it wouldn't require so many paper talismans to cover the entire Xuanyellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, besides monitoring, these Dutuo Sect talismans probably didn't have any other functions.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Thousand Immortals Union and the Five Elders Council must also be aware of the existence of these yellow paper talismans.</p><p></p><p>But destroying them wouldn't be an easy task.</p><p></p><p>So, more probably, they chose to turn a blind eye.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the headquarters of the Ten Thousand Immortals Union is built within the Tianxuan Mirror, not in the Xuanyellow Realm." </p><p></p><p>"It's probably to avoid being watched by these yellow paper figures." </p><p></p><p>"And Zhao Senior Sister's One Mind Immortal Sect is also in a separate space." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled his encounter when he was almost led to the One Mind Immortal Sect. </p><p></p><p>"The Dutuo Sect is really low-quality." </p><p></p><p>In his life journey, Li Fan had encountered figures like Ink Kill, Divine Healer, Ruomu, Mr. Bai, True Immortals, and more. </p><p></p><p>Although every encounter was fraught with danger, Li Fan held deep respect for these true powerhouses. </p><p></p><p>Even if he died at their hands due to a mistake, he wouldn't hold any resentment. </p><p></p><p>But this time, Li Fan was genuinely disgusted.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who discovered the Xuanyellow Realm filled with these paper talismans wouldn't feel good at all.</p><p></p><p>Even during the 114th era when the Abyssal Net descended, it was openly done. </p><p></p><p>The green sky, though somewhat eerie, was definitely much better than being plastered with these paper patches that obscured heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the brief glimpse just now, a thought emerged in Li Fan's mind to completely clear them out.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>It was just wishful thinking.</p><p></p><p>After so many years, since the Ten Thousand Immortals Union had tolerated the existence of these paper figures, it seemed clear that eradicating them completely was no easy task. </p><p></p><p>After all, who would be willing to live under the watchful eyes of others every day?</p><p></p><p>"It seems I have to put other matters aside for now." </p><p></p><p>"At the very least, I must first address this constant surveillance issue." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a hint of doubt arose in his heart. </p><p></p><p>What did these Dutuo Sect members really want to achieve? </p><p></p><p>Li Fan had experienced many endings in the Xuanyellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>He had even witnessed the destruction of worlds. </p><p></p><p>Yet he had never seen a true Dutuo Sect cultivator present.</p><p></p><p>"Are they waiting for the appearance of the one to endure calamity and for the calamity to be over completely?"</p><p></p><p>Feeling the faint, elusive gazes transmitted from the surroundings, Li Fan's thoughts fluctuated.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he flew towards Jiu Mountain Prefecture.</p>

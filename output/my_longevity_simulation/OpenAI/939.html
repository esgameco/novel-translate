        <h1>Chapter 939</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>These cultivators with strange attire and equipment were different from the projections summoned from the Immortal Sect's arsenal. They had no combat skills to speak of, relying solely on their tools to gain the upper hand in battle.</p><p></p><p>However, these cultivators had a strange characteristic: they were fearless of death. If a companion was killed, they not only did not feel sadness or pain, but instead, their faces would show expressions of mockery and laughter. Even when facing their own death, they did not feel fear, only regret and dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>With the combined resistance of various rebellious forces, the offensive of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance was resisted, and there were signs of the front line being pushed back. At this time, the decision made by the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance was somewhat unexpected. Instead of stubbornly persisting and continuing to attack, they chose to retreat and regroup in an orderly manner, covering each other as they withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the screen of the Tianxuan Mirror was interrupted. The stark contrast of this moment caused dissatisfaction among the cultivators watching the live broadcast in front of the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Is this it? They retreat over a small setback?"</p><p></p><p>"Why retreat if there's still a fight to be had?"</p><p></p><p>"So afraid of death? You won't fight, but I will! Let me go to the battlefield!"</p><p></p><p>"Who gave the retreat order? Truly despicable!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Despite the fervor of the crowd, they could not change the decision on the battlefield. That day, the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance issued another announcement, stating that the recent battles were a demonstration of their own strength and a warning to the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>The previous promise remained unchanged; if the Five Elders Council was willing to hand over the treasures of the Immortal Alliance, negotiations could continue. If they remained obstinate, the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance might pay them a visit sooner or later.</p><p></p><p>Whether it's war or peace, it's up to the Five Elders Council to decide!</p><p></p><p>Obviously, this announcement was a blatant threat. In the past, the Five Elders Council would have simply ignored it or even responded with their own announcements filled with sarcasm and defiance. But times had changed.</p><p></p><p>The surprise attack by the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance had shaken them. Other means of negotiation were acceptable, but the fact that the massive net of the Celestial Lord Law manifested by the Tianzun Law Image could affect the five immortal lords was astonishing!</p><p></p><p>Unlike the legendary status of the Transmission Tianzun in the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance, the five celestial lords were real figures who ruled and managed the Five Elders Council. They had the authority to issue commands called "Celestial Decrees" periodically. Needless to say, the impact of their weapons causing harm to these divine-like figures weighed heavily on their minds.</p><p></p><p>In the chaotic aftermath of the surprise attack by the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance, the Five Elders Council launched a counterattack and temporarily repelled them. However, with the authority of the celestial lords not fully restored, confusion still reigned within the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators, accustomed to the laws of the celestial lords, found themselves exposed for the first time in the authentic mysterious yellow realm without the presence of the celestial lords.</p><p></p><p>The impact on them was profound.</p><p></p><p>For instance, when the cultivators of the Kingdom of Reality suddenly discovered that they could lie in an environment where everyone subconsciously believed there were no lies, the power of deceit became destructive. After experiencing the benefits of lying, the use of deceit spread rapidly in the once truthful Kingdom of Reality. It was foreseeable that this chaos would persist until the power of the celestial tribes was restored.</p><p></p><p>"Might makes right."</p><p></p><p>The current strength of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance was capable of dealing a fatal blow to the Five Elders Council, forcing them to admit defeat.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, the Five Elders Council was unaware that all thirty-three Immortal Selectees capable of invoking the Celestial Lord Law Image had sacrificed themselves. From their perspective, the Celestial Lord Law Image and the Celestial Selectees were assets that could be utilized at any time.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, a delegation of over a dozen cultivators from the Five Elders Council arrived at the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance. Officially, their visit was for friendly negotiations, but in reality, it was a humiliating plea for peace.</p><p></p><p>They indeed brought the so-called "Treasures of the Immortal Alliance," which caused ridicule among the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance cultivators for quite some time.</p><p></p><p>The negotiation process lasted for seven days, and the specifics of the agreement reached were unknown to the public. However, it was evident that the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance was satisfied with the price the Five Elders Council paid. There were no further demands for justice.</p><p></p><p>After the delegation from the Five Elders Council left, a large-scale rewarding ceremony began. The black-clad cultivators, without mentioning the details, introduced at length the commander-in-chief of the recent conquest of the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>The Transmission Master, Jiang.</p><p></p><p>He played a crucial role in the surprise attack, devising the Celestial Lord Law Image and the Celestial Selectees. This was the first time the Transmission Master appeared publicly in front of the masses of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the widely circulated figure, a thin middle-aged man who did not stand out much in appearance, except for the prominent goatee on his chin. "It's strange that the usually low-key Transmission Master chose to reveal himself actively," Li Fan furrowed his brows in confusion. This had never happened in the previous cycles.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan speculated that it might be related to the incident involving the ink scholar, Mo Rubin, who had been possessed by the young Transmission Master. Power struggles among the Transmission Masters were not unheard of. Mo Rubin had attempted to control the Tianxuan Mirror through a formation, possibly triggering a sense of crisis in some. Therefore, by achieving merit in this expedition, they were securing their positions.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan felt that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>The plans involving the Celestial Lord Law Image and the Selectees had been in motion for some time. Mo Rubin posing as the Transmission Master was only a recent development.</p><p></p><p>"Or maybe..."</p><p></p><p>"Is it really for that so-called 'Treasures of the Immortal Alliance'?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's attention suddenly focused on this perceived 'excuse' that all cultivators of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance believed in. "If true, what is it that is worth the considerable effort that the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance has put in?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that it's time for our Universal Alliance to take action again."</p><p></p><p>With this thought in mind, Li Qing felt something and once again left the Spirit Wood Realm, heading straight towards the territory of the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>With the Celestial Lord Law Image already depleted and the imprint left by Li Fan on the defensive formation at the border dismantled using the 'End Times Disintegration Disc,' Li Qing encountered no trouble along the way.</p><p></p><p>The recent victory of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance had evidently led to a relaxation of vigilance, making it easy for Li Qing to pierce the defense line and infiltrate the Five Elders Council. As she passed through several border states left ravaged by the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance, her divine sense swept by, unable to find even half a living soul.</p><p></p><p>Continuously displaying the covert art of contact, she advanced towards the heartland of the Five Elders Council. Only after crossing five states did cultivators gradually appear in her path.</p>

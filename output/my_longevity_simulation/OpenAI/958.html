        <h1>Chapter 958</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>With such thoughts in mind, Li Fan once again separated a strand of divine consciousness and entered the interior of the blue light sphere.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly influenced by Li Fan's provocation just now, the speed of the black light circulating on the blue and white round pearl belonging to Han Hai increased several times faster than before.</p><p></p><p>As if stirring up a fierce storm, the blue and white round pearl became somewhat chaotic.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Han Hai constantly increased the frequency and intensity of releasing shockwaves outward as his emotions became increasingly unstable.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that it is indeed because of the torment of nightmares over the years and the longing for revenge that has led to such emotional instability."</p><p></p><p>Like a compassionate healer working for the world's benefit, Li Fan began contemplating how to solve Han Hai's illness.</p><p></p><p>In treating illnesses, they were mostly similar.</p><p></p><p>Throughout history, people like Han Hai, who are unable to let go of hatred from the past, are not uncommon.</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long for Li Fan to find a solution.</p><p></p><p>During the interval when the shockwaves subsided, Li Fan's strand of divine consciousness once again rushed into the black storm on the pearl.</p><p></p><p>The nightmare scene of endless reincarnation continued.</p><p></p><p>However, it seemed that due to Han Hai's extreme emotional instability, all the scenes Li Fan saw from a first-person perspective were now tinted with a black and yellow filter.</p><p></p><p>And they were constantly trembling.</p><p></p><p>Causing the gruesome slaughter scenes to appear even more sinister and terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan lurked in the shadows, quietly waiting for the "plot" to develop.</p><p></p><p>Soon, it came time for Han Hai to uncover the real identity of the murderer.</p><p></p><p>Han Hai's body trembled slightly, his face showing an expression of disbelief, "Tianyi? You are Tianyi!?"</p><p></p><p>The murderer also cooperated well, revealing a strange smile, "Hehe, that's right. I am Tianyi!"</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving the answer, Han Hai's whole body was filled with rage, his eyes wide with anger.</p><p></p><p>Just as his mind was about to be consumed by anger...</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a cold and piercing voice suddenly sounded in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Elusive but piercing like a downpour, it instantly put out Han Hai's endless rage, "Don't be fooled by him!"</p><p></p><p>"Take a closer look, who is he really?!"</p><p></p><p>"This person is utterly unscrupulous and incredibly cruel. How could such a villain easily admit to his true identity?"</p><p></p><p>"Wake up! The heavy burden of revenge lies solely on you! There can be no mistakes!"</p><p></p><p>Amid continuous murmurs, Han Hai couldn't help but shudder.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes..."</p><p></p><p>"How could he admit his identity as soon as I asked?"</p><p></p><p>"There must be something fishy..."</p><p></p><p>"Who are you really? Who are you?!"</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by these mutterings, Han Hai looked again at the murderer before him.</p><p></p><p>To his shock, because of his suspicions, the other party's appearance and aura indeed changed once again.</p><p></p><p>No longer resembling Tianyi, but transformed into the stern and solemn figure of the respected Tianyu Elder!</p><p></p><p>"No, how could Tianyu Elder do such a thing?!"</p><p></p><p>Frantically shaking his head, Han Hai seemed to want to dispel this terrible thought from his mind.</p><p></p><p>And as his doubts accumulated, the appearance of the murderer kept changing.</p><p></p><p>"Tianyuan Elder? Tianyin Elder? Tianyi..."</p><p></p><p>The only constant was the aura representing the authority of the Tianfa Realm.</p><p></p><p>An enemy within arm's reach but powerless to seek revenge. It was already a tragic situation.</p><p></p><p>Yet, even more tragic was not knowing the true identity of the enemy.</p><p></p><p>Unable to find a specific target for revenge.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings began to shake more violently, and in the black and yellow filter, cracks began to appear.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Han Hai could no longer bear this torment.</p><p></p><p>The scene shattered with a bang.</p><p></p><p>A powerful energy burst buried everything in this nightmare.</p><p></p><p>"It's done!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought so before his consciousness disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In Han Hai's residence, beyond the blue light sphere.</p><p></p><p>With Han Hai's spirit temporarily breaking down, the shockwaves that had been sporadically released, destroying seals and prohibitions, finally ceased.</p><p></p><p>"However, with the passage of time, he will probably find a new target for vengeance again."</p><p></p><p>"Well... It's estimated that it will still be Tianyi."</p><p></p><p>For thousands of years, it was evident that Tianyi had cured Han Hai countless times. Otherwise, given the torment he had experienced, it would be impossible to remain fairly lucid.</p><p></p><p>Yet, each time it ended up with Tianyi being identified as the culprit...</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps in Han Hai's subconscious, among the Elders of the Tianfa Realm back then, only Tianyi was most likely to commit such a heinous act."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan confirmed the reason for this phenomenon to occur.</p><p></p><p>And Han Hai's understanding was something Li Fan could comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Because the methods of treatment described in the "Heavenly Record" and "Heavenly Doctor's Scripture" were somewhat contradictory to normal people's values.</p><p></p><p>More extreme than "fighting poison with poison."</p><p></p><p>Their ultimate goal was to cure and achieve objectives, without consideration for the means...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's treatment of Han Hai this time could almost be summarized as "deception."</p><p></p><p>Although Han Hai would no longer feel the suffering caused by hatred, he would still be immersed in endless confusion.</p><p></p><p>Treated, yet not completely cured.</p><p></p><p>But at the very least, the initial "symptom" that Li Fan needed to treat was indeed resolved.</p><p></p><p>This was the way of the Heavenly Doctor, a recurring theme.</p><p></p><p>It might conflict with the values of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan had no psychological barriers employing it.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Doctor..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered slightly as he calmed his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Confirming the effectiveness of his treatment, he knew that Han Hai wouldn't challenge the seals again in the short term.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Li Fan begin the work of repairing the prohibitions.</p><p></p><p>The prohibitions of "Hidden World Concealment" were incredibly intricate.</p><p></p><p>Regarding prohibitions, Li Fan had only dabbled in them during his past reincarnations.</p><p></p><p>But once you learn one law, you learn all laws. Formations, prohibitions, they share many similarities.</p><p></p><p>What Tianyi taught was extremely detailed.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the process, there were hardly any omissions.</p><p></p><p>Half a month passed, and the loosened seals were finally reinforced.</p><p></p><p>The Yunshui Heavenly Palace once again fell into absolute silence.</p><p></p><p>"For them, perhaps eternal slumber is the best conclusion."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan lamented in his heart, placing a jug of wine gently at the feet of the Qin Tang statue.</p><p></p><p>Then, he swiftly flew away, quietly leaving the place.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Yunshui Heavenly Palace, the anomaly that had appeared in the sky had vanished.</p><p></p><p>Returning to its former peace.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Li Fan couldn't think of a way to contact Tianyi.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 905</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"The recorded scenes can generally be divided into two categories."</p><p></p><p>"Some of them are from the cultivators who fell here over the years. They are of little value."</p><p></p><p>"As for the rest..."</p><p></p><p>A hint of excitement flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It aligns with my previous speculation, they are all from the same person."</p><p></p><p>"One of the twelve Law Kings of the Dark Heaven Sect, Ji Yuzhen!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's consciousness made contact with one of the light screens.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, as if experiencing it firsthand, many scenes came rolling in.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanyuan Big Brother? Haven't you ascended already?" A soft female voice came from herself, looking at the figure that suddenly appeared in front of her, Ji Yuzhen seemed very shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it seems like you are still the same, always closed off in cultivation and not inquiring about worldly affairs. I've been back for a while." The man in front had a firm face, his eyes as bright as the stars in the sky. His tone was very gentle, calming to listen to.</p><p></p><p>"This Xuanyuan should be the King of the Dark Heaven. Although he doesn't have the stunning beauty of Mr. Bai on the outside, he is also exceptionally rare." Li Fan secretly thought.</p><p></p><p>The King of the Dark Heaven first sighed, then seriously said to Ji Yuzhen, "Zhen'er, I want to do something. It may lead to enmity with people in the world, are you willing to follow me?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Yuzhen was stunned for a moment, then hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly stood up, the spiritual power swirling around her caused ripples of white clouds to appear on the surrounding mountaintops. "Okay!"</p><p></p><p>The King of the Dark Heavens was somewhat amazed, "Don't you want to know what it is?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Yuzhen stared at the King of the Dark Heavens for a moment, smiled slightly, and shook her head.</p><p></p><p>Exiting the scene, Li Fan furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>Then he continued to browse the second complete scene.</p><p></p><p>In a dim underground secret room.</p><p></p><p>The King of the Dark Heavens was recounting his experiences after ascending and the observation of the deviation phenomenon in the Xuanyuan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Twelve figures were dispersed in various corners of the secret room.</p><p></p><p>Their expressions were just like their faces, hidden in the shadows, unable to be seen.</p><p></p><p>"It concerns the safety of countless beings in the Xuanyuan Realm, we must not sit idly by. Xuanyuan Hong, you can do as you wish, even if this old man has to risk his life, he will assist you with all his might." A hoary voice rang out first.</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Hong arched his hand towards the old man, his expression solemn, "Elder Cui, very righteous!"</p><p></p><p>Some people there echoed along.</p><p></p><p>But there were also a few who remained expressionless, unfazed.</p><p></p><p>Ji Yuzhen's eyes were locked onto Xuanyuan Hong throughout.</p><p></p><p>In the cramped secret room.</p><p></p><p>"Zhen'er, I have selected the most suitable technique for you from those immortal scriptures."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Limitless Heaven's Pivot Divine Art.'"</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Hong was extremely excited, "This technique is extremely extraordinary, something I have rarely seen in my life. Merging body and soul until reaching an infinite state..."</p><p></p><p>He unceasingly explained the marvels of the technique to Ji Yuzhen.</p><p></p><p>While Ji Yuzhen just smiled quietly, listening attentively.</p><p></p><p>On a bloody battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Ji Yuzhen transformed into thousands of wandering soul fragments. Each soul turned into a phantom light and took away the life of an opposing cultivator.</p><p></p><p>While reaping the lives of enemies, Ji Yuzhen's gaze inadvertently looked towards Xuanyuan Hong in the distance on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Seeing him facing attacks from several Immortal Realm cultivators without changing his expression.</p><p></p><p>With an ancient and simple mirror above his head emitting a deep light, entrapping all the enemies within.</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Hong raised his eyebrows, softly exclaiming, "Invincible by Law!"</p><p></p><p>A glow flashed across him.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the attacks from the five Immortal Realm cultivators on Xuanyuan Hong all seemed to miss, having no effect at all.</p><p></p><p>"Bodily Mighty!" Xuanyuan Hong spoke again.</p><p></p><p>Softly extending his hand, he silently opened up the space above his head, suddenly capturing a massive seal that almost occupied half of the sky's space.</p><p></p><p>"Eyes like torches!"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the five surrounding him, every cultivator Xuanyuan Hong gazed at had a golden chain mysteriously appearing and tightly binding them!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the tide of battle turned!</p><p></p><p>"Heaven's Way!" Xuanyuan Hong's tone was stern, and it seemed like he had gained a majestic authority at that moment.</p><p></p><p>He fixed his eyes on the five ferocious-faced Immortal Realm cultivators, and with a flick of his body, he instantly appeared above their heads.</p><p></p><p>Lifting his left foot, he forcefully stepped down.</p><p></p><p>As if an invisible ripple enveloped the five cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Their expressions changed from resentment to panic, and then fear.</p><p></p><p>But Xuanyuan Hong showed no mercy.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the bodies of the five cultivators melted away like ice, disappearing into thin air.</p><p></p><p>Leaving only the virtual image of five fruits, emitting a strange brilliance.</p><p></p><p>With a gentle wave of his hand, Xuanyuan Hong turned these five fruits into five beams of light, disappearing into the air.</p><p></p><p>The battle ended completely with the fall of the five Immortal Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In a space resembling an endless starry sky.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanyuan Big Brother, is this the Floating Crossing Starry Formation?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the scene in front of her, Ji Yuzhen couldn't help but laugh, "It looks so ugly!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Hong remained calm, "As long as it can function, it's fine."</p><p></p><p>In front of the two, countless golden chains wrapped tightly around the Xuanyuan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Resembling a golden flat ball, floating in the air.</p><p></p><p>The chains were not entirely still. Seemingly revolving around a core inside, constantly moving.</p><p></p><p>The golden chains were adorned with countless complex runes.</p><p></p><p>"Now, let's start the first capture attempt."</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of nervousness in Xuanyuan Hong's tone.</p><p></p><p>With his words, in the space ahead, thousands of stars seemed to suddenly light up hundreds of them.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>With a slight point, a chain flew out from the golden ball.</p><p></p><p>Flying straight towards a target star.</p><p></p><p>The chain entered the void silently.</p><p></p><p>Without any response.</p><p></p><p>It seemed lost in the endless void.</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Hong kept concentrating.</p><p></p><p>Only after several days did he shake his head somewhat regrettably, "There has been a deviation between the observation mark and the actual position."</p><p></p><p>"This capture has failed."</p><p></p><p>He then pointed, and the golden chains shooting towards the void began to return.</p><p></p><p>"Deviation? Is it due to the influence of that unknown suction force?" Ji Yuzhen asked softly.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed. Not just our cultivation world, but soon, perhaps the entire space-time will inevitably be affected by it."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Hong sighed, "We must hasten our progress."</p><p></p><p>"Xuanyuan Big Brother, let me heal your wounds."</p><p></p><p>In the enclosed space, Ji Yuzhen split a divine soul, flying towards Xuanyuan Hong.</p>

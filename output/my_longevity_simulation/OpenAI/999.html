        <h1>Chapter 999</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>What's left is endless knowledge of Array Dao.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when Li Fan, who became the master of Lixi Chan, had his soul collide with Lixi Chan herself, it did not cause much resistance.</p><p></p><p>Instead, Li Fan felt a sense of fear coming from Lixi Chan.</p><p></p><p>Countless images flashed in Lixi Chan's soul, mingling between reality and falsehood.</p><p></p><p>The faces of Lixia and Li Fan kept changing, the speed getting faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>In the end, only the face of Li Fan remained, firmly imprinted in the depths of Lixi Chan's soul.</p><p></p><p>With the power of the true inducing fruit, it completely dissolved.</p><p></p><p>After a violent twitch, Lixi Chan's body gradually returned to calm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan retracted the power of his soul, the long-term and large-scale transfer of soul consuming too much.</p><p></p><p>Even with the Infinite Regeneration of the Soul characteristic of the Infinite Yin and Yang Law, it was somewhat hard to bear for a while.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the matter was resolved.</p><p></p><p>In the recent blending of souls, Li Fan caught sight of many secrets in Lixi Chan's memory.</p><p></p><p>For example, Lixi Chan's master Lixia was never completely satisfied with her.</p><p></p><p>Until he fell, he had no hope that Lixi Chan could inherit his array master skills.</p><p></p><p>When he took in Lixi Chan as his disciple, including passing on her the position of Chief of the Array Hall, it was all done for some special reasons.</p><p></p><p>Although Lixia never explicitly stated it, Lixi Chan herself speculated that she might be Lixia's daughter.</p><p></p><p>However, she never had the courage to verify this speculation.</p><p></p><p>As Lixia's remains turned to ashes, the truth of this speculation could no longer be verified.</p><p></p><p>There were many more secrets to Lixi Chan.</p><p></p><p>For instance, due to living under the strict discipline of her master since childhood, she had been under immense psychological pressure.</p><p></p><p>In the process of finding ways to relieve this pressure, she discovered a fairly effective method.</p><p></p><p>And the reason why she often came to Xuan Sushang was because of this.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Li Fan's expression changed slightly: "So Lixue Jing's masochistic nature is actually inherited from her mother."</p><p></p><p>"This is really..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of Lixi Chan's daughter, Lixue Jing, it was also related to Xuan Sushang.</p><p></p><p>In a stress-relief encounter, Lixi Chan discovered that Xuan Sushang had somehow become pregnant.</p><p></p><p>Shocked by this revelation, Lixi Chan naturally could not accept it.</p><p></p><p>Under coercion, Xuan Sushang had to confess the truth.</p><p></p><p>"Te Lixi Chan, also conceived a daughter using the 'Life Law' taught by Tianxuan Jing?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted, casting a glance at Xuan Sushang beside him.</p><p></p><p>Lixi Chan entwined with Xuan Sushang, also gave birth to a daughter using the 'Life Law.'</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the human incarnation of Tianxuan Jing is indeed related to the Mirror Holder."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes, slowly digesting the wealth of information he had just gained.</p><p></p><p>While restoring the depleted soul.</p><p></p><p>Once he was almost completely restored, Li Fan, following the same procedure, attacked Xuan Sushang's soul.</p><p></p><p>Being the direct descendant of the Mirror Holder, Xuan Sushang was stronger in both soul power and prohibition defense than Lixi Chan.</p><p></p><p>However, sadly, there were no qualitative changes, only quantitative adjustments.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan persisted in this meticulous effort, blending in Lixi Chan's soul aura, along with the true fruit inducing power.</p><p></p><p>The defense line was breached in an instant, making it easier for Li Fan to distort the cognition.</p><p></p><p>Thus, in addition to Lixi Chan's master, Li Fan acquired another identity.</p><p></p><p>Another incarnation of the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>When the Law Transmission Master re-established the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance, the Tianxuan Mirror, being cautious, had already created a human clone for himself.</p><p></p><p>However, unfortunately, Law Transmission Master had his suspicions about Tianxuan Jing and discovered this clone.</p><p></p><p>The clone was suppressed.</p><p></p><p>From then on, Tianxuan Mirror lost contact with its clone.</p><p></p><p>Forced to do so, Tianxuan Mirror had to restart the cloning project.</p><p></p><p>But unbeknownst to them, Lixi Chan's master and former Chief of the Array Hall of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance, Lixia, had coincidentally discovered the seal of the Law Transmission Master.</p><p></p><p>By a stroke of luck, Lixia managed to rescue the suppressed clone.</p><p></p><p>Having been suppressed for too long at that time, the clone of Tianxuan Mirror was already in dire straits, so Lixia voluntarily sacrificed his life to save it.</p><p></p><p>Although it came alive again, having been suppressed too long and with a different body, the clone had lost its abilities as the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Becoming no different from a real human.</p><p></p><p>Thinking he could just live on as a human, Lixia never expected that living in the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance headquarters and the lingering connection with the Tianxuan Mirror would eventually be discovered by some.</p><p></p><p>To save himself, he had to fake his death and escape.</p><p></p><p>Thinking he could continue living freely, he never expected that a new clone of Tianxuan Mirror would be born due to a twist of fate.</p><p></p><p>What was even more deadly was that there could only be one Tianxuan Mirror in the world, hence there could not exist two human clones of the Tianxuan Mirror at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Although this erroneous birth was due to various accidents, it was in the process of being rectified.</p><p></p><p>He realized he was gradually weakening.</p><p></p><p>It was probably a matter of time before he completely dissipated from the world.</p><p></p><p>And the only way to survive was to find and kill the second clone of the Tianxuan Mirror!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>This was the massive deception concocted by Li Fan, dragging these two female cultivators and the clone of the Tianxuan Mirror into it.</p><p></p><p>Admittedly, upon closer examination, there were many loopholes.</p><p></p><p>But once he could extract the information about the human clone of Tianxuan Mirror from Xuan Sushang's mouth, all of this would be irrelevant even if exposed.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that all the information about Tianxuan Mirror seems to be encrypted."</p><p></p><p>"The soul cannot be browsed. Otherwise, there would be no need to fabricate such lies."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after completing the cognitive restructuring, Xuan Sushang and Lixi Chan gradually woke up.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan, their reactions differed.</p><p></p><p>Lixi Chan shuddered, instinctively lowered her head and muttered softly, "Master..."</p><p></p><p>While Xuan Sushang had a complex expression and remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Because when this former Chief Array Master and the human clone of the Tianxuan Mirror came looking for them, they happened to interrupt a private moment between her and Lixi Chan.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan didn't say much at the time, both women were embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the dead silence, Li Fan was the first to speak, "I have given you both a chance."</p><p></p><p>"I am still the second clone, so whom will you choose in the end?"</p><p></p><p>A glint of killing intent flashed in his eyes, as Li Fan said slowly, "If it weren't for Chan's sake, I would have probed your souls long ago. Do you think those little tricks in your souls can stop me?"</p><p></p><p>Lixi Chan dared not retort, not daring even to breathe heavily.</p>

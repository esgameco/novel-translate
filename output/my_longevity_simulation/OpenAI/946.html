            <p>"The more unattainable something is, the more we desire it."</p><p></p><p>"So, if you want to completely quell the greed in your heart, you just need to fulfill all the desires that are 'resting' in your heart all at once."</p><p></p><p>"Give yourself a long vacation. Long enough for you to have nothing to do, extremely bored..."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Li Fan's words, Little Lolita's eyes immediately lit up.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but say, "How can anyone feel so bored! If I didn't have to deduce the martial arts techniques, I would definitely sleep for decades first!"</p><p></p><p>Seemingly yearning for that beautiful holiday life, Little Lolita's face was full of longing.</p><p></p><p>However, she soon felt very discouraged, saying, "Ah, don't even talk about resting for decades. Even resting for ten days or half a month is very difficult."</p><p></p><p>"It's so good to not have to work!"</p><p></p><p>Recalling the happy times of slacking off earlier, Little Lolita couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>Then she glanced at Li Fan and complained, "It's all because of you, otherwise I could pretend for a bit longer."</p><p></p><p>"Avoiding the issue won't solve anything," Li Fan chuckled, "Solving the root cause of the problem is the correct path."</p><p></p><p>Little Lolita snorted, "It's easy for you to say. I made an agreement with the Supreme Transcendant back then that I need to deduce all the martial arts techniques in the world to completion before I can rest completely."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, at this speed, it will probably take thousands of years. It's really worrying me..."</p><p></p><p>Covering her mouth, Lolita sighed. _New 69 Shuba 28shu.com_</p><p></p><p>"If only I could find another deducer like me to help you deduce. Then you could rest, right?" At that moment, Saint Embryo Li Fan suddenly sighed.</p><p></p><p>Little Lolita gave Li Fan a disdainful look, "I am unique in this world, where else can you find another me!"</p><p></p><p>However, Little Lolita then paused, "If the me in thousands of years could directly hand over the deduced martial arts techniques to me, then I could pretend to be working while actually resting, right?"</p><p></p><p>Little Lolita's eyes were full of excitement, lost in fantasy.</p><p></p><p>Through the conversation with Deducter Jué, Saint Embryo Li Fan had gathered enough information.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he decisively spoke to wake the other person up, "I have explained your condition. I need the martial arts, right?"</p><p></p><p>Deducer Jué had no reaction at all, just staring blankly and chuckling foolishly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had to raise his voice and repeated himself.</p><p></p><p>It was then that Little Lolita woke up as if from a dream.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Li Fan with resentment, she complained, "Give me a bit more time to rest, really..."</p><p></p><p>"It will probably take some time before those guys come to urge us."</p><p></p><p>"And your martial arts are indeed more complicated, maybe I can take the opportunity to rest a bit more."</p><p></p><p>Waving his hand, let Li Fan wait a little longer.</p><p></p><p>Little Lolita zoned out again.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't say anything to stop her this time, instead turning his gaze to the countless martial arts floating around them. _New 69 Shuba 28shu.com_</p><p></p><p>Unlike when Deductor Jué pretended to sleep earlier, this time he could only see the names of the martial arts written on the book covers.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts themselves were bound by chains of characters, making them unreadable.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan gave up his idea of prying. He watched his breath, his nose, and his heart, patiently waiting for Little Lolita to rest to her fill.</p><p></p><p>A whole day passed, seemingly under the urging inquiries from the Wanjie, Deductor Jué finally woke up with a hint of regret.</p><p></p><p>"Ah..."</p><p></p><p>She reached out her small hand, and a book titled "Three Calamities and a Hundred Tribulations Bright Divine Law" appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, she had deduced it long ago.</p><p></p><p>"Take it, you should leave soon too."</p><p></p><p>"I hope the next person who deduces the martial arts will make it more difficult, so I can save some more free time."</p><p></p><p>In her words, Saint Embryo Li Fan returned to the character light ball space.</p><p></p><p>Once back, Deductor Jué became as listless and drowsy as before.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the faint warning in the other party's eyes, Li Fan suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>In reality, Deductor Jué's speed of deducing martial arts was far faster than her outward performance suggested.</p><p></p><p>Every martial art deduction could be quickly completed. Then she would have extra time to rest.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this was one of the reasons she could persist in deducing for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>The Guarding Hall of the Ten Thousand Immortal League was probably aware of this.</p><p></p><p>But pressing too hard might have a reverse effect. So they chose to turn a blind eye.</p><p></p><p>With the martial arts in hand, the purpose of this trip had been achieved.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan bid farewell to the white-haired elder.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving the headquarters of the Ten Thousand Immortal League, he expressed his desire to visit the "Museum of Divine Treasures.”</p><p></p><p>The white-haired elder was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>For him, visiting the treasure trove could be done at any time.</p><p></p><p>However, the token he gave represented a favor, which had many uses.</p><p></p><p>If left outside, countless cultivators would fight for it desperately.</p><p></p><p>Was it worth being wasted so easily?</p><p></p><p>"Young man, reconsider?" Even the white-haired elder himself felt it was a bit extravagant and couldn't help but advise.</p><p></p><p>"No need. I have made up my mind," Li Fan replied calmly.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired elder shook his head slightly and stopped trying to dissuade him.</p><p></p><p>After retrieving the token and seeing Li Fan off from the Guarding Hall, he instructed the escorting cultivator before returning to the Guarding Hall.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Li Fan followed behind the escorting cultivator and headed towards the Museum of Divine Treasures.</p><p></p><p>He had changed his mind this time and wanted to visit the Museum of Divine Treasures on a whim.</p><p></p><p>It was actually the intention of the original self.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, he wanted to take a look at the skull displayed in the center of the treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, during the time spent in the museum, he planned to memorize the "Three Calamities and a Hundred Tribulations Bright Divine Law."</p><p></p><p>It should be safe inside the treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>But once he left the headquarters of the Immortal League, that might not be the case.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his performance in the Guarding Hall had been somewhat out of line, so he might be targeted.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Fan had already decided that once he left the Immortal League headquarters, he would discard the Sacred Embryo to prevent being traced.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the Museum of Divine Treasures, memories about the collections surfaced.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the original self had been here before.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan still pretended as if it was his first visit.</p><p></p><p>Amazed, he secretly browsed through the "Three Calamities and a Hundred Tribulations Bright Divine Law" deduced by Deductor Jué.</p><p></p><p>The complexity of this martial art was not inferior to the Xuantian School’s Immortal Techniques.</p><p></p><p>However, its power was weaker, suitable for performance at the Harmonious Way Realm level.</p><p></p><p>But it should be enough to deceive and manipulate Mòrúbīn.</p><p></p><p>After memorizing the entire martial art, Li Fan nodded satisfactorily.</p><p></p><p>Immersed in the comprehension of the martial art, he finally came to the central area of the Museum of Divine Treasures and returned to his senses.</p><p></p><p>He gazed at the skull in front of him, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>It was no different from an ordinary human skull.</p>

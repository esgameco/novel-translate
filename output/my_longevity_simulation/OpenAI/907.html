        <h1>Chapter 907</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Sister Zhao's foundational technique is the 'Only Me Art through Eternal Antiquity.' As for the others..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps we can exchange with her using something."</p><p></p><p>"The One Heart Immortal Sect, the Great Dao is solely mine."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fansi had a plan in mind.</p><p></p><p>"I'll wait to speak after my doppelganger retrieves the Black Sword in the Sword Tomb. I have modified the soul of the doppelganger, erasing any memories related to Hanzhen. Even if the doppelganger gets lost or immersed in her illusion, there won't be much loss."</p><p></p><p>"But there's no need to rush within a year."</p><p></p><p>For now, let's leave this circular mountain. When Li Fansi was about to reach the Spirit Wood Realm, he suddenly stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>He looked in the direction of the central area of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he inexplicably sensed a connection in his Sea of Consciousness with the Endless Disintegration Discs, indicating the birth of nine new Disintegration Discs in this world.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps originally formed by the fusion of nine Disintegration Discs, the Ultimate Creation could now clearly sense the presence of the newly born Disintegration Discs, even if separated by thousands of miles.</p><p></p><p>Moreover...</p><p></p><p>Li Fansi even felt a sense of hunger and greed emanating from the Endless Disintegration Disc.</p><p></p><p>"The fusion of the nine discs into one has created a flawless genuine Disintegration Disc. If it can devour another one of itself..."</p><p></p><p>"To what extent will the Disintegration Disc evolve?"</p><p></p><p>Even though he had seen many treasures, Li Fansi couldn't help but be moved. Newùüîùüónovelbaùü®ùü´.shux(com)</p><p></p><p>There was no choice; the Disintegration Disc had been of great help to him.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang realm, where ancient monsters lurked everywhere, Li Fansi, despite his many lifetimes of reincarnation, still lacked any advantages compared to them in terms of heritage, cultivation, and divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Except for the Array...</p><p></p><p>With the accumulation of lifetime after lifetime and the existence of the Disintegration Disc, Li Fansi's proficiency in array techniques could crush others, almost surpassing an era and leading far ahead!</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, when he set up a recorded array in front of the Law Transmitters and the Law King of the Xuantian School, he went entirely unnoticed by both parties, confirming this point.</p><p></p><p>"To surpass in the realm of arrays, perhaps advancing early is possible."</p><p></p><p>"When an ordinary array is perfected, the next step is..."</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Grade Array!"</p><p></p><p>"There is a huge gap between the Immortal Grade Array and an ordinary array. For the Disintegration Disc to undergo this transformation, it needs data from at least one Immortal Grade Array..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fansi imagined the appearance of the Floating Starry Sky Great Array.</p><p></p><p>Originally designed by the Xuantian King Xuanyuan Hong, it carried the hope of bringing the Xuanhuang realm beyond the walls. This Floating Starry Sky Great Array was probably the closest thing in the Xuanhuang realm to an Immortal Grade Array.</p><p></p><p>"Although the array was damaged during the era of the Ten Sects of Immortals, there must still be remnants left. Newùüîùüónovelbaùü®ùü´‚ì¢hu‚ìß.co‚ìú"</p><p></p><p>"Even during the 114th era, the obelisks spread across the Xuanhuang Earth may be related to the Floating Starry Sky Great Array."</p><p></p><p>"Disintegration Disc, Floating Starry Sky Great Array..."</p><p></p><p>"All are top secrets that only the high ranks of the Immortal Alliance can touch."</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the path ahead in this world was already very clear.</p><p></p><p>That was to figure out a way to contact Morubin, gain his trust, and then, using his identity as a Law Transmitter, obtain various secrets that Li Fansi needed.</p><p></p><p>Compared to these, the advancement in cultivation was not as important.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fansi's current strength, as long as there were no accidents, he could come and go freely with no worries about his life.</p><p></p><p>The gap between Harmony and Longevity was too enormous, and even if Li Fansi broke through one or two realms above, he might still not be a match for Longevity Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it was better for him to take a different approach and work around the issue.</p><p></p><p>"Success or failure depends on Sister Zhao."</p><p></p><p>"But, one shouldn't put all their eggs in one basket."</p><p></p><p>With these thoughts in mind, Li Fansi returned to the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Shang Tianci came looking for him.</p><p></p><p>"Senior..." He hesitated, as if wanting to say something but hesitating.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"Yan Fangzhou's situation seems a bit unfavorable. Can we let him out?" Shang Tianci asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Li Fansi's expression remained unchanged, revealing no joy or anger. "I will handle this matter myself. You may go."</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci didn't dare to argue and could only bow and leave.</p><p></p><p>Li Fansi's divine sense instantly focused on Yan Fangzhou.</p><p></p><p>Trapped in an enhanced version of the Taiji Dust Array, no matter how he struggled, he faced only endless repetition and boring scenes. He couldn't escape.</p><p></p><p>With the inner and outer separation of spiritual energy in the formation, he couldn't cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Even when he tried to calm his mind, he couldn't. Every critical moment, the formation would precisely disturb him, causing him to feel restless and entangled.</p><p></p><p>Under this torment, Yan Fangzhou was on the verge of going insane.</p><p></p><p>He launched indiscriminate attacks on his surroundings, venting his frustration.</p><p></p><p>But his anger was impotent.</p><p></p><p>Not only could he not change the situation, but he also made his state worse.</p><p></p><p>By the time Yan Fangzhou came back to his senses, he had exhausted all his strength.</p><p></p><p>Like an ordinary person, he was now helplessly imprisoned in the array.</p><p></p><p>Helpless and awaiting death.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing stages of raging, crying, looking lifeless, Yan Fangzhou, the "arrogant talent," now seemed completely devoid of spirit, sitting limp and motionless on the ground.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fansi didn't appear to mock him but carefully observed Yan Fangzhou.</p><p></p><p>Then, a slight smile appeared on his lips.</p><p></p><p>Although Yan Fangzhou's act was good, fooling the cunning Li Fansi completely was still a bit lacking.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, Yan Fangzhou had never seen what a real breakdown looked like.</p><p></p><p>Deep within his hollow eyes, there was still a trace of intelligence.</p><p></p><p>"This is pretending to be crazy; trying to deceive me and attacking me again when I lower my guard."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, he may fool the naive Shang Tianci, but not me."</p><p></p><p>Li Fansi shook his head slightly. "He still has these little tricks, showing that he has not truly reached the point of breaking down."</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait until he truly goes crazy."</p><p></p><p>With a light touch on Yan Fangzhou, who stood motionless in front of the black gate, Li Fansi reinforced the formation once again.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he leave satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Unaware of the fact that he had cleverly undone his own cleverness, Yan Fangzhou continued to play the fool in the array, waiting for someone to come.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After resolving this small incident, Li Fansi came to the faceless statue.</p><p></p><p>Since he intended to win the trust of Morubin, the Law King of the Xuantian School, Li Fansi naturally had to play his role well.</p><p></p><p>The action of recruiting soldiers and buying horses could not be halted.</p><p></p><p>As he approached the statue, various scenes inexplicably appeared in his mind.</p>

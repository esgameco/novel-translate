        <h1>Chapter 880</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"If that's the case, even without this so-called miraculous medicine, can we endure it just relying on ourselves?" </p><p></p><p>Compared to Kou Hong, Dao Xuanzi appeared much calmer, though still tightly clenched his fists and had an unpleasant expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder during this period, I've been feeling a bit mentally confused from time to time. Wanting to do something, but feeling lost and confused. It turns out it's all because of this Heart Ascension Pill!" Kou Hong gritted his teeth, realizing.</p><p></p><p>"Yet, my brother and I were grateful and eagerly joined the Wanxian Alliance overnight..."</p><p></p><p>Feeling deceived and greatly insulted, Kou Hong stood up explosively.</p><p></p><p>"No, the more I think about it, the angrier I get."</p><p></p><p>"I can't stay in this Wanxian Alliance anymore!"</p><p></p><p>Hot-headed Kou Hong made a decision right away.</p><p></p><p>"Just wait!" Ji Shaoli reached out to stop him.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I know you're upset, Kou brother. But..."</p><p></p><p>"Have you thought about the consequences of leaving the Wanxian Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli spoke meaningfully, "I've never heard of anyone who left the Wanxian Alliance and lived well afterwards."</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong raised his eyebrows, angrily saying, "So what? I, Kou Hong, am not someone who fears death."</p><p></p><p>"At worst, I will expose the secret of this miraculous medicine! Destroy them all!"</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, I will never stay in this Wanxian Alliance again! It makes me sick!"</p><p></p><p>Dao Xuanzi also stood up, apparently making the same decision as Kou Hong.</p><p></p><p>"You both are true heroes, true men!"</p><p></p><p>"I haven't misjudged!" Ji Shaoli praised and clapped.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean by this, Dao friend?" Dao Xuanzi asked with a glint in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I also think the Alliance is unrighteous. We cultivators should unite to overthrow it and bring a bright future to the cultivation world!" Ji Shaoli's expression turned serious.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi were shocked, exchanged glances, and quickly became more courteous to Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>But they just had issues with the Wanxian Alliance, they weren't foolish.</p><p></p><p>They were only at the Golden Core stage, while the Wanxian Alliance had many Nascent Soul and Dao Integration experts...</p><p></p><p>Overthrow the Wanxian Alliance?</p><p></p><p>What a joke.</p><p></p><p>The two pretended not to have heard Ji Shaoli's words and prepared to bid farewell and leave.</p><p></p><p>However, Ji Shaoli would not let them leave so easily.</p><p></p><p>In that small secret room, he forcefully informed them of the existence of the Universal Union Association. The means used for it need not be elaborated on.</p><p></p><p>After a brief conversation, Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi changed from being hesitant to eager, where they previously wanted to avoid it at all costs.</p><p></p><p>"The most robust fortress is often breached from within."</p><p></p><p>"Our Mutual Help Association is a nail into the heart of the Alliance! Hidden and silent, until one day when the time is ripe, we will bury the Wanxian Alliance completely!" Ji Shaoli stated firmly.</p><p></p><p>"How do you both feel about this?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ji Shaoli's enthusiastic gaze, Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi still hesitated.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that this was different from when they were wandering cultivators, this time it felt like a matter of life and death!</p><p></p><p>However, at this point, having learned the secret of the Universal Union Association, if they didn't agree, they might not be able to safely leave the room today.</p><p></p><p>As the two brothers hesitated, Ji Shaoli increased the stakes.</p><p></p><p>"Do you two know why our Mutual Help Association, just established a few years ago, can attract numerous cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>"Besides the so-called mutual aid, resource sharing, the fundamental reason is that the Universal Union Association selects core forces and nurtures them."</p><p></p><p>"All cultivation resources are made readily available."</p><p></p><p>"For example..."</p><p></p><p>"Yuanying Immortal Realms, Nascent Soul transformations, and even the essence of Heaven and Earth!"</p><p></p><p>Although Ji Shaoli spoke lightly, to Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi, it was like a thunderbolt striking their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong couldn't help but swallow hard, "Friend Ji, is this true?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli smiled slightly and confirmed.</p><p></p><p>"Both of you were wandering cultivators before, and surely know the difficulties of cultivation. Not to mention the essence of Heaven and Earth or the transformations in cultivation. Just speaking of this Yuanying Immortal Realm, do you have the confidence to find it on your own?"</p><p></p><p>"If ascending to the Yuanying stage seems impossible, are you willing to let your cultivation be stuck at the Golden Core realm for the rest of your life?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's voice grew louder, resonating in the minds of Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi.</p><p></p><p>"A man is born between Heaven and Earth; how can he live insignificantly all his life!" Kou Hong spoke determinedly.</p><p></p><p>"Such a heaven-sent opportunity must not be missed," Dao Xuanzi also said with a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Very good! Then let us conduct the membership ceremony again. A real membership ceremony." Ji Shaoli laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the mysterious and inscrutable faceless stone statue appeared again above the secret room.</p><p></p><p>Under Ji Shaoli's guidance, Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi recited the oath once again.</p><p></p><p>With some changes to the content, after the recital, they felt as if their minds were invisibly shackled.</p><p></p><p>The two brothers exchanged a glance, secretly feeling shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Now that we are family, there are some things I will say directly." Ji Shaoli kindly pulled the two to sit at the stone table in the secret room.</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, the peculiar items you two have for foundation building are the Dao Xuan Sword and the Qiu Long Branch, right?" Ji Shaoli asked.</p><p></p><p>How could he have seen that?</p><p></p><p>The two brothers were shocked and about to stand up at once.</p><p></p><p>Signaling them not to be surprised, Ji Shaoli continued candidly, "I see that you two possess extraordinary talents. However, you have been hindered by the quality of these peculiar foundation-building items."</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention extraordinary items of heaven and earth, even if you change them to top-quality items, the future possibilities will be limitless."</p><p></p><p>Even though the two brothers were very confident, they couldn't resist Ji Shaoli's praise.</p><p></p><p>Their faces reddened, ready to speak humbly.</p><p></p><p>However, Ji Shaoli's next words immediately caught their attention.</p><p></p><p>"Our Mutual Help Association selects core personnel based not on qualifications or talents but on character!"</p><p></p><p>"As long as the character meets the requirements, we will help them..."</p><p></p><p>"Defy fate!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Hong's breath hitched, "Defy fate? But we have..."</p><p></p><p>"That's right. Have you heard of the 'Re-Establish Dao' method?" Ji Shaoli said enticingly.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Re-Establish Dao' method allows a cultivator, after establishing a new Tao foundation, to not only have no impact on their cultivation and magical powers. It also slowly devours the original Tao foundation with the new one, quietly completing a transformation, fully rectifying past flaws..."</p><p></p><p>As Ji Shaoli explained, Kou Hong and Dao Xuanzi's breathing became more rapid.</p><p></p><p>"Such a heaven-defying method exists in this world?"</p>

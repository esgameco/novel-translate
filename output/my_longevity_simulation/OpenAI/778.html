        <h1>Chapter 778</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"However, speaking of it again, if one truly desires nothing..."</p><p></p><p>"Then there would be no more demands from 'Huanzhen' as well."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly and pushed aside this unrealistic idea.</p><p></p><p>Using his index finger, he fixed the dissociation plate in mid-air. Then, Li Fan took out eight white flashing crystals from his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>"At the critical moment, if I want to attract the attention of the Tianxuan Mirror by infusing formations into the dissociation plate, there surely won't be enough time for me to do it slowly. I need to make preparations in advance."</p><p></p><p>Thinking so, Li Fan narrowed his eyes and began injecting the information of the 'Reversal of Life and Death Formation' into these eight flashing crystals separately.</p><p></p><p>These crystals were similar to Formation Crowns and were called Formation Crystals. They could record and store formations, but unlike Formation Crowns that could be reused multiple times, Formation Crystals were for one-time use only.</p><p></p><p>Each Formation Crystal was engraved with a part of the formation. Li Fan manipulated them to hover around the dissociation plate.</p><p></p><p>"With just a single thought from me, these Formation Crystals will burst simultaneously, infusing the formation information into the dissociation plate."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the eight white crystals flashing irregularly and set up another formation to restrain them, preventing any accidents.</p><p></p><p>Next came the 'Tianxuan Sealing Spirit Formation'.</p><p></p><p>After completing these repetitive actions, the dissociation plate, enveloped in sixteen flashing crystals at its center, was no longer visible.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully stored it in a blank storage ring.</p><p></p><p>"I still can't be sure if the Tianxuan Secondary Body is still connected to the Tianxuan Mirror. This is just a backup plan."</p><p></p><p>"I must be fully prepared and give it my all."</p><p></p><p>Exiting the secret room, Li Fan first arrived at the Qianli Hall in Tianquan City.</p><p></p><p>The place was deserted, with even the signboard hanging crookedly, and Jiao Xiuyuan had not come out to manage it.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that Qianli Hall's business has declined drastically, and it seems to be true." Li Fan thought to himself and strode in.</p><p></p><p>The gradual popularity of the Tianxuan Mirror had enabled cultivators to trade freely even across several states, with almost no restrictions on transactions anytime, anywhere. Due to the public availability of various information, the prices of all goods were almost transparent.</p><p></p><p>This was a significant blow to businessmen like Jiao Xiuyuan. Almost overnight, countless shops disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Jiao Xiuyuan's business was also for cultivation purposes. As long as it didn't incur losses, it wasn't a big problem. Making a real profit wasn't a matter of life and death for him.</p><p></p><p>But obviously, suddenly losing the basis for cultivation was not easy for Jiao Xiuyuan.</p><p></p><p>"What should I do..."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan lay listlessly behind the dusty wooden counter, muttering to himself.</p><p></p><p>Lost in his thoughts, he didn't even notice someone walking in.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan lightly knocked.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan jumped up, startled. "A client has come?"</p><p></p><p>He looked at Li Fan suspiciously, still somewhat incredulous.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan slowly examined Jiao Xiuyuan's puppet-like body, giving him a creepy feeling.</p><p></p><p>"You..." Jiao Xiuyuan seemed perplexed.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Jiao, I wonder if you'd be interested in selling this puppet body. The price is negotiable!" Li Fan smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan's expression changed, and he was about to speak vehemently but suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>He stared at what Li Fan had quietly taken out of his hand.</p><p></p><p>"What's this..." Being well-versed in various items, Jiao Xiuyuan almost instantly recognized the similar aura to the Tianxuan Mirror on it.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianxuan Secondary Body?" Jiao Xiuyuan was shocked.</p><p></p><p>There were no more than fifty Tianxuan Secondary Bodies in the entire Xuanhuang Realm, each with unique functions and were basically priceless. Cultivators never sold them.</p><p></p><p>Having various data of different Tianxuan Secondary Bodies flash through his mind, Jiao Xiuyuan couldn’t match any of them with the item in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan was intrigued and closed the shop door, enthusiastically inviting Li Fan in.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, tell me! It's just a puppet body, not a problem."</p><p></p><p>"But I wonder, what exactly is this in your hand..." Jiao Xiuyuan lowered his voice, trying to ask.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan answered cheerfully, "Tianxuan Secondary Body, Terminal Disk."</p><p></p><p>"It can block the perception of the Tianxuan Mirror and Tianxuan Mirror Treasure."</p><p></p><p>At the first sentence from Li Fan, Jiao Xiuyuan’s eyes lit up. But when Li Fan said the second sentence, he shuddered.</p><p></p><p>Subconsciously looking around, he wiped the cold sweat from his forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Is that true?"</p><p></p><p>With a hint of greed in his eyes, Jiao Xiuyuan wanted to reach out.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, Li Fan didn't stop him from touching such a treasure but allowed him to pick up the Terminal Disk.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Jiao Xiuyuan was puzzled, closely examining the white jade-like disk.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, his face showed a look of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Clutching it tightly, he looked up at Li Fan with an inscrutable expression.</p><p></p><p>"Friend..." Jiao Xiuyuan began.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan interrupted him, "Friend Jiao, how much do you think this item is worth?"</p><p></p><p>"Incalculable! The stronger the Tianxuan Mirror, the more urgent the need for this item among cultivators, and thus the higher its value!" Jiao Xiuyuan exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, what price are you looking for?" Jiao Xiuyuan naturally didn't think Li Fan would bring out such a precious item just for his puppet body and quickly asked.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he had already thought out his way of survival for the future.</p><p></p><p>That was to specialize in high-quality, monopolized goods.</p><p></p><p>"You said the information on goods is public, right? If I'm the only one with something in the entire world, don't I still get to set the price?"</p><p></p><p>With his shops spread everywhere and unparalleled promotional skills, if each high-quality item were auctioned...</p><p></p><p>While the scale of business might decrease, profits would likely not be affected and might even increase further.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan was filled with thoughts of the future.</p><p></p><p>Yet, with just a few words from Li Fan, he was brought back to reality.</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't I clear enough? Friend, it's just your puppet body."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's indifferent words left Jiao Xiuyuan somewhat dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Since he harbored doubts, he thought, "Could it be that I misjudged? Is this actually a counterfeit?" Jiao Xiuyuan quietly observed the Terminal Disk in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Jiao, you don't need to doubt. There's absolutely no issue with the effectiveness of this item."</p><p></p><p>"So, my request may be a bit unusual." Li Fan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Xiuyuan's expression changed erratically.</p><p></p><p>But as Li Fan continued to speak softly, he became somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>He nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>The two conversed for a long time in the Qianli Hall.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, Li Fan left quietly without taking back the Terminal Disk, and he also left the puppet body behind.</p>

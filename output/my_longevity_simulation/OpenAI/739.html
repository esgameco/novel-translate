        <h1>Chapter 739</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Since he had specifically instructed before leaving, one should also follow through as his subordinate.</p><p></p><p>Moreover...</p><p></p><p>Over the years, the countless disappearances of cultivators by the Infinite Wall, strictly speaking, were also related to his supervisor, Li Fan. After all, before becoming the Lord of Tianliang City, Nangong Shirong served as the commander of the Tianliang Prefecture Garrison. Such a major event within his jurisdiction, and yet he had never noticed...</p><p></p><p>If accused, a dereliction of duty would be inevitable. Nangong Shirong had recently become the city lord and his foundation was not yet stable. Back then, by stepping on Xiang Rongxin to rise, he had offended many people. If a mistake was made and a vulnerability exposed, leading to a public backlash, the position of this lord might not be secure, and he may be ousted before settling in.</p><p></p><p>As his confidant, Xu Bai naturally had to share the burden for the lord.</p><p></p><p>He secretly backed up the data on the disappearances over the years, and then went to the Ministry of Administration to greet Guan Xingxiu, who came to investigate.</p><p></p><p>Unlike his lazy appearance in the previous life in Lanlin Prefecture, at this moment, Guan Xingxiu was like a drawn sword, exuding his sharpness unrestrainedly.</p><p></p><p>"Respects to Senior Guan..." Xu Bai greeted respectfully. Subsequently, Xu Bai reported, "I have found a lead on Chang Ge's whereabouts. I believe I can provide an answer soon."</p><p></p><p>"Your efficiency is so low that if you were in Tianyu Prefecture, you would have been dismissed and investigated long ago," Guan Xingxiu coldly snorted.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai did not respond.</p><p></p><p>"I'll give you another seven days. If by then, there's still no definite result..." a golden flying sword suddenly flew out, hovering above the Ministry of Administration.</p><p></p><p>"Don't blame me for not showing mercy!" Guan Xingxiu's tone was stern as his figure gradually disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Only the golden sword remained, emanating a strong killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"The Falling Star Divine Sword..."</p><p></p><p>The nearly tangible killing intent made Xu Bai's skin tingle, forcing him to step back. He looked up at the golden flying sword above his head and seemed to see a scene of stars falling as a sword soared through the sky.</p><p></p><p>He was not unfamiliar with this sword.</p><p></p><p>In the previous life, when he accompanied Huangfu Song to popularize the construction of the Tianxuan Lock Spirit Array in Lanlin Prefecture, Guan Xingxiu had used this same Falling Star Divine Sword to suppress the local cultivators who resisted. Although Guan Xingxiu had fallen to the Nascent Divinity realm at that time, relying on this golden flying sword, he had a smooth journey, even making Daoist cultivators have to yield to him.</p><p></p><p>This fully demonstrated the extraordinariness of the Falling Star Divine Sword.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Bai did not show any anger but observed it seriously.</p><p></p><p>"This sword is not under the elders of the Heaven Sword Sect. No wonder Chang Ge admires it," he thought while deeply immersed in the sharp and determined aura emanating from it.</p><p></p><p>After some time, a voice filled with anger and caution from Nangong Shirong startled Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>"The old man is going too far. If I could defeat him..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai pretended not to hear the latter part and greeted, "Welcome back, my lord."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Lao Guan is in such a hurry. The moment Chang Ge had an incident, he quickly came to investigate. It turns out that this Chang Ge is Lao Guan's former lover's son," Nangong Shirong waved his hand, indicating Xu Bai need not be overly courteous. Then he sat down with some schadenfreude.</p><p></p><p>"So, Chang Ge is Guan Xingxiu's illegitimate son?" Xu Bai was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>But Nangong Shirong's next words caught him off guard: "No. There is no actual blood relationship between them. It's just a clich√©, an unrequited love story. Lao Guan seems heartless on the surface but privately, he's a sentimental person. Even though his former lover is now married, he still holds her close to his heart. He even cares for and looks after her son as if he were his own."</p><p></p><p>"If it wasn't for this visit to Master Ji Cheng, I wouldn't have known about this matter," Nangong Shirong said with a smile that wasn't quite a smile.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai listened silently, showing no unusual expression. The bantering between the Dao Lord's was not something a mere Nascent Infant like him could participate in.</p><p></p><p>"Guan Xingxiu is going out of control, and even with Master Ji Cheng's face, he might not yield. We should hurry and send him away. How is the investigation going on Chang Ge's disappearance?" After muttering to himself for a while, Nangong Shirong finally asked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai then detailed the findings of the disappearances of cultivators that had occurred over the years in Tianliang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"Infinite Wall?" Nangong Shirong seemed to recall something and a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Besides you, who else is aware of this matter?" He quickly followed up.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't mentioned it to anyone, always waiting for your return, my lord," Xu Bai replied firmly.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Shirong was very pleased: "Very well. Consider the previous disappearances as if they never happened. It's just an isolated incidence! We can't let others draw unfounded conclusions!"</p><p></p><p>"Next, you will accompany me to the Infinite Wall to see if we can rescue Chang Ge. Follow me!" Nangong Shirong ordered.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>Without gathering too many people, Nangong Shirong arrived at the foot of the Infinite Mountain with Xu Bai and three other Nascent Infant core cultivators.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there were no visible images on the smooth mountainside. They didn't approach closely but watched from afar.</p><p></p><p>"I have been to the Infinite Wall when I was a Nascent Infant cultivator. Back then, I had quite an experience," Nangong Shirong said with a nostalgic look in his eyes after seemingly sinking into old memories for a while.</p><p></p><p>The other three Nascent Infant cultivators remained silent. Only Xu Bai, with a hint of astonishment in his tone, asked, "Could it be that my lord, you have also witnessed strange occurrences on this Infinite Wall?"</p><p></p><p>Nangong Shirong chuckled, "Not witnessed, but I was also once trapped within this Infinite Wall."</p><p></p><p>"However, I quickly broke free at that time, so I dismissed it as an illusion occurring during enlightenment. Over the years, I have never heard of anyone else experiencing something similar, so I slowly forgot about it."</p><p></p><p>()</p>

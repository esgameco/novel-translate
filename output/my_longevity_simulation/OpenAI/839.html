        <h1>Chapter 839</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>But they could still feel the huge roar and vibration coming from the surging flow of Earth's veins.</p><p></p><p>It was like a huge wave hitting them from behind. Even the forest spirits protected by the power of the ancient trees of the Earth's veins were forced to sway and directly deviate from their original path.</p><p></p><p>It is imaginable how terrifying the situation in Qiling Prefecture must be.</p><p></p><p>Not only the neighboring prefectures, but even the distant Congyun Sea area.</p><p></p><p>Could feel a slight vibration.</p><p></p><p>On Haixuan Island.</p><p></p><p>There was already an altruistic association of eighteen cultivators in the Congyun Sea, who were originally enthusiastically discussing the organization's future planning.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everything fell silent in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at each other, shocked and uncertain.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Just now, it shouldn't have been my imagination, right?" He Zhenghao asked with some uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>He DaoYou was truly a shrewd talent who knew the times.</p><p></p><p>Although he missed the opportunity of joining the association for the first time. But after confirming the news of Pei Tuo's successful advancement to the Yuan Ying stage, he immediately visited Ji Shaoli again.</p><p></p><p>Even after being rejected at the door for seven days, he did not give up.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he persistently sent messages, expressing his strong desire to join the association.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Ji Shaoli was moved by his sincerity.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao thus became one of the eleven cultivators who joined the Congyun Sea mutual aid association in the second batch.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli remained silent. Many other cultivators, including Pei Tuo who had the highest cultivation level, were looking in the direction of Qiling Prefecture with a solemn expression: "It's not an illusion. Even here, we can feel the slight tremor of the earth. It seems like something big is happening."</p><p></p><p>"How terrifying. I wonder how many cultivators will perish in this disaster."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the conflict is reigniting?"</p><p></p><p>…</p><p></p><p>Discussions ensued among the group.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Ji Shaoli, who was always attentive to the movements of the Immortal Alliance, immediately read out the official announcement.</p><p></p><p>"An earthquake occurred in Qiling Prefecture, and some cultivators rushed to the scene."</p><p></p><p>"The earthquake has gradually subsided, and there have been no reports of cultivators falling."</p><p></p><p>"After preliminary investigation, the possibility of further disasters has been ruled out."</p><p></p><p>"No need to panic…"</p><p></p><p>After Ji Shaoli finished reading, he looked at the people in the room and asked, "What do you all think?"</p><p></p><p>Xiang Xin coldly snorted, "Such a big disaster, claiming that no cultivators died. Who would believe that?"</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators immediately echoed, "Right. In my opinion, the Immortal Alliance is deliberately covering up the situation."</p><p></p><p>"They are becoming more and more audacious. Can't even be bothered to come up with a proper cover-up anymore?"</p><p></p><p>…</p><p></p><p>The reactions of the people were within Ji Shaoli's expectations.</p><p></p><p>If not for the fact that either the higher-ups or someone orchestrating the earthquake in Qiling Prefecture, he himself would also find it hard to believe that in such a horrific disaster, there would be no casualties among the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not step forward to correct them.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli smiled faintly and said, "Alright, let's stop the discussion here. It's fine to speak among ourselves, but it's better to keep it to ourselves when outside. Otherwise, it might attract unnecessary trouble."</p><p></p><p>No one present was inexperienced. They all nodded immediately.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli then redirected the conversation back to the main topic.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that I don't trust you all. It's just that this matter is of great importance. If there's any leakage, all of you here will probably not escape death."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, I need all of you to make an oath in front of the 'Saviors of the Suffering and Compassionate Immortals' emblem."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli placed a red, eerie-looking covenant in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>Pei Tuo didn't hesitate and was the first to make the oath, inscribing his name on the covenant.</p><p></p><p>The others followed suit one after another.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli nodded with satisfaction and put away the red covenant.</p><p></p><p>He asked, "What do you think about the upcoming Immortal Alliance examination?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was momentarily stunned, unsure of Ji Shaoli's intentions.</p><p></p><p>Because everyone present was already working within the Immortal Alliance system.</p><p></p><p>Although the upcoming examination is grand and has expanded by half the positions, it was not within their reach.</p><p></p><p>Unless...</p><p></p><p>Such incidents had happened before.</p><p></p><p>Only those who were extremely dissatisfied with their current positions and had no hope of promotion for a long time would consider such action.</p><p></p><p>After all, the examination was not easy, and who could guarantee that after resigning from their current position, they could smoothly re-enter?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this would offend their immediate superiors.</p><p></p><p>If they couldn't re-enter successfully, they might have to consider leaving their homeland for safety.</p><p></p><p>Without absolute confidence, hardly anyone would choose such a drastic measure.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the silence on the faces of everyone in the room, Ji Shaoli did not explain immediately.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he distributed jade slips to each person.</p><p></p><p>After examining the contents, the frowns of everyone deepened.</p><p></p><p>They could naturally see that the contents in the jade slips were the format of the examination questions.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to Ji Shaoli's previous mysterious actions.</p><p></p><p>And the terrifying background hidden by the mutual aid association.</p><p></p><p>A guess emerged in everyone's minds.</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible?"</p><p></p><p>Soon, they all shook their heads secretly, denying the idea.</p><p></p><p>The examination questions for joining the Immortal Alliance were among the most guarded secrets.</p><p></p><p>Although they occasionally grumbled about the decadence of the Immortal Alliance, they had never heard of the examination questions being leaked in all these years.</p><p></p><p>Although there was undoubtedly strong support behind the mutual aid association.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>The scene fell into silence for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then Ji Shaoli spoke, confirming the guess that they dared not even think about.</p><p></p><p>"If nothing unexpected happens, the contents of this year's examination questions should be in these jade slips."</p><p></p><p>His words were light.</p><p></p><p>But to the listeners, it was like a thunderbolt.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators stood up immediately, staring at Ji Shaoli in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Ji, is this true?"</p><p></p><p>"When have I ever lied to you all?" Ji Shaoli cut in decisively.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, giving everyone time to accept the huge shock, Ji Shaoli looked at He Zhenghao and the others with varied expressions and spoke again, "Although with the support of the organization, everyone's strength will undoubtedly advance rapidly in a short time. But it may still be difficult to get promoted. After all, those willing to join our mutual aid association might not have any strong backgrounds."</p><p></p><p>"And, the Congyun Sea is a remote place. It can't be compared to the bustling regions at the center of the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>After explaining the reason for helping everyone, Ji Shaoli asked, "The real examination questions are here. I wonder which of you would be willing to take the leap?"</p><p></p><p>With these words, the room fell into a deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>From the expressions on everyone's faces, their inner struggles were evident.</p>

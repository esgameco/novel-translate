        <div class="content">
            <p>Just as Su Yuqing finished praying and was cultivating by the Immortal Spirit Tower, her face suddenly turned rosy.</p><p></p><p>It felt as if her body was abruptly forced open by a massive object, letting out a sound of painful groaning.</p><p></p><p>Just as she felt bewildered and at a loss, the pure spiritual energy that mysteriously descended into her body seemed to dissolve like melting glaciers, bursting open with a bang!</p><p></p><p>Whistling through her body, after just a few cycles, it transformed into a power she could control.</p><p></p><p>It gently returned to her dantian!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, her realm was rapidly ascending at a terrifying speed, visible to the naked eye.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, she skyrocketed from the early stage of Golden Elixir to the consummation stage.</p><p></p><p>Because the breakthrough required materials from Dongtian, she reluctantly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Throughout this process, the bottleneck that limited cultivators, known as the "Curse of the Heavens," did not appear!</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing felt dazed as she sensed her realm cultivation, her face full of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Carefully pondering the source of this power that helped her break through, Su Yuqing then seemed to realize something, her expression changing.</p><p></p><p>Quickly kneeling down, she began to meditate and express gratitude for the gift from the "Compassionate Immortal of the Mortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Spirit Wood Realm, in front of the faceless statue of the god.</p><p></p><p>An invisible feedback of cultivation suddenly appeared inside Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>It originated from the Sit-In Method, brought by Su Yuqing's consecutive breakthroughs!</p><p></p><p>Subtracting what Li Fan had given to Su Yuqing previously, even after the exchange, Li Fan's cultivation slightly improved!</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was shocked inexplicably. </p><p></p><p>However, he soon calmed down.</p><p></p><p>The generation of cultivation feedback did not actually defy logic; it still fell within the operational mechanism of the Sit-In Method.</p><p></p><p>Just like how Li Fan, if willing to personally consume his cultivation to help others advance their realm.</p><p></p><p>Once the task was completed, he indeed could receive a certain amount of cultivation feedback.</p><p></p><p>However, the cultivation loss generated in this process was too massive. It was genuinely a losing deal.</p><p></p><p>"Now, through this faceless statue, the loss in cultivation transfer has been significantly reduced."</p><p></p><p>"Which unexpectedly makes this behavior advantageous!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan instantly understood that this was an additional function brought by this mysterious faceless stone statue.</p><p></p><p>"Communication with believers, bestowal of divine gifts..."</p><p></p><p>"It's becoming more and more like a trickster."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted his eyes, his gaze once again falling on the faceless statue.</p><p></p><p>"Now the question arises, if there is indeed a powerful figure behind this stone statue."</p><p></p><p>"Why doesn't he directly contact these 'believers,' instead of transferring all these abilities and reactions to me?"</p><p></p><p>"Is my secret about to be exposed?"</p><p></p><p>After much contemplation, Li Fan's conclusion leaned towards no.</p><p></p><p>After all, according to the temperaments of those strong individuals, if they were aware of the existence of "Hanzhen" within him, it was almost impossible for them to continue playing cat and mouse games with him.</p><p></p><p>Most likely, they would directly descend and seize.</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps, she entered into slumber due to some reason."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze flickered.</p><p></p><p>After staring at the statue for a long time, he eventually walked away calmly.</p><p></p><p>Rather than issuing an order forbidding anyone from approaching the faceless statue, everything remained as usual, as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>Upon getting further away from the statue, the prayers in Li Fan's mind gradually disappeared.</p><p></p><p>This further solidified Li Fan's judgment.</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Heaven Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan urgently wanted to know more about this ancient mysterious sect.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the present thousands of years later, even during the era of the Ten Immortal Sects of the ancient Dao, the Mysterious Heaven Sect was an absolute taboo topic.</p><p></p><p>Only the true cores of various sects were qualified to know.</p><p></p><p>Even after experiencing multiple reincarnations, Li Fan only caught a glimpse of the Mysterious Heaven Sect from Zhao Shijie's dream.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, there is still a way."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Fan remembered the first instance in the Fallen Immortal Realmâ€”the "Ningyuan Life Fruit."</p><p></p><p>"If I wait passively, will I be able to encounter this Lama in the Fallen Immortal Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but feel an excitement surging within him.</p><p></p><p>Because only a strand of divine consciousness went to the Fallen Immortal Realm, even if harmonized by this Lama, it posed no harm to his essence.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, this is a rare opportunity difficult to achieve in reality."</p><p></p><p>"While gazing into the abyss, the abyss gazes also upon you. When he tries to seize Li Chen's body, merging with Li Fan, Li Chen is also trying to pry into his memories."</p><p></p><p>As for whether the Lama in the Fallen Immortal Realm could cross the boundary between the Fallen Immortal Realm and reality to affect and harm Li Fan...</p><p></p><p>It was simply impossible unless his strength surpassed that Fallen Immortal!</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan's eyes flickered, he pondered and found the idea feasible.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>His figure flickered, arriving in the sealed secret chamber of the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>He skillfully set up the ceremony.</p><p></p><p>"Previously, it was due to fear of Mr. Bai that I thought not to enter the Fallen Immortal Realm until finding a way to completely resolve the hidden dangers of 'Hanzhen.'"</p><p></p><p>"But now, the crisis brought by the Mysterious Heaven Sect seems more imminent."</p><p></p><p>"As for the risk..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes showed no fear, resolute and steadfast: "Fear at the beginning and end leads to not accomplishing great things! Am I, Li Fan, someone who behaves so crudely!"</p><p></p><p>"Blessings to you, Xuanhuang Heavenly Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>Silently reciting in his heart, the surroundings abruptly distorted the next moment.</p><p></p><p>Predictably, he returned to the "Ningyuan Life Fruit" instance within the Fallen Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother? Junior Brother?"</p><p></p><p>The familiar voice of Zhang Qianmo came into Li Fan's ears.</p><p></p><p>With the strange feeling receding like a tide, Li Fan turned to look at Zhang Qianmo.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, what's wrong with you?" Zhang Qianmo's eyes held some doubt and concern.</p><p></p><p>"Just feeling a bit excited for the first time coming down the mountain."</p><p></p><p>As they chatted, they arrived in Ningyuan City.</p><p></p><p>Following the set trajectory, Senior Brother Zhang couldn't wait to see his old flame, Red Glow, leaving the task of collecting Life Fruits to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled and didn't stop him.</p><p></p><p>After they parted ways, Li Fan didn't do anything out of the ordinary and went directly to the central part of the city to collect three Life Fruits from the "Reincarnating Longevity Tree."</p><p></p><p>Under the guidance of Song Hesong, the city's manager, Li Fan quickly extracted the Life Fruits from the seal.</p><p></p><p>According to the "plot," soon, the ambush of the Wuxian Alliance cultivators, including Chu Liang, hiding in the city, would aim to provoke Senior Brother Zhang's old flame Red Glow and then attack her. Ultimately, they would be counterattacked.</p><p></p><p>Looking back at Song Hesong, Li Fan's face revealed a slight eerie smile.</p><p></p><p>Song Hesong's heart pounded violently, a vague sense of foreboding rising within him.</p><p></p><p>"Whoof!"</p><p></p><p>Without warning, Li Fan violently spat out a mouthful of blood, his face as pale as paper.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, save me!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shouted urgently.</p>

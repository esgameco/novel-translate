        <h1>Chapter 929</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>These sentences are spoken as if by different people, with different tones and inflections. The echoes reverberate in the main hall of the sect, lingering for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The already strange scene became even more eerie with the backdrop.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing, however, showed no fear at all, saying, "If the Celestial Lord dares to give, I dare to take."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Senior Sister's laughter abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing instantly felt as if there were thousands of eyes looking at him from different directions in the main hall.</p><p></p><p>"Remnants of the Mysterious Sky School..."</p><p></p><p>"Even if I give it to you, so what? Can you walk out of my Great Dao Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Only a chilly voice remained to question.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing smiled faintly, "If you don't try, how would you know?"</p><p></p><p>The provocation in this sentence was too strong. Even though Li Qing's behavior in the illusion was unique, at this moment, it seemed like he genuinely angered the Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>Around Li Qing, in the once empty main hall, countless faces suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>The expressions on the faces were varied, but all were staring at Li Qing intensely.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, from beneath the faces, out of the void darkness, white arms emerged out of thin air and reached towards Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Li Qing was engulfed by this tide-like surge of pale limbs.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like he was about to disappear in this hall soon.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>After a moment, numerous sharp voices suddenly erupted from these faces in unison.</p><p></p><p>The voices carried fear, dread, resentment...</p><p></p><p>As if there was something extremely terrifying about Li Qing, they all, without exception, scattered much faster than when trying to devour him, quickly dispersing!</p><p></p><p>In the center of the main hall, a girl in her early teens, Zhao Senior Sister, for the first time, showed a slight emotional fluctuation on her calm face.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>Several stone pillars appeared out of nowhere above Li Qing, thunderously falling down to form a cage, trapping him inside.</p><p></p><p>"What's on you..."</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Lord's cold voice even carried a hint of dread.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing countered with a smile, "I still wanted to consult the Celestial Lord. Do you have any clues about this object?"</p><p></p><p>The main hall fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then the voice of the Celestial Lord sounded again, "I had doubts before about whether you were from the Mysterious Sky School, but now I am starting to believe it."</p><p></p><p>"Daring to keep such a thing within your soul..."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, we can't merge again."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing just smiled and did not respond.</p><p></p><p>He was simply sensing the flickering seven-colored light ball in his soul.</p><p></p><p>Since he had consciousness, this thing had been suppressed deep within his soul.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, it was implanted by the Origin when creating the avatar.</p><p></p><p>The seven-colored light ball was not important; what was crucial was what was sealed within it.</p><p></p><p>Despite the barrier of the seven-colored divine light, Li Qing constantly felt a sense of imminent danger.</p><p></p><p>It could be imagined that whatever was sealed inside was extremely dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Although there was no memory in Li Qing's mind about this object, he knew that the reason the Origin dared to let him, at the Nascent Soul Realm, navigate the Great Dao Sect alone was based on the intimidation from this object!</p><p></p><p>Even though there was such a fierce thing hidden in his soul, Li Qing remained fearless.</p><p></p><p>With a fleeting thought, he looked at the young Zhao Senior Sister sitting in front of him and said solemnly, "Now that the Celestial Lord has attained the position of eternal life, those methods are useless to the Celestial Lord."</p><p></p><p>"But for our Mysterious Sky School, they are vital. The Celestial Lord is not as good as receiving adult beauty. In the future, our Mysterious Sky School will definitely thank the Celestial Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the Celestial Lord remained silent, Li Qing hesitated for a moment before adding, "In fact, our Mysterious Sky School is also reasonable. If the Celestial Lord is willing to return the item to its rightful owner, we will provide corresponding compensation here."</p><p></p><p>"And, I believe that the Celestial Lord will definitely be interested in this thing."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing was confident in his words.</p><p></p><p>Quietly, the thousands of faces that were frightened off suddenly approached again.</p><p></p><p>"Compensation..."</p><p></p><p>Strange laughter burst from the faces.</p><p></p><p>"A thousand years since the Mysterious Sky School was destroyed, you people are all like rats who can't see the light."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words were spoken, they all froze.</p><p></p><p>They all stared at the sudden golden light appearing in the palm of Li Qing's hand, their expressions completely frozen!</p><p></p><p>In this Great Dao Sect, it was the cornerstone of his achievement of the realm of eternal life.</p><p></p><p>Although still within the Mysterious Yellow Realm, it could be seen as an independent realm completely under her control.</p><p></p><p>Any movements and changes in energy within the Great Dao Sect could not escape her control.</p><p></p><p>However, this sudden appearance of golden lightâ€¦</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Lord was certain that the source of the golden light was not from within Li Qing but from outside the Great Dao Sect!</p><p></p><p>It could ignore her restrictions and come and go freely...</p><p></p><p>Feeling the energy hidden in the golden light, ancient memories from the former elders of the Great Dao Sect emerged.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhao Senior Sister's reaction, Li Qing knew that the Origin's strategy had succeeded.</p><p></p><p>So he spoke loudly, "A temporary defeat does not mean a lifelong defeat. These years of lurking do not mean that we will disappear into the river of history."</p><p></p><p>"Even a centipede does not die but lives on. Let alone the legacy of a true immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing proudly declared.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Senior Sister, who had received several secret techniques of the Mysterious Sky School, naturally understood the terrible power of the Mysterious Sky School.</p><p></p><p>Just a few secret techniques had almost made her a Celestial Lord of eternal life.</p><p></p><p>The true heritage of the Mysterious Sky School was undoubtedly unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>More importantly...</p><p></p><p>Although the Mysterious Sky School was destroyed a thousand years ago, it was the joint effort of the ten sects of immortality.</p><p></p><p>But according to the secret records of the Great Dao Sect, the extermination of the school was extremely suspicious.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they had no intention of completely destroying the Mysterious Sky School in that battle, but unexpectedly, the opponent suddenly collapsed on their own.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the so-called half-step immortal King of the Mysterious Sky School did not appear on the battlefield that day.</p><p></p><p>That was why the battle went so smoothly.</p><p></p><p>The ten sects of immortality had also suspected whether there was a conspiracy in it.</p><p></p><p>Fearful that the Mysterious Sky King would rise again at any time, they issued a kill order for the remnants of the Mysterious Sky School.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to force out this hidden half-immortal.</p><p></p><p>However, he seemed to have vanished from the world, never to be seen in the Mysterious Yellow Realm again.</p><p></p><p>"Will the rebirth of the Mysterious Sky School from the ashes mean that the Mysterious Sky King will return as well?"</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Lord couldn't help but ponder this question.</p><p></p><p>After all, the grey mold and golden light of great power displayed by the Mysterious Sky School were obviously not powers that ordinary cultivators could possess.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Lord did not think for too long.</p><p></p><p>In her view, having one more variable in the Mysterious Yellow Realm was not a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>Although the realm of the half-immortal was powerful, the Mysterious Yellow Realm was also different from what it used to be.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the return of this half-immortal would bring changes and opportunities.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall, the faces of the thousands who were staring fearfully at Li Qing suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The dim hall also became bright.</p><p></p><p>"Nezha, I really like the gift you brought."</p>

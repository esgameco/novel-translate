        <h1>Chapter 945</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Just four days later, the holy fetus Li Fan returned to the space where Yanfa Jue was located.</p><p></p><p>Little Lolita who was working earnestly, seemed to sense something in her heart with the arrival of Li Fan, and suddenly raised her head.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the newcomer was indeed Li Fan, her big eyes flickered, thoughts stirring in her mind.</p><p></p><p>Little Lolita sat upright, looking serious.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan approached, clapping his hands on the table, he said in a childish voice, "Derive what kind of technique, what requirements for the technique, is it from scratch or based on an existing one."</p><p></p><p>"Write it down yourself."</p><p></p><p>Then a piece of white paper flew towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly forgetting the previous incident when Li Fan treated her illness, she was now solely focusing on deriving the technique.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan caught the paper, and the thought of how to write flowed quickly in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Deriving a technique resembling the technique based on the 'Record of the Three Perils of Ghosts and Gods'."</p><p></p><p>"Specific requirements: After practicing the technique, the emanated aura and characteristics should be identical to the 'Record of the Three Perils of Ghosts and Gods'. But the core is different, it needs to be a completely new technique..."</p><p></p><p>The densely packed little characters quickly filled the entire page.</p><p></p><p>However, the paper did not enlarge but instead, the font size shrunk in the entirety, revealing new blank areas.</p><p></p><p>This cycle repeated more than ten times, and still, the paper was not filled. [Incomplete text due to translation error.]</p><p></p><p>Though it was due to the complexity of the 'Record of the Three Perils of Ghosts and Gods' technique, this abnormal scene still alerted the guardians of the space.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan keenly sensed a divine consciousness sweep over him.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to explain, Yanfa Little Lolita proactively defended Li Fan, "Don’t worry, it's indeed just a simple technique. It’s not a 'Curse'..."</p><p></p><p>Yanfa Little Lolita propped her chin with her hands, staring blankly ahead.</p><p></p><p>Countless characters seemed to flash in her big eyes synchronously.</p><p></p><p>Only after diverting his gaze did the targeted divine consciousness of the holy fetus Li Fan move away.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to write on the paper, and when he finally finished, the white paper turned into a stream of light and flew back into the hands of Yanfa Jue.</p><p></p><p>Little Lolita lowered her head into contemplation, remaining silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Uh..."</p><p></p><p>"The base technique is a bit complicated. Plus, your requirements are quite demanding."</p><p></p><p>"Well, there are a few more questions I need you to explain in detail..."</p><p></p><p>Pretending to ponder for a moment, Yanfa Little Lolita suddenly clapped the table, "To prevent your technique from leaking, come with me!"</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan could respond, a beam of light shot out from the giant spherical characters above, enveloping him.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the holy fetus Li Fan disappeared from the space.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Yanfa Little Lolita near the long table also vanished.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired Dao Guard revealed his figure with a helpless expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>He knew the temper of Yanfa Jue's child. Previously exposed by 'Fan Li,' feigning illness, encountering him again would surely lead to revenge and venting out frustrations.</p><p></p><p>But it was only a prank, unlikely to have any serious consequences.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired Dao Guard did not intervene.</p><p></p><p>"It's not bad to occasionally give her an outlet, to prevent sudden strikes." The white-haired Dao Guard thought.</p><p></p><p>In the endless sea of books world,</p><p></p><p>As soon as the holy fetus Li Fan entered this place, he felt surrounded by over a hundred sticks from all sides raining down on him.</p><p></p><p>"Hold on!"</p><p></p><p>At a critical moment, Li Fan shouted.</p><p></p><p>The sticks stopped just an inch in front of the holy fetus Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Yanfa Little Lolita appeared from above, hands on her hips, looking down at Li Fan, feeling very proud, "How about that! Do you know you're wrong now?"</p><p></p><p>"Apologize to me sincerely, and I'll spare you!"</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>"Humph!"</p><p></p><p>As if demonstrating, one of the sticks lightly tapped Li Fan's forehead.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at Yanfa Little Lolita with a smile that didn't reach his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The look in his eyes made her tense immediately, "What are you going to do..."</p><p></p><p>"I warn you, don't make a move!"</p><p></p><p>"If a fight really breaks out, you are not my match. I... haven't fought with anyone for many years, afraid I might accidentally kill you!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan just shook his head with a smile, not saying a word.</p><p></p><p>This further irritated Yanfa Jue, "You really are unbearable!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you admit your mistake or not? If you don't apologize to me, I will really beat you up!"</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the sticks almost touching his face, Li Fan sighed, "It seems... your illness is not fully cured yet."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Li Fan's words, Yanfa Little Lolita shuddered, "What illness? I don't have an illness."</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense!"</p><p></p><p>Although Yanfa Jue tried to cover it up, the panic on her little face was not feigned.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chuckled, "Since you aren't sick, why do you keep thinking about slacking off and resting?"</p><p></p><p>"On the surface, you want to trouble me, but in reality..."</p><p></p><p>"You just want to take advantage of this opportunity to rest again! You can't even let go of such a short time, showing how lazy you are!" Li Fan's eyes were sharp as he spoke sternly.</p><p></p><p>Yanfa Little Lolita trembled, "You... Why are you misunderstanding me!"</p><p></p><p>She looked at Li Fan with a face full of grievance, almost about to cry.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained expressionless, not swayed by her act.</p><p></p><p>However, after a brief pause, he changed the subject, "But, it's not entirely your fault."</p><p></p><p>"Moderation is natural. Even anyone working continuously for this long would want to rest."</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, she was being defended by him, Yanfa Little Lolita widened her eyes and nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Also, I see that your repeated strikes and laziness are not of your own will. It's just the drive of your instinct."</p><p></p><p>"The insatiable, the self-deceiving. Like how ordinary people drink water when thirsty, eat when hungry. It's your nature, unavoidable."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan spoke confidently, and Yanfa Little Lolita had never heard of such a theory before, finding herself deeply drawn in.</p><p></p><p>The sticks all over the place disappeared instantly, and she pondered, "So that's it. No wonder I couldn't control myself from slacking off this time, but every time I do, I feel guilty."</p><p></p><p>"That's the illness of a 'Hidden Mind'," Li Fan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Li Fan with a kind heart of a healer, Yanfa Little Lolita curiously asked, "Is that also a sickness? Can it be cured?"</p><p></p><p>After all, he could tell she was feigning sleep at a glance, and Yanfa Little Lolita had great faith in Li Fan's medical skills.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, no one had ever told her these things before, so naturally, she couldn't help but ask the doubts in her mind following Li Fan's train of thought.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled, "To cure this illness, it is difficult and easy to say."</p>

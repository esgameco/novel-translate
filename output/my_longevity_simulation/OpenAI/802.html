        <h1>Chapter 802</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This is also a manifestation of the immortal's heart.</p><p></p><p>For now, let's put aside the deeds of immortals beyond the mysterious and yellow realm. Li Fanping calmed his emotions and opened the true panel.</p><p></p><p>He has now experienced 119 lifetimes.</p><p></p><p>Current time: Anchored in 2 years.</p><p></p><p>Current location: The peak of Jielishan.</p><p></p><p>Lines of small characters flowed down like a waterfall.</p><p></p><p>Name: Li Fan</p><p></p><p>Realm: Mid-Golden Core</p><p></p><p>Physical age: 21/599</p><p></p><p>Mental age: 1368/9999</p><p></p><p>Progress of virtual energy conversion: 16%</p><p></p><p>Progress of anchoring energy: 0%</p><p></p><p>Current number of anchor points: 3</p><p></p><p>Current available anchor points: 2</p><p></p><p>Bound items: "Thousand Machinery Jade Sphere Golden Chapter," Taiyan Boat, Stop Monument (damaged), Blood of Ten Thousand People, Hua Dao Stone, End Separation Disc</p><p></p><p>Techniques: Mysterious Yellow Immortal Heart Spell, Sitting Immortal Profound, Cloud Water Illusion Dream Technique, Bodily Transformation Dao, Marvelous True Spirit Change, Ten Thousand Phenomenon Furnace Technique, Creation Baking Furnace Technique</p><p></p><p>Spiritual Skills: Chaos, Boundless Empty Law, Thread-Cutting to Death, Celestial Changes, Opposing the Five Elements Sword of Life and Death, Death Connection, Indestructible Killing Intent, Insect Binding</p><p></p><p>Due to choosing not to retain the realm of cultivation but choosing to retain the item "End Separation Disc," Li Fan is still at the mid-Golden Core realm. His maximum physical age has also returned from 999 to 599. </p><p></p><p>However, the maximum lifespan limit is basically inconsequential to Li Fan. After all, in so many lifetimes, except during his mortal period, he has seldom had a natural death. Moreover, now that he has unlocked the "Incarnation" function, this becomes even more insignificant.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the maximum mental age limit did not decrease with the regression in cultivation level. It seems to be related to Li Fan's heart and soul.</p><p></p><p>"Now, it only takes 6 years for 'True' to complete the energy charge. This means I can enter the Mysterious and Yellow Realm two years ahead of time."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze shifted downward onto the six items bound to "True," and he couldn't help but furrow his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Jade Sphere Golden Chapter, Taiyan Boat, Stop Monument..."</p><p></p><p>"These were all preserved during my struggles as a mortal in order to escape the Great Invisible World. Although they were extremely precious to me at the time."</p><p></p><p>"But now, they are of little use. Most importantly, they are always displayed on the true panel, which is bothersome."</p><p></p><p>"If there was a way to remove them, it would be great."</p><p></p><p>Just as he was thinking this, a faint prompt came from "True."</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible to consume a few anchor points to replace the already bound items?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but be slightly startled, squinting his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This is indeed a good thing. But there was no such replacement function before."</p><p></p><p>"The time needed for energy conversion is also reduced..."</p><p></p><p>"Has the ability of 'True' been enhanced?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment and carefully sensed the other functions of "True." </p><p></p><p>However, to some regret, he currently couldn't find any other changes.</p><p></p><p>"Previously, I speculated that the speed of 'True' charging is related to my soul and will. Now it seems that it may also be related to some other unknown factors."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's because I have seen true immortals and broadened my horizons?"</p><p></p><p>"Has my exploration degree increased again?"</p><p></p><p>Again, inadvertently thinking of the existence of true immortals, Li Fan became a bit distracted.</p><p></p><p>It took him nearly half a day to regain his composure.</p><p></p><p>He refocused his attention on the "True" panel.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing special to mention about the remaining techniques and spiritual skills.</p><p></p><p>Although they seemed very magnificent and their actual performance was indeed extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>One could say they were invincible at the same level and could even kill higher-ranking opponents.</p><p></p><p>But having seen Mr. Bai, the law transmission, and even the intervention of a "True Immortal," Li Fan felt that these things seemed somewhat fancy and not as practical as they appeared.</p><p></p><p>"In this world, it seems that realm surpasses everything."</p><p></p><p>"A level higher in realm means absolute strength that completely ignores reason."</p><p></p><p>"In ordinary joint Dao, one is not an opponent for the Longevity Heavenly Venerable."</p><p></p><p>"The so-called killing higher-ranked opponents is just big fish eating smaller fish within the same realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan fell silent for a while, with no sense of pride left in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But he soon regained his spirits.</p><p></p><p>"With 'True' in my hands, even the true immortals may not be beyond reach."</p><p></p><p>"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."</p><p></p><p>"Proceed step by step."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Sitting Immortal Profound' has already reached the joint Dao realm. For a long time to come, I won't have to worry about focusing on cultivating techniques."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Boundless Empty Law' is a spiritual skill that can enhance the soul. The soul is my only weakness. Whether facing Ruomu or Mr. Bai, I am almost defenseless..."</p><p></p><p>"I hope this spiritual skill derived from the Tianxuan Mirror can be more effective."</p><p></p><p>Having a clear understanding of the strength of those old monsters, Li Fan didn't think that relying solely on this spiritual skill would be enough to completely withstand them. The main thing was to be able to detect abnormalities as soon as he was 'contaminated,' and he was grateful for that.</p><p></p><p>Although, looking back at the various events that happened after his incarnation in the last life.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Mr. Bai was indeed a truly kind person who had no intention of snatching his "True." His series of operations, in comparison, seemed more like a clown, causing laughter.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Who could guarantee that he did not know the whereabouts of Li Fan's incarnation and therefore voluntarily performed for Li Fan to see?</p><p></p><p>So even if it happened again, Li Fan would still act the same way.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan always put his own safety first and would not easily trust anyone else.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, profits are directly proportional to risks.</p><p></p><p>In the last life, despite facing many dangers.</p><p></p><p>The gains were not few.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, it was confirmed that although the Law Transmission Heavenly Venerable was strong and dominated the Mysterious and Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>She was not an all-knowing entity.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan set off explosions of chaotic puppets all over the Mysterious and Yellow Realm and used the Medicine King True Cauldron during the chaos to quietly escape the Mysterious and Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>If the Law Transmission Heavenly Venerable truly knew everything about the Mysterious and Yellow Realm, then even with the material covering the Medicine King True Cauldron that shielded spiritual perception, and the influence of the chaotic script in the Mysterious and Yellow Realm...</p><p></p><p>The Medicine King True Cauldron would absolutely not have been able to escape from her control.</p><p></p><p>But that was exactly what happened.</p><p></p><p>This was enough to show that the Law Transmission Heavenly Venerable was still within the concept of "cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Just an incredibly powerful one.</p><p></p><p>One could deduce her actions based on experience and understanding.</p><p></p><p>As for the true immortals...</p><p></p><p>They were completely unpredictable and it would be best not to provoke them.</p><p></p><p>"The reason why the Law Transmission appears so formidable is that she has completed a new path. Later cultivators who practice this new path will contribute and increase her power."</p><p></p><p>"Thousands of years of accumulation have pushed her to an unpredictable level."</p><p></p><p>"To defeat the Law Transmission, one must first break her foundation."</p><p></p><p>"That's why after 'Building My Foundation' manifested in the mortal world, she didn't hesitate to appear in person to erase it."</p><p></p><p>-------------</p>

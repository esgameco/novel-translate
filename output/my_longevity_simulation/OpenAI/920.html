        <h1>Chapter 920</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"The 'Reverse Moral Sutra' is truly an extraordinary and unique cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>The scripture believes that the universe operates according to predetermined rules.</p><p></p><p>To maintain these rules, one needs a powerful source of energy.</p><p></p><p>By adhering to the natural order, one can achieve the highest realm.</p><p></p><p>However, by reversing these rules, one can also glimpse the realm of true immortals.</p><p></p><p>The principles of heaven and earth are vast! How can mere mortals achieve this?</p><p></p><p>Men represent yang, women represent yin.</p><p></p><p>If a man cultivates a pure yin body, he can take the first step in reversing the laws of heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>From this starting point, one can continuously manipulate the rules and order of the world, turning them into the nourishment for one's own ascension!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Qing was fascinated as he read the scripture, especially intrigued by the description of the practices in the later stages of the 'Reverse Moral Sutra' where one could change the world with a simple gesture.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Qing engrossed in the book, Zhao Shijie did not interrupt him.</p><p></p><p>Quietly watching Li Qing's profile, she appeared lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Only when Li Qing finally snapped out of it, did Zhao Ruoxi hand him a storage ring, saying, "For the next period of time, you'll have to rely on yourself."</p><p></p><p>"Even though you are just an outer disciple, breaking the rules will inevitably lead to punishment that cannot be avoided."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the worry in Li Qing's eyes, Zhao Shijie comforted him, saying, "It's nothing, just ten years of seclusion. It's a good opportunity for me to focus on my cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"When I come out of seclusion, I will take care of Qin Shou and avenge your grievances!"</p><p></p><p>"During this time, don't lose hope. This 'Reverse Moral Sutra' is mysterious in origin. Even my master has not heard of this technique in the secret sects, it's like it appeared out of nowhere."</p><p></p><p>"Focus on your cultivation. Your future achievements might even surpass mine."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After today's parting, we won't meet for ten years.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ruoxi felt reluctant to leave, as if she had endless words to say.</p><p></p><p>Until late into the night, amidst the flickering candlelight, Zhao Ruoxi and Li Qing held hands, locking eyes.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ruoxi's eyelashes trembled slightly as she gazed at Li Qing's flawless white skin and rosy lips.</p><p></p><p>An inexplicable heat rose within her.</p><p></p><p>Different emotions spread silently, and Zhao Ruoxi tightly held Li Qing's hand, gently moving in for a kiss.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing, feeling a jolt, instinctively tried to push Zhao Ruoxi away.</p><p></p><p>Sensing his thoughts, Zhao Ruoxi did not let go but instead held him tightly.</p><p></p><p>"It's okay..."</p><p></p><p>"I truly don't mind..."</p><p></p><p>"No matter how you change, as long as it's you."</p><p></p><p>Softly uttering these words, Zhao Ruoxi guided Li Qing's hand to her chest.</p><p></p><p>Feeling her heartbeat, gazing into Zhao Shijie's affectionate eyes, Li Qing eventually gave up resistance.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shijie extinguished the candle with a flick of her finger and set up barriers around them to prevent others from intruding.</p><p></p><p>Embracing each other, they moved to the bed.</p><p></p><p>A passionate night ensued, needless to say.</p><p></p><p>The next day, when Li Qing woke up, Zhao Ruoxi had already left.</p><p></p><p>Only the faint lingering fragrance in the air testified that last night was not just a dream.</p><p></p><p>"Turns out, it's possible to be intimate without certain parts."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing was somewhat dazed by the thought.</p><p></p><p>But soon, his attention shifted from those images to his current progress in the 'Reverse Moral Sutra.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Li Qing seemed to have an epiphany: "Perhaps my actions yesterday marked the initial transformation from yang to yin."</p><p></p><p>"So, the 'Reverse Moral Sutra' also took its first step."</p><p></p><p>"I have suddenly advanced from the middle stage of Qi refinement to the late stage!"</p><p></p><p>"The progress is unexpectedly fast..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's eyes flickered, his mind occupied with various thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Qin Shou..."</p><p></p><p>A figure suddenly appeared in Li Qing's mind.</p><p></p><p>"It's best for you not to die before I complete my cultivation. Hehehe..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's low chuckle echoed in the room.</p><p></p><p>Later, in the eyes of the outer disciples, Li Qing underwent a dramatic transformation.</p><p></p><p>His demeanor changed drastically, with less interaction with male outer disciples and better relations with female cultivators instead.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing was naturally handsome, making it hard for others to be wary.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the female disciples knew about his past and sympathized with him, leading to more care and attention towards him.</p><p></p><p>Thus, they grew closer.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, Li Qing moved to the female disciples' residence, taking turns to share a bed with them.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Li Qing's physique, appearance, even his voice, became more feminine.</p><p></p><p>Whenever his graceful figure passed through the sect, it captivated numerous male cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Even though they knew he was male, they couldn't help but be drawn to his natural beauty.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing remained cold towards the male disciples, showing no affection.</p><p></p><p>A year passed by in this manner.</p><p></p><p>In a secluded cave within the outer sect.</p><p></p><p>"This place in the outer sect's mountains has the most Yin Qi."</p><p></p><p>"It's perfect for my breakthrough today."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing sat bare-chested on a piece of black jade on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual force within him, akin to a millennium of cold ice, flowed slowly, covering his body with frost in the already chilly environment.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Qing himself did not expect that his cultivation of the 'Reverse Moral Sutra' would progress so smoothly.</p><p></p><p>It felt as if this technique was tailored for him. Within just a year, he advanced from the late stage of Qi refinement to the late stage of Foundation Building.</p><p></p><p>Today, he even needed to rely on the geographical advantage to directly impact the Golden Core realm!</p><p></p><p>The speed of his cultivation was beyond his imagination!</p><p></p><p>It even made him somewhat afraid.</p><p></p><p>During this time, he never revealed his true cultivation to avoid scrutiny from the Great Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the success was also attributed to the efforts of the female cultivators in the outer sect.</p><p></p><p>Within this year, any maiden with some looks had her Yin Qi absorbed by Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the 'Reverse Moral Sutra,' these female cultivators were deeply devoted to him, offering themselves and their possessions willingly.</p><p></p><p>With their wholehearted assistance, Li Qing lived a much more prosperous life than before.</p><p></p><p>He lacked nothing in spiritual stones and elixirs.</p><p></p><p>All these factors combined led to his rapid progress.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Qing had only one trace of Yang Qi left in his body.</p><p></p><p>By transforming it into Yin Qi, he could completely achieve the transformation from a male body to a 'pure Yin body.'</p><p></p><p>The 'Reverse Moral Sutra' could be considered a partial success.</p><p></p><p>Concentrating, he absorbed the surging Yin Qi in the black jade and the deep cave, silently circulating the 'Reverse Moral Sutra' in his mind as past scenes flashed before him.</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, I will bid farewell to the past completely."</p>

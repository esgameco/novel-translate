        <h1>Chapter 794</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The scattered and fleeing "Soulless" dried puppet branches, as well as the Medicine King True Cauldron soaring into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Even any object scattered in the venue may retain a little bit of Li Fan's true spirit.</p><p></p><p>The best time for identification has passed, and now, even he cannot tell where Li Fan went.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately...</p><p></p><p>He did not come for this purpose to begin with.</p><p></p><p>With a flick of his sleeve, a force surged from his body. The fluctuations of the character "Chaos" diffused within Changsheng Valley were slowly calmed.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai flew into the valley, in front of a group of children with slightly pale faces but determined eyes.</p><p></p><p>Flattening the ruins on the ground, Mr. Bai did not care, just sat down on the ground.</p><p></p><p>He revealed a serene and gentle smile, "Come over, children. There is not much time left."</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai's calm and gentle aura made people forget the calamity they had just experienced and involuntarily relaxed.</p><p></p><p>The group of children exchanged glances and obediently sat down.</p><p></p><p>These children, including Gu Xinghan, were the group abducted by the Medicine King Zong Fang Zaiji and then taught the "Foundation Building Method with Myself."</p><p></p><p>Zaiji had a secret method that discerned talents. Therefore, the aptitude of these kids was terrifyingly high. Each of them was not inferior to the initial Zhang Haobo or the departing people.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Fan wanted to rely on them to comprehend the "Foundation Building Method with Myself" and unlock the secret of "Realizing Oneself." Then the End Plate could completely shield the "Heavenly Mysterious Treasure Mirror."</p><p></p><p>However, things did not go as planned. The situation in this world suddenly changed. When Li Fan, who discovered his abnormality, was frightened by Mr. Bai, he just wanted to escape for his life, but there was no guarantee that anyone among them could succeed.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Mr. Bai, who was synchronized with Li Fan's memories, also knew about this.</p><p></p><p>"How is your practice of the 'Foundation Building Method with Myself' going?" He asked gently, trying to sound relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Facing a teacher-like figure evaluating their knowledge, the children were a bit nervous.</p><p></p><p>For a while, none of them dared to speak first.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to Mr. Bai's continuous encouragement, they started speaking one after another, expressing their insights.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai listened attentively, nodding slightly from time to time.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, he inspected the children's physical conditions separately, with a pensive expression.</p><p></p><p>This scene caught the eyes of the three Harmony Daoists of the Medicine King Zong.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, their strength had completely recovered after Mr. Bai dispersed the Chaos Domain. However, they dared not act recklessly against the terrifying power of the other party.</p><p></p><p>They sent away other irrelevant disciples and waited obediently on the side, exchanging puzzled looks as they watched Mr. Bai engaging earnestly with the children.</p><p></p><p>"Lao Fang, you are knowledgeable. Can you explain what happened?" Liu San glanced at the lifeless body of Li Fan and asked through voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>"Why say more? It's so obvious! Our Sect Master provoked a powerful figure he shouldn't have and was chased to his door!" </p><p></p><p>"After using all means, we still couldn't resist at all. In order to prevent the Medicine King Zong from being implicated, he chose to apologize resolutely by death..."</p><p></p><p>Zaiji sighed, "I'm too familiar with this kind of thing."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan remained silent, while Liu San's eyes twitched.</p><p></p><p>"Death might be for the best." An unexpected thought flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the hidden thoughts of the three Harmony Daoists of the Medicine King Zong.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai seemed to have truly forgotten all other matters, patiently discussing the "Foundation Building Method" with the children, not looking down on them because of their young age.</p><p></p><p>Every word spoken by the children received a response.</p><p></p><p>Friendly attitude.</p><p></p><p>As a result, in a short period of time, these children grew fond of Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>From being passive to active, they chattered and shared with him about the difficulties and insights encountered while practicing the "Foundation Building Method".</p><p></p><p>After hearing about the specific situations of the children, Mr. Bai quickly proposed thoughtful guidance for each of them.</p><p></p><p>Encouraging them to try practicing again.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the children closed their eyes one by one, immersing themselves in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai never took his eyes off them, carefully observing every change in the children.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, in the Profound Yellow Boundary, it was the "Weirdness of False Heaven and Earth for Building the Foundation."</p><p></p><p>Though the "Foundation Building Method with Myself" seemed to be still within the new system, in reality, it had broken free from constraints, making it a rebellious practice.</p><p></p><p>Hence, soon after these children tried again, one after another, they opened their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Their cultivation once again ended in failure.</p><p></p><p>Patiently, Mr. Bai inquired about the new problems they encountered one by one.</p><p></p><p>After checking their physical condition, he quickly suggested an improved cultivation plan.</p><p></p><p>Watching this scene, Liu San and others were inexplicably shaken.</p><p></p><p>"To teach according to the aptitude, treating all beings equally."</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>As ancient Harmony Daoists and elders of the Sect, their vision was naturally not low.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, they saw how amazing Mr. Bai's actions were.</p><p></p><p>To be able to cultivate oneself and teach others was completely different!</p><p></p><p>So, they still didn't dare to disturb.</p><p></p><p>Zaiji had an idea and took out a recording stone, planning to secretly record the scene of Mr. Bai teaching.</p><p></p><p>This small action naturally didn't escape Mr. Bai's notice.</p><p></p><p>He turned his head and cast a glance.</p><p></p><p>Liu San's breath stopped immediately, afraid that Zaiji's actions might offend the strong figure.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Mr. Bai didn't choose to investigate further.</p><p></p><p>He just continued teaching the children.</p><p></p><p>"He..."</p><p></p><p>"He is not only teaching but also learning."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yushan, who had been silent, seemed to have discovered something.</p><p></p><p>With a hint of shock in her eyes, she said through voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Foundation Building Method'..." This mysterious Foundation Building Method was passed on to these children by Li Fan before his fall. Liu San recalled the contents of the method, listened carefully to Mr. Bai's explanation, and his eyes gradually brightened.</p><p></p><p>And so, Mr. Bai and these outstanding children.</p><p></p><p>Became mutual teachers.</p><p></p><p>With a total of thirty-five children with different constitutions as experimental subjects.</p><p></p><p>Constantly experimenting and refining the "Foundation Building Method with Myself."</p><p></p><p>This originally extremely difficult rebellious art was also undergoing version updates at an unimaginable speed.</p><p></p><p>Time passed slowly in this process.</p><p></p><p>Finally...</p><p></p><p>The first child succeeded in building the foundation.</p><p></p><p>An inexplicable aura descended on the scene.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xinghan suddenly stood up, looking at his renewed body, his little face full of excitement, "Sir..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, the entire Changsheng Valley suddenly began to shake violently.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai's smile faded, and he stood in front of the children.</p><p></p><p>Looking up at the sky, he said, "Finally, they have arrived."</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>End of the vote request, the goal was 3579 votes.

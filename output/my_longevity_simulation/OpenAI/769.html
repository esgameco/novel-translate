        <h1>Chapter 769</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>His face immediately darkened.</p><p></p><p>"Even a hundred meticulous plans will eventually expose a flaw."</p><p></p><p>"Liu San, who usually looks so unreliable, surprisingly has such deep thoughts."</p><p></p><p>Yes, in that seemingly ordinary conversation just now, Xu Bai made a mistake.</p><p></p><p>That mistake was when Liu San informed him of a disciple successfully building the foundation, he fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>This silence was due to his lack of trust in Liu San.</p><p></p><p>Because he knew the difficulty of successfully building the foundation. He knew it was blatantly impossible.</p><p></p><p>So he doubted that this might be a trap, an excuse for Liu San to deceive him and lure him back.</p><p></p><p>According to common sense, upon hearing those words, he should have been surprised or puzzled. He should have immediately questioned the authenticity of Liu San's words.</p><p></p><p>However, he remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Although he could have come up with countless reasons to explain this silence,</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai understood in his heart that it was futile.</p><p></p><p>Because Liu San did not speak continuously; he deliberately paused after the first half of his sentence, waiting for Xu Bai's reaction.</p><p></p><p>This was a kind of test.</p><p></p><p>Liu San had achieved what he wanted. From Xu Bai's brief silence, he discerned Xu Bai's lack of trust in him.</p><p></p><p>In a battle between experts, even a slight disadvantage results in defeat.</p><p></p><p>"However, things haven't escalated to the point of no return yet. It's not easy to break the restrictions of 'True Temptation and Fruition.' Although they have sensed something amiss and confirmed their suspicions, they still cannot oppose me."</p><p></p><p>"Besides influencing their thoughts, the most crucial point is that the Xuanhuang Cauldron is still in my hands."</p><p></p><p>"With many Medicine King Sect cultivators inside the cauldron as hostages, they dare not act rashly."</p><p></p><p>"For now, let's set them aside and wait until later..." A hint of fierceness flashed in Xu Bai's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The relationship between the Medicine King Sect and Xu Bai was now in a strange state of balance.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai communicated with them remotely only through message talismans.</p><p></p><p>And Liu San and the others continued their actions as usual, seemingly unaware of any anomalies.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Xu Bai took a trip back to the empire.</p><p></p><p>Flying over the capital city, Xu Bai faintly sensed a tinge of bloodlust lingering in the air.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, a purge had just concluded.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Bai showed up, Xiao Qing quickly came to greet him.</p><p></p><p>Inside the tall palace, Xu Bai once again met the Empress and Xiao Hong.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, Xu Bai noticed that in just a short time, the Empress had transformed from a young girl to a voluptuous woman.</p><p></p><p>And the gaze she directed at Xu Bai had lost a bit of timidity and gained some confidence.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that your empire still has some hidden techniques up its sleeve." Xu Bai said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The Empress chuckled, her voluptuous body trembling slightly, "The empire has existed for thousands of years and has never relied solely on one path for survival."</p><p></p><p>"You should understand that, right?"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, her deep, bright eyes firmly fixed on Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>They revealed a mix of charm and blatant temptation.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai, with eyes as clear as a lake, remained completely calm. Instead, he showed a bright and genuine smile.</p><p></p><p>The Empress's disguise suddenly broke, revealing a hint of panic and shyness on her face.</p><p></p><p>"Forgive me for making you laugh." At this moment, Xiao Hong bent slightly, standing in front of the Empress.</p><p></p><p>The Empress took a deep breath, closed her eyes for a while, before regaining her composure.</p><p></p><p>Rather than blaming or ridiculing her for attempting to seduce him beyond her capabilities, Xu Bai asked with interest, "If I’m not mistaken, is the Empress pregnant?"</p><p></p><p>The three present individuals felt somewhat awkward upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing waved her hand, setting up a barrier around them, before quietly explaining, "After you left, we followed your advice and conducted a purge on the noble families of the empire. Anyone whose will did not align with ours was captured."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the empire has existed for centuries. The power accumulated by these noble families is not to be underestimated."</p><p></p><p>"Before taking action, we had already considered the possible consequences of failure. In order to avoid the extinction of the empire’s bloodline, the Empress had already used the Sacred Blood Fetal Transformation technique early on."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing glanced at the Empress before continuing, "Actually, after years of continuous research by the imperial family, the Sacred Blood Fetal Transformation technique, originally taught by the master, has greatly improved."</p><p></p><p>"It can now assist in childbirth even when one's own conditions are inadequate."</p><p></p><p>"The offspring born under such circumstances can be said to be a sort of incarnation rather than the next generation."</p><p></p><p>"However, there are downsides. The incarnation cannot inherit cultivation and is just a simple body."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing stopped there and did not elaborate further.</p><p></p><p>Without pressing for more details, Xu Bai, in the presence of Xiao Qing and the others, announced the approval of the inspection.</p><p></p><p>After being evaluated by several elders, they unanimously agreed that the various technologies displayed by the empire were worthy of investment by the Universal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The empire would also become one of the few small worlds under the protection of the Universal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Having said that, Xu Bai took out three Terminal Disks from his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>He then explained how to amplify the effects of the Terminal Disks and how to conceal the entrance to a small world with a formation.</p><p></p><p>Among the three, the Empress seemed baffled, while Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong showed signs of delight.</p><p></p><p>With utmost solemnity, Xu Bai put away the Terminal Disks and, under their gaze, the Empress handed over a storage ring.</p><p></p><p>The ring bore an engraving of an ancient Heavenly Mandate Xuan Bird, emitting an aged aura indicating its long existence.</p><p></p><p>It closely resembled Xu Ke's spiritual pet, Little Black.</p><p></p><p>"All the items we previously displayed are stored inside this ring."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing and Xiao Hong looked at the storage ring with a touch of nostalgia.</p><p></p><p>"This was left by the master, unused until today. Using it now to trade for the empire’s future, hopefully, he won't blame us." Xiao Qing said somewhat sadly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai only glanced briefly at it, including all the information, such as “Integration with Ten Thousand Beasts,” stored within. He did not seek to verify their authenticity immediately.</p><p></p><p>After putting away the ring, he looked back at Xiao Qing and others.</p><p></p><p>Sensing that Xu Bai had more to say, Xiao Qing and the others met his gaze with inquisitive looks.</p><p></p><p>"The trade between the empire and the Universal Alliance has been finalized."</p><p></p><p>"Next, I have a personal trade proposal with all of you. Are you willing to hear it?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing's expression turned serious, "Please proceed, fellow Taoist."</p><p></p><p>"I am very interested in the improved Sacred Blood Fetal Transformation technique." Xu Bai said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing's expression changed slightly, indicating a possible refusal.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 758</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Liu Wenyu was full of shock, murmuring quietly in his mouth. </p><p></p><p>But his eyes were fixed dead on the top of his head at the final disk, not even sensing his urge to reach out and touch it.</p><p></p><p>As a spy lurking in the Five Elders Association, he had almost been pushed to a dead-end by the Tianxuan treasure mirror, so he knew too clearly the value of this thing.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Liu Wenyu couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"[Heaven Shielding Circular Disk]," Xu Bai said lightly. With a thought, the final circular disk instantly disappeared, leaving Liu Wenyu grasping at air.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Liu Wenyu suddenly come to his senses.</p><p></p><p>Reluctantly removing his gaze from the final circular disk, he solemnly bowed and said, "Friend, it must be something important for you to visit this time."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai snorted, "Yes. I'm here to investigate!"</p><p></p><p>"What?" Liu Wenyu was suddenly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Not long ago, through a Daoist practitioner controlled by the [True Inducing Fruit], there were signs of him losing control. Fortunately, we discovered it in time and took other measures before he succeeded in rebellion. That's the only way to stabilize him. Otherwise, our [Reverse Heaven Assembly] will suffer heavy losses this time," Xu Bai said harshly.</p><p></p><p>"You said that [True Inducing Fruit] was created by Heaven; it is guaranteed to be foolproof. How could such a loophole exist?" </p><p></p><p>"Only grandiose statements! No wonder you've been suppressed by the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals to this extent," Xu Bai glanced at him, speaking slowly.</p><p></p><p>"The [True Inducing Fruit] failed?" Liu Wenyu looked shocked, but soon he shook his head repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"This is impossible. As long as Heaven exists, Daoist practitioners cannot go against His power," Liu Wenyu said firmly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai said in a heavy tone, "But the fact that the Daoist practitioner lost control did happen. What is the reason for this?"</p><p></p><p>"Friend, please don't rush. Please explain the details of the incident."</p><p></p><p>So Xu Bai omitted names and detailed information, fabricating an incident involving a Daoist practitioner who, after realizing he was being controlled, was planning rebellion.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a while, Liu Wenyu replied, "It might be that the method of using [True Inducing Fruit] is wrong."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai was furious, "Are you saying it's our fault? We strictly followed your initial instructions."</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu explained quickly, "The [True Inducing Fruit] can distort a practitioner's thoughts, making them believe even the most absurd things. But practitioners are not puppets; they have their own thoughts. If the lies are too clumsy, they might not doubt but will try to verify them in various ways when they perceive contradictions with their beliefs."</p><p></p><p>"For example, if a Daoist practitioner is instilled with the idea "he is actually a weak ordinary person without any power," he will adopt the behavior of an ordinary person. But if one day, he accidentally kills another Nascent Infant cultivator, the conflict between fact and belief will force him to find reasons to convince himself."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, the discrepancy between belief and reality could drive the practitioner into madness."</p><p></p><p>"For instance, if you instill in a Daoist practitioner the idea of eternal loyalty through the [True Inducing Fruit], he may still remain loyal to you but might take actions... of extremes."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Liu Wenyu continued, "They might think the world of Xuanyellow is full of dangers. If they lack the strength, exposure could lead to death. So, they think that by imprisoning you in a certain dungeon to cultivate until reaching the Daoist stage, they will be able to travel safely in the world of Xuanyellow."</p><p></p><p>"Although it may seem twisted and unreasonable to others, in their perception, it is a normal and smooth course of action."</p><p></p><p>"In our Five Elders Association, there have been cases where loyal practitioners escaped to the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals. They remained loyal but believed that the strength of the Dao Master was unpredictable, and we couldn't compete. In the long run, surrendering and merging with the Alliance were the only ways to survive."</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu sighed, "He was preaching, even trying to persuade members of our Five Elders Association."</p><p></p><p>"There are quite a number of such individuals. We call them [Demon-Crazy Cultivators]. It's the result of Tianzun's incompleteness of against-logic, conflicting with the overall heavenly principles of Xuanyellow."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if everyone could be like [Carefree Tianzun], with divine power spread throughout Xuanyellow, such things wouldn't happen."</p><p></p><p>While Liu Wenyu explained, Xu Bai gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"When we set the lies in the first place, we were as thorough as possible. Who could have predicted this happening..." Xu Bai snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu also felt helpless, "After all, it's hard to control Daoist practitioners. If it was that easy, wouldn't our Five Elders Association have already unified Xuanyellow and not fallen into this situation?"</p><p></p><p>"What should we do now? This is such an important matter, why wasn't it clarified in the beginning of the transaction? It's impossible to let him go, long-term house arrest will raise suspicions. Are you suggesting we kill him, blaming it on you?" Xu Bai asked.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu was taken aback and said quickly, "Please don't act rashly, friend. In my opinion, there is still a way to save the situation."</p><p></p><p>"One is to use [True Inducing Fruit] on him again to repair the flaws."</p><p></p><p>"Secondly..."</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenyu's expression became a bit strange, "To actively reveal the truth to him and then convince him to overcome his 'demonic craziness.'"</p><p></p><p>"Could you be clearer in your explanation?" Xu Bai's face darkened.</p><p></p><p>Lowering his voice, Liu Wenyu continued, "Let's take the example of the practitioner who fled to the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals. His reason for fleeing was simply that he believed the Five Elders Association was no match for the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals. If we can use solid evidence to convince him that the strength of the Five Elders Association surpasses that of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals or at least stands on equal footing, he will return to our camp."</p><p></p><p>"After all, his unwavering belief in the Five Elders Association hasn't changed."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai instantly understood the other's meaning.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if this 'convincing" process is combined with the [True Inducing Fruit], the effect will be greater," Liu Wenyu added.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Xu, do you still need the [True Inducing Fruit] for that?" he inquired.</p>

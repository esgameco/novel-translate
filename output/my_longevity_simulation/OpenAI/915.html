        <h1>Chapter 915</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Even the powerful experts in the Xuanhuang realm can only go against some of the rules of heaven and earth. Therefore, the second major part of the "Tianbu Records" is about how to mend flaws, strengthen oneself.</p><p></p><p>Breaking free from the constraints of the so-called cultivation system and starting from the source of life.</p><p></p><p>Listing over a hundred possible methods to break through one's limitations.</p><p></p><p>The last major part of the Tianbu Records, which occupies the most content, elaborates on how to "heal the heavens".</p><p></p><p>If abnormalities occur in the course of the celestial path, it will be like an illness in life, with various "symptoms" emerging.</p><p></p><p>Treating the problem at its root is the only way to cure it.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, the Tianbu Records is not a cultivation technique. It is a summary of the Tianyi's experiences in self-cultivation, a concrete combination of methodology and practical experience.</p><p></p><p>Many of the perspectives and creative ideas in it are unheard of by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The various phenomena of celestial anomalies recorded in it have also broadened his horizons.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan can almost be certain that the Tianyi has visited more than one cultivation realm with three-digit numbers. Without observing the celestial path in more than three cultivation realms, it is impossible to write such a magnificent masterpiece.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan read it with great fascination, feeling a few more respects and cautions towards the Tianyi in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Though he managed to make the Tianyi believe he was the descendant of Tianjue due to his advantage in prophetic information, Tianjue himself was erratic and his mental state fluctuated, making it difficult to verify Li Fan's claims in general situations.</p><p></p><p>Yet for the Tianyi, there might be ways to forcibly probe into Tianjue's mind and memories.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan clearly remembered that when confronting Tianjue and Master before, the Tianyi revealed its true self for just a moment and subdued the deranged Tianjue, even performing a "surgery" on him.</p><p></p><p>So, even though Li Fan gained a minor victory, he did not forget everything.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he tried to forcefully imprint the vast Tianbu Records into his mind as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>If the Tianyi discovered he was deceived and came looking for him, Li Fan would be the first to respond.</p><p></p><p>Even if all his setups in this world went in vain, having the Tianbu Records was definitely not a loss.</p><p></p><p>However, this was just Li Fan's worst-case scenario.</p><p></p><p>In reality, based on Li Fan's deductions, he possessed the legacy of the Cloud Water Celestial Palace and Tianjue, which truly made him their descendant.</p><p></p><p>As for how he got this legacy…</p><p></p><p>For the Tianyi, it might not even matter.</p><p></p><p>As long as Li Fan's possession of the "true" fact was not exposed, the Tianyi would not harm him at all!</p><p></p><p>The content of the Tianbu Records was profound and obscure, even with Li Fan's current knowledge reserve, studying it was quite strenuous.</p><p></p><p>"In a past life of the Tiansuo Ling Formation, there was a method called the Tianbu Records before the arrival of the Xuan Network."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance forced cultivators to practice…"</p><p></p><p>"This finally led to the ultimate transformation of the Heavenly Mirror towards the Xuan Network."</p><p></p><p>"Both were to mend their own shortcomings. Looking at it now, these two share similarities. Perhaps they were originally indistinguishable."</p><p></p><p>During the reading process, Li Fan suddenly recalled his past experiences with reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>Aligning the Heavenly Mirror with the Xuan Network, the process of thoroughly replacing the heavens with oneself combined with the theories in the Tianbu Records, brought various enlightenments to Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>He was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Immersed in his study, Li Fan lost track of time.</p><p></p><p>When he reached the final section of the Tianbu Records, discussing the ultimate means of healing the heavens, he was shaken to the core, instantly becoming alert.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>His eyes filled with an incredulous light, his body trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath, forcibly suppressing the shock within him.</p><p></p><p>He carefully and repeatedly read the discourse over a dozen times.</p><p></p><p>It was only one of Tianyi's speculations, one he hadn't even practiced before.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>"Floating through the void array, capturing other worlds, blessed lands..."</p><p></p><p>"The ancient battle..."</p><p></p><p>"Cloud Water Celestial Palace, Tianjue..."</p><p></p><p>"The tumultuous changes in the Xuanhuang realm over thousands of years..."</p><p></p><p>Many clues from the past flashed through Li Fan's mind, confirming each other with the content.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but inhale a cool breath.</p><p></p><p>"If it is really like this..."</p><p></p><p>A glimmer of shock flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He was no longer focusing on reading the Tianbu Records.</p><p></p><p>If his speculation was true, then the true strength of the Tianyi...</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan, usually self-assured, felt an urgent need to verify this hypothesis.</p><p></p><p>However, ultimately, he suppressed it forcibly.</p><p></p><p>"No, it must wait until next life."</p><p></p><p>"Besides the Tianyi, only I should know the content of the Tianbu Records. If I probe this world, I will definitely expose myself!"</p><p></p><p>"In the next life, everything else can be put aside. This matter must be verified first..."</p><p></p><p>"If it is really like this..."</p><p></p><p>Due to the smugness brought by deceiving the Tianyi disappearing in Li Fan's heart, a rare sense of urgency emerged, pushing him to verify this conjecture as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>In the end, after much contemplation, Li Fan decided to finish reading the Tianbu Records.</p><p></p><p>"Not to fully learn it."</p><p></p><p>"But the perspectives within, perhaps can be borrowed and transformed for personal use."</p><p></p><p>"Extracting the essence, merging it with my strengths, deriving and creating a Tianbu Records of my own."</p><p></p><p>With such thoughts, Li Fan's consciousness began to skim through the ocean of knowledge in the Tianbu Records again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Sky Sword Sect, the Sword Tomb.</p><p></p><p>The avatar Li Qing sat next to the black sword, nurturing it with his own insights into the sword dao.</p><p></p><p>All transmitted from his main body.</p><p></p><p>"When the heavens lack, I will fill it myself."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing savored the mysteries between the lines, his eyes shining brighter and brighter.</p><p></p><p>Due to the restrictions of his main body, Li Qing did not know where this profound method originated from.</p><p></p><p>However, judging by its intricacy, it was evidently not an enlightenment of his main body.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing, who was very clear about the aptitude of his main body, almost confirmed this.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that my main body must have had some kind of encounter..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing no longer worried about other matters, but concentrated on studying this method.</p><p></p><p>"I see..."</p><p></p><p>"The sword dao is one of the celestial paths. If the celestial path may lack, so can the sword dao."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, the extraordinary nature of the wooden sword of heaven instinctively wants to mend itself. This black sword is one of its instinctive attempts."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's eyes sparkled.</p><p></p><p>"In reality, the extraordinary nature of the wooden sword of heaven is already inclined towards perfection. To progress further, it's not easy."</p><p></p><p>"Yet perhaps another path can be taken, starting from another 'dao'."</p><p></p><p>"It is said that a stone from another hill can be used to polish a jade."</p>

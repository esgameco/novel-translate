        <h1>Chapter 908</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Perhaps it was because she had truly benefited from cultivation, her faith in the "Red Dust Compassionate True Immortal" was the purest and most fervent.</p><p></p><p>Compared to a short while ago, Li Fan was able to observe the situation around her.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he could even occasionally sense the thoughts in her mind.</p><p></p><p>"Thanks to the grace bestowed by the True Immortal, I was able to lead everyone back safely from the conquest of the Fire World."</p><p></p><p>"I dare not go back on my previous promise. From now on, I am willing to serve you faithfully for the rest of my life, until death do us part."</p><p></p><p>Suyu Qingqing respectfully knocked her head a few times towards her own carved faceless stone statue.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, Li Fan noticed a strange force breaking through the restrictions of time and space, descending upon himself.</p><p></p><p>It was only a thin thread of energy, almost negligible compared to his vast spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was somewhat similar to the feedback cultivation from sitting in meditation, but the essence of the energy was different.</p><p></p><p>After this force appeared in his body, it was distinctly separate from spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Instead of surging towards the lower abdomen (dantian), it lurked towards Li Fan's sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>How could Li Fan, who had always been on guard against the Faceless True Immortal, let it succeed?</p><p></p><p>A colorful divine light emerged, forming layer after layer of light cocoons, enveloping this strange energy.</p><p></p><p>After being sealed, the reaction of this energy was somewhat unexpected to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Instead of fiercely resisting, it just quietly settled down.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Li Fan's own spiritual power emitting a dazzling white light, this energy, although extremely weak, appeared as if shimmering like gold.</p><p></p><p>Its grade seemed to be slightly higher than spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully observed this golden energy, remaining silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>He knew that this was due to the effect of the Faceless Stone Statue, transforming Suyu Qingqing's gratitude and faith into this form.</p><p></p><p>"The legendary power of faith? Or perhaps the power of sentient beings' aspirations?"</p><p></p><p>"Or something else?"</p><p></p><p>"There is too little information, so let's call it the power of aspiration for the time being."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>Even though he knew that this golden aspiration was like a poisonous candy, at this moment, he had no choice but to swallow it.</p><p></p><p>The connection between the deity and him had been established, and unless he severed it immediately, no matter how far he was from the stone statue, this golden aspiration would always appear within him.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, this golden aspiration was not a one-time occurrence.</p><p></p><p>As Suyu Qingqing continued to devoutly pray, not long after, another thread of golden aspiration formed.</p><p></p><p>Following the same trajectory, it surged towards Li Fan's sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Killing Suyu Qingqing would be futile."</p><p></p><p>"Those cultivators who made vows before the statue have actually become machines generating golden aspirations."</p><p></p><p>"Although they may not be like Suyu Qingqing right now, with the passage of time, the subtle influence of the Faceless Stone Statue on them will grow deeper."</p><p></p><p>"Someday they will be like this too."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, surprised but composed, pondering countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>While using the colorful divine light to precisely separate these golden aspirations and isolate them.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the previous convergence, this time proved that Li Fan's reincarnations through the ages and his collection of various secrets were not in vain.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he came up with a solution.</p><p></p><p>After some experimentation, the effect was surprisingly satisfactory.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan released the lock of the colorful divine light on the golden aspirations and forcibly guided these alien energies to slowly gather in his lower abdomen.</p><p></p><p>When they were still not behaving and seemed to want to restlessly move towards his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>A figure suddenly formed in his lower abdomen.</p><p></p><p>Like a vortex, it absorbed those golden aspirations that were just about to move away.</p><p></p><p>"It works indeed." Li Fan felt pleased.</p><p></p><p>This figure was the "Calamity Body" he used when his cultivation was bottlenecked in the past, to store excess cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It had been a long time since he had been stuck in a bottleneck, and with no overflow or wasted feedback cultivation, this method of the Calamity Body had not been used for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, facing the troublesome golden aspirations now, it showed remarkable effectiveness.</p><p></p><p>The Calamity Body secret technique originated from the "Supreme Primordial True Scripture."</p><p></p><p>In the ancient cultivation world, occasionally, cultivators would cultivate too fast, leading to unstable foundations.</p><p></p><p>Different sects had various methods to deal with this.</p><p></p><p>The method adopted by the Supreme Sect was to form a figure in the dantian to contain the excess cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As the Supreme Sect believed that an unstable foundation was one of the calamities of cultivation, this figure used to cope with calamities was also known as the "Calamity Body."</p><p></p><p>"The supreme sect's true inheritance, originating from the Great Master of Heaven's Capital."</p><p></p><p>"And the Great Master of Heaven's Capital, like the Mystical King of Heaven, possessed a semi-immortal body. It is highly likely that they also inherited various immortality from the immortal realms during the calamities of that year."</p><p></p><p>"Being able to deal with these golden aspirations that clearly exceeded the first level of spiritual power is not surprising."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered to himself.</p><p></p><p>With the containment of the Calamity Body, the golden aspirations seemed to have found a sanctuary.</p><p></p><p>Following that, without Li Fan deliberately guiding them, they would naturally gather towards the golden Calamity Body in his dantian.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"The crisis is temporarily resolved."</p><p></p><p>"This Calamity Body is a separate entity that can be discarded at any time without affecting me."</p><p></p><p>"Even in the worst case, if this Calamity Body becomes a separate individual like Xu Bai from the 115th generation. It has no consciousness, making it easier to handle many situations."</p><p></p><p>"At the moment, it's just a simple crystallization of energy with no other anomalies."</p><p></p><p>After carefully observing and confirming once again, Li Fan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>He had a feeling that as he absorbed and contained more golden aspirations, this Calamity Body in the future might even be able to be directly detonated.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was unsure of how powerful the explosion would be at that time.</p><p></p><p>But he understood that triggering the explosion directly might just be the most basic way to use the golden aspirations.</p><p></p><p>"Lick the blood off the blade..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes were profound as he murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>He knew very well the risks that the golden aspirations might hide behind.</p><p></p><p>But with the Calamity Body as a safeguard, he didn't need to be overly cautious about everything.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was contemplating how to deal with the golden aspirations in the future.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he felt another abnormal movement in his body!</p><p></p><p>And the source of this abnormality...</p><p></p><p>Was none other than the dark gold skull and the gray mold residing within the Five Elements Grand Heavenly Realm, sealed tightly by the colorful divine light!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, with the accumulation of the golden aspirations by the Calamity Body reaching a certain level, even though it was sealed inside the Grand Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>The gray mold also sensed the presence of the golden aspirations.</p><p></p><p>Like a wild beast that had been hungry for a long time, it suddenly caught a whiff of a strong smell of blood.</p><p></p><p>For the first time, the gray mold surged out from the skull, crazily attacking the surrounding walls of colorful divine light.</p><p></p><p>The colorful divine light was being consumed at a terrifying speed.</p>

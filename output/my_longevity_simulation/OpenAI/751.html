        <h1>Chapter 751</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Putting their hopes on the improbable existence of a great hero, who knows if they will ever appear?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai shook his head repeatedly, "It seems that the organization has overestimated your value. Êñ∞ùüîùüóÊõ∏Âêßùü®ùü´‚ì¢‚ìó‚ì§‚ìß.‚ìí‚ìû‚ìú"</p><p></p><p>Facing Xu Bai's contempt, the Empress showed no sign of anger.</p><p></p><p>Instead, her eyes flashed with a firm gaze, "We have waited for thousands of years, eagerly anticipating the arrival of the savior, who will eventually come!"</p><p></p><p>"Before the Xuanhuang Realm falls into ruin completely."</p><p></p><p>"This is the devout belief passed down from the Saint Emperor. Regardless of the policies set by the imperial dynasties, they cannot contradict it."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Xu Bai, who was initially about to mock, suddenly remembered something and fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, the only one who could make Xu Ke so convinced was Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>"So, Mr. Bai foresaw that in several years, a miraculous figure will descend to save the Xuanhuang Realm from turmoil?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai couldn't help feeling a sense of absurdity.</p><p></p><p>However, he remembered the Doom Sect that had been haunting him and seemed to have a connection with him.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps... this was not an impossible possibility.</p><p></p><p>At least the "chosen one for calamity" selected by the Doom Sect seemed to point to himself.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai couldn't help but furrow his brow.</p><p></p><p>"Looking at Mr. Bai's cultivation of a new breed of Boundary Breaking Whale, which managed to move many mortal worlds away from the Xuanhuang Realm, the Empire's ultimate plan is actually in line with the other mortal worlds."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that the Empire has a slightly stronger subjective initiative and can move further away from the Xuanhuang Realm. The other worlds are just forced to accept it, not understanding what really happened."</p><p></p><p>The difference in origin lies in the connection between Xu Ke and Mr. Bai. Perhaps this was what Land Yasheng entrusted to Xu Ke.</p><p></p><p>"The current issue is, can Mr. Bai and the Doom Sect really predict the existence of me, as well as the existence of 'Huan Zhen,' before a thousand years have passed?"</p><p></p><p>Just a moment later, Xu Bai dismissed this speculation.</p><p></p><p>"Huan Zhen" could turn the truth into falsehood and the reality into illusion with just a thought, restoring everything in the world to its original state.</p><p></p><p>This ability was far beyond even the legendary Immortals.</p><p></p><p>If Mr. Bai and the Doom Sect were really able to predict the existence of "Huan Zhen," why would they need to wait for a savior? With their own abilities, they could likely solve the troubles of the Immortal Domain.</p><p></p><p>"The Doom Sect's method should be similar to Senior Zhang's. After meeting certain conditions, their attention will be drawn. They might even cast a wide net. The so-called 'chosen one for calamity' is not just me."</p><p></p><p>"And Mr. Bai..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai fell silent.</p><p></p><p>He still didn't know why he was so sure that someone would come to save the Xuanhuang Realm after a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Surely it couldn't solely be because he held onto hope?</p><p></p><p>"The infinite future holds infinite possibilities. This also means that, no matter how small the likelihood, under the premise of 'infinity,' everything is bound to happen." The words of Emperor Yi suddenly emerged in Xu Bai's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, among the countless futures Mr. Bai had derived, there really was a possibility of saving the Xuanhuang Realm. Just like what I saw in the last life, even though the Xuanhuang Realm experienced decline and ruin, it eventually welcomed the sunlight of revival. Although it's not clear yet what happened in between. However, in a sense, if the Empire can persevere until that time, perhaps their strategy will indeed be successful."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai seemed to have a realization.</p><p></p><p>And the Empress, watching Xu Bai lost in thoughts, did not interrupt him.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, if it's my ancestors' judgment, there might indeed be some truth to it. However, unfortunately, from the current situation, if it weren't for the help of our Wanjie Alliance, your Empire probably wouldn't last till that day." Soon after regaining his senses, Xu Bai still slightly mocked.</p><p></p><p>"Although we might be distant relatives, I would really like to help you. But the right to use the Tianxuan Treasure Mirror, the supreme treasure, is not something I alone can decide. Without showing some sincerity, it's difficult for me as well." He shrugged, looking helpless.</p><p></p><p>The Empress nodded slightly, indicating her understanding.</p><p></p><p>She then flew forward and said, "Follow me."</p><p></p><p>After flying for a while in the Imperial Treasury, she stopped in front of a mechanical device.</p><p></p><p>The device consisted of several different rotating rings, with numbers vaguely changing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>"This is the culmination of the efforts of the thirteenth generation Emperor, the 'Space-Time Spatial Positioning Instrument.' " The Empress introduced it to Xu Bai with a hint of nostalgia in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"During spatial navigation, it can record and save data of the surrounding space. And according to the set target, it can establish a route, preventing us from getting lost in space. At the same time, it can mark the coordinates of passing locations..."</p><p></p><p>"It's somewhat useful, but not very applicable." Xu Bai interrupted the Empress, "Currently, our main pressure is how to survive the first wave of cleansing by the Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>The Empress nodded in understanding, then led Xu Bai to a round pearl.</p><p></p><p>"What's this?" Xu Bai squinted slightly.</p><p></p><p>From this pearl, he could sense both spiritual energy and the aura of a demon beast.</p>

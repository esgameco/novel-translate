            <p>"This move is truly extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>The power of the five heavenly beings would indeed soon be restored. New69 Book28shux.com.</p><p></p><p>By then, in front of the Eternal Life Realm, all the advantages that had been established would be destroyed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>But if, before that, all the members of the Five Elders Council were taken away...</p><p></p><p>What would be left for the five heavenly beings would be a vast empty land.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan knew little about the Eternal Life Realm, he was certain that even the most common cultivators would be useful to the five heavenly beings.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps reducing some would not have much effect.</p><p></p><p>But if he could control the realm, if cultivators and even mortals were all wiped out...</p><p></p><p>It would definitely be a major blow to them.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Five Elders Council of this world is really going to be defeated like this?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but think so.</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, the battle proceeded smoothly.</p><p></p><p>The balance of victory kept shifting towards the Wuxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>However, being an entity that had been passed down for thousands of years, when the Five Elders Council was about to be pushed to the brink, they finally erupted with a powerful resistance.</p><p></p><p>The image in the Tianxuan Mirror suddenly switched to a spot in the sky.</p><p></p><p>From the elliptical shaped Modu Gate, a group of cultivators flew out together.</p><p></p><p>They were obviously not from the Wuxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But their dressing style was also different from the present Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>On their clothes, the same mysterious patterns were embroided. New69 Book28shux.com.</p><p></p><p>These cultivators, looking at the neat rows of black-clad soldiers not far away, showed excited smiles on their faces, eager for the challenge.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the Supreme Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked at the somewhat familiar sect emblem and furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>The image in the Tianxuan Mirror changed again.</p><p></p><p>One after another, gates appeared, and those many ancient sects that were said to have been wiped out long ago were now reappearing on the scene and joining the battle.</p><p></p><p>Not only that.</p><p></p><p>The image in the Tianxuan Mirror focused once more, recording an incredible scene.</p><p></p><p>A slender woman in a white tight-fitting outfit, her figure graceful, was seen somewhere unknown.</p><p></p><p>She was facing a closed golden door with an ancient and sacred aura in the void ahead, bowing slowly.</p><p></p><p>Then the door opened with a loud bang, casting a dazzling golden light.</p><p></p><p>As the light faded, more than ten figures identical to the white-clad woman appeared in the mirror.</p><p></p><p>Their appearances were exactly the same, with only slight differences in age and strength.</p><p></p><p>As if...</p><p></p><p>Different ages of the white-clad woman.</p><p></p><p>Without saying a word, these white-clad women dashed towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"The Sect's Armory?" A flash of insight gleamed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The information he had previously gathered about the Sect's Armory flooded his mind. New69 Book28shux.com.</p><p></p><p>The Sect's Armory was a place similar to the Tianxuan Mirror for the Wuxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>There, various techniques, scriptures, and treasures from the ancient immortal sects, which were as numerous as the sea, could be exchanged freely by cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The required resource was not contribution points but soul points.</p><p></p><p>In the Sect's Armory, there were also realistic illusions of many ancient sects from the ancient times.</p><p></p><p>These illusions were created by a power extremely similar to the Meteor Heaven Realm. In there, Wuxian Alliance cultivators could explore many ancient sects that had already perished. Inside the sects, there were many images of ancient cultivators. Most of them had no consciousness and were just empty shells. However, in combat, their power, displayed in their every move, was almost indistinguishable from real people.</p><p></p><p>Wuxian Alliance cultivators could consume soul points to spar continuously with these ancient cultivators, enhancing their combat abilities. And within the [Sect's Armory], all injuries would not affect the physical body in reality, only causing minor injuries to the soul. The amazing thing was that these soul injuries could also be healed by consuming soul points.</p><p></p><p>In theory, with enough soul points, even a mortal who had just started practicing could become extremely powerful in each battle.</p><p></p><p>"Those called out are the projections of oneself left in the Sect's Armory by consuming soul points?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan instantly understood the origins of these cultivators who appeared like duplicates.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that Li Fan's speculations were not wrong.</p><p></p><p>Similar scenes were happening all over the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, these cultivators who could leave their images in the Sect's Armory were all experienced veterans.</p><p></p><p>With their rich battle experience, their appearance caused great damage to the Wuxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>And it seemed that as long as their true selves didn't die, after resting for a while, they could consume soul power to summon their projections again from the Sect's Armory.</p><p></p><p>It was almost like having unlimited resurrection.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the numerical advantage of the black-clad Wuxian Alliance cultivators was offset.</p><p></p><p>The Alliance's offensive slowed down.</p><p></p><p>And shortly after the stalemate, another force joined the battle.</p><p></p><p>The image in the Tianxuan Mirror changed again.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly disturbed by something, the displayed image in the mirror became a bit blurry.</p><p></p><p>It was like a continuous city built in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators in the city were all asleep.</p><p></p><p>With a slight tremor, they all woke up.</p><p></p><p>Not waking up suddenly after a long sleep, they all had an annoyed expression on their faces as if disturbed from a good dream.</p><p></p><p>They kept mumbling, and their clothes transformed into metallic liquid-like battle armor that covered them entirely.</p><p></p><p>Then, they flew towards the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The image in the Tianxuan Mirror suddenly switched again.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be forced to interrupt.</p><p></p><p>"Is that... the Land of Tranquil Bliss?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was somewhat dazed: "The Land of Tranquil Bliss is the most mysterious place in the territory of the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>It is a dreamland for all cultivators and only those who pass the test can enter.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, once one goes to the Land of Tranquil Bliss, there is rarely a return.</p><p></p><p>In that brief glance earlier, Li Fan also saw many interesting things in that heavenly illusionary city.</p><p></p><p>Such as high-rise buildings and neon lights resembling modern cities.</p><p></p><p>Such as sky roads connecting various buildings like rainbows.</p><p></p><p>Such as shuttles moving and flying around the city.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The power of Tranquil Bliss covers almost the entire Xuanhuang Realm. The Tranquil Bliss Heavenly Venerable should be the strongest among the five."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>It was similar to the scenes of the future cultivation world that Li Fan had seen in the era he was from.</p><p></p><p>"If possible, I can explore that place with my doppelganger."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a feeling that he could find something interesting in the Land of Tranquil Bliss.</p><p></p><p>The joining of the cultivators from the Land of Tranquil Bliss completely turned the tide of the battle.</p><p></p><p>Though their cultivation levels were not impressive, the artifacts they possessed were truly formidable.</p><p></p><p>The metallic armor could absorb almost all attacks and then rebound them.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, each cultivator carried energy beams that seemed almost endless.</p><p></p><p>With a single thought, the energy beams unfolded behind them, then they started bombarding the Wuxian Alliance cultivators relentlessly.</p>

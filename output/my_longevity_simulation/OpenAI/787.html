        <div class="content">
            <p>His gaze continued to play on the replica of the Hua Dao stone mother in Xu Bai's hands, and when Xu Bai finally put it away, he couldn't help but feel a little regretful. </p><p></p><p>He then curiously asked, "But how did you realize that the attraction of the Immortal Realm is indeed increasing?" </p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai did not hide it and explained, "Based on the deviation in the trajectory and angle of movement of the Medicine King's True Cauldron after it flew out of the Xuanhuang Realm." </p><p></p><p>"I mentioned before that over the years, we have also sent people to explore the Immortal Realm. Although we found nothing inside the Immortal Realm, we did record quite a bit of useful information." </p><p></p><p>"According to our calculations, the attraction of the Immortal Realm now is almost double what the Medicine King's True Cauldron encountered initially." </p><p></p><p>"It's quite frightening. Doesn't that mean that in some time, the entire Xuanhuang Realm will be engulfed by it?" Fang Zaiji exclaimed with amazement, showing no signs of fear on his face. </p><p></p><p>"What are those so-called Eternal Heavenly Sovereigns up to anyway?" </p><p></p><p>"Well, if the sky falls, those tall ones will hold it up." He muttered under his breath. </p><p></p><p>"Hoping on others is not something a wise person would do," Chen Tianhai disagreed with his attitude. </p><p></p><p>Upon learning from the replica of the Hua Dao Taiyan Sect that the attraction of the Immortal Realm is indeed increasing, Xu Bai also seemed pensive. </p><p></p><p>"After the discovery of the Immortal Realm back then, the major forces of the Xuanhuang Realm did not choose to escape immediately, but chose to capture other caves and small worlds to confront it instead..." </p><p></p><p>"Perhaps because the Immortal Realm back then was not as terrifying as it is today." </p><p></p><p>"And next, there isn't much time left for the Xuanhuang Realm. So, after the unification of the Xuanhuang in the previous life, they immediately began the expulsion plan." </p><p></p><p>His thoughts fleeting, Xu Bai raised the final question of this meeting, "The cultivators in the city, are they all transformed disciples of the Taiyan Sect over the years? However, I've heard that the Hua Dao Stone Mother itself has gained sentience. I wonder, has it created a human body for itself?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai was a bit surprised by this question, which seemed unrelated to the previous topics. </p><p></p><p>But it wasn't a secret, so he nodded and said, "Initially, out of curiosity about humans, the Hua Dao Stone Mother did indeed create a human body for itself for analysis and research." </p><p></p><p>"However, she rarely appears in human form now." </p><p></p><p>Satisfied with the answer, Xu Bai nodded slightly. </p><p></p><p>After that, he bid farewell to Chen Tianhai. </p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a while, Chen Tianhai ultimately let Xu Bai and the others leave. </p><p></p><p>As Xu Bai and Fang Zaiji disappeared into the Taixuan Cave Heaven. </p><p></p><p>A figure with an unclear appearance, entirely blue, suddenly appeared next to Chen Tianhai.</p><p></p><p>"You let them go like that?" </p><p></p><p>"That Xu Bai, perhaps carries many secrets." </p><p></p><p>"Outside of the variables, perhaps brought back from outside by the Medicine King Sect. Or maybe from those existences deliberately erased by the powerful." The voice of the blue figure sounded neither male nor female, its tone fluctuating strangely, but it did not hinder her communication with Chen Tianhai. </p><p></p><p>"Deliberately erased? Are you saying that the powerful can be resurrected?" Chen Tianhai's eyes flashed with light. </p><p></p><p>"From the deduction results, it is highly possible. The appearance of Xu Bai, never seen in any of the worlds we deduced. His birth may be purely coincidental. But Fang Zaiji referred to him as the Sect Master..." </p><p></p><p>"So it indicates that we are missing some information, leading to erroneous deduction results." The blue figure spoke rapidly, explaining. </p><p></p><p>"Involving too many unknown factors, it is too risky to bring him into the Taiyan Sect recklessly." </p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Chen Tianhai slowly nodded. </p><p></p><p>"What did his last question mean?" </p><p></p><p>The rippling blue figure hesitated for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, she replied, "Deduction failed." </p><p></p><p>"But..." </p><p></p><p>She didn't finish the sentence, her figure gradually becoming indistinct, disappearing in front of Chen Tianhai. </p><p></p><p>However, Chen Tianhai seemed to have heard the words left unsaid by the blue figure. </p><p></p><p>He showed an interested expression. </p><p></p><p>In Chang Valley. </p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji was narrating the experiences of this trip to Liu San and Jiang Yushan. </p><p></p><p>"I never expected that the esteemed Taiyan Sect would end up in such a ghostly state. Compared to that, our Medicine King Sect seems somewhat fortunate." Fang Zaiji sighed repeatedly. </p><p></p><p>Apparently, no matter how Chen Tianhai bragged, he couldn't accept the so-called "Information Immortality." </p><p></p><p>Liu San also wore a look of lamentation. </p><p></p><p>Scanning the daily practice of the disciples in the Changsheng Valley, a rich scene of vitality, his expression changed frequently, showing his contemplation. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Bai had already arrived in the secret room. </p><p></p><p>The dazzling white replica of the Hua Dao Stone Mother was suspended in front of him. </p><p></p><p>"Simulation..." </p><p></p><p>Xu Bai sneered, but did not make contact with it using his spiritual knowledge to perform the so-called simulation operation. </p><p></p><p>In the Taiyan Sect, lies could not be accommodated. Xu Bai didn't believe it at all. </p><p></p><p>Master Li was naturally suspicious, especially after acquiring the treasure called "Huanzhen." He would not easily trust anyone. </p><p></p><p>"Once you use it for simulation, either you immediately reveal the truth, or you use it at a life-or-death moment when necessary." </p><p></p><p>"Anyway, if you want to use it, you have to be prepared for the leaking of the truth." </p><p></p><p>Xu Bai stared at it for a long time, then decided to put it away for now. </p><p></p><p>"According to Chen Tianhai's explanation, although hundreds of years passed in the simulation, only a moment has actually gone by in reality." </p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it can be used to find a way out in a critical moment." </p><p></p><p>"Just hoping that I never have to use it in this lifetime." </p><p></p><p>Suppressing his thoughts for now, Xu Bai solemnly did something. </p><p></p><p>He wrote a letter. </p><p></p><p>Preparations should be made before the battle. In this world full of crises, despite Li Fan making many preparations, there was no certainty of victory. </p><p></p><p>If... </p><p></p><p>Just if, he could not escape the influence of Mr. Bai's resurrection. </p><p></p><p>In the end, if he perished, being replaced by Mr. Bai, how could Li Fan accept it? </p><p></p><p>"If I die, the strange stuff called 'Huanzhen' will be spread all over the world." </p><p></p><p>"If you want to take my place? Even if I die, you won't have an easy time!" </p><p></p><p>A touch of gloom flashed across Xu Bai's face. </p><p></p><p>It can be imagined that if the cultivators of the Xuanhuang Realm knew that there is still such a strange object as "Huanzhen" in the world. </p><p></p><p>Even if its next owner is as powerful as an Eternal Heavenly Sovereign, they will never have peace in the future. </p><p></p><p>This is Li Fan's last resort. </p><p></p><p>It will only be activated when Li Fan's consciousness is completely annihilated.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 910</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Just in that year when Li Fan was patiently waiting for changes in the world of Xuanyellow, and for his clone to successfully take away the Black Sword.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, something happened that he had never experienced in his previous cycles of reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>On that day, Tianyang, who was lying idle in the Spirit Wood Realm, suddenly got up.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards a certain direction in the Xuanyellow Realm, his expression serious.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang's unusual behavior immediately raised Li Fan's alertness.</p><p></p><p>He knew the temperament of this junior brother, who was indifferent to almost everything except himself and his senior brother.</p><p></p><p>For him to look so serious now, things must not be simple.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, what's wrong?" Li Fan flashed over to Tianyang and casually asked.</p><p></p><p>"I felt a very strong spatial fluctuation descending upon the Xuanyellow Realm. It was fleeting, and I couldn't pinpoint the location." </p><p></p><p>"But it definitely won't be wrong," Tianyang spoke more fluently as he continued, getting straight to the point.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan's heart skipped a beat, "A very strong spatial fluctuation? What does that mean?"</p><p></p><p>"If it was simply a spatial transmission within the Xuanyellow Realm, it wouldn't emit such a strong wave. This means that the Xuanyellow Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"Has an outsider arrived?" Li Fan continued.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression also turned extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>"To think that there are still other cultivators alive in this deepest star sea?"</p><p></p><p>"Or could it be that this person comes from beyond the High Wall?" </p><p></p><p>Numerous thoughts flashed through Li Fan's mind. </p><p></p><p>His emotions surged, and even with his composure, he couldn’t calm down for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the arrival of an outsider being too shocking, the more crucial reason was that this event seemed to have never occurred in his past cycles of reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>What caused the unexpected appearance of an outsider?</p><p></p><p>"There might be another possibility."</p><p></p><p>A sudden idea popped in Li Fan's mind, "This matter occurred in previous lives, but with my power back then, I couldn’t sense it."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Li Fan finally calmed down.</p><p></p><p>With such a huge commotion, the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders must have also noticed.</p><p></p><p>Let's see how they react.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, you've been working hard recently. See if you can try to track that spatial fluctuation," Li Fan instructed.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>As it turned out, the arrival of the outsider was not known to the general public.</p><p></p><p>But for the apparent rulers of the Xuanyellow Realm, it indeed had a significant impact.</p><p></p><p>The most obvious change was that the previously tense situation suddenly eased without any explanation.</p><p></p><p>For over thirty days, the Wanxian Alliance’s Heavenly Venerable and the Five Elders did not appear again.</p><p></p><p>The situation at the Five Elders' side was unusually quiet as well.</p><p></p><p>This scenario seemed like both sides had stopped their activities and were focusing on something else.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also sent a message to the Five Elders, inquiring about the strong spatial fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving a confirmed response from the Five Elders, they informed him that they were investigating the cause of the spatial fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>They also mentioned that if the Wanjie Cooperative discovered anything, they should notify them as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"This seriousness is too rare." Li Fan stroked his chin, his brows slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Most crucially, the Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders have been searching together for so many days. Yet they still haven't found this outsider?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt uneasy.</p><p></p><p>After pacing back and forth for a while, he finally made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>He headed to the old dilapidated temple in Yongyun Prefecture and stood before Senior Shi Ban.</p><p></p><p>"Are you talking about the recent fluctuation?" Senior Shi Ban, seeming to have truly comprehended the Dao of fishing, had a mysterious aura about him. Like the tide, his aura rose and fell, emanating a daunting effect on those around him.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's current strength, whenever he tried to approach, he would be forcefully pushed back by this unintentionally emitted power. Li Fan couldn’t help but feel shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes. The intensity of the spatial fluctuation clearly exceeded the specifications of internal spatial transmission in the Xuanyellow Realm. If it's an outsider, I fear..." Li Fan spoke with concern.</p><p></p><p>"The Wanxian Alliance and the Five Elders have been searching for so long without any results. So, for the safety of the Xuanyellow Realm, I can only seek help from Senior Shi Ban," Li Fan said.</p><p></p><p>Senior Shi Ban remained silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Yet it wasn’t that he didn’t want to answer, but more as if he had fallen asleep.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, this is a misunderstanding. There is no outsider..."</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, if you truly want to know the ins and outs of this matter, go find this person." Senior Shi Ban pointed towards Li Fan lightly.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, corresponding information emerged in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Senior Shi Ban returned to his contemplation of the Dao of fishing. Li Fan bowed respectfully before leaving.</p><p></p><p>"The Qinghuang Prefecture, Han Zhong?"</p><p></p><p>Reading the information sent by Senior Shi Ban, Li Fan frowned involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>He had visited the Qinghuang Prefecture before.</p><p></p><p>Located in the southwest corner of the Wanxian Alliance, it was desolate and remote, sparsely populated.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Cloud Cluster Sea, it was even more backward, being the most remote area in the entire Wanxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that precisely because of this, it's more suitable for hiding?"</p><p></p><p>With such thoughts in mind, Li Fan transformed into a streak of light and headed towards the Qinghuang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>After some effort, when he arrived at his destination and stood in front of Han Zhong's residence.</p><p></p><p>Before he could enter, Li Fan caught a whiff of alcohol.</p><p></p><p>"Why doesn't anyone believe me?"</p><p></p><p>"Good wine!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, none of it's real, it's all just a dream! *Burp*"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's brow furrowed even more.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the room, he saw a cultivator with unkempt beard and ragged clothes, lying on the floor with no dignity.</p><p></p><p>He tightly gripped a wine jug in his hand, his expression dazed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan coldly asked, "Are you Han Zhong?"</p><p></p><p>Han Zhong glanced at Li Fan somewhat confusedly, remained silent for a while, and then as if he hadn't seen Li Fan, went back to drinking from his jug.</p><p></p><p>With a snort, Li Fan was about to use the Soul Search Technique to extract the secrets from this man's drunken mind.</p><p></p><p>However, just as Li Fan's right hand was about to reach Han Zhong's head.</p><p></p><p>As if burned by fire, Li Fan instantly retracted his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared at his palm, somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Although his outward physical body seemed unaffected, Li Fan keenly sensed that the moment his soul touched the other person, it decayed!</p><p></p><p>Not injured, but as if his soul was depleted, akin to a cultivator on the verge of death, with a withered spirit!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn’t help but be shaken.</p><p></p><p>He was aware that his soul's strength at this moment, even among the Integrated Dao cultivators, was almost unparalleled.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 828</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"The rise of a great power can be supported solely by this Wood-attribute cave sky. Not to mention, there are four other attribute cave skies."</p><p></p><p>Arriving early in the Xuanhuang realm, Li Fan intercepted the whereabouts discovered by the Wanxian Alliance, feeling very pleased with himself.</p><p></p><p>After roughly strolling around, he then successively headed towards the Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water attribute cave skies.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had stayed in the Water-attribute cave sky for a long time before.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Li Fan realized that what he had seen back then was almost the scenery that had been emptied out.</p><p></p><p>Unlike now, under the vibrant sea, numerous fish reproduce and thrive.</p><p></p><p>Countless Water-attribute spiritual herbs and mines filled the entire sea area.</p><p></p><p>Even the well-traveled Li Fan couldn't help but marvel.</p><p></p><p>The Metal-attribute cave sky was a vast and boundless underground world. It was dotted with various rare mineral veins and metal life forms.</p><p></p><p>The Fire-attribute cave sky was not much different from the fiery world behind Dali's back. However, it was not as violent.</p><p></p><p>And the Earth-attribute world was a continuous mountainous scene.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After taking a casual stroll, while feeling content, a question arose in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>That was how vast these Five Element cave skies were.</p><p></p><p>If one wanted to cultivate the Golden Core cultivation base, devouring it to achieve the Nascent Soul realm, it would probably be nearly impossible within three to five years.</p><p></p><p>This was still without anyone discovering it and without being disturbed.</p><p></p><p>And on the premise that the Five Element cave skies themselves would not resist.</p><p></p><p>In fact, when the scale reached the level of the Five Element cave skies, although it was not yet part of the level of a "Small World," it was almost no different from a "world."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan distinctly remembered that when they wanted to set up the "Heavenly Mystery Locking Spirit Array" to cover all the cave skies again.</p><p></p><p>They faced fierce resistance from the cave sky consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Countless extremely cunning and endless monsters were created to launch attacks.</p><p></p><p>Even with Lin Ling guarding them, they might not be able to handle it.</p><p></p><p>"The appetite is too big, which is also a problem." Li Fan couldn't help but furrow his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>Although it was challenging, Li Fan would absolutely not give up on these Five Element cave skies.</p><p></p><p>His own cultivation base was irrelevant.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial thing was not letting the Wanxian Alliance get it.</p><p></p><p>To prevent unnecessary variables in the situation.</p><p></p><p>"While my Golden Core is not yet complete, I need to think of a way during this time. If it remains impossible, I'll have to rely on water grinding techniques."</p><p></p><p>He stayed in the Five Element cave skies for a few more days.</p><p></p><p>It was close to the time agreed with the Five Elders when Li Fan finally left.</p><p></p><p>"If there are two allies from the He Dao Sect, we can try to transfer the entrance of the Five Element cave skies. But if there is too much commotion, there might be a risk of being discovered by the Wanxian Alliance." Li Fan thought so before he left, concealing the entrance again.</p><p></p><p>Still relying on Lin Ling, they shuttled through the veins.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the three of them returned to Jiushan Prefecture without a sound.</p><p></p><p>When leaving the veins, Li Fan even felt, surprisingly, a sense of "reluctance" coming from Tianyang, which was very rare.</p><p></p><p>"Tianyang used the 'Earthfire Returning to Origin Array' to create a puppet body, it seems that the power of the veins is somewhat special for him."</p><p></p><p>"Let Lin Ling take him around more. The power of the veins in the Xuanhuang realm is immense, and the Vein Ancient Tree probably won't mind."</p><p></p><p>Thinking so, Li Fan instructed Lin Ling in this way.</p><p></p><p>At another location, Li Fan once again crushed a jade charm, releasing a fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, Yu Dayi hurried over.</p><p></p><p>This time, without making a fuss, there was only one other person with him.</p><p></p><p>And at the sight of the other person, Li Fan's heart immediately rang alarm bells.</p><p></p><p>Although they had not met before, Li Fan felt a very familiar aura from the other person!</p><p></p><p>The answer was almost about to come out: the other person was a member of the "United Hearts" Zhao Master Sister!</p><p></p><p>But at this time, Zhao Master Sister did not come in her female form; instead, she appeared as a handsome young man of only fifteen or sixteen years old.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the fellow Daoist from the 'World United Association'?" He looked at Li Fan and asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart trembled, but he remained calm despite the surprise.</p><p></p><p>With Zhao Master Sister having many bodies, the one in front of him was just a Divine Transformation cultivation.</p><p></p><p>And even the Patriarch of Transmission could not know everything.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan was not worried that his secrets would be discovered at a glance.</p><p></p><p>After gathering his thoughts and thinking for a moment, Li Fan squinted his eyes and chose "General" directly.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, to actually attract the Patriarch personally, it is indeed so honorable!" He showed a strange smile and stared at Zhao Master Sister.</p><p></p><p>The smile on the young man's face froze instantly.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that he truly looked seriously at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Yu Dayi seemed unaware of the true identity of the cultivator beside him. After hearing Li Fan's words, he was slightly stunned and bewildered for a moment, but being a native cultivator of the Five Elders Association, he quickly reacted.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly turned his head, looking at the young man with a somewhat playful smile, his expression freezing.</p><p></p><p>His body also couldn't help but tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I've been seen through."</p><p></p><p>"It's quite amusing. It seems like your 'World United Association' does have some skills."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if you would welcome me to join?"</p><p></p><p>The young man smiled lightly.</p><p></p><p>Though his tone was like that of a charming woman, full of allure, it should have been bone-chilling, but Li Fan did not feel uncomfortable hearing it.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I actually wanted to join the Patriarch's Daoist Sect as well."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quickly and unceremoniously countered.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Master Sister was not angry but rather smiled sweetly, saying, "If we cooperate, it's not impossible..."</p><p></p><p>Yu Dayi, on the side, was sweating coldly and feeling weak in the legs.</p><p></p><p>He regretted not being deaf and not hearing such taboo conversations between Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he had already categorized the "World United Association" and Li Fan as the most untouchable in his mind.</p><p></p><p>With a forced smile, Li Fan avoided answering.</p><p></p><p>But then, he changed the subject and asked about serious matters, "What do we need?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Master Sister threw a piece of "Void Spirit Stone Mother" over.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan skillfully caught and inspected it, finding it exactly as described in the list he provided.</p><p></p><p>He put it away.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you afraid I might tamper with it?" Zhao Master Sister suddenly said in a deep tone.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Zhao, you act righteously; you're not someone who would do such things." Li Fan replied in this manner.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Zhao Master Sister's expression completely changed.</p><p></p><p>"Since Sister personally appeared, I'll provide you with a top-secret piece of information for free."</p><p></p><p>"The Wise Verdant Leaf can be used to create a Divine Ship that can shuttle through the white mist, eliminating the side effects of devouring the Origin White Mist."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan transmitted.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for a response, a green light enveloped him, and he disappeared on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Yu Dayi dared not move.</p><p></p><p>"A girl's thoughts are really hard to guess."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 918</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Only to see Wan Zailai and Pei Qingshan, who were trapped together, were already fighting at one place.</p><p></p><p>Pei Qingshan showed no mercy and directly manifested a green wood paradise, intending to suppress Wan Zailai.</p><p></p><p>Wan Zailai, however, remained calm and fearless. In a flash, his figure split into two, and those two into eight...</p><p></p><p>When the green wood paradise fully manifested, in the arena, there were already tens of thousands of Wan Zailai's figures.</p><p></p><p>"Wan Jian Returning to Origin!"</p><p></p><p>With a loud shout, Wan Zailai's numerous avatars had solemn expressions, all transforming into swords heading towards the green wood paradise.</p><p></p><p>The sword light was like a rain, bursting out with dazzling radiance.</p><p></p><p>Even the sun in the sky seemed dim at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Pei Qingshan's body, in an instant, turned into ashes amidst the countless sword lights.</p><p></p><p>Before he could generate his body again, the newly born flesh and blood were annihilated by the sword lights again.</p><p></p><p>The sword momentum was endless, seeming to have no end.</p><p></p><p>Under the pressure of the sword lights, the green wood paradise kept trembling, on the verge of complete collapse.</p><p></p><p>"Surrender! I surrender!"</p><p></p><p>Pei Qingshan's panicked voice resounded through the sky.</p><p></p><p>A white light flashed, and he withdrew from the arena.</p><p></p><p>His figure looked a bit disheveled, and his expression, unlike his previous fury, was now filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>"You win!" Wan Zailai sheathed his sword, his numerous avatars returning to one.</p><p></p><p>Hovering in the sky, he looked down at the Yilv State cultivators below, his white robe fluttering in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Pei Qingshan's defeat came so swiftly that it was unexpected by everyone. And Wan Zailai's endless sword lights were indeed terrifying.</p><p></p><p>They were still trying to recover from the intense suffocation and pressure they felt just now, without even being able to blame Pei Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>The scene fell into a dead silence.</p><p></p><p>"Anyone who disagrees can step forward!"</p><p></p><p>"I, Wan Zailai, will block it with one sword!"</p><p></p><p>The arrogant voice of the white-clad handsome youth echoed over the Yilv City.</p><p></p><p>Under his imposing aura, for a moment, no cultivator dared to step forward to battle. After all, everyone knew Pei Qingshan's strength, and even at the peak of the Yuanying stage, it was impossible to defeat him as easily as Wan Zailai did.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps only a Nascent Soul cultivator can subdue him."</p><p></p><p>This thought flashed through the minds of the cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>But Yilv State's Nascent Soul cultivators were either in the One Mind Immortal Sect or at the front lines. Even if they were present, they might not necessarily challenge Wan Zailai.</p><p></p><p>A Nascent Soul against a Golden Core...</p><p></p><p>It was already beyond describing it as bullying. No Nascent Soul cultivator would lower their dignity to participate in such dishonorable acts.</p><p></p><p>And if they were to lose...</p><p></p><p>They would likely become the laughingstock of the entire Wu Lao Assembly, becoming the stepping stone for Wan Zailai's complete fame.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present had different thoughts, silent and contemplative.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, they just let the white-clad youth display his power above.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Yilv State is indeed devoid of talent!"</p><p></p><p>The disdainful voice of Wan Zailai sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, better not be too arrogant."</p><p></p><p>Just then, a cold voice suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, it drew the attention of all the cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>It was a cultivator of exquisite beauty, neither male nor female, slowly flying into the air.</p><p></p><p>"I am Li Qing!"</p><p></p><p>He arched his hand, then was led by white light to the arena.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Wan Zailai squinted.</p><p></p><p>Accustomed to being proud, he was naturally displeased being reprimanded by a younger person who appeared to be younger than him.</p><p></p><p>"I won't use the power of the paradise. With just one hand at the Golden Core stage, I can suppress you!" Unexpectedly, Li Qing shook his hand, speaking with the most audacious tone, with a serious expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>This time, it was not only Wan Zailai who changed color.</p><p></p><p>Even the Yilv State cultivators watching below were amazed.</p><p></p><p>"I thought Wan Zailai was already arrogant. I didn't expect Li Qing to be even more arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>"This Brother Li seems a bit unfamiliar. Is he one of our Yilv State cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, why else would he come forward? Yilv State is vast and diverse, this person should be a hidden talent in the countryside!"</p><p></p><p>…</p><p></p><p>The crowd was abuzz with discussions.</p><p></p><p>Wan Zailai let out a deep chuckle, "Very well. I can't wait to see you being dismembered by ten thousand swords."</p><p></p><p>Before his words fell, he unleashed his most powerful move.</p><p></p><p>"Ten Thousand Swords Decision!"</p><p></p><p>Similar to his previous move, in the arena, tens of thousands of avatars appeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>However, unlike the Wan Sword Returning to Origin, this time, it was not just simple sword strikes, but each avatar used a different sword technique.</p><p></p><p>The sky was illuminated by colorful sword lights.</p><p></p><p>Countless different-shaped sword shadows emerged one after another.</p><p></p><p>Then, emitting sword cries resembling dragon roars, all the swords attacked Li Qing together.</p><p></p><p>The sword lights tore through space, causing endless vibrations. Even the transparent arena that restrained them showed slight cracks.</p><p></p><p>Facing this grand scene, the Yilv State cultivators below widened their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"So this is Wan Zailai's true strength?"</p><p></p><p>"So powerful! Probably even Nascent Soul cultivators would taste defeat under this move!"</p><p></p><p>"What is Wan Zailai's background? He's so strong at the Golden Core stage. What if he breaks through to the Yuanying stage?"</p><p></p><p>…</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone present sighed deeply in amazement.</p><p></p><p>But before they could lament, amid the endless sword cries, a firm and powerful chant rang out:</p><p></p><p>"Even if facing a myriad of sword decisions..."</p><p></p><p>"You must bow your head before me!"</p><p></p><p>The voice was not loud.</p><p></p><p>Yet it completely suppressed all the sword cries.</p><p></p><p>In a flash of lightning, in the sky above the arena, a scene occurred that left all the cultivators present dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Countless sword techniques resembling dragons and swirling towards Li Qing were forced to slow down just before hitting him.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, in front of Li Qing, they all came to a halt.</p><p></p><p>Numerous different sword shadows trembled slightly, lowering their sword tips!</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing lightly commanded.</p><p></p><p>The myriad sword shadows turned around and changed direction.</p><p></p><p>They returned, attacking Wan Zailai, who stood there in disbelief and confusion, still not understanding what was happening!</p><p></p><p>As Wan Zailai was about to be dismembered by Li Qing's ultimate move, a white light surged, and the next moment, his figure disappeared from the arena.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the ground, but by now, no one paid him any mind.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 834</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>A dazzling yellow light enveloped an area of tens of thousands of meters in diameter.</p><p></p><p>The affected cultivators all reverted back to the state before surrounding Oushangtian.</p><p></p><p>By the time they realized it, Oushangtian and his son had already disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>In their haste, they continued to chase but found only Oushangtian remaining in flight.</p><p></p><p>After resisting for a while, it was ultimately a lucky individual named Xie Xiantao who captured him.</p><p></p><p>Facing the greedy gazes of the other cultivators, Xie Xiantao made a wise decision promptly.</p><p></p><p>He handed Oushangtian over to the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance in exchange for a reward.</p><p></p><p>In fact, during his escape, Oushangtian had killed no less than a hundred cultivators from the Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Although it was in self-defense, it still violated the laws of the Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Oushangtian had long been a repeat offender within the Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Officially there had been no consequences before, but that didn't mean the matter was not being monitored.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, when Xie Xiantao openly declared his choice, in just a moment, a group of black-clad cultivators arrived at the scene and took him and the barely alive Oushangtian away.</p><p></p><p>The uproar of the grand pursuit event came to a close.</p><p></p><p>As for another protagonist of the event, Oushangtian's father, Oudaozi, no one cared about him anymore.</p><p></p><p>Except for Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>In a dark forest in Luo Yanzhou.</p><p></p><p>Oudaozi hid under layers of dried leaves, severely wounded. </p><p></p><p>But the thought of his son sacrificing himself to protect him, exhausting his own abilities and diverting the enemies, tore at him, causing immense pain.</p><p></p><p>"The Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>Oudaozi's eyes were bloodshot, and the faces of those who had participated in the pursuit flashed in his mind repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>His heart was filled with resentment.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, he dared not move, afraid of being discovered.</p><p></p><p>He silently rested and recovered from his injuries.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a sigh came from somewhere.</p><p></p><p>Oudaozi was startled, wanting to escape, but it was already too late.</p><p></p><p>Three familiar figures, who knows when, had already appeared by his side.</p><p></p><p>"It's you!" Oudaozi glared at Li Fan, the mastermind of all the troubles, his eyes filled with fury.</p><p></p><p>He was about to explode on the spot and face the end together with Li Fan, but was suppressed by Lin Ling and Tian Yang joining hands.</p><p></p><p>Already at a disadvantage in terms of strength, now extremely injured and having lost most of his power, it didn't take long for him to be completely restrained.</p><p></p><p>"Weird, why are you looking at me with those eyes?"</p><p></p><p>"I just wanted to ask for your help in designing buildings. Before you and your son even met us, you fled in a hurry and even schemed to take my life. If it wasn't for my good fortune, I might have perished right then and there."</p><p></p><p>"I haven't settled the score with you yet."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, all those who pursued and captured your son were members of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance. What does that have to do with me?" Li Fan said innocently.</p><p></p><p>"This is outrageous!" Oudaozi, already furious at Li Fan's nonsensical talk, was at his breaking point.</p><p></p><p>Veins bulged on his forehead, pulsating non-stop.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly on the verge of a life-and-death struggle with Li Fan, but he was overwhelmed by Lin Ling and Tian Yang.</p><p></p><p>He had been weak from the start, and now, severely injured and weakened, lost most of his combat capabilities.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he was completely under control.</p><p></p><p>"It's a misunderstanding that has led to my son and me being unable to meet again..."</p><p></p><p>"There will always be a chance. Friend, look how do you like my Lingmu Realm?" Li Fan changed the subject, pointing to the small world that was being constructed fervently.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk...," Oudaozi observed for a while, shook his head repeatedly, a hint of disdain in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't quite match the prestige of the Ten Thousand Realms Union."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, rather than being angry, politely said, "Then I'll trouble you, friend, to make some changes."</p><p></p><p>With a narrowed eye, Oudaozi nodded.</p><p></p><p>Already deeply immersed in this path, Oudaozi quickly became absorbed in his own plans and visions.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, please carry on. If you need anything, just tell the leader of the tree people in this realm."</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's approval, Oudaozi temporarily forgot about his earlier sorrow.</p><p></p><p>He threw himself wholeheartedly into the construction of the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>"After some setbacks, the main goal has been achieved."</p><p></p><p>"The Kunqian Bone Hand, the Ten Thousand Death Book..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>According to Oudaozi, Oushangtian had not fully mastered the abilities of the Kunqian Bone Hand yet.</p><p></p><p>During the escape, he seemed to sense that there were still powerful abilities hidden within, waiting to be explored.</p><p></p><p>If given some more time, he might really be able to achieve some degree of time reversal.</p><p></p><p>However, this was only Oushangtian's speculation.</p><p></p><p>The specifics were still uncertain.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 763</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"My judgment is far better than that old Willow. I never make mistakes. I bet that these little ones are all rare talents in cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"I've traveled through more than a dozen states and only found these few. I know how difficult this journey has been."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji sighed.</p><p></p><p>"You didn't even say hello and just kidnapped these kids, didn't you?" Staring at the crying group of children, San Liu's expression turned unfriendly.</p><p></p><p>"Joke, walking the immortal path, cultivating the path to immortality. Many mortals can't achieve it even if they beg. I kindly guide them. Do I still need their parents' permission?" Fang Zaiji glanced at San Liu and said matter-of-factly.</p><p></p><p>"Besides, our Medicine King Sect is currently in seclusion. We need to be more discreet in our actions."</p><p></p><p>San Liu was speechless after hearing these words.</p><p></p><p>"Since Mr. Fang found them, it means they have a connection with our Medicine King Sect. I believe in Mr. Fang's judgment," Xu Bai cleared his throat and confirmed.</p><p></p><p>"Nowadays, it's not like ancient times when countless sects roamed the world selecting disciples. The Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance rules by non-interference, and whoever embarks on the path of cultivation depends on their own fate. Therefore, there must be a lot of exceptional talents buried in obscurity."</p><p></p><p>"This may be an opportunity for our Medicine King Sect."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, San Liu's eyes also lit up. "The Sect Master is right."</p><p></p><p>"Then, taking care of these disciples will need your help, Mr. Liu. Teach them the methods of cultivation first, and then let them build their foundation..."</p><p></p><p>While Xu Bai was speaking, he suddenly had a flash of inspiration.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, he changed his mind: "When initially informing them of the cultivation method, don't mention the part about 'using the wonders of heaven and earth to build the foundation'."</p><p></p><p>"Instead, just tell them to 'melt their own bodies to build the foundation'!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, both San Liu and Fang Zaiji were slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Both of them were not dull-witted and instantly understood Xu Bai's intention.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful, this way, if one of them succeeds in building the foundation, it will definitely be 'melt their own bodies to build the foundation'!" Fang Zaiji exclaimed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>San Liu, however, had a trace of hesitation on his face. "Sect Master, isn't this a bit..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai smiled faintly, "If they truly cannot build the foundation and have completely given up, there is no harm in telling them the truth then."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Bai's reasoning, San Liu had to nod in agreement.</p><p></p><p>After explaining in detail the details of 'melting their own bodies to build the foundation' that he knew, Xu Bai suddenly asked, "By the way, why didn't I see Elder Jiang?"</p><p></p><p>"I clearly sensed her aura returning."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji immediately teased, "She got into a fight with someone and ended up losing miserably. She got hurt, so she's currently in seclusion trying to recover."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I heard the other party was a woman. If she's prettier than Elder Jiang, it must have been quite an insult. It would be strange if Yushan didn't lose her temper."</p><p></p><p>"We can finally have some peace without hearing her annoying voice." Fang Zaiji looked extremely pleased.</p><p></p><p>San Liu's expression changed slightly, "What, such an important matter, why didn't you mention it earlier, Fang? Is Yushan hurt?"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, San Liu seemed anxious. He put aside the tasks entrusted to him by Xu Bai and quickly flew out to visit Jiang Yushan.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji shrugged, "I don't understand what San Liu sees in that woman."</p><p></p><p>"Since Elder Jiang is in seclusion, I'll leave the task of creating the End-Times Disc to you, Mr. Fang," Xu Bai interrupted at this point.</p><p></p><p>"With your abilities, there shouldn't be any problem, right?" Xu Bai looked at Fang Zaiji with some expectation.</p><p></p><p>Rather than being angry at being assigned a laborious task, Fang Zaiji was delighted and said, "No problem at all! The End-Times Disc is something almost as valuable as an immortal tool. I've always found Elder Jiang's methods a little rough."</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, rest assured, I will treat it very gently."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji looked expectantly at Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>After smiling, Xu Bai tossed the End-Times Disc to Fang Zaiji, entrusting it to him.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for further instructions, Fang Zaiji, with the treasure in hand, joyfully left on his own.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Bai shifted his gaze to the group of children on the square.</p><p></p><p>If it were the original body, he would have found their crying very noisy.</p><p></p><p>But as a clone, Xu Bai didn't feel impatient with the noisy children. Instead, he felt a sense of pity and protection for them.</p><p></p><p>Quietly realizing the source of his feelings, a faint smile appeared on Xu Bai's face as he gently approached the children.</p><p></p><p>With a divine-like appearance and an extremely gentle aura, he instantly caught the attention of all the children present. They all quieted down and looked at Xu Bai together.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai interacted very kindly with the children.</p><p></p><p>In just a short while, he already knew all their names and their respective talents in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"It's no wonder that during ancient times, being hunted by all major sects could still escape every time. This Fang Zaiji indeed has some skills."</p><p></p><p>"The talents of these children are almost on par with Zhang Haobo's."</p><p></p><p>Just like the previous life, the practitioner who first released a long-winded document revealing the true face of the 'Sky Xuan Locking Spirit Array' to the world bore the same name.</p><p></p><p>That long-winded document, tens of thousands of words long and full of passion, appeared in Xu Bai's mind instantaneously.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the five-year-old child in front of him, Xu Bai's and another figure slowly overlapped.</p><p></p><p>"It really is him. Interesting."</p><p></p><p>As a leader of the Overt Heaven Assembly in the previous life, Gu Xinghan led numerous cultivators in a struggle against the Mysterious Web but was never captured by the Heavenly Alliance.</p><p></p><p>His capabilities were beyond doubt.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that this boy might bring me some surprises."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai lightly patted Gu Xinghan's shoulder and his smile became more pronounced.</p><p></p><p>After a while, San Liu returned somewhat dejected.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, he hadn't even seen Jiang Yushan.</p><p></p><p>He had to pull himself together and deal seriously with the group of children.</p><p></p><p>After Xu Bai comforted them earlier, the children behaved much better. When Xu Bai left, they even waved goodbye to him.</p><p></p><p>San Liu was amazed at how well-behaved they had become.</p><p></p><p>Instead of returning to Tianling Prefecture, Xu Bai went to the secret chamber in Changsheng Valley.</p><p></p><p>He was uncertain about a sudden idea that had emerged in his mind and needed time to think it through carefully.</p><p></p><p>"Should I use this body to perform the ritual and enter the Immortal Descent Realm?"</p><p></p><p>This was a thought that popped up in his mind while interacting with the children.</p><p></p><p>Seeing how kind Mr. Bai was to the children, it seemed like he truly was a "good person," just as Xu Ke had said.</p>

            <p>"Could it be that they are really impartial and fair?"</p><p></p><p>A hint of doubt flashed in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>However, judging from his understanding of the Wuxian Alliance, things might not be that simple.</p><p></p><p>"Let's think from a different perspective."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps these so-called thirty-three Immortal Selectees are not a good thing. That's why people from these families deliberately avoided it."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>This speculation coincided with his premonition about Wei Qizheng's outcome.</p><p></p><p>"Thirty-three immortals, the Supreme Daoist of Eternal Life has not yet appeared, definitely counts as a force that can influence the situation."</p><p></p><p>"What does the Wuxian Alliance want to do?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but feel interested.</p><p></p><p>From the information he currently had, it seemed that due to some reasons, the Transmitted Methods had temporarily left the Xuanyellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>They only left behind their Dao Spirits.</p><p></p><p>Only when there is a disturbance or when the Xuanyellow Realm is about to be destroyed, will they hurry back.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, the Wuxian Alliance and the Five Elders' Meeting seemed evenly matched.</p><p></p><p>In reality, without the constraint of the Transmitted Methods' Supreme Daoist, they were at a distinct disadvantage facing the five experts in the Eternal Life Realm from the Five Elders' Meeting.</p><p></p><p>"Just like the 114th generation trying to create the mysterious net to resist the Supreme Daoist of Eternal Life."</p><p></p><p>"This generation's thirty-three Immortal Selectees must be related to 'creating a force that can counteract the experts in the Eternal Life Realm.'" A realization flashed in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Both sides have made their moves, now it depends on how this game will unfold!"</p><p></p><p>Previously, the Five Elders' Meeting had tried to contact him again.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan ignored all of them.</p><p></p><p>The resources obtained from the Five Elders' Meeting were temporarily sufficient.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan decided to observe the situation's development and make plans for the next step.</p><p></p><p>He firmly memorized the information of over three hundred cultivators on the list.</p><p></p><p>Then, Li Fan crushed the list, enveloping his mind once again around the Five Elements Grand Heavenly Cavern.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had successfully reached consummation in the Golden Elixir stage.</p><p></p><p>He officially began the process of devouring the Five Elements Grand Heavenly Cavern.</p><p></p><p>The roots of Heaven and Earth transformed into tentacles, spreading through the intermittent spaces of the heavenly caverns, temporarily lurking in every attribute heavenly cavern.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Grand Heavenly Cavern was indeed vast, requiring the accumulation of strength and growing enough roots of the roots of Heaven and Earth before swallowing the heavenly cavern.</p><p></p><p>There were no shortcuts; only perseverance.</p><p></p><p>The only thing worth noting was that the Five Elements Grand Heavenly Cavern had not yet nurtured something similar to the consciousness of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Even the instinctive resistance mechanism was very weak.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan's invasion proceeded exceptionally smoothly.</p><p></p><p>In the vastly different Five Attribute heavenly caverns, the densely packed roots spread out like apocalyptic dark clouds, slowly diffusing.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by.</p><p></p><p>The hundreds of millions of contributions smashed out by the Second Personality Ji Shaoli were not in vain.</p><p></p><p>On the day when the final appointments were announced, a festive atmosphere once again pervaded Haixuan Island.</p><p></p><p>"Tianyun Prefecture, Strategy Hall."</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao was inexplicably excited, with myriad thoughts in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Although he was only a lower-ranking active formation master, Tianyun Prefecture was located in the central heartland of the Immortal Alliance. Both in terms of treatment and future prospects, it was incomparable to Zongyunhai's supervision.</p><p></p><p>"Joining the Zongyunhai Mutual Aid Society that day was the best decision I made in my life."</p><p></p><p>"Even though it's just a small step, I've finally taken it! One day, I will return to Tianyu Prefecture in glory!"</p><p></p><p>"Ruoshui..."</p><p></p><p>Just as He Zhenghao's emotions were surging, Ji Shaoli's figure appeared again in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that in the process of allocating positions, everyone had put great effort, they all hurriedly saluted, expressing their gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, we are all one family, no need to be polite." Ji Shaoli waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Following that, he changed the topic: "Since you all are leaving Zongyunhai in the future."</p><p></p><p>"There are some situations that I no longer need to hide."</p><p></p><p>"The Zongyunhai Mutual Aid Society is just a small branch of the Xuanyellow Mutual Aid Society in the Zongyunhai region."</p><p></p><p>"Our organization's influence extends throughout the Xuanyellow Realm. So even if you go elsewhere, you don't have to worry about the organization disappearing."</p><p></p><p>Everyone had anticipated this matter.</p><p></p><p>After all, how could a small regional organization like Zongyunhai Mutual Aid Society be able to know the exam questions in advance?</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's gaze swept across everyone, seeing that they were all calm and satisfied, he nodded in approval.</p><p></p><p>"But it needs to be explained that there is still some competitive relationship between the Mutual Aid Societies in each prefecture. Since you all joined from my side, for the next ten years, your status in the organization still belongs to the Zongyunhai branch."</p><p></p><p>"For this reason, the responsible persons in other regions will not contact you temporarily. Until the end of the term, I will continue to be responsible for coordinating with you."</p><p></p><p>"Although it might be a bit troublesome, it is necessary to prevent malicious competition." Ji Shaoli explained slowly.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone did not show any abnormal reactions.</p><p></p><p>Itâ€™s just that a Golden Core cultivator named Yuhongjian couldn't help but ask, "Friend Ji, I don't know the original intention of establishing this mutual aid society, what is it exactly? Could it be that it's really just mutual help?"</p><p></p><p>With this question, the same doubt emerged in everyone's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Yes. Since joining the society, we have always received help from the organization without contributing anything in return..."</p><p></p><p>"It's really disturbing." Yuhongjian said weakly.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli smiled faintly, "Rest assured. For now, your strength is still too weak, just focus on cultivating."</p><p></p><p>"Organizations will need you one day."</p><p></p><p>Although Ji Shaoli only had a Golden Core cultivation base, no one at the scene objected to his words of "your strength is too weak."</p><p></p><p>After all, everyone present were cultivators who had glimpsed the strength of Dao Realm experts. They all respectfully deferred to Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, Ji Shaoli was not as simple as he seemed on the surface.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, Ji Shaoli's words seemed to appease everyone but actually left them feeling uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew that there's no such thing as a free lunch in this world.</p><p></p><p>The help they received from the mutual aid society was almost like a brand-new lease of life.</p><p></p><p>Although there were no assigned tasks so far.</p><p></p><p>But if one day, the mutual aid society needed their "help"...</p><p></p><p>The group of people subtly glanced at each other.</p><p></p><p>But now that things had come to this point, there was no going back.</p><p></p><p>They suppressed the unease in their hearts deeply, not daring to reveal the slightest hint.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they discussed the examinations they might encounter in their new positions.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Within ten days, one by one, the five people bid farewell and left, heading to their respective prefectures to take up their positions.</p><p></p><p>For a while, Haixuan Island became somewhat deserted.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli then looked at a piece of news, his expression showing some surprise.</p><p></p><p>The person he had been monitoring, Zhong Shentong, unexpectedly made a breakthrough.</p>

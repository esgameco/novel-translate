        <h1>Chapter 884</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Because they could naturally hear that this sinister senior was definitely not speaking nonsense.</p><p></p><p>If his request couldn't be fulfilled, he would really kill!</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual energy synthesis..."</p><p></p><p>The chance discovery that the cores inside the exotic beasts could generate spiritual energy was purely accidental.</p><p></p><p>And to have a breakthrough within three years was quite difficult.</p><p></p><p>Just as Xiao Qing was deeply contemplating with a frown on her forehead, Li Fan suddenly said, "Hehe, I have always been straightforward in my actions! To prevent anyone from harboring any illusions..."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Li Fan appeared in the sky above the empire.</p><p></p><p>Countless blood-colored threads spread out from him, whistling as they flew towards various corners of the imperial city.</p><p></p><p>But in a moment, they returned.</p><p></p><p>However, at the end of each thread, a commoner of the empire was bound.</p><p></p><p>Densely packed like dark clouds concealing the sky.</p><p></p><p>This extremely terrifying scene almost caused many people below to faint on the spot.</p><p></p><p>The red threads contracted, rendering those poor souls unable to even scream, and they were all suppressed by Li Fan in the Five Elements Great Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't simply take the lives of these commoners.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he planned to give them to Yin Shangren as materials for researching the immortal-mortal miasma.</p><p></p><p>After severely intimidating the empire, Li Fan searched around a bit more before leaving in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the red rope left by Mr. Bai for Xu Ke...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not take it temporarily. (New69book→69shux.com)</p><p></p><p>If needed, it could guide a "fated person" to retrieve it.</p><p></p><p>As for his main body...</p><p></p><p>Forget it.</p><p></p><p>After the oppressive demon lord Li Fan left, the people of the empire all felt like they had survived a disaster, crying and holding their heads.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing, on the other hand, felt a jolt in her heart after counting the list of missing personnel.</p><p></p><p>Because to her horror, she discovered that the group of people abducted by the Multiverse Union seniors were all conservative nobles from the empire.</p><p></p><p>They usually didn't get along with the royal family, leading to constraints on various reform proposals.</p><p></p><p>Now, these people had all been taken away.</p><p></p><p>With this, they could mobilize all the empire's forces to solve the issue of upgrading the technology for synthesizing spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"This is definitely not a coincidence, but a warning."</p><p></p><p>"They actually understand the empire to this extent..."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qing shuddered and had no more thoughts of resistance.</p><p></p><p>She hastily summoned the empire's technical backbone to begin discussing the critical issue that would determine the future and destiny.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had returned from the empire's small world, first worked with Tian Yang to relocate the entrance of the space channel to the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>He then personally set up a formation at the exit location.</p><p></p><p>To prevent the possibility of empire personnel escaping. (New69book→69shux.com)</p><p></p><p>As for the outlaws from the empire who were scattered outside, they might never find their way back home in the future, which was not within Li Fan's consideration.</p><p></p><p>After completing all this, Li Fan took a trip to Yin Yin Island.</p><p></p><p>While handing over the commoners to Yin Shangren, he also inquired about the progress of his research.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost there, almost there."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's expression was somewhat strange, showing no joy about the breakthrough in the research.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he seemed absent-minded, restless.</p><p></p><p>Even in his conversation with Li Fan, he only answered sporadically.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Fan simply did not disturb him.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Spirit Wood Realm, Oudaozi and Shang Tianci came to see him together.</p><p></p><p>After years of relentless hard work on construction, the headquarters of the Multiverse Union had finally taken shape.</p><p></p><p>But due to Li Fan's instructions earlier, the final foundation laying required his personal approval.</p><p></p><p>So they came together to ask for Li Fan's opinion.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's spiritual knowledge swept through the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Surrounding the central spirit wood were continuous buildings occupying almost a tenth of the Spirit Wood Realm's area.</p><p></p><p>If a visitor were to come, the first thing they would see would be a ninety-nine zhang high black jade gate.</p><p></p><p>Beyond the gate was a long broad avenue.</p><p></p><p>The surface of the road was predominantly green, made entirely of spirit stone material just like the guard hall entrance of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Walking on it, it would cut off spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with the forbidden airspace formation, it could force visiting cultivators to walk slowly like ordinary people, one step at a time along this audience road.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the long road was a circular grand hall.</p><p></p><p>The central area of the hall was still empty. Li Fan planned to place the statue of the mysterious celestial god there.</p><p></p><p>To give all newcomers a sense of mystery.</p><p></p><p>As the central point of the circular grand hall, various roads branched out in all directions, leading to different functional buildings.</p><p></p><p>Such as the welcoming hall, assembly hall, martial arts arena, as well as the gathering place for the members of Multiverse, the Multiverse channel, and so on.</p><p></p><p>All these buildings were not close together. Interspersed among them were different magnificent sceneries, with mountains and waters layered upon each other, incredibly beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Outside the headquarters of the Multiverse Union, the appearance was mostly in accordance with the aura of the Primordial Realm, a "miniaturized Primordial Realm" constructed by artificial means.</p><p></p><p>In it, various unique landmarks of the states were roughly replicated in the Spirit Wood Realm from the scenery stored in Shang Tianci's Tianjing Gourd.</p><p></p><p>At a glance, Li Fan could see the Luo Yanzhou Great Lake, the Nine Mountain Peaks of the Jiushan State, as well as the familiar Mass Cloud Sea.</p><p></p><p>In Oudaozi's design, the terrain where the Union headquarters complex was situated had been deliberately elevated.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the central area of the Spirit Wood Realm was higher, while the outer areas were lower.</p><p></p><p>Looking from afar, it seemed as if the Multiverse Union was overseeing and suppressing the Primordial Realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Good! Good!"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, a collaborative effort in construction, the more Li Fan looked, the happier he felt.</p><p></p><p>"It's not in vain that I took the trouble to bring Oudaozi here. He even wasted a genuine Enticement Fruit..."</p><p></p><p>"Worth it!"</p><p></p><p>If he had done it himself, it would never have been built so beautifully.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, I am very satisfied!" Li Fan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Shang Tianci showed a pleased expression, while Oudaozi looked proud.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, when can we hold the foundation laying ceremony?" Shang Tianci quickly asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered for a moment and replied, "No rush. Wait for my notice."</p><p></p><p>With that, Li Fan turned into a rainbow light and flew up into the sky above the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Looking down at the newly completed and imposing Spirit Wood Realm below, Li Fan calmed his mind and felt the materials for the formations that had been transported to various places before.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to start the preliminary 【formation refining】."</p><p></p><p>"To turn the entire small world into a treasure cannot be accomplished in a moment."</p><p></p><p>"Especially with the nourishment of a large amount of divine materials, it seems like the scale of this Spirit Wood Realm might undergo changes once again..."</p><p></p><p>"However, as long as the formations are engraved on the world's surface first, no matter how it grows later, it will not escape the bindings."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"It's formation refining, as well as a protective formation for the Union."</p><p></p><p>"It's better to set it all up in one go instead of having to maintain it later."</p>

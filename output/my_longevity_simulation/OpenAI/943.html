        <h1>Chapter 943</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>An old man with white hair, with the character "法" engraved on his forehead, suddenly appeared in front of Li Fan, the Holy Embryo.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what you are talking about?" he asked.</p><p></p><p>"Many knowledgeable cultivators are at a loss after seeing it. How dare you, a mere infant, speak arrogantly?" The old man's face darkened and a hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, the Holy Embryo, was not afraid and shrugged, "So what? After all, you guys don't have a better solution, do you?"</p><p></p><p>This fearless attitude made the old man hesitate for a moment.</p><p></p><p>After a brief investigation of the background of this cultivator who looked extremely arrogant, he felt something unusual.</p><p></p><p>Because this person's background was too clean and simple!</p><p></p><p>As if appearing out of thin air and important information deliberately concealed!</p><p></p><p>In this situation, either this person was a powerful figure's avatar or a spy from the Elder's Council...</p><p></p><p>"But indeed this kid is only at the Infant Realm of cultivation. There's no way he can change the situation."</p><p></p><p>"And anyway, the situation can't get any worse..."</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation, the white-haired old man coldly snorted and said, "Follow me!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Li Fan, the Holy Embryo, felt a blur before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He found himself in the space where Ye Fajue was originally situated. </p><p></p><p>Unlike what he had seen before, the gigantic sphere made up of countless characters, constantly changing and transforming, now seemed corroded, moving extremely slowly.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the sphere, Ye Fajue, a little girl, was also asleep on a long wooden table.</p><p></p><p>Three other cultivators stood in the distance, looking at Ye Fajue with concern.</p><p></p><p>Sensing that the white-haired old man had brought Li Fan, they glanced at him briefly and didn't inquire further.</p><p></p><p>Soon, their attention returned to the almost-stopped sphere made of characters.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be entangled with some mysterious force. When Li Fan's consciousness approached it, he felt the surrounding scenery speeding up a thousandfold.</p><p></p><p>Only when Li Fan decisively withdrew his consciousness did he realize that almost an incense stick's time had passed in just that brief moment.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan understood that the surrounding time flow did not accelerate, but rather, his own thinking speed had been drastically slowed down to the point of almost stagnation.</p><p></p><p>"How did it come to this?" Li Fan couldn't help but furrow his brow slightly and asked the white-haired old man through a mental message, "Could it be that this place was invaded by thieves, leading to..."</p><p></p><p>This was quite a severe accusation, and the white-haired old man's expression changed slightly as he interrupted Li Fan, "Don't talk nonsense."</p><p></p><p>"The cultivators who had contact with Ye Fajue during that period have been thoroughly investigated, and all suspicions of wrongdoings have been ruled out. In fact, Ye Fajue's anomaly appeared inexplicably since the day our Immortal Alliance went to war with the Elder's Council."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, images of the five figures with white nets twisting the principles of heaven and earth in the Elder's Council territory flashed through Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Fajue is a marvel of the Xuanhuang Realm, representing a principle of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that she was injured during this process?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was able to think of this reason immediately, so naturally, the Guardians couldn't overlook it.</p><p></p><p>"The underlying principle of Ye Fajue has not been affected; we have confirmed it repeatedly," the white-haired old man looked at Li Fan with a pensive expression and transmitted sound calmly.</p><p></p><p>"It's not for this reason..." Li Fan nodded and refocused his gaze on the sphere of characters.</p><p></p><p>The eerie force shrouding it seemed to form a barrier on the outside of the sphere, isolating all possible probes from the outside.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan once again sent a strand of consciousness flying into it.</p><p></p><p>Normally, direct contact with Ye Fajue's essence was absolutely prohibited.</p><p></p><p>However, with Ye Fajue now malfunctioning, no one came forward to stop this "healing" attempt.</p><p></p><p>As his consciousness approached the gigantic sphere, the surrounding scenes once again became still.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring everything, he continued flying toward the sphere.</p><p></p><p>As his consciousness sensed it, the space gradually became distorted and twisted.</p><p></p><p>The sphere full of characters also stretched out and flattened, becoming a plane.</p><p></p><p>It was like a piece of white paper from the sky to the ground, with countless characters constantly flashing and changing.</p><p></p><p>From his consciousness perspective, Ye Fajue's speed of deducing techniques didn't seem unusual.</p><p></p><p>But that was because his consciousness's thinking speed also slowed down, putting both sides on the same level.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be caused by this distortion?"</p><p></p><p>His consciousness quickly scanned the surface of the paper, outlining a simple view of Ye Fajue's current situation.</p><p></p><p>"【The Record of Mending the Sky】can cure the world's ailments."</p><p></p><p>"Ye Fajue embodies the laws of the world. As long as I find the corresponding symptoms..."</p><p></p><p>"The first step is to determine whether this abnormality is due to external factors or Ye Fajue's own reasons."</p><p></p><p>His consciousness carefully inspected it once again.</p><p></p><p>As with a person getting sick, if the world was ill, there would naturally be various abnormal signs.</p><p></p><p>Under his consciousness scan, he indeed discovered some clues.</p><p></p><p>"Through greed, the self loses clarity..."</p><p></p><p>After understanding, and confirming the diagnosis, his consciousness dissipated on its own.</p><p></p><p>Outside the sphere, in the vast dark space.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, the Holy Embryo, had been standing motionless for seven days and nights.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man knew he was observing the situation inside the sphere, so he didn't bother him.</p><p></p><p>He was discussing solutions with the other three Guardian Hall cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"It can't go on for more than another month."</p><p></p><p>"If it really can't be resolved, we should quickly ask for the Celestial Healer."</p><p></p><p>"Easy for you to say. If we could bring him here, I would have done it already. The Celestial Healer's whereabouts are elusive, and it's very difficult to contact him. Moreover, he acts according to his own preferences, not even showing face to the masters."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The three of them discussed for a while, frowning.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Li Fan slowly woke up.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the information transmitted by his consciousness, he nodded inwardly. Then, he subtly looked at Ye Fajue, who seemed to be sleeping.</p><p></p><p>"How was it? Any findings?" The white-haired old man didn't have high hopes and casually asked.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Li Fan nodded, "It's quite close to the truth. But we still need final confirmation."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect you to find anything... What did you just say? Something about being quite close to the truth?" The old man's abnormal reaction instantly caught the attention of the other three Guardian Hall cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, they surrounded Li Fan.</p>

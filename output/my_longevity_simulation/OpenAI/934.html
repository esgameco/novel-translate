        <h1>Chapter 934</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>And completely ignoring the existence of Tianzhi's oppression, continued to advance towards the completion of Qi refinement.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until the lack of a special foundation building material that they stopped.</p><p></p><p>This time, they didn't choose anything special as the foundation building material.</p><p></p><p>Instead, Li Fan's original body and avatar jointly used sword dao to create a lower-grade unique item out of thin air, to be used as material for the promotion of the saint fetus.</p><p></p><p>With this "Indomitable Sword" as the foundation, the saint fetus continued to accept the huge cultivation passed down by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>The transformation of sword dao into golden core had become a well-trodden path.</p><p></p><p>And the need for a Daoist cave for the promotion of the saint fetus to Yuan Infant, Li Fan directly cut out a small portion from his Five Elements Grand Daoist Cave.</p><p></p><p>In this way, it took no more than three days from start to finish.</p><p></p><p>Another avatar in the early Yuan Infant stage was completed.</p><p></p><p>But compared to Li Qing, the saint fetus was indeed somewhat weak.</p><p></p><p>Just possessing a realm, in a true battle, the saint fetus might not even be a match for an average Yuan Infant cultivator from the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>However, as expendables deployed for dangerous missions, it was sufficient.</p><p></p><p>After preparing all the supplies for the saint fetus, under Li Fan's control, the saint fetus unknowingly flew out of the Spiritwood Realm.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until they were a distance away from the entrance to Banzhou that the saint fetus fully regained consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The mission requirements surged in their mind, and the saint fetus leisurely headed towards the destination.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan looked at Li Qing and said, "I have cleared the new defensive array mark left on you. But you shouldn't go out recently. Focus on condensing sword dao."</p><p></p><p>"I have a premonition that another chaos in the Xuanhuang Realm is not far away."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>What Li Fan said was not unfounded but was based on what he had just seen in He Zhenghao's memory, where he saw a familiar figure.</p><p></p><p>Congyun Haitian Fate Hall, Gongsun Qixuan.</p><p></p><p>While this person's cultivation was not very strong, and he didn't seem particularly adept at formations, he unexpectedly appeared at the headquarters of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance Formation Hall.</p><p></p><p>It was quite suspicious.</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to the chaos during the 115th era, which triggered the Xuan Net Mutiny, it was all because of this person.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could almost conclude that there must be some subtle connection between this person and the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Let's fight. The fiercer, the better."</p><p></p><p>"Let me see what trump cards you all have."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze seemed to penetrate countless spatial barriers and landed on the boundary line between the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Association.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Realm, cultivators like Li Fan who were eagerly anticipating a war between the two behemoths were indeed rare.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of cultivators still hoped to live their lives in peace.</p><p></p><p>Even the thought of a full-scale war between the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance and the Five Elders Association had never crossed their minds.</p><p></p><p>After all, when battles erupted, countless lives perished.</p><p></p><p>There were no unsolvable conflicts, so why fight?</p><p></p><p>However, on this day, the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance found a direct pretext to declare war.</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elders Association should promptly return the lost treasures of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance. If not, the Immortal League Army will personally take them back."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Immortal League cultivators looked at this announcement with incomprehension, as it seemed to lack coherence and was somewhat inexplicable.</p><p></p><p>"What are the treasures of the Immortal League? How did they end up in the Five Elders Association?"</p><p></p><p>"This pretext... seems too crude, doesn't it?"</p><p></p><p>Just as the cultivators were puzzled, a detailed explanation was soon released, revealing that it was not a fabricated excuse.</p><p></p><p>Once when the Five Elders Association was still one of the Ten Daoist Sects, they had ruthlessly massacred the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the newly established Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance not only suffered the tragic deaths of many core members but also lost many secret treasures to the Five Elders Association.</p><p></p><p>Although later, calamity befell the Ten Daoist Sects, leading to their demise without external interference, and thousands of years had passed.</p><p></p><p>But blood feuds endured for a thousand generations!</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance was reasonable. They didn't seek total annihilation but simply demanded an apology from the Five Elders Association for the past incidents and the return of the Immortal League's treasures. This matter could be resolved without conflict.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The announcement quickly spread across the realm, and most cultivators didn't care much about its authenticity.</p><p></p><p>Because discerning individuals could see it was just a pretext for the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance to initiate war.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders Association, caught off guard, seemed to be in internal dispute and could not provide a clear official response.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, a day after the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance's announcement was made.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance brazenly launched an attack, seemingly very confident in their own strength.</p><p></p><p>This war was not kept secretive like before but was broadcast in real-time to all Immortal League cultivators through the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>While the live broadcast had a slight delay, it didn't dampen the excitement of the Immortal League cultivators, who eagerly gathered around the Tianxuan Mirror to watch the war unfold.</p><p></p><p>The first to engage in battle was none other than the Celestial Venerable Dharma Manifestation, who had been absent for some time.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the last time they appeared, the changes in the Dharma Manifestation were visibly noticeable.</p><p></p><p>Looking down at the earth below, a hint of disdain flashed in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Then, they extended their right hand towards the airspace of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, thousands of celestial patrol arrows originally patrolling the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance were all pulled in front of the Celestial Venerable Dharma Manifestation.</p><p></p><p>These celestial patrol arrows emitted a silver light resembling fine threads, weaving into a large net.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Venerable Dharma Manifestation waved gently and then threw this net towards the Five Elders Association!</p><p></p><p>Five different lights instantly rose from different directions, attempting to stop the descending giant net.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>These lights were obstructed by the flowing light of the Dharma Manifestation, causing a slight delay.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, another Celestial Venerable Dharma Manifestation quietly appeared!</p><p></p><p>It directly stood in front of one of the Five Elders' purple lights.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In the intense vibration, the scene from the Tianxuan Mirror momentarily went blank.</p><p></p><p>When the image resumed, countless cultivators witnessed scenes of five different Celestial Venerable Dharma Manifestations confronting five lights!</p><p></p><p>The entire Xuanhuang Realm seemed to tremble with the impact of this power.</p><p></p><p>And in the Spiritwood Realm, Li Fan had already faintly sensed that the Thirty-Three Days Xuan Master, Wei Qi, whose life was rapidly depleting, the host of the Final Disintegration Disc that he incarnated, was on the verge of ultimate dissolution.</p><p></p><p>Now, his vitality was exhausted, and he had died!</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>A glint flashed in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the Final Disintegration Disc emitted a faint white light.</p><p></p><p>He was receiving a large amount of data, scenes of what Wei Qi had experienced in his lifetime.</p>

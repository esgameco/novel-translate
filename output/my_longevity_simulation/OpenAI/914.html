        <h1>Chapter 914</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The heavenly doctor shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"You know too much, it's not good for you either."</p><p></p><p>"Being able to detect that spatial fluctuation and finding the person infected with this disease shows that your abilities are good."</p><p></p><p>"Focus on learning the jade slip I've passed on to you. Compared to the half-hearted heritage of the Celestials, it's much stronger."</p><p></p><p>The heavenly doctor muttered a few more words.</p><p></p><p>"Don't run around for no reason. The Xuanhuang realm is not as safe as it looks."</p><p></p><p>He gave a final instruction without waiting for Li Fan's response.</p><p></p><p>The figure of the heavenly doctor then disappeared into the air.</p><p></p><p>Only his voice remained, echoing continuously.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood in the room, his tense mind not daring to relax.</p><p></p><p>Maintaining a state of no distractions, he quietly left the Green Wasteland Province.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until he returned to the Spiritwood realm, ensuring thorough safety, that Li Fan finally completely relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"Although I unexpectedly encountered the heavenly doctor this time, fortunately..."</p><p></p><p>"I bet right!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered as he let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Yes, the process of confronting the heavenly doctor just now seemed unusually smooth and not dangerous at all.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, Li Fan was gambling!</p><p></p><p>He was betting that the heavenly doctor was actually a good person!</p><p></p><p>At least, his attitude towards fellow practitioners from the same school would be different!</p><p></p><p>Based on the scenes and dialogues from the previous battles between the heavenly doctor and the Celestials, Li Fan speculated that perhaps the tragic annihilation of the Cloud Waters Heavenly Palace back in the day was not done by the heavenly doctor.</p><p></p><p>It was all a misunderstanding.</p><p></p><p>And apparently, the crazy Celestials seeking revenge on the heavenly doctor was not a one-time occurrence.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly doctor, who could easily kill the Celestials, never actually took action against them.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>All this indicated that it was very likely true as the heavenly doctor himself had said.</p><p></p><p>So, the moment Li Fan saw the heavenly doctor, he unleashed the Five Elements Annihilation Sword intent contained in him, followed by Qin Tang's unique skill, the Cloud Water Illusory Dream technique, to attack the heavenly doctor.</p><p></p><p>It was to disguise himself as a descendant of the Celestials and take on the mission of avenging the heavenly doctor.</p><p></p><p>If the heavenly doctor was truly kind-hearted as he appeared to be.</p><p></p><p>Then, facing a potential junior disciple who might be the only one left in the Xuanhuang realm, the heavenly doctor would certainly not harm Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Even if Li Fan was arrogant.</p><p></p><p>And in reality...</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan had anticipated!</p><p></p><p>The heavenly doctor not only didn't get angry but even voluntarily handed over a golden jade slip!</p><p></p><p>"This is called deceiving a gentleman with a square!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to his past psychological shadows, Li Fan couldn't help but feel a bit proud that he had tricked the heavenly doctor so easily this time.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the main reason for the smooth deception this time was that Li Fan had known in advance about the heavenly doctor's "observation and deduction" ability.</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan performed, his inner thoughts were also in line with the "script".</p><p></p><p>Though the heavenly doctor's strength was extraordinary, he never suspected that he had fallen into a trap set by Li Fan early on!</p><p></p><p>Confident in his diagnostic ability, the heavenly doctor made a misjudgment due to Li Fan's deliberate deception!</p><p></p><p>Reviewing the process multiple times, Li Fan couldn't help but feel increasingly pleased.</p><p></p><p>The last time he was exposed in front of the heavenly doctor almost led to his death.</p><p></p><p>Now, after multiple incarnations, even though his strength still didn't match the other party's, he could successfully deceive the heavenly doctor.</p><p></p><p>This indicated how great his growth was!</p><p></p><p>"As long as I'm given some more time, I might even be able to confront the heavenly doctor head-on!"</p><p></p><p>However, thinking about the heavenly doctor's performance when he was probing just now, Li Fan still furrowed his brow slightly.</p><p></p><p>Although it was a performance, the hundreds of Great Five Elements Annihilation Swords were definitely not taken lightly.</p><p></p><p>Yet, the heavenly doctor effortlessly resolved such an attack.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't even tell how the heavenly doctor turned the Annihilation Swords into a ball.</p><p></p><p>"And there is also that 'disease' the heavenly doctor mentioned..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>A disease that could cause spiritual decay without any form or shape.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly doctor's visit this time was evidently to deal with this disease that Han Zhong carried.</p><p></p><p>Meeting Li Fan was purely coincidental.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps this can also explain why the Han Zhong incident in the previous life didn't cause any waves."</p><p></p><p>"Because the heavenly doctor secretly handled everything."</p><p></p><p>"If this disease were allowed to spread, it might even affect the Xuanhuang realm. In that case, could it be that the heavenly doctor is indeed a positive character?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan rubbed his chin.</p><p></p><p>"For me, that's actually good news. The more positive the character, the smaller the risk of dealing with them."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I don't expose the existence of 'Huan Zhen.'"</p><p></p><p>"It might even bring me some benefits from the other party."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts kept swirling.</p><p></p><p>This discovery made him quite excited.</p><p></p><p>Solving a major worry, Li Fan's mind had already begun planning how to make the most of this new finding.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, the heavenly doctor just mentioned that the invisible bubble carrying Han Zhong out of the Xuanhuang realm was the Eye of the Coan Beast?"</p><p></p><p>"Able to observe the void near the Xuanhuang realm, with those within it not aging..."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it's the handwriting of the Xuan Tian Sect."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Li Fan's tumultuous thoughts eventually settled down.</p><p></p><p>He composed himself.</p><p></p><p>After contemplating for a moment, he finally took out the golden jade slip gifted by the heavenly doctor.</p><p></p><p>The leaves swayed without the wind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart skipped a beat. After thinking for a while, he decided to divide a strand of divine consciousness and enter the golden jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Countless pieces of information flooded into Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"'Heaven Mending Records'?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pressed down on his throbbing temple, roughly browsing the content recorded in the golden jade slip, his expression becoming somewhat strange.</p><p></p><p>The author of Heaven Mending Records was undoubtedly the heavenly doctor.</p><p></p><p>In Heaven Mending Records, it was suggested that with the turning of the heavenly way, it was very possible that the heavenly way would become like humans, producing all kinds of diseases.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the heavenly way needed treatment.</p><p></p><p>But how difficult was it to treat the heavenly way?</p><p></p><p>Humans are the spirits of heaven and earth, and the human body can reflect some of the principles of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>So, to heal heaven, one must first heal humans.</p><p></p><p>The front of Heaven Mending Records elaborated on how to heal all living beings, including humans, on the earth.</p><p></p><p>If the Celestial Alchemy Scripture Li Fan had read before was a comprehensive encyclopedia about myriad species.</p><p></p><p>Then the first half of Heaven Mending Records was an expansion of the Celestial Alchemy Scripture.</p><p></p><p>The specific application of medical skills on all species of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>And after successfully treating all living things in the world, one can move on to the next stage of development.</p><p></p><p>That is, 'Heaven Healing'!</p><p></p><p>Being able to heal the heavenly way requires familiarity with the heavenly way just like one would with the human body.</p>

How could that not be surprising?</p><p></p><p>The people in the city knelt to the ground, afraid to get up.</p><p></p><p>The immortal chief relieved the impact of the giant fire rock and casually threw it towards the deserted wilderness outside the city.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the huge vibration on the ground, the immortal chief swiftly flew towards the position of the central volcano. 69novel.com</p><p></p><p>Before long, the rolling black smoke in the volcano slowly vanished.</p><p></p><p>The violent volcano returned to calmness.</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the world of Dali who witnessed this scene couldn't help but cheer for their survival after the disaster.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Dali led the crowd, lining up in the city, waiting for the arrival of the immortal master.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, they waited for three days and three nights, but the immortal master did not arrive.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Dali felt uneasy, unsure of what he had done wrong.</p><p></p><p>For several days, he could not sleep well.</p><p></p><p>Until seven days later, someone reported that a small mountain suddenly rose outside the city.</p><p></p><p>And it seemed like someone was living on the mountain.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Dali was shocked upon hearing this news.</p><p></p><p>He knew this was the way of the immortals, so he quickly led the crowd towards the mountain.</p><p></p><p>But when they arrived at the mountain, it seemed like there was an invisible barrier blocking them, preventing them from advancing further.</p><p></p><p>"Those destined will meet."</p><p></p><p>"Those without destiny, please leave."</p><p></p><p>A teenage girl timidly spoke to the Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the voice, Grand Scholar Su, among the officials, suddenly looked up. When he saw that the speaker was his younger sister, Su Yuqing, he almost collapsed to the ground, but his friend beside him supported him.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Scholar Su, do you know this fairy maiden?"</p><p></p><p>Grand Scholar Su felt dry in the mouth and speechless, despite his vast knowledge. 69novel.com</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing, summoning up courage, after sending away the civil and military officials, sighed in relief.</p><p></p><p>She patted her chest, gazed at her brother in the distance, and then looked back at the thatched cottage on the mountain, feeling a little worried.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, this immortal master suddenly descended into the Grand Scholar's mansion.</p><p></p><p>Claiming she had an immortal fate, she unceremoniously brought Su Yuqing to this mountain.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, she imparted a set of immortal techniques and advised her to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>But now Su Yuqing's mind was in chaos, how could she have the mindset to cultivate!</p><p></p><p>After much thought, Su Yuqing bravely ascended to the top of the mountain, knocked on the door of the cottage.</p><p></p><p>The door automatically opened, revealing the immortal master sitting cross-legged in mid-air, meditating with closed eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Respectful greetings, Master." Su Yuqing bowed first before mustering the courage to speak, "Please let me return. I have no intention to seek enlightenment as a practitioner. I only want to accompany my family and live peacefully for the rest of my life."</p><p></p><p>Coming from a teenage girl, these words sounded out of place.</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Su Yuqing's heart raced.</p><p></p><p>She had witnessed the immortal master's power in quelling the threat of the meteorite with just one hand. If she angered the immortal master...</p><p></p><p>No, the immortal master had saved so many people in the city. He must be a good person, right?</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing thought so.</p><p></p><p>The immortal master did not respond.</p><p></p><p>There was an eerie silence on the mountaintop.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he spoke slowly, "The fate of immortality cannot be forced."</p><p></p><p>"If you truly do not wish to cultivate, I will not force you."</p><p></p><p>"However, do not regret when you see your loved ones perish in the future."</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing was momentarily taken aback, then her face turned pale, "Loved ones perish?"</p><p></p><p>Without further explanation, the immortal master closed his eyes once again, "You may go."</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing felt a gust of wind, and in an instant, she found herself outside the cottage.</p><p></p><p>The door slammed shut, and Su Yuqing was left feeling bewildered.</p><p></p><p>She hesitantly followed the mountain path downwards, her mind filled with the words the immortal master had spoken.</p><p></p><p>As she was about to exit the range of the immortal mountain, she hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"The immortal master wouldn't deceive me."</p><p></p><p>"Loved ones perish..."</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Su Yuqing's mind recalled the horrific scene of the volcanic eruption, covering the sky with black clouds.</p><p></p><p>She shuddered, and suddenly understood something.</p><p></p><p>Hastily changing course, she ran towards the cottage on the mountaintop.</p><p></p><p>"Master, could it be that the central volcano will erupt again?"</p><p></p><p>She asked towards the door.</p><p></p><p>There was no response from inside.</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing tried to open the door, but it wouldn't budge.</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing knelt with a thud, bowing her head, "Master, I am willing to follow you and cultivate diligently!"</p><p></p><p>Still, there was no response.</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing gritted her teeth, maintaining her posture without moving an inch.</p><p></p><p>As a target of the advanced scholar as well as the pampered daughter of her family since birth, Su Yuqing had been showered with love and affection.</p><p></p><p>After merely a cup of tea, she felt sore all over and couldn't hold on any longer.</p><p></p><p>But she seemed to envision the scene of Dali being destroyed in an instant by an eruption of the volcano.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes became determined, and she gritted her teeth to persevere.</p><p></p><p>An hour, two, passed by...</p><p></p><p>After four or five hours, her consciousness started to blur.</p><p></p><p>Finally unable to hold on, she fainted.</p><p></p><p>Before losing consciousness, she seemed to hear the sound of the cottage door opening.</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing dreamed.</p><p></p><p>In the dream, the end of the world came to Dali.</p><p></p><p>The volcanic smoke rose to the sky, lava flowed freely, and there were no living beings left on the land.</p><p></p><p>It felt like purgatory.</p><p></p><p>This horrific scene instantly woke her up from the nightmare.</p><p></p><p>"Have you seen clearly? That is the future of Dali," the immortal master said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Please save Dali!" Su Yuqing's eyes were already moist.</p><p></p><p>Once again, she bowed and pleaded earnestly.</p>

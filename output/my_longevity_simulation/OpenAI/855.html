            <p>Instead, it was like a sky full of stars!</p><p></p><p>Countless bright clusters, hidden within.</p><p></p><p>From the scenes that flashed above, Ji Shaoli could vaguely see images of exotic beasts, magical treasures, and even cultivators battling!</p><p></p><p>While Ji Shaoli was sitting on this starry sky.</p><p></p><p>A thread hanging down!</p><p></p><p>Those countless clusters of light were like fish in a pond.</p><p></p><p>At first startled, they all instinctively fled.</p><p></p><p>And then some felt curious and slowly approached.</p><p></p><p>These clusters of light were divided into different colors like white, green, blue, purple, orange, etc.</p><p></p><p>The white clusters of light almost had no distinctive aura.</p><p></p><p>From green to orange, the pressure carried by the clusters of light gradually increased.</p><p></p><p>Even in this starry sea, the aura contained within the swiftly passing golden, purple-gold clusters of light made Ji Shaoli, who had seen the remains of the Celestial Master and True Immortal, shocked.</p><p></p><p>"What on earth is this..."</p><p></p><p>Even after experiencing many grand scenes throughout reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>The scene displayed in front of Ji Shaoli at this moment made him instantly stunned.</p><p></p><p>With his mind greatly shaken, he lost composure.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, he withdrew from the state of fishing in the starry sky!</p><p></p><p>The stars disappeared and before him was just an ordinary small pond.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli subconsciously clenched his fists and took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>With his high level of insight, he had realized by now that he might have found something extraordinary!</p><p></p><p>Despite taking a long time to calm his emotions completely, Ji Shaoli once again cast his line with the mindset of a pure fisherman!</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>There was no change in the scene before him.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli held the fishing rod tightly, and after a brief contemplation, he recalled the situation where Master Zhong Shentong just cast a line.</p><p></p><p>"It seems there is a limit to the number of attempts within a certain time interval."</p><p></p><p>Feeling somewhat regretful, he retrieved the fishing rod, removed the camouflage, and lurked and peered from a distance once again.</p><p></p><p>In the small temple, the lives of the master and disciple seemed unchanged.</p><p></p><p>They lived each day eating, resting, and fishing in a mundane routine.</p><p></p><p>When Zhong Shentong fished again, he only caught a white cluster of light and returned disappointed.</p><p></p><p>The young disciple also gained nothing.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it was Ji Shaoli's turn again.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, as an experienced fisherman, he adjusted his mindset to the best state.</p><p></p><p>And then he cast the line!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Ji Shaoli once again found himself in the endless starry sky!</p><p></p><p>It wasn't his first time seeing this extremely magnificent scene, and he had grown accustomed to it.</p><p></p><p>This time he finally maintained the state of fishing in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>"To fish, one needs bait. What do I need to fish up these clusters of light?"</p><p></p><p>Watching most of the clusters of light quickly move away, leaving behind a large blank area, Ji Shaoli couldn't help but ponder.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that this was not within the range of the Huang Realm but formed its own separate space.</p><p></p><p>There was only a bare fishing rod, and Ji Shaoli's body was just a simple image of existence.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, there was no question of adding bait to the fishing rod.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that only the willing get hooked?" Ji Shaoli couldn't help but think so.</p><p></p><p>Because he noticed that as time passed, as if those clusters of light had gotten used to the fishing line he cast and began to gradually approach.</p><p></p><p>Some were even attracted, curiously touching them.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli only felt a slight drop in the fishing rod.</p><p></p><p>Then, unconsciously, he lifted it.</p><p></p><p>The scene before his eyes shattered with a bang, and he was back in the small temple among the mountains.</p><p></p><p>But in his hand, there was an additional white cluster of light.</p><p></p><p>Inside this cluster of light, it seemed to be a separate world that his divine sense couldn't penetrate.</p><p></p><p>Imitating Master Zhong Shentong's previous actions, Ji Shaoli reached out and began to explore.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after taking out a dark green stone, the cluster of light slowly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Is this..."</p><p></p><p>Now Ji Shaoli could be considered well-versed.</p><p></p><p>But after examining it, he found that he had never seen this kind of mineral in his hand!</p><p></p><p>"It's either an extremely rare species or..."</p><p></p><p>"Not of the Huang Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"The white cluster of light should be the lowest grade in the starry sky. It shouldn't be so precious as to be unheard of by me."</p><p></p><p>"So, my guess may be correct."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>The fishing pond here should be an extraordinary treasure from other cultivation realms.</p><p></p><p>Or even more likely, it was an immortal tool from the immortal realm!</p><p></p><p>In the 115th generation, at the end of his life, Li Fan, relying on the Medicine King's True Cauldron, rushed to the Immortal Land and had once seen the remains of a true immortal.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he had felt the majesty of an immortal.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, he once again felt an aura equal to that of the remains of a true immortal from the endless starry sky in this fishing pond!</p><p></p><p>And it was not just one!</p><p></p><p>The fleeting gold and dark gold clusters of light that swiftly crossed through the starry sky made him feel that they were even stronger than the true immortal!</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be my illusion."</p><p></p><p>"Even if there are some errors, the standard of this fishing pond must be extremely high."</p><p></p><p>He recalled the rumors he had heard before.</p><p></p><p>In the ancient Huang Realm, immortal tools existed.</p><p></p><p>However, during the great calamity, all immortal tools, and even the shedding remains of immortals, all disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this fishing pond is the lucky sight of an immortal tool that was left behind?"</p><p></p><p>"With no background, but just an ordinary person like Zhong Shentong, how could he obtain the ‘Life and Death Profound Art,’ and even such miraculous abilities as the Rainbow Divine Light?"</p><p></p><p>"It's all because of this fishing pond, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli quickly thought through the possible causes and effects.</p><p></p><p>"This fishing pond is extremely special. Only with the mindset of a fisherman can one discover it. Perhaps that's why it has been preserved intact till now."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's thoughts were countless, and the greed in his heart couldn't be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>But after all, his mentality was far superior to ordinary people, and he quickly suppressed his desires.</p><p></p><p>Today's attempts had ended, and Ji Shaoli did not choose to act rashly.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he temporarily retreated.</p><p></p><p>When Zhong Shentong's master once again returned empty-handed on the third day, Ji Shaoli stood in front of the pond and cast his line.</p><p></p><p>Thinking that there might be powers related to the ‘immortal’ in the fishing pond, his heart inevitably fluctuated.</p><p></p><p>But perhaps it was because of this reason that he was forced to be expelled after a brief moment in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli couldn't help but be slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Then he realized, "Are all treasure seekers and explorers unsuccessful?"</p><p></p><p>"Only true fishermen can enter the starry sky."</p><p></p><p>Having understood this, Ji Shaoli couldn't help but shake his head.</p><p></p><p>He could only wait for tomorrow to come.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he adjusted his mindset.</p><p></p><p>Once his greed was completely suppressed, Ji Shaoli successfully re-entered the starry sky again.</p><p></p><p>This time, he was especially focused when casting his line.</p><p></p><p>As the fishing line slowly descended, countless clusters of light surged once again.</p>

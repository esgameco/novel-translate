        <h1>Chapter 847</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Moreover, the high-quality picture book truly imbued with Zhao Shijie's power has already been submerged among the countless rough replicas produced by the Wuxian Alliance. Therefore, the spread of the 'One Heart Celestial Venerable' is severely limited."</p><p></p><p>"This strategy is brilliant! I've learned from it." Ji Shaoli, who observed the various operations of the Wuxian Alliance, couldn't help but sigh in admiration.</p><p></p><p>However, after a while, he furrowed his brows slightly, "Nevertheless, such measures can only reduce the harm. They cannot completely eliminate Zhao Shijie's influence..."</p><p></p><p>"The Wuxian Alliance must have some tricks up their sleeves."</p><p></p><p>The reality was in line with Ji Shaoli's prediction.</p><p></p><p>While the vast majority of immortal practitioners were immersed in the deliberately created discussions, there remained a small group of people who couldn't find satisfaction from those replicas. They tirelessly pursued even more exquisite picture books.</p><p></p><p>Little did they know that anything circulating in the market had already been closely monitored by the Wuxian Alliance. It was just a matter of time before they were rounded up.</p><p></p><p>When they finally found a seller they could deal with after much effort, in the instant the transaction was completed, they were all caught in one go.</p><p></p><p>They were accused of attempting to subvert the immortal alliance and were arrested.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of the bustling discussion storm, all of this happened quietly without drawing much attention. If Ji Shaoli hadn't paid attention to these practitioners earlier, perhaps he wouldn't have noticed their disappearance.</p><p></p><p>Confusing and baiting at the same time.</p><p></p><p>With this dual strategy, after over three months, the initial impact of Zhao Shijie's probe was ultimately resolved by the Wuxian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Although it seems like the Wuxian Alliance has won this confrontation, in reality, they have lost," Ji Shaoli shook his head inwardly. "For the Five Elders Council, for this turmoil, what have they sacrificed? Just some mass-produced picture books. However, the Wuxian Alliance had to spend a lot of time and effort to deal with this issue."</p><p></p><p>"This time, they managed to suppress it. But the Five Elders Council can strike back at any time with minimal cost, leaving the Wuxian Alliance to be on constant alert. That's the crushing power of the Celestial Venerable."</p><p></p><p>"The decline of the Wuxian Alliance is evident."</p><p></p><p>"However, I still hope that it can bring me some surprises next."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>There are no eternal hot topics in this world.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the attention of the practitioners towards the released secret books diminished gradually.</p><p></p><p>Replacing it was the upcoming Immortal Alliance Entrance Exam, which was about to begin and garnered high attention. The reason for the high interest in this exam, aside from its unprecedented scale, was due to an explosive announcement made by the Wuxian Alliance not long ago.</p><p></p><p>To counter the watchful eyes of the Five Elders Council, the Immortal Alliance would select thirty-three "Chosen Immortals" through this exam.</p><p></p><p>These Chosen Immortals, once selected, would receive the Immortal Alliance's full support and resources at any cost, allowing them to advance to the Harmonious Dao Realm within ten years.</p><p></p><p>The background or innate talent of the candidates was not the focus of this selection. The Alliance prioritized the individual abilities of practitioners and their unique role in the upcoming confrontations with the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>When the news spread, the practitioners of the Immortal Alliance were driven to madness.</p><p></p><p>Most practitioners considered themselves extraordinary. Even if they were momentarily stagnant in their cultivation, they wouldn't blame themselves but attribute their lack of progress to external factors such as skills or resources.</p><p></p><p>"If I were in the Harmonious Dao Realm, wouldn't I be much stronger than those who rely on their family's protection to ascend? I wouldn't have to retreat step by step under the Five Elders Council's attacks..."</p><p></p><p>Numerous practitioners couldn't help but think along these lines upon hearing the announcement.</p><p></p><p>Their heads filled with ambition, they rushed to register for the exam without a second thought.</p><p></p><p>Even Ji Shaoli felt a moment of temptation, but it was short-lived. Everything has its price, and he knew the consequences of rushed advancement to the Harmonious Dao might be unbearable for him.</p><p></p><p>However, even if he wanted to, there was no guarantee he would be selected.</p><p></p><p>With the multitude of practitioners under the Wuxian Alliance's rule, picking out just thirty-three...</p><p></p><p>Even if some didn't fit the traditional definition of geniuses, each of them undoubtedly had their unique advantages.</p><p></p><p>Some unlucky ones weren't weaker than others. They just lacked the opportunity. Once they soared, they would be unparalleled.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli had no doubt that among these thirty-three individuals, there would surely emerge some previously unknown practitioners who would shine in this selection and shock the world.</p><p></p><p>Yet, he couldn't shake off his doubts.</p><p></p><p>Why would the Wuxian Alliance undertake such an act that contradicted their own face?</p><p></p><p>Setting aside the mysterious method propagators, even the outstanding talents selected from the era seemed to have no future now.</p><p></p><p>The Wuxian Alliance shouldn't be so incompetent.</p><p></p><p>"Unless these thirty-three Harmonious Dao practitioners, the so-called Stars of Hope..."</p><p></p><p>"...are just a facade."</p><p></p><p>"They must serve another purpose."</p><p></p><p>As Ji Shaoli's eyes flickered, amidst the attention of the masses, the Immortal Alliance Exam officially commenced, boasting a higher standard than before.</p><p></p><p>Lasting for a whole month, all participating practitioners would travel to the exam sites through the Tianxuan division mirrors in various states.</p><p></p><p>Until the conclusion of the exam, the sites were completely sealed off and isolated from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Due to the vast number of practitioners participating, the entire Wuxian Alliance in various states grew eerily quiet.</p><p></p><p>During this month, the Wuxian Alliance remained hollow inside.</p><p></p><p>To prevent a sneak attack by the Five Elders Council, not only did the Alliance deploy heavy defense on the borders, but it also initiated a counterattack silently.</p><p></p><p>In the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who had temporarily halted the consumption of the Five Elements Great Celestial Cavern, looked somewhat serious as he received a dazzling, diamond-like sphere handed over by Lin Ling.</p><p></p><p>This item was sent over by the Five Elders Council.</p><p></p><p>As a "cooperative partner" who had successfully traded several times, it was surprising for Li Fan that the Five Elders Council had actively sought help this time...</p><p></p><p>Apparently, this shiny sphere had caused quite a bit of trouble for the Council, and a solution hadn't been found yet.</p>

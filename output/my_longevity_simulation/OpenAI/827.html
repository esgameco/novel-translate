        <div class="content">
            <p>If I had chosen to act just now, then the one who would have died for sure would have been our group!"</p><p></p><p>The thought of narrowly escaping death sent cold sweat dripping from Yu Dayi's forehead. New 69 Bookstore â†’ 69shuxi.com</p><p></p><p>"The Multiverse Union is truly treacherous! It's just a Golden Core cultivator coming for a trade, yet there's a Void Unity expert appearing." Yu Dayi couldn't help but curse inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing I was cautious enough!"</p><p></p><p>As she was about to bow to Lin Ling, she saw a green light enveloping the two of them.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, their figures disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Leaving only the members of the Five Elders Association standing there, feeling confused.</p><p></p><p>"How did they leave, did anyone see it?" Yu Dayi squinted as he observed, then turned to ask.</p><p></p><p>"No spatial fluctuations. Even if their flying speed was fast, there should have been traces left. To vanish in an instant like that..." </p><p></p><p>Everyone unconsciously looked down towards the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Earth veins..." Yu Dayi pondered for a moment, a trace of gravity appearing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Traveling once again through the raging earth veins, Lin Ling did not directly return to the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Instead, guided by Li Fan, they hurried towards the Tianling Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, news came from Tianyang that he had arrived near the Five Elements Grand Cave.</p><p></p><p>Currently, there were no Cultivators from the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance guarding the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan asked Tianyang to wait on the side and not rush in.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, Lin Ling brought Li Fan to meet Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling was curious about the absent-minded Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>However, Tianyang seemed as if he didn't see Lin Ling at all, just standing quietly beside Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan first observed the surroundings carefully.</p><p></p><p>The entrance to the Five Elements Grand Cave was still rarely passed by cultivators at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what circumstance led to its discovery."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought so, but his actions were not slow.</p><p></p><p>A brilliant white light emanated from the Dissociation Disc in his mind.</p><p></p><p>First, Li Fan set up the [Concealing the Sky with One Hand] secret technique on the periphery, to prevent any leakage of aura. Then he quickly set up the infinite array derived from the Dissociation Disc to seal off the entrance.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this kind of action seemed somewhat contradictory. It might even lead to other cultivators discovering the anomaly here...</p><p></p><p>"If I don't do this, the Five Elements Grand Cave will definitely be discovered. With this arrangement, I can buy some time."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, with the infinite formations coupled with the Concealing the Sky with One Hand technique, even if a Harmony Cultivator came, as long as they don't meticulously search, they probably won't find it."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can delay until my Golden Core is complete and devour it."</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Li Fan quickly completed the arrangements, concealing the entrance to the Five Elements Cave.</p><p></p><p>Then he led Lin Ling and Tianyang into the cave.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Upon entering the cave, Lin Ling appeared very surprised.</p><p></p><p>She looked towards the wood-elemental cave within.</p><p></p><p>There, a towering giant tree standing upright could be seen.</p><p></p><p>In terms of size alone, it was probably larger than Lin Ling's physical body in the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Is your predecessor there?" Li Fan asked.</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while, Lin Ling shook her head somewhat regretfully.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she looked somewhat strange: "According to the senior geomancer, they should have awakened their own consciousness by now. It's strange. Is there something missing from here?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan also pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Between caves and small worlds, it's not just the difference in size. This Five Elements Large Cave is much broader than the Spirit Wood, even the Grand Xuan or Departure realms. However, it still falls within the category of a cave."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully recalled his 115th life, the process in which Mr. Bai created a miniature Mysterious Yellow Realm with his bare hands, trying to comprehend where the specific boundary between caves and small worlds lay.</p><p></p><p>After some fruitless contemplation, Li Fan could only set it aside for now.</p><p></p><p>Without hastily exploring this wood-elemental cave, he first searched for traces of other caves.</p><p></p><p>"At this moment, within the five elements, only the wood-elemental cave is visible from the outside. The others, metal, water, fire, and earth, are all hidden."</p><p></p><p>"However, the circulation of the five elements is essentially one. With my personal experience of witnessing the entire cave, it shouldn't be difficult to find them."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes, and his divine sense swept through the wood-elemental cave, tracking the changes of wood-elemental energy in this area of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he had discovered the passage leading to the fire and water caves.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan did not enter directly.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the vast corridors he had previously experienced, these passages had not been extensively explored by the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance. Not only were the passages narrow and hard to find, but even the "void" outside the cave was only covered by a thin layer.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan simply transformed into a Crack Realm Whale using the Melting Furnace Ten Thousand Phenomena technique, slightly widening the void, making it easier to stand.</p><p></p><p>After some effort, Li Fan finally beheld the full view of the Five Elements Grand Cave once again.</p><p></p><p>Five rings, seemingly connected end to end, yet mixed together like a palette of colors.</p><p></p><p>Due to the lack of excessive mining and digging by the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance, the current cave still exuded a vibrant and lively aura.</p><p></p><p>Overlooking several caves, he could faintly sense their combined strong aura, seemingly as one entity.</p><p></p><p>"This scene is completely different from what was destroyed by the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance in the past."</p><p></p><p>"Nevertheless, we still don't know what the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance did during that era, nearly emptying these Five Elements Grand Caves."</p><p></p><p>"However, if they are driven to a dead end in this era, maybe there will be a chance to find out."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stood watching for a long time before flying back into the wood-elemental cave.</p><p></p><p>He also widened the passageway once again.</p><p></p><p>With this, Li Fan and the other two had the opportunity to carefully observe the wood-elemental cave in its entirety.</p><p></p><p>A giant tree canopy occupying almost a third of the sky came into view.</p><p></p><p>A palpable sense of oppression lingered in the air.</p><p></p><p>Even Lin Ling seemed to feel a hint of discomfort.</p><p></p><p>Strangely enough, although the Spirit Tree took up most of the space in the wood-elemental cave, it did not encroach on the lives of other creatures. Instead, it released strands of rich vitality, nurturing all around it.</p><p></p><p>The closer one got to the core of the Spirit Tree, the more abundant the vitality became, forming a faint green mist.</p><p></p><p>Numerous varieties of plants competed for space.</p><p></p><p>Even though Li Fan was well-versed in the Celestial Medical Manual, upon scanning, most of the plants were unrecognizable to him.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Li Fan finally understood the meaning behind the Tianxuan Jing mentioning the wood-elemental cave as "having an extremely large scope, with extremely high wood-elemental spiritual energy and a vast array of medicinal plants."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, this cave belonged solely to Li Fan!</p>

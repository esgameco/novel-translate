        <h1>Chapter 734</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Remembering from memory, it seemed that there were many peers from the Ji family who were sent to different sects. Li Fan was almost certain that the lack of contact over the years was just a diversion.</p><p></p><p>Ji Zhaoxuan was definitely a spy sent by the Ji family to the Tianjian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps using the term "spy" was not appropriate. Because the World Trade Association did not have a direct conflict with the Tianjian Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Traveling throughout the world, all kinds of confidential information are crucial. It is probably through these means that the Ji family can quickly learn about various events in the Xuanhuang Realm and profit from them."</p><p></p><p>"In this way, news about the forging of the boundary-shattering divine weapon by the Tianjian Sect might not be widely known. After all, seeking profit through manipulation and price hikes is the nature of merchants."</p><p></p><p>"Taiyuan refined gold..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>To end the Meteor Immortal Realm scene, one must find the owner who maintains this nostalgic space and resolve his obsession.</p><p></p><p>From the clues currently available, it seemed that Ji Zhaoxuan was the target.</p><p></p><p>"What is his obsession?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immersed his mind, recalling various emotions attached to his body.</p><p></p><p>When he remembered the Ji family, the deeply buried resentment and desire for revenge were keenly captured by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Forced to leave home at a young age, thus harboring feelings of resentment."</p><p></p><p>"But let's try first," Li Fan thought as the idea rushed to his mind.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Li Fan contacted Senior Chu again.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Ji Junior Brother, have you finally come to your senses?" The other person seemed somewhat excited.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That's right. We are all one family, there should be no lingering hatred. I'm getting ready now to return to the headquarters of the [World Trade Association] with you."</p><p></p><p>"If you succeed in becoming the head, make sure not to forget me," Senior Chu's tone changed from the earlier arrogance to a somewhat flattering one.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, citing the reason of searching for Taiyuan refined gold, the two left the gates of the Tianjian Sect and headed towards the Ji family.</p><p></p><p>To avoid arousing suspicion, upon Senior Chu's suggestion, they took a roundabout route.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later, they finally arrived at their destination.</p><p></p><p>A heavenly city completely built of high-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Floating above a bustling market district, practitioners and merchants flowed continuously. When they looked up and saw the city of spirit stones in the sky, their eyes revealed undisguised envy.</p><p></p><p>The marketplace was covered by an array formation where practitioners were unable to fly and needed to pay a certain fee to enter.</p><p></p><p>Walking into the marketplace, a highly pure spiritual energy hit them. It was even more abundant compared to the Tianjian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Senior Chu couldn't help but praise, "Truly the number one World Trade Association, so grand."</p><p></p><p>Leading Li Fan through numerous shops, they arrived in front of a magnificent mansion in the center of the market district.</p><p></p><p>On the plaque, engraved were the four characters "Ji Travels the World".</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan and Senior Chu approached, a golden core practitioner in brocade attire stepped forward to intercept.</p><p></p><p>With a friendly face, he said, "Do you two have invitations?"</p><p></p><p>Senior Chu coldly snorted, "Invitations? What a lack of vision! Why would we need invitations to enter our own family's place?"</p><p></p><p>The brocade-clad practitioner was taken aback and carefully scrutinized Senior Chu.</p><p></p><p>"What are you looking at? It's this friend beside me!" He looked displeased and pointed at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the brocade-clad practitioner shift his gaze.</p><p></p><p>There was no anger, but his brows furrowed slightly, seemingly contemplating something.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, his face showed surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Please wait a moment," he said hurriedly and went into the Ji mansion.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a middle-aged practitioner with a stern face led a group of practitioners out.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on Li Fan, and the middle-aged practitioner, Ji Shiwen, showed no change in expression.</p><p></p><p>"Zhaoxuan, why have you returned? Did you violate the sect rules and get expelled from the sect?" There was no joy of seeing a long-lost relative but a direct accusation.</p><p></p><p>While Senior Chu was about to mediate, Li Fan directly retorted, "Who are you? It's been so long away from home, I don't remember you!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shiwen's face immediately changed color. "How can you speak to your father like that!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, his expression unchanged. "How do you prove it?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shiwen's face instantly turned red.</p><p></p><p>The pressure on his body seemed like it was about to burst like a volcano.</p><p></p><p>The Ji mansion practitioners behind him all showed strange expressions, scrutinizing Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that a fight was about to break out, Senior Chu hurriedly said, "Misunderstanding, misunderstanding! Let's not act rashly!"</p><p></p><p>"I am a true disciple of the Tianjian Sect, Chu Zongyi. We are here with Ji Junior Brother on a mission and passing by the World Market. We just realized that this is Ji Junior Brother's home, so we decided to come back to take a look." He explained quickly.</p><p></p><p>On hearing this, Ji Shiwen paused slightly. He took a look at the hundred or so daoist swords swirling around Li Fan and his eyes showed a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>Gradually retracting his aura, he snorted, "Come in!"</p><p></p><p>Only then did Chu Zongyi breathe a sigh of relief, leading Li Fan as they entered the Ji mansion.</p><p></p><p>After a winding journey, they finally reached the inner hall.</p><p></p><p>Ji Zhaoxuan's father was seated at the top, dismissing the others and asked sternly, "Speak, why have you come here on this visit?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Zongyi was about to respond, but Li Fan interrupted.</p><p></p><p>"You are not qualified enough. Let the Patriarch come!" Li Fan said expressionlessly.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Ji family, the dusty memories seemed to be gradually awakening.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew that Ji Zhaoxuan's father, Ji Shiwen, was just in charge of the World Market and didn't wield much actual power in the Ji family.</p><p></p><p>The real ruler of the Ji family was the old ancestor, Ji Wangxian.</p><p></p><p>Many years ago, he was already an integrated path cultivator, single-handedly establishing the World Trade Association. Ji Wangxian's true cultivation level was unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>"You..." Ji Shiwen's eyes flashed with an uncontrollable anger.</p><p></p><p>But seeing Li Fan's emotionless gaze meeting his own, he couldn't help but shudder.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, he finally suppressed his anger.</p><p></p><p>"Wait here," he grunted, stomped his foot, turned into a stream of light, and flew to the city of spirit stones in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Ji Junior Brother, heâ€™s after all your father. By doing this, are you..." Chu Zongyi asked softly.</p><p></p><p>Smiling, Li Fan said, "By doing this, it shows that we have confidence."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Li Fan didn't care at all, Chu Zongyi chuckled awkwardly and refrained from saying more.</p><p></p><p>As they waited in place, Li Fan noticed that the patterns in the hall were somewhat familiar.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? It seems to be somewhat similar to the emblem of the Wanfa Trade Association in reality, but with some differences."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"It looks like there should be some connection between the two."</p><p></p><p>Before long, Ji Shiwen returned.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me," he said with a stern face.</p>

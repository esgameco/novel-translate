        <h1>Chapter 894</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>A look of fear and shock froze on his face.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the yellow withered branch held by the other party, a hint of a mocking smile couldn't help but appear on the young man's mouth.</p><p></p><p>"The ancient tree of Dìmài, as well as this mysterious rainbow brilliance..."</p><p></p><p>"But to think a Golden Core cultivator could possess such treasures."</p><p></p><p>"When did such an impressive organization appear under our Wanxian Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a good look at it."</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of the young man, Jì Shào Lí's soul was slowly pulled out of his body.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, his body also aged a thousand times over.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, it turned into a skeleton and collapsed on the ground.</p><p></p><p>What the young man was displaying at this moment was evidently an extremely malicious soul-searching technique!</p><p></p><p>Jì Shào Lí's soul, without any resistance, fell into the hands of the young man.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, as the soul-searching technique operated, a large amount of information surged into the young man's mind.</p><p></p><p>The young man's body trembled slightly, a trace of horror flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Heaven Sect?"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the soul-searching technique seemed to trigger a prohibition within the other party's soul.</p><p></p><p>Before the young man could fully read all the information contained in the soul, it disappeared like a withered flower.</p><p></p><p>The young man was unfazed by this scene.</p><p></p><p>If the contents seen during the soul-searching were true, the existence of such prohibitions in the soul was reasonable.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that after thousands of years, the Mysterious Heaven Sect is still lingering?"</p><p></p><p>The young man's eyebrows furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>From the search results just now, it seemed that Jì Shào Lí, a cultivator, had been recruited by a mysterious Mysterious Heaven Sect Law King.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating influence secretly in the Clouds Sea and various places under the Wanxian Alliance, attempting to make a comeback.</p><p></p><p>"In what era are we, and they still haven't given up. Truly ignorant."</p><p></p><p>The young man snorted coldly, but there was no trace of negligence in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The remnants of the Purple Cloud Sect? Actually hiding in such a place..."</p><p></p><p>The young man's eyes revealed a murderous intent, and his figure slowly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>Lǐ Fán, who was not far from the remnants of the Purple Cloud Sect, felt the disappearance of his clone.</p><p></p><p>His figure paused slightly.</p><p></p><p>A few images of the ink painting appeared in his mind, making him thoughtful: "The Palm Heaven Bureau?"</p><p></p><p>"To think such an organization still exists."</p><p></p><p>"But thinking about it, it's normal."</p><p></p><p>"Before, my idea of cultivating Joint Dao cultivators at will once I knew about the existence of the essence of Heaven and Earth was a bit naive."</p><p></p><p>"The Wanxian Alliance has existed for thousands of years, and if they didn't have this level of control, they would have been overthrown long ago."</p><p></p><p>Suppressing his thoughts for the time being, Lǐ Fán looked at the remnants of the Purple Cloud Sect not far away.</p><p></p><p>"Now that the fish has taken the bait, I'll just sit back and watch the show."</p><p></p><p>With narrowed eyes, he scanned with his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>Soon, based on the information he had learned from his past life and a faint, almost imperceptible strand of vitality.</p><p></p><p>Lǐ Fán located the dormant Mysterious Heaven Sect Law King in a sealed chamber deep underground!</p><p></p><p>Seeing his face, it was indeed exactly the same as the one Lǐ Fán had once possessed, Lǐ Chén of the Purple Cloud Sect!</p><p></p><p>Swinging a wave of Silence-Joy Sword Energy, heading straight underground.</p><p></p><p>Carrying a powerful aura full of destruction, as if to engulf everything in the chamber.</p><p></p><p>Just as the black light was about to touch the chamber, golden threads suddenly appeared in the void.</p><p></p><p>The chamber disintegrated, but the protective barrier formed by the rings of golden threads consistently kept Lǐ Chén in the center.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lǐ Fán continued to relentlessly unleash several waves of destruction sword energy.</p><p></p><p>The golden threads were struck by this tremendous force and began to collapse inward.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly on the verge of breaking apart.</p><p></p><p>Lǐ Fán smiled, his figure flickered, and he disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, when Lǐ Chén awoke, he stood still in place for a while.</p><p></p><p>Having slept for too long, it would take some time to rearrange the memories in his mind.</p><p></p><p>However, before he could fully grasp the current situation.</p><p></p><p>Lǐ Chén's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Because he suddenly sensed that the surrounding space seemed to have been suddenly sealed off.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the recent attack he seemed to have suffered, Lǐ Chén instantly understood that his hiding place had somehow been discovered.</p><p></p><p>However, being the Law King of the Mysterious Heaven Sect, he had escaped from the pursuit of the ten immortal sects in the past with ease.</p><p></p><p>Though surprised, he acted calmly and first took out a bottle from his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>He took a sip of the rainbow-colored liqueur inside it.</p><p></p><p>The aura on his body, which had grown somewhat weak due to long dormancy, instantly solidified.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lǐ Chén was regaining his strength.</p><p></p><p>A door in the sky opened, and a group of dozens of black-robed cultivators walked out in unison.</p><p></p><p>Their expressions were solemn, and the killing intent around them seemed almost tangible.</p><p></p><p>And leading them was the young cultivator who had recently probed Jì Shào Lí's soul in the Clouds Sea.</p><p></p><p>His eyes narrowed as he scanned the ruins below.</p><p></p><p>"Three chimes have rung, it is indeed the Law King of the Mysterious Heaven Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Feeling somewhat excited, the young man waved his hand, and the black-robed cultivators instantly flew to various corners in the sky, each holding a small mirror.</p><p></p><p>After taking their positions, infinite green lights radiated from many small mirrors.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the light swept through the space here.</p><p></p><p>Under the cyan light, the underground space became as if transparent.</p><p></p><p>Consequently, Lǐ Chén, who was hiding within, appeared in front of the Wanxian Alliance group.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by everyone, Lǐ Chén's expression remained unfazed.</p><p></p><p>He just stared at the small mirrors held by the black-robed cultivators, a tinge of reminiscence and resentment flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the black-robed cultivators around him, at his command, raised the small mirrors high.</p><p></p><p>Countless cyan beams were aimed at the Law King of the Mysterious Heaven Sect beneath them.</p><p></p><p>The cyan light seemed like solid shackles, binding Lǐ Chén.</p><p></p><p>Lǐ Chén's face showed a mocking expression. "Using something from our Mysterious Heaven Sect to capture the Law King of the Mysterious Heaven Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Are today's cultivators stupid enough to stoop this low?"</p><p></p><p>A crisp bell sound seemed to ring with Lǐ Chén's words, and the blue light that shone from the small mirrors began to shake violently.</p><p></p><p>Then, as if losing control, it erupted fiercely.</p><p></p><p>The cyan light instantly took over the entire remnants of the Purple Cloud Sect.</p><p></p><p>Under the dazzling light, Lǐ Chén's figure disappeared instantly in front of all eyes!</p>

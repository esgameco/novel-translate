        <h1>Chapter 904</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After activating the "[Execution of Profoundness]", as long as there are people or objects related to the Profound Heaven Sect nearby, a melodious sound of bells would ring in the ears.</p><p></p><p>The higher the level within the Profound Heaven Sect, the more bell sounds it would generate.</p><p></p><p>Three sounds were the maximum.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, when Li Fan, full of expectations, strolled around this circular mountain with the secret method of "[Execution of Profoundness]", he did not hear the bell ringing.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Stone Tablet doesn't seem like someone who jokes around..."</p><p></p><p>Although slightly surprised, Li Fan did not doubt that Senior Stone Tablet was playing a prank on him.</p><p></p><p>"Right, the terrain here is so peculiar, the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance must have searched thoroughly earlier. If the [Execution of Profoundness] method was effective, the hidden secrets here would have been discovered long ago."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan suddenly realized. His anticipation increased even more.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Li Fan removed the protection of the Seven Colored Divine Light and wandered again in this circular mountain filled with blooming flowers.</p><p></p><p>The Circular Mountain of Dongyong Prefecture, Flowers of Spiritual Energy. People called it something that could be admired from afar but not played with.</p><p></p><p>Although the special flowers formed by scattered spiritual energy could not be absorbed by cultivators, when approached too closely, these strange energies would synchronize and cause vibrations and assimilation of the cultivator's own spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>If protection and cleansing were not timely, it could lead to a tragic situation of various colored flowers growing within the body.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these flowers could be said to be invasive. Once rooted in the body, they would not only affect the physical body but also the foundation-building treasures and even the Golden Core of Laws, which would be eroded by the flowers of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>So beautiful yet extremely dangerous.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan could boldly walk into the midst of the flowers, letting these flowers bloom within his body.</p><p></p><p>What he relied on was the "[Seven-Colored Illusory Light of Jade Vacuity]".</p><p></p><p>As long as he used the Seven Colored Divine Light to seal his own Dao Domain, even if his physical body was damaged thousands of times, it would not cause any actual harm to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>These flowers of spiritual energy felt the same as ordinary flowers when touched. They had a real texture, and one could even smell the fragrance emanating from them.</p><p></p><p>With more contact, fleeting illusions flickered before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the flowers of spiritual energy appeared within Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he not feel uncomfortable at all, but Li Fan even felt a surge of energy.</p><p></p><p>The speed of spiritual energy circulation increased, and even his thoughts became much faster.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's eyes, the flowers in front of him became more brilliant and lovable.</p><p></p><p>He was even reluctant to move away.</p><p></p><p>Flowers bloomed along Li Fan's meridians, forming a path of blooming flowers straight to his Dantian and brow.</p><p></p><p>Even though he could clearly see the situation in his own body, Li Fan felt no sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>He even vaguely had a thought of "Among the hundred flowers, even if I die, I'll die a romantic death."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quietly watched the performance of the flowers of spiritual energy while coldly snorting in his heart: "So strange, bewitching hearts. It indeed has some similarities with the methods of the Profound Heaven Sect."</p><p></p><p>However, in the time it took for a joss stick to burn, Li Fan's Dantian was completely occupied by these flowers.</p><p></p><p>Densely packed, beautiful yet eerie.</p><p></p><p>The same went for his brow.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that these flowers of spiritual energy finally reached their limit.</p><p></p><p>His body stiffened, and his thoughts seemed to freeze.</p><p></p><p>Outside his sea of consciousness, these flowers even released roots, attempting to root and take up residence.</p><p></p><p>However, they were not allowed to.</p><p></p><p>Without any warning signs, Li Fan's body suddenly burst open.</p><p></p><p>There was no splattering of blood and flesh.</p><p></p><p>Instead, like fireworks, numerous flowers generated within Li Fan's body bloomed in the air.</p><p></p><p>Quite a beautiful sight.</p><p></p><p>As these new flowers gradually mixed with the existing flowers in the circular mountain under the light breeze, they blended seamlessly.</p><p></p><p>In this beautiful scene, a figure slowly reappeared.</p><p></p><p>It was Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Weird..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked up at the floating flowers in the sky, frowning slightly.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had prematurely detonated his own body to prevent further consumption by the flowers of spiritual energy, Li Fan keenly discovered that his soul and cultivation had inevitably suffered some loss during this process.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan watched the sea of flowers floating in the circular mountain, which seemed to move irregularly, and his expression became somewhat serious.</p><p></p><p>If the consumption of the soul could still be barely described by the strangeness of the flowers of spiritual energy, the disappearance of his cultivation undoubtedly indicated one thing: this flower sea was likely transformed by cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Neither alive nor dead, without a solid form, turning into blooming flowers..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking further, Li Fan shivered in horror: "Not surprising for an inheritance from the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>The secret location had been identified.</p><p></p><p>Next, what needed to be done was to decipher it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan ruminated on the spot for a long time until two more and then three more bodies were successively detonated.</p><p></p><p>In the process of constantly feeling the erosion of the flowers of spiritual energy, he finally found a possible way to decipher it.</p><p></p><p>With a focused mind, Li Fan created a fourth body.</p><p></p><p>Then he flew into the air, embracing the flower sea to the fullest extent.</p><p></p><p>This time, Li Fan did not pay attention to the changes within his body but concentrated all his attention on the constantly flashing images before him.</p><p></p><p>These fragmented images were short snippets that flashed by in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly unrelated, they recorded singular events.</p><p></p><p>Within his sea of consciousness, the transformation stone was operating at its peak.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan noted down all these fleeting broken images.</p><p></p><p>When the number of records reached a certain point where his body could no longer bear it, it burst open.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan repeated this step without urgency and created a new body each time.</p><p></p><p>Such abnormal behavior naturally drew the attention of other cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>Originally thinking of coming forward to strike up a conversation and inquire about things, but upon feeling the pressure released by Li Fan, these meddlers all changed their expressions, lowered their heads, and left.</p><p></p><p>Time passed slowly.</p><p></p><p>The flashbacks gathered by Li Fan grew more and more.</p><p></p><p>Like a broken puzzle, as Li Fan collected the puzzle pieces, relying on the powerful computing power of the transformation stone, he attempted to reconstruct the original complete scene.</p><p></p><p>There were not just billions of flowers floating in the circular mountain here.</p><p></p><p>Among them were countless fragmented images.</p><p></p><p>If not for the transformation stone for sorting, Li Fan would have had no chance to piece them together.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, with the constant flickering of blue light, complete images appeared one after another in Li Fan's mind.</p>

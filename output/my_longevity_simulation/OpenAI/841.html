        <div class="content">
            <p>Her intuition, astonishingly accurate.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan and Tianyang were leisurely returning to the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>A destined catastrophe of endless slaughter quietly erupted.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the bizarre degree of this catastrophe exceeded the imagination of all cultivators in the world.</p><p></p><p>On the peak of the state.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that the seismic impact has completely disappeared, and will not reoccur.</p><p></p><p>After some reassurance, the rescue and investigation team dispatched by the Immortal Union headquarters also considered its mission complete.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the state of the peak, they returned to the Immortal Union headquarters.</p><p></p><p>This group of people, including the leader He Dao.</p><p></p><p>Did not sense at all the gradual changes happening in their own bodies.</p><p></p><p>Upon returning to the Ten Thousand Immortals Union headquarters and providing a detailed report.</p><p></p><p>They each returned to their respective states.</p><p></p><p>Until seven days later…</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough. Strange, cough… why does it feel like I can't breathe properly?" Among the investigation team, a Nascent Divinity cultivator named Li Xinhai was meditating in seclusion in the Tianxuan Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly feeling uneasy, his cultivation was forcibly interrupted.</p><p></p><p>Not daring to be negligent, he quickly examined his body by scanning it with his spiritual awareness.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't detect the source of the anomaly.</p><p></p><p>"Cough…"</p><p></p><p>The worry in his heart did not disappear. He tried to suppress the cough, but the more he tried, the more uncontrollable it became.</p><p></p><p>As if trying to cough out his lungs, Li Xinhai looked at the fresh blood in his hand, his face full of horror.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a name that was almost forgotten by the vast majority of cultivators flashed in his mind like lightning.</p><p></p><p>Li Xinhai shuddered, a sense of unspeakable fear enveloping his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal… Mortal… Miasma…"</p><p></p><p>He shivered and quickly contacted his teammates who had gone to investigate the peak before.</p><p></p><p>As expected, without exception.</p><p></p><p>They all showed some discomfort in their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Some mild, some severe.</p><p></p><p>Even the leader, He Dao cultivator Green Willow Immortal Lord, had a floating mind and found it hard to focus.</p><p></p><p>"It's over."</p><p></p><p>Various terrifying legends about the Immortal Mortal Miasma surfaced instantly in Li Xinhai's mind.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts first went blank.</p><p></p><p>Finally, when Li Xinhai came to his senses, he explained his conjecture to his companions.</p><p></p><p>Because among the group, only he had the most severe symptoms.</p><p></p><p>So other cultivators still had some doubts.</p><p></p><p>Especially Green Willow Immortal Lord, couldn't help but rebuke, "How absurd! The Immortal Mortal Miasma has been purified for thousands of years. Apart from humans, they have long ceased to exist in the world. How could we inexplicably…"</p><p></p><p>"Cough…" Green Willow Immortal Lord's words were inexplicably interrupted by a cough.</p><p></p><p>After that, the crowd fell into a dead silence during their discussion.</p><p></p><p>"Stay put, don't wander around. I'll personally go to headquarters. Cough…" Green Willow Immortal Lord no longer doubted, his tone becoming extremely grave.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of years have passed, and various terrifying legends about the Immortal Mortal Miasma have become ancient tales.</p><p></p><p>How to test, symptoms after being infected, how to eliminate, purify…</p><p></p><p>This information has long been buried in history, inaccessible to ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Even Green Willow Immortal Lord, whose position is not low, knew nothing about it.</p><p></p><p>But he knew the seriousness of the situation, contacted first, and then hurried to the Immortal Union headquarters.</p><p></p><p>After the transmission light disappeared, there were already dozens of black-robed cultivators standing like mechanical puppets in formation.</p><p></p><p>After a detailed examination, Li Xinhai's conjecture was finally confirmed.</p><p></p><p>The group that went to the peak had indeed all been infected with the Immortal Mortal Miasma!</p><p></p><p>Shocked, puzzled, horrified…</p><p></p><p>Facing the crisis of life and death, the response of the Ten Thousand Immortals Union was very prompt.</p><p></p><p>They then sent puppet cultivators to investigate the source of the Immortal Mortal Miasma in the underground of the peak. Simultaneously, they announced entering a state of emergency wartime, temporarily shutting down the teleportation arrays in various states.</p><p></p><p>Blocking the borders of each state, prohibiting cultivators from entering or moving between them.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Various measures were taken simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that in this regard, the Ten Thousand Immortals Union do live up to one of the two powerhouses of the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, even though the Ten Thousand Immortals Union's response was prompt.</p><p></p><p>It was still too late.</p><p></p><p>From the return of the investigation team to the outbreak of symptoms, a full seven days had passed.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, the transmission arrays of the Ten Thousand Immortals Union have spread throughout every corner of their territory.</p><p></p><p>Even though many cultivators tend to avoid inter-state teleportation due to the influence of the Devouring White Mist.</p><p></p><p>In face of the vast numbers, there are still numerous cultivators frequently traveling between states.</p><p></p><p>Seven days.</p><p></p><p>Time enough to bring the inexplicable outbreak of the Immortal Mortal Miasma to every state of the Ten Thousand Immortals Union.</p><p></p><p>The sudden wartime state of the Immortal Union had left the cultivators in a state of panic.</p><p></p><p>Thinking that a full-scale war had broken out, the Ten Thousand Immortals Union was caught off guard and resorted to this measure.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was on edge.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the cultivators realized that something worse than they had thought was happening.</p><p></p><p>It was not war; it was the shadow of an ancient calamity that, after thousands of years, once again enveloped the Xuanhuang Realm!</p><p></p><p>The preliminary investigation results of the Immortal Mortal Miasma at the peak have been released.</p><p></p><p>In those years, the Immortal Mortal Miasma existed in every corner of the world.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after unrelenting efforts by the cultivators, the Immortal Mortal Miasma gas was thoroughly purified.</p><p></p><p>But that was only what the cultivators thought.</p><p></p><p>In fact, in a cavity underground at the peak.</p><p></p><p>And as time passed.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that some kind of mutation had occurred.</p><p></p><p>It became more hidden, more powerful.</p><p></p><p>Though the documented methods of dealing with it had not completely failed, their actual effects were greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>A new approach needed to be researched.</p><p></p><p>But before that, the mutated Immortal Mortal Miasma had already shown its ferocious and terrifying fangs.</p><p></p><p>In today's cultivation world, the majority of cultivators are gathered in the suspended celestial cities of their respective states.</p><p></p><p>The concentration of cultivators is even higher than that of the cultivation sects of the past!</p><p></p><p>The spread of the Immortal Mortal Miasma was astonishingly efficient!</p><p></p><p>When the announcement regarding this matter was made by the Ten Thousand Immortals Union, the sound of coughing had already spread everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Initially, under the soothing techniques of the Immortal Union's techniques, the cultivators' emotions were still somewhat optimistic.</p><p></p><p>But as some cultivators fell due to the Immortal Mortal Miasma, panic was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Mortal Miasma treated everyone equally.</p><p></p><p>Once infected, whether it was Core Formation, Nascent Divinity, or even Golden Core cultivators, their symptoms were no lighter, and the chances of falling were no lower!</p><p></p><p>In despair, the cultivators tried various methods to delay the onset of death.</p><p></p><p>But it was all in vain.</p>

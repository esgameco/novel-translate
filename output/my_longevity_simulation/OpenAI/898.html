        <h1>Chapter 898</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>From the young man who passed on the law's knowledge, he knew about the various things that happened in the mysterious yellow realm during his slumber. This gave the Law King of the Mysterious Sky School an illusion that he couldn't help but indulge in absurd third-rate stories.</p><p></p><p>"Clearly, disaster is about to strike, yet the fight continues endlessly..."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps human nature is just like this. The judgment of the Mysterious Sky King back then was not wrong."</p><p></p><p>The Law King of the Mysterious Sky School shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he had no intention of sorting things out.</p><p></p><p>What he wanted to do now was to find the Mysterious Sky King and escape from this place before completely falling into the Immortal Realm in the mysterious yellow realm.</p><p></p><p>If the Mysterious Sky King was missing...</p><p></p><p>Then he would have to figure out a way himself.</p><p></p><p>In the young man's mind, there were many plans to escape.</p><p></p><p>But in the eyes of the Law King of the Mysterious Sky School, the feasibility of these plans was not very high.</p><p></p><p>What is the "Blackest Starry Sky"?</p><p></p><p>Why did the Mysterious Sky King swear that only those with the strength to reach the realm of true immortals could escape from this realm of death?</p><p></p><p>Many escape plans deduced by the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance could indeed help some people escape from the Mysterious Yellow Realm and temporarily resist the attraction of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>But the Immortal Realm affected an unimaginably vast void.</p><p></p><p>In the void, where life was abundant and many immortal cultivation realms resembling stars once existed, all of them had been devoured by the Immortal Realm over the years.</p><p></p><p>The dazzling starry sky had turned dark and lifeless because of it.</p><p></p><p>Escaping from the Mysterious Yellow Realm was something many people could achieve.</p><p></p><p>But escaping from this dark prison...</p><p></p><p>It was not only because the dark void was too vast. Even strong people in the Longevity Realm would only end up lost and trapped alive if they entered it recklessly without any reference point or guide.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, beyond the Blackest Starry Sky, a "Great Wall" had been artificially created.</p><p></p><p>At the edge of the Blackest Starry Sky, all creatures wanting to break through looked on in despair.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Sky King speculated that this "Great Wall" may have been built by the cultivators outside the Blackest Starry Sky to prevent the disaster of the Immortal Realm from spreading further.</p><p></p><p>To cross the Great Wall, one would need to erupt with a power surpassing that of ordinary people in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the so-called escape would just mean moving from one place in the prison to another.</p><p></p><p>"If the Floating Starry Sky Formation is still intact, with the current size of the Mysterious Yellow Realm, when the formation's power is fully activated, perhaps a breakthrough to the pinnacle might be enough to surpass the Great Wall."</p><p></p><p>The young man pondered, looking at the remnants of the Purple Heaven Sect around him.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a wave, he removed the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths array that covered this place.</p><p></p><p>After that, his figure disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The remnants of the Purple Heaven Sect once again fell into the long-standing calm.</p><p></p><p>Seven days passed.</p><p></p><p>The air distorted, and a figure suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>The Law King of the Mysterious Sky School, who had just left and mysteriously returned, had once again come back to this place.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, he had never left.</p><p></p><p>His previous "departure" was just a kind of deception.</p><p></p><p>"I was still thinking if I could meet the brothers in the school, but it's a pity."</p><p></p><p>Since it was not meant to be, the Law King of the Mysterious Sky School did not insist.</p><p></p><p>With a flash, his figure completely vanished.</p><p></p><p>This time, he didn't just disappear as a ploy; he truly left.</p><p></p><p>Ten more days passed, and a secretive figure arrived outside the remnants of the Purple Heaven Sect.</p><p></p><p>His appearance was not clear, and he hid his breath.</p><p></p><p>It was Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>After observing from afar for a while to confirm there was no danger and no warning signals in his heart, he cautiously approached.</p><p></p><p>During this time, after diverting the trouble caused by the Law King of the Mysterious Sky School, Li Fan had been patiently waiting in the area.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the disappearance of the aura here, he waited for a long time before returning.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that the two powerhouses would clash and one would be injured.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance had no reaction to the matter.</p><p></p><p>Even those exposed members of the Cloud Sea Mutual Aid Association had not been pursued by the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>It was as if nothing had happened at all.</p><p></p><p>A silver light appeared in his eyes, and a hidden formation in the air was activated.</p><p></p><p>This was a formation derived by Li Fan using the End-time Disintegration Disc, a formation that was beyond the level of this generation and difficult for other cultivators to detect.</p><p></p><p>Its sole function was to record everything within the range covered by the formation.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan continuously cast spells, the scenes that had happened here more than ten days ago reappeared animatedly in the air.</p><p></p><p>Vividly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the extremely bizarre supernatural powers of the Law King of the Mysterious Sky School, Li Fan felt a trace of shock in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Especially when he effortlessly devoured what seemed to be the Peak Profound Daoist Law Propagator, Li Fan's mind was greatly shaken.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he suppressed the shock in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the true power of the Law King of the Mysterious Sky School?"</p><p></p><p>"It truly is extremely cunning, making it hard to guard against."</p><p></p><p>Putting himself in the Law King's shoes, Li Fan could not think of a suitable way to deal with the Law Propagator.</p><p></p><p>Although he had the power of the Five Elements' Dao Realm and the protection of the Seven-Colored Divine Light.</p><p></p><p>When facing the Law King's extremely strange offensive methods, he couldn't really leverage any significant advantage.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but remember the several mysterious arts of the Mysterious Sky School that he had seen in Senior Sister Zhao's Illusory Realm back then.</p><p></p><p>"The Earth and Heaven Taxation," "The Eternal My Only Skill," "The Soul-severing Gazing Divine Art," and "The Heaven's Sorrow, Earth's Mourning Scripture."</p><p></p><p>Senior Sister Zhao had achieved the Heavenly Venerable Realm with just one skill, "The Eternal My Only Skill," which spoke volumes about the profound heritage of the Mysterious Sky School.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing I was cautious enough not to provoke him based solely on my strength. Otherwise, I might have been forced to fight him again." Li Fan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that after devouring the Law Propagator, the Law King of the Mysterious Sky School seemed to be lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally looking up at the sky, he muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>When he mistakenly took himself for a member of the Mysterious Sky School under a certain coincidence, Li Fan's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the Law King seemed to fall into memory.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could vaguely make out the words "Mysterious Sky King" and "escape" that he occasionally uttered.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't figure out what the Law King was truly thinking.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan continued to play the scenes.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the Law King trying to lay in wait for him with a trick, Li Fan couldn't help but sneer.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't been absolutely sure of his safety, how would he have shown up?</p><p></p><p>Patiently speeding up the playback of the recorded scenes, Li Fan then erased the formation.</p><p></p><p>Then he hurriedly returned to the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>He arrived at the circular hall where the faceless statue of the Mysterious Sky God was placed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stared fixedly at the statue.</p><p></p><p>"I had hoped to use this as bait to attract the remnants of the Mysterious Sky School."</p><p></p><p>"And then, I would capture them and extract some ancient secrets of the Mysterious Sky School from their minds."</p><p></p><p>"Now, it seems that I was being too presumptuous."</p>

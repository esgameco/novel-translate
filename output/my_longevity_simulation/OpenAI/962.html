            <p>Li Fan's voice echoed softly.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren did not refute, but instead gripped his hair tightly, seeming to be in great pain at the realization.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible, how is this possible..." he murmured continuously, looking bewildered and sorrowful.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Li Fan continued to speak slowly, "The Immortal-Mortal Miasma defies the laws of heaven and earth and comes into being."</p><p></p><p>"The only one who can create the Immortal-Mortal Miasma..."</p><p></p><p>"Is the Eternal Life Celestial Venerable! In other words, what stands before us is the remains of a new method Eternal Life practitioner."</p><p></p><p>"The moment the Immortal-Mortal Miasma was born in him, according to the rules laid down by the Celestial Venerable's new method, he thereby attained the realm of Eternal Life. But at the same time..."</p><p></p><p>"The rule power known as the Immortal-Mortal Miasma began to rampage and destroy within his body."</p><p></p><p>"Although a mortal, he can still kill immortals. The power of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma is well-known in the Xuanhuang Realm. But I believe, if that Eternal Life Celestial Venerable wanted to preserve his life, he could have done so completely. However, he chose not to do so."</p><p></p><p>"Because once he did so, it would mean destroying the rules he had established. Although it would not result in the failure of opposition to the laws..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan paused, seemingly contemplating and deducing.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he exclaimed, "It is very likely that there might be a loophole: the Eternal Life Celestial Venerable can ignore the power of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma."</p><p></p><p>"To avoid such a situation, he let the Immortal-Mortal Miasma devour him. It is akin to burying himself alive..."</p><p></p><p>"By doing so, what he obtained was just one result: Xuanhuang cultivators, no matter their cultivation level, from Qi Refinement to the Eternal Life Celestial Venerable, all cannot escape the influence of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked solemn, "But..."</p><p></p><p>"What is the significance of all this?"</p><p></p><p>"After thousands of years, the Immortal-Mortal Miasma has already ceased to exist. As long as one is careful in handling it, cultivators can still slaughter mortals at will, can't they?"</p><p></p><p>"And what was the purpose of this Eternal Life Celestial Venerable? To the extent of sacrificing his own life to create the Immortal-Mortal Miasma?"</p><p></p><p>Deep puzzlement appeared on Li Fan's face.</p><p></p><p>This was not a facade but a genuine sentiment.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren remained silent.</p><p></p><p>He gently waved his hand, and the transparent barrier in front of him disappeared. He carefully picked up the white rib bone on the ground, treating it as if it were a rare treasure, gently caressing it.</p><p></p><p>"When I first saw this rib bone many years ago, it was as if I could see the appearance of its owner when he was alive."</p><p></p><p>"What a perfect countenance it was! All the splendid words in the world combined cannot describe its uniqueness."</p><p></p><p>"However, such a perfect person perished because of contracting the Immortal-Mortal Miasma. At that time, I secretly swore to find the culprit who created the Immortal-Mortal Miasma, leading to the fall of this perfect individual, and then..."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren smiled bitterly, "I never imagined that after seeking for so many years, the so-called culprit was right before my eyes."</p><p></p><p>"And I never knew, never knew at all!"</p><p></p><p>Profoundly moved, Yin Shangren suddenly coughed up a large amount of blood.</p><p></p><p>After wiping it off lightly, Yin Shangren tightly held the rib bone, veins bulging on his hand.</p><p></p><p>Watching this scene, Li Fan's mind suddenly flashed back to the first time he saw Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>It was no different from now, messy clothing, and...</p><p></p><p>Continued..</p>

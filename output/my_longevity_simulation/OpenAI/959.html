        <h1>Chapter 959</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>As he had expected, halfway through, the voice of the Heavenly Doctor once again sounded in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"You did well."</p><p></p><p>Obviously, the Heavenly Doctor had sensed that the seal of the Cloud Water Celestial Palace had been reinforced once more.</p><p></p><p>"With your help, it really saved me some trouble."</p><p></p><p>"If I had gone..."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor chuckled lightly, then fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"In the process of reinforcing the seal, I encountered some things." Before the Heavenly Doctor could speak again, Li Fan took the initiative to report everything that had happened in the Cloud Water Celestial Palace.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Li Fan couldn't help but ask, "Elder, what really happened back then..."</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Li Fan's use of "Elder" had stirred up memories deep in the Heavenly Doctor's mind.</p><p></p><p>His tone unexpectedly fluctuated slightly, "To discover the hidden truth in Hanhai's consciousness, it's quite unexpected, considering your aptitude. No wonder with your talent, Tianjue would regard you as a successor..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression slightly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>"The events of the past..."</p><p></p><p>"Leave it for me to bear. Knowing too much won't do you any good."</p><p></p><p>"You are still too weak now. When your dao reaches its peak, perhaps then you will be qualified to know."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor rarely explained a few more sentences.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan wanted to speak but hesitated, ultimately nodding slightly. </p><p></p><p>"Oh, how's your study of the 'Records of Mending the Sky'? Are there any parts that are difficult to understand?"</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the Heavenly Doctor asked again. It seemed that he was going to personally help Li Fan with any doubts.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't miss this great opportunity, immediately presenting the doubts he had encountered during his self-study process for clarification.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor patiently answered each of them.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, being the Heavenly Doctor, his understanding of the path of "medicine" had already reached an extraordinary level.</p><p></p><p>With just a few words, Li Fan often had sudden realizations.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the Heavenly Doctor's casual remarks, new viewpoints not recorded in the "Records of Mending the Sky" were brought up.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan eagerly absorbed the Heavenly Doctor's teachings.</p><p></p><p>Good times are always short-lived.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, it seemed that the Heavenly Doctor encountered something and interrupted the teaching.</p><p></p><p>"You should have been hiding in a small world before, that's why I spent some effort but still hadn't found you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart skipped a beat, about to respond.</p><p></p><p>But then he heard the Heavenly Doctor continue, "Hmm, a good choice. Until you succeed in cultivation, it's safer for you to stay in the small world as much as possible."</p><p></p><p>"Keep practicing. Remember, techniques are secondary. What truly matters is contemplating the operation of the heavenly path and the essence of the world."</p><p></p><p>"No matter how powerful a technique is, it will ultimately belong to others. Only what truly suits oneself is the most perfect technique."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing these words, Li Fan felt as if struck by a lightning bolt, his mind shaken. </p><p></p><p>"A technique truly suited to oneself?"</p><p></p><p>His eyes seemed perplexed, sinking into endless contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"A gentleman hides his skills until the right time. The current Xuanhuang Realm is not your true stage. Wait a little longer...” The Heavenly Doctor's voice was deep, hinting at something.</p><p></p><p>After that, a golden light descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Swiftly flying and arriving in front of Li Fan in an instant.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until Li Fan snapped out of his contemplation that he saw a floating golden needle in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, back then it was renowned as 'No one comes back from beneath the needle.'"</p><p></p><p>"If I can leave a few behind, perhaps I can preserve some embers."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor's calm voice spoke.</p><p></p><p>"This needle is given to you for protection. The needle does not break, and the person does not perish."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face lit up with joy, "Thank you, Elder!"</p><p></p><p>However, the Heavenly Doctor did not respond further.</p><p></p><p>Without missing the courtesy, Li Fan continued to bow towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Then, looking at the golden needle in front of him, he felt inexplicably puzzled.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he reached out his hand, trying to touch it.</p><p></p><p>It felt different from a physical needle, with a cool sensation.</p><p></p><p>To Li Fan's surprise, a warm flow traveled into his body through his palm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt as if his soul was immersed in a warm spring, comfortable and soothing.</p><p></p><p>A sense of security he had never experienced before rose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"What a treasure!"</p><p></p><p>This thought floated in Li Fan's mind, as he hastened towards the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Upon returning to the Spirit Wood Realm, Li Fan keenly sensed a slight increase in the spiritual energy density here.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the tree people's "tree planting and forestation" project had begun to show initial results.</p><p></p><p>Without disturbing them, Li Fan went straight to where the faceless stone statue was located.</p><p></p><p>When his mind connected with the faceless stone statue, memories of the World Union Council and the followers of the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Both his body and mind truly felt a sense of safety.</p><p></p><p>Although he had preliminarily confirmed that, in the eyes of Tianfajie's cultivators, the Heavenly Doctor was indeed "kind."</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan did not relax his vigilance because of this.</p><p></p><p>He always remained cautious of the Heavenly Doctor's mind-reading ability.</p><p></p><p>Even if not face to face, just with a single golden needle from the other side, it was the same.</p><p></p><p>Unwilling to accept the possibility that the Heavenly Doctor might sense his thoughts through this needle, Li Fan, who had suffered a major setback before, how could he simply accept the golden needle without any grievances?</p><p></p><p>And at present, the only trump card Li Fan could think of to balance against the Heavenly Doctor was the faceless stone statue.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, the true strength of the Faceless Immortal was above that of the Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>With the interference of her stone statue, it should be able to shield the Heavenly Doctor’s perception.</p><p></p><p>Even though he understood that this was somewhat of a temporary solution to a bigger problem, Li Fan still did it anyway.</p><p></p><p>After all, apart from King Xuantian, no one had truly seen the Faceless Immortal.</p><p></p><p>And the Heavenly Doctor was now a real opponent.</p><p></p><p>"Although there are some risks, undoubtedly, the rewards are enormous."</p><p></p><p>"Leaving aside this golden needle, just the guidance from the Heavenly Doctor alone is worth ten years of hard cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"And also, his final reminder."</p><p></p><p>"The operation of the heavenly path, the essence of the world..."</p><p></p><p>"The technique truly suited to oneself..."</p><p></p><p>With narrowed eyes, Li Fan gradually began to form a preliminary idea.</p><p></p><p>However, for now, he set it aside and started to study the golden needle bestowed upon him by the Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>Although given by someone else, it felt as if it had always been a part of Li Fan's body.</p><p></p><p>Without the need for any refining process, he could control it as he pleased.</p><p></p><p>This method was something Li Fan had never heard of before.</p><p></p><p>With a single thought, the golden needle reappeared in front of Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"It's not made of any metal material..."</p><p></p><p>After observing repeatedly with his spiritual sense, Li Fan first came to this conclusion.</p><p></p><p>"And..."</p><p></p><p>After comparing the golden needle from his memory with the one in front of him using the records of the Dao transformation stone, Li Fan made a new discovery.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 978</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In Li Fan's vision, the horizontal and vertical threads that formed the creation stone tablet became denser.</p><p></p><p>This also indicated that this precious treasure of heaven and earth was about to fully take shape.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan guided the threads drawn from Sima Changkong's body, attempting to connect them to the creation stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>Actually, Li Fan wasn't very confident about this matter, after all, it was his first time seeing a real creation stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>But if he just watched it disappear in front of his eyes, it would be a pity.</p><p></p><p>Let's give it a try!</p><p></p><p>To Li Fan's surprise, as Sima Changkong's transformed threads were about to approach, without deliberate manipulation, a suction force seemed to emanate from the stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>The lines rapidly tightened and were continuously drawn into the threads woven into the stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>Like a ball of thread being instantly drawn clean, Sima Changkong's body completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet, flashing intermittently, also seemed to be touched by a trace of dust.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained vigilant, stepping back a bit to a safe position, carefully observing.</p><p></p><p>As the stone tablet was created by heaven and earth again, there were no strange phenomena appearing around. The antique, bluish-grey stone tablet showed no traces of extraordinary treasure. It quietly floated in the air.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to the attraction of Sima Changkong's transformed threads, the creation stone tablet did not move elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>It still remained in this small mountain temple, and it seemed like Li Fan's attempt was successful.</p><p></p><p>However, what puzzled Li Fan was that Sima Changkong did not reappear.</p><p></p><p>Did he just disappear, or...</p><p></p><p>"Have they merged with the creation stone tablet?" Li Fan speculated.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan continued to observe silently, new changes occurred on the creation stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>Countless blood-red characters suddenly emerged on the stone tablet, then these characters began to flow like fresh blood, turning into meandering streams.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, more and more blood characters appeared, and the meandering stream gradually transformed into rushing rivers.</p><p></p><p>Covering the entire stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>A dazzling red light burst forth. When Li Fan looked again, he found that the entire stone tablet seemed to have been flipped like a page from a book, projecting outside the stone tablet!</p><p></p><p>"This is..." Li Fan's eyes widened in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>The changes to the stone tablet continued.</p><p></p><p>Pages filled with blood-red characters continuously flipped as if they were pieces of paper, and the speed increased. The essence of the stone tablet also became thinner, and eventually, upon completing the entire transformation.</p><p></p><p>A stone-made book emitting a dim blood-golden light appeared in front of Li Fan!</p><p></p><p>Compared to the previous creation stone tablet, this stone book exuded a more sacred, ancient, and sorrowful aura.</p><p></p><p>The anomalies gradually subsided, and the radiance emitted by the stone book slowly receded.</p><p></p><p>Hovering peacefully in the air.</p><p></p><p>Just that Li Fan keenly sensed that the stone book seemed to be gradually becoming dimmer.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that, from now on, there will be no more Sima family's 'Bloodline Chronicles' in this world."</p><p></p><p>"In its place is this 'Creation Chronicles' before me."</p><p></p><p>After observing for a long time, a sense of realization began to form in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that with Sima Changkong's current strength, he is not yet qualified to become a vessel like the predecessors of the stone tablet. However, by some twist of fate, the Bloodline Chronicles within him had a rather peculiar effect on the creation stone tablet."</p><p></p><p>"Well, perhaps this is also intentionally orchestrated by the laws of the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>Standing in front of the creation chronicle for a long time, Li Fan pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>With the birth of the creation chronicle, the void filled with nothingness was filled. The originally dark and desolate area regained its normality.</p><p></p><p>However, similar to the Fishing Pond before, in ordinary circumstances, cultivators could not see this creation chronicle at all.</p><p></p><p>Except for entities like Li Fan who personally witnessed its birth, or those who needed a certain fate to have the opportunity to witness it.</p><p></p><p>Walking slowly to the front of the creation chronicle, the scene before Li Fan suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>A crimson river cascaded down from the sky, occupying all of Li Fan's vision.</p><p></p><p>In that river, Li Fan vaguely saw numerous rapidly changing scenes.</p><p></p><p>Just a cursory glance made Li Fan feel dizzy and forced him to look away.</p><p></p><p>"The power of the creation chronicle itself has protective measures to prevent external beings from peeping."</p><p></p><p>After a short rest, Li Fan looked back at the crimson river.</p><p></p><p>This time, he only had a general overview and didn't focus on the details within the river.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the accumulating dizziness was much weaker. During this exploration, Li Fan made a new discovery.</p><p></p><p>The crimson river was constantly generating and endlessly lengthening.</p><p></p><p>These were all the events happening in the Xuanhuang Realm at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing things around clearly was possible with widened eyes, but to gaze into the far distance, scrutinizing the end of the river, one had to resist the continuous strong pressure pushing upstream.</p><p></p><p>Being in the crimson river for a short time, Li Fan soon felt mentally exhausted.</p><p></p><p>It was as though he experienced a cycle of reincarnation in a short time period, and he inexplicably had the urge to take a rest.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra spontaneously operated, dispelling the weakness in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately became alert, temporarily withdrawing from the crimson river.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>He then noticed for the first time that there was a strand of white hair on his head.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan subconsciously looked at the 'Character' panel.</p><p></p><p>Name: Li Fan</p><p></p><p>Realm: Mid Yuan Infant</p><p></p><p>Physiological Age: 63/599</p><p></p><p>Psychological Age: 1379/9999</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Currently just anchoring at the age of 13, my physiological age should be around 32. Yet, it has already reached 63..."</p><p></p><p>"At least my psychological age hasn't changed. It seems the protective effect of the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra is in action."</p><p></p><p>"It looks like the creation chronicle is indeed not something ordinary people can peek into."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan furrowed his brows slightly, "It's not just a matter of accelerating aging."</p><p></p><p>"Since the inception of the Xuanhuang Realm, all information has been stored within it. The crimson river is too vast and turbulent. If one really wishes to find the necessary information from it, pinpointing the crucial moments in time is a huge challenge."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, one might perish before even finding the desired target."</p><p></p><p>"Unless..."</p><p></p><p>"To achieve the Longevity Realm in sync with heaven and earth, or a group with enough numbers unafraid of life and death, launching explorations of different nodes in the crimson river. Every time bringing back some useful information, it would slowly complete history like a puzzle."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed softly, "It seems like I am having some far-fetched ideas. For unparalleled items that can create the Longevity Realm, they won't be so easily controlled, will they?"</p><p></p><p>"However, now that the creation chronicle is fixed here, it is also an immense opportunity for me."</p>

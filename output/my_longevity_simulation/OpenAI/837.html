        <h1>Chapter 837</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>It's just that there isn't that overwhelming hostility, but rather more mysterious and profound.</p><p></p><p>"Attack!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shouted in his heart, his hands not stopping, completely opening the Transcendental Spirit Formation of Alienation Xuantian.</p><p></p><p>A mysterious force instantly enveloped the Inkstone.</p><p></p><p>The Inkstone, which had already sensed the presence of Lin Ling and Tian Yang, was preparing to launch an attack, suddenly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>Then the figure shifted like water, swaying slightly.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, as if covered with a layer of white cloth, the color faded slightly.</p><p></p><p>When the Inkstone was affected by the formation, Lin Ling and Tian Yang's attacks had arrived.</p><p></p><p>Although Tian Yang only had the cultivation of a Deus Ex, his instinct in battle was surpassing Lin Ling.</p><p></p><p>The red and black flames intertwined to form a huge fist, striking the Inkstone.</p><p></p><p>Creating slight ripples.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling's myriad green threads, like flying swords, followed one after another.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly attempting to pierce the Inkstone's heart on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the fierce attacks of the two, the Inkstone just coldly glanced at them, not dodging or avoiding.</p><p></p><p>"Escape!" At the moment when the Inkstone looked at Lin Ling and Tian Yang, Li Fan, who was observing outside and controlling the formation, sensed the danger and reminded out loud.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he activated the formation, releasing another suppressing wave towards the Inkstone.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling and Tian Yang both trusted Li Fan extremely.</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving the warning, they immediately fled. </p><p></p><p>After their escape, without any warning, the space shattered, turning into a void vortex filled with a black aura of destruction like the surrounding area.</p><p></p><p>"Hide!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan calmly commanded.</p><p></p><p>His intuition was correct.</p><p></p><p>After enduring the combined attack of the two and retaliating, the shape of the Inkstone squirmed a bit, then burrowed into the nearby void vortex.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, in the underground space here, from the countless holes, black tentacles all extended out wildly.</p><p></p><p>Frenziedly attacking anything that could potentially exist in the surroundings, creating a storm that bound the Transcendental Spirit Formation in this space, subjected to a huge impact and on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with the End Disintegration Disc, Li Fan promptly analyzed and reinforced the weak points that appeared in the formation.</p><p></p><p>Although the situation was critical, it remained firmly intact.</p><p></p><p>Within the formation, Lin Ling and Tian Yang, who were entangled with the Inkstone, were not faring well.</p><p></p><p>Despite Li Fan's early warning, the wide-range lethal move left them with almost no place to hide.</p><p></p><p>While constantly moving to reduce the frequency of attacks, those black tentacles also had the ability to shatter space.</p><p></p><p>Even Tian Yang's sturdy puppet body dissipated instantly upon being struck by them.</p><p></p><p>However, in the blink of an eye, Tian Yang's body's surface was already tattered.</p><p></p><p>As Tian Yang struggled to evade, he took out a black round stone.</p><p></p><p>With a gentle squeeze, the black stone turned into a liquid and melted into the holes on his body, repairing his injuries.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the pressure on Lin Ling was not as great.</p><p></p><p>After all, as practitioners of Hwadoo cultivation, their bodies were not their actual forms but energy manifestations.</p><p></p><p>Despite being hit by the black tentacles and losing a part, Lin Ling quickly restored herself amid the flashing green lights.</p><p></p><p>After dozens of rounds of restoration, her aura remained steadfast, with no fluctuations or weakening.</p><p></p><p>"Hold on. I've severed her connection with Heaven and Earth using the formation. A spell of this scale won't last long."</p><p></p><p>"Starve her energy to death!" Li Fan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>However, the endurance of the Inkstone surpassed what Li Fan had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Destroying everything it could touch.</p><p></p><p>The momentum was terrifying. If not for Li Fan's prior arrangements and the concealment provided by the Ancient Vein Tree, even though this place was hidden deep underground, it might have been detected by the cultivators of Qiling State.</p><p></p><p>If not for Li Fan's careful planning and ample preparations for Lin Ling and Tian Yang, this first trial might not have been sustained, and they might have lost the battle directly.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder she's of the Ink generation, much stronger than Chi Yan." Li Fan marveled quietly.</p><p></p><p>During this stalemate, Li Fan, who was calmly observing, noticed some clues.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that because the Inkstone had the duty of repairing the underground vortex, it couldn't exert its full power.</p><p></p><p>So when the tentacles struck, the normal space affected around it recovered quickly after a moment of shaking.</p><p></p><p>"If she could attack without restrictions, she could easily turn this place into a void."</p><p></p><p>"But this contradicts her innate duty. So even if her life is threatened, she can't use her full power."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"This also proves the power of the Ink kill from another perspective."</p><p></p><p>"Besides her astounding strength, the duty of the Ink kill is to annihilate everything. Therefore, she acts without restraint..."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan was silently contemplating, the Inkstone, whose attacks were ineffective, finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>Without giving Lin Ling and Tian Yang a chance to catch their breath, it instantly changed its attack method.</p><p></p><p>The dark tentacles that extended from the void vortex broke apart, forming individual, smaller Inkstone entities.</p><p></p><p>Shifting, they advanced continuously towards Lin Ling and the others.</p><p></p><p>Forming a huge encirclement, closing in on the center.</p><p></p><p>"Break through!" Li Fan quickly made a judgment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling and Tian Yang exchanged a glance, then Lin Ling transformed into a layer of green light, covering Tian Yang's body.</p><p></p><p>A powerful light suddenly erupted and clashed against the rapidly approaching black silhouette.</p><p></p><p>The black-green lights collided.</p><p></p><p>Some of the green light quickly dimmed, as if a candle flickering in the wind, seemingly on the brink of extinction.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the black encirclement stood firm like a rock by the sea, only slightly swaying.</p><p></p><p>Impenetrable.</p><p></p><p>Numerous black stones were encroaching the remaining space for Lin Ling and Tian Yang to maneuver.</p><p></p><p>Seeing them gradually being driven into a corner, Lin Ling, who had no combat experience, began to panic.</p><p></p><p>Her momentum plummeted, and for a moment, she even felt despair.</p><p></p><p>Abandoning resistance, she stood still, waiting for death.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Yang for life..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Tian Yang, who had been silent since awakening in this world, finally spoke.</p><p></p><p>With strange howls, a massive energy burst forth from within Tian Yang's body.</p><p></p><p>His puppet body suddenly expanded hundreds of times, carrying Lin Ling, and charged towards the Inkstone!</p><p></p><p>Even though it was like a moth to the flame, a futile attempt, and his body disintegrated upon touching the Inkstone's defenses, Tian Yang remained resolute.</p><p></p><p>He initiated a suicidal charge without hesitation!</p><p></p><p>And as if infected by Tian Yang's faith, Lin Ling's unprecedented powerful vitality emerged.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 817</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Ji Shaoli's clone's eyes flickered as he spent half a million the consecutive times according to the experiences from the previous lives.</p><p></p><p>He exchanged all his contributions for the materials that were about to appreciate rapidly in the upcoming period.</p><p></p><p>"Well, it seems that the downfall of Jiushan Prefecture has indeed had some impact."</p><p></p><p>"The trends of some commodities' prices have already changed. Some have surged ahead, and some have experienced devaluation that was not seen before."</p><p></p><p>The clone operated on the Tianxuan Small Mirror.</p><p></p><p>And there was a ray of light that isolated the Tianxuan Small Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Preventing it from sensing anything from the outside.</p><p></p><p>Then, he spent a million more contributions to purchase some commonly used items.</p><p></p><p>After storing them away, Li Fan quietly left Haixuan Island.</p><p></p><p>The clone remained motionless but contacted He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>Yes, this Ji Shaoli was also acquainted with He Zhenghao.</p><p></p><p>After all, He was well-connected, and everyone was within the Congyun Sea, so it was not surprising for them to know each other.</p><p></p><p>However, their acquaintance was superficial, and they were not close.</p><p></p><p>"He Daoist friend, how have you been recently?"</p><p></p><p>"Are you willing to gather on Haixuan Island?"</p><p></p><p>Not only to He Zhenghao, but the clone also sent banquet invitations to other cultivators he had some acquaintance with from his memories.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"While promoting the merger between the Ten Immortal Alliance and the Five Elders' Association, we must not neglect the research on 'Establishing Foundation with Myself.'"</p><p></p><p>"After all, this is the matter that can truly shake the foundation of the legacy."</p><p></p><p>After leaving Haixuan Island, Li Fan's eyes flickered as he detoured and headed straight for Yinyin Island.</p><p></p><p>Upon arrival, he did not act recklessly but carefully observed his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Faintly, the cries of mortals on the island could be heard.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, he was still studying the mysteries of the Immortal-Mortal Miasma.</p><p></p><p>The small dog with eyes on its abdomen, holding a white rib in its mouth, was running wildly on the island.</p><p></p><p>Appearing very happy.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Yin, succeeded in establishing the foundation using oneself in just three years."</p><p></p><p>"It wasn't long ago."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered, not daring to be presumptuous, and transmitted, "Senior Yin, are you there?"</p><p></p><p>The scene of battling with Senior Yin in the past life was still vivid in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Even with his Nascent Soul cultivation base and numerous magical techniques, he was helpless against Senior Yin.</p><p></p><p>It was only by ultimately resorting to the chaotic spell that he managed to kill Senior Yin.</p><p></p><p>In this life, in order not to disturb the legacy, Li Fan would not easily use the chaotic spell.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he hoped that the other party would continue to derive the 'Establishing Foundation with Myself' technique for him...</p><p></p><p>It would be best to persuade with words.</p><p></p><p>"I'm here. Daoist friend, please come in!"</p><p></p><p>The stone gate on the island opened with a bang, and Li Fan landed.</p><p></p><p>The man and the small dog suddenly turned their heads, staring at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Emitting a threatening growl, their eyes were full of vigilance.</p><p></p><p>As soon as it growled, the white rib fell to the ground with a clatter.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered as he picked it up.</p><p></p><p>This rib came from a cultivator surnamed Su who was the first to be infected by the Immortal-Mortal Miasma.</p><p></p><p>In the 115th life, Li Fan threw it out, attracting the attention of a huge monster made up of countless corpses in the white mist, escaping a disaster.</p><p></p><p>The man and the small dog became fierce when their beloved item was snatched away, but as soon as Li Fan glanced at them.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be greatly frightened and instantly restrained.</p><p></p><p>With its tail drooping, it timidly fled into a building on the island.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chuckled and followed it in.</p><p></p><p>Just as in the previous lives when he saw him, he was still staring at the mortals being tortured in the transparent cage, muttering something in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan threw the white rib in his hand, and Senior Yin instinctively caught it.</p><p></p><p>"What is this..." He was first stunned but then held onto it tightly.</p><p></p><p>"Just now at the door, I found this little thing in the dogâ€™s mouth. I vaguely felt that this bone was extraordinary. I thought the little guy was mischievous and stole it to play with," Li Fan explained with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Senior Yin suddenly realized, and he kicked the small dog hard.</p><p></p><p>Taking the ribbone and putting it away.</p><p></p><p>His expression softened a lot as he looked at Li Fan and asked, "I wonder what brings you here?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked around and said, "This is not a place to talk..."</p><p></p><p>Senior Yin fell silent immediately.</p><p></p><p>However, he was not entangled and led Li Fan to the underground secret room.</p><p></p><p>Passing through Senior Yin's gallery of collection, he also introduced him to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, Li Fan seemed to have some knowledge of these things too.</p><p></p><p>He could provide some input from time to time.</p><p></p><p>This delighted Senior Yin, who had found someone who understood him.</p><p></p><p>His attitude towards Li Fan became even friendlier.</p><p></p><p>After kicking the small dog again, he served two cups of dark, swirling Spiritual Mushroom Tea.</p><p></p><p>Before Senior Yin could speak, Li Fan boldly picked up the cup and drank it all in one go.</p><p></p><p>Without changing his expression.</p><p></p><p>"Good tea!" He even seemed a bit reluctant to finish.</p><p></p><p>This further surprised Senior Yin.</p><p></p><p>"This secret room is quite secretive. Daoist friend, feel free to speak your mind," he took a sip and said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Yin, do you know 'Establishing Foundation with Myself'?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's words made him freeze on the spot the next moment.</p><p></p><p>"Are you here for 'Establishing Foundation with Myself'?"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, he had mentioned this to some others, but most of them thought it was absurd.</p><p></p><p>They just laughed it off.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who came to visit him so earnestly, was the first.</p><p></p><p>In mutual understanding, Senior Yin couldn't help but advise, "But I see you have already achieved the Golden Elixir realm. 'Establishing Foundation with Myself' is not perfect..."</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Li Fan interrupted him.</p><p></p><p>Next sentence, was earth-shattering.</p><p></p><p>"When I first heard about your 'Establishing Foundation with Myself' technique, I was amazed. But after careful consideration, I found significant flaws."</p><p></p><p>"So, after much research and effort, I finally perfected it."</p><p></p><p>"Overjoyed, I came here specifically to share it with you."</p><p></p><p>"I hope Senior Yin can point out any shortcomings."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan said gently.</p><p></p><p>Senior Yin, upon hearing this, suddenly stood up.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Li Fan, full of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>He even laughed, "You perfected the 'Establishing Foundation with Myself' technique? Daoist friend, don't joke with me..."</p><p></p><p>However, his smile disappeared as Li Fan spoke word by word.</p><p></p><p>Soon, his expression turned from surprise to solemn.</p><p></p><p>Then to shock.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, as Li Fan explained the entire 'Establishing Foundation with Myself' technique, Senior Yin's body began to tremble uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible..."</p><p></p><p>"This...How is this possible..."</p><p></p><p>His eyes were full of confusion, as if he was verifying the feasibility of the 'Establishing Foundation with Myself' technique.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how he calculated, he could only reach one conclusion.</p><p></p><p>Flawless, perfect.</p><p></p><p>Senior Yin's legs weakened, and he stumbled to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Pointing at Li Fan, he trembled uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>For a long time, he couldn't say a word.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 923</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>For half a year, Li Qing has been patiently playing the role of a good disciple.</p><p></p><p>Apart from occasionally indulging in playful banter with Sima Jing, the rest of the time he remains restrained and displays courteous manners. He diligently cultivates the "Changing Moon" technique.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing himself is exceptionally handsome. With the mastery of the Changing Moon technique, his charm is further amplified, combined with the effects of the "Reverse Kinship Sutra."</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his refined thoughts, and his outstanding abilities in dealing with people and the world, have reached a peak.</p><p></p><p>Thus, even though he had recently joined the sect, Li Qing has become the most popular cultivator in the Liumoon Peak.</p><p></p><p>During the time spent together day and night, those female cultivators gradually forgot the fact that Li Qing was originally a man.</p><p></p><p>After six months, on this day, Li Qing, who had been hiding for a long time, finally saw a perfect opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong's master, the elder of the Great Dao Sect, the cultivator of the Harmonious Dao, Yang Nishang, was approaching the end of her life. She had failed to make a breakthrough to the Eternal Life Realm and sat in seclusion in the cave.</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong was one of the disciples personally chosen and nurtured by Yang Nishang.</p><p></p><p>The two had a relationship no different from that of mother and daughter.</p><p></p><p>Yang Nishang's death was a huge blow to Huo Jingtong.</p><p></p><p>Even while teaching her disciples, she would suddenly look absent-minded.</p><p></p><p>And precisely at this time, the Great Dao Sect's Nine Veins Seventy-Two Peaks competition began.</p><p></p><p>The ranking in the sect's competition not only affected the distribution of resources within the sect for the next hundred years but was also closely related to the bestowal of the position of Eternal Life Fruit.</p><p></p><p>It is known that even for one of the top ten sects in the Immortal Dao, the Great Dao Sect, the position of Eternal Life Fruit is extremely scarce and highly contested.</p><p></p><p>Yang Nishang's rank had dropped in the last competition a hundred years ago due to the Moon Flower Vein lagging behind, so she had not waited for her turn for the Eternal Life Fruit until her passing.</p><p></p><p>This matter became a knot in Huo Jingtong's heart. She was eager to achieve good results in the competition to honor her late master's spirit in the heavens.</p><p></p><p>However, the Moon Flower Vein's strength was already among the weakest of the Nine Veins. And the potential and talent of the younger disciples were not mature enough to bear such a heavy responsibility.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this competition ended with the worst result in the history of the Moon Flower Vein.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing, whose cultivation was only at the Foundation Building stage on the surface, did not have the qualifications to participate in the competition and was not to blame.</p><p></p><p>However, after the competition, the suppressed atmosphere within the Moon Flower Vein from top to bottom deeply affected him.</p><p></p><p>As they say, shame leads to courage. The female cultivators of the Moon Flower Vein put away their playful thoughts and dedicated themselves to rigorous cultivation, striving to regain their reputation in the next competition.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere within the sect became more serious, making Li Qing's sweet words and witty remarks somewhat out of place and inappropriate.</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong's temperament also changed drastically. Her favoritism towards disciples shifted from valuing appearance to focusing more on cultivation aptitude.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it was only natural for her to gradually become cold towards Li Qing, who seemed to have stagnant progress in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Qing was not worried at all.</p><p></p><p>He knew that although there were many talented female cultivators on the Liumoon Peak, none of them was a true exceptional talent like Zhao Ruoxi, who could bear the heavy responsibility of the sect's rise.</p><p></p><p>So Li Qing was confident that when he displayed his true cultivation, he would completely change Huo Jingtong's perception of him.</p><p></p><p>"But now is not the best time yet. I'll wait a bit longer."</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, as Li Qing had anticipated.</p><p></p><p>The progress of the female cultivators on the Liumoon Peak could not satisfy Huo Jingtong's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Her temper became even more irritable, often reprimanding and scolding her disciples.</p><p></p><p>The disciples dared not object, only bowing their heads in acquiescence.</p><p></p><p>The constant punishment did not change the situation.</p><p></p><p>Under immense psychological pressure, Huo Jingtong's personally accepted disciple, Zheng Keyin, failed to make a breakthrough to the Elemental Infant stage, damaging her cultivation foundation and leading to a dead end.</p><p></p><p>This incident caused the emotionally unstable Huo Jingtong to lose control completely.</p><p></p><p>Not even a comforting word was spoken to her former beloved disciple, and she left in icy silence.</p><p></p><p>The cold indifference in her eyes made Zheng Keyin feel as if her heart had turned to ash.</p><p></p><p>The disciples also felt a sense of despair and sadness.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Li Qing knew that the perfect opportunity he had been waiting for had finally arrived.</p><p></p><p>First, he helped the heavily injured Zheng Keyin back and then spent three full days comforting and mending her broken cultivation heart with the pure Yin Qi in her body, allowing her to break through to the midterm of the Golden Core stage.</p><p></p><p>Then he patiently waited for half a month.</p><p></p><p>When Huo Jingtong had almost given up on expectations from her disciples and was preparing to go down the mountain to recruit new ones, Li Qing secretly knocked on her door this evening.</p><p></p><p>The prohibition on the door was removed, and Huo Jingtong's cold voice came from inside, "It's late. What brings you here?"</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong was silent for a moment, did not open the door, but said, "Go find any of your senior sisters. They should be able to answer your questions."</p><p></p><p>However, Li Qing did not leave.</p><p></p><p>Just as Huo Jingtong began feeling impatient.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing suddenly spoke, "Master, I'm afraid the senior sisters won't be able to answer the doubts in my heart."</p><p></p><p>With that, Li Qing released a trace of his cultivation at the midterm of the Golden Core stage.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The door burst open, and in an instant, Huo Jingtong appeared in front of Li Qing, staring at him with astonishment.</p><p></p><p>From the end of the competition, Huo Jingtong had paid little attention to this exceptionally beautiful junior disciple of hers.</p><p></p><p>After all, his cultivation level was too low, and his aptitude was average.</p><p></p><p>She had never imagined that this disciple she had overlooked had quietly advanced to the Golden Core stage!</p><p></p><p>How long had he been practicing?</p><p></p><p>Not even three full years!</p><p></p><p>Such talent...</p><p></p><p>"Follow me!" A strange light flashed in Huo Jingtong's eyes as she grabbed Li Qing and pulled him into the room.</p><p></p><p>"A pure Yin physique?" After a careful inspection, Huo Jingtong was once again shocked.</p><p></p><p>At the beginning when she accepted him as a disciple, she had slight aversion to the fact that he was originally a man disguised as a woman, so she did not examine him in detail. She only scanned him roughly with her divine sense.</p><p></p><p>She never expected that a man's body could also possess an extreme Yin physique like this!</p><p></p><p>"Master, is my cultivation speed a bit odd?" Li Qing asked.</p><p></p><p>"Too fast..."</p><p></p><p>"Fast to the point that I'm starting to feel scared." Right at that moment, Li Qing timely spoke.</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong's expression became serious.</p><p></p><p>After carefully examining Li Qing's cultivation progress in the "Changing Moon" technique, she confirmed that everything was in order. She suppressed the joy in her heart and comforted him, "It's okay, don't worry. True geniuses indeed have cultivation speeds beyond ordinary people's imagination."</p><p></p><p>"The faster, the better."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, have you revealed your cultivation progress to anyone else?" After a while, Huo Jingtong realized and quickly inquired.</p><p></p><p>"No. Besides you, Master, I have not dared to mention this to anyone else. The senior sisters have been busy cultivating during this time, so they also do not know that I have entered the Golden Core stage." Li Qing honestly confessed.</p><p></p><p>"Very good. Remember, from now on, don't easily reveal your cultivation progress to outsiders." Huo Jingtong earnestly cautioned.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>From that night onwards, Li Qing moved to a separate courtyard next to Huo Jingtong's and was personally guided in his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing, who had become a treasure in Huo Jingtong's heart and had the full hopes of Huo Jingtong entrusted to him, received completely different treatment than before.</p><p></p><p>There was no shortage of spiritual stones, elixirs, and various martial arts classics to satisfy his needs as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he had any questions, he would ask them in person, and Huo Jingtong would patiently answer his doubts, even if it meant temporarily suspending her own cultivation, day and night.</p><p></p><p>This way, for half a year, Huo Jingtong's thoughts were almost entirely focused on Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>However, what made Huo Jingtong a bit anxious was that during this period, Li Qing's cultivation had indeed progressed.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the true geniuses, the speed that he had demonstrated before, the difference was too great.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I have put too much pressure on him."</p><p></p><p>After checking Li Qing's body once again and failing to find the reason for her doubts, Huo Jingtong could only think so.</p><p></p><p>Thus, she specially granted Li Qing's request for a vacation to relax.</p><p></p><p>After three days when Li Qing returned, his spirit and energy seemed somewhat different.</p><p></p><p>And his progress in cultivation had skyrocketed suddenly.</p><p></p><p>He was not far from advancing to the late Golden Core stage.</p><p></p><p>This made Huo Jingtong slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>However, not long after, Li Qing's cultivation speed gradually slowed down with almost noticeable changes.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing once again asked for permission to go out and relax.</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong agreed outwardly, but inwardly she began to have doubts.</p><p></p><p>She followed Li Qing discreetly.</p><p></p><p>Inside the room, Li Qing was entwined with one of her female disciples named Han Haiyan and Sima Jing, all three hugging each other.</p><p></p><p>The room was filled with joy and intimate moments.</p><p></p><p>They continued to speak absurd and wanton words, making Huo Jingtong unable to bear it, almost charging in to stop this inappropriate behavior.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, Huo Jingtong held back.</p><p></p><p>After all, despite their absurd actions, the senior sisters were willing participants, and they did not violate any sect rules.</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong's expression changed constantly, and in the end, she did not interrupt their enjoyment but left in a cold manner.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the figure of Huo Jingtong moving away outside, Li Qing's lips curved into a barely noticeable smile.</p><p></p><p>The actions became more intense.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, when he returned to Huo Jingtong, seeing her displeased expression, Li Qing didn't say a word and knelt down on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple knows his mistake!"</p><p></p><p>Huo Jingtong coldly snorted, "What mistake have you made?"</p><p></p><p>"Disciple should not have lost his mind and engaged in that absurd act with the senior sisters. But..." Li Qing looked pitifully.</p><p></p><p>"But what?" Huo Jingtong glared at Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>"But every time after we finished, I felt my cultivation speed increasing. In order not to disappoint you, Master, I..." Li Qing's face was filled with self-blame.</p><p></p><p>Listening to Li Qing's words, Huo Jingtong felt a jump in her heart.</p><p></p><p>After an examination, she found that Li Qing was not lying.</p><p></p><p>The pure Yin energy in Li Qing's body had become more refined. Its effect on cultivation meant that a month later, Li Qing smoothly broke through to the late Golden Core stage.</p><p></p><p>"Such cultivation speed..."</p><p></p><p>Once again shocked, Huo Jingtong was filled with doubts.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that engaging in that act really benefits cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Unaware of it all, Huo Jingtong couldn't help but feel perplexed.</p><p></p><p>After quietly browsing through some classics, Huo Jingtong understood the reason.</p><p></p><p>Should be due to Li Qing's extremely special physique!</p><p></p><p>Thus, she chose to turn a blind eye to Li Qing's disruptive actions on the Liumoon Peak.</p><p></p><p>"As long as he can maintain this cultivation speed..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't let it be exposed in a hundred years. Soon, the entire sect will be astonished."</p><p></p><p>Immersed in the fantasy of the Moon Flower Vein rising to fame, Huo Jingtong dwelt on these thoughts.</p><p></p><p>After several tests, confirming that Huo Jingtong had tacitly approved of his actions, Li Qing no longer restrained himself.</p><p></p><p>He showed his fangs to the female disciples on the Liumoon Peak.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing, who was already highly acclaimed among these female disciples, had now become Huo Jingtong's treasure. With the help of disciples like Sima Jing who had fallen into Li Qing's clutches, Li Qing could easily deceive most female disciples into bed without much effort.</p><p></p><p>Thus, at an extremely terrifying speed, Li Qing began reaping the Yin essence of many female cultivators.</p><p></p><p>And the benefits brought were quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>Just three months after breaking through to the late Golden Core stage, with the help of this unimaginably pure and vast Yin essence, Li Qing successfully formed his Nascent Soul and entered the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p></p><p>This type of cultivation speed could no longer be simply described as fast.</p><p></p><p>Even Huo Jingtong, who had witnessed Li Qing's cultivation progress from start to finish, couldn't help but feel an innate fear.</p><p></p><p>She seemed to understand that initial confusion Li Qing felt when he came to her door late at night.</p><p></p><p>Just as she began to waver in her heart, wondering if she should continue allowing Li Qing's misdeeds.</p><p></p><p>She received orders from the sect to assist in investigating the rising teaching incident in the sect's subordinate area like a spark.</p><p></p><p>Feeling helpless, she could only caution Li Qing verbally before hastily leaving the mountain, hoping to complete the mission quickly and return.</p><p></p><p>But little did she know that without her presence, there was virtually no one on the Liumoon Peak who could restrain Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>And Li Qing no longer concealed his actions. He openly harmed the remaining female cultivators on the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, using the term "harm" alone was not accurate.</p><p></p><p>In fact, those female cultivators not only did not resist.</p><p></p><p>Most of them even enjoyed it.</p><p></p><p>Physiological and psychological factors aside, the most crucial point was that these female cultivators on the Liumoon Peak discovered that after enjoying with Li Qing, their cultivation speed was faster than before.</p><p></p><p>Initially, the difference was insignificant.</p><p></p><p>But as time went by, this gap gradually became evident.</p><p></p><p>Who could resist something that brought joy and benefited cultivation?</p><p></p><p>Thus, in just half a month's time.</p><p></p><p>The Liumoon Peak fell completely.</p><p></p><p>Not a single female cultivator could escape Li Qing's clutches.</p><p></p><p>When Huo Jingtong returned and faced this situation, all she could feel was shock.</p>

            <p>It seemed as if through layers of barriers, Li Fan was making eye contact with the Saint Fetu.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan felt neither coldness nor fear, but rather a sense of familiarity and warmth.</p><p></p><p>Just like...</p><p></p><p>He felt as if he had met the owner of this skull before.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, this feeling..."</p><p></p><p>The Saint Fetu stared at the skull for a long time, reluctant to leave.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the other exhibits in the divine treasure museum, there was no detailed explanation about this skull.</p><p></p><p>It only served as an identification mark for the first skull infected with the immortal plague. And perhaps it was because of being infected with the immortal plague during its lifetime, it was no different from the bones left by ordinary people after death.</p><p></p><p>In comparison to the shimmering white light emanating from the bones left by some powerful cultivators who had fallen, the difference was apparent at a glance.</p><p></p><p>According to the guide, perhaps besides the curator of the divine treasure museum, no one else knew why this item was placed in the very center of the museum.</p><p></p><p>But being able to be displayed at the very center of the entire museum was enough to show its value.</p><p></p><p>Whether in terms of material value or commemorative value.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the subtle emotional fluctuations from the original, the Saint Fetu also knew that this skull seemed equally important to himself.</p><p></p><p>However, it was evidently not the right time to take it away.</p><p></p><p>After giving the skull one last deep look, the Saint Fetu Li Fan was about to leave when suddenly he thought of something.</p><p></p><p>Turning back again, he carefully memorized every detail of the skull in his mind, from top to bottom.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps we can reconstruct the appearance of that cultivator based on the shape of the skull."</p><p></p><p>It was for this reason that the original had given him this instruction.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan himself did not possess this kind of technology, in the vast Xuanhuang Realm, there were cultivators who could accomplish this.</p><p></p><p>Next, the Saint Fetu wandered around the museum for a long time.</p><p></p><p>When he was certain that the original had synchronized and mastered all the contents of the "Three Calamities Hundred Tribulations Bright God Technique," he pretended to be still interested and left the divine treasure museum.</p><p></p><p>The escort cultivator dutifully waited outside the door.</p><p></p><p>Until finally escorting the Saint Fetu out of the Immortal Alliance Headquarters, then he disappeared in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the subtle presence of a cultivator following him behind, the Saint Fetu Li Fan sneered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, he decisively chose to end his own life.</p><p></p><p>His Nascent Infant's Daoist Cave burst open with a huge booming sound, like a blazing ball of light suddenly exploding.</p><p></p><p>By the time the tracking cultivator realized something was wrong and hurriedly caught up.</p><p></p><p>The Saint Fetu Li Fan had already disappeared without a trace, turning into ashes!</p><p></p><p>The tracking cultivator, dressed in black, also had the character "法" carved on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>He frowned as he looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, there were no signs of a cultivator’s fall. </p><p></p><p>"Elder Zhen guessed right, it is indeed a divided incarnation!"</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I didn't expect it to be so decisive and cautious, severing the clues!"</p><p></p><p>"It seems we'll have to start from that 'Jinfa Jade Tablet'."</p><p></p><p>A hint of unwillingness flashed in the black-robed cultivator's eyes, but after repeatedly inspecting the scene and finding no clues, he could only leave disappointed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was carefully studying the "Three Calamities Hundred Tribulations Bright God Technique" in a secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>He had previously issued a "divine oracle" through the faceless idol, asking those cultivators from the Alliance of Ten Thousand Realms to find a person who could reconstruct the original appearance based on the skull.</p><p></p><p>He believed that it wouldn't take long for results to surface.</p><p></p><p>"If we can determine the person's identity, perhaps we can know what eternal memorial, which has a tremendous attraction to the 'True Self,' truly is."</p><p></p><p>Setting this matter aside for now, Li Fan now focused all his attention on the technique in front of him.</p><p></p><p>As the derived version of the "Three Perilous Ghost Divine Obscure Record," and considering Li Fan's requests for the performance and characteristics after practicing the technique were similar to that, the "Three Calamities Hundred Tribulations Bright God Technique" could almost be considered a simplified version of the Obscure Record.</p><p></p><p>The "Three Perilous Ghost Divine Obscure Record" cultivates countless thoughts within oneself and nurtures them to become entities resembling ghosts and gods. Each ghost and god could be seen as an independent individual, but they were created by the original and were constrained by the original.</p><p></p><p>After the completion of the "Three Calamities Hundred Tribulations Bright God Technique," there would also be countless "ghosts and gods" within one's body.</p><p></p><p>However, instead of cutting off one's own thoughts to form separate entities, they were formed through refining and nurturing divine thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, those ghosts and gods were still part of Li Fan's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Although the power ceiling was slightly lower, there was no risk of losing control.</p><p></p><p>Instead, by turning distractions into conscious entities, one could purify their own Dao heart even more.</p><p></p><p>Of course, for Li Fan, who possessed the "Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Mantra," he didn't have many distractions in the first place.</p><p></p><p>So, to cultivate this technique, Li Fan needed to specifically develop many thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later.</p><p></p><p>In front of Li Fan, a humanoid and non-humanoid, seven-armed abnormal transparent creature with two heads suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Examining the conscious creation for a moment, Li Fan always felt something was off.</p><p></p><p>Although they were both conscious creations, there seemed to be a significant difference compared to the ones created by the "Three Perilous Ghost Divine Obscure Record".</p><p></p><p>After much contemplation, Li Fan suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>"As my mind is unwavering, the conscious creations generated will naturally lean towards righteousness."</p><p></p><p>"It's not as gloomy as the Obscure Record."</p><p></p><p>After realizing the reason for the difference, dark thoughts emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the conscious creation became increasingly sinister.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan followed suit.</p><p></p><p>Normally, generating conscious creations was not an overnight process.</p><p></p><p>It required combining the insights gained from one's experiences of calamities and tribulations, slowly nurturing them.</p><p></p><p>Over time, a vast army of conscious creations could be cultivated.</p><p></p><p>But was Li Fan an ordinary person?</p><p></p><p>He had experienced too much in numerous cycles of reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>The historical developments of various branches in the Xuanhuang Realm, along with all the experiences and knowledge acquired, had become the foundation for constructing conscious creations.</p><p></p><p>Even benefiting from witnessing the scene where countless cultivators were destroyed by a True Immortal with a glance in the past. The expressions of fear and despair displayed by countless cultivators at the end of the world's destruction allowed Li Fan to create some conscious creations that looked terrifying and chilling.</p><p></p><p>With the support of the "Wuji Yingxu Technique," his willpower was unmatched.</p><p></p><p>However, after more than ten days, an army of sinister and vengeful "ghosts and gods" was established within Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>As he felt his own creation, even Li Fan couldn't help but frown.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid that once these creations are set free, true demons will descend."</p><p></p><p>With a swift thought, Li Fan appeared in an empty space.</p><p></p><p>It was the enhanced version of the Two Yi Microcosm Formation used to trap Yan Fangzhou!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yan Fangzhou seemed unable to endure the inhuman torture.</p><p></p><p>Lifeless, he sat blankly on the ground, his eyes devoid of spirit, like a walking corpse, completely devoid of vitality.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 949</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Have you heard? It seems like the Immortal Alliance has no intention of building a floating city in Jiushan Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Why is that so?"</p><p></p><p>"It's because the spatial instability here. Even though Tianzun Faxiang thoroughly plowed Jiushan Prefecture, it didn't change the spatial properties. The teleportation array still can't be used stably."</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, the cultivators present suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>"Not building the floating sky city... With such a vast land, the Immortal Alliance surely wouldn't just leave it alone, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Hard to say. We used to be able to take advantage of the geographical features of Jiushan to build cities along the mountains. Now that it's all flat land here, there is no natural defense. The crucial point is that the teleportation array can't be used, so if we are surrounded and can't get quick support, whether it's defense costs or effectiveness, it's all too poor."</p><p></p><p>"You guys don't understand anything! The Five Elders were personally sent to us by our Immortal Alliance, can they dare to attack proactively? What danger could there be?"</p><p></p><p>"This friend is too naive. Haven't you heard of the balance of power, the ancient rule? Can't the outcome of a battle define a hero? The last victory we achieved was just due to catching the Five Elders off guard. In my opinion, if both sides were to fight again, the outcome is still uncertain!"</p><p></p><p>"When our Immortal Alliance was defeated before, you didn't say that. (source of a Chinese novel, www.... )"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The cultivators within the fortress were very enthusiastic about discussing the situation in the Xuanhuang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Each held their own views, arguing endlessly, no one conceding to the other. It was quite lively.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan observed the scene and noticed one cultivator who was only listening but not participating in the discussion like himself.</p><p></p><p>This person looked to be in his thirties, wearing a black long robe with silver-white hair tied up. Listening to the discussion, his eyes showed a hint of disdain.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, he didn't quite agree with the viewpoints of the cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly, bought a pot of top-quality spirit wine, and sat down in front of the man.</p><p></p><p>"What should I call you, fellow Daoist?" Li Fan smiled as he poured a cup for the silver-haired cultivator and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" The silver-haired cultivator was cautious about Li Fan's sudden attentiveness.</p><p></p><p>Instead of answering Li Fan's question, he narrowed his eyes, continuously sizing up this cultivator who approached him so familiarly.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, fellow Daoist, no need to be suspicious. I can see at a glance that fellow Daoist carries himself differently, not like an ordinary person, with deep thoughts in his chest. Also, you seem curious about the future situation in Jiushan Prefecture, so I wanted to be bold and ask for fellow Daoist's opinion."</p><p></p><p>The silver-haired cultivator looked at Li Fan's sincere face, hesitated for a while, then let go of his guard. (source of a Chinese novel, www....)</p><p></p><p>Finishing the spirit wine in one go, the silver-haired cultivator transmitted a message, "Hehe, you've asked the right person!"</p><p></p><p>"My name is Xin Hongzhang, and when it comes to the extent of information, none present here can compare to me!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan quickly poured another cup for Xin Hongzhang.</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang was very satisfied with Li Fan's attitude and transmitted, "Given our fateful encounter, I'll disclose a bit to you. Just remember not to spread it."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, what those people said is correct. The Immortal Alliance indeed does not plan to construct a floating city in Jiushan Prefecture. But this doesn't mean the Alliance is giving up on this place."</p><p></p><p>"On the contrary, the Alliance has decided to establish the first free trade zone in history here."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? A free trade zone?" Seeing how serious the other party was, Li Fan couldn't help but become genuinely interested. "What does that entail?"</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang proudly said, "The Ten Thousand Laws Chamber should be familiar, right? The Immortal Alliance and the Five Elders have been in opposition for many years, prohibiting the flow of their own goods. The Ten Thousand Laws Chamber in Jiushan Prefecture, situated in a buffer zone between the two, is beyond the control of both. Thus, the Chamber openly sells various precious items. Despite the high prices, cultivators come from afar to make purchases."</p><p></p><p>"All of this is a thing of the past. Tianzun Faxiang showed his might, and the entire Jiushan Prefecture was leveled. Although the Ten Thousand Laws Chamber hasn't been completely wiped out, it has suffered heavy losses. It'll be hard to return to how it was before..." Xin Hongzhang shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"But the head of the Ten Thousand Laws Chamber is indeed remarkable. He managed to convince the Immortal Alliance to lift the trade restrictions here in Jiushan Prefecture. Cultivators from both the Alliance and the Five Elders can freely trade goods here, just need to pay a small tax."</p><p></p><p>"Led by the Immortal Alliance, assisted by the experienced Ten Thousand Laws Chamber. It is said that they have reached an agreement with the Five Elders in secret, ensuring that even if hostilities resume, neither side will choose to wage war in Jiushan Prefecture..."</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what safe free trade signifies?" Xin Hongzhang stared at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded, showing excitement in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Imagine, what is now a desolate Jiushan Prefecture will soon be bustling. It may even surpass the four main territories in the heartland. If one can seize this rare opportunity, surely it could change one's fate..." Xin Hongzhang downed another cup of spirit wine, releasing his inner excitement.</p><p></p><p>"If not for this reason, I wouldn't have come all the way to this remote border area."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan fell silent for a while, seemingly digesting this shocking news.</p><p></p><p>Then he raised his head, full of gratitude, and said to Xin Hongzhang, "Fellow Daoist, for sharing such crucial insider information with me, even though we just met coincidentally..."</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang waved his hand, "Hehe, if you hadn't taken the initiative to strike up a conversation and ordered a pot of good wine, I wouldn't have told you this."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, this matter isn't that secretive. The Alliance's announcement will likely come out soon. We just happened to get a slight advantage."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, if you have ample contribution points at hand, you might want to keep an eye on the qualifications to purchase caves in Jiushan Prefecture. I bet, within ten years, the prices of these caves will at least double! Even tripling or quadrupling won't be a problem. If one can buy a few caves from the start and sell them later..."</p><p></p><p>"It's simply a risk-free profitable deal!"</p><p></p><p>Xin Hongzhang passed on another message quietly.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Xin really has foresight!" Li Fan, looking like he had just woken from a dream, patted his head and said, "How did I not think of that?"</p><p></p><p>He proceeded to praise Xin Hongzhang continuously.</p><p></p><p>Having drunk quite a bit of spirit wine and listening to Li Fan's flattery, Xin Hongzhang couldn't help but feel a bit floaty.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he saw Li Fan seem hesitant about something.</p><p></p><p>In the end, as if having made up his mind, he mysteriously transmitted, "For treating me so well, I shouldn't be stingy either."</p><p></p><p>"The truth is, I have a secret technique called [Divine Presence]. If fellow Daoist doesn't mind, I can impart it to you."</p>

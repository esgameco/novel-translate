        <h1>Chapter 750</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"The Imperial Treasury can only be entered by those of royal blood," Xiao Qing explained.</p><p></p><p>"But I can't enter now either, right?" Xu Bai shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Perceive it with your heart, and this invisible barrier will no longer exist," the Imperial Princess said softly at this moment.</p><p></p><p>After saying that, she demonstrated it herself. Stepping forward, she penetrated the barrier and entered the Imperial Treasury.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai, upon hearing this, closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, a strange feeling surged into his mind.</p><p></p><p>In the boundless darkness, it seemed like the sound of a heartbeat.</p><p></p><p>Coming from all directions.</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to what he had seen before, the entire Imperial Palace seemed to be formed by the body of some giant monstrous beast.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai suddenly realized something.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the Imperial Treasury was the heart of this monstrous beast.</p><p></p><p>The various monstrous beasts in the empire were all bred using Xuke's secret methods.</p><p></p><p>With Xuke's blood in him, it was natural that he could not be stopped here.</p><p></p><p>With resolve in his heart, Xu Bai took a step forward. It was as if he had passed through some transparent film, and the next moment, he found himself inside the Imperial Treasury.</p><p></p><p>Instead of peeking at the various objects placed here, he looked at the Imperial Princess and Xiao Qing, saying, "Indeed, I entered. But this doesn't explain much. [Website Link]"</p><p></p><p>"Only those of royal blood can enter..."</p><p></p><p>"This kind of rhetoric," Xu Bai shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Princess smiled and said, "You don't need to be so skeptical. Take a walk around this treasury, and you will understand."</p><p></p><p>"Everything inside here is valuable to the empire, aren't you worried I might take a few things with me?" Xu Bai asked.</p><p></p><p>"If you want, you can empty this place. But actually, the most precious things here are the memories of the imperial rulers throughout history," Xiao Qing said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Princess then made a gesture of invitation towards Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>With a cold snort, Xu Bai casually flew to a monstrous beast with dual wings, a Silent Flying Turtle.</p><p></p><p>"Silent Flying Turtle: Lifespan can reach up to three hundred years. Its meat can treat disorders such as ADHD and manic behaviors. However, be cautious, turtle blood is harmful, consuming it will shorten your life."</p><p></p><p>A voice accompanied by an image suddenly appeared in Xu Bai's mind.</p><p></p><p>The character in the picture looked very similar to Xuke.</p><p></p><p>He was sitting in front of an experiment table, dissecting a Silent Flying Turtle while continuously making records.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, various information about the Silent Flying Turtle flooded into Xu Bai's mind.</p><p></p><p>Before Xu Bai could digest it, new images appeared shortly after.</p><p></p><p>This time, a woman was recording the data. Her appearance still bore some resemblance to Xuke.</p><p></p><p>"New discovery: the wings of the Silent Flying Turtle can be used as materials for creating airborne skyships. While maintaining high-speed flight, it reduces flight noise to a minimum."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The images kept flashing.</p><p></p><p>The protagonist changed over a dozen times, and the research on the Silent Flying Turtle kept advancing.</p><p></p><p>In the end, techniques that could mass-produce Silent Flying Turtles quickly appeared. This reduced the nurturing time significantly, allowing completion of a full life cycle in just three years.</p><p></p><p>The images vanished, and Xu Bai pondered over the myriad of additional data in his mind, then looked at the Imperial Princess.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>"The initial ruler of the empire was bred from the Sacred Blood by the Sacred Emperor [Xuke]," the Imperial Princess replied with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"And the second generation of emperors as well."</p><p></p><p>"It has been passed down through generations."</p><p></p><p>"In essence, the imperial royal family throughout history and the Sacred Emperor Xuke are actually the same person." The Imperial Princess answered with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Although he had known this already, Xu Bai still pretended to be surprised: "What kind of sorcery is this?"</p><p></p><p>"Isn't there a difference between technology and good and evil?" The Imperial Princess shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"Although our flesh and blood are the same, we each have our own consciousness. You can also see us as different individuals."</p><p></p><p>"However, due to the connection of the Sacred Blood Embryo technique, we can achieve a synchronization of thoughts."</p><p></p><p>"What you just felt were the research results of the emperors throughout generations on the Silent Flying Turtle."</p><p></p><p>"Before each ruler of the empire dies, in addition to the Sacred Blood Embryo, they must leave their thoughts in the Imperial Treasury."</p><p></p><p>"The new successor will inherit the vast majority of wisdom and experience of the past emperors."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, the ruler of the empire will become stronger and stronger."</p><p></p><p>"In this way, a sustainable empire can be established."</p><p></p><p>"Sustainable empire…" Xu Bai snorted, showing no respect, "Forget about the Eternal Transcendent, even if it's a United Daoist, it's doubtful if you can resist us."</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Princess paused upon hearing this, her face reddened.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai scanned the Imperial Treasury before asking, "Although there are many strange data here, there are only a few that are truly valuable."</p><p></p><p>"I urgently need to return to report, so tell me, what are the most powerful technologies of the empire?"</p><p></p><p>"With enough leverage, I can also negotiate for more with the Alliance for you," Xu Bai hinted.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Princess looked at Xiao Qing outside the invisible barrier.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xiao Qing nod, the Imperial Princess pondered and said, "The perception of 'valuable' may not be the same for you and me when it comes to the empire's strategic goals."</p><p></p><p>"From the perspective of the empire's strategic objectives, one of the highest technologies is the method to breed and manipulate Rift-jaw Whales."</p><p></p><p>"The second is spatial latitude and longitude positioning."</p><p></p><p>"With these two technologies, the empire can continuously open up spatial channels, as far away from the Huang Realm as possible," the Imperial Princess said slowly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai showed a mocking expression, "I have heard of your ridiculous plans from colleagues who have already sacrificed themselves."</p><p></p><p>"The idea is good, but…"</p><p></p><p>"If it were so easy to leave the Huang Realm, then over the thousands of years, someone would have already done it. Why should it be you?"</p><p></p><p>"Why are the cultivators who sought refuge in small worlds during the Great Calamity still obsessed with returning to the Huang Realm, instead of escaping from the small worlds?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not that they don't want to. They just can't do it."</p><p></p><p>"I advise you to abandon this unrealistic fantasy and join our Multiverse Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>Facing Xu Bai's scorn, the Imperial Princess's face showed no emotion.</p><p></p><p>Instead, she interrupted Xu Bai's words with unusual determination, "What if our goal from the beginning was not to escape from the Huang Realm?"</p><p></p><p>This left Xu Bai stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Not to escape from the Huang Realm? Then why are you going through so much trouble for?" he asked.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Princess smiled faintly, "To buy time."</p><p></p><p>"To get further away from the Huang Realm as much as possible. Reduce the probability of being affected by calamities when they occur in the Huang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"At the same time, patiently wait."</p><p></p><p>Sooner or later, a savior-like figure will appear and rescue the Huang Realm from the calamity of destruction."</p><p></p><p>(The end of this chapter)</p>

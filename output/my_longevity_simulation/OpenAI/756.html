        <h1>Chapter 756</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The mysterious and yellow world is such, not to mention in this empire's small world.</p><p></p><p>Qing and Hong are still fine, they both have lived long enough. In their memories, some years ago when they were still in the Imperial Beast Sect, they had also seen the legendary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But the Empress did not fare so well.</p><p></p><p>Even after accepting memories from past emperors of the empire, she had a somewhat vague impression of the power of the legendary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But after all, the Empress was just an ordinary human.</p><p></p><p>Facing the awe-inspiring pressure inadvertently emanated by Liu San, the Empress turned pale, almost unable to catch her breath.</p><p></p><p>The three of them bowed, but Liu San did not respond, remaining silent.</p><p></p><p>Qing and Hong suddenly felt uneasy.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, before today, the two of them had always been somewhat skeptical of the so-called "Union of Myriad Realms".</p><p></p><p>After all, from start to finish, there was only one person responsible for contacting them from the Union of Myriad Realms. Moreover, the contact person's cultivation level was not particularly advanced.</p><p></p><p>Just the Infant Transformation realm that was visible everywhere in the Mysterious Yellow World.</p><p></p><p>But today, seeing the legendary cultivators with their own eyes, all doubts in the minds of the three of them were completely dispelled.</p><p></p><p>Because strong individuals are the best proof!</p><p></p><p>It was impossible for a Grand Cultivator to come here to deceive, right? With just a move of their hand, they could destroy the empire. There is no reason for them to do so.</p><p></p><p>Various thoughts flashed through their minds in an instant, and the attitude of the three individuals from the empire became even more respectful.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the atmosphere was almost right, Liu San snorted lightly before nodding slightly, "Let's go, show me the few things you reported."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Xu Bai also spoke, "The recent attacks by the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals have become more aggressive, Elder Liu does not have much time to waste."</p><p></p><p>The Empress nodded quickly and led them to an underground chamber in the high tower palace.</p><p></p><p>The chamber was extraordinarily spacious, with a celestial navigation device, over a thousand pieces of different types of spiritual crystals, and a huge furnace already prepared.</p><p></p><p>Liu San first looked at the navigation device and suddenly asked, "If one knows the coordinates of a realm relative to the Mysterious Yellow World, can one determine the position of that realm in the void through this navigation device?"</p><p></p><p>Qing was stunned at first, then showed a look of horror.</p><p></p><p>Because she realized that the "realm" mentioned by Elder Liu was not referring to the small world of the Mysterious Yellow World.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it referred to another cultivation realm that is on par with the Mysterious Yellow World.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qing's evaluation of the Union of Myriad Realms rose another level. After pondering for a moment, she shook her head and said truthfully, "Due to the influence of the Immortal Ruins, there are temporal and spatial distortions around the Mysterious Yellow World. If only the coordinates are known, even if one can escape the attraction of the Immortal Ruins, they may still misidentify the direction halfway there."</p><p></p><p>"However, if the destination coordinates are set in advance, it is possible to perform temporal and spatial corrections continuously while moving forward. Theoretically, it is entirely possible to safely arrive at the destination coordinates," Qing quickly added.</p><p></p><p>"It's not easy for this realm to develop such technology despite the lack of spiritual energy." Liu San nodded approvingly.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Qing and the others couldn't help but show a hint of joy in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Liu San then focused his gaze on the thousands of different types of spiritual crystals.</p><p></p><p>With just one glance, he bypassed them directly.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the eyes of a Grand Cultivator, these savage beast abilities were just trivial playthings.</p><p></p><p>Liu San then looked at the continuously roaring and throbbing huge furnace.</p><p></p><p>The faint dangerous aura emanating from it made him squint his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>"You are playing with fire here." After a long time, Liu San gave such an evaluation.</p><p></p><p>"The unification of all beasts is indeed possible. But if that terrifying creature is really created, I'm afraid your so-called 'Heart Unity Mantra' won't be able to control it."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps if the Supreme Treasure of the Imperial Beast Sect, the 'Wheel of Ten Thousand Beasts,' still exists, there might be a glimmer of hope."</p><p></p><p>Qing and Hong exchanged a glance, surprised.</p><p></p><p>But before they could respond, Liu San only left behind a sentence and then left directly.</p><p></p><p>"I already know the general situation of this realm. Wait patiently for the results."</p><p></p><p>Qing nervously asked, "Friend Xu..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai, looking helpless, said, "I have already mentioned it before. The attacks from the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals are fierce, with many small worlds falling one after another. The organization has decided to implement a survival plan, shrinking its power and only retaining valuable small worlds as core members."</p><p></p><p>"The final decision is not for Elder Liu alone to make. It requires an overall assessment by the organization's higher-ups before a decision is reached."</p><p></p><p>As evidence, Xu Bai also showed the images he had collected from the Tian Xuan Treasure Mirror of the successive defeats of the small worlds under the relentless assault of the cultivators of the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Faced with this scene full of slaughter, cruelty, and reality, the faces of the three individuals from the empire could not help but pale.</p><p></p><p>Handing them the images, Xu Bai reassured, "Rest assured, based on our shared ancestors, even if the organization's decision to protect you does not pass, I will secretly come to take you away and save your lives."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the number cannot be too many; five is the maximum."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai said with a somewhat serious expression.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the increasingly pale faces of Qing and the others, Xu Bai added, "Of course, if the organization ultimately decides to protect you, that would be even better."</p><p></p><p>"But as a condition, all resources and technologies in the empire must be integrated into our Union of Myriad Realms."</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of the outcome, you need to be prepared in advance during this period."</p><p></p><p>With a chuckle, Xu Bai looked at the Empress and said, "Remember, the empire only needs an emperor, not nobles."</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, let the empire have only one voice."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Xu Bai bowed slightly, "I have other matters to attend to and cannot stay here any longer. I hope to bring good news when I come next time."</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Qing and the others to bid farewell, Xu Bai flew away from the empire.</p><p></p><p>Watching Xu Bai leave, the Empress's gaze turned towards the outside of the palace.</p><p></p><p>A hint of murderous intent flashed through her eyes, gradually turning firm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Mysterious Yellow World, at the entrance to the empire.</p><p></p><p>Liu San, who had arrived first, was waiting for Xu Bai there.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, how was my performance?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Bai arrive, he couldn't help but ask proudly.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, I didn't expect Old Liu to look so upright, but he turns out to be adept at deceiving people without a flaw. I'll have to remind Elder Jiang to be careful in the future." Xu Bai said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Liu San's face immediately fell.</p><p></p><p>However, he quickly changed the subject, "Leaving that aside, this so-called small world of the empire is indeed quite remarkable. Not to mention anything else, just mentioning the 'Myriad Elements Furnace,' even in the ancient cultivation realms, it is quite extraordinary."</p>

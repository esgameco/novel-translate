            <p>"The cultivation technique you practice, I am fully aware of it. Although you can split your soul into millions, the one that can heal my injuries must be the most refined original soul. Website for new novel 69sux.com. Without you, your cultivation will also suffer a great loss!"</p><p></p><p>"I would never do such a thing!"</p><p></p><p>However, seeing Ji Yuzhen's still smiling face, Xuanyuan Hong couldn't help but reprimand her again.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he comforted her, "Zhen'er, don't worry, it's just a minor injury. I will retreat for a while to cultivate, and I will heal naturally."</p><p></p><p>Ji Yuzhen nodded silently, her gaze falling on Xuanyuan Hong, not moving for a long time.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside a grand hall.</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Hong, the King of Xuantian, sat at the head, surrounded by twelve Law Kings.</p><p></p><p>"In the last battle with the Heavenly Master Tian Du, although I suffered minor injuries, I also gained a lot from him."</p><p></p><p>"I will go into seclusion for a period of time. During this time, I will trouble all of you with the major and minor affairs of the sect!" Xuanyuan Hong said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"King of Xuantian, rest assured, nothing untoward will happen under our watch!" A Law King named Cui Lao reassured.</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Hong nodded, "If I succeed this time, I might be able to reshape my true immortal body in the mortal realm. By then, the plan to escape from the Dark Star Sea will also be greatly advanced!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as this was said, the faces of the other twelve cultivators showed various expressions.</p><p></p><p>There were those who were joyful and congratulatory, those who were indifferent, and those whose expressions were serious, revealing nothing of their thoughts.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In a dim secret chamber. New novel 69sux.com</p><p></p><p>"Zhen'er, I sense that someone seems to be stirring recently. The person who secretly contacted you before..."</p><p></p><p>"Go find him." Xuanyuan Hong's calm tone hid a hint of killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Ji Yuzhen was slightly startled but then realized, "Brother Xuanyuan, do you mean to lure them out?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Hong's face was stern, "Exactly! This is a great opportunity to deal with the Heavenly Master Tian Du as well!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Yuzhen's eyes lit up with some excitement, "Brother Xuanyuan, have you had a breakthrough already?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Hong smiled and nodded.</p><p></p><p>Ji Yuzhen took a deep breath, suppressing the excitement in her heart, "Alright, I have been deceiving that person all along. I will contact him as soon as I return."</p><p></p><p>"Good. Be careful in all things."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Blood splattered into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators screamed in agony before their deaths.</p><p></p><p>"Zhen'er, run away quickly..."</p><p></p><p>After receiving a message, Xuanyuan Hong's presence completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Ji Yuzhen flew towards the direction where she last sensed Xuanyuan Hong's presence. However, something abnormal seemed to have caught the attention of many other cultivators in that area.</p><p></p><p>Not only her, but the other Law Kings, as well as many other cultivators who had been misled by Tian Du, were all heading towards that direction without prior arrangement. Novel 69sux.com</p><p></p><p>Fighting and rushing at the same time.</p><p></p><p>"Younger sister, there are too many enemies! Find Brother Xuanyuan first, then discuss our long-term strategy!" Among the twelve Law Kings, a young cultivator named Zhou Yangli spoke with a grave expression through voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>Ji Yuzhen's unease grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the number of unscrupulous cultivators seemed to exceed her expectations. But if Xuanyuan Hong were here, none of this would be a problem.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the enemies and sweeping them away with his soul turning into a blue light, Ji Yuzhen hastened her pace once again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The scene abruptly came to a halt.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully rearranged everything, making sure that nothing was missed.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected that the surprise attack by the Ten Sects of Immortality back then was actually orchestrated by the King of Xuantian. He wanted to lure out the unstable elements within the Xuanhuang Realm and achieve his goal in one stroke."</p><p></p><p>"However, for some reason, at this critical moment, the King of Xuantian himself encountered an unexpected incident."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted his eyes, "If the information obtained from Ji Yuzhen's memory is correct, then the King of Xuantian had further advanced on the foundation of a semi-immortal body back then. Originally invincible in the Xuanhuang Realm, who could have been his opponent with that breakthrough?"</p><p></p><p>"The Ten Sects of Immortality? Heavenly Master Tian Du? Or..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the faceless stone statue flashed in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"This faceless statue was created by Xuanyuan Hong to show gratitude for the faceless true immortal who saved him in the Ascension Passage."</p><p></p><p>"From what can be seen now, the King of Xuantian Xuanyuan Hong is indeed a man of high integrity."</p><p></p><p>"But as for that faceless true immortal..."</p><p></p><p>"It's hard to say."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan analyzed to himself, "Saving Xuanyuan Hong's life with a casual gesture back then doesn't explain much."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps in the eyes of a true immortal, Xuanyuan Hong with a semi-immortal body is no different from an ordinary mortal. He might not have any value to offer."</p><p></p><p>"However, when Xuanyuan Hong consolidates his true immortal body, everything will change."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan speculated darkly about what might have happened back then.</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more it made sense.</p><p></p><p>Like he himself was approachable and amiable when facing ordinary people in Daxuan, but he was wary and different when dealing with court officials.</p><p></p><p>Understanding oneself and others, Li Fan thought that the faceless true immortal might also show different faces to different crowds.</p><p></p><p>And this theory also explained why the power behind the faceless statue did not care much about prayers from the Xuanhuang Realm and only transferred it to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"It seems even if I use the function of the faceless statue, it is safe for now. As long as I don't show any [immortal] power..."</p><p></p><p>Even though he reasoned out this speculation, Li Fan did not lower his guard against the faceless statue.</p><p></p><p>After all, the King of Xuantian could have fallen because of this statue.</p><p></p><p>How could Li Fan not feel apprehensive?</p><p></p><p>"Ji Yuzhen's memories are incomplete. Crucial moments, including her cultivation techniques, are not here."</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps, they are hidden."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked around at the floating flowers everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"The King of Xuantian mentioned that after cultivating the 'Limitless Heaven's Separation Divine Technique,' there is a difference between the myriad souls and the original soul."</p><p></p><p>"Now, the dispersed memories here are probably from Ji Yuzhen's many souls. What I obtained is just the scattered memories."</p><p></p><p>"As for the original soul hiding the truly important information..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan searched the circular mountain again, furrowing his brow slightly, "It's not here?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's hidden too deeply for me to discover right now."</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Li Fan reluctantly gave up.</p><p></p><p>But this also gave Li Fan some inspiration.</p><p></p><p>"With the information obtained here, combined with various insights from probing into Moru Bin's mind, it should be enough to pass off as a member of the ancient Xuantian Sect."</p><p></p><p>"If confronted, any subtle discrepancies can be explained by spiritual damage and memory loss."</p><p></p><p>"The only flaw is that the cultivation techniques of the Xuantian Sect cannot be replicated."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remembered the several cultivation techniques Ji Zhaojie had acquired in Sister Zhao's illusion realm.</p>

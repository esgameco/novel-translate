        <div class="content">
            <p>"At a glance, to extinguish the mysterious and yellow with the hunger character, I'm afraid only extraordinary immortal beings can achieve that. Sitting in meditation for ten thousand years, gaining enlightenment, it seems that breaking through to the realm of nameless true immortal is not far off..."</p><p></p><p>A sudden invisible pressure surged in Li Fan's heart.</p><p></p><p>If all that the Hundred Flowers Daoist said was true, then one day this immortal would awaken to enlightenment on his own.</p><p></p><p>If at that time, he still hadn't been able to escape from this darkest star sea...</p><p></p><p>He would have to face the truth.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the time he spent in the mysterious yellow realm actually had a limit.</p><p></p><p>However, for now, there was no need to worry too much about this issue.</p><p></p><p>At least in the several cycles he had experienced, up to anchoring for over seven hundred years, there were no signs of the immortal of Immortal Ruins awakening.</p><p></p><p>"But in that life, the obelisk that the Tianmeng built later began to erupt more and more frequently. Maybe it was because they sensed the crisis of the immortal's awakening and had to do so." Li Fan pondered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the awakening of the true immortal, what I should be more concerned about is, if I forcefully break through the attraction of the Immortal Ruins, leave the mysterious yellow, and even cross the high walls, will that immortal in enlightenment be awakened?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fan couldn't help but ask, "Let's set aside the source of the difficulties in the cultivation world. How do you view the invisible barrier surrounding the darkest star sea?"</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, the Hundred Flowers Daoist gave an unexpected answer. </p><p></p><p>"This invisible barrier actually has two possibilities."</p><p></p><p>"The first is the existence beyond the darkest star sea, established to prevent the spread of calamities brought by the seal characters of the true immortal."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly, which was consistent with the speculations of the Heavenly King at that time.</p><p></p><p>"As for the second possibility..."</p><p></p><p>The tone of the Hundred Flowers Daoist suddenly became solemn, "It is very likely to be set up by that immortal of the Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>"It has been said before, the true immortal paths pursued by each immortal are unique. That immortal who wishes to gain enlightenment through the hunger character, in order to prevent other immortals from discovering the existence of the [hunger] character and affecting their own enlightenment process. So before enlightening, he deployed methods to block and separate the interior and exterior of this star domain."</p><p></p><p>"The 'high walls' were set up by the immortal of Immortal Ruins?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was first shocked, then after pondering for a moment, he thought that it was indeed a plausible possibility.</p><p></p><p>He inexplicably recalled the judgment made by the Heavenly King at that time.</p><p></p><p>Only by breaking through to the realm of true immortality could one carry the mysterious yellow realm across the high walls.</p><p></p><p>"The true immortals mentioned by the Heavenly King, based on his rhetoric that he could quickly achieve, should be ordinary immortal realm, not the realm of nameless true immortality."</p><p></p><p>"Only with strength close to or surpassing the high walls set up by the immortal of Immortal Ruins can one cross them. This is also quite reasonable."</p><p></p><p>"When the immortal realm collapsed, the survivors scattered and fled. The immortal of Immortal Ruins, however, directly sat down to gain enlightenment at the entrance of the immortal realm passage after obtaining the 'hunger' character, this courage..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems to be quite rare in the immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>"So it may not be impossible for him to set up the barrier to block the entire darkest star sea."</p><p></p><p>In the reflection, Li Fan unexpectedly felt that the second speculation might be closer to the truth.</p><p></p><p>If that is the case...</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps trying to escape from the darkest star sea would inevitably disturb that immortal of the Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>This is undoubtedly more dangerous and unattainable than confronting the calamities.</p><p></p><p>But in order to achieve eternal freedom, who would have expected that just as he set out, he would find the necessary enemies - the Tianzun of the known laws and the immortal of Immortal Ruins - towering one after another on the path ahead...</p><p></p><p>How despairing this was!</p><p></p><p>Most cultivators in the darkest star sea, upon learning the truth, would likely have their hearts shattered, making it difficult to make further progress!</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan only narrowed his eyes, not feeling the slightest bit discouraged by this.</p><p></p><p>Whether it's the laws or the immortal. Even the mysterious and elusive 'nameless true immortal'...</p><p></p><p>As long as they stand in his way to eternal life, Li Fan will definitely crush them!</p><p></p><p>"On the road to immortality, I walk alone, resenting the obstruction of the world."</p><p></p><p>"With one sword breaking open the sea of stars, the heavens mourn, the earth wails, and the gods are shocked."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan chanted slowly in his heart, his eyes firm and resolute.</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Flowers Daoist nearby was unaware of what was happening, but she suddenly felt deep down that there was an inexplicable change in the aura of the person in front of her.</p><p></p><p>This made her feel a fleeting sense of fear, as if a great disaster was imminent.</p><p></p><p>However, this feeling flashed by only momentarily, and when she looked again, it had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if it was just her illusion.</p><p></p><p>But the Hundred Flowers Daoist understood that in her current state of 'Luli Body', illusions, hallucinations, and the like were impossible to appear on her.</p><p></p><p>So...</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Flowers Daoist stared at Li Fan, who seemed harmless and upright, but she became a bit more cautious in her heart.</p><p></p><p>The immortal of the Immortal Ruins was still far away from the current situation. After some contemplation, Li Fan temporarily suppressed various thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Hundred Flowers Daoist hidden in the golden light and asked again, "The realm of immortality is something we cannot speculate on at the moment. Compared to that, I am more curious about the Daoist's experiences."</p><p></p><p>"How are you related to the Dao child Luli?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze was sharp, and the array formations around silently reinforced once again.</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Flowers Daoist subtly glanced around, sighed, and said, "The precautions of the Dao friend are indeed remarkable."</p><p></p><p>"Actually, the reason I am in the Fishing Pool is just a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>"As I said before, I had no choice in the matter."</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Flowers Daoist slowly explained, "That day, we survivors from various realms were together, discussing ways to escape from the sinking star sea."</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, there was a mysterious fluctuation in the void, which locked onto me."</p><p></p><p>"In an instant, I lost consciousness, and by the time I woke up, I was already in the Fishing Pool."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled, "So you were just unlucky to be caught by the Fishing Pool?"</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Hundred Flowers Daoist sounded somewhat helpless, "Yes and no. The Fishing Pool automatically gathers treasures scattered in the starry sky. The rarer the ownerless item, the more likely it is targeted by the Fishing Pool."</p><p></p><p>"My cultivation technique is complete. I am like the dark light luli lotus, more like a treasure than a person."</p><p></p><p>"I can only say that it was destined for me to face such a calamity."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know how many cycles I have sunk in the Fishing Pool. Later, by a stroke of luck, I attached myself to a luli wisdom fruit with similar properties to me."</p><p></p><p>"After absorbing some of the fruit's energy, I could barely maintain my consciousness in the Fishing Pool."</p><p></p><p>"And then..."</p><p></p><p>"I sensed a force pulling the luli wisdom fruit, knowing that this might be the only opportunity to escape. So, I followed the luli, and we were both pulled out from the Fishing Pool."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, but I hid well, and none of you noticed all along."</p>

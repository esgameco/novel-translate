            <p>Li Fan also nodded: "Let's observe for a while before making a decision. During this time, it's better to create more End-Times Discs. If possible, it's best to try if it can affect the Mystical Sky Treasure Mirror. After all, such divine objects arouse my curiosity a bit too."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji's eyes lit up as he carefully examined an End-Times Disc in front of him and said thoughtfully, "Master, you don't have to say it. Both of these items are nurtured by the Mystical Sky Mirror, so it's indeed possible for them to combine. However, to achieve this, it's probably necessary to get hold of the Mystical Sky Treasure Mirror and conduct some research personally."</p><p></p><p>â€¦</p><p></p><p>While the Medicine King Sect and others were contemplating their future paths, more details about the conquest of small worlds within the Immortal Alliance gradually surfaced.</p><p></p><p>When a cultivator possessing the Mystical Sky Treasure Mirror discovers the entrance to a small world, they have two choices. One is to explore it alone first, and if they can dominate that realm independently, they can reap all the merit of that discovery. The rewards are unimaginably generous. Of course, if their own strength is not sufficient to overcome various obstacles encountered, they can choose to share the entrance to the small world. At that time, all holders of the Mystical Sky Treasure Mirror will be aware of the existence of this entrance and will flock to it.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the merit of "discovery and report," the first cultivator can also obtain a certain amount of merit and contribution from later cultivators. Although this proportion is minimal, when combined from many cultivators, it can still be a considerable wealth.</p><p></p><p>In any case, whether choosing to keep it all or share, the discoverer of the entrance to the small world will become rich overnight. This greatly encourages cultivators to engage in comprehensive exploration.</p><p></p><p>After the war of conquering the small worlds ends, the distribution of loot becomes even more exciting.</p><p></p><p>Any paradises discovered during this campaign will be announced in the Mystical Sky Treasure Mirror. As long as enough merit is available, one can directly exchange for ownership of the paradise! Moreover, the discoverer of the paradise or small world has the priority to purchase it!</p><p></p><p>This news stirred up the already restless cultivators, igniting them with excitement.</p><p></p><p>It is worth noting that in the current Xuanhuang Realm, reaching the Yuan Ying stage is a clear watershed. While the Golden Core stage can rely on personal comprehension, acquiring a Yuan Ying paradise depends on luck or connections. Among a hundred cultivators at the Golden Core stage, it's not certain that even one will achieve the Yuan Ying stage, indicating the level of difficulty.</p><p></p><p>And now, the Immortal Alliance aims to sweep across all corners to realize the unification of the Xuanhuang Realm. By then, all current paradises of the Xuanhuang Realm will be revealed. Luck and background will no longer be decisive factors. As long as you work hard enough, there's a chance to "seize the essence of heaven and earth and become Yuan Ying!"</p><p></p><p>An era where everyone can become Yuan Ying has arrived!</p><p></p><p>While excited, the cultivators also felt a sense of urgency. After all, everyone knows that the total number of paradises in the Xuanhuang Realm is fixed - it's first-come, first-serve. If you lag behind, you may lose the chance to achieve Yuan Ying in this lifetime. To think of breaking through again might require waiting for a Yuan Ying cultivator to fall so that new paradises can emerge!</p><p></p><p>Hence, a strange scene unfolded within the territory of the Immortal Alliance. Cultivators meticulously inspected every inch of land as if swarms of locusts passed through the area. From deep mountains, vast lakes, thick forests to swamps, no suspicious place was spared.</p><p></p><p>The once desolate wilderness was suddenly filled with the figures of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that people realized the surprising number of cultivators within the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, it didn't take long before the first small world not under the rule of the Immortal Alliance was discovered.</p><p></p><p>Named "Zhuo," it was a barren small world with only ordinary humans and devoid of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>The lucky one named Cheng Shi spent less than three days using the Mystical Sky Treasure Mirror to complete the world scan.</p><p></p><p>No one knew exactly how many rewards he had obtained, but after this incident, Cheng Shi directly purchased a separate courtyard in the Heavenly Luck City's residence district. He settled down there, no longer going out and focusing on cultivation, waiting for the release of paradises exchange by the Immortal Alliance to directly reach the Yuan Ying stage!</p><p></p><p>With such a live example before them, the cultivators became even more excited.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the second and third paradises or small worlds were discovered consecutively.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of the general euphoria of the cultivators, Xu Bai arrived at the Mystical Sky Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Generate a private version of the Mystical Sky Treasure Mirror?" the prompt sound of the Mystical Sky Mirror rang in his ears. Unlike the previously emotionless mechanical voice, it now carried a hint of liveliness.</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation, Xu Bai chose to proceed.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, a diamond-shaped crystal made from the End-Times Disc material was emitting a colorful light.</p><p></p><p>This was the initial plan suggested by Fang Zaiji after a brief study.</p><p></p><p>To prevent the Mystical Sky Treasure Mirror from scanning the content of his mind, the shielding function of the End-Times Disc was used to protect his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the diamond-shaped crystal would also disguise itself externally, continuously emitting various thoughts to ensure it wasn't detected by the Mystical Sky Treasure Mirror.</p><p></p><p>These outward thoughts were actively emitted and unrelated, deliberately allowing the Mystical Sky Treasure Mirror to sense them.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, a lock was added to his consciousness to prevent the Mystical Sky Treasure Mirror from prying.</p><p></p><p>After several trials, it indeed achieved the effect of protecting his consciousness. Fang Zaiji was currently researching methods for safeguarding the physical body.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Xu Bai quietly observed the changes in his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>As if an invisible wave passed through his body.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, a square and quaint bronze-colored small mirror appeared in his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The diamond-shaped crystal quietly floated above it, while the Mystical Sky Treasure Mirror remained completely unaware.</p><p></p><p>"It seems to be all right now," Xu Bai thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Upon contact with his consciousness, a plethora of information instantly surfaced. Consistent with what he had previously understood, all functions were fully available.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed convenient." With a thought, the map of the entire Immortal Alliance appeared in his mind. Moreover, he could clearly see four conspicuous red dots continually flashing on the map along with six tranquil green dots.</p><p></p><p>"The red represents the shared worlds by cultivators that are still in the process of conquest, while the green indicates worlds that have been explored," Xu Bai understood.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the Shi Linzhou location, which seemed untouched as per his memory, Xu Bai smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>After exiting the Mystical Sky Mirror, he headed straight to his destination.</p><p></p><p>Yes, he was going to the "Empire" created by Xu Ke!</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what treasures can withstand the conquest of the Xuanhuang Realm, and what price they are willing to offer?"</p><p></p><p>"And what will be their reaction when they see a body that completely resembles Xu Ke's appearance?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

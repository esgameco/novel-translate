        <h1>Chapter 892</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The black-robed cultivator was initially stunned, not understanding why the other suddenly brought up this matter.</p><p></p><p>But a moment later, he was slightly taken aback and uncertainly said, "Brother Zhan, do you mean that these two incidents were done by the same organization?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible?" The black-robed cultivator furrowed his brows, "To be able to kill the essence of the world without attracting the attention of the Immortal Alliance. This kind of power..."</p><p></p><p>The white-haired man surnamed Zhan smiled sarcastically, "Does Brother Xiang find it strange? The Stormwind Cave, your Xiang family also recently discovered it. How could this group of foreign cultivators know about it?"</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, just a Nascent Infant Cave is nothing special. The key is the ability revealed behind it, making people uneasy."</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the Immortal Alliance attaches great importance to this matter, to the extent that a law enforcer has come forward." The white-haired man's expression turned grave.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator was shocked, "This...how did it come to this?"</p><p></p><p>Initially somewhat arrogant in his tone, upon hearing the words 'law enforcer,' he actually became somewhat nervous.</p><p></p><p>The situation behind this matter had become unexpectedly deep, beyond his imagination.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xiang also knows that our father works in the Celestial Court. Therefore..." The white-haired man stopped there.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator nodded, constantly calculating in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Looking at his friend, the cultivator surnamed Zhan actually had some words he hadn't said yet.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Court was a mysterious organization within the Immortal Alliance specially designed to observe and supervise the essence of the world and the traces of the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Not officially listed in the organization's roster, only a very small number of cultivators knew of the existence of the Celestial Court.</p><p></p><p>The essence of the world involved matters of martial power.</p><p></p><p>Each one was extremely important, hence it was reasonable for the Immortal Alliance to monitor them.</p><p></p><p>Striving to include as many essences of the world as possible under the surveillance of the Celestial Court, the efficiency in recent years had been increasing. While it still couldn't achieve one hundred percent, almost one-third of the essences of the world in this world had been registered by the Celestial Court.</p><p></p><p>This was considered one of the most precious assets of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>However, this was actually just an incidental task of the Celestial Court.</p><p></p><p>The true responsibility of the Celestial Court was to constantly monitor the traces of the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Even though the laws of heaven and earth rarely changed over thousands of years, the Celestial Court still had to keep a close eye, without relaxing in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>The laws of heaven and earth, like a vast and complex network, composed the laws of the celestial realm.</p><p></p><p>If there were those who defied the laws of heaven and earth, they would become a part of this network.</p><p></p><p>The process of defying the laws would undoubtedly trigger movements in this network.</p><p></p><p>The higher the level of defiance, the stronger the movements.</p><p></p><p>Through this method, it was possible to observe whether a cultivator was defying the laws of heaven and earth and seeking immortality.</p><p></p><p>If such traces were discovered, the identity of the cultivator defying the laws had to be immediately investigated. If they were neutral cultivators, it was fine. But if they were from the Five Elders Association, every effort must be made at all costs to prevent their successful defiance.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Various thoughts regarding the Celestial Court crossed Zhan's mind.</p><p></p><p>He didn't actually have any favorable feelings toward the organization he was about to join, despite his father having emphasized the importance of the Celestial Court countless times in front of him.</p><p></p><p>After all, once you entered the Celestial Court, the next half of your life would be spent sitting dry in front of that apparatus.</p><p></p><p>Not even a day off in a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Such days...</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the appointment to the Celestial Court was not something he could influence.</p><p></p><p>Zhan looked at his friend beside him, feeling a hint of envy.</p><p></p><p>Being a local authority figure wasn't bad either.</p><p></p><p>But the black-robed cultivator named Xiang Ceng, who was known as Xiang, was unaware of his friend's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>After contemplating and hesitating for a while, he finally made a decision.</p><p></p><p>First, clarify the identity of the cultivator who stole the Stormwind Cave, but do not act rashly.</p><p></p><p>First, observe the situation on the Celestial Court's side.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Congyun Sea.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli, who had already returned to Haixuan Island, was initially unaware that he had attracted attention.</p><p></p><p>However, after dealing with various matters of the Mutual Aid Association, he received an anonymous message.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Ji, have you had a conflict with the Xiang family of Gather Tide Island? I see someone over there inquiring about you in secret."</p><p></p><p>His brows furrowed.</p><p></p><p>His only connection with Gather Tide Island was probably the recent devouring of the Stormwind Cave.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, he understood the possible reason for offending them.</p><p></p><p>After a brief search, Ji Shaoli felt somewhat relieved.</p><p></p><p>The Xiang family was just a local force of Gather Tide Island, with only one Dao Harmony expert in the family.</p><p></p><p>Even if they came looking for trouble, Ji Shaoli was not afraid.</p><p></p><p>"However, it's still necessary to make some preparations."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's gaze flickered.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Tianjian Sect, Sword Tomb.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who was immersed in comprehending, suddenly woke up.</p><p></p><p>Not because of the crisis his clone might face, but due to his inexplicable inability to perceive anything from the 'swords.'</p><p></p><p>Li Fan looked around.</p><p></p><p>He discovered that he wasn't the only one feeling like this.</p><p></p><p>The myriad of discarded swords in the Sword Tomb also seemed to have lost their connection to the 'swords.'</p><p></p><p>The slightly bent sword bodies returned to their straight form, appearing utterly lost.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan focused his gaze on the wooden sword in front of him, "Is it a change in itself? Has its spirituality disappeared?"</p><p></p><p>"No, this is temporary."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Li Fan noticed a clue.</p><p></p><p>Without acting rashly, he carefully observed the wooden sword, patiently waiting.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, just a moment later, the wooden sword once again regained its extraordinary aura as a heavenly sword.</p><p></p><p>Filled with the mystery of the sword, all the myriad swords in the Sword Tomb bowed down in reverence.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>What happened during that moment?</p><p></p><p>Continuing to study the sword way while waiting for the next 'malfunction' event to occur.</p><p></p><p>After several days of continuous observation, Li Fan also discovered the pattern within.</p><p></p><p>Every so often, the swords would temporarily lose their spirituality for a minute.</p><p></p><p>During this time, the myriad of swords in the Sword Tomb also lost their connection to the 'swords.'</p><p></p><p>But there was one exception!</p><p></p><p>Thanks to the presence of the Dao Stone in his mind, Li Fan could completely record and compare the reactions of each sword before and after.</p><p></p><p>Hence, he discovered this peculiarity!</p><p></p><p>Targeting the next 'malfunction' event, Li Fan leaped to its side.</p><p></p><p>It was an inconspicuous, dust-covered black sword.</p><p></p><p>Simple and unadorned.</p><p></p><p>There were no sharp sword edges or intricate patterns.</p><p></p><p>It looked like the first work of an apprentice blacksmith, so plain, even somewhat ugly.</p><p></p><p>But it was this sword that gained the favor of the wooden sword as a heavenly wonder of the sword.</p><p></p><p>The scene of the myriad swords bowing in worship in the Sword Tomb could be likened to a unified teaching session by the wooden sword.</p>

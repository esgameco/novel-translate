        <h1>Chapter 824</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Just by ensuring control over the life and death authority of the spirit tree through the Heart of the Spirit Wood, he finally relaxed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The pressure of the tree spirit continued to rise.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Infant, Divine Transformation...</p><p></p><p>Until it reached a level comparable to Harmonization, then it gradually stopped.</p><p></p><p>"The spirit of the giant tree is equivalent to the Tao of the Spirit Wood Realm."</p><p></p><p>"If the Tao indeed has a spirit, the Heavenly Cavern and Yuan Infant realms are equivalent. The miniature world varies based on its own scale, ranging from Divine Transformation to Harmonization."</p><p></p><p>"Originally, with the foundation of the Spirit Wood Realm, it was almost impossible for a tree spirit to be born with the power of Harmonization. However, due to the continuous influx of miraculous scenes by Shangtian, it has somewhat achieved a certain upgrade."</p><p></p><p>"Similar to Mr. Bai previously creating a miniature Golden Huang Realm out of thin air. However, Shangtian accomplished this through pure replication."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan pondered, the green light spots converging from all directions had stopped gathering.</p><p></p><p>A body almost identical to a human's appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Graceful curves, like the elder of the tree people, externally showing female characteristics.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced at her, his thoughts moved slightly, and through the Heart of the Spirit Wood, he dressed her in clothes.</p><p></p><p>The tree spirit did not resist.</p><p></p><p>Instead, she curiously inspected the clothes that suddenly appeared on her body.</p><p></p><p>Although her eyes seemed innocent, they were certainly not ignorant.</p><p></p><p>Inheriting all the memories of the spirit tree, she was born with innate intelligence, with the only thing lacking compared to ordinary cultivators being experiences of human interaction. (From a 69 book)</p><p></p><p>"Although her strength surpasses mine, due to me having long since assimilated the Heart of the Spirit Wood, she still must be under my control."</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Li Fan made the tree spirit kneel before him at his mere thought.</p><p></p><p>Kneeling to a Golden Dan at the Harmonization stage, regardless of the situation, was a great insult.</p><p></p><p>However, the tree spirit did not show any signs of anger.</p><p></p><p>"Master," she naturally addressed Li Fan in this way.</p><p></p><p>Creatures of the heavens and earth have simple nature, without the cunning of humans.</p><p></p><p>Especially when just born, they would not hide their emotions.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that the tree spirit's submission was her true intention, Li Fan nodded silently.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have taken human form, you should have your own name from now on."</p><p></p><p>"From now on, you shall be called Lin Ling."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Li Fan pointed a finger at Lin Ling's forehead.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a red mark appeared on her forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master." Lin Ling, now with her own name, was very happy, thanking Li Fan repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"She still lacks the concept of power hierarchy, so even though she calls me, whose strength is weaker, Master, there is no sense of dissatisfaction or rebellion."</p><p></p><p>"In the future, as she grows and experiences more, it may not be the same." (From 69 book)</p><p></p><p>"However, breaking free from the constraints of the Heart of the Spirit Wood is not an easy task."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully pondered the subtle connection between himself and Lin Ling, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Over the next period, Lin Ling showcased her strength as a being born from the Tao within the Spirit Wood Realm to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Capable of freely manipulating all the powers in the miniature world and always in the most efficient form.</p><p></p><p>With her help, the "transportation" process by Shangtian suddenly became much easier.</p><p></p><p>And Lin Ling did not feel like it was a tedious task; she played happily instead.</p><p></p><p>Her innocent and carefree expression deeply attracted the young man Shangtian.</p><p></p><p>As a being born from the Tao, Lin Ling's beauty naturally needs no explanation.</p><p></p><p>Perfect facial features with no flaws, her smiles exuded a unique charm.</p><p></p><p>Shangtian couldn't take his eyes off her, reluctant to look away.</p><p></p><p>"After... Senior," after Lin Ling finished her work and Li Fan let her play elsewhere, Shangtian found Li Fan, stuttering with a flushed face.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, very good." Li Fan patted Shangtian's shoulder firmly, revealing a meaningful smile.</p><p></p><p>He didn't promise anything but made Shangtian instantly feel as if he had been energized.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, the miraculous scenes stored in my Heavenly Views Gourd have been mostly replicated. So, I want to go record other things in the Golden Huang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Good, try to convince some others in Shanhe Xuan to come along," he volunteered.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his sense of initiative, Li Fan had no reason to refuse.</p><p></p><p>However, for safety reasons, he also gave Shangtian a jade pendant as a medium to perform the "Killing without Killing" technique.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he let him leave.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also slowly left the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, Lin Ling insisted on following him outside.</p><p></p><p>"You can leave here?" Li Fan couldn't help but be astonished.</p><p></p><p>"Master, don't worry, it's fine," Lin Ling reassured with a firm nod.</p><p></p><p>"However, it may not be as free outside as it is at home," she added.</p><p></p><p>As a free Helper at the Harmonization stage, Li Fan naturally agreed.</p><p></p><p>When the two arrived in the Golden Huang Realm, Li Fan immediately observed her changes.</p><p></p><p>"After all, there has been some influence, and in terms of actual combat power, she is somewhat inferior to a true Harmonization being," he silently nodded.</p><p></p><p>"However, she is still stronger than an average Divine Transformation." Li Fan concluded.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Ling in tow, they flew towards the direction of Jiushan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>After flying for a while, Lin Ling suddenly asked, "Master, why don't we travel underground? Flying in the sky is so slow."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Underground? What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling widened her eyes, looking at Li Fan. She opened her mouth, trying to explain, but couldn't find the right words for a while.</p><p></p><p>After a while, she suddenly tapped her head and transmitted a scene to Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Almost instantly, Li Fan understood what Lin Ling meant.</p><p></p><p>"Power of the earth veins?"</p><p></p><p>"You can shuttle through the Earth Vein's power?" he couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Master, can't you?" Lin Ling was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan fall silent, Lin Ling pondered for a moment, then comforted him, "It's okay, Master."</p><p></p><p>"I seem to be able to take you with me."</p><p></p><p>Feeling it out, Lin Ling seemed to be telling the truth.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan hesitated for a moment and then nodded slowly, "Let's give it a try."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, Master! Hold on to me tightly!" Lin Ling, excited at Li Fan's agreement, displayed great enthusiasm.</p><p></p><p>A green light shield appeared around them, and they plunged from the sky into the underground.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's vision went dark at first.</p><p></p><p>Then, it felt as if he was falling into a rushing river, surrounded by surging yellow energy.</p><p></p><p>The immense pressure even made Li Fan feel stifled.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Ling seemed to be as comfortable as a fish in water, not only able to move freely but also seemingly able to draw from the endless Earth Vein's power to strengthen herself.</p><p></p><p>Yelling along the way, they moved through the Earth Vein, flowing swiftly.</p>

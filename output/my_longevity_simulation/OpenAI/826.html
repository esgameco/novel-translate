        <h1>Chapter 826</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Not being able to achieve it is not due to technical reasons.</p><p></p><p>It is because, shuttling through the earth's veins, one will surely be attacked by the ancient trees of the earth's veins.</p><p></p><p>You should know, the three ancient trees still retain the memory of the time when the young trees were besieged by cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Although they do not hold as extreme hatred towards cultivators as the young trees do, their attitude will not be too friendly.</p><p></p><p>If they don't actively seek trouble, that's one thing, but when cultivators try to take advantage and overstep their boundaries, they naturally become unwilling.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was able to avoid the attacks purely because the other party considered Lin Ling's reputation.</p><p></p><p>And the ancient trees of the earth veins, rooted in the yellow earth.</p><p></p><p>A slight move can have a huge impact, and if one forces an onslaught against them, it might lead to a scene where the whole earth collapses.</p><p></p><p>When that time comes, it's uncertain how many cultivators will die instantly.</p><p></p><p>And with the existence of spatial teleportation technology, the demand for the power of the earth veins is not particularly valued.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, both the Ten Immortal Alliance and the Five Elders Association chose to turn a blind eye.</p><p></p><p>"In the future, communicate more with seniors." Li Fan looked at the earth veins branches in Lin Ling's hands and reminded her.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the withered branches Xi Mengyu found from the earth veins eruption, these earth vein branches were much more precious.</p><p></p><p>Apart from assisting Lin Ling and helping her grow more rapidly, with its help, one could instantly reach any location where the power of the earth veins spread.</p><p></p><p>Similar to Shang Tiansi's Heaven's Scene Gourd teleportation technique.</p><p></p><p>But Shang Tiansi needed to collect the strange scenes in the yellow terrain into the gourd one by one.</p><p></p><p>Here, the ancient trees of the earth veins had already spread their roots to every corner of the yellow realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that only Lin Ling can use it." Li Fan thought somewhat regretfully.</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling obediently integrated the earth vein branches into her chest.</p><p></p><p>After the little episode on the way, Li Fan then proceeded to the main task.</p><p></p><p>First, he set up a protective formation around him and temporarily hid Lin Ling.</p><p></p><p>Then he took out a jade talisman and crushed it.</p><p></p><p>A special wave spread out in an instant towards the Jiu Shan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes and waited.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, the Five Elders Association had been waiting for this wave for some time.</p><p></p><p>Before long, several figures flew speedily towards them.</p><p></p><p>One of them was none other than the spy from the Five Elders Association who Li Fan had contacted earlier, Yu Dayi.</p><p></p><p>It had been some time, and his cultivation had actually jumped from the Golden Core stage to the mid-Yuan Ying stage.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, it was all thanks to the information Li Fan had provided earlier. He had achieved great success and received a reward.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's figure from a distance, his face lit up with joy.</p><p></p><p>As he was about to approach, he signaled for the people around him to stop.</p><p></p><p>He approached alone to meet with Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"Long time no see, friend!" Yu Dayi greeted with a bow.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan glanced at him and chuckled, "It seems the information provided by our Universal World Alliance is somewhat useful."</p><p></p><p>"You're being too modest... " Yu Dayi chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, it seems your organization had also secretly helped us occupy the Jiu Shan Prefecture last time."</p><p></p><p>"Helping twice in a row, yet not asking for anything in return... " Yu Dayi looked puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"It's just to gain trust from your Five Elders Association." Li Fan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"I know that, even now, some people within your Five Elders Association still believe that the so-called [Universal World Alliance] is actually fabricated by the Ten Immortal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Sacrificing a little to deceive many..."</p><p></p><p>With these words, Yu Dayi's face suddenly became embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"Skepticism is normal. But it's okay. As our future cooperation becomes deeper, all distrust will eventually dissipate." Li Fan's tone was extremely confident as he let out a sinister laugh.</p><p></p><p>Yu Dayi did not pay much attention to the details, but upon hearing Li Fan mention "cooperation," his eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan did not disappoint him.</p><p></p><p>He casually tossed over a jade scroll.</p><p></p><p>After Yu Dayi received it, his eyes widened in excitement. He couldn't contain his joy.</p><p></p><p>"Another extraordinary achievement!" Yu Dayi was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan's next words poured cold water on him: "Although we can provide you with the secrets of the Ten Immortal Alliance's defensive formations that will render your defenses mere illusions, we, the Universal World Alliance, still do not recommend you launch a particularly large offensive right now."</p><p></p><p>"Even if you were to transfer enough power in a short time to instantly crush the resistance of the Ten Immortal Alliance, it's not advisable."</p><p></p><p>"Our suggestion is to wait a little longer." Li Fan's words carried deep meaning.</p><p></p><p>"Why is that?" Yu Dayi couldn't help but feel puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not answer directly but pointed his index finger towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Yu Dayi still seemed puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Go back and report my words. They will understand what I mean." Li Fan said tranquilly.</p><p></p><p>"When the time is right, we will inform you."</p><p></p><p>Yu Dayi opened his mouth to say something but refrained.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan then tossed another jade scroll over.</p><p></p><p>"Our Universal World Alliance has shown enough sincerity. Now it depends on the sincerity of your Five Elders Association."</p><p></p><p>Yu Dayi checked the list of items listed in the jade scroll and couldn't help but feel ecstatic.</p><p></p><p>"These are all a bit... "</p><p></p><p>"Just report it. As long as you're smart, I believe they will agree." Li Fan sounded extremely arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Yu Dayi discreetly glanced back at the five cultivators accompanying him.</p><p></p><p>They were ready to act at his command. With just one order, they could instantly capture this mysterious cultivator before them.</p><p></p><p>"Four Yuan Ying, one Nascent Soul."</p><p></p><p>"The other party is just a mere Golden Core."</p><p></p><p>"No matter how you look at it, the odds are in our favor."</p><p></p><p>Yu Dayi couldn't help but feel tempted.</p><p></p><p>"Just need to capture him and then use a secret way to turn him. We will learn more about the secrets of this Universal World Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Yu Dayi was almost about to give the order.</p><p></p><p>However, as he saw Li Fan glance at him with a look of confidence and a faint smile, a sense of uneasiness arose in him.</p><p></p><p>After much deliberation, Yu Dayi ultimately abandoned his plan.</p><p></p><p>The unpredictable aura emanating from the other party was one reason.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that, until now, the Universal World Alliance had been contacting the Five Elders Association unilaterally.</p><p></p><p>If something went wrong and they ended up offending them, it would be a loss that couldn't be compensated for.</p><p></p><p>After all, resources have value, while information is priceless.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, many thoughts flashed through Yu Dayi's mind.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he sighed with regret, bowed respectfully, and said, "Friend, come again in seven days. I'm sure we will give you a satisfactory answer."</p><p></p><p>"Alright! I hope your Five Elders Association doesn't act stupid. Otherwise, we might have to find new partners." Li Fan said as he clapped his hands.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Lin Ling, who had been hiding all this while, revealed herself.</p>

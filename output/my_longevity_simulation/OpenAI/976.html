        <div class="content">
            <p>"It is imaginable how profound the backgrounds of those who pass down the methods are," Mo Rubin sighed.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan couldn't help but visualize a scene.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Realm is like a piece of farmland, where cultivators are like crops growing one after another for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>The ordinary ones are harvested, while the true essence is carefully preserved by those who pass down the methods.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Wanxian League's trump cards seem endless, bringing surprises in every generation."</p><p></p><p>"This is just one branch of those who pass down the methods. In the Immortal League, there are also the Mirror Holders and the Illusionist Elders who are on par..."</p><p></p><p>"Compared to them, the Five Elders seem somewhat ordinary..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought to himself, then snorted, "They think of all cultivators as nothing, they deserve to be eradicated!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin nodded in agreement, "If the Xuantian King were to return, they all need to be eliminated!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not echo his agreement but pretended to be confused, "Xuantian King, Xuantian King..."</p><p></p><p>"So familiar a name..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan getting a bit bewildered again, Mo Rubin also felt helpless.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, it's just intermittent, not affecting the main matter. 新69書吧→69shux.com."</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Mo Rubin diligently "awakened" Li Fan again, giving him instructions on what to do if there are any further developments.</p><p></p><p>And then he left Li Fan's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Li Fan finally came back to his senses from the disguise.</p><p></p><p>"The method-passing Jiang should have returned to the origin with gray mildew. No wonder there hasn't been an attack yet, it seems to have been a close call."</p><p></p><p>"However, the nature of this method-passing Jiang seems to have transformed the immortal tool left in the Xuanhuang Realm, and there is currently no good way to defend against it. Even if we knew in advance, we couldn't be immune to its effects..."</p><p></p><p>Although Li Fan had the Xuanhuang Immortal Heart Charm to protect himself, the nature of the method-passing Jiang seemed to have directly changed his own attributes and qualities.</p><p></p><p>Instead of causing confusion in terms of consciousness and cognition in others because the protective effect of the Immortal Heart Charm was never triggered from beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>"Before the major calamity, all the immortal tools in the Xuanhuang Realm instantly disappeared without a trace. I never expected that some would transform into human beings."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting..."</p><p></p><p>Since it hadn't really been exposed, there was no need to act.</p><p></p><p>The plan for this lifetime still had to continue.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan did not relax his vigilance, his mind still connected to the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the method-passing Jiang was deceiving even his own people, this could be his strategy of causing suspicion?</p><p></p><p>Li Fan decided to observe a little longer.</p><p></p><p>What needs to be done now is just one word, wait. 新69書吧→69shux.com.</p><p></p><p>In the recent conversation with Mo Rubin, he mentioned the possibility of strengthening the Xuantian Locking Yin Formation and further pressuring the Xuantian Treasure Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Both he and Mo Rubin were not skilled in formations, and the group of people from the Wanxian League's Strategy Hall may not be reliable either.</p><p></p><p>So they needed external help.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps considering that there was still a need to repair the Floating Starry Sky Great Formation in the future, Mo Rubin contemplated for a while and found Li Fan's words reasonable.</p><p></p><p>After agreeing to go back, he decided to look for some treasures that could be used to derive formations.</p><p></p><p>"If I can absorb the Nine Disks Unification Disks again, my ability to derive formations will undergo a qualitative change once more."</p><p></p><p>"By then, I'm afraid I could easily break through the Death Reversal Great Formation as well. Perhaps by then, I can find the true identity of the Death and Life Celestial Venerable."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's plan to stay in the Spirit Wood Realm without moving was suddenly interrupted by a message from Lin Ling half a month later.</p><p></p><p>Although he was already a strong cultivator, Lin Ling's tone seemed panicked like a child, "Master... Master, Senior Shi... Senior Shi Ban has disappeared!"</p><p></p><p>"The small pond has disappeared too!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was shocked and immediately got up.</p><p></p><p>Senior Shi Ban and the Treasure Fishing Pond were both gone?</p><p></p><p>What's going on?</p><p></p><p>With a sudden worry in his heart, Li Fan was about to rush towards that mountain temple.</p><p></p><p>But when he recalled some of Lin Ling's previous behaviors, Li Fan abruptly stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>In a serious tone, he transmitted, "Why the rush! With Senior Shi Ban's strength, who in the Xuanhuang Realm could harm him?"</p><p></p><p>"Describe the situation in detail."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master." Lin Ling, still in a fluster, described the situation when the abnormality occurred.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that after Senior Shi Ban sat in meditation at the fishing pond to comprehend the Dao, he remained motionless like a statue.</p><p></p><p>However, as time passed, their courage grew.</p><p></p><p>Realizing that even when they got very close, it didn't provoke any reaction from Senior Shi Ban, they would occasionally gather around him.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to get a close look at this strange Senior Shi Ban.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Lin Ling was a little afraid, but being pulled by the young Dao disciple Liuli, she also found out that indeed nothing happened.</p><p></p><p>She became a bit more audacious.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Lin Ling, the closer you are to Senior Shi Ban, the more benefits you will get." The young Dao disciple Liuli sat on the ground, looking up greedily at Senior Shi Ban.</p><p></p><p>And Lin Ling also felt it, there was a different rhythm around Senior Shi Ban.</p><p></p><p>As if it could resonate with the other laws of heaven and earth, shortly after, many scenes naturally appeared sporadically in her mind.</p><p></p><p>Profound and involving different principles of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Even for her, a Dao-combining combat power cultivator, it was very beneficial.</p><p></p><p>"It was only later that I realized, Senior Shi Ban was at a crucial moment in comprehending the Dao of 'Fishing.' Therefore, it triggered a resonance of the principles of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>"But I was immersed in the benefits of comprehending the Dao at the time and didn't notice it."</p><p></p><p>"Until recently, the rhythm suddenly became turbulent. That feeling..."</p><p></p><p>"It's like a calm water surface suddenly stirring up huge waves!"</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of fear in Lin Ling's tone.</p><p></p><p>"It seems like there is something in the fishing pond exerting force as if pulling something. Senior Shi Ban, without any warning, was pulled forward a step."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, Senior Shi Ban's expression was very strange, showing both surprise and fear."</p><p></p><p>"It was as if there was an invisible thread tying him to something in the fishing pond. They were struggling against each other, neither willing to let go."</p><p></p><p>"And then..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling paused, looking terrified, "Suddenly, Senior Shi Ban seemed to be dragged into the fishing pond. He disappeared before our eyes!"</p><p></p><p>"Even more terrifying, we later found out that the Treasure Fishing Pond stopped functioning as well."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 795</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Mr. Bai's strength was able to avoid danger for a moment.</p><p></p><p>But ultimately, he couldn't avoid it in his lifetime.</p><p></p><p>After perfecting the "Foundation Building Technique" and successfully obtaining practical confirmation, the Divine Sage still found Mr. Bai based on some clues.</p><p></p><p>"Hum..."</p><p></p><p>As if the air was being instantly sucked dry, a huge pressure made everyone in the Medicine King Valley cover their heads in extreme pain.</p><p></p><p>In the sky of the secret realm, cracks began to appear.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if the secret realm itself couldn't bear the immense power and was about to shatter.</p><p></p><p>The Longevity Valley was like a small boat in a violent storm, swaying violently and on the verge of collapsing.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>All of this happened in an instant.</p><p></p><p>However, it was not actually the Divine Sage who appeared personally.</p><p></p><p>He only cast his gaze upon the sky.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai walked out slowly, flew into the air, and lightly stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>The cracks in the sky of the secret realm gradually healed.</p><p></p><p>The shaking Longevity Valley also slowly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Under the pressure from the Divine Sage, the people who had recovered all had pale faces and were trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Even the Three Members of the Heda, in front of the Divine Sage, were no different from ordinary Foundation Building or Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p></p><p>They looked at Mr. Bai, who single-handedly withstood the pressure from the Divine Sage, with different expressions.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai's clothes moved without wind, rustling.</p><p></p><p>"Take care of the children."</p><p></p><p>"They played an important role in the creation of the Foundation Building Technique."</p><p></p><p>Without looking back, he just gave this brief statement.</p><p></p><p>Then, Mr. Bai broke through the air and left the Longevity Valley.</p><p></p><p>"Sir!" From beginning to end, the people in the Longevity Valley never knew Mr. Bai's name.</p><p></p><p>They only called him "Sir."</p><p></p><p>Just like the group of orphans living in the ruined temple in Ningyuan City years ago.</p><p></p><p>As if zeroing in on the person they were looking for, the pressure from the Divine Sage gradually dissipated from the Longevity Valley.</p><p></p><p>Not vanished.</p><p></p><p>It was all concentrated on Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>After tearing through space and heading to the Xuanyellow Domain, it was unclear if it was because of the influence of the Divine Sage's power or if Mr. Bai intended it, but the sky of the Longevity Valley did not necessarily return to its original state.</p><p></p><p>Instead, a huge gap cracked open in the middle, allowing those present to see clearly what was happening in the Xuanyellow Domain at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai flew into the sky, his figure getting bigger.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, he became a giant standing like a pillar between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>With the target tracked, the Divine Sage did not say much either.</p><p></p><p>Dark whirlpools suddenly appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>They were like voids, releasing endless suction force towards Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like pairs of expressionless eyes staring fixedly at each other.</p><p></p><p>Due to the existence of the Devouring Elemental White Mist Barrier, only the Luoyan and Lueying provinces in the Xuanyellow Domain could witness the extraordinary events happening at that moment.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators gazing at the black whirlpools in the sky were momentarily dazed.</p><p></p><p>Even several people immediately flew towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Like moths to a flame, chasing the ever-changing black holes in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The attraction was nameless, but it seemed the temptation of the soul of heaven and earth towards the cultivators was even greater.</p><p></p><p>This was only the external manifestation of those black whirlpools.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Bai, who bore all of their power, began to distort slightly within a moment, with inexplicable explosions continuously occurring in different parts of his body.</p><p></p><p>Then, the astonishment that couldn't be held back by the children in the Medicine King Valley began.</p><p></p><p>An eerie purple color suddenly occupied the skies of the Luoyan and Lueying provinces in the Xuanyellow Domain.</p><p></p><p>Shrouding the sky, replacing the blazing sun.</p><p></p><p>Under the purple light, Mr. Bai's clothes, hair, and even eyes seemed to be tainted by the eerie color.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>A mass of flesh and blood burst from Mr. Bai's body.</p><p></p><p>Then, as if there was a phantom figure, inexplicably dissipated and returned to the sky.</p><p></p><p>If Li Fan were here at this moment, he would probably be able to see that this was the phenomenon of the falsified separation of the soul of heaven and earth from Mr. Bai.</p><p></p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p></p><p>The loud explosions continued to resound throughout the universe.</p><p></p><p>And the Divine Sage's follow-up was swift.</p><p></p><p>Countless thin black threads, like black earthworms, densely covered and gathered around Mr. Bai, voraciously sucking at him.</p><p></p><p>Lines of unknown numbers leaked from his body every moment, transforming into a part of their group by these wriggling black threads.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Divine Sage's actions had already surpassed the scope of ordinary spells and divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>There were no brilliant colors, no earth-shattering aura.</p><p></p><p>Only various elusive and abnormal "phenomena".</p><p></p><p>The cause of these "phenomena" must be a terrifying power that exceeded the cognition of the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators from the Luoyan and Lueying provinces who witnessed this scene all fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Facing the successive moves of the Divine Sage, Mr. Bai seemed to have no power to resist at all.</p><p></p><p>He just silently stood there, passively taking the hits.</p><p></p><p>Just when everyone thought so, Mr. Bai finally made a move.</p><p></p><p>He stretched out his hands, his long sleeves billowed, and in an instant, they penetrated into the white mist barrier before his body, cutting through the boundaries between the Luoyan and Lueying provinces of the Xuanyellow Domain.</p><p></p><p>"Boom! Boom! Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A huge dull sound seemed to surge from all corners of the sky and earth.</p><p></p><p>"What is that..."</p><p></p><p>"Quick, look, the white mist barrier is moving!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the cultivators noticed the abnormality and kept exclaiming.</p><p></p><p>The white mist barrier, silent for thousands of years and seemingly eternal, was actually slowly moving.</p><p></p><p>The booming sound became louder, the speed of the white mist flow increased.</p><p></p><p>And the source flowing was Mr. Bai's arms.</p><p></p><p>A huge suction force manifested from his hands.</p><p></p><p>Frenziedly drawing in all the Devouring Elemental White Mist that the cultivators dreaded into his sleeves.</p><p></p><p>From a trickling stream, it turned into a rapid river, then a roaring river!</p><p></p><p>The white mist covering the entire Xuanyellow Domain was continuously drawn into his sleeves, flowing rapidly towards Mr. Bai!</p><p></p><p>And this action seemed to finally truly anger the Divine Sage.</p><p></p><p>In the dark purple sky, a face faintly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Then, two fingers descended from the sky as if holding up the heavens!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the sky darkened.</p><p></p><p>The mournful howls akin to raging demon winds from the Nine Heavens resounded throughout the two provinces.</p><p></p><p>The wind and thunder resonated, space fissures crisscrossed like spider webs.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, extending from the sky to the earth.</p><p></p><p>Anyone unfortunate enough to be affected turned into ashes in an instant, leaving no bones.</p><p></p><p>Even those lucky enough to escape were trapped by the immense pressure brought by the two fingers descending from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Unable to move at all!</p><p></p><p>Some couldnâ€™t bear it and knelt down on the spot!</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p><p></p><p>Another chapter is being typed. It may take an hour or two!</p>

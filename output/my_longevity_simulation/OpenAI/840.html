        <h1>Chapter 840</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>A battle between cultivators and celestial beings took place on the scene.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, He Zhenghao was the first to make a decision.</p><p></p><p>He said in a deep voice, "I am willing to give it a try!"</p><p></p><p>"After all, I am just a small island guardian. There's nothing to lose by giving up!"</p><p></p><p>A rare excitement appeared in He Zhenghao's eyes, "Now with the help of the Mutual Aid Association, I have obtained the Yuan Ying technique in advance."</p><p></p><p>"The Golden Elixir realm is within reach, and capturing the Yuan Ying is just a matter of time."</p><p></p><p>"If I can reach the Golden Elixir realm and enter the central region of the Immortal Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>"The future prospects will be completely different from staying in the Congyun Sea!"</p><p></p><p>It seemed like he was trying to convince himself, as well as persuade the others present.</p><p></p><p>He Zhenghao's tone was firm and filled with provocative meaning.</p><p></p><p>With a leader stepping forward, three other cultivators made the same choice.</p><p></p><p>But that was the limit.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of people did not give up their comfortable positions and challenge their courage and confidence again.</p><p></p><p>After all, even if the real test questions were leaked...</p><p></p><p>But the contents in the jade slips given by Ji Shaoli were too much.</p><p></p><p>It was questionable whether they could remember everything.</p><p></p><p>There was a big difference between rote learning and truly mastering the content.</p><p></p><p>With the major exam approaching, the remaining time was too short.</p><p></p><p>It was not enough for them to prepare thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>In plain terms, the probability of success was not high.</p><p></p><p>However, out of the eleven, four were willing to take the risk.</p><p></p><p>This ratio was somewhat beyond Ji Shaoli's expectations.</p><p></p><p>He laughed and looked at He Zhenghao and the other three, clapping and praising, "Rest assured, you will never regret today's decision."</p><p></p><p>"Before the major exam, prepare on the island. I will provide necessary assistance for you."</p><p></p><p>The four were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>As for the rest, seeing Ji Shaoli's confident appearance, they couldn't help feeling some regret.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli, on the other hand, comforted the others in turn.</p><p></p><p>"Congyun Sea indeed needs everyone's care. It's also right to decide to stay here for development."</p><p></p><p>Finally, everyone felt at ease.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Tianlingzhou.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and his group of three had already returned near the entrance of the Wuxing Daoist Realm.</p><p></p><p>The earthquake in Qilingzhou had attracted the attention of the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>They did not alarm anyone along the way.</p><p></p><p>And the process of transferring the entrance of the Wuxing Daoist Realm was also done silently.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Hede cultivators were already at the peak of their cultivation, suitable for regular activities.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Ling and Tianyang working together, along with Li Fan's mastery of formations, it was easy to avoid detection by the cultivators in Tianlingzhou.</p><p></p><p>"Only the relocation of the entrance, moving it to the Lingmu Realm. It's not actually changing the position of the Daoist Realm."</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, there was still some danger involved.</p><p></p><p>"If discovered, the Lingmu Realm might be exposed because of this."</p><p></p><p>"However, as soon as I truly devour the Wuxing Daoist Realm, this hidden danger will naturally disappear."</p><p></p><p>The spatial data on Tianlingzhou had already been recorded.</p><p></p><p>Next, only one person needed to return to the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>In Lingmu Realm, the connection of the passage could be completed.</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't take long for Lin Ling to make the trip.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan inadvertently glanced at Lin Ling.</p><p></p><p>Since entering Tianlingzhou, she seemed somewhat distracted and absent-minded.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan asked through a message.</p><p></p><p>"Mistress..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Ling sounded somewhat panicked, hesitated for a moment, and then confessed in detail, "It seems that there is a bad aura here."</p><p></p><p>"It's somewhat similar to what the Senior Ancient Tree of the Earth Veins warned about, the mother tree that should be avoided as much as possible..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's heart skipped a beat at these words.</p><p></p><p>"若木 (Ruomu)?"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, this name appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>In the 115th generation, he had coincidentally encountered the incarnation of Ruomu in Tianlingzhou, the Decrepit Wood Daoist.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Ling could sense Ruomu's presence again, it was only natural.</p><p></p><p>However, what made Li Fan somewhat scared was this:</p><p></p><p>If Lin Ling could sense Ruomu, could Ruomu sense Lin Ling's presence?</p><p></p><p>A bone-chilling chill suddenly rose from his heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately ordered Tianyang to accompany Lin Ling and quickly leave Tianlingzhou.</p><p></p><p>They would return safely after ensuring Lin Ling's safety.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang immediately obeyed.</p><p></p><p>As the two left, Li Fan's fear gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>"The sense of crisis just now was not an illusion."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Lin Ling has indeed fallen into Ruomu's sight."</p><p></p><p>"However, it's unclear whether it was Lin Ling's good luck or for some other reason that she chose not to take action."</p><p></p><p>When Tianyang reported that they had safely returned to the Lingmu Realm, Li Fan finally relaxed.</p><p></p><p>After all, Ruomu and Mr. Bai were currently the only two beings he had encountered who could render him powerless.</p><p></p><p>"Being able to survive before was a stroke of luck."</p><p></p><p>"If there is a next time, the outcome might not be good."</p><p></p><p>"We should avoid such old monsters as much as possible." Li Fan pondered to himself while waiting for Tianyang's return.</p><p></p><p>Without the support of Lin Ling's Earth Vein power, Tianyang's journey alone took much longer.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, to avoid being detected by the cultivators along the way, he had to slow down his flight speed even more.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan patiently waited, a thought suddenly struck him.</p><p></p><p>"Ruomu holds grudges against cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"From time to time, she deceives and captures cultivators to be used as tools for creating Golden Elixirs."</p><p></p><p>"However, her incarnation as the Decrepit Wood Daoist does not frequently appear. At least in the 115th generation, when Simen Yuyu received my guidance and went to search for her, he did not find her trace."</p><p></p><p>"Ruomu appeared previously because of the outbreak of the great battle in Tianlingzhou, resulting in the deaths of countless cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"If she is appearing again now, does it mean that there will be another mass death of cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>"Even though it hasn't happened yet, she has sensed some clues."</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was lost in thought...</p><p></p><p>Tianyang finally arrived leisurely.</p><p></p><p>After some effort, the entrance of the Wuxing Daoist Realm was finally changed.</p><p></p><p>Only after the residual spatial fluctuations dissipated here did Li Fan leave.</p>

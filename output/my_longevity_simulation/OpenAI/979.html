        <h1>Chapter 979</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Under the transformation of the world, all these ordinary people are potential cultivators in the future.</p><p></p><p>And they are cultivators who can be used by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Now, it is almost one step away from creating a truly unified universe alliance. The only obstacle is the scarcity of techniques caused by the inability to cultivate the same methods.</p><p></p><p>Before capturing Yanfajue, Li Fan had already thought of a preliminary alternative plan.</p><p></p><p>That is the "Benevolent Spirit Technique" of the Lingyuan School from the past.</p><p></p><p>The more cultivators practicing this technique, the faster they will progress. This is enough to counteract the negative effects brought about by the inability to cultivate the same methods.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the respected master of the Fa-tiangua descended on Jiushan Town and flattened Jiushan in one glance.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the headquarters of the Lingyuan School was destroyed.</p><p></p><p>However, there are still Lingyuan School disciples who are aware of the "Benevolent Spirit Technique".</p><p></p><p>Since the number of cultivators practicing the Benevolent Spirit Technique has decreased sharply, the enhancing effect of the technique cannot counteract the negative effects of the inability to cultivate the same methods. Therefore, all these people have switched to different techniques.</p><p></p><p>The followers of the Red Dust Compassionate Immortal also had to spend some effort to inquire about the information of one of the hidden disciples.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Li Qing, a divine disciple, had quietly gone there and brought him back to be interrogated in the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Even if ordinary people cannot persist in the Blood River for long, if the small world cultivators go to fill the gaps..."</p><p></p><p>"In the end, all hidden histories will eventually be revealed. New 𝟨𝟫 Book→𝟨𝟫𝘀𝗁𝗎𝗑.𝖼𝗈𝗆"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts surged, and his gaze once again fell on the book of creation history.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if I want them to sacrifice for me, mere oppression is definitely not enough. I have to entice them with benefits..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking so, Li Fan formed hand seals and reconstructed the protective array covering the temple in the mountains.</p><p></p><p>Because the treasure of the Fishing Pond could not be moved, Li Fan had only set up a simple array here.</p><p></p><p>Although the Book of Creation History was also spontaneously hidden, its status was ultimately lower than that of the Fishing Pond.</p><p></p><p>And it cannot be ruled out that it may be forcibly moved by some old monsters of the Xuanyellow Realm if discovered.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, who already considered it as something in his pocket, certainly would not allow such a thing to happen.</p><p></p><p>A slight white light emitted from the final disintegrating disk in his mind, iterating to the latest formation pattern that Li Fan had arranged.</p><p></p><p>"Without new array data input, the derivational evolution speed of the disintegrating disk has reached a bottleneck."</p><p></p><p>"Either there is a completely new array, or we have to wait for news from Moru Bin, or the nine disintegrating disks of this world."</p><p></p><p>As the resources stored in the cave gradually depleted, the highest-level formation that the current final disintegrating disk could deduce also gradually descended into the world.</p><p></p><p>The level of the formation surpassed the Xuanyellow Realm of today by two whole generations. Compared to the defense great formation of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance, it was simply rudimentary like a child's toy. New 𝟞𝟡 Book→𝟞𝟡𝘀𝗵𝘂𝘅.𝐜𝐨𝐦</p><p></p><p>"This formation can be named the Endless Void Formation." Li Fan took a deep breath after finishing the formation.</p><p></p><p>The end, as the name suggests, has pushed the way of formations to the very end.</p><p></p><p>The Void represents the nature of the formation.</p><p></p><p>Drawing from the previous Forbidden Technique of "Hidden World Concealment" taught by the Heavenly Doctor, combined with countless hidden formations, the concealment ability of this Endless Void Formation may have reached the pinnacle of the Xuanyellow Realm. Where the formation covers, it can almost be said to form its own world.</p><p></p><p>Even if a cultivator of the Dao arises carefully investigates, it may not necessarily detect any clues.</p><p></p><p>As for the powerful beings in the Eternal Life Realm who only casually scan with their divine consciousness without careful inspection, the result would probably be the same.</p><p></p><p>In addition to its hidden function, the basic functions of protection and counterattacks of the Endless Void Formation are also present. However, compared to its concealment ability, they are slightly weaker, so there is no need to elaborate on all.</p><p></p><p>"All followers of the Compassionate Immortal in the Red Dust can face the River of Time. If they bring back a fragment of the passing time from there, they can receive the reward of becoming true immortals..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan had already concocted his words in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Now that the Empire and the Separation World Furnace have been set up, soon we can try to activate this plan."</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, those who work with the mind govern others, while those who labor with physical effort are governed by others. With a better and more efficient method, Li Fan naturally could not personally venture into the Blood River. Dispatching cultivators from various worlds to work for him was the right path.</p><p></p><p>"Revealing the lost history in the Blood River. This is called 'Heavenly Compensation.'"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was quite pleased to give this an extremely domineering name.</p><p></p><p>Just having the unparalleled formation protecting Li Fan on such an important site was not enough to put his mind at ease.</p><p></p><p>Summoning Tian Yang and instructing him to watch over here, Li Fan then left.</p><p></p><p>Of course, before leaving, he did not forget to remind Tian Yang not to try to observe the Blood River.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps only Tian Yang would not be curious about this and would not try to explore it recklessly.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yang just sat quietly on the ground, looking after the Book of Creation History as if in a daze.</p><p></p><p>He had no interest in the treasure that recorded all the history of the Xuanyellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Lingmu Realm, Zhong Shentong and Daotong Liuli, who had just arrived, were already astonished by the magnificent scenery of the headquarters of the Unified Universe Alliance.</p><p></p><p>And Lin Ling, who had not returned in a long time, was also very surprised by the changes in the Lingmu Realm.</p><p></p><p>When the female leader of the tree people, Lin Xin, appeared in human form in front of her, Lin Ling's expression was even more shocked, and a complex expression flashed in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I knew it, this little guy has indeed come up with some other ideas."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sneered.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't exactly be called rebellion, just some reluctance to submit to Li Fan and some rebellious thoughts in her heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, when she was initially influenced by Li Fan and willingly acknowledged him as her master, her mind was still naive and unclear. She did not have a clear understanding of the world.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Li Fan's strength was unknown compared to hers, and she sincerely and earnestly submitted.</p><p></p><p>However, over the years, she had been in constant communication with the Earth Pulse Ancient Tree, and her mind had rapidly matured.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan had not shown his true strength in front of her. In her eyes, Li Fan was just a slightly stronger Yuanying Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Having some ulterior motives was quite normal.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had long noticed this, which was also why he did not immediately go to her when he received her message.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan did not care about what Lin Ling was thinking.</p><p></p><p>As long as she had no betrayal behavior and continued to faithfully carry out Li Fan's orders, then everything was fine.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise...</p><p></p><p>With a cold laugh in his heart, Li Fan's figure flashed and he arrived at the central underground secret room.</p><p></p><p>"Have you not questioned him yet?"</p><p></p><p>The clone Li Qing's face was somewhat serious: "I did question him, but it's a bit strange."</p><p></p><p>"I cannot cultivate this 'Benevolent Spirit Technique'."</p><p></p><p>"It's not that it's ineffective, but I can't even get started." The clone Li Qing emphasized.</p>

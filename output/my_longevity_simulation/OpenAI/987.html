        <h1>Chapter 987</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Upon hearing this, Li Fan furrowed his brows fiercely, "You? Longevity realm?"</p><p></p><p>His tone was full of suspicion.</p><p></p><p>Although the opponent's strength indeed made him somewhat unsure, compared with the powerful longevity experts in the Xuanyellow world, there was definitely a big gap.</p><p></p><p>At least, Li Fan did not feel a significant threat from the other party.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, do you think that just by throwing out the title of Longevity Realm, you can scare me?" Li Fan's expression turned slightly unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoist sighed, "I have already fallen to this point; why would I do something meaningless."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, if I were still in Wansheng or even other immortal realms, I would indeed be worthy of the title of Longevity."</p><p></p><p>"But in the Xuanyellow world..."</p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoist looked up at the sky, a hint of awe flashing in her eyes, "Thousands of years have passed, and the world has changed so vastly."</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, my hometown Wansheng is only the size of five states in the Xuanyellow world today."</p><p></p><p>"And in our Wansheng realm, back in the day, we were still in the middle in terms of scale among the various immortal realms."</p><p></p><p>"Even for longevity experts, there are naturally differences." Baihua Daoist said somewhat helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>Back then, the Xuanyellow world was like a giant among many immortal realms. After thousands of years of continuous plunder and devouring, the Xuanyellow world had expanded significantly.</p><p></p><p>As possibly the only surviving immortal realm in the Dark Star Sea, the Xuanyellow world was indeed beyond conventional speculation.</p><p></p><p>In such a vast world, the Longevity Celestials who defied logic and coexisted with heaven and earth were naturally terrifying in strength.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't be reasoned with conventionally.</p><p></p><p>"Being born in Xuanyellow is truly both fortunate and unfortunate." Li Fan felt a certain way in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Baihua Daoist again, he estimated that her strength was equivalent to a slightly stronger level in the Xuanyellow realm.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder I thought you were a bit weak." Li Fan bluntly said.</p><p></p><p>"I have fought with the Longevity Celestials before. Friend, I estimate that you wouldn't last a few rounds against them."</p><p></p><p>Unable to gauge Baihua Daoist's expression, but from the gentle golden light emanating from her body, it was clear her mood wasn't good.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since what you said has been confirmed, let's return to the Spiritwood realm first. The Xuanyellow core realm is always under the surveillance of the Celestials. Although your strength may be slightly weaker, you are still a Longevity expert. If you stay for too long, there might be a risk of exposure." Li Fan said, taking Baihua Daoist back to the Spiritwood realm.</p><p></p><p>And Baihua Daoist didn't object.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the evenly matched strengths and the possibility of attracting even stronger adversaries through a fight, the key point was that Little Luli was still in Li Fan's hands. She was alone now, and her future cultivation would still need Luli's support.</p><p></p><p>"Baihua Daoist, can you contact the survivors from your various realms from back then?" In the Spiritwood realm, Li Fan changed his demeanor, speaking kindly.</p><p></p><p>"I know what you're worried about, but there's no need to fret. After so many years, those people probably have long been buried in the Immortal Tomb." Baihua Daoist's tone was icy.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Are you certain?" Li Fan asked with genuine interest.</p><p></p><p>"With the size of the Xuanyellow world in this realm, it is on the verge of falling into the Immortal Tomb. How long can those people hold on just with a small piece of land hastily put together?" Baihua Daoist said definitively.</p><p></p><p>"So apart from the Xuanyellow world, I have nowhere else to go now. I have no reason to conceal anything. Friend, you need not be so wary of me as if I were your mortal enemy." Baihua Daoist persuasively advised, feeling sorrowful about the unchanging hearts of those in the immortal realms.</p><p></p><p>"In their time, although there were inevitable deceptions, when did they ever need to be so cautious and vigilant as if to guard against mortal enemies every moment?" Li Fan remarked casually.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, human hearts are treacherous; one must be cautious." Li Fan seemed accustomed to such behavior.</p><p></p><p>"Words alone are not enough. Whether to let a friend go or cooperate, I am still not at ease..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Baihua Daoist thought Li Fan would still take decisive action and her body of golden light rippled slightly with agitation.</p><p></p><p>But as Li Fan's tone changed, "Friend, follow me. Just pay respects to the stone statue, and we will be comrades. From now on, we can work together harmoniously without suspicion." </p><p></p><p>Baihua Daoist was taken aback, "Stone statue?"</p><p></p><p>She looked puzzled until she saw the faceless true immortal stone statue, that puzzlement turned to fear.</p><p></p><p>Her golden light flickered incessantly, trembling as if she had seen an arch-enemy.</p><p></p><p>Stepping back, she exclaimed, "True immortal statue? How can such a thing be here?"</p><p></p><p>"You have been deceiving me all along?" Baihua Daoist stared at Li Fan, half in fear and half in resentment.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan keenly sensed that from the faceless true immortal stone statue, there seemed to be a subtle attractive force.</p><p></p><p>It wanted to absorb Baihua Daoist's golden light divine body.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you panicking, friend? This is the Compassionate True Immortal of the mortal realm, different from the other immortals you know."</p><p></p><p>"Just follow me and pledge, I'll ensure your safety!" Li Fan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, his mind connected with the stone statue, and instantly, the prayers of numerous Compassionate Immortal believers in the Xuanyellow realm all appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>He himself seemed to be blessed by a certain power.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt a faint golden thread detach from Baihua Daoist as it floated in the air, drawn towards him by the faceless true immortal stone statue.</p><p></p><p>"Golden wish power?"</p><p></p><p>After absorbing it, Li Fan realized that the nature of this energy was remarkably similar to the golden wish power, but purer.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze fell back on Baihua Daoist.</p><p></p><p>Under Li Fan's pressure, Baihua Daoist had to recite the oath with him.</p><p></p><p>After the oath, Li Fan's consciousness instantly sensed the existence of Baihua Daoist.</p><p></p><p>But she was no longer a human form emanating golden light but a lotus-shaped lamp.</p><p></p><p>"Is this your current form?" Li Fan furrowed his brow, asking.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Baihua Daoist's tone changed significantly, becoming very cautious.</p><p></p><p>"You are after all a Longevity expert, why are you so weak?" Li Fan was genuinely puzzled this time.</p><p></p><p>When this statement was made, Li Fan sensed a strong sense of grievance from Baihua Daoist.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the faceless stone statue quietly standing there, she hesitated in silence.</p><p></p><p>"But feel free to speak." Li Fan reassured.</p><p></p><p>"The Compassionate True Immortal, even though not at the level of Nameless True Immortal, is not far off. I am just a destitute Longevity expert; how could I resist?" Baihua Daoist weakly said.</p><p></p><p>"Even so, it's just a statue. Is there a need to be so afraid?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 833</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Not long after, Li Fan, who had already made up his mind, spent a hefty sum through his avatar Ji Shaoli's search efforts and finally found the answer.</p><p></p><p>"The Sky Patrol Arrow. One of the latest developments by the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance to counter the Five Elders' massive attack."</p><p></p><p>"The speed is unimaginable. It can circle the territory of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance and complete a patrol in just a day. It automatically locks onto suspicious targets, descends from the sky, and delivers a devastating blow."</p><p></p><p>"Below the Joint Dao realm, it can almost instantly kill. Even Joint Dao cultivators, if unprepared, will be severely injured on the spot."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully read the information about the Sky Patrol Arrow, looking solemn.</p><p></p><p>"The most crucial point is that this thing can be mass-produced. It is estimated that there are at least five Sky Patrol Arrows constantly patrolling the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance's airspace."</p><p></p><p>"During a war, it could probably launch dozens of arrows simultaneously, establishing absolute dominance in the aerial environment."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but furrow his brow.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Sky Patrol Arrow was indeed formidable. If it hadn't been for Tianyang and Lin Ling's intervention this time, he would probably have met his end then and there.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as a weapon of war, the Sky Patrol Arrow had immunity clauses.</p><p></p><p>In other words, if you were unlucky enough to be in the flight path of the Sky Patrol Arrow and get struck by it, unfortunately perishing...</p><p></p><p>No one would be held accountable for your death.</p><p></p><p>Dying would be in vain. (Link to a website)</p><p></p><p>"From what it seems, Oudaozi and his son have nothing to do with this Sky Patrol Arrow."</p><p></p><p>"They just predicted the trajectory of the Sky Patrol Arrow, intending to take advantage of it to escape while causing harm."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Understanding the general situation, Li Fan began his own plan.</p><p></p><p>Oudaozi and his son probably never imagined that Li Fan's retaliation would come so swiftly.</p><p></p><p>And with no regard for reason!</p><p></p><p>In just three days, an image spread throughout almost the entire Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The unimaginable content in the image not only greatly shocked numerous cultivators of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance but also stirred up feelings of murderous intent and greed.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Li Fan had given up on the idea of personally seeking out Oudaozi and his son.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he directly exposed the matter of them possessing rare treasures to the public!</p><p></p><p>Following the norm, human nature is always greedy and selfish.</p><p></p><p>When one finds out that the other party possesses a supreme treasure, they will surely try every means to make it their own, whether by scheming in secret or seeking help, or even selling the secret for a good price...</p><p></p><p>In short, this matter should have remained within a small circle.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan didn't play by the rules at all. (Link to a website) Without any hesitation or greed, within a few days, he made sure everyone knew about the matter!</p><p></p><p>To outsiders, Li Fan's actions truly seemed detrimental to himself.</p><p></p><p>There were countless cultivators in the world! Even if the secrets on Oudaozi and his son changed hands, they would certainly no longer be related to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Just to vent one's frustrations, he even gave up the opportunity to profit from it...</p><p></p><p>It was truly unwise, almost crazy behavior.</p><p></p><p>Actually, Li Fan would never have done this if it hadn't been for Huanzhen.</p><p></p><p>But since Huanzhen existed, he wasn't in a rush for anything.</p><p></p><p>"The kid is indeed troublesome. Let the Alliance cultivators scout for me and see if there are any good plans to capture him."</p><p></p><p>"In the next life, I'll mimic this strategy." Li Fan's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>And Li Fan's plan could be said to have been quite effective.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the future, reversing time!</p><p></p><p>As long as anyone saw the abilities displayed by Oudaozi and his son in the image, they couldn't help but be excited, wanting to make those abilities their own!</p><p></p><p>In no time, there was a frenzy within the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance to find Oudaozi.</p><p></p><p>Several families even offered high rewards. Anyone who provided information on Oudaozi and his son's whereabouts would receive hefty rewards in the highest Joint Dao technique.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you can run, with the world so vast, there will be no place for you to hide." Li Fan, who orchestrated all this, looked at the cultivators who were gradually descending into madness, thought of the somewhat mocking expression of Oudaozi's son, and coldly snorted.</p><p></p><p>When almost the entire Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance came together to carry out a task, how terrifying would their efficiency be?</p><p></p><p>The 115th era's exploration of the White Mist and the small world of the Heavenly Caves had long since provided the answer.</p><p></p><p>Less than five days after the image was released, Oudaozi and his son, hiding in the deep forest, were found by someone.</p><p></p><p>Although they managed to escape by devious means, they were again found after revealing themselves.</p><p></p><p>Once exposed, while evading the pursuit of the Alliance's cultivators, the chase and blockade drew nearer, and their capture was imminent.</p><p></p><p>During this process, their abilities and information were gradually probed.</p><p></p><p>Oudaozi's son was named Oushangtian.</p><p></p><p>Predicting the future and reversing the course of events were all personal abilities of Oushangtian.</p><p></p><p>Currently, it was highly likely that they originated from a companion artifact of Oushangtian.</p><p></p><p>As for predicting the future, it was different from initial speculation: Not every detail of the future could be foreseen. It seemed that Oushangtian would only sense it when his life was under a great threat.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, he could foresee countless ways of his own demise.</p><p></p><p>Thus, he could avoid calamities and find a way out.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the reversal of time, it aligned with Li Fan's conjecture. It didn't truly alter time but reversed the state of objects and energy to a certain point in time. During this process, a mysterious connection could be formed between himself and the object.</p><p></p><p>For example, Oushangtian had once reversed dozens of attacks launched against him.</p><p></p><p>He even learned the abilities of one of the attacks, annihilating the group of cultivators besieging him and making his escape.</p><p></p><p>However, the power to reverse time couldn't be used limitlessly. After each release, Oushangtian had to rest for some time before being able to continue utilizing it.</p><p></p><p>After the truth came to light, many cultivators were greatly disappointed and gave up pursuing Oushangtian.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, although these two abilities were formidable, there was still a considerable gap compared to the imagined power to reverse time.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, a significant number of cultivators continued their pursuit.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the past, any cultivator possessing such talents had been absorbed by major powers and held in high regard. This opportunity to kick a man when he was down was indeed rare.</p><p></p><p>Knowing Oushangtian's specific abilities, during the subsequent pursuit, the cooperation among cultivators was extremely tacit.</p><p></p><p>When planning, they refrained from going all outâ€”only seeking to capture him alive.</p><p></p><p>This approach made Oushangtian's predictive abilities partially ineffective.</p><p></p><p>Rather than attacking simultaneously, they employed a prolonged guerrilla warfare strategy, depleting Oushangtian's power to reverse time...</p><p></p><p>Gradually, Oushangtian found it increasingly difficult to flee.</p>

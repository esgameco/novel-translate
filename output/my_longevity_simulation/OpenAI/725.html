        <h1>Chapter 725</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In terms of the understanding of the struggle against the laws of heaven and earth and the pursuit of longevity, Li Fan's current knowledge is still too shallow. He can almost only analyze and judge based on the different historical evolutionary directions of the Xuanhuang Realm he has experienced. He can only glimpse the surface and cannot grasp the essence.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps only when he truly reaches the realm of defying laws can he truly understand what is happening in the Xuanhuang Realm during this time.</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was pondering, a consensus was also reluctantly reached by Emperor Fu and Dongfang in their dispute.</p><p></p><p>One should not act recklessly just because of the resurrection means of the "Hall of Rebirth". One still needs to cherish their own life.</p><p></p><p>But if one has sufficient resources, it wouldn't hurt to purchase some treasures such as Qinghun Ding and Edict of Rebirth as a last resort. After all, life and death are unpredictable, and no one can guarantee that they will not suddenly fall due to unforeseen circumstances. It is always better to be prepared than not.</p><p></p><p>"The appearances of those resurrected cultivators are still a very small number. I really don't know what kind of impact it will have on the Xuanhuang Realm when a large number of fallen cultivators are reborn eighteen years later," Emperor Fu sighed.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what it will become in the future, but it is obvious that the day when the White Mist Barrier is completely explored is not far off!" Dongfang Yao said with a cold snort as another Pure Virtue Ferry flew quickly past him.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li, if you want to exchange for the 'Endstone Tablet', you may need to hurry up," he reminded.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost time, after completing one more maze, I will have reached one hundred thousand Qingxuan points. The new 69 novels, com." Li Fan nodded, carefully distinguishing the voice coming from deep within the white mist, constantly adjusting the direction of advancement.</p><p></p><p>As they delved deeper into the white mist, on this day, Li Fan once again captured the sound of the "Heavenly Physician."</p><p></p><p>However, this time, the voice seemed somewhat strange compared to usual. It was as if something was disturbing and distorting the transmission of the sound, making it almost unrecognizable as the "Heavenly Physician." If Li Fan had not been shuttling through the mazes during this time and heard the "Heavenly Physician's" cries too many times, he probably would not have been able to discern it.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan did not act rashly.</p><p></p><p>When Emperor Fu and Dongfang saw Li Fan stop, they quickly asked for the reason.</p><p></p><p>After some explanation, Emperor Fu and Dongfang agreed in unison, "We have weathered many storms, so even if there is danger, there is no need to fear. Besides, we can still be resurrected now. Brother Li, don't worry, let's move forward."</p><p></p><p>It seemed that although they said there were suspicions about the resurrection and needed to be cautious, they had much more confidence in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>After all, being able to resurrect was a relief!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since both of you say so, let's explore this maze." Li Fan said solemnly, then manipulated the flying boat to swiftly fly in the direction from where the distorted sound came.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, as if crossing an indistinguishable boundary, the Pure Virtue Ferry suddenly stopped without any signs.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong, Brother Li?" Emperor Fu and Dongfang looked at Li Fan somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"It wasn't me." Li Fan explained.</p><p></p><p>The three of them exchanged glances, their faces becoming serious.</p><p></p><p>After scanning the surroundings with their divine senses and finding no abnormalities around the flying boat, nor any reason for it to stop inexplicably, Li Fan pondered for a moment, took out the "Black Death Talisman" to protect himself, and flew directly out of the Pure Virtue Ferry.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to circumnavigate and see for himself what was going on outside.</p><p></p><p>There were no discoveries above, front, back, or sides.</p><p></p><p>But when Li Fan flew to the bottom of the ship, the scene he saw made his pupils constrict.</p><p></p><p>A long, black sticky substance, like long tentacles, emerged from the white mist below, with their ends sticking to the bottom of the Pure Virtue Ferry.</p><p></p><p>This black unknown substance seemed alive, making a "rustling" sound as it slowly expanded and crawled around the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could even hear them "crawling" on the bottom of the boat.</p><p></p><p>"What is this..."</p><p></p><p>His divine sense was completely blocked, so he had to rely on his naked eye to distinguish it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan flicked a flame with his fingers, trying to burn the black tentacles sticking to the hull.</p><p></p><p>However, to his astonishment, the flame seemed not to be in the same space as them, regardless of how vigorously it was ignited, it could not affect the black tentacles in the slightest. Li Fan then released a sword aura, but it was the same. It was as if they didn't exist at all, as the sword light passed directly through the black tentacles and flew into the distance.</p><p></p><p>The sticky black substance still clung tightly to the hull, showing no signs of breaking.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan remained engrossed in his actions, a fluctuation of spiritual energy was emitted. Emperor Fu and Dongfang couldn't sit still, flew out of the boat, and saw this eerie scene.</p><p></p><p>They tried various methods but still couldnâ€™t sever the black tentacles.</p><p></p><p>"Let's follow it downwards to see where it is coming from," Emperor Fu suggested.</p><p></p><p>He then took out the Tianyuan Mirror to shield above his head.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, we have entered a new realm inside, which no one else has yet set foot in," he said with a hint of joy.</p><p></p><p>"But with three Pure Virtue Ferries as backup, it's better not to use them until we figure out what this thing is. Otherwise, if we get entangled again, we might have to fly out of the white mist with our bodies," Dongfang Yao advised.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan gave the two of them reassurance, "It's okay, I still have plenty of Black Death Talisman left. Even without the Pure Virtue Ferries, relying on the talisman should be enough to safely return us."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Fu and Dongfang praised, "Brother Li has everything well-planned."</p><p></p><p>With no worries, the three of them immediately decided to follow the long black tentacles and explore downwards.</p><p></p><p>The flight was not fast, but the unexpectedly long sticky black substance took the trio the time it would take to finish a pot of tea to find its source.</p><p></p><p>When facing the scene before them, the three of them were speechless.</p><p></p><p>A huge black spherical mass, like a tumor, hung silently in the air.</p><p></p><p>It was also formed by countless black sticky substances.</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred tentacles shot out from the flesh ball, flying in different directions into the white mist, sticking to something unknown.</p><p></p><p>At first glance, it looked like a black aerial giant net, enveloping the circular black ball in the center.</p><p></p><p>"Can you sense its presence with divine sense?" Emperor Fu asked nervously, transmitting his voice with divine sense.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan closed his eyes. In his perception, there was nothing ahead. When he opened his eyes, the black circular ball reappeared in his sight.</p><p></p><p>"I can't," Li Fan shook his head slightly, his face serious.</p><p></p><p>"Let's forget it. Let's not disturb this thing. Let's finish exploring this realm and then retreat." This strange scene made Dongfang Yao, who had always been brave, also become a little uneasy, so he suggested.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan gazed at the black spherical mass for a long time and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Something that can block divine sense perception is definitely not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Better be cautious.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

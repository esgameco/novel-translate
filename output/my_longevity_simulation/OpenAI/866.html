            <p>However, the current Li Taishi already possessed powerful combat skills. Additionally, he had many powerful abilities such as the seven-colored jade virtual brilliance.</p><p></p><p>He was no longer the "Huanzhen" who could easily be intimidated by a few words from others.</p><p></p><p>Even if the other party was the Longevity Heavenly Venerable!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan decided...</p><p></p><p>to further investigate the other party's background!</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Fan pretended to be a little confused and somewhat surprised, "Beyond the Transcendentalist realm? What does that have to do with me?"</p><p></p><p>The slate scholar smiled and said, "Since you refuse to admit, then let us take a look at the records about you in the slate."</p><p></p><p>A burst of green light emerged from behind the slate.</p><p></p><p>The breath of the vicissitudes of time emanated from the scholar. Various images began to surround the two and appear.</p><p></p><p>It was like falling into the long river of history, scenes from the past in the Transcendentalist realm unfolded like a scroll.</p><p></p><p>The scholar let out a muffled groan, and his body began to swell.</p><p></p><p>His face and the clothes on his body inexplicably kept changing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>At times, he was a handsome scholar, at times a sturdy woodsman.</p><p></p><p>At times, he transformed into a charming young woman.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes not even a human being.</p><p></p><p>But a tree, a flower.</p><p></p><p>Birds in the sky, beasts on the ground.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Only the slate behind him remained unchanged, with an eternal green light.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the images surrounding the light screen gradually stabilized.</p><p></p><p>A bright light emerged, and it was Li Fan reflected in it!</p><p></p><p>However, there was no scene of him flying out of the Great Transcendentalist, or even the scene of him coming through the spatial passage to the Transcendentalist realm and directly heading to the Tianyang Cave to subdue Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>He was only shown bringing Tianyang into Shilinzhou.</p><p></p><p>Finding the entrance to the Spiritwood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Entering and exiting, then capturing Shang Tiangi in the Taihua State underground.</p><p></p><p>In the Taihua State, he found Mr. Bai's secret room.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the Spiritwood Realm, he brought out Lin Ling with his combined Dao strength.</p><p></p><p>First, he completed a transaction with the Five Elders, then headed directly to the Wuxing Grand Cave in Tianlingzhou.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The scenes kept changing.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan's vigilance in his heart instantly relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"Just as I thought."</p><p></p><p>"The Creation Slate records everything that happened in the Transcendentalist realm down to the smallest detail. However, it is only the original Transcendentalist realm!"</p><p></p><p>"You should know that the current Transcendentalist realm is a fusion of the original Transcendentalist realm and countless caves, small worlds, and even fragments of many other immortal cultivation realms!"</p><p></p><p>"For these outsiders, the Creation Slate may not necessarily have records!"</p><p></p><p>The scholar further explained using a house analogy. </p><p></p><p>The original Transcendentalist realm was just like a single small house.</p><p></p><p>But after all these years of expansion by countless cultivators, the Transcendentalist realm had become much larger.</p><p></p><p>The Creation Slate inside the original small house had complete recording authority.</p><p></p><p>But for these other places, the Creation Slate had lost the ability to record!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The images continued to change, intermittent as Li Fan had expected.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, the places where he frequently appearedâ€”Congyun Sea, Spiritwood Realm, and Wuxing Grand Cave...</p><p></p><p>were not within the recording range.</p><p></p><p>So basically, it showed him always on the move without stopping.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder, what flaw led this scholar to come for me?"</p><p></p><p>The scene presented on the slate was approaching the present time.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the duplicate Jishao Li appeared in the image.</p><p></p><p>The scene abruptly halted the moment he entered Yongyunzhou.</p><p></p><p>After leaving Yongyunzhou, Jishao Li went straight to the Spiritwood Realm.</p><p></p><p>The picture darkened, then showed Li Fan advancing to the Nascent Soul stage, coming out of the Spiritwood Realm and swiftly flying through the states using his seven-colored divine light.</p><p></p><p>"Was it the seven-colored divine light that caught his attention?" Li Fan couldn't help but think.</p><p></p><p>The scholar's following words confirmed his guess.</p><p></p><p>"I actually don't care about the authenticity of the World Union. What I'm more interested in is where you obtained this seven-colored divine light," the scholar said as he gazed at Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"The power of this item is not something that can be nurtured within the remaining states. It can't be a divine ability I grasped myself, can it?" Li Fan asked in return.</p><p></p><p>The scholar chuckled in silence.</p><p></p><p>"I possess the Creation Slate, so I'm very familiar with the aura of splendor emanated by your seven colors. It's almost like concentrated power of a world's heavenly dao. If you have such abilities, then you wouldn't be the one questioned today; it would be you questioning me," the scholar said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Although there was no tone of mockery, Li Fan couldn't help but snort at the scholar's expression and tone.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's non-response, the slate scholar continued, "Rest assured, I won't snatch your belongings. This seven-colored divine light may be strong, but to me, it's just a burden."</p><p></p><p>"What I truly want to know is the place where the seven-colored divine light was nurtured," the scholar openly admitted.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, "What do you mean? How do you know that the seven-colored divine light was produced by something? Can't it just be a single treasure hidden in the Yongyunzhou?"</p><p></p><p>The scholar sighed.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding light screen suddenly turned pitch black.</p><p></p><p>Then, a bit of seven-colored light appeared suddenly.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, it was incomparably dazzling and prominent.</p><p></p><p>The scholar looked at Li Fan, "Do you understand now?"</p><p></p><p>"Such treasures, as long as they exist in this world, whether or not someone has refined them, will be like this."</p><p></p><p>"Some people thoroughly searched the Transcendentalist realm. Apart from that Heaven Transcendence Mirror, there are currently no more treasures on the realm artifacts."</p><p></p><p>"So, your seven-colored divine light must have recently appeared..."</p><p></p><p>At these words, Li Fan's expression turned somewhat unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that this seven-colored divine light, as strong as it was, would be so glaring in the eyes of a true powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>As for the scholar's question, Li Fan pondered how to respond.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>Putting on a look of great difficulty, after much struggle, he finally sighed, "I knew I couldn't hide this forever."</p><p></p><p>"Elder, please follow me to see for yourself."</p><p></p><p>With that, he awakened Lin Ling, who had been in a daze the whole time, and who had been observing quietly on the side.</p><p></p><p>Then, they drilled into the ground and headed straight for Yongyunzhou.</p><p></p><p>Inside the earth's veins, the slate scholar casually followed behind, not in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Li Fan was amazed.</p><p></p><p>But he thought to himself, "No wonder in the previous life, even though he had treasures like the Fishing Pond, Zhu Shen Tong still didn't guard them. Instead, he wandered around everywhere."</p><p></p><p>"It's probably because after he left Yongyunzhou and exposed the seven-colored divine light, this slate scholar discovered clues and came knocking on his door."</p><p></p><p>"Forced to give up ownership of all treasures."</p>

            <p>Li Fan's heart suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, my guess was correct! The first thing he did after his resurrection was to get his hands on 'Huan Zhen.'" Judging others by oneself, Li Fan's spiritual sense was frantically warning him.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the powerful experts equivalent to countless combined strengths, they would soon come knocking at his door.</p><p></p><p>Facing the pressure like a dark cloud looming over the city, the immense oppression almost made it hard for him to breathe.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he forced himself to calm down.</p><p></p><p>His mind worked to the utmost with Dao Stone crystals, contemplating whether there were any overlooked preparations on his part.</p><p></p><p>But he also knew that in front of a huge gap in strength, all calculations would ultimately depend on luck!</p><p></p><p>"My fate shall not be extinguished!"</p><p></p><p>At the critical moment of life and death, with no Huan Zhen to rely on.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, however, felt his tension gradually dissipating, and his mind became clear.</p><p></p><p>All distracting thoughts vanished.</p><p></p><p>He calmly pondered possible strategies.</p><p></p><p>"Although I have lost the synchronicity with Saint Embryo Xu Bai, this kind of 'loss' may just be a one-way, simple blockade."</p><p></p><p>"It is entirely possible that Mr. Bai can still sense the situation on my end through his clone Xu Bai, or even contamination from his original body."</p><p></p><p>"So the first step is to get rid of the clone Xu Bai, attempting to sever and weaken the connection between him and me."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, any plan would be transparent in front of him."</p><p></p><p>"And next..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan frowned, deducing and considering various possibilities of what might happen next. [New 69 Book Bar -> 69shuix.xom]</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was awaiting Mr. Bai's arrival.</p><p></p><p>However, it seemed that Mr. Bai's arrival was slower than expected.</p><p></p><p>Nearly the time it would take for an incense stick to burn had passed, yet his figure was still nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he went to find Dongfang Yao first to deal with the potential threat from the 'Legacy Images'?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts raced, but upon checking, he found Dongfang Yao and the Legacy Images were unharmed.</p><p></p><p>"Then where did he go?"</p><p></p><p>A hint of doubt flashed in his mind.</p><p></p><p>But soon, he vaguely guessed a possibility.</p><p></p><p>Believing that with Mr. Bai's current strength, he could easily pierce through space restrictions and arrive in Changsheng Valley in an instant.</p><p></p><p>However, it should not be forgotten that the Transmitting Celestial Sovereign was on the top of the dome, observing and monitoring the Xuanyellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Such a conspicuous act was tantamount to voluntarily exposing oneself.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Mr. Bai might have chosen to approach slowly in a way that would not attract attention, like "walking slowly."</p><p></p><p>Of course, this "slow pace" was in comparison to "teleportation."</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, it should be soon." Li Fan sat upright in the central meditation chamber.</p><p></p><p>And the clone Xu Bai quietly arrived at the entrance of Changsheng Valley.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's speculation was correct.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the sealed space passage suddenly opened.</p><p></p><p>The disciples guarding it were astonished.</p><p></p><p>When they went to inspect, they found that no one had actually arrived.</p><p></p><p>A sense of confusion lingered.

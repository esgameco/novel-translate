        <h1>Chapter 972</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Don't talk about millions of cultivators, even if all the cultivators in the Xuanhuang Realm were put together, it might not be able to surpass the legacy," the young man who appeared very shy immediately regained his composure after being surprised. With a light cough, he kindly reminded.</p><p></p><p>"Well..."</p><p></p><p>"It does make some sense. After all, it's a presence that has been suppressing the entire Xuanhuang Realm for thousands of years..."</p><p></p><p>Seemingly convinced by the young man, Li Fan's arrogance disappeared from his face and became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"But there's no need to be overly afraid of him."</p><p></p><p>"If he really pushes me to the edge, I can just awaken the Xi Xu Immortal in the immortal domain, and we'll all perish together!"</p><p></p><p>To the young man's surprise, Li Fan, after a brief moment of calm, turned the conversation coldly.</p><p></p><p>And the content of his words made the legacy holder's face change drastically.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Realm, very few cultivators knew about the existence of the Xi Xu Immortal.</p><p></p><p>And even fewer knew that a true immortal resides in the Xi Xu Immortal.</p><p></p><p>He was not clear about the Five Elders Association, but at least among the legacy holders of the Wanxian Alliance, only he knew about this.</p><p></p><p>It was the Legendary Legacy Saint who personally told him about it that year.</p><p></p><p>And now...</p><p></p><p>The legacy holder Jiang stared at the unremarkable cultivator in front of him, his thoughts racing as he speculated about the man's background.</p><p></p><p>"Being able to know such a secret, he must have had contact with the power above the Longevity Realm. New 69 novel. SheHux .com"</p><p></p><p>"The Mystical Art of the Xuan Heaven, inherited from the immortal realm. It should be one of the remnants of the Xuan Heaven Sect."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that even after so many years, the Xuan Heaven Sect still lingers around. And it's even possible that it has infiltrated the higher-ups of the Wanxian Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>As he pondered, the legacy holder Jiang induced Li Fan, "Unless absolutely necessary, don't choose to destroy everything."</p><p></p><p>"After all, reaching this point was not easy. It would be a waste to give up so easily!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan also nodded in agreement, "After planning for more than seven years in this world, it would be a shame to abandon it just like that."</p><p></p><p>The legacy holder Jiang was once again startled, "Planning for more than seven years for this matter?"</p><p></p><p>"Only seven years?"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible?!"</p><p></p><p>"When did the Wanxian Alliance become so easily infiltrated?"</p><p></p><p>The legacy holder Jiang was furious in his mind, yet he once again observed the cultivator in front of him, while dismissing his suspicions.</p><p></p><p>"All living beings are like me," not some technique or supernatural power. It was the supreme characteristic he was born with.</p><p></p><p>Any living being that made contact with him face to face would recognize him as "themselves."</p><p></p><p>Cautiousness, secrets, defenses, all the various emotions that others would have towards someone, wouldn't arise when facing him, the legacy holder Jiang.</p><p></p><p>If his life was threatened, he would instinctively protect himself, just as he would guard his own safety.</p><p></p><p>After thousands of years in the Xuanhuang Realm, the legacy holder Jiang had not seen anyone who could be immune to this characteristic.</p><p></p><p>Even the Legendary Legacy Saint from back then was no exception!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could he sit securely in the position of the top legacy holder with his ordinary strength and talent?</p><p></p><p>Indeed, this ability was incredibly formidable. For him, there was no one in the world who could be his match. If he wanted, he could even uncover the secrets of everyone else one by one.</p><p></p><p>If there was any weakness, it was only within the level of being "like me".</p><p></p><p>Rather than "for me".</p><p></p><p>Indeed, almost all creatures wouldn't have any defenses against themselves.</p><p></p><p>But if there were doubts about the authenticity of the "I" played by the legacy holder Jiang, they would launch attacks against him.</p><p></p><p>That was how the Legendary Legacy Saint had exposed him.</p><p></p><p>So, he could only slowly manipulate conversations through various means. Directly asking questions that went against the common sense of that "original me" could potentially expose him.</p><p></p><p>Despite this limitation, over the years, with this extraordinary characteristic, he still remained invincible. Those who could truly see through him could be counted on one hand.</p><p></p><p>Other legacy holders were aware of this ability of his. Even if they were on guard, they simply couldn't resist it.</p><p></p><p>They could only treat him with respect from a distance.</p><p></p><p>And for the overall order of the legacy holders' group, he self-exiled into a blank small world called the "Return Ruins," overseeing many matters of the Wanxian Alliance remotely.</p><p></p><p>Although the cultivator in front of him was mysterious and unpredictable, it was obvious that he couldn't escape the influence of his inherent characteristics.</p><p></p><p>"What he said should all be true."</p><p></p><p>"Seven years, seven years..."</p><p></p><p>The legacy holder Jiang quickly sifted through all the major and minor matters that happened in the Wanxian Alliance during these seven years in his mind, attempting to find the mole named Mo Rubin.</p><p></p><p>But the other party had obviously changed their name, leaving him clueless.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that we have to find a way from this person."</p><p></p><p>In the midst of the legacy holder Jiang's rapid thoughts, he echoed, "Right, seven years of effort is nothing much. But if we miss this chance, it's hard to say how long we'll have to wait for another opportunity to start over."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, no problem. With 'Huanzhen,' as long as it's achieved once, it can be replicated countless times..." Li Fan was speaking confidently when he suddenly stopped mid-sentence.</p><p></p><p>He stared at the legacy holder Jiang, his expression seemingly unchanged.</p><p></p><p>But the legacy holder Jiang keenly sensed that the atmosphere around them had shifted somehow!</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Where is the flaw exposed?"</p><p></p><p>"'Huanzhen,' in hand, able to replicate countless times the schemes that have been previously realized?"</p><p></p><p>"What is 'Huanzhen'?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be a treasure left behind by the Xuan Heaven Sect?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless thoughts flashed through the legacy holder Jiang's mind.</p><p></p><p>But he also understood that he seemed to have exposed himself. Deciding not to conceal it any longer, he tried to ask, "What is 'Huanzhen'?"</p><p></p><p>"What is 'Huanzhen'?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>These words echoed repeatedly in Li Fan's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>A gaze devoid of any emotion locked onto the legacy holder Jiang.</p><p></p><p>Then, suddenly, the millions of gods and demons that were rampaging and destroying in the Xuanhuang Realm all returned in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Evil energy surged, and the demons reappeared!</p><p></p><p>The face of the legacy holder Jiang slightly changed as he tried to sever the connection and leave the consciousness.</p><p></p><p>But it was already too late.</p><p></p><p>All the millions of gods and demons let out earth-shattering roars towards the legacy holder Jiang.</p><p></p><p>Their roaring voices united into one, aiming to crush the legacy holder Jiang with the momentum to destroy everything!</p><p></p><p>Amidst the attack of the millions of gods and demons, a faint, inconspicuous seven-colored divine light flew out.</p><p></p><p>It collided with the intentions of the legacy holder Jiang.</p><p></p><p>At the moment of contact, the seven-colored divine light quietly dissolved, injecting a trace of gray mold into the consciousness of the legacy holder Jiang.</p>

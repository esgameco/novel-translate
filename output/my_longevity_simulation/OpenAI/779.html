        <div class="content">
            <p>许白 is supervising Fang Zaiji to reinforce the Medicine King Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>"Master, we have already added a sufficient amount of rare materials. I estimate that when the Medicine King Cauldron was first forged, they did not use this many precious materials."</p><p></p><p>"It does seem a bit wasteful."</p><p></p><p>"Are you planning to use it to resist the attacks of the Eternal Life Heavenly Respect?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji said with some heartache.</p><p></p><p>However, under the determined and decisive gaze of Xu Bai, he still threw a small cluster of Eternal Fire Essence Gold into the fire in front of him.</p><p></p><p>As he manipulated it with all his strength, it took more than ten days of intense burning before the Eternal Fire Essence Gold finally loosened slightly and deformed.</p><p></p><p>Then, with careful manipulation of his thoughts, he embedded and fused it into the surface of the Medicine King Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>He then took out some black powder and handed it over.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji breathed a sigh of relief when he saw what Xu Bai had in his hands, but was startled again.</p><p></p><p>"Why can't my divine sense perceive this thing?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai smiled faintly, "If your divine sense can't detect it, then that's correct. Please cover the Medicine King Cauldron with this material as requested. If it's not enough, I have more here."</p><p></p><p>"This thing that can shield divine sense perception must be quite expensive," Fang Zaiji muttered, following Xu Bai's instructions.</p><p></p><p>The ground fire kept jumping, reflecting Xu Bai's expression that remained uncertain.</p><p></p><p>Three thousand feet underground, Li Fan, who had quietly returned, dug out a secret chamber, sealed the surroundings, and covered it with formations.</p><p></p><p>Then, he took out a metal furnace and placed it on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"The Wanxiang Smelting Furnace."</p><p></p><p>"Although it may not really be able to smelt the [Emperor One Beast], the appearance of such a powerful monster in the Xuanhuang world will certainly attract Senior Brother Zhang's aspiration avatar."</p><p></p><p>"And, I no longer need to consider how to control it after smelting the [Wanxiang Ancestor Beast]."</p><p></p><p>"It's better to be more crazy. It saves a lot of trouble."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>The Wanxiang Ancestor Beast naturally required a variety of exotic animals.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Li Fan had them here.</p><p></p><p>Not from the empire's visit this time, but from the first trade with Xiao Qing in this world.</p><p></p><p>It was the [Seal of Life Treasure Box].</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took out a small red square wooden box.</p><p></p><p>Although palm-sized, it was divided into tens of thousands of different spaces inside.</p><p></p><p>Each space was frozen with a different exotic animal.</p><p></p><p>"Let's start with the weaker ones first."</p><p></p><p>Following the method taught by Xiao Qing, Li Fan made a move in his mind and took out several dozen palm-sized exotic beasts from the treasure box.</p><p></p><p>The moment they left the frozen space, they began to regain consciousness.</p><p></p><p>With a slight shake of Li Fan's spiritual power, these exotic beasts were killed before they could react.</p><p></p><p>Their flesh and blood were disintegrated into the smallest particles in an instant, maintaining their original appearance but being thrown into the metal furnace by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>As if recognizing the entry of the exotic beasts' flesh and blood, the intricate exotic animal patterns around the furnace gradually lit up.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that when the empire forged this thing, they also referenced information about the supreme treasure of the Beast Control Sect, the [Myriad Beasts Revolving Wheel]..."</p><p></p><p>"The Beast Control Sect is hidden in the Ethereal Spirit Realm, it's not known when it will be discovered by the Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered as he took the exotic animals from the Seal of Life Treasure Box and put them into the Wanxiang Smelting Furnace.</p><p></p><p>As the number of exotic animals being added increased, Li Fan felt a mysterious power emerging within.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but become somewhat serious.</p><p></p><p>Ten days later, both Li Fan and his clone Xu Bai suddenly stopped their actions.</p><p></p><p>A strange expression appeared on their faces at the same time.</p><p></p><p>"Is the infant formed successfully..."</p><p></p><p>"But how can it be such an inconspicuous Daoist cave?"</p><p></p><p>Just now, Senior Embryo Xu Bai roamed the Xuanhuang Region and finally felt something.</p><p></p><p>He found a Daoist cave that was most suitable for himself.</p><p></p><p>Even ordinary single-attribute Daoist caves were far inferior.</p><p></p><p>This Daoist cave was only the size of a palm, surrounded by dark chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>There was only a barren yellow land standing in the void, allowing one to stand in it.</p><p></p><p>Sharing the same divine sense, Li Fan could clearly feel that this Daoist cave indeed had nothing special about it.</p><p></p><p>Senior Embryo Xu Bai chose it solely because it was recently born.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting. I can see how Mr. Bai will succeed in completely transforming it with a new method."</p><p></p><p>"When the changes in the world come, how will you choose?"</p><p></p><p>While preparing for a desperate move in the dark, Li Fan split out a conscious demeanor to carefully observe Senior Embryo Xu Bai's "natural" behavior.</p><p></p><p>Senior Embryo Xu Bai transformed a divine shadow, standing on the barren yellow land of the newly born Daoist cave.</p><p></p><p>Without any aversion, he had a slight joy on his face.</p><p></p><p>He personally created water, moistening the barren land.</p><p></p><p>Then a faint green light flew out from him.</p><p></p><p>Before long, some green seedlings emerged from the ground.</p><p></p><p>The first thread of vitality appeared from the Daoist cave.</p><p></p><p>After that, a graceful stream began to surround these plants.</p><p></p><p>With abundant vitality, the Daoist cave began to expand into the surrounding void.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan watched all these changes thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"Creating a completely new Daoist cave from scratch."</p><p></p><p>"But tailored entirely to one's own ideas. It is indeed better than going out to seek by chance."</p><p></p><p>"But Daoist caves are not like ordinary people. Their growth cycle is counted in thousands or tens of thousands of years. And that's under the most ideal conditions."</p><p></p><p>"In this world, I've had the infant for so long, but the Five Elements Daoist caves are still in their infancy. This shows how difficult it is for Daoist caves to grow."</p><p></p><p>"Do you have to wait for it to grow slowly?"</p><p></p><p>"For me, that's good news."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought so.</p><p></p><p>He was caught off guard and felt a bit urgent in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After forming the infant, Senior Embryo Xu Bai walked leisurely in the Xuanhuang Region.</p><p></p><p>After stopping in a certain region, he reached out lightly towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Then, something mysterious seemed to happen between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>As if something was drawn out by Senior Embryo Xu Bai out of thin air and then put into his own Daoist cave.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>There were constant rumblings within the Daoist cave.</p><p></p><p>A mountain and river rose in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Daoist cave, changes were occurring at a speed tens of millions of times faster than usual.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"Extracting Heavenly Essence?"</p><p></p><p>"So effortlessly, without any worries about the backlash of heaven and earth. Moreover..."</p><p></p><p>Watching this scene, Li Fan's eyes suddenly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>What made him even more horrified was that Senior Embryo Xu Bai walked to the next region, observed for a moment, and then acted again.</p><p></p><p>- End of chapter -</p><p></p><p>There will be another chapter updated tomorrow at noon. This world is coming to an end, and it requires careful consideration.</p><p></p><p>Please vote with power stones; the double power stone vote will continue until the 7th of next month.</p>

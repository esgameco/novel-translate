        <h1>Chapter 991</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"By the way, I'll hand over that exotic treasure to you."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I've recently felt that someone is watching me, so I have to be careful."</p><p></p><p>After receiving the location information from Moru Bin, he suddenly disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sensed the map points emerging in his sea of consciousness, silent and thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a test? Or a trap?"</p><p></p><p>Since making the decision to "just observe the form, not reveal the truth for now," Li Fan had been feeling uneasy.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how much he thought about it and discerned his own self, he couldn't find the source of his unease.</p><p></p><p>"It should be fine to temporarily not reveal the truth, after all..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual sense had always been very accurate. The feeling he had now was like walking in a dense forest, moving in the right direction without the danger of wild beasts attacking for the time being.</p><p></p><p>But an impending crisis sensed in the depth of his being told Li Fan that there was something he was neglecting.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew that the source of unease must be related to the faceless True Immortal Stone Statue.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuantian Divine Statue, Xuantian Law King..."</p><p></p><p>Mo Ru Bin's figure flashed through Li Fan's mind, and he made a decision.</p><p></p><p>"Although he probably already sees me as one of his own, I can't afford to drop my guard. Let's just see what happens."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan recalled the scene of Mo Ru Bin devouring the Law Transmissioner Feng.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Li Fan had also made a preliminary analysis and speculation about Mo Ru Bin's abilities.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Zhao Shijie's "Unity in Diversity," Mo Ru Bin seemed more like "Mirror, Assimilate."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can maintain my true self and not be seduced by that illusionary mirror, I should be able to delay assimilation. With my Seven-Colored Divine Light and the protection of the Immortal Heart Mantra, I should be able to resist, and even escape if needed."</p><p></p><p>"If things really go south, I can release Baihua Daoist to divert the attention. Being in the Longevity Realm, he should be able to hold out for a while."</p><p></p><p>The persistent feeling of unease, which he couldn't shake off and whose cause he couldn't pinpoint, made Li Fan's thoughts more complex than usual. Consequently, he became even more cautious.</p><p></p><p>After making sufficient preparations, Li Fan quietly arrived at the agreed location.</p><p></p><p>At the border of the four central states of the Immortal League, in a nondescript mountain peak in Tianchen Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The stone mountain towered high into the sky, hidden beneath the clouds, with an inconspicuous stone cave on its slope.</p><p></p><p>Narrow at first, only for one person to pass through. After a few dozen steps, it suddenly opened up.</p><p></p><p>Mo Ru Bin had been waiting inside for a long time.</p><p></p><p>There was no formation or restriction outside the stone cave, but from the outside, there was no sign of any cultivator inside.</p><p></p><p>It was not until he stepped into the stone cave and stood in front of Mo Ru Bin that he finally noticed.</p><p></p><p>"This is Feng, the Law Transmissioner's safe haven, a naturally formed hidden paradise of heaven and earth. It's the kind of place that legends say is invisible to those without fate. You and I meeting here poses no danger." Mo Ru Bin had reverted back to his original appearance, sitting in front of a stone table, and explained slowly.</p><p></p><p>"What safe haven? I didn't encounter any obstruction at all and just boldly walked in." Li Fan snorted, showing disdain.</p><p></p><p>Mo Ru Bin smiled, "Brother Xingwang, you are unaware of something. The reason it was so easy is because I had already informed you of the location of this hidden paradise beforehand. If you had come searching alone without knowing anything..."</p><p></p><p>"Your divine sense wouldn't be able to detect it, and even if you saw it with your own eyes, you would subconsciously ignore this entrance, searching in vain! The marvels of heaven and earth, even with our strength, there are things we cannot fully understand!"</p><p></p><p>Ignoring Mo Ru Bin's sigh, Li Fan impatiently interrupted, "Alright, enough of these useless talks. Where is that exotic treasure that can derive formations?‚Äù</p><p></p><p>Mo Ru Bin shook his head and then casually threw an object over.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan caught it and was slightly startled.</p><p></p><p>The result was somewhat different from what he had expected; it wasn't one of the Disintegration Discs but a green cube he had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>"What is this thing..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan lightly touched the cube, and in an instant, it disintegrated into thousands of smaller cubes.</p><p></p><p>As if alive, they gathered and dispersed in the air, forming orderly patterns.</p><p></p><p>Observing one of the small cubes carefully, Li Fan found it composed of hundreds of combined formations.</p><p></p><p>"Formation Crown?" a name involuntarily appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't expose the fact that he knew about it, just stared at Mo Ru Bin, waiting for an answer.</p><p></p><p>"This is the 'Impersonal Formation Crown,' discovered and submitted by the Lingcangzhou Branch of the Immortal League not long ago."</p><p></p><p>"The so-called Formation Crown is simply stacking hundreds or thousands of formations together. This Crown of Impersonality is constantly evolving from a normal Formation Crown through variations and derivations."</p><p></p><p>"It is said to have been left behind by a Divine Transformation Formation Master who fell due to a strange event. After research by the Immortal League, it is initially believed that the fusion of the marvels of heaven and earth with the bizarre rules from beyond the world caused a change in the Formation Crown itself." Mo Ru Bin explained in detail.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Li Fan understood the meaning behind Mo Ru Bin's words. The marvels of heaven and earth were the manifestation of the rules of the Huangxuan Realm, while the bizarre were the distorted remnants of the rules of the devoured worlds.</p><p></p><p>After the fusion of the two, incredible changes could occur.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had previously considered such a possibility when he glimpsed the true source of the bizarre. Unfortunately, he had not encountered any instances of it until now, but unexpectedly, Mo Ru Bin had casually presented it to him.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, with the resources the Transmissioner could access, it was something he could not compensate for within a short period despite multiple reincarnations and foresight.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew about this item, which Sun Xingwang obviously did not.</p><p></p><p>Pretending to feel a headache, he interrupted Mo Ru Bin, "Alright, enough of your incantations. Just tell me how to use this thing."</p><p></p><p>"The Impersonal Formation Crown is constantly evolving. Forming formations upon formations, endlessly. Just engrave the Xuantian Locking Spirit formation into it periodically, allowing it to naturally evolve. It's like a struggle among beasts; the one that survives in the end will definitely be the strongest." Mo Ru Bin also explained to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"That sounds simple, but it seems a bit unreliable in theory..." Li Fan mumbled, inspecting the green Impersonal Formation Crown.</p><p></p><p>"No problem. Although it's somewhat uncontrollable, it can definitely achieve our goals. Engraving the Xuantian Locking Spirit requires time and effort. Right now, I'm at the main headquarters of the Immortal League, under everyone's watchful eyes, making it inconvenient to do so. I can only entrust it to you." Moru Bin said solemnly.</p>

            <p>"But what errors can be found in this 'The Foundation Building Method Refining with Myself' that I have deduced?" </p><p></p><p>Watching Li Fan's puzzled expression, Yin Shangren opened his mouth as if to say something but hesitated. </p><p></p><p>In the end, he gave up in frustration.</p><p></p><p>After being in a daze for a long time, he finally got up again.</p><p></p><p>He walked past Li Fan and went to a blank wall in the underground secret room, using his hand as a pen.</p><p></p><p>He meticulously recorded the 'The Foundation Building Method Refining with Myself' in one go.</p><p></p><p>After finishing writing, he stood in front of it, his expression intoxicated.</p><p></p><p>His face showed a series of changes, with amazement, emotion, and regret.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't disturb him and stood quietly in front of this extraordinary foundation building method, silently admiring it.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown how much time had passed before Yin Shangren slowly came back to his senses.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Li Fan and bowed, saying, "If this method is truly comprehended by Daoist friend...‚Äù</p><p></p><p>"Then Daoist friend is truly a genius far beyond me! I am far inferior!"</p><p></p><p>"This version of 'The Foundation Building with Myself' is flawless. It can be considered a method handed down through generations!"</p><p></p><p>Then he sighed again, "If I had been fortunate enough to obtain this method when I was building my foundation back then, I wouldn't have ended up in the state I am in now."</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean by this, Daoist Yin?" Li Fan pretended not to know.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren smiled, and his body split open, revealing another self inside. </p><p></p><p>He then explained further, "After refining the foundation with myself, there is no chance for regret or redoing it."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan took the opportunity to comfort him, "In fact, there is not much difference between these two. Both reach a dead end in building the foundation."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren was a bit stunned, "What do you mean by this, Daoist?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan honestly said, "This is also one of the reasons why I came to find you, Daoist Yin."</p><p></p><p>"After deducing the way to refine the foundation with myself, I was extremely excited. I thought I had opened up a completely new path. I was confident and eager to continue deducing the following stages like Golden Core and Nascent Soul."</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly, a bitter expression on his face, "I pondered for a long time but couldn't find where the path ahead lies."</p><p></p><p>"After refining the foundation with myself, all laws converge into oneself. I think the same goes for the Golden Core. According to ancient cultivation classics, I call it the 'Primordial Golden Core.'"</p><p></p><p>"But how to achieve this perfect 'Primordial Golden Core,' I am at a loss. It's as if all inspiration has been exhausted, as if something is hindering me from exploring all this..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression became very pained as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren seemed to empathize and quickly comforted him, "To see through the mystery of 'The Foundation Building with Myself' is already a rare talent under the heavens, far beyond ordinary cultivators. Why be so hard on yourself?"</p><p></p><p>"As for the Primordial Golden Core you mentioned..."</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren pondered, "This is a path destined to be difficult. It can be described as going against the heavens."</p><p></p><p>With that, Yin Shangren seemed to remember something and fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>"I have a feeling in my heart. Perhaps in this lifetime, it may not be possible to further progress on this new path. That's why I came to find you, Daoist." Li Fan looked sincerely at Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>"To be the first to propose 'The Foundation Building with Myself,' Daoist's creative thinking is undoubtedly superior to mine. Perhaps you can pioneer another step?"</p><p></p><p>Without further ado, he directly presented his discourse on the 'Primordial Golden Core' to Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he stared expectantly at Yin Shangren, "What does Daoist think?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren couldn't help but be fascinated.</p><p></p><p>"Let me think, let me think," he seemed to be immersed in contemplation, his expression somewhat absent-minded.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he finally came to his senses.</p><p></p><p>"This method is difficult, even surpassing 'The Foundation Building with Myself.' It cannot be easily resolved in a short time."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, I have other things to study..." Yin Shangren's face showed some hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"I observed the situation on your island, seeming to be related to the celestial and worldly miasma?" Li Fan inquired.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren nodded, "Daoist indeed has sharp eyes. I have a premonition that within this celestial and worldly miasma, there hides a great secret of the world."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll preemptively congratulate Daoist on unlocking this mystery! When that day comes, I hope to share a thing or two with me." Li Fan laughed heartily, speaking naturally.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, if you can share the perfect 'The Foundation Building with Myself' with me without concealing anything, I will naturally do the same." Yin Shangren looked at Li Fan with great joy, "I never expected to meet someone like Daoist in this world, someone who shares the same ideals."</p><p></p><p>"I never thought I would meet someone like you before I came here." Li Fan also looked pleased.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I believe that Daoist doesn't need to worry about deducing the 'Primordial Golden Core' hindering the study of the celestial and worldly miasma. From my experience, the two can alternate and progress simultaneously. When one encounters a dead end, it's worth turning to the other. Perhaps soon, inspiration will arise on its own." Li Fan shared his "experience and insights" incessantly.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren's eyes sparkled as he listened.</p><p></p><p>The two hit it off immediately and talked for three days and nights on the island.</p><p></p><p>"This island is too harsh. How can it live up to Daoist's elegance? I have a small world that is beautiful and naturally pure, perfect for us to focus on our studies. Why not come back with me?" </p><p></p><p>One could have their own blessed land or small world in the Xuanhuang Realm, and they were all considered wealthy and prestigious individuals.</p><p></p><p>Yin Shangren, after hearing this, had a hint of surprise in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He hesitated, but in the end, he declined Li Fan's generous invitation.</p><p></p><p>"Although this island is small, I am used to it here. Perhaps in the future, when I tire of it, I will come to your place for a change of scenery."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not find Yin Shangren's response surprising. A look of great regret appeared on his face before bidding farewell with reluctance.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, he handed over his communication talisman, insisting on staying in touch and exchanging insights.</p><p></p><p>As he left the island, flying a distance away, he suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Looking back at the island, Li Fan hesitated for a moment before ultimately canceling his intention to use the 'Invisible Killing Intent' to lock onto Yin Shangren.</p><p></p><p>"Yin Shangren's strength is somewhat unordinary; he cannot be underestimated with ordinary foundation building methods. In this world, I have won his initial trust with 'The Foundation Building with Myself.' There is no need to add fuel to the fire."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Invisible Killing Intent,' though secretive, cannot guarantee that he won't detect it."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Fan finally left.</p><p></p><p>Flying westward all the way, he arrived in Shilin Prefecture after passing through the clouds and sea.</p><p></p><p>Since the fall of Jiushan Prefecture, the Wanxian Alliance had attempted several counterattacks, trying to retake it.</p><p></p><p>However, the Jiushan area was full of perilous terrain, each mountain and river acting as natural barriers.</p>

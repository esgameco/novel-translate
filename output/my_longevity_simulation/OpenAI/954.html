        <div class="content">
            <p>Every move, every action, even emotions and thoughts, are all within Li Fan's control.</p><p></p><p>Can one really evade by "not using"?</p><p></p><p>"It's normal to have some thoughts, as long as I can manipulate them. The way of the mystical beasts still seems to have unlimited potential."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not care about the double-dealing of the Empire and others, as they could not escape her control no matter what.</p><p></p><p>To test the effect of the "Heaven and Earth Forge," Li Fan returned to the Spirit Wood Realm and directly traveled through a spatial channel to the Beast Realm.</p><p></p><p>She placed one finished product on the mountaintop and set up formations for protection around it.</p><p></p><p>Then she left a strand of divine consciousness to observe the changes caused by the Heaven and Earth Forge.</p><p></p><p>The formations were just to prevent the beasts from damaging the forge and did not affect the spread of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the high concentration of spiritual energy around this peculiar device on the mountaintop attracted the attention of the beasts on the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Although most of them were low-level beasts that had not yet developed spiritual intelligence, due to their innate sensitivity to spiritual energy, they flocked to gather in front of the forge, greedily trying to absorb pure spiritual energy as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Without cultivation methods, they could not actively absorb the spiritual energy into their bodies. Most of the spiritual energy still overflowed into the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>After ten days, this originally inconspicuous small mountain unexpectedly became vibrant.</p><p></p><p>"At this rate, to transform a world without spiritual energy into a world that meets the minimum requirements for cultivation, it would take about a hundred Heaven and Earth Forges and a continuous hundred years. new Chapter 69 books â†’ www.69shux.com"</p><p></p><p>"If there are ten thousand forges, it can be done in a year!"</p><p></p><p>Having obtained rough data, Li Fan immediately summoned the treefolk clan.</p><p></p><p>With the continuous upgrade of the Spirit Wood Realm and the improvement of Lin Ling's cultivation, the strength of the female chief of the treefolk clan had also been growing day by day.</p><p></p><p>She had now reached the late stage of Nascent Soul Realm, only a step away from Integration Path.</p><p></p><p>Among the treefolk clan, there were also numerous Nascent Soul Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>The overall strength of the clan had undergone a qualitative leap compared to when Li Fan first took over the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the treefolk held Li Fan in great admiration.</p><p></p><p>When the female chief came before Li Fan, she knelt down, kowtowed, and saluted, "Greetings, esteemed one!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan placed a Heaven and Earth Forge in front of the female chief and explained in detail the method of forging it.</p><p></p><p>"Starting from today, use all the power of your clan to refine this item."</p><p></p><p>"Within three years, I want to connect those small worlds in the Spirit Wood Realm to make them all suitable for cultivation."</p><p></p><p>The female chief immediately took her orders and left.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, watching the busy treefolk, Li Fan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>The tireless treefolk were truly most suitable for this kind of work.</p><p></p><p>With the continuous improvement of the "Formation Refinement," the entire Spirit Wood Realm was now completely under Li Fan's control.</p><p></p><p>With a single thought, he could decide their life or death without any risk of losing control.</p><p></p><p>After a few more days, after the bored Tianyang saw the actions of the treefolk, he took the initiative and took charge of the matter.</p><p></p><p>He felt that refining the Heaven and Earth Forge and then arranging them one by one in various corners of the small worlds was akin to planting trees and afforestation.</p><p></p><p>Quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>With Tianyang's help, Li Fan no longer had to worry.</p><p></p><p>He passed on the technique he had derived from the End Disintegration Disc, designed specifically for protecting and connecting all the Heaven and Earth Forges, to Tianyang, and Li Fan took on the role of a hands-off manager.</p><p></p><p>Tianyang's formation attainment was already outstanding from being able to refine his own puppet body with the Earth Fire Return to Origin Formation in the past.</p><p></p><p>During this period, his consciousness became increasingly clear, and under Li Fan's personal guidance, he quickly mastered this formation.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan let Tianyang name the formation; Tianyang showed a silly smile.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a full seven days and nights, he finally came up with a good name: "Heaven and Earth Myriad Spirit Great Formation."</p><p></p><p>The Heaven and Earth Myriad Spirit Formation could use all the arranged Heaven and Earth Forges as nodes to form a spiritual energy network that crossed the small worlds.</p><p></p><p>Once the grand formation took shape, even if a node was damaged, the spiritual energy network could make up for the missing spiritual energy through connections without reducing the overall concentration of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>In addition to disseminating spiritual energy, this spiritual energy network also had many functions such as surveillance, attack, defense, and more.</p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's imagination, the ultimate form of the Heaven and Earth Myriad Spirit Formation should be higher level than the "Mysterious Web," able to create and evolve a world of cultivation on its own.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, it's just a bit smaller in scale now, but fundamentally, it's already very close."</p><p></p><p>"However, it still requires a derivative calculation and coordination core, like the Tianxuan Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"Only the Tianxuan Mirror can support the envisioned scale of the Heaven and Earth Myriad Spirit Formation. Even my End Disintegration Disc wouldn't be sufficient."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's thoughts fluctuated, unable to calm down for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an inexplicable restlessness disrupted her thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's expression changed slightly, and her figure flickered as she directly left the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after arriving in the Xuanhuang Realm, the voice of the Heavenly Doctor sounded in her mind.</p><p></p><p>"I have perceived that the seal of the Emperor of Clouds and Water's Heavenly Palace has loosened. Go reinforce the seal to prevent outsiders from disturbing it."</p><p></p><p>Upon finishing his words, a prohibition named "Concealment and Concealment" appeared in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Doctor seemed quite busy.</p><p></p><p>Before Li Fan could respond, the voice disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remained expressionless but felt a sinking feeling in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"Anchor for eleven years, the Heavenly Palace of Clouds and Water is open."</p><p></p><p>"I almost forgot about this."</p><p></p><p>"But what does the Heavenly Doctor mean by this task? Is it a test or something else?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not too surprised that the Heavenly Doctor could directly lock onto and contact her.</p><p></p><p>After all, they had met face to face in this world and she had accepted the "Heaven-Repairing Record" he had transmitted.</p><p></p><p>This was the price to pay for direct contact with the Heavenly Doctor.</p><p></p><p>However, despite this lack of security, Li Fan felt somewhat uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Without much consideration, Li Fan bowed slightly to the sky and then headed towards the Sea of Clouds.</p><p></p><p>Arriving in the center of the Sea of Clouds, where the Emperor of Clouds and Water's Heavenly Palace was located.</p><p></p><p>Although the Heavenly Palace of Clouds and Water had not yet fully appeared in the world, there were already some strange signs in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Attracting passing cultivators to stop and observe from time to time.</p><p></p><p>Using the prohibition transmitted by the Heavenly Doctor, Li Fan silently entered the palace.</p><p></p><p>She was on guard against entering Senior Brother Qin's illusion but ended up directly in front of the main gate of the Emperor of Clouds and Water's Heavenly Palace.</p><p></p><p>She didn't enter Senior Brother Qin's illusion test.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, the statue transformed by Senior Brother Qin stood silently, seemingly timeless.</p><p></p><p>The entire Heavenly Palace of Clouds and Water was quiet.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like all the mysteries within it were dormant.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Li Fan saw the Emperor of Clouds and Water's Heavenly Palace in a sealed state, compared to what she had seen before.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Heavenly Palace of Clouds and Water gave Li Fan the feeling of an ordinary sect where cultivators were resting.</p>

            <p>Moreover, what's even more wonderful is that this disseminator is not a true disseminator.</p><p></p><p>His true identity is the Malevolent Hearted Sovereign of the Dark Heaven Teaching.</p><p></p><p>"When you reach the level of a disseminator, casually revealing any information holds unimaginable value and endless benefits."</p><p></p><p>"The only difficulty now is how to contact this Mo Rubin and gain his trust."</p><p></p><p>Similar to when he plummeted into the Immortal Realm before, Li Fan only glimpsed a few memories of Mo Rubin. However, any memory related to techniques, divine abilities, and secret arts did not survive.</p><p></p><p>So in order to disguise well in front of this Malevolent Hearted Sovereign of the Dark Heaven Teaching, without revealing anything, lengthy planning is still required.</p><p></p><p>Mo Rubin has infiltrated the Ten Immortal Alliance, seemingly without any impact on the current situation in the Xuan Huang Realm.</p><p></p><p>During this time, conflicts between the Ten Immortal Alliance and the Five Elders Association continue.</p><p></p><p>The main issue is still the disseminator‚Äôs Law Image, frequently appearing in the territory of the Five Elders Association.</p><p></p><p>The range of techniques being used increased, and the Law Image became more lifelike.</p><p></p><p>Based on the latest images transmitted from the Five Elders Association, on the originally solemn and dignified face of the Law Image, subtle emotional fluctuations can now be observed.</p><p></p><p>It's truly astonishing.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it's due to this increasingly lifelike Law Image that the Five Eternal Elders felt slightly uneasy.

New 69bookclub‚Ñ™69shuxi.com</p><p></p><p>However, one rumor caught Li Fan's attention.</p><p></p><p>It was said that this Law Image might be related to the statues of the Law Elders scattered throughout the alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Have you ever wondered why statues of the Law Elders stand tall in every celestial city?"</p><p></p><p>"Also, have you ever used the Transcendental Teleportation Array? It‚Äôs said that the inside of those statues is hollowed out to be used as a carrier for the teleportation array!"</p><p></p><p>"How sacrilegious!"</p><p></p><p>"Although the Law Elders do not interfere with worldly affairs, their authority remains. How could the Ten Immortal Alliance dare to do such a thing without their permission?!"</p><p></p><p>"I dare say there must be something fishy going on!"</p><p></p><p>A cultivator named Yue Gu solemnly proclaimed.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Yue makes a valid point! It's no wonder every time I use the Transcendental Teleportation Array and see the cloud that symbolizes the Xuan Huang Realm, I feel a strange sensation in my heart."</p><p></p><p>"I think you are all overthinking it. It's clear that the Law Image is manifested through the thirty-three immortal candidates and has nothing to do with those statues!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone held their own opinions, unable to convince one another.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan, on the other hand, remembered the statues of the Law Elders in many cities, pondering deeply.</p><p></p><p>"In the heart of the Law Image, the Xuan Huang Realm holds a unique and critical position."</p><p></p><p>"Even if he temporarily withdraws, he shouldn't have left „ÄêThe Deepest Starry Sky„Äë. And if I were to disseminate, as a precautionary measure, I would undoubtedly leave a contingency plan in the Xuan Huang Realm. Just in case."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps these statues are the means of dissemination."</p><p></p><p>"And the thirty-three immortal candidates are the keys to activating this method."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan speculated subtly in his mind.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan wasn't in a hurry to verify.</p><p></p><p>Since he had already left a disintegration disc inside one of the Immortal Candidates, Wei Qi, as long as Wei Qi falls, the recorded secrets would be fed back to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>So before the end of this world, he would definitely wait for the day when Wei Qi fell, unless there were unexpected circumstances.</p><p></p><p>For now, putting aside the conflicts in the Xuan Huang Realm, Li Fan began to refine a new clone in the secret chamber of the Spiritual Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>The previous clone, Ji Shao Li, had already died at the hands of the young disseminator, posing potential dangers in the Xuan Huang Realm without a clone.</p><p></p><p>This time, Li Fan secretly obtained a strand of blood from Su Yuqing and used it to refine the clone.</p><p></p><p>Unlike in the past, Li Fan, who had mastered the Law of Endless Reality, specially treated the clone's soul.</p><p></p><p>He removed all memories related to „ÄêThe Real One„Äë from the soul and made modifications to the rest.</p><p></p><p>The clone would still transmit sensations back to the original body, but the original body would only selectively accept the experiences of the clone.</p><p></p><p>In the clone's memory, he is a clone created by an ancient King of the Dark Heaven Teaching after awakening from a deep slumber.</p><p></p><p>Due to severe injuries, his memories were also incomplete.</p><p></p><p>However, he remembered the grace of the Dark Heaven King back then and vowed to rebuild the Dark Heaven Teaching.</p><p></p><p>Thus, he secretly gathered forces from various small worlds, organized the Worldly Union Association, and recruited soldiers and horses for the revival of the teaching.</p><p></p><p>Such manipulation of the soul was not something Li Fan could originally achieve.</p><p></p><p>However, after mastering the Law of Endless Reality, it became possible.</p><p></p><p>Although the method was somewhat rough and could cause direct soul trauma due to imprecise cutting, Li Fan, armed with the amazing soul-repairing ability of the Law of Endless Reality, managed to achieve selective soul modification through constant experimentation.</p><p></p><p>He fooled the young disseminator by forging false memories for the clone Ji Shao Li using this method.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the exceptionally handsome clone in front of him, Li Fan showed a satisfied smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"True caution lies in guarding against even one's own clone."</p><p></p><p>"At times, it's even necessary to throw it out as bait."</p><p></p><p>This was Li Fan's progress after experiencing the events with the young disseminator and the Malevolent Hearted Sovereign of the Dark Heaven Teaching.</p><p></p><p>Pointing towards the clone's brow, the clone's eyebrows trembled slightly, gradually awakening.</p>

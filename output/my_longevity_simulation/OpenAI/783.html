        <h1>Chapter 783</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"So many years have passed. Even if it's just a monkey, it should have become enlightened. Not to mention our 'Hua Dao Shi Mu,'" he said.</p><p></p><p>They scoffed at Fang Zaiji's doubts.</p><p></p><p>However, Fang Zaiji exchanged a glance with Xu Bai, and transmitted a message: "Master, something seems strange. I remember that back then, the Taiyan Sect was extremely cautious about the birth of self-awareness in the 'Hua Dao Shi Mu.'"</p><p></p><p>"After all, the lifespan of cultivators is limited, while the lifespan of the 'Hua Dao Shi Mu' is unlimited. If it truly develops spiritual wisdom..."</p><p></p><p>"Who exactly holds authority in the Taiyan Sect is hard to say. We should still be cautious," Fang Zaiji reminded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai nodded slightly, but remained composed.</p><p></p><p>Curiously, he asked, "To be honest, since we've come from afar, we actually have some understanding of your Taiyan Sect."</p><p></p><p>"The Taiyan Divine Calculation can predict the future through endless calculations, but it also needs initial data support. You've been secluded in the Tai Xuan Realm for thousands of years, cut off from the world. In the Xuan Huang Realm, there have been earth-shattering changes. How can you ensure the accuracy of your predictions?" Xu Bai inquired.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Xu Bai's words, the middle-aged disciple of the Taiyan Sect was quite surprised. Then his face showed even more joy, "So you have some understanding of divination? It seems you're truly a destined person for our Taiyan Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"As for your concerns..."</p><p></p><p>He said somewhat complacently, "Who said our Taiyan Sect has been cut off from the world for thousands of years? In fact, the sect sends specialized personnel out regularly to gather various information about the Xuan Huang Realm. This is done in order to adjust the results of the divination of the 'Shi Mu.'"</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, it hasn't been long since the Wanxian Alliance launched its expedition to the myriad realms. If it weren't for early anticipation, how could they have reacted so quickly?" </p><p></p><p>"Adjust the results, I see," Xu Bai nodded thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I've told you so much. Are you willing to join our Taiyan Sect or not?" </p><p></p><p>At this point, they were about to fly to the outside of the floating city in the sky, and one of the disciples of the Taiyan Sect, a short and hunched-over cultivator, grew a bit impatient.</p><p></p><p>"I'm actually a little interested," Xu Bai rubbed his chin.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Fang Zaiji rolled his eyes at him.</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the Taiyan Sect couldn't help but show excitement at Xu Bai's words.</p><p></p><p>"But I have some concerns. In fact, before coming here, I had already joined another sect. And because of some special reasons, I can't leave it. I wonder if you mind?" Xu Bai said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?!" The disciples of the Taiyan Sect were all stunned for a moment, and even their flying bodies came to a sudden stop. They turned back to look at Xu Bai.</p><p></p><p>"Are you here to make trouble?!" The short cultivator was even angrier.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to get angry, he was stopped by the middle-aged disciple.</p><p></p><p>"When Senior Brother assigned the task, he didn't say this was not allowed." After thinking for a moment, he looked carefully at Xu Bai and then bit the bullet and said, "I can't decide on this matter either. So, come back to the sect with me first! Whether it will work or not, let Senior Brother decide."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai didn't expect the Taiyan Sect to be so eager to recruit disciples. He didn't show any fear and simply nodded.</p><p></p><p>Arriving outside the floating city in the sky, Xu Bai found that the entire city was enveloped in a layer of transparent crystal for protection.</p><p></p><p>When the face of the middle-aged cultivator was reflected on it, a very familiar blue light appeared on the transparent crystal. Then, the middle-aged cultivator also turned into a blue light and flew into the city in an instant. The other disciples followed suit.</p><p></p><p>"You can come in directly." Not far away, the middle-aged cultivator said through the crystal barrier.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Fang Zaiji rushed in before Xu Bai and entered the city.</p><p></p><p>When he was about to touch the transparent crystal barrier, it was as if it didn't exist at all and he effortlessly passed through.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji looked around but found nothing unusual. He then signaled Xu Bai to come in.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Bai passed through the crystal barrier, it felt like passing through a space made up of countless mirrors. He saw numerous different versions of himself, as if experiencing various events.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he returned to reality.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, I'll take you to see Senior Brother," the middle-aged cultivator said to Xu Bai with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Walking in the floating city, Xu Bai could see many Taiyan Sect cultivators around.</p><p></p><p>Their cultivations spanned from Foundation Establishment to Nascent Soul. There were even a few white-bearded cultivators that made Fang Zaiji look solemn, indicating they were Dao Fusion realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>They all seemed very relaxed, some chatting quietly with each other, some calculating things on their fingers.</p><p></p><p>Some were playing with an object similar to a Rubik's cube, constantly changing images on it. From the ever-changing scenes, it seemed somewhat similar to the 'Heaven Locking Treasure Box' that Li Fan had found in the Yi Xing Tomb.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Bai and his group walked past, they only glanced casually and then retracted their gaze, showing no excessive interest in Xu Bai's extraordinary appearance.</p><p></p><p>What's even stranger was how they greeted the few leading individuals ahead.</p><p></p><p>Their titles to each other were all like "Senior Brother" or "Junior Brother."</p><p></p><p>Even the white-haired Dao Fusion elders were addressed in the same way.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai couldn't help but furrow his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit strange. The strength of this Taiyan Sect seems to be too intact. We've seen at least a dozen Dao Fusion cultivators along the way, right? The foundation of the Taiyan Sect is unexpectedly profound?"</p><p></p><p>"And, Dao Fusion experts actually referring to Foundation Establishment cultivators as Senior Brothers or Junior Brothers..."</p><p></p><p>A hint of interest appeared on Xu Bai's face.</p><p></p><p>"That's not it!" Fang Zaiji's voice sounded urgent.</p><p></p><p>"When I first came in, I didn't realize it. But after carefully observing for a while, I discoveredâ€¦"</p><p></p><p>"This place is a ghostly place!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's steps slightly faltered, "Ghostly place? What do you mean by that, Elder Fang?"</p><p></p><p>"Look carefully again, at these people. They're actually not real!" Fang Zaiji's voice trembled.</p><p></p><p>"Even this city we're standing in is probably fake!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Fang Zaiji's reminder, Xu Bai's gaze involuntarily hardened.</p><p></p><p>As he continued to walk slowly, he carefully observed once again.</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai's talent was among the finest in the world.</p><p></p><p>When he looked closely, he indeed noticed some abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators in this floating city, from Nascent Soul to Foundation Establishment, emitted a faint aura that was all exactly the same!</p><p></p><p>It was as if they were all the same person!</p><p></p><p>It's just that their faces differed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the middle-aged cultivator leading the way seemed to sense Xu Bai's reaction.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly turned around, revealing a slightly sinister smile, "What's wrong, Daoist friend? Do you have any doubts?"</p>

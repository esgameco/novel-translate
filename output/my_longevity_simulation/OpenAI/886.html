        <h1>Chapter 886</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan looked at the faceless statue in front of him, his expression changing constantly. Regardless of the method used to test it, the results were the same: this stone statue seemed plain and ordinary, without any hint of extraordinary power.</p><p></p><p>But even this seemingly ordinary existence could shield spiritual perception and could only be seen with "eyes."</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the Faceless Mysterious Sky God Statue was definitely not as simple as it appeared.</p><p></p><p>And...</p><p></p><p>In this world, Li Fan called it "Merciful True Immortal of the Mortal World," and used it as a relay station for feedback in the meditation techniques. All the members of the mutual aid society who swore in front of the statue all felt an inexplicable sense of "restraint."</p><p></p><p>Through the side attacks of the alternate identity Ji Shao Li, it was basically confirmed that this was not a singular accidental phenomenon but a universal one.</p><p></p><p>One must know that the oath designed by Li Fan for membership was simply a piece of text, without any additional mystical power.</p><p></p><p>"And it's not a psychological effect either."</p><p></p><p>"In the face of the cultivators' oaths, the Mysterious Sky God Statue really produces a special response."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted his eyes, his gaze falling on the empty face of the statue.</p><p></p><p>Placing the statue in the main hall at the entrance of the All Realms Union for countless visitors to admire in the future.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was nearly certain that unexpected changes would definitely occur!</p><p></p><p>"Is the statue developing self-awareness? Or will it attract remnants of the Mysterious Sky Religion?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Li Fan decisively put down the Mysterious Sky God Statue.</p><p></p><p>With a bang, the faceless stone statue safely landed on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Then countless white threads appeared around, which were part of the core of the Spiritual Wood Realm's array, the Disintegration Disc No. 2, protecting the statue rapidly with the array.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, I can easily suppress ordinary Dao masters. And with this array spread throughout the small world..."</p><p></p><p>"Not entering the small world of eternal life, I am invincible in this Spiritual Wood Realm."</p><p></p><p>A glint of determination flashed in Li Fan's eyes. "If they don't come, it's fine."</p><p></p><p>"If they really dare to come here, let them try my methods!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had no doubt that there were still members of the former Mysterious Sky Religion in the Mysterious Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, from what he knew, there was a Mysterious Sky Religion law king slumbering in the remains of the Purple Cloud Sect in Linlang Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Certainly, there would be remnants in other places as well.</p><p></p><p>However, at this point, Li Fan didn't have much fear.</p><p></p><p>"According to various information I've obtained, except for the Mysterious Sky King at the half-immortal realm, the other twelve law kings of the Mysterious Sky Religion are only fighting forces of the old Dao Longevity."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sneered inwardly. In the next moment, his figure gradually faded and appeared in the space directly under the Spiritual Tree.</p><p></p><p>This was the core of the entire Spiritual Wood Realm, more important than the Spiritual Wood itself.</p><p></p><p>A separate space, able to be cut off from the Spiritual Wood Realm at any time for survival.</p><p></p><p>Outside the space, layers of the Spiritual Wood Array enveloped. The body of the Disintegration Disc No. 2 was placed here.</p><p></p><p>This was also where Li Fan planned to seclude himself and practice.</p><p></p><p>"Given enough preparation, even against the old Dao Longevity, I may have a chance at fighting."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Li Fan took out a rainbow light cocooned sphere from his own pocket dimension.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the cocooned sphere appeared, the Spiritual Wood above seemed to sense some deadly threat.</p><p></p><p>The branches stirred without wind, and the upright body trembled incessantly.</p><p></p><p>This attracted the spirits within the Spiritual Wood Realm to look.</p><p></p><p>Unintentionally witnessing the destructive power of the mysterious gray mold inside the three-eyed skull, Li Fan couldn't help but feel secretly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"In theory, this three-eyed skull also belongs to me. So when I restart this time, can I choose to keep it?"</p><p></p><p>"If I can, I should be able to figure out its details."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Li Fan took out an ice-sealed exotic beast he had plundered from the Imperial Treasury.</p><p></p><p>As if sensing the breath of life, the gray mold residing inside the three-eyed skull suddenly became restless.</p><p></p><p>When Li Fan removed the rainbow light surrounding the exotic beast, he clearly observed the squirming of the gray mold as if it were alive.</p><p></p><p>However, for it, the presence of the skull seemed like a shackle.</p><p></p><p>As the mold was about to spread beyond the skull, it suddenly retracted.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan carefully observed the changes in the dark golden patterns on the skull's surface during this process.</p><p></p><p>But to his disappointment, the enigmatic patterns remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>"Could my guess be wrong? Is this three-eyed skull really dead?"</p><p></p><p>Being extremely cautious, Li Fan manipulated the ice-sealed exotic beast to approach the skull.</p><p></p><p>The gray mold became more irritable.</p><p></p><p>It floated within the skull, seemingly ready to pounce viciously at any moment.</p><p></p><p>But as if reluctant, it always stopped at the most critical moment.</p><p></p><p>Watching this scene, Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Under his control, the ice-sealed beast gradually regained vitality.</p><p></p><p>The breath of life suddenly became strong.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, unable to resist the temptation, a large section of the gray mold suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>There were no traces of movement.</p><p></p><p>Instead, as if the space had been directly corrupted, a hole similar to a yellow spot appeared.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the once vibrant exotic beast completely faded like a desaturated photo, then slowly descended and dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Within those gray fragments, Li Fan keenly saw a new small piece of gray mold!</p><p></p><p>Having waited for so long, he naturally did not miss such a good opportunity.</p><p></p><p>A rainbow light burst out like a galloping horse, instantly sealing and enveloping the newly appeared gray mold layer by layer.</p><p></p><p>The gray mold, which had just regained its freedom, saw itself about to be sealed again.</p><p></p><p>Enraged to the extreme, it struck towards the rainbow light as if wanting to erode it.</p><p></p><p>But how could the keen-eyed Li Fan be deceived by its tricks?</p><p></p><p>While not neglecting the main body, he released endless radiance to seal off even the tiny gray spot in the nearby space corner.</p><p></p><p>"Playing these little tricks in front of me is truly laughable."</p>

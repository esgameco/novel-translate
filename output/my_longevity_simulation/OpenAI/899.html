        <h1>Chapter 899</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Since the profound background of the Xuantian Sect is beyond imagination.</p><p></p><p>Then let's change the plan first, and not provoke them for now.</p><p></p><p>Thinking like this, Li Fan planned to use the Seven-Colored Divine Light to reseal this faceless deity statue.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Fan was about to do so, his movements suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>Because at that moment, this statue seemed to come alive.</p><p></p><p>Even though this stone statue had no eyes, Li Fan clearly felt that she "looked" at him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but retreat a distance backward abruptly, preparing himself mentally at the same time.</p><p></p><p>After several breaths, everything seemed calm. No unusual incidents occurred, and Li Fan slowly approached again.</p><p></p><p>The faceless stone statue was the same as when he placed it before.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like that glimpse just now was his illusion.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan even flipped through the images recorded in his mind of the Hua Dao Stone.</p><p></p><p>The stone statues inside stood quietly, like ordinary objects.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing special about them.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I was mistaken?" Li Fan was somewhat skeptical.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, he finally decided to eliminate this trouble.</p><p></p><p>As he unleashed the colorful divine light, he was about to seal and put away the faceless deity statue.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan's expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>Because, although the stone statue was right in front of him, it seemed as if it didn't actually exist!</p><p></p><p>The Seven-Colored Divine Light sealed nothing, and he returned empty-handed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>He tried to touch the stone statue with his hand.</p><p></p><p>The chilly touch felt extremely real.</p><p></p><p>But when Li Fan tried to lock it with his divine sense and store it in his storage space, the divine sense sensed that the stone statue was empty.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't actually do it.</p><p></p><p>This strange scene had already exceeded Li Fan's understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the lingering soul of the Xuantian King?" Li Fan's face alternated between gloom and brightness.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan could be sure that before this, the stone statue had not undergone such a change.</p><p></p><p>But with that glimpse just now, it seemed like some mysterious change had taken place on the stone statue.</p><p></p><p>Turning the stone statue into its current special state of being and non-being.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it was not my illusion. Even the Hua Dao Stone couldn't record it..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face darkened instantly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he finally understood what it meant to invite the spirits easily but have a hard time sending them away.</p><p></p><p>This stone statue actually stayed here and didn't leave.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it had settled down in this Spiritwood Realm in the Union Headquarters of the Myriad Realms, just like making it its home.</p><p></p><p>The base he had painstakingly built had been installed with an unremovable bomb. And this bomb was placed by Li Fan on a whim...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's face twitched.</p><p></p><p>As he contemplated whether to abandon this Spiritwood Realm and start afresh.</p><p></p><p>"May the merciful immortal in the mortal world bless my exploration of the Fire Realm this time, and may everything go smoothly..."</p><p></p><p>A melodious female voice suddenly appeared in the grand hall.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan couldn't help but jump in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, he didn't find the source of the voice.</p><p></p><p>But the prayer did not disappear, but continued incessantly.</p><p></p><p>From the beginning with the voice of Su Yuqing from the Lei Bound, to later ones like He Zhenghao, Kou Hong, Dao Xuanzi, and others.</p><p></p><p>One after another, they appeared in succession.</p><p></p><p>After careful observation, Li Fan discovered that these voices actually appeared directly in his mind!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as long as he focused his attention on a particular voice.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the corresponding scene would also appear.</p><p></p><p>Even...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan faintly sensed that if he wished, he could also respond to these supplicants.</p><p></p><p>"What is going on?"</p><p></p><p>He never knew that he had such abilities that were almost identical to the legends of the gods.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was completely shocked.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the faceless deity statue standing quietly in the grand hall, knowing in his heart that all of this must surely be its doing.</p><p></p><p>"I fabricated the story of the merciful immortal in the mortal world in the past, using the faceless stone statue as a mediator to establish a connection between me and the members of the Union of Myriad Realms."</p><p></p><p>"So that I could receive feedback on their cultivation progress after advancing..."</p><p></p><p>"But that was the effect of the 'Sit Immortal Art,' and it was limited to that."</p><p></p><p>"Now..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, his expression incredibly solemn.</p><p></p><p>Although it seemed that there was no immediate danger, he had already considered whether to follow through with it in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't understand the principle behind it, it was obvious that there must be a power far beyond Li Fan's understanding hidden behind this faceless deity statue.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan silently recited the summoning.</p><p></p><p>The summons instantly emerged.</p><p></p><p>"Whether to virtualize the current scene and return to the anchor point."</p><p></p><p>The surroundings also became virtualized.</p><p></p><p>"Using the summoning has not been affected..."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I wish, I can reopen it at any time."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan contemplated, but in the end, he chose not to.</p><p></p><p>It was not because he was influenced by some mysterious power and couldn't make a decision on summoning.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was because nothing dangerous had occurred yet, and the source of these anomalies had not been clarified...</p><p></p><p>He would feel ashamed to go through with the summoning in such a situation!</p><p></p><p>"Even if it were a true immortal in the Immortal Realm, I have met them face to face."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan coldly snorted in his heart, forcibly calming himself down.</p><p></p><p>He focused on the deity statue and the many voices that appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan found that the owners of these voices, without exception, were those who, in the name of the "merciful immortal in the mortal world," had once sworn in front of the faceless deity statue.</p><p></p><p>Unrelated to the merciful immortal in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>But they had seen the faceless deity statue at the beginning and associated it with the so-called merciful immortal in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>So, whether they liked it or not, the faceless deity statue would intermittently appear in their minds from then on.</p><p></p><p>And the more they contemplated, the deeper the connection between them and the statue became.</p><p></p><p>As a result, when they broke through a certain limit, they would appear in Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Xuantian Sect is called the Xuantian Sect."</p><p></p><p>"When the followers of the Xuantian Sect were widespread in the world, could the Xuantian King also be able to sense and know the conditions of his believers like me at any time?"</p><p></p><p>"Then it truly would be no different from a god."</p><p></p><p>"A god..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a thought and felt the most profound connection in his mind.</p><p></p><p>It was Su Yuqing from the Lei Bound.</p><p></p><p>Although she had outstanding talent and was the incarnation of the Heavenly Dao in the Lei Bound.</p><p></p><p>But constrained by the environment and limited resources, she had only reached the early stages of the Golden Core realm for now.</p><p></p><p>In the scarce resources of Da Li, all spiritual energy came from the "Immortal Spirit Tower."</p><p></p><p>Her ability to reach this realm in a short period was truly remarkable.</p><p></p><p>Through the connection with the faceless stone statue, Li Fan sensed the condition of Su Yuqing's body.</p><p></p><p>It was almost as if he were personally observing with his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>Every detail was clear, and nothing could be hidden.</p><p></p><p>"Even..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had a feeling.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a trace of essence spirit power that was insignificant to him but extremely significant to Su Yuqing disappeared from his body.</p>

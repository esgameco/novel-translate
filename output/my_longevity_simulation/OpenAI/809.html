        <div class="content">
            <p>Su Yuqing digested the contents in her mind and then looked at the compassionate immortal in front of her, couldn't help but ask, "Immortal, when will you leave? Will I be all aloneâ€¦?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan reached out and interrupted her, "No need to worry, believe in yourself. With your talent, you are capable of shouldering the great responsibility of saving the outer realms."</p><p></p><p>"Me?" Su Yuqing was a bit puzzled. But hearing the words of encouragement from the immortal, she couldn't help but feel a surge of confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I won't just leave and completely let go," Li Fan handed her a jade token.</p><p></p><p>"Worldly affairs are unpredictable, especially when it involves the struggle of the worlds. If you encounter any difficulties that you cannot handle, you can use this jade token to contact my disciples. If anyone is near the outer realms, they will come to help."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Su Yuqing couldn't help but widen her eyes, "Immortal, do you have many disciples?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan stroked his transforming white beard and smiled without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>Su Yuqing hesitated at first.</p><p></p><p>But finally gathered the courage to ask, "Immortal, am I... also your disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan neither confirmed nor denied it.</p><p></p><p>He just left her with a profound and unpredictable figure, "That will depend on your performance in the outer realms."</p><p></p><p>"Wandering through the myriad worlds, saving sentient beings with just a thought."</p><p></p><p>"No one knows my true name, I am the compassionate immortal of the mortal realm!"</p><p></p><p>On the small immortal mountain, Su Yuqing listened to the lingering verses in the air trance-like.</p><p></p><p>"The compassionate immortal..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems to be quite in line with the actions of the immortal leader," Su Yuqing thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, the compassionate immortal, who was full of compassion in Su Yuqing's heart, was about to fly out of the outer realms.</p><p></p><p>"The body of the exotic beast stored in the Immortal Tower is enough to support the cultivation of people in the outer realms for a period of time."</p><p></p><p>"However, to truly turn the outer realms into my pasture, the issue of the source of spiritual energy must be completely resolved."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered in his mind, "I'm afraid even if the entire beast species realm is completely eradicated, it still won't be enough."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps a visit to the Empire is needed."</p><p></p><p>"At present, my strength at the Golden Core Realm is too low. I urgently need to find a helper."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Fan thought of the figure of that imposing red-black puppet.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Tianyang, I have said that if you don't die, I will treat you well. Now, it's time to fulfill my promise!"</p><p></p><p>It was well known that Li Daoshi always did what he said.</p><p></p><p>Having made up his mind, after leaving the outer realms, he headed straight for the Tianyang Cave.</p><p></p><p>As for the outer realms, with the many cultivation experiences Li Fan had passed on to Su Yuqing, there shouldn't be any problems in the short term.</p><p></p><p>It would take 14 years for Tianyang to awaken from his slumber.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Tianyang Cave, it was still quiet as before.</p><p></p><p>No one would have expected that deep beneath the sea, there was an ancient puppet sleeping, constantly strengthening itself with the help of the underground fire.</p><p></p><p>"Earth Fire Returning Origin Array."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>The End Disintegration Disc in his sea of consciousness emitted a faint light. In an instant, he had found the loopholes in the formation here.</p><p></p><p>"It's really fast."</p><p></p><p>Even though Li Fan had estimated the capabilities of the fully developed Disintegration Disc, he was still somewhat shocked the first time he used it to break a formation.</p><p></p><p>After all, skilled formation masters tend to adjust formations according to the environment they are in.</p><p></p><p>So even with a good understanding of the formation structure, when it comes to actually breaking a formation, one still needs to be cautious and put in a lot of effort.</p><p></p><p>However, the Disintegration Disc had already considered all the possible impacts the environment could have on a formation.</p><p></p><p>Various variations already existed in its database.</p><p></p><p>Just by comparing and calling upon them, the method of breaking the formation could be found instantly.</p><p></p><p>And even if the formation was quite tricky, with the terrifying computational power of the End Disintegration Disc, breaking it was just a matter of an instant.</p><p></p><p>Unknown formations could actually enhance the Disintegration Disc further.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Witnessing the entire process of the End Disintegration Disc breaking the formation, Li Fan even felt a sense of sorrow as a formation master.</p><p></p><p>He felt that all the formations he had studied diligently for many lifetimes had become a joke in front of it.</p><p></p><p>"Once this thing is used, no formation master in the world can be arrogant anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, it's in my hands."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flickered as he went through the Earth Fire Returning Origin Array and arrived by Tianyang's side.</p><p></p><p>Being only the size of a child, Tianyang seemed to retain his original appearance.</p><p></p><p>The surging underground fire, guided by the Returning Origin Array, turned into strands of hot red energy that were absorbed by the puppet's body.</p><p></p><p>"Younger Junior Brother!"</p><p></p><p>As he approached, Li Fan had already activated the All-Encompassing Melting Furnace Technique and transformed into the appearance of Senior Brother Tianyang.</p><p></p><p>Just like in the previous life, he easily gained Tianyang's trust.</p><p></p><p>But this time, Tianyang seemed to have been born prematurely and appeared to be somewhat underdeveloped.</p><p></p><p>His spirits were low.</p><p></p><p>And his strength had only barely reached the late stage of Nascent Soul realm.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan didn't mind too much.</p><p></p><p>Rather than wasting time absorbing the power of the underground fire under the sea, it was better to follow behind Li Fan and prepare for an early advancement to the Harmony Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Treating well" was not just a saying.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Red Flame Cloud and Blue Wind of the Clouds and Mist World.</p><p></p><p>As well as the Black Marsh from Harmony Dao of Long Jiuyuan in the previous life.</p><p></p><p>Just by synchronizing with the memories of Mr. Self-Confession in various locations in the realms of Xuan Huang, Li Fan knew of at least five locations.</p><p></p><p>If given enough power, it wouldn't be difficult to instantly produce five or six Harmony Dao cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"But the birth of Harmony Dao cultivators will inevitably attract the attention of the strong in the Xuan Huang realm."</p><p></p><p>"Especially at this time when the teachings of Fa should still be in the Xuan Huang realm. So we need to be careful."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought so, sitting on Tianyang's shoulder, heading towards another entrance to a small world he remembered.</p><p></p><p>In order to establish a true Alliance of the Myriad Realms, a safe and discreet base was undoubtedly essential.</p><p></p><p>The place shouldn't be too small, and there should be sufficient spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>The local resistance force shouldn't be too strong either.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to the purification of the Cloud Sect in the previous life across various realms.</p><p></p><p>The entrance to this small world was located in Shilin Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>In the stone forest where remnants of the Celestial Mechanics Sect had been discovered.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan had been to this place in his previous life but hadn't noticed the existence of a spatial passage at all.</p><p></p><p>Which proved its concealment.</p><p></p><p>In fact, in the previous life, this small world only emerged after the Taiyan Sect surrendered.</p><p></p><p>They came out and pledged allegiance.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, even with the assistance of the Tianyuan Treasure Mirror by the Immortals Alliance cultivators, it wouldn't have been easy to find this small world.</p><p></p><p>With countless twists and turns in the underground stone cave.</p><p></p><p>Even with his previous life's memories, Li Fan spent nearly half a day before he finally pinpointed the exact location.</p><p></p><p>In a cave filled with hundreds of stalactites, Li Fan took a long time to identify the exact location where the entrance was.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the special terrain here also has a certain effect on concealing the spatial passages."</p><p></p><p>"It's quite to my liking."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded slightly, gently pointed, and a slight spatial fluctuation appeared in one of the stone pillars.</p><p></p><p>The Tianyang puppet, carrying Li Fan, flew into it.</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>There is one more chapter left, it will be about one and a half pages.</p><p></p><p>Brothers, don't wait.</p>

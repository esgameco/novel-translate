        <h1>Chapter 935</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>But for some reason, Li Fan vaguely felt familiar with this person's behavior, gestures, and way of speaking.</p><p></p><p>Especially the occasional cold light flashing in his eyes made Li Fan certain that he must have had contact with this person in some past life.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan watched, he searched for similar figures from the scenes recorded in the stone tablets of the Alchemy Path.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Alliance and the Five Elders' Council have been in confrontation for thousands of years, with victories and defeats. The Xuanhuang cultivators were affected by the wars, suffering immensely."</p><p></p><p>"In order to completely end this situation, many seniors pondered exhaustively and finally came up with a remarkably ingenious method."</p><p></p><p>With the words of the middle-aged cultivator, the epitome of the various provinces of the Immortal Alliance appeared before the eyes of the young men.</p><p></p><p>"As everyone knows, in each floating celestial city of the Immortal Alliance, there is a Tianzun Stone Statue. The vast majority of people believe that these were built to commemorate the great achievements of Tianzun. But have you ever thought that these statues might have other uses?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the young men all revealed looks of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"When you entered the headquarters of the Immortal Alliance, you should have sensed the residual aura left by the Passing Law Tianzun."</p><p></p><p>"And the construction of these stone statues was also instructed by the Passing Law Tianzun."</p><p></p><p>"Even the locations of each floating city were pre-determined by her."</p><p></p><p>"Within each statue, there remains a relic of Tianzun. If activated, it can unleash a power equivalent to a glimpse of Tianzun's strength..."</p><p></p><p>When the middle-aged cultivator reached this point, deliberately slowing down his speech, the young men also fell for it. Hearing just the term "a glimpse of Tianzun," they couldn't help but show some disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Passing Law Tianzun was powerful, just a glance at most, what difference could it make?</p><p></p><p>Seeing the expressions of the young men, the middle-aged cultivator smiled as expected.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a solemn expression, he exclaimed, "A glance of Tianzun can withstand a full-force attack from an ordinary Longevity Realm cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>His words echoed continuously, causing all thirty-three cultivators present to slowly widen their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible?" A young cultivator couldn't help but question on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"No matter how powerful the Passing Law Tianzun is, she is still within the Longevity Realm at the end of the day. How could there be such a huge difference among cultivators in the same realm?"</p><p></p><p>"If the elder is truly that strong, why didn’t she just unify the Xuanhuang Realm back then? Instead, leaving behind such a mess?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd immediately erupted into a commotion.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the authority of the middle-aged cultivator, the young men began to argue based on reason.</p><p></p><p>As the middle-aged cultivator's gaze swept over, under the familiar cold gaze enveloping Li Fan, each young man was forced to quiet down again.</p><p></p><p>"The considerations of Tianzun are beyond our comprehension. There were reasons why she didn’t unify the Xuanhuang Realm back then. But times are different now, and we have received clear instructions from Tianzun."</p><p></p><p>"It is time for the Xuanhuang Realm to have a unified voice."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged cultivator exuded a fierce aura.</p><p></p><p>"And all of you are the key to achieving this great goal."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged cultivator casually pointed, and the scene before the crowd changed once again.</p><p></p><p>The landscapes of the territories of the Immortal Alliance slowly disappeared, leaving only nearly a thousand shimmering points representing the celestial cities.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, silvery rays of light connected these bright points.</p><p></p><p>"Do you all see what this is?" the middle-aged cultivator asked.</p><p></p><p>Wei Qizheng was the first to speak, blurting out, "This... this looks just like the human meridians?!"</p><p></p><p>The other young men looked towards Wei Qizheng, then stared intently at the increasingly distinctive pattern of dots and lines in front of them.</p><p></p><p>They all suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p></p><p>An unbelieving thought couldn't help but emerge in their minds.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged cultivator confirmed their speculation by saying, "The remnants of Tianzun are distributed on the land of the Immortal Alliance according to the specific rules of human meridians. If activated using secret methods, one can summon a Dharma image based on the Passing Law Tianzun from the void."</p><p></p><p>"The remnants of Tianzun serve as the power source that drives the Dharma image."</p><p></p><p>"If all remnants can be activated..."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged cultivator took a deep breath. "The Five Elders' Council could be vanquished in no time!"</p><p></p><p>All thirty-three young men were dumbfounded at that moment.</p><p></p><p>"And you are the key to unlocking this formidable power..."</p><p></p><p>In the middle-aged cultivator's narration, the young men were all attracted, their eyes filled with eager anticipation.</p><p></p><p>The power of the remnants of Tianzun was too immense and could not be fully activated and inherited by just one cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Thus, it needed to be divided and distributed into thirty-three domains.</p><p></p><p>Each domain required an outstanding individual to preside over it.</p><p></p><p>When these thirty-three chosen immortals could achieve a state of complete harmony in their thoughts.</p><p></p><p>And as they continued to familiarize themselves with the remnants of Tianzun, they could act as a lever together, activating the power of the Tianzun remnants!</p><p></p><p>"You need to seize this opportunity, become familiar with and understand the mysteries within this process."</p><p></p><p>"And during this process, any one of you cannot afford to be distracted at all. You need to understand that at that time, it is essentially like all thirty-three of you controlling the Dharma image together."</p><p></p><p>"If there are any disagreements among you, it could lead to the disintegration of the Dharma image."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged cultivator elaborated on various matters regarding the Dharma image of Tianzun for the young men.</p><p></p><p>These thirty-three cultivators were all young heroes with aspirations and pride.</p><p></p><p>How difficult was it to make them act in unison?</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Immortal Alliance prepared a series of training sessions for them next.</p><p></p><p>Within a transparent sphere shimmering with silver light, there seemed to be countless rapidly evolving different worlds.</p><p></p><p>The consciousness of these thirty-three individuals was implanted into these worlds, experiencing various hardships.</p><p></p><p>There were turbulent times, mortal realms, ancient encounters in the immortal cultivation world, and possible future scenarios.</p><p></p><p>However, without exception, all thirty-three of them were forcibly merged into fetters. For various reasons, they converged together.</p><p></p><p>Only when they achieved a state of unity and harmony, akin to one entity, would they ultimately break free from the cycle of reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>And as long as any one of them had dissent, the cycle of reincarnation would start anew.</p><p></p><p>Even with the deliberate guidance of the Immortal Alliance, this was still a considerably long period of time.</p><p></p><p>Unaware of how many years had passed in the virtual realm, when these "youngsters" finally broke free from entrapment.</p><p></p><p>The youthfulness on their faces had vanished.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes were filled with vicissitudes.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, there was a sense of caution and confusion on their faces.</p><p></p><p>*Clap, clap, clap...*</p><p></p><p>Amidst the continuous clapping by the middle-aged cultivator, their suppressed memories from the past finally revived.</p><p></p><p>"Very good, now let's begin the second lesson." Without any regard for the thoughts of the young men, the middle-aged cultivator spoke up.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Following this, Wei Qizheng and the others endured even harsher training.</p><p></p><p>They were stripped naked and confined in a closed space with only endless darkness.</p><p></p><p>In the space, besides the simulated aura of the Passing Law Tianzun, there was nothing else.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 883</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The ocean below churns up towering waves.</p><p></p><p>The city built on the Nine-Headed Crimson Body continues to tremble. It seems like it could fall from the sky at any moment.</p><p></p><p>What shocked Xiaoqing and Xiaohong the most was that under this pressure, not to mention the exotic beasts driven by the Imperial Guards.</p><p></p><p>Even they themselves were overwhelmed with fear, unable to muster any thoughts of rebellion!</p><p></p><p>"The power gap is too vast. I'm afraid that even releasing that Fusion Beast wouldn't be this person's match!"</p><p></p><p>"If we forcefully resist, with just a thought, the empire could be easily destroyed."</p><p></p><p>Xiaoqing and Xiaohong looked at each other, helplessness and unwillingness evident in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"We can only flatter and bide our time for now."</p><p></p><p>They thought so.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, we are willing to surrender." Xiaoqing bit her silver teeth lightly and bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph. Don't think I don't know what you are thinking." Seeing this, Li Fan put away his holographic view of the cave.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept back and forth between Qing and Hong: "It's better to abandon your little schemes. The Union of Myriad Realms has been observing you for a long time now."</p><p></p><p>"I am well aware of all your so-called trump cards."</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's [Imperial One] in person, I am not afraid. Not to mention its poor imitation."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's words were arrogant to the extreme, but to Qing and Hong, who had no idea of Li Fan's true strength, they were shocked and raised their heads suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's profound gaze made their hearts turn cold.</p><p></p><p>The Fusion Beast of the myriad realms is an absolute secret of the empire.</p><p></p><p>Only the emperors of the past and these two knew about it.</p><p></p><p>However, this powerful figure from the Union of Myriad Realms, whom they had never heard of, actually knew as well?</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that mean they had no secrets in the eyes of the other party?</p><p></p><p>Even more crucially, they didn't know when the leak happened.</p><p></p><p>A sense of helplessness and fear surged in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Even when they were at the Beast Taming Sect long ago, facing experts of the Longevity Realm, they had never felt such powerlessness.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, take me to the Empire's treasury." Seeing that he had probed enough, Li Fan ordered casually.</p><p></p><p>With no will to resist left, Xiaoqing and Xiaohong had no choice but to obey Li Fan's command.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Li Fan arrived at the empire's treasury, containing countless treasures and information.</p><p></p><p>It was no different from what he had seen in the previous life.</p><p></p><p>After a brief tour, and another check on the condition of the Fusion Beast, Li Fan seemed to hit a dead end.</p><p></p><p>"Bring out the insights that Xu Ke researched on [Beast Wheel] back then."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan turned around, staring at Xiaoqing and Xiaohong, and spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>At this revelation, the two birds were utterly unable to remain calm.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you exactly?" Xiaoqing's beautiful eyes were full of shock, and her body couldn't help but tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>Knowing the name of their master, Xu Ke, and even knowing in detail about his research on the Beast Wheel, together with the words "Union of Myriad Realms," a possibility couldn't help but surface in Xiaoqing's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Beast Taming Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the inexplicable shock on the other party's face, Li Fan smiled grimly.</p><p></p><p>"What, are you planning to resist?"</p><p></p><p>"Well, I shall grant your wish."</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, Xu Ke, that boy, if he knew of your deaths, he must be feeling terrible." Li Fan sneered.</p><p></p><p>Xiaoqing and Xiaohong quickly said, "Senior, you've misunderstood..."</p><p></p><p>"Wait, what do you mean, senior?"</p><p></p><p>They looked at Li Fan with confusion.</p><p></p><p>"You guessed right, that boy Xu Ke is still alive." Li Fan snorted.</p><p></p><p>This news was too shocking, Xiaoqing and Xiaohong were almost unable to control their emotions and almost stumbled.</p><p></p><p>"Enough, stop dilly-dallying. Deathâ€¦"</p><p></p><p>"Or submission!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's impatience, Xiaoqing and Xiaohong felt a pang of fear.</p><p></p><p>"We..."</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Xiaoqing still handed over a jade pendant engraved with a blue phoenix.</p><p></p><p>This jade pendant belonged to Xu Ke originally, and she had been carrying it with her all these years.</p><p></p><p>Handing it over now, her eyes were full of reluctance.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the figure of Xu Ke vaguely appeared in her mind.</p><p></p><p>While she was lost in thought, Li Fan had already read through the contents of the jade pendant.</p><p></p><p>"Beast Wheel..."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed worthy of being the treasure of the Beast Taming Sect, it is truly extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>After the Beast Taming Sect relocated to the small world to seek refuge, they pulled out their elite disciples to research the Beast Wheel.</p><p></p><p>They attempted to find a way to control the demonic beasts without practicing the true art of Beast Taming.</p><p></p><p>Whether they succeeded or not, Li Fan didn't know.</p><p></p><p>But later, the fugitive Xu Ke managed to research the [Harmony Mantra] on his own, using it to control the exotic beasts in the empire's small world.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was already well aware of the Harmony Mantra.</p><p></p><p>What truly interested him was the intricacies of the Beast Wheel.</p><p></p><p>And Xu Ke, recognized by Mr. Bai, was truly a talent who established the imperial lineage.</p><p></p><p>The detailed information on the Beast Wheel in the jade pendant exceeded Li Fan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>"With such detailed information, when the Medicine King Cauldron returns, it might be possible to forge a weakened version of the Beast Wheel."</p><p></p><p>Though there was still a while before the return of the Medicine King Sect, Li Fan had already made arrangements for their tasks.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xiaoqing's dazed expression, Li Fan smiled and tossed the jade pendant back to her.</p><p></p><p>"I know about your plans to escape from the Profound Yellow Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"But I can tell you clearly, that's a suicidal path."</p><p></p><p>"Beyond the Endless Void, the danger is overwhelming. It surpasses the Profound Yellow Realm by far..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan sighed softly, then his expression turned serious: "Join us, the Union of Myriad Realms, in counterattacking the world of cultivation, reclaiming the Profound Yellow Realm, that's the only way to survive!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Li Fan's words, Xiaoqing became even more convinced of her judgment.</p><p></p><p>This Union of Myriad Realms, as expected, was formed by the ancient sects fleeing to various small worlds.</p><p></p><p>"This place of yours is a bit weak. But it has some unique aspects."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan commented briefly, then assigned tasks to them: "For example, the spiritual energy synthesis technique is very useful for many small worlds lacking spiritual energy."</p><p></p><p>"However, the efficiency is still too low."</p><p></p><p>"Even if all of you use the power of the whole world to cultivate exotic beasts, focusing solely on slaughtering them, it won't meet the needs of many small worlds."</p><p></p><p>"So..."</p><p></p><p>Feeling Li Fan's gaze, Xiaoqing and Xiaohong shivered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"At all costs, upgrade the spiritual energy synthesis technique."</p><p></p><p>"I will give you three years. After three years, I will come to inspect."</p><p></p><p>"If the results satisfy me, there will be rewards."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>"Wasting resources on useless people is better to die early."</p>

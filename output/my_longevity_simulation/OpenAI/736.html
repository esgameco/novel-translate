        <div class="content">
            <p>After listening to Li Fan's account, Huo Yuzhu cursed under her breath.</p><p></p><p>Then her expression softened and she looked at Li Fan, saying, "I have misunderstood you."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan seemed unconcerned and asked, "Do you have any clues about the control that I seem to be under, Sect Leader?"</p><p></p><p>After all, as the head of one of the ten major sects of the Immortal Path, even if only in name, he still possessed extraordinary insights.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Huo Yuzhu replied, "I have heard that the entire Ji family, as well as the entire world's Chamber of Commerce, were created by Ji Wangxian for the sake of cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Although Ji Wangxian himself has not broken through to the realm of immortality, almost all of his peers in cultivation have already died. Even if there are still some alive, who isn't showing signs of aging? Who else can maintain eternal youth and look like a young man like him?"</p><p></p><p>"This must be related to the cultivation method he practices. Although no one knows besides him what exactly this method entails, it almost certainly involves bloodlines and desires."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid that not just you, but all the cultivators of the Ji family, may be under Ji Wangxian's control," Huo Yuzhu said with a sinister tone.</p><p></p><p>"Then do you know the way to break free from his control?" Li Fan asked with a furrowed brow.</p><p></p><p>Huo Yuzhu did not answer immediately but seemed to be contemplating something as she paced back and forth.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not rush her, patiently waiting.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Huo Yuzhu stopped in her tracks. She then cast several restrictions with her hand, sealing off the secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>In a hushed tone, she said, "In our Heavenly Sword Sect, we have a secret technique. It imitates the method of forging swords, using the souls and flesh of cultivators as materials to forge the 'Supreme Sword Body.' If successful, the sword becomes the body, and the body becomes the sword, achieving a realm where man and sword are one."</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Sword Body repels all other foreign energies, so Ji Wangxian's control technique is bound to fail."</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Huo Yuzhu paused, "This method is too dangerous. Throughout the history of our Heavenly Sword Sect, only a few cultivators have succeeded, just a handful. Even our Senior Brother, with extraordinary talent, failed in the end and left behind some hidden dangers."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan showed no hesitation and said straightforwardly, "I am willing to give it a try."</p><p></p><p>Huo Yuzhu nodded slightly, showing approval, "If you can truly cultivate the Supreme Sword Body, then what harm would it be to let you take over as the next Sect Leader of the Heavenly Sword Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"In the cultivation world, strength is paramount. If I can be like Senior Brother Sītú, then it wouldn't hurt to become the Sect Leader," Li Fan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Huo Yuzhu was momentarily speechless.</p><p></p><p>After a detailed discussion in the secret chamber, the two finally reached a consensus.</p><p></p><p>Next, Li Fan continued to attract attention from all levels of the sect.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, unnoticed by anyone, Huo Yuzhu went to the Five Elements Sect.</p><p></p><p>As the Sect Leader of the Heavenly Sword Sect, Huo Yuzhu must have had her own supporters. Convincing the Sect Master of the Five Elements Sect to sell the 'Taiyuan Essence Gold' should not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, knowing in advance that there might be spies from the Chamber of Commerce within the Five Elements Sect, Huo Yuzhu would undoubtedly be more cautious and careful not to leak any information this time.</p><p></p><p>As expected, seven days later, Huo Yuzhu returned safely.</p><p></p><p>Without communicating anything with Li Fan, she only made eye contact, and everything was understood without words.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, with an ample supply of 'Taiyuan Essence Gold,' the progress of forging the boundary-breaking divine weapon was several times faster than expected. Li Fan no longer needed to draw insights from the wooden sword left by Mister Bai and infuse them into the sword embryo subsequently. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, he spent his days greedily absorbing the profound mysteries by the 'sword' without anyone questioning it.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan sensed that the time for his transition to the Immortal realm was running out,</p><p></p><p>the boundary-breaking divine weapon forged with the combined effort of the sect was finally completed.</p><p></p><p>The Ji family seemed to know about this in advance through some means and dispatched a group of cultivators led by Ji Shiwen to come, supposedly to celebrate.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, they were there to reap the rewards.</p><p></p><p>The colossal boundary-breaking divine weapon stood tall, looking like an ordinary grey stone, seemingly unremarkable.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan, who had spent all his days pondering by the 'sword,' could subtly sense the terrifying power emanating from within it.</p><p></p><p>Situ Yao gathered everyone from the Heavenly Sword Sect at the back mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Now that the divine weapon is complete, everyone has contributed to this achievement."</p><p></p><p>"I, Situ Yao, always keep my word. The one who contributed the most 'Taiyuan Essence Gold' will become the Sect Leader of the Heavenly Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Ji Shiwen's face lit up with joy.</p><p></p><p>However, Situ Yao's following words made him furious.</p><p></p><p>"According to the Elder Council's calculations, Huo Yuzhu has contributed a total of eighty-six thousand nine hundred twelve catties of 'Taiyuan Essence Gold,' the most among all!"</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, the next Sect Leader of the Heavenly Sword Sect will continue to be her!"</p><p></p><p>The scene fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible! How could anyone contribute more than our Ji family..." Ji Shiwen's voice broke the silence with anger.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Are you questioning me?" Situ Yao narrowed his eyes, staring at Ji Shiwen.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shiwen's words got stuck in his throat.</p><p></p><p>"Well then, let's make you accept the defeat. The Ji family has contributed a total of eighty-six thousand nine hundred eleven catties of 'Taiyuan Essence Gold.' Just one short..." Situ Yao shook his head slightly, looking very regretful.</p><p></p><p>Ji Shiwen's eyes were about to pop out of their sockets, trembling with anger. He pointed at Situ Yao, shivering with rage.</p><p></p><p>Situ Yao's face turned cold, "Ji brat, considering that you did contribute a significant amount of 'Taiyuan Essence Gold,' I won't hold you accountable for what you said earlier. But if you dare to speak out of line again..."</p><p></p><p>He coldly snorted, causing Ji Shiwen to shiver and keep his words to himself.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he seemed to remember something and looked towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Fan's incredulous and lost expression, he also became somewhat bewildered.</p><p></p><p>The selection of the future Sect Leader ended amidst such dramatic circumstances.</p><p></p><p>Following the departure of the guests, the Heavenly Sword Sect officially began moving towards the boundary-breaking divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>Everything that could be taken was taken.</p><p></p><p>Even the spiritual field outside the sect was dug up and moved as a whole.</p><p></p><p>The boundary-breaking divine weapon was called 'One Realm.'</p><p></p><p>So there was no need to worry about space constraints.</p><p></p><p>Only the wooden sword left by Mister Bai and the numerous flying swords left by the fallen predecessors of the Heavenly Sword Sect in the sword mound remained untouched under Situ Yao's command.</p><p></p><p>According to him, the sword intent was too strong and could clash with the boundary-breaking divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>As for why exactly, only he knew.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the day to depart for the boundary-breaking arrived.</p><p></p><p>The disciples transformed into sword lights, flying into the divine weapon in batches.</p><p></p><p>Situ Yao watched multiple breaths approaching rapidly, revealing a stern smile.</p><p></p><p>"I won't bother you all to send me off. The mess in the Xuanhuang Realm should be left for you to clean up. Our Heavenly Sword Sect doesn't have the ability to handle it."</p><p></p><p>He spoke loudly, "Oh, I forgot to tell you one thing. That brat Ji Wangxian is not to be trusted. He has planted quite a few nails in our ten major sects of the Immortal Path."</p><p></p><p>Situ Yao looked at a figure rapidly approaching in the distance, saying, "Zhaoyuan!" Ji Wangxian's voice came from afar.</p><p></p><p>With his words, as if uncontrollable, Li Fan suddenly flew towards Situ Yao.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, strange and vibrant colors emerged on his body.</p><p></p><p>Just when Li Fan was about to reach Situ Yao, he abruptly stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>Turning his head, he showed a mocking smile towards Ji Wangxian.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Ji Wangxian understood everything, his expression becoming increasingly angry.</p><p></p><p>However, Situ Yao grabbed Li Fan and fled into the boundary-breaking divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ji, thank you for sending us such a good seed for our Heavenly Sword Sect!" Situ Yao said with a grim expression.</p><p></p><p>Ji Wangxian's face was so dark that water seemed as though it could drip from it, as he extended his left hand, seeming to gather countless brass coins on it.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment, an extremely bright light burst from the boundary-breaking divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>The illusion of the brass coins instantly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Helplessly, he could only watch as a sword light tore through the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>The destructive force, seemingly able to sever time and space, forced him to flee a thousand miles away to avoid the edge.</p><p></p><p>After the light dissipated, the Heavenly Sword Sect and the boundary-breaking divine weapon had already disappeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

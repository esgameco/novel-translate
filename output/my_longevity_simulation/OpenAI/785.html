        <h1>Chapter 785</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Chen Tianhai's words held a deep meaning.</p><p></p><p>Could he have seen through the background of Xu Bai, who appeared to have a double identity?</p><p></p><p>However, he did not reveal it directly, maintaining a mysterious demeanor. This left Fang Zaiji feeling somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"However, what you said earlier is correct. We, as the Taiyan Sect, are indeed very interested in scenes outside the 'Xianxu'," Chen Tianhai spoke mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>"Or, one could say, any records beyond the realm of the Xuanhuang world are very important to us."</p><p></p><p>"What do you want to exchange?" Chen Tianhai changed the topic directly.</p><p></p><p>This caught Xu Bai somewhat off guard.</p><p></p><p>"I want the Dao Transformation Stone, the higher quality, the better," he quickly stated his requirement.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Transformation Stone..." Chen Tianhai pondered for a moment, but eventually shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"We don't have any individual Dao Transformation Stones left in our Taiyan Sect. Perhaps you could try your luck in the Xuanhuang main world."</p><p></p><p>"Change your request."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Fang Zaiji became unhappy: "Lao Chen, do you think our master is young and easy to bully? Clearly, the person who led us in earlier said, as long as we join your Taiyan Sect, a middle-grade Dao Transformation Stone will be given for free."</p><p></p><p>"Why is it different with you?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai glanced at Fang Zaiji, smiled, and said, "Brother Fang, you don't need to probe anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Just as you suspected..."</p><p></p><p>"Now, all of us rely on the 'Dao Transformation Stone Mother' for our existence."</p><p></p><p>Even though there had been some speculation before, when Chen Tianhai confessed it personally at that moment, Fang Zaiji couldn't help but shudder slightly.</p><p></p><p>"You...," Fang Zaiji began, but at that moment, Chen Tianhai's body suddenly turned blue and transparent again.</p><p></p><p>"In order to maximize the power of the Dao Transformation Stone Mother, we collected all the Dao Transformation Stones we could find. And since then, there has been no separation. So, your request, we really cannot fulfill," he looked at Xu Bai and admitted openly.</p><p></p><p>"Revolving around the Dao Transformation Stone Mother." Xu Bai did not seem too disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he silently observed Chen Tianhai's body.</p><p></p><p>After the initial shock, Fang Zaiji boldly reached out and touched Chen Tianhai's body.</p><p></p><p>Just as if a ray of light formed, there was nothingness.</p><p></p><p>His hand passed through.</p><p></p><p>"A dignified cultivator actually tolerates existing in this form?" He apparently had some difficulty accepting it.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, there's not much of a difference. On the contrary, it's more convenient. Would you like to try?" Chen Tianhai asked nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>Startled, Fang Zaiji quickly withdrew his hand.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is the current state of the entire Taiyan Sect? According to what you said, is the entire sect already an illusory existence? Then, what about the previous negotiations in the Wanxian Alliance, the allegiance, and settlement with the He Dao?" Fang Zaiji was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Between reality and illusion, we can freely transform. In the vast majority of cases, we exist in an illusory state. If necessary, we can show our physical form, indistinguishable from real cultivators," Chen Tianhai explained truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"However, doing so requires a significant amount of resources and the computational power of the Dao Transformation Stone Mother. Unless necessary, we won't do it."</p><p></p><p>"Normally, we only maintain the 'real' form of a dozen or so disciples."</p><p></p><p>"Can it really be done like this?" Fang Zaiji couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the method you came up with to survive the catastrophe back then?" Xu Bai asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't the price a bit too heavy? Being imprisoned on a stone for eternity. And once it shatters, there's the risk of collective downfall." Xu Bai asked bluntly.</p><p></p><p>"The catastrophe?" A hint of a fierce smile appeared on Chen Tianhai's face again.</p><p></p><p>"Surviving the catastrophe of 'Faith Cannot Practice Together,' our Taiyan Sect has dozens of ways."</p><p></p><p>"But that's not what we pursue."</p><p></p><p>With a transparent blue figure, hands behind his back, a sense of lofty ambition emerged in Chen Tianhai's voice.</p><p></p><p>"What we, the Taiyan Sect, seek is true 'transcendence.'"</p><p></p><p>"Even faced with the destruction of the Xianxu and the Xuanhuang world, we can still 'transcend' calmly."</p><p></p><p>These words shook Xu Bai and Fang Zaiji to their core.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji couldn't help but retort, "Relying solely on your Dao Transformation Stone Mother? You may not fully understand the terror of the Xianxu..."</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai, however, waved his hand without hesitation, cutting off Fang Zaiji's words.</p><p></p><p>"I know, the suction power of the Xianxu is strong enough to distort space and time."</p><p></p><p>"However, it is limited to that."</p><p></p><p>"It has not yet reached the point of destroying space and time."</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai lightly stamped his foot, and a blue light spread outward from under his foot.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the buildings and the entire floating city all became blue and transparent like Chen Tianhai. Upon closer inspection, within this blue color, countless scenes kept flashing, like the birth and destruction of worlds.</p><p></p><p>"Is this floating city the Dao Transformation Stone Mother?" Fang Zaiji asked in surprise after realizing his current situation.</p><p></p><p>Chen Tianhai didn't answer.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he said thoughtfully, "As long as space and time do not perish, information can always exist. Therefore, our Taiyan Sect can continue to exist."</p><p></p><p>"The Dao Transformation Stone Mother? There is no longer such a thing in the world."</p><p></p><p>"At that moment, we had already merged into one being."</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji opened his mouth but didn't say a word for a long time. Clearly, he was once again shocked by the madness of the Taiyan Sect.</p><p></p><p>"The perpetuity of space and time and information. It's truly a rare and extraordinary idea. Yet your Taiyan Sect has actually realized it. Truly remarkable," Xu Bai couldn't help but applaud.</p><p></p><p>"Although in regular ways, we cannot completely destroy you. However, in the Wanxian Alliance, there is your natural nemesis."</p><p></p><p>"The Tianxuan Mirror."</p><p></p><p>"With the ability of the Tianxuan Mirror, perhaps it cannot easily annihilate you. But it should be able to permanently trap you inside."</p><p></p><p>"In order to survive, it's not something disgraceful. Moreover, in a real battle, it might not go so well for Him. Currently, His primary task is to complete His own ascension. He naturally won't attack us. And since there's no conflict of interest between us, He willingly accepts our surrender," Chen Tianhai admitted, undisturbed.</p><p></p><p>"Those are fine words. But I have a question," Xu Bai stared directly at Chen Tianhai at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"How does your Taiyan Sect know that the 'Xianxu' cannot destroy space and time?"</p><p></p><p>"If the suction power of the 'Xianxu' has been continuously increasing over the years?"</p><p></p><p>"Just because it can't now doesn't mean it won't in the future."</p><p></p><p>Xu Bai spoke with a deep tone.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>At least, Wang Wan accepted the data calmly.</p><p></p><p>The black lines that formed his lower body showed no signs of movement at all.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention detaching and leaving.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I was lucky to draw the grand prize?" Li Fan's eyes flashed with a hint of gloom.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Wang Wan is not here for the first time using the Tianxuan Mirror to deduce divine abilities. Maybe I can ask him some questions."</p><p></p><p>Having completed the deduction of divine abilities, Li Fan's connection with the black lines connected to the platform below had been severed.</p><p></p><p>However, the countdown was still ongoing, so he had not been expelled from this space yet.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan did not rush to leave, instead observing the two people beside him and patiently waiting.</p><p></p><p>As time passed slowly, there was less than an hour left.</p><p></p><p>Deng Mingsi, who had not made a decision yet, seemed to be getting anxious.</p><p></p><p>She looked somewhat helpless, and in the end, seemed to make a choice that she was not satisfied with.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Wang Wan, like Li Fan, had completed the comprehension of divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>The connection with the lines under his feet was cut, and he opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Sensing Li Fan's gaze, Wang Wan seemed somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>However, communication was not possible here, so after giving a look, he turned his gaze back to Deng Mingsi.</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while, he shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The countdown reached zero.</p><p></p><p>A colorful light shone down from above.</p><p></p><p>The black and white lines gradually faded, and the surrounding space became lively.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, the scene before their eyes changed.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Li Fan and the others unconsciously found themselves back on the Lotus Stone Mountain outside Tianquan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Deng Mingsi released a burst of energy, fiercely hitting a nearby mountain.</p><p></p><p>However, this mountain was different from the ordinary ones, extremely hard.</p><p></p><p>Deng Mingsi couldn't even create a crack in it.</p><p></p><p>Tears welled up in her eyes involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>"Young lady, if you are greedy, you will fail!" Wang Wan sighed upon seeing this situation.</p><p></p><p>Through Li Fan's inquiries, he slowly learned about the peculiarities of this Endless Spirit Void Technique.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the divine tree generated in the minds of cultivators by the Tianxuan Mirror could not be completely comprehended by all cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Because it contained too many branches, ordinary cultivators could not comprehend it completely.</p><p></p><p>They could only select by luck.</p><p></p><p>Like Deng Mingsi, she was delayed in comprehending because she faced too many choices.</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, don't feel too discouraged, you are still young. Return in the next century. When I first came here, I was just like you, always wanting to choose the most suitable and powerful divine ability on that divine tree. In the end, I wasted a precious opportunity," Wang Wan continued to console Deng Mingsi.</p><p></p><p>Deng Mingsi was somewhat regretful, saying, "It's all because when I came, my brother secretly told me that the Tianxuan Mirror evaluates potential based on the overall view of the divine tree for cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"The more comprehensive the view, the greater the potential. When instilling divine abilities, the maximum power limit of the divine ability is also larger."</p><p></p><p>"I just thought that a little more viewing wouldn't hurt..."</p><p></p><p>As Deng Mingsi spoke, she seemed increasingly aggrieved, almost on the verge of tears.</p><p></p><p>"This brother of yours might not have good intentions after all," Li Fan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"What did you say!" Deng Mingsi suddenly froze, then looked at Li Fan in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Li Fan's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>"What did you mean by what you just thought?" Deng Mingsi stared at Li Fan intently, with an aggressive tone.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan restrained all his thoughts, squinting his eyes. "Friend Deng, I don't understand what you mean."</p><p></p><p>"Don't pretend, I can sense what others are thinking, especially when it concerns me!" Deng Mingsi said angrily, feeling even more enraged as Li Fan played dumb.</p><p></p><p>"What you just thought was that my brother had ill intentions. What does that mean?" Deng Mingsi continued to challenge Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"I can clearly sense what you're thinking. Brother Yingyu was really thinking for my good when he secretly told me this secret," Deng Mingsi said righteously.</p><p></p><p>"This little girl really knows nothing about the ways of the world," Li Fan thought to himself again.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Deng Mingsi, who noticed Li Fan's thoughts, blushed deeply.</p><p></p><p>"To actually sense what others are thinking. What a surprise," Li Fan was amazed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Once again tightening his thoughts and no longer teasing the young girl, he began to explain to her.</p><p></p><p>"If he really cared about you, he wouldn't have told you about this. He would just let you choose a divine ability that suits you. But inadvertently, he revealed it to you."</p><p></p><p>"He did this on purpose to stimulate your desire, causing you to return empty-handed this time!"</p><p></p><p>"As for the thoughts you sensed from the other party..."</p><p></p><p>"If he didn't know in advance about your ability to read minds, then perhaps what you sensed could have been true."</p><p></p><p>"But obviously, he is aware of your mind-reading ability. So what you sensed cannot be trusted."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Deng Mingsi wanted to argue.</p><p></p><p>But she suddenly froze because she sensed from Li Fan's mind a strong sense of protectiveness and pity.</p><p></p><p>Such intense and straightforward emotions were rare in her experience.</p><p></p><p>Deng Mingsi instantly blushed.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>She stomped her foot in extreme embarrassment, not daring to look at Li Fan again, and flew away.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." Li Fan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"If possible, friend, you should temporarily leave Tianquan Prefecture to avoid any trouble," Wang Wan, who had witnessed the whole process, couldn't help but remind them.</p><p></p><p>"Although it was an unintended slip, that little girl heard your thoughts. But after all, you did reveal Deng Qingyu's actions to her."</p><p></p><p>"This person has a narrow mind. Always seeking revenge for the slightest grievance," Wang Wan warned out of concern.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan nodded politely. "Oh? I wonder how the Deng family compares to the Xuan family?"</p><p></p><p>"Xuan..." Wang Wan was stunned at first, then his face changed drastically. "You are..."</p><p></p><p>"I am a mid-level guest in the Xuan family," Li Fan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I have said too much. The younger generation of the Deng family..." Wang Wan was somewhat speechless.</p><p></p><p>He quickly expressed his apologies to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>"No need to worry. Friend, you were just reminding me with good intentions." Li Fan dismissed it and left his contact information before flying away.</p><p></p><p>As he flew, Li Fan felt somewhat lucky.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that after so many days, I would encounter another cultivator who can read minds, just like the Heavenly Healer."</p>

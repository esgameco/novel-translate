        <h1>Chapter 737</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan saw Ji Wangxian's angry expression suddenly freeze on her face. Not only him, but the entire Xuanhuang Realm seemed to fall into a state of stillness.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the scenes accelerated at a thousand times the speed.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan saw several figures arriving slowly, engaging in a fierce battle with Ji Wangxian. In the end, Ji Wangxian retreated in a sorry state, seemingly seriously injured.</p><p></p><p>In this body of "Ji Zhaoxuan," his mind suddenly felt clear, and his body and mind relaxed.</p><p></p><p>After that, Li Fan saw that perhaps due to the influence of the boundary-breaking divine weapon tearing the Xuanhuang Realm, the Tianjian Mountain, which was originally abundant in spiritual energy and very suitable for cultivators to reside in, became unusually dangerous. Wind and thunder flashed, and black cracks occasionally split the space, resembling the scene Li Fan had seen in the boundary-breaking vortex in the real world.</p><p></p><p>And then...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan vaguely saw a figure in white clothes standing alone, silent in front of the boundary-breaking ruins. After a gentle wave of his hand, as if the wounds were suddenly healed, the visions gradually disappeared, and the space slowly stabilized.</p><p></p><p>After Mr. Bai completed all this, he did not stay but quickly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Moving forward, the scene began to change more rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators from different sects arrived to divide the territory of the Tianjian Sect. No one was willing to compromise, leading to a large-scale war.</p><p></p><p>Disasters struck, and numerous cultivators started killing each other.</p><p></p><p>The sky darkened, and everywhere were the bones of cultivators. There were no signs of living people for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"These..." Li Fan asked with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>"Are these scenes of the future?" After the distorted scene became completely invisible, Li Fan looked towards Situ Yao beside him and asked in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Situ Yao was still carefully watching the scene outside the divine weapon, and after a while, he shifted his gaze.</p><p></p><p>Drinking up from his gourd, Situ Yao said, "It's not the future, it's the present."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's gaze sharpened.</p><p></p><p>The external scenes became completely dark, like a lost traveler walking into the night. What awaited the Tianjian Sect was an entirely unknown fate.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, can we really succeed in breaking through the boundary?" In the darkness, with countless ferocious beasts seemingly lurking and ready to prey on people, an inexplicable fear and unease rose in Li Fan's heart, and he couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Situ Yao sighed again, "Who knows. After all, we should be the first ones to attempt crossing the boundary in the Xuanhuang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"If it doesn't work out, we can always choose death. Staying here, we probably won't live long anyway."</p><p></p><p>As if echoing Situ Yao's words, the inside of the boundary-breaking divine weapon suddenly darkened.</p><p></p><p>And then fell into stillness.</p><p></p><p>Shattering inch by inch like a mirror.</p><p></p><p>Back in the distorted space, Li Fan looked at the three dimly lit clusters ahead and fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"With just a brief moment inside the boundary-breaking divine weapon, several decades or even hundreds of years have passed in the outside world. It seems incredibly similar to the Immortal Ruins. Perhaps only the same power that distorts time and space can break free from the shackles of the Immortal Ruins."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, Li Fan finally returned to the real world.</p><p></p><p>Since he had fulfilled Ji Zhaoxuan's long-cherished wish, there should be some rewards.</p><p></p><p>Upon inspection, Li Fan was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>It was not the "Breath Condensing Sword Art" that Ji Zhaoxuan practiced, but a pile of sword embryo element stones.</p><p></p><p>With a strange look on his face, Li Fan counted and found a total of three hundred and twenty-six of them.</p><p></p><p>Taking one out casually, he held it in his hand.</p><p></p><p>In a trance, insights about the way of the sword kept flooding his mind, and he felt a slight familiarity. As if he had once mastered it himself.</p><p></p><p>"These should be the sword embryo element stones that Ji Zhaoxuan had absorbed in the true history, condensed with the true meaning of the sword. For sword cultivators, they may be valuable. But for me, they are of little use."</p><p></p><p>"With someone like Xu Bai, a humanoid enlightenment machine, give him an ordinary wooden sword, and he can comprehend it himself. It just takes a bit of time."</p><p></p><p>"It's the material of these stones that is good. They can be used as forging materials for the boundary-breaking divine weapon or to strengthen the Xuanhuang True Cauldron, to endure longer when charging into the Immortal Ruins in the future."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan kept half of them and threw the remaining more than a hundred pieces to Fang Zaiji.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zaiji was completely immersed in the study of the "End Stone Disk" at this time, directing Jiang Yushan and Liu San to carefully cut the stone disk. He casually stored the sword embryo element stones without looking at them much.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan observed for a while without disturbing them.</p><p></p><p>He then returned to the secret room.</p><p></p><p>"In the Catastrophic Immortal Realm, the harvest is closely related to the resolution of obsession. The value of these sword embryo element stones in the 'Tianjian Sect Sword Forging' scene is ordinary. It seems that the owner maintaining that time and space isn't Ji Zhaoxuan."</p><p></p><p>However, with some insight in his mind, after thinking for a while, Li Fan temporarily put it aside.</p><p></p><p>He took out the two relics of Huangfu Song, the "Separation Disc" and the "Quantum Mirror."</p><p></p><p>He first carefully observed the Quantum Mirror.</p><p></p><p>It had turned into an ordinary mirror, showing no response no matter how his divine sense interacted with it.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it was borrowed from Huangfu Song and Jihongdao. When we reported the news of Huangfu Song's death to the World Pavilion, they didn't ask to take it back. It should be like the Tianxuan mirrors in each state, once the empowering essence is withdrawn, it will lose its miraculous properties."</p><p></p><p>He felt a little regretful as he played with it in his hand.</p><p></p><p>He then focused his attention on the "Separation Disc."</p><p></p><p>The difference was small, and if not carefully observed, it might be easily overlooked.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan knew that the other eight Separation Discs had already begun to iterate and evolve.</p><p></p><p>He murmured to himself, "Huangfu, it's not that I didn't preserve it for you, it vanished by itself. It's not my fault."</p><p></p><p>In his mind, Li Fan held the Separation Disc in his palm.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the crystalline stone in his brain emitted a bright blue light, and numerous basic standardized arrays were input into the Separation Disc. </p><p></p><p>In the normal cultivation process, a cultivator would have to sketch out the basic framework of the array in their mind and then infuse it with their divine sense. While basic arrays required minimal effort from a formation master, as the arrays got more complex, more energy and time would be needed. However, with the "Dao of Alchemy" secret technique, Li Fan did not have this worry.</p><p></p><p>Since learning formations from Zhang Zhiliang, he had preserved numerous different arrays in his alchemy stone. There was no need to recall or sketch them out himself; he could easily access them at will.</p><p></p><p>Initially, this advantage didn't seem significant.</p><p></p><p>However, as the Separation Disc evolved and required more complex formations, the difference would slowly become apparent.</p><p></p><p>Of course, those who could exchange for a Separation Disc in this world were all exceptional individuals.</p><p></p><p>The remaining eight people should each have their unique techniques.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't underestimate any of them.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the "Dao of Alchemy," he had other backing.</p><p></p><p>()</p>

Already done."</p><p></p><p>The voice of the transmitter, Jiang, was indifferent and echoed constantly in this pale space.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the shocked expressions on the faces of all other transmitters were barely concealed.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Jiang actually took action himself?"</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, it seems he is really interested in this divine and demonic idea."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed. Speaking of which, this is the first time since the establishment of the Immortal Alliance that Jiang has left his 'Return Ruins World'."</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, the other party is lucky."</p><p></p><p>"Hurry, keep an eye on the real-time latest visuals. I can't wait to see Brother Jiang show his might!"</p><p></p><p>Like a boiling pot, the pale space burst open instantly.</p><p></p><p>The originally calm transmitters all had excited, eagerly anticipating expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>In a small world resembling a human city, a transmitter named Feng, also known as Moru Bin, couldn't help but feel a shadow in his heart.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Be careful."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was controlling millions of divine and demonic beings.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, one of the divine and demonic beings issued a weak warning.</p><p></p><p>But Li Fan, who controlled the overall situation, did not ignore it.</p><p></p><p>Instead, his expression turned extremely serious.

If he dispersed without a grandiose show, it would be somewhat regrettable!</p><p></p><p>"Let me see who it is that can make the Law King of the Mystery Schools so nervous."</p><p></p><p>With a single step, Li Fan arrived in front of the faceless true immortal stone statue in the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>The golden wish power wrapped around him slowly emerged.</p><p></p><p>It was covered with a layer of clothes woven from golden threads.</p><p></p><p>As the wish power extended, it formed a protective shield, enclosing Li Fan's true self within.</p><p></p><p>"By this, I am invincible."</p><p></p><p>"If I am truly defeated, I'm afraid the entire Xuanyellow Realm will be buried with me!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan squinted, crossed his legs, and sat down.</p><p></p><p>He waited patiently for the arrival of the other party.</p>

            <p>It is not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>Leaving aside how to plan and manage, and how to successfully complete the construction of the continuous architectural complex.</p><p></p><p>Just talking about how to design a building that lives up to the five characters of "World Union Association" requires some effort.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Li Fan once presided over the reconstruction work of the Cloud Heaven City.</p><p></p><p>In this aspect, he has some experience.</p><p></p><p>He had also had some communication with the architects sent by the Immortal Alliance headquarters to support.</p><p></p><p>So, to be fair, the blueprint designed by Li Fan himself is not too bad.</p><p></p><p>It's just that...</p><p></p><p>Li Fan always feels like something is missing.</p><p></p><p>"After all, I am not a professional."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that I need to find a reliable person to supervise this matter."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan cannot stay in the Spirit Wood Realm forever.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Ling's strength has made great progress and has received a lot of resources support from the Five Elders Association, it is time to consider the Heavenly Sun Harmony Plan.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had a detailed understanding of the information of the Heavenly Essence with the information obtained from Mr. Bai, he still cannot guarantee that everything will be foolproof and must still bear considerable risks.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the more prepared, the better.</p><p></p><p>If the Heavenly Sun Harmony succeeds, Li Fan will have to consider formally devouring the Five Elements Great Cave Heaven and return to the Nascent Soul Realm.</p><p></p><p>It is almost certain that he will be extremely busy and occupied. 69shu.com</p><p></p><p>So, before that, he needs to find a reliable person to be in charge of the construction of the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Various information about many cultivators flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Li Fan locked onto his target.</p><p></p><p>Master Builder, Ou Daozi.</p><p></p><p>Although he only had the cultivation of the Nascent Soul stage, he possessed talents and insights into architectural design that were difficult for others to attain.</p><p></p><p>It is said that many of the buildings inside the Immortal Alliance headquarters were created by him.</p><p></p><p>Even the rebuilding and renovation of the Immortal Alliance Heavenly City consulted Ou Daozi's opinion.</p><p></p><p>However, he was dissatisfied when the blueprint design was completed and was forcibly deprived of his memory by the Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, he chose to retreat to the mountains and forests and no longer contribute to the Immortal Alliance in any way.</p><p></p><p>Even without any official position, Ou Daozi was not someone Li Fan could easily invite at this moment.</p><p></p><p>So Li Fan planned to directly use the "True Fruit of Temptation."</p><p></p><p>Ou Daozi's personal strength was not weak, and coupled with his unique talent, it would not be a waste.</p><p></p><p>The only difficulty lay in how to deceive and persuade him to swallow the True Fruit of Temptation.</p><p></p><p>With his experience, Li Fan prepared several plans and decided to act accordingly.</p><p></p><p>If all else failed, he could only resort to coercion.</p><p></p><p>After staying in the Spirit Wood Realm for a few more days, he put away the one hundred Immortal Alliance entry exam questions that Shang Tianci had provided.</p><p></p><p>Then, he set off with Lin Ling and Tianyang. 69shu.com</p><p></p><p>They continued to travel along the flow of the Earth's veins.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that with Lin Ling, their travels in the Xuanhuang Realm had become much more convenient.</p><p></p><p>After half a day, they reached their destination.</p><p></p><p>Guanglan Province, Reviving Mountain.</p><p></p><p>This province was located in the south of the Immortal Alliance, relatively remote and not very prosperous. It was almost on the same level as the Cloud Heaven Sea region.</p><p></p><p>However, within this province, the Reviving Mountain was quite famous.</p><p></p><p>Originally named "Bao Yuan Mountain," about two years ago, the peaceful Guanglan Province was suddenly shaken by a great commotion.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of cultivators witnessed the Bao Yuan Mountain collapse with a deafening roar.</p><p></p><p>The vision lasted for nearly half a day, and it was unknown how many cultivators in the mountain failed to escape in time and tragically died.</p><p></p><p>Just as the cultivators were still in shock, something that left them stunned happened.</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of countless cultivators, the collapsed Bao Yuan Mountain, which had sunk underground and turned into a deep abyss, surprisingly reappeared under a yellow light!</p><p></p><p>The situation at that time was like a shattered porcelain being restored; or like the tea that had been poured into the river returning to the cup.</p><p></p><p>As if time had reversed, the previously ruined Bao Yuan Mountain had returned to its original state!</p><p></p><p>Such an extraordinary event was bound to cause a great sensation.</p><p></p><p>However, even though the mountain reappeared, the effects of its collapse had not disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators who tragically died in the mountain collapse and the upheaval caused by the mountain's collapse were undeniable.</p><p></p><p>After extensive investigation and argument, most cultivators, even if they didn't believe it, accepted the fact.</p><p></p><p>They became more curious about how such an extraordinary event had occurred.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Alliance was no exception.</p><p></p><p>They dispatched several investigation teams and thoroughly searched through the Bao Yuan Mountain.</p><p></p><p>But they still couldn't find the cause.</p><p></p><p>As time passed without progress, the Immortal Alliance had to temporarily give up the extensive investigation.</p><p></p><p>They left only one investigator to stay and watch over things.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, cultivators who had heard about the incident came to investigate out of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Because the Bao Yuan Mountain now had a new name, "Reviving Mountain."</p><p></p><p>However, the scenery of Reviving Mountain was ordinary and lacked any attraction. Over time, fewer and fewer people came. It gradually faded from people's memories.</p><p></p><p>Before, when Li Fan was reincarnated, he had taken the time to explore here.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't find anything unusual.</p><p></p><p>This time, if it weren't for Ou Daozi, he wouldn't have revisited the place.</p><p></p><p>After learning the specific location of Ou Daozi, Li Fan and his companions headed straight for Reviving Mountain.</p><p></p><p>When they arrived, they found that the hut in the mountains was already deserted.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Li Fan couldn't help but furrow his brows.</p><p></p><p>Using his divine sense to scan the hut and carefully examine the traces, Li Fan discovered that the other party had left not long ago.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, besides Ou Daozi, there seemed to be traces of another person living there.</p><p></p><p>"It's a child, should be Ou Daozi's son," recalling the information, Li Fan made a judgment.</p><p></p><p>"But why did they leave in such a hurry..."</p><p></p><p>"Are they avoiding some enemies?" Li Fan rubbed his chin.</p><p></p><p>"Master, are you looking for the people in this hut? I can find them," Lin Ling spoke up proactively while Li Fan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What method do you have?" Li Fan became interested.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he tried to track Ou Daozi's trail, but the latter intentionally erased his own traces to avoid being followed.</p><p></p><p>"There are many trees in the mountains, I can ask them," Lin Ling said shyly.</p><p></p><p>With Li Fan's approval, Lin Ling excitedly began to use her technique.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, tiny green dots of light swarmed from all over Reviving Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Forming a river of green light that flowed into Lin Ling's body.</p><p></p><p>"I see them!"</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Lin Ling clapped joyfully and flew off.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan and Tianyang followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>"It's interesting that they didn't escape through the Heavenly City transmission array but fled into the remote mountains and forests."</p><p></p><p>"Is it a hasty escape, or..."</p>

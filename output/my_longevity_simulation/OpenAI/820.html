        <h1>Chapter 820</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Teams of black-robed cultivators, passing through various states via teleportation arrays, arrived at the battlefield. These cultivators, their origins unknown, all had at least a cultivation level of Yuan Ying realm. Leading the group were Nascent Soul realm cultivators, with formidable combat prowess displayed.</p><p></p><p>It had been hundreds of years since any major conflict in the mysterious Huang realm. However, these cultivators seemed experienced in battle, emitting a heavy aura of slaughter. Their coordination was seamless, and their attacks were fierce.</p><p></p><p>A group of four or five Yuan Ying cultivators could besiege a Nascent Soul cultivator. When the leader, a Dao Fusion cultivator, made a move, even the Five Elders of Dao Fusion would retreat step by step.</p><p></p><p>The situation on the battlefield quickly turned in their favor. Hidden in the Stone Linzhou, Li Fan happened to witness the actions of these black-robed cultivators, and what left the deepest impression on him was the Dao Fusion cultivator leading them.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had condensed the thunder from the sky into a long spear held in his hand. The entire Stone Linzhou was illuminated in an instant. The silver spear was like a dragon, stirring up the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan, who watched from a distance, was affected. It felt like being amidst a stormy sea, surrounded by the sharp cries of spiritual energy surges, with his own spiritual power forced into resonance, causing his movements to slow down.</p><p></p><p>Before the strike was even unleashed, groups of Dao Fusion cultivators fell from the sky, only to be stopped by a wooden fan in the end, preventing the complete annihilation of the Five Elders of Dao Fusion.</p><p></p><p>"This move seems familiar. Wu?" Li Fan couldn't help but squint his eyes in thought.</p><p></p><p>Before he could dwell further, unexpected changes occurred on the battlefield. The Five Elders of Dao Fusion, who were facing setbacks in their actions, immediately chose to retreat collectively, as if they had preplanned it.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the Dao Fusion cultivator carrying the wooden fan, there was another man sitting nonchalantly on a wooden wheelchair, unfolding a map that instantly set up various formations on the battlefield, delaying and obstructing the pursuit of the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance.</p><p></p><p>With swift organization, the Five Elders quickly retreated like a tide, leaving behind a devastated battlefield that spoke of the recent warfare.</p><p></p><p>"It seems more like a probing than a full-scale war. If victory could be achieved in one battle, that would be better."</p><p></p><p>"On the contrary, it's a hit-and-run," Li Fan gazed at the battered Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance cultivators on the ground of the Stone Linzhou, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>Facing the orderly retreat of the Five Elders, the black-robed cultivators who came to aid did not choose to pursue. They stood in the air for a while, preventing any sudden turns in the situation before finally disappearing in black light.</p><p></p><p>Although the timely arrival of the black-robed cultivators prevented a complete collapse of the situation, the rapid defeat that had occurred earlier still left the entire Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance seething with anger.</p><p></p><p>The protective formations in various areas were swiftly changed from the "Heavenly Origin Rebirth Formation" to the more defensive "Ten Thousand Mountains and Rivers Formation." Additionally, the Strategy Hall of the Immortals Alliance began a thorough investigation from top to bottom.</p><p></p><p>There was no doubt that the breach in the defense formations, which allowed the Five Elders to easily break through, was connected to leaks from the top ranks of the Strategy Hall. Regular formation masters only knew a small part of the larger formations, but to understand all the vulnerabilities of the defense formations in such detail, it had to be someone from the highest echelons of the Strategy Hall.</p><p></p><p>If this person was not removed, no matter how the defensive formations changed in the future, they would always appear transparent to the enemy, signaling a grave issue.</p><p></p><p>Not only the headquarters of the Immortals Alliance but the Strategy Halls of various states also witnessed the abduction of formation masters for investigation.</p><p></p><p>Although the Five Elders temporarily retreated, the Ten Thousand Immortals Alliance was now thrown into intense turmoil.</p><p></p><p>In the Cloud Mist Sea, on the Seagate Island, Ji Shaoli enthusiastically welcomed the Cloud Mist Sea cultivators attending the gathering. Most of them were stationed on various islands, while some worked on the Ten Thousand Immortals Island. With the current tense situation, they were all extremely busy.</p><p></p><p>Being able to spare time for today's banquet was already a great show of respect for Ji Shaoli.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that a few friends from the Strategy Hall did not grace us with their presence today," Ji Shaoli expressed regret.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected even the 'Protective Grand Array,' such a top-secret formation, to be betrayed. It speaks volumes about how corrupted the top ranks of the Strategy Hall have become."</p><p></p><p>"I heard that to quell this issue, the Chief Formation Master of the Strategy Hall, Lu Xichan, has voluntarily requested to step down. Tut tut..."</p><p></p><p>"In my opinion, it's not just the Strategy Hall. The entire upper echelon of the Immortals Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Zhong, be careful with your words..."</p><p></p><p>All present held positions within the Immortals Alliance system. Ji Shaoli's opening remark sparked lively discussions among the group, which turned more taboo and sensitive as it progressed.</p><p></p><p>They mutually agreed to halt the conversation in time before it caused any trouble.</p><p></p><p>"As we speak, Ji, your demeanor has changed. There used to be quite a few beautiful female cultivators accompanying you on the island. Why haven't we seen any today?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Ji recently released a group of them. We thought he was looking for new companions, but it seems surprising that he hasnâ€™t taken any action even after so long. It's quite unusual, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>Facing the curious and questioning gazes around him, Ji Shaoli sighed and said, "No more than being tired of it!"</p><p></p><p>"After indulging in worldly pleasures, one eventually feels a sense of emptiness."</p><p></p><p>"Especially when the war broke out inexplicably some time ago, a good friend of mine from the Stone Linzhou suddenly fell. It made me more alert."</p><p></p><p>"Compared to pleasure, one's cultivation level is more important. With the situation changing daily, no one knows which direction it will take. The higher the cultivation realm, the higher the chance of survival in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli's words resonated with many present, as they nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Although we are located on the border at the Cloud Mist Sea, we are adjacent to the territory of the Five Elders. Perhaps one day they might come knocking. We must be prepared!"</p><p></p><p>However, this also worried many, "Most of us are only at the Foundation Establishment or Golden Core realm. If a major conflict breaks out, we may indeed be like floating leaves in the wind..."</p><p></p><p>Ji Shaoli timely interjected, "Life and death are not within our control!"</p><p></p><p>The phrase "life and death are not within our control" stirred the cultivators present, their expressions varied.</p><p></p><p>Turning the conversation, Ji Shaoli said, "This is another reason I invited you all here."</p><p></p><p>"You all know that I won the 'Fish Lock' grand prize, and have amassed a considerable wealth."</p><p></p><p>The attention of the cultivators was instantly drawn to him. It was clear that without such fortune, how could they expect Ji Shaoli to be so kind to them?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, they thought that in crucial moments, they could borrow some contributions from him.</p><p></p><p>"I also have some understanding of investments. Although I have indulged in pleasures and spent a lot in recent years, my overall wealth has doubled."</p><p></p><p></p>

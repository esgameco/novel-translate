        <h1>Chapter 804</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Li Fan did not go to the Ten Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he quietly came to the entrance of the Boundary Realm first.</p><p></p><p>Passing through the spatial channel, Li Fan flew directly to the vicinity of the volcano at the center of the Boundary Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the scorching air, there was a strong smell of sulfur.</p><p></p><p>Nearby, one could faintly see the raging lava and traces that had not completely cooled.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like this volcano had just experienced a violent eruption.</p><p></p><p>Hovering in mid-air, Li Fan carefully observed the volcano.</p><p></p><p>The strange feeling in his heart grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, something is amiss."</p><p></p><p>After a while, a strange look appeared in Li Fan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because he had advanced to the Nascent Soul realm, having a celestial cave within him.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps because he had merged with a small world's Dao using Xu Bai's body.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's perception of "celestial cave, small world" had become much sharper.</p><p></p><p>Through his observation this time, he immediately realized where the strange feeling he had whenever he saw this Boundary Realm volcano came from.</p><p></p><p>"This volcano doesn't belong to the Boundary Realm at all. It comes from another small world!"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder there has always been a sense of disharmony!"</p><p></p><p>In fact, the surrounding terrain already hinted at the problem.</p><p></p><p>On the vast plain stood a violent volcano.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, it was highly abnormal.</p><p></p><p>However, mortals would attribute it to the great power of nature.</p><p></p><p>But cultivators like Li Fan could indeed discover the reason behind it.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan became interested.</p><p></p><p>"What is going on? Why did a volcano from another small world suddenly appear in the Boundary Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan casually set up protections around himself and then flew into the mouth of the volcano.</p><p></p><p>The scorching and churning magma couldn't harm him at all.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan delved deep into the volcano, attempting to find the source of the anomaly from within.</p><p></p><p>It was only when he reached the bottom, at the intersection of the volcano and the earth veins, that he finally made some gains.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan reached out and held a strand of earth fire in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Even with his mid-level Golden Elixir realm protection, he still felt a bit burnt.</p><p></p><p>"It's not spiritual energy. But it is indeed a kind of extraordinary power."</p><p></p><p>"The Boundary Realm is a purely mortal world, without the conditions to produce this kind of earth fire."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan put the earth fire back and carefully observed this space.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the volcano mouth, the flowing magma here was more gentle and calm.</p><p></p><p>It just occasionally bubbled.</p><p></p><p>At the edge of the magma sea, there was a subtle, indistinct boundary line.</p><p></p><p>Hidden in the orange-red magma, it was inconspicuous.</p><p></p><p>If not deliberately searched for, its existence could easily be overlooked.</p><p></p><p>From this boundary line, a power similar to the earth fire could be faintly felt.</p><p></p><p>"Another spatial channel?"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation and setting up protective formations around him, he leaped into it.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In a flash, as soon as he entered, a fireball came hurtling towards Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>However, the power was not great and was deflected by the protective formation.</p><p></p><p>Initially thinking it was an attack, Li Fan's mind tensed.</p><p></p><p>But upon closer inspection, he relaxed. He was momentarily captivated by the scenery of this world.</p><p></p><p>It was a completely lifeless world, purely belonging to "fire."</p><p></p><p>There were frequent loud explosions.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the lava shooting up towards the sky and bursting apart in the air.</p><p></p><p>Countless crimson fire lines streaked across, smashing in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Falling into the magma sea, they triggered a new round of chain reactions.</p><p></p><p>Fire was the eternal theme of this world.</p><p></p><p>Not only beneath the endless magma sea could one find numerous independent fire seeds resembling flowers.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, there were also giant flames floating with the wind, forming various patterns like on a canvas.</p><p></p><p>Various colors and forms.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the most powerful flames even made Li Fan feel slightly challenged.</p><p></p><p>And that's where it stopped.</p><p></p><p>After spending some time exploring this world fully, Li Fan couldn't help but feel a bit regretful, "The power level here is at most the late Golden Elixir realm."</p><p></p><p>"If I were in the Nascent Soul realm, even if the world's fire here burned me together, it wouldn't cause me any damage."</p><p></p><p>"Valuable. But not that significant."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan shook his head slightly. In his estimation, even for cultivators more interested in the power of fire attributes, they would not pay more than two thousand contribution points for this world.</p><p></p><p>These contribution points were something Li Fan didn't care much about.</p><p></p><p>"Feeling disappointed!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan lost interest.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to return to the Boundary Realm through the same spatial channel, he suddenly remembered something and stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, he changed direction and flew towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Flying all the way to the edge of the world, close to the endless void.</p><p></p><p>Looking down, he faintly saw the full picture of this world.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that near the spatial channel leading to the Boundary Realm, the terrain of the lava sea was somewhat different from other places.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have been severely impacted.</p><p></p><p>And gazing further into the void, he could vaguely see the scenery of the Boundary Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan immediately understood, "These are two small worlds in two different voids that have collided for some unknown reason."</p><p></p><p>"A part of the Fire World is deeply embedded within the Boundary Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Two sides of the same coin. And as time passes, the two will gradually merge and become indistinguishable."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan quickly returned to the magma sea below.</p><p></p><p>"The power level of this Fire World is obviously far beyond that of the mortals in the Boundary Realm."</p><p></p><p>"With one side strong and the other weak, in the long run, the fate awaiting the Boundary Realm is to be consumed and assimilated."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>However, he suddenly thought of the extraordinary talents displayed by Su Xiaomei, Su Heng, Ye Feipeng, and others from the Boundary Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the 115th era, he had initially trapped them on Shenhua Island.</p><p></p><p>And later, imprisoned them in the Valley of Medicine King for many years.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, when they could train again, he found that everyone in the Boundary Realm had lost their spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Li Fan had expelled them from the Valley of Medicine King.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see if they could show their talents again and plan to see if they could create something extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, until the end of the world, he heard no news about them.</p><p></p><p>They seemed to become irrelevant.</p><p></p><p>"The talents of the Boundary Realm residents do not come from within themselves."</p><p></p><p>"Instead..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan remembered the birth of Su Xiaomei.</p><p></p><p>"She had a mother but no father, conceived through a heavenly decree."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>He found the crux of the problem, passed through the spatial channel beneath the volcano, and returned to the Boundary Realm.</p><p></p><p>In a short time, he found his target in the residence of the Grand Academy Chancellor in the capital.</p><p></p><p>It was Su Xiaomei's mother, Su Yuqing.</p><p></p><p>At that time, she was not yet pregnant.</p><p></p><p>In her teens, her innocent face was full of purity.</p><p></p><p>She was playing with the butterflies fluttering on the flowers in the backyard.</p><p></p><p>Looking at her, a familiar feeling surged in Li Fan's heart instantaneously.</p>

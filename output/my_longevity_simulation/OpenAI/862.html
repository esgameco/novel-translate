        <h1>Chapter 862</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the center of Li Fan's lower abdomen, as the primordial power of the world's source was continuously extracted, the colorful round bead seemed to have dimmed a bit.</p><p></p><p>But in contrast, the sky-covering roots of the earth penetrated deep into every corner of the Five Elements' Grand Immortal Cave.</p><p></p><p>The roots of the earth nourished by the source power were somewhat different from those derived from the spiritual power of ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>They became more ferocious, and...</p><p></p><p>more greedy.</p><p></p><p>As if savoring the taste, they did not need Li Fan to manipulate them too much.</p><p></p><p>With just a thought, the densely packed black tentacles eagerly expanded towards untouched virgin areas.</p><p></p><p>The vibrant and colorful world of the cave gradually darkened.</p><p></p><p>It fell into a haunting darkness.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan watched this scene with an indescribable feeling, even a premonition arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Even without deliberate manipulation, the strengthened roots of the earth could complete the devouring process in a short time.</p><p></p><p>"The merging of worlds..."</p><p></p><p>"When Primordial Master created a new law, he must have witnessed scenes of world fusion." Li Fan realized.</p><p></p><p>He didn't care about the loss of the colorful round bead.</p><p></p><p>He accelerated the speed of devouring to the limit.</p><p></p><p>Three months later.</p><p></p><p>"It's time."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The black roots had completely entwined the Five Elements' Grand Immortal Cave.</p><p></p><p>Looking from outside the void, all that could be seen was a weird ball covered with countless tentacles.</p><p></p><p>There was no longer the magnificent, grand, vibrant Immortal Cave.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, numerous roots immediately sprang to life from below.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements' Grand Immortal Cave trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>The pure and abundant vitality was transmitted to Li Fan's body through the roots.</p><p></p><p>The originally over twenty-year-old body seemed to regress back to its teenage years in an instant.</p><p></p><p>And every part of his body - tissues, bones, and flesh - underwent earth-shattering changes under the pure and vital force.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Li Fan adapted to the overwhelming vitality.</p><p></p><p>Squinting his eyes, he calmly drew a deep bloodline on his arm, almost revealing the bone inside.</p><p></p><p>Despite the severity of the injury, the wound healed at a visible speed after just a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>It was noteworthy that Li Fan had not formally devoured the Grand Immortal Cave of the Primordial Infant yet.</p><p></p><p>Just relying on the feedback of vitality from the Immortal Cave, he had achieved such a level!</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the initial Immortal Cave, this is much stronger." Li Fan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>As his body slowly dissolved, transforming into flowing ink, it surged towards the Five Elements' Grand Immortal Cave along the countless tentacles.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Immortal Cave wrapped in black had also sensed the crisis. </p><p></p><p>A loud rumbling echoed in the Immortal Cave world, the earth split, and the ocean surged with giant waves...</p><p></p><p>Countless creatures within it involuntarily cried out in agony.</p><p></p><p>But they couldn't affect Li Fan's devouring speed at all.</p><p></p><p>With the constant infusion of blackness, a part of the Five Elements' Grand Immortal Cave began to become transparent and disappear.</p><p></p><p>The struggle of the Immortal Cave grew weaker.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it fell completely silent.</p><p></p><p>Although the Five Elements' Grand Immortal Cave disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The void here still remained.</p><p></p><p>Empty and void.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, a figure suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>It was Li Fan, who had successfully ascended to the Primordial Infant stage.</p><p></p><p>Surging with immense power all over his body, Li Fan had never felt so strong since he began cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary Harmonizing, the power covers the lands of the Yellow Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elements' Grand Immortal Cave I devoured is equivalent to the merging of five provinces."</p><p></p><p>"Quantitative change leads to qualitative change. With absolute strength alone, I can easily crush all weak Harmonizing cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, I have many divine abilities in me."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes sparkled, finally feeling a sense of security.</p><p></p><p>As long as he didn't encounter a Longevity Realm expert, no matter how reckless he behaved in this world, he should be able to escape calmly!</p><p></p><p>"With such a significant expansion of power, planning in the future will be much more convenient." He thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Having successfully ascended, Li Fan did not rush to leave.</p><p></p><p>Instead, his spiritual sense continuously swept through the void here, seemingly searching for something.</p><p></p><p>One time, two times.</p><p></p><p>After several attempts, nothing abnormal was found.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan didn't give up.</p><p></p><p>After his strength greatly increased, he keenly perceived that there seemed to be something else hidden in the Five Elements' void here.</p><p></p><p>Deeply concealed.</p><p></p><p>But when Li Fan successfully broke through and thoroughly devoured the Five Elements' Grand Immortal Cave, due to the drastic change in the environment, a bit of a flaw was revealed.</p><p></p><p>Detected by Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>This hidden presence did not belong to the Yellow Realm's [Roots of the Earth].</p><p></p><p>It was the lingering and ever-present...</p><p></p><p>Du'e Sect!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>A rainbow aura enveloped him, then the rainbow light suddenly brightened countless times in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Expanding into the surrounding vacuum, the rainbow divine light appeared tangible.</p><p></p><p>Completely filling and occupying the empty space.</p><p></p><p>The effects were excellent.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's goal had ultimately been achieved.</p><p></p><p>Under the pure rainbow light, a foreign object finally revealed itself.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes shimmered as he reached out to capture it.</p><p></p><p>Upon careful observation, it was a small figure made of yellow paper.</p><p></p><p>As if existing for too long, the yellow paper doll had faded somewhat.</p><p></p><p>And this little figure was quite peculiar.</p><p></p><p>It had no facial features on its head, only a single eye occupying the entire face.</p><p></p><p>What made Li Fan feel uneasy was that the one-eyed paper doll seemed to be alive.</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan grabbed it, the eye slightly moved, staring fixedly at him.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan felt a hint of heat in his hand, as if being scorched by a blazing fire.</p><p></p><p>"Playing tricks!"</p><p></p><p>A burst of flames appeared in his hand, enveloping the one-eyed paper doll.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan attempted to burn it to ashes.</p><p></p><p>However, despite the flames dancing for a while, the paper doll remained completely unaffected.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it had no physical existence at all; even if Li Fan's flames were scorching hot, they couldn't damage it in the slightest!</p><p></p><p>Next, Li Fan tried various methods.</p><p></p><p>Five Elements spells, Annihilation Sword, and even formations.</p><p></p><p>None of them could destroy it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, a phrase popped into Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Jump out of the Three Realms and not in the Five Elements."</p><p></p><p>The yellow paper doll's eye turned slightly.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 937</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After the Sky Patrolling Arrows broke through the obstruction of the Celestials, they swiftly transformed back into nearly ten thousand silver-white thin arrows in an instant. They flew rapidly towards the various territories of the Five Elders Association.</p><p></p><p>Despite many elders from the Five Elders Association attempting to intervene, the quantity of these Sky Patrolling Arrows was truly overwhelming. Moreover, it must be noted that each Sky Patrolling Arrow possessed nearly the power of a strike at the Grand Dao level. The sudden occurrence made it difficult for even the elders of the Five Elders Association with Grand Dao cultivation to intercept them.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, these ten thousand Sky Patrolling Arrows scattered like fireworks, transforming into countless different trajectories, all landing on the land of the Five Elders Association.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Even through the Sky Mirror, Li Fan could feel the tremendous vibrations coming from a distance.</p><p></p><p>However, the Sky Patrolling Arrows giant net that the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance spared no cost to launch, using the lives of all thirty-three chosen immortals, was not merely about bombarding.</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, from the location where each Sky Patrolling Arrow fell to the ground, numerous silver threads suddenly burst out.</p><p></p><p>Forming a huge cocoon with a narrow top and wide bottom, resembling a strange pair of pliers.</p><p></p><p>Deeply rooted in the depths of the earth.</p><p></p><p>From the top of these cocoons, a very fine silver thread spurted towards the location of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, crossing an immeasurable distance.</p><p></p><p>Nearly ten thousand thin threads converged in the territory of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance!</p><p></p><p>These changes occurred in the blink of an eye, even the five Celestial Elders in the sky had not completely shattered yet.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan watched this scene in the Sky Mirror, and despite his multiple reincarnations, he was unsure of what the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance was planning to do.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, a sense of unease gradually arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of many, it seemed as if a towering giant made a forceful tug on the side of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>A loud rumble resounded again.</p><p></p><p>The giant cocoons deeply embedded in the depths of the Five Elders Association's territory seemed like sturdy ropes, seemingly pulling and distorting something towards the location of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The rumbling continued, as if a significant event was occurring in the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>And the five radiant celestial forms confronting the remaining Celestial Elders seemed to become even more urgent.</p><p></p><p>Strangely, their attacks weakened instead, for reasons unknown.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Elders' divine manifestations, which were on the brink of shattering at any moment, unexpectedly persevered for a while longer.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's sense of unease grew increasingly severe.</p><p></p><p>Upon careful contemplation, it was not about himself but more like an instinct of a living being, akin to how spiritual beings get agitated before a natural disaster strikes.</p><p></p><p>"This is...,"</p><p></p><p>Finally, it seemed like the Five Elders Association reacted.</p><p></p><p>Deploying a large number of cultivators, they launched attacks against those giant cocoons.</p><p></p><p>However, it seemed as if the cocoons did not exist at all, with most of the cultivators' attacks falling flat. Only the foremost cultivators with Grand Dao cultivation seemed to be able to slightly distort the silver threads spewing out from the cocoons.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, the net of light enveloping the entire territory of the Five Elders Association was firm and unyielding, with these minor disturbances having no significant impact.</p><p></p><p>Changes continued to occur resolutely.</p><p></p><p>The radiance representing the five Celestial Elders in the sky grew increasingly dim.</p><p></p><p>As if....</p><p></p><p>The powers of these five Eternal Celestial Elders were subject to some restrictions!</p><p></p><p>A flash of insight suddenly struck Li Fan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Like thunder piercing through the mist, the scene before him changed!</p><p></p><p>The cocoons and interconnected threads were no longer linking to the land of the Five Elders Association but to another massive net!</p><p></p><p>A net representing the principles of the heavens and earth!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan finally understood.</p><p></p><p>Each of the Five Elders of the Five Elders Association had their respective territories.</p><p></p><p>In these regions, their reversal of the principles of the heavens and earth was more solid compared to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Even the weaker ones, once they left these areas, the reversal of the principles of the heavens and earth lost its effect.</p><p></p><p>These places could be considered as the birthplaces of these Celestial Elders.</p><p></p><p>And now, through some method, the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance had caused a distortion in the inherent principles of the heavens and earth in these areas using those cocoons, much like a supporting pillar of a bridge bending.</p><p></p><p>Though the bridge wouldn't collapse immediately, it would sway uncontrollably!</p><p></p><p>In reality, it meant that the powers of the five Celestial Elders were inevitably affected at this moment!</p><p></p><p>Li Fan rose to his feet, astonishment written all over his face.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that such a method could be used in the battle against the Eternal Celestial Elders.</p><p></p><p>"The distortion of the principles of heaven and earth has a time limit. Those five Celestial Elders will certainly try to slowly eliminate this influence. But before that, it's a perfect opportunity for the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>As if echoing Li Fan's speculation, gates suddenly appeared above the Five Elders Association.</p><p></p><p>Countless black-clothed cultivators flew out through the gates.</p><p></p><p>Expressionless, radiating a palpable aura of slaughter.</p><p></p><p>They began sweeping through the various regions of the Five Elders Association.</p><p></p><p>"These Divine Artificers..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan was not unfamiliar with these elite soldiers shaped by the era.</p><p></p><p>Their powerful combat strength remained as formidable as ever.</p><p></p><p>The sudden turn of events, with no clear leadership, left the Five Elders Association unable to organize a proper resistance.</p><p></p><p>Each fought independently, swiftly being defeated by the black-clothed cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The offensive of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance was like heavy dark clouds, irresistible, crushing over the Five Elders Association.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Sky Mirror, the cultivators who had been watching nonchalantly earlier went into frenzy.</p><p></p><p>"What is this? What's happening? Is this the same Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance we know?"</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Alliance has hidden so deeply? Their military strength is truly unimaginably strong!"</p><p></p><p>"I say, is there a possibility... I say just a possibility... that all these scenes are illusions created by the Sky Mirror? After all, we have been in a standoff with them for thousands of years. How could they be defeated so easily? I'm starting to doubt it."</p><p></p><p>"Friend, that's what I think. It seems highly unreasonable. Is there anyone with the guts to go and see it personally at the Five Elders Association? Seeing is believing after all."</p><p></p><p>"Heh, I've long known a secret route that leads to the Five Elders Association. Friends, wait a moment, I'll go and verify it personally."</p><p></p><p>"You traitors! Still talking tough. I really want to see your faces when the Five Elders Association is completely taken over!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Various reactions played out before the Sky Mirror, representing human diversity.</p><p></p><p>However, the battle between the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance and the Five Elders Association continued without regard to their will.</p><p></p><p>The number of black-clothed cultivators seemed endless, continually flying out of the gates.</p><p></p><p>And without the need for commands, they operated in extraordinary harmony.</p><p></p><p>After emerging from the gates, they each went about their tasks with great efficiency.</p><p></p><p>Occupying strategic points, constructing defensive fortifications.</p><p></p><p>Advancing steadily towards the enemy.</p><p></p><p>Instead of exterminating everyone, they sent all the captured Five Elders Association cultivators through the gates.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>The young transmission master looked at the sinister smile on the opposite party's face, feeling both shocked and fearful, unable to help but reprimand. The actions he took, however, betrayed his true thoughts.</p><p></p><p>A black aura enveloped his body, with a dark and eerie transformation slowly consuming him as if the space was being torn apart. </p><p></p><p>"I can feel the fear in your heart."</p><p></p><p>"Why do you want to escape? What are you afraid of?"</p><p></p><p>The Law King of the Mysterious Sky Sect gazed at the young man in front of him, whispering lowly.</p><p></p><p>"Face your own inner self...."</p><p></p><p>"Allow yourself..."</p><p></p><p>"To return to your true self...."</p><p></p><p>The words of the Law King of the Mysterious Sky Sect seemed to contain some strange power. With his low chanting, a transparent dividing line abruptly appeared between him and the young transmission master.</p><p></p><p>On both ends of the dividing line, like worlds inside and outside a mirror, mirrored and perfectly matched, the shadow of the Law King of the Mysterious Sky Sect and the young transmission master instantly overlapped.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, a dark aura identical to the one displayed by the young transmission master even appeared around the Law King of the Mysterious Sky Sect, as if he was truly a mirror image of the young man!</p><p></p><p>Even when the young man saw this scene, his expression became increasingly terrified, mirroring the same look on the Law King of the Mysterious Sky Sect's face!</p><p></p><p>The dividing line between the two of them grew brighter.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the area between them seemed to be cut off. The Law King of the Mysterious Sky Sect and the young transmission master drew closer.</p><p></p><p>"You forced me into this!" A mixture of indescribable fear surged in the young man's heart. He gritted his teeth and spoke with resentment.</p><p></p><p>Following this, a thin golden thread emerged from his brow.</p><p></p><p>This thin thread seemed to possess unique power that the Law King of the Mysterious Sky Sect could not replicate.</p><p></p><p>The mirrored world that was formed did not display the image of the golden thread. Thus, a slight disharmony emerged.</p><p></p><p>Slightly trembling, the mirrored world seemed to be in danger.</p><p></p><p>Even the figure of the Law King of the Mysterious Sky Sect appeared somewhat unstable.</p><p></p><p>"We are originally one entity."</p><p></p><p>"Do you hate yourself so much? Do you need to use such treasures?"</p><p></p><p>"Why go this far?"</p><p></p><p>....</p><p></p><p>At a crucial moment, the murmuring voice of the Law King of the Mysterious Sky Sect once again echoed in the young man's ears.</p><p></p><p>The young man's expression changed from fierce to somewhat confused, finally calming down.</p><p></p><p>And that golden thread somehow retracted back into his brow.</p><p></p><p>The distance between him and the Law King of the Mysterious Sky Sect once again diminished.</p><p></p><p>"Surviving for so long, with no hope ahead. I can feel the hesitation and unwillingness in your heart...."</p><p></p><p>"Upon rediscovering your true self, you will unleash the supreme potential hidden within you. The Great Dao beckons...."</p><p></p><p>With the continuous murmurs of the Law King of the Mysterious Sky Sect, the distance between the young man and him continued to lessen.</p><p></p><p>In the end, there was only a dividing line separating them.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes met, their expressions completely identical.</p><p></p><p>There was no more fear or confusion, only the joy of enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>A burst of intense light erupted from the dividing line.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, it vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The mirrored world then descended into reality!</p><p></p><p>The figures of the young man and the Law King of the Mysterious Sky Sect completely overlapped.</p><p></p><p>Only the young transmission master was left in the field after the fusion was completed.</p><p></p><p>The transformed young transmission master stood quietly in mid-air, seemingly digesting the vast information in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Sovereign of Transmission? Alliance of Ten Thousand Immortals?"</p><p></p><p>"I never expected that even in this era, they still hold reservations against our Mysterious Sky Sect."</p><p></p><p>"The Slaying Mysterious Secret Technique...."</p><p></p><p>"The Young Transmission Master" snorted, "Who knew they'd have the audacity to keep the secret technique unchanged for thousands of years."</p><p></p><p>"Seems they underestimate us too much."</p><p></p><p>With the young man's words, his aura subtly changed.</p><p></p><p>"This should be sufficient to deceive them, as long as I don't employ the sect's secret techniques."</p><p></p><p>The young man nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>However, a hint of puzzlement resurfaced on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Not discovered by chance, but guided here..."</p><p></p><p>"Using the name of our Mysterious Sky Sect to attract followers, even knowing my whereabouts..."</p><p></p><p>"After being exposed, they resort to direct confrontation."</p><p></p><p>"Cloud Mutual Aid Society, Merciful Immortals of the Mortal World?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, based on the information he had, the truth of the matter was revealed.</p><p></p><p>The young man who had been manipulated did not erupt in anger, rather, he recalled the mysterious faceless statue of the Mysterious Sky God that appeared in the intelligence.</p><p></p><p>He slightly pinched his fingers, then his face revealed surprise: "I cannot sense the position?"</p><p></p><p>"But it is indeed the statue of the Mysterious Sky God."</p><p></p><p>The skepticism in the young man's eyes grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be the handiwork of a brother within the sect?</p><p></p><p>"...Their style of action does indeed seem to match that of our Mysterious Sky Sect members."</p><p></p><p>Various faces flashed through the young man's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Realizing the situation is dire, and that it can no longer be handled, they thought to use me to quell this matter?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems this brother may have only recently awakened."</p><p></p><p>Although the young man was initially skeptical of the other's intentions, upon receiving the complete memories of this transmission master, he began to doubt his own judgment.</p><p></p><p>Because he learned that during the catastrophic calamity when the laws were incompatible, some senior cultivators from the Ten Sects of Immortality simultaneously disappeared.</p><p></p><p>And they had not been seen in the Immortal Realm since.</p><p></p><p>"If this is true, it is likely that those traitors are now living freely."</p><p></p><p>A hint of murderous intent flashed in the young man's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Without the power of a true immortal, escaping from the Dark Starry Sea would undoubtedly come at a painful price. It's probably impossible now."</p><p></p><p>"So, my only hope of escape lies with the Mysterious Sky King."</p><p></p><p>The young man was not worried about the possibility of the Mysterious Sky King having escaped on his own.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Sky King cultivated the path of "words and deeds unite", and promises were not made lightly. Once made, they had to be fulfilled. Otherwise, it would mean the destruction of his path, and even if he became a true immortal, there was a risk of falling back into the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Thus, as long as he was alive, he would undoubtedly reassemble the other Law Kings to fulfill the promise made years ago.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the possibility that the faceless statue of the Mysterious Sky God could potentially lead them to the location of the Mysterious Sky King.</p><p></p><p>The face of the young man flashed with this sudden realization.</p><p></p><p>The statue of the Mysterious Sky God was not modeled after the image of the Mysterious Sky King but based on a true immortal whom the Mysterious Sky King encountered in the ascension channel.</p><p></p><p>According to the Mysterious Sky King, the aura emitted by that true immortal was vast as the mountains and seas.</p><p></p><p>Compared to this newly ascended immortal, he was as small as an ant.</p><p></p><p>At that time, as he cracked open the void and entered the ascension channel, he heard terrifying roars in the distance.</p><p></p><p>He saw an unforgettable scene.</p><p></p><p>Countless figures were frantically trying to escape but were engulfed by the terrifying black ruins.</p><p></p><p>An endless number of bodies fell from the cracks in the ascension channel.</p><p></p><p>There must have been a horrific disaster in the Immortal Realm!</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Sky King turned and ran, collecting the corpses of the immortal cultivators he encountered along the way.</p><p></p><p>However, the speed at which the ascension channel was collapsing seemed to exceed what he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>He was about to fall into the abyss like the other ascendants.</p><p></p><p>A figure passed by him, extending a helping hand and pulling him out of the collapsing space channel.</p><p></p><p>After calming down, the Mysterious Sky King realized the significance of the rescue from the faceless true immortal.</p><p></p><p>The faceless true immortal undoubtedly held a high cultivation level among the immortals.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't get a clear look at the face of the figure.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry and escape, or it will be too late."</p><p></p><p>The faceless true immortal shook his head and disappeared without a trace, leaving the Mysterious Sky King in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>It was only later that the Mysterious Sky King realized the meaning of the word "escape."</p><p></p><p>The ascension channel had collapsed, and the path to immortality was severed.</p><p></p><p>What remained was the existence known as the Immortal Relics.</p><p></p><p>And the influence of the Immortal Relics on the mortal realm had just begun to emerge.</p>

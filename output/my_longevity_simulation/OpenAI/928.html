        <h1>Chapter 928</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Du brothers are estimated not to be the choice of famous generals, and the wars in Xinxing and Nanyang counties ended very quickly. Not long after Leng Hubao led his troops away, Zhao Jingzhi, who went out with the army, returned with a quick horse and reported victory.</p><p></p><p>The elite cavalry of Jingzhou arrived first on the north bank of the Han River opposite the Xinxing county city, causing the defenders in the city to be alert, and urgently withdrawing troops from nearby garrisons to assist in defending the city.</p><p></p><p>When the troops carrying supplies from Xiangyang arrived, their garrison was also not on guard, but instead considered them as reinforcements, let them into the city with the intention of cooperating in defense, but the result was naturally the city being breached and casualties.</p><p></p><p>After the troops from Xiangyang captured the city of Xinxing, they immediately ferried the troops from Jingzhou south with boats and ships, and after the two sides converged, they attacked the city of Nanyang upstream, and the city was captured shortly after the battle began.</p><p></p><p>By the time Zhao Jingzhi returned to report victory, the situation in the two counties was basically stabilized, just waiting for a few more days for thorough clearing before the expedition troops could return triumphantly.</p><p></p><p>Due to this sudden attack and the rapid end of the battles, many personalities in the two cities were preserved, and not many were separated due to the chaos of war.</p><p></p><p>According to the household registration books found in the two counties' yamen, the population in these two counties was about three thousand households. Even if some were scattered, the final number of people collected would definitely exceed the registered population. Because the population sheltered by the southern Liang nobles was relatively small compared to the north, many noble families and their followers were not listed.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning of this news, Li Tai couldn't help but smile. Currently, his Jingzhou was in need of a population the most!</p><p></p><p>Although he had lost in wealth against Emperor Xiao, Li Tai was not destitute. The resources he could command were far beyond what Emperor Xiao could compare to, especially in recent years with production bases and commercial networks he had been operating in various places like Guanzhong, northern Shaanxi, and Longyou. Each of these resources was worth far more than the riches gathered by Emperor Xiao. </p><p></p><p>Even though the Nanyang Basin was currently in a downturn, its natural resources and geographical location had not disappeared, still holding immense potential value. To quickly tap into this value, there was a need for people.</p><p></p><p>As the end of the year approached, some smaller-scale water conservancy projects had been completed, awaiting inspection following the spring flood season next year. At that time, there would be large tracts of unclaimed wasteland emerging, and the sooner it was opened up, the faster profits could be made.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Tai had a series of policies aimed at the local powerful families and their followers to be implemented, the interim effects were still unknown, and he naturally hoped for a definite increase in population.</p><p></p><p>With the downsizing of county officials, local administrative capacity was gradually improving, and Li Tai even considered enrolling the barbarians into households for land allocation.</p><p></p><p>However, it was not a matter of racial discrimination, as the barbarians' suitability for household registration was very limited due to their lack of agricultural and weaving skills, strong dependence on their leaders, and nomadic nature. If they were enrolled as households, they would need to shoulder corresponding rents, taxes, and corvee labor, and adhere to set conditions to be considered qualified land allottees.</p><p></p><p>Barbarian communities often required several generations of settlement and adaptation to the plains area before they met the conditions for household registration. Even if they were enrolled to show short-term political achievements, they could easily disperse in the face of disasters and calamities.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the barbarians were mainly recruited collectively for conscription and labor, and their individual value was not high, mainly used as slaves, unable to assume more complex social divisions and production roles.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in a stable social environment over a long period, with abundant production and living resources in the region, as well as the guidance of complementary government policies, the barbarians' assimilation period could be greatly shortened, quickly making them no different from the Han people.</p><p></p><p>However, in the governance of Jingzhou under Li Tai, there was not yet a solid foundation for large-scale recruitment and assimilation of barbarians, not only in terms of livelihood but also in other aspects.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he felt that the more reliable way to increase the population directly under the jurisdiction of the state and county government was to obtain them from the south through warfare capture and policy incentives, although the latter required a longer period, it was not impossible. Many of the people between the Jiang and Han rivers had fled from the northern regions, and they might still have memories of their hometown.</p><p></p><p>Although the South Liang territory had long been free of large-scale military disasters and was socially stable and prosperous, this was for the upper class. But in fact, internal contradictions were likely sharper than those of the Southern Dynasties of Song and Qi, as the upper class constantly maneuvered and changed, resulting in a heavier social burden with declining wealth distribution. By using various financial means such as minting coins and levying taxes, as well as the growing power of the clergy groups, the South Liang government had started to oppress the populace financially.</p><p></p><p>The fact that Hou Jing could muster support within South Liang was likely due to the sharp internal contradictions that had reached a peak. Many middle and lower-class soldiers and civilians would rather follow a wolfish ambitious leader like Hou Jing than continue to be bled dry by the Xiao family.</p><p></p><p>Li Tai, as a military official who rose with the rise of the local militia system, might not be regarded as a truly progressive class, but as a transmigrator, he was always inclined towards progressive ideas.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, for the people captured from Southern Dynasties, he did not follow the usual practice of using them as soldiers, slaves, or laborers, but rather treated them as civilians and directly enrolled them into households.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in the minds of these Southern Dynasty soldiers and civilians, the Western Wei regime was seen as barbaric and backward. The formation and transformation of ideas could not be achieved overnight, but it was necessary. The stories of the kings and nobles of the Northern and Southern Dynasties might fluctuate, but innocent people were always the ones who suffered the most.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after Zhao Jing returned, Leng Hubao and others also escorted the prisoners of the two counties back. Li Tai had long arranged for the local officials to prepare for the enrollment of these prisoners, treating them kindly, but not without purpose.</p><p></p><p>Although the common people were innocent, they also tended to be complaisant; at least they needed to know that this kindness was not easily given, and then they would cherish the life they gained.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, during the enrollment of these prisoners, they had to reveal their miserable lives under Southern Liang and accuse the officials who had mistreated them by name. This seemingly simple step was actually about breaking down their old authority. If they felt that life under Southern Liang was not bad, then there was no need to enroll them into households and hand out land; they could continue to enjoy life here with patience.</p><p></p><p>The registered household would be divided into villages and neighborhoods, with personnel selected from the previous batch of soldiers and civilians from Fancheng appointed as village and neighborhood leaders, responsible for quickly stabilizing these newly enrolled households and preparing for land distribution. The investigation based on their accusations would continue, with neighborhood meetings held every five days and village meetings every ten days. Only after attending a sufficient number of meetings would they be granted land and issued farm tools, seeds, and the like.</p><p></p><p>Li Tai also dispatched local officials to participate in these neighborhood and village meetings to record the tales of mismanagement under Southern Liang told by the registered people. After the land distribution was completed, and the boundaries of villages and neighborhoods were defined, these stories would be recounted in the villages, allowing all villagers to deeply sense the darkness of Southern Liang's politics and the misery of life. Compared to the current stable and prosperous life, they would naturally appreciate the good life created by General Li!</p><p></p><p>While rural development and ideological transformation were busy and lively in Jingzhou, things were relatively calm in Xiangyang.</p><p></p><p>After the end of the battles in the two cities, the Xiangyang side escorted the troops from Jingzhou out of the territory. Li Tai expected Emperor Xiao to send envoys soon to discuss the next steps, but there was no news from Xiangyang until the New Year arrived, leaving him puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Similarly puzzling to Li Tai was the Northern Expedition of Southern Liang in Huabei. According to historical time calculations, there should have been results by now. He had previously sent envoys to inquire with Wang Sizheng but received vague responses, indicating the two sides were still at a standstill.</p><p></p><p>Despite being resourceful, Li Tai was not omniscient. In places where he couldn't see, important matters were unfolding.</p><p></p><p>In the distant capital city of Jiankang along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, on a mild winter day, although slightly chill, not unbearable, Crown Prince Xiao Gang invited the scholars of the Wen De Institute to a feast in the East Palace's Xuanyou Hall.</p><p></p><p>The crowd in the hall was already in high spirits, expressing a variety of literary works, songs, and scholarly debates. Literature and philosophy were the prominent studies of the Southern Dynasties, and the Crown Prince, being a grandmaster in these fields, enjoyed the atmosphere of scholarly discussions in the hall, tolerant even if the scholars were slightly disrespectful.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an elderly man strode into the hall, causing a sudden chill in the atmosphere. Even those who were being boisterous and pretending to be carefree sat up straight, no longer daring to act impudently.</p><p></p><p>The elderly man was named Liu Jin, holding the position of the Grand Preceptor of the Crown Prince, and even the Crown Prince treated him with great respect, not daring to show any disrespect.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Crown Prince was about to have his servants set up a seat for Liu Jin, the latter performed a greeting and said, "There is urgent news from Jiangling, requesting Your Highness to move to another hall."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Crown Prince did not dare to delay and went to the other hall to receive a letter from Prince Dong sent from Jiangling, stating that Prince Yueyang, Xiao Cha, had abused power and was suspected of killing the prominent Du family in the region. Prince Dong earnestly requested the Crown Prince's support to lead troops to Xiangyang to investigate thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>After reading the letter, the Crown Prince's face changed abruptly, and he angrily exclaimed, "Since the matter is so heinous, I should report it to the Royal Council! If the seven officials report this to me indiscriminately, how am I supposed to respond?"</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Upon hearing Hundred Flowers Daoist's words, Li Fan couldn't help but feel a tremor in his heart. </p><p></p><p>The originally silent faceless immortal stone statue seemed to move in an instant. </p><p></p><p>Looking at Li Fan with her slightly mocking and dark eyes... </p><p></p><p>However, when Li Fan looked again, all the unusual phenomenon had disappeared in an instant. </p><p></p><p>Returning to its ordinary stone appearance. </p><p></p><p>The information revealed by Hundred Flowers Daoist was indeed too terrifying. It made Li Fan, astonished and alarmed, want to reveal his true identity on the spot! </p><p></p><p>However, the present Grand Teacher Li was no longer the small foundation-building cultivator who had been forced into a corner by the Heavenly Physician and had to reveal his true self! </p><p></p><p>If one were to be frightened into revealing their true self by a single statement of unknown veracity, that would truly be a joke! </p><p></p><p>Li Fan narrowed his eyes, and quickly flashed through the images of his experiences in this world in his mind. </p><p></p><p>Then he felt a bit more reassured. </p><p></p><p>The faceless immortal stone statue was related to the faceless immortal who once saved the King of Mystery, and the stone statue even contained a part of the power of a true immortal, a fact that Li Fan had confirmed in his mind when he saw the devotees praying before it, able to elevate cultivation levels and draw in golden wish power from thin air... </p><p></p><p>If it were merely the effect of the stone statue without the power of that faceless immortal sustaining it, it would be somewhat incomprehensible. </p><p></p><p>However, at that time, Li Fan was still optimistic. </p><p></p><p>He didn't have the courage to face a true immortal directly, but he did have the courage to take advantage of the remnants of a true immortal's power. </p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I have underestimated the power of true immortals. Where their power reaches, it is as if they are personally present..." </p><p></p><p>Or perhaps Li Fan had fallen into a thinking error, trying to gauge the abilities of true immortals from the perspective of an ordinary cultivator. </p><p></p><p>In Li Fan's original view, this true immortal stone statue was equivalent to a formation that could enhance the sensitivity of the killing machine without features, allowing the true immortal to sense many things happening around the statue at any time. </p><p></p><p>Now the conclusion was overturned. </p><p></p><p>This stone statue was equivalent to the personal arrival of a true immortal! </p><p></p><p>Thinking up to this point, despite Li Fan's firm and extraordinary will, he couldn't help but feel an intangible sense of weight. </p><p></p><p>After all, deceiving above and below, and being reckless under everyone's noses, were completely different concepts. </p><p></p><p>But after some contemplation, Li Fan still withstood this pressure and did not immediately reveal his true self. </p><p></p><p>There were three reasons for this. </p><p></p><p>Firstly, even if the stone statue represents the presence of a true immortal, since Li Fan unearthed the stone statue until now, he had never exposed the secret of his possession of the "true self". In the eyes of the true immortal, he was just a slightly stronger Yuan Ying cultivator, exploiting the name of the compassionate immortal of the mundane world for his own benefit. Even in the realm of longevity, he might not necessarily fall under the gaze of a true immortal. Moreover, who would be curious about why a flying ant in an anthill looked stronger than the others? If that faceless immortal could truly sense everything happening here, and Li Fan was still living well, it was the best proof that he hadn't caught the true immortal's attention yet. </p><p></p><p>Secondly, the faceless stone statue had appeared in the realm of Xuanhuang before. During the rule of Xuantian Sect, the statues were almost everywhere in the realm of Xuanhuang. However, with the rebellion of the ten major immortal sects and the downfall of Xuantian Sect, countless stone statues were damaged, leaving only the last one collected by Mr. Bai. In this process, the faceless immortal remained indifferent, showing no sign of his power or punishment. This indicated that he was actually indifferent to the affairs of the Xuanhuang realm and perhaps only those who displayed powers on the level of immortals deserved the attention of true immortals. So, despite the commotion caused by Li Fan, it was actually irrelevant to the true immortals. </p><p></p><p>The last point, and the primary reason Li Fan ultimately decided not to reveal his true self yet and continue observing, was the existence of the Immortal Cultivator and the "Tall Wall". </p><p></p><p>The Immortal Cultivator, sitting in meditation in the Immortal Land, had been enlightening for nearly ten thousand years. </p><p></p><p>During the 115th generation, Li Fan had used the Medicine King Cauldron to cause a disruption in the Immortal Cultivator's enlightenment process, forcing him to open his eyes. </p><p></p><p>If there was an existence of equivalent power not far from the Immortal Land in the realm of Xuanhuang, how could the Immortal Cultivator peacefully cultivate for such a long time? </p><p></p><p>At the bedside where others rested, how could he allow another to sleep peacefully? Li Fan didn't believe that reaching the level of immortality meant exemption from such principles! </p><p></p><p>Then there was the "Tall Wall". </p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether the Tall Wall was built by the Immortal Cultivator or built outside, its function of filtering and blocking the level of immortals had already been confirmed. </p><p></p><p>Existing inside or outside the Tall Wall would undoubtedly be affected to some extent. It wouldn't likely be as if the true immortal was personally present. </p><p></p><p>"If that faceless true immortal detects anything amiss and crosses the Tall Wall..." </p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid it would immediately alert the Immortal Cultivator of the Immortal Land." </p><p></p><p>"When two tigers meet, there will surely be a battle. But I have enough time to reveal my true self." </p><p></p><p>In an instant, after weighing the options, Li Fan had made a decision. </p><p></p><p>"It seems very dangerous on the surface, but because the power difference between the two parties is so great, it might not be as dire as imagined." </p><p></p><p>"As long as the 'true self' is not revealed." </p><p></p><p>"On the other hand, if it weren't for me possessing the 'true self', I wouldn't have thought that there could really be a treasure that could transform reality into fiction and reverse everything." </p><p></p><p>... </p><p></p><p>As his thoughts gradually condensed, Li Fan looked at the frightened Hundred Flowers Daoist in front of him and smiled slightly, "Daoist Hundred Flowers only knows half of the truth." </p><p></p><p>"Regarding mundane matters, in most cases, would true immortals even be interested in them?" </p><p></p><p>"These various matters in the realm of Xuanhuang have me to relieve the true immortals' worries." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan said calmly, seemingly for confirmation, as the golden wish power-filled disaster body slowly flew out of his body. </p><p></p><p>As soon as the golden disaster body appeared, the body of Hundred Flowers Daoist seemed to be like a lake being swept by a hurricane, violently swaying. </p><p></p><p>From her, Li Fan sensed emotions like "fear," "greed," and "dread." </p><p></p><p>"Indeed..." </p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought so in his mind and slowly controlled the tiny bit of golden wish power within the disaster body, injecting it into the body of Hundred Flowers Daoist. </p><p></p><p>As the golden wish power entered her body, Hundred Flowers Daoist couldn't suppress a groan. </p><p></p><p>On her previously unclear face, a stunningly beautiful face suddenly emerged, like the sun breaking through the clouds. </p><p></p><p>However, the former elegance had disappeared, her eyes were dazed, gazing at the fingertip of the golden disaster body touching her forehead. </p><p></p><p>A sense of begging and longing gushed forth. </p><p></p><p>This scene was beyond words. </p><p></p><p>Even Li Fan's emotions were stirred up slightly. </p><p></p><p>He seemed to see a peerless magnolia, surpassing all other flowers in the world, blooming slowly in front of him, radiating its beauty. </p><p></p><p>"Hmph." </p><p></p><p>Facing the pleading of Hundred Flowers Daoist, Li Fan strengthened his mental resolve in an instant and withdrew the golden disaster body. </p><p></p><p>The countless empty and resentful eyes of Hundred Flowers Daoist were coldly glanced at by Li Fan as a warning.</p>

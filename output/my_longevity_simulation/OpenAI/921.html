            <p>He didn't feel any of the dangers described in other cultivation classics, everything just fell into place seamlessly.</p><p></p><p>In just half a day, he successfully stepped into the Golden Core realm.</p><p></p><p>"A pure Yin body..."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing deeply inhaled, sensing the earth-shaking changes happening within his body.</p><p></p><p>The Yang energy was completely transformed, the final obstacle disappeared, and Li Qing felt that his new body had reached a state of perfection and harmony.</p><p></p><p>The speed of spiritual energy circulation nearly doubled, and even his understanding of cultivation methods and occult techniques had improved by a notch compared to the past.</p><p></p><p>A rebirth!</p><p></p><p>And his Golden Core also looked different from the common appearances recorded in the classics. It resembled the moon in the middle of the sky, emitting a cold white light. The core was full of mysterious Dao patterns, highlighting the extraordinary nature of this Golden Core.</p><p></p><p>All the changes made Li Qing extremely delighted.</p><p></p><p>"In terms of innate talent for cultivation, even Zhao Ruoxi is far inferior to me now."</p><p></p><p>"And my Golden Core's quality is exceptional."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, all of this cannot be revealed now. It must remain hidden."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing was well aware that if the changes happening to him were noticed by others, it would reveal the true miraculous effects of the "Inverse Law Scripture". It would definitely lead to unimaginable madness!</p><p></p><p>At that time, even the Nascent Soul and Grandmaster disciples of the inner sect would come to snatch it!</p><p></p><p>Compared to attaining the Dao and becoming an immortal, the trivial matter of gender reversal was not worth mentioning!</p><p></p><p>"Until I have enough strength to protect myself, I still need to conceal it.新69书吧→69shuX.com"</p><p></p><p>He put on his clothes again, and the aura belonging to a strong Golden Core practitioner on Li Qing gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>No one would have expected that this outer sect disciple who had suffered heavy injuries just a year ago had already stepped into the realm of cultivation and entered the path of cultivation!</p><p></p><p>Returning to the outer sect to lurk again, Li Qing soon encountered an unexpected dilemma.</p><p></p><p>It was challenging for him to absorb Yin energy for his cultivation from the female practitioners in the outer sect.</p><p></p><p>After careful consideration, Li Qing decided to reveal some of his cultivation and enter the inner sect of the Daoist sect.</p><p></p><p>After a careful selection process, he also chose his target to be his master.</p><p></p><p>Similar to Senior Sister Zhao, a member of the Moonlight lineage, the immortal Huo Jingtong!</p><p></p><p>In fact, with Li Qing's current demonstrated talent, under normal circumstances, he would not have been noticed by Huo Jingtong.</p><p></p><p>But Li Qing had already inquired and confirmed that Huo Jingtong was someone deeply fond of appearance.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing believed that with his increasingly beautiful appearance and the irresistible charm that naturally emanated from him, it wouldn't be difficult to be accepted by Huo Jingtong!</p><p></p><p>The main reason for choosing Huo Jingtong as his target was that this woman had excellent talent, entered the realm of Nascent Soul at a young age without even a hundred years of cultivation.新69书吧→69shuX.com</p><p></p><p>Moreover, she was devoted to cultivation and rarely interacted with male practitioners since she began cultivating, still a virgin to this day.</p><p></p><p>All her disciples were young female practitioners.</p><p></p><p>As a place where Li Qing could secretly grow, it was simply perfect for him!</p><p></p><p>Danger flashed in Li Qing's eyes as he began his secret plot.</p><p></p><p>For outer sect disciples to join the inner sect and become immortal disciples, it naturally required a series of actions.</p><p></p><p>Like a patient hunter, Li Qing waited for the right moment for over three months.</p><p></p><p>One day, the youngest disciple under Huo Jingtong, Sima Jing, received a task to go to the Yin Wind Valley thousands of miles away to pick Soul Yin Pearls for the sect's trial mission.</p><p></p><p>Before Sima Jing set out, Li Qing found her through his acquaintance with another female practitioner from the outer sect.</p><p></p><p>Expressing his pitiful plight, Li Qing begged Sima Jing to take him along.</p><p></p><p>"The Yin Wind Valley is a place of extreme Yin. Perhaps I can absorb enough Yin energy there to completely shed my male appearance," Li Qing reasoned.</p><p></p><p>Initially, Sima Jing hesitated a bit, but seeing Li Qing on the verge of tears, she eventually softened and agreed to take him along.</p><p></p><p>Sima Jing was in her twenties, already in the late Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>However, her experience was shallow, and on the way to Yin Wind Valley, she was quickly enticed by Li Qing's sweet words.</p><p></p><p>Their relationship quickly intensified as Sima Jing saw Li Qing as a confidant, often lamenting the unfortunate events that happened to him.</p><p></p><p>"Qingqing, don't worry. I'll find you more Soul Yin Pearls in the Yin Wind Valley," Sima Jing assured Li Qing, patting her chest.</p><p></p><p>Gratefully, Li Qing held onto Sima Jing's tender hands, refusing to let go.</p><p></p><p>Blushing slightly, Sima Jing did not resist.</p><p></p><p>However, the naive young girl did not know that Li Qing had already revealed her trip to the Yin Wind Valley to another male practitioner from the Daoist sect who had long coveted Sima Jing, Wei Lu.</p><p></p><p>Just like Qin Shou, Wei Lu was a lustful person. Repeatedly rejected by Sima Jing's rejections, he harbored resentment.</p><p></p><p>Receiving the news that Sima Jing was going out alone this time, Wei Lu was already eager to act. Egged on by those around him, he finally made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>While plotting in secret, Wei Lu had no idea that he was also a part of Li Qing's plot.</p><p></p><p>Similar to Li Qing's scheme, at the most critical moment of picking Soul Pearls in the Yin Wind Valley, a group of unexpected intruders suddenly rushed in.</p><p></p><p>Though Sima Jing had considerable strength and various treasures to defend herself, outnumbered and needing to take care of the physically weak Li Qing, she gradually became exhausted and fell into a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that she was on the brink of defeat, Li Qing suddenly made a resolute decision, "Er, don't mind me! Run quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, not wanting to be a burden, Li Qing bravely attracted the attention of the attackers using words, continuously provoking them to focus their attacks on him.</p><p></p><p>While the pressure on Sima Jing lessened, the difference in strength between Li Qing and the bandits was too great. In just a short moment, he was severely injured.</p><p></p><p>This was even without the attackers going all out, following Wei Lu's instructions.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Qing on the verge of death, Sima Jing's eyes teared up in despair.</p><p></p><p>Before Wei Lu could intervene, Sima Jing, using a secret technique that consumed her life force, briefly unleashed the strength of the Golden Core realm. She temporarily forced the group to retreat, then took Li Qing and fled deep into the Yin Wind Valley.</p><p></p><p>With a grim expression, Wei Lu ordered his men to chase immediately.</p><p></p><p>Facing death, Li Qing, seeing Sima Jing sobbing for him, mentioned a secret technique he possessed that could not only heal his injuries but possibly take him a step further.</p><p></p><p>However, this technique was quite unique and required Sima Jing's cooperation.</p><p></p><p>If Sima Jing refused, he would not insist.</p><p></p><p>Blinded by love and extremely naive, Sima Jing readily accepted.</p><p></p><p>After an intimate and fulfilling use of the secret technique that was inappropriate for outsiders to see, it ended.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>What Li Fan saw in the Meteorite Realm Heaven Sword Sect was no different.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like the passage of time had lost its effect on him.</p><p></p><p>Millenniums remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the scene before him, Li Fan even had a kind of illusion that what he saw in the Meteorite Realm was this wooden sword.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what method Shuo Feng used to take away this wooden sword."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan now also noticed some clues.</p><p></p><p>There were millions of broken swords here, with the sword as the core, faintly forming an array.</p><p></p><p>To forcefully take away this wonder of the heavens, not only would one have to face the resistance of the sword.</p><p></p><p>But also be attacked by all the swords in this place.</p><p></p><p>Even if Li Fan could barely achieve it with his current cultivation, it would definitely cause a great commotion and attract the attention of the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"It still has to be willing to follow along, that's the right way."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan tried to convey his intentions, but the wooden sword completely ignored him.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Li Fan didn't really want to take it away.</p><p></p><p>Taking out an Enlightenment Pill and taking it, Li Fan sat on the ground, feeling the sword intent on the wooden sword.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Fan's position was among all the broken swords in the sword mound, closest to the wooden sword.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the faint hostility emanating from these swords, Li Fan just seriously pondered.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the Enlightenment Pill, coupled with Li Fan's decent understanding and the time he had previously spent pondering in the Meteorite Realm, numerous images kept appearing in his mind in a flash.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that this wooden sword itself has undergone some changes over thousands of years."</p><p></p><p>"Compared to what I saw in the Meteorite Realm, it's even more..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan thought for a while but couldn't find a suitable word to describe it.</p><p></p><p>To put it perfectly, the 'sword' that Mister Bai casually formed was the manifestation of the profound Huang Realm Sword Dao, flawless and perfect.</p><p></p><p>To say it was stronger, the two were only different in nature. The wooden sword from thousands of years ago might not necessarily be weaker than the one currently present.</p><p></p><p>"It should be said that, with the changes in the laws of the Profound Huang Realm, this wonder of the heavens is also undergoing changes accordingly."</p><p></p><p>"Well, in general, this sword before me, is more capable of unleashing greater power in today's Profound Huang Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan seemed to have gained some insights.</p><p></p><p>While Li Fan was diligently contemplating the true meaning of the Profound Huang Sword Dao in the sword mound, attempting to replicate Mister Bai's extraordinary feat of creating the wonder of the heavens barehanded,</p><p></p><p>Concealed Cloud Sea, Sea Pavilion Island.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator named Yan Longjiang quietly sought out Jun Shaoli, his fellow senior member.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the other person hesitating to speak, Jun Shaoli smiled, "Friend Yan, just say what you have to say. You are also one of our senior members of the Concealed Cloud Sea. The current scale of our cooperation association is thanks to your dedicated promotion efforts."</p><p></p><p>Yan Longjiang then nervously lowered his voice, "When we six first joined the association, Senior Jun promised to provide each of us with the immortal cave necessary for advancing to the Nascent Soul stage..."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if that promise still stands..."</p><p></p><p>Yan Longjiang swallowed nervously, his face full of tension.</p><p></p><p>It was understandable for him to act in such a manner as the current cooperative association was different from before. In just a few years, it had already developed into a complex network with many members moving on to obtain promising positions within the Immortal Union.</p><p></p><p>And Jun Shaoli himself was mysterious and unpredictable, even the united cultivators were respectful in his presence.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't agree, Yan Longjiang wouldn't dare to show a hint of dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Yan Longjiang didn't expect Jun Shaoli to be more accommodating than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Yan friend, what are you saying? I, Jun, always keep my word. But offering only a mere immortal cave to those who have meritorious service in the association, I wouldn't be reluctant to do so, would I?" Jun Shaoli patted Yan Longjiang's shoulder, reassuring him.</p><p></p><p>He then asked, "Friend Yan, what cultivation method do you practice, and what kind of immortal cave do you seek?"</p><p></p><p>In fact, Jun Shaoli had long understood the situation of the other party, but he still inquired in this manner.</p><p></p><p>Yan Longjiang was delighted at the question and quickly replied, "I practice the 'Seven Demons' Wind Command technique,' as for the immortal cave...I dare not ask for much, just slightly spacious."</p><p></p><p>Yan Longjiang said softly.</p><p></p><p>Jun Shaoli nodded slightly, and after a moment, a suitable target appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Without further ado, Jun Shaoli then quietly led Yan Longjiang to the destination.</p><p></p><p>In the Gathered Tide Isle, Jun Shaoli acted as his protector.</p><p></p><p>However, within seven days, Yan Longjiang successfully absorbed this 'Raging Wind Immortal Cave'.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for fulfilling my wish."</p><p></p><p>"This favor cannot be repaid. In the future, I will do my utmost for the association!"</p><p></p><p>Jun Shaoli waved his hand, "There are too many people here, let's discuss it after we return."</p><p></p><p>Not long after the two left.</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged cultivator in a green robe strolled leisurely towards the Raging Wind Immortal Cave.</p><p></p><p>After checking around to ensure there was no one nearby, he prepared to enter the immortal cave.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, there was no response at all.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged cultivator's face changed drastically; he repeated the process of entering the cave in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>But the result was still the same.</p><p></p><p>Now he was completely flustered.</p><p></p><p>He took out a spiritual talisman and sent a message.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, a burly figure in black robes, with his face concealed, arrived at the scene.</p><p></p><p>Upon inspecting the area, the black-robed cultivator's expression turned extremely grim.</p><p></p><p>"This Raging Wind Immortal Cave has been stolen!"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged cultivator in the green robe looked incredulous, "What? The immortal cave is gone?"</p><p></p><p>He stared ahead blankly, "Who would be so audacious!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed cultivator's eyes revealed an unstoppable killing intent, "Haha, it has always been our Xiang family who takes things from others. Now, someone has dared to mess with us!"</p><p></p><p>"Investigate! Let's see who is so presumptuous!"</p><p></p><p>The Xiang family's response was swift.</p><p></p><p>In just half a cup of tea's time, five or six cultivators arrived at the scene.</p><p></p><p>After casting a spell, they saw two vague figures.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the other party is also not an easy foe. They used a secret method to conceal themselves, so this is the best we could do for now."</p><p></p><p>Among the investigators, the white-haired man leading them sounded a bit regretful.</p><p></p><p>"Can we track the trail?"</p><p></p><p>"It hasn't been long; we should be able to." The white-haired man nodded.</p><p></p><p>With that, he took out a golden square compass and tossed it into the air.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, two faint silver trails appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>"Look, this direction leads to the Gathering Tide Heavenly City."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, it's actually someone from within the Ten Thousand Immortal Alliance?" Xiang family's black-robed cultivator sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid it's cultivators from other regions, not our local ones from Gathered Tide. But it's unclear how the information about the Raging Wind Immortal Cave here leaked." The white-haired man sounded puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, have you heard of something recently?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"A while back, there was a mysterious outbreak of the Immortal and Mortal Plague, and after it settled, the alliance sent people to investigate the underground of the Flag Peak Province. They found traces of the activity of the soul of heaven and earth there. However, it suddenly disappeared." The white-haired man transmitted his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"What does that mean?" The black-robed cultivator squinted his eyes.</p>

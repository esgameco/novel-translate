        <div class="content">
            <p>This kind of unbelievable thing...</p><p></p><p>Doesn't seem like something she could have made up.</p><p></p><p>In her mind, she imagined the scene of the senior being "fished" away, and with Li Fan's current mindset, he couldn't help but feel a sense of horror.</p><p></p><p>When you gaze into the abyss, the abyss is also gazing back at you.</p><p></p><p>When you are fishing, how do you know if you might be the one being fished?</p><p></p><p>"The water of this precious fishing pond, which can connect inside and outside the high wall, is indeed too deep." Li Fan pondered for a moment and decided that he couldn't just rely on Lin Ling's words alone. He had to go there personally to see for himself.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Li Fan concealed his tracks and quickly headed towards Yongyun State.</p><p></p><p>Upon reaching the small temple, whether it was Zhong Shentong, Liu Li, or Lin Ling, it was evident that they had not yet recovered from the sudden disappearance of the senior.</p><p></p><p>They looked panicked and uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you're here." Seeing Li Fan's arrival, Lin Ling seemed to have found her backbone and hurriedly welcomed him.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Shentong also slightly shook, offering a greeting.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan just nodded slightly, then went briskly to where the fishing pond used to be.</p><p></p><p>The once calm pool of water now was completely empty, like a pitch-black abyss after being killed by ink, devoid of any life.</p><p></p><p>Even space itself seemed to be nonexistent.</p><p></p><p>The emanating sense of danger made Li Fan furrow his brows slightly and take a step back.</p><p></p><p>"The fishing pond is really overbearing, a self-contained entity. After occupying a part of the Xuanyellow Realm, it has expelled or directly squeezed out and destroyed all other rules in this place."</p><p></p><p>"With the disappearance of the fishing pond, the occupied area is now revealed. It may take tens of years for the Xuanyellow Realm to restore to normal."</p><p></p><p>As Li Fan contemplated, he identified possible residual traces in this place.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Li Fan hadn't expected much, but what surprised him was that he actually found something.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan's eyes flashed, showing a disappointed expression as if he had found nothing.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, citing the danger of this place, he brought Lin Ling and the others back to the Spirit Wood Realm.</p><p></p><p>After settling them properly, Li Fan quietly returned alone.</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes and concentrating, he recalled the sensation of being merged with the Sea Pearl, similar to the state of viewing the world from a perspective without dimensionality while under no influence of animosity.</p><p></p><p>Dots of light appeared in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Colorful scenes presented themselves in Li Fan's vision.</p><p></p><p>Outside the void left by the fishing pond, countless interwoven, almost imperceptible thin lines were densely distributed.</p><p></p><p>The number of these lines was increasing to a noticeable degree constantly.</p><p></p><p>It was as if there was an invisible loom weaving something in the void.</p><p></p><p>This scene was similar to what Li Fan had once witnessed in the Root of Heaven, a scene during the creation of the Five Elements Cave.</p><p></p><p>This was the world creating in its own way.</p><p></p><p>And the creation at the moment...</p><p></p><p>"The Creation Stone Tablet." Li Fan suddenly opened his eyes, a look of amazement in them.</p><p></p><p>This already showed some resemblance to the Creation Stone Tablet that had been said to record everything in the Xuanyellow Realm since its creation, just like the one the senior had been carrying on his back!</p><p></p><p>As his heart trembled, Li Fan quickly deduced the reason for the appearance of the Creation Stone Tablet here.</p><p></p><p>The Creation Stone Tablet was the embodiment of the laws of the Xuanyellow Realm, essentially the Xuanyellow Realm itself.</p><p></p><p>The world itself could not be taken away by an unknown entity from the depths of the fishing pond.</p><p></p><p>So, even though the senior disappeared, the Creation Stone Tablet he carried was preserved due to the inertia of the world.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the senior has finally fulfilled his wish and gained freedom."</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know what kind of scene is on the other side of the fishing pond."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about possible scenes beyond the high wall, Li Fan was momentarily puzzled.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he shook his head, focusing his attention on the increasingly clear Creation Stone Tablet.</p><p></p><p>This stone tablet was undoubtedly a treasure of the Xuanyellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Once he refined it, countless secrets hidden in the Xuanyellow Realm would be laid bare before Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>He might even be able to ascend in one step and achieve immortality.</p><p></p><p>However, it was indeed a form of immortality deeply tied to the Xuanyellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Fan was well aware of the pain the senior endured, even death seemed like a kind of relief in comparison...</p><p></p><p>When the time came, "he really wasn't willing."</p><p></p><p>Forever carrying the stone tablet...</p><p></p><p>"From the experience of confronting Mr. Tian Dao Bai, the influence on the mind, even the body double cannot escape."</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to find a suitable candidate to inherit this Creation Stone Tablet."</p><p></p><p>"This individual must have a strong enough spirit to not go mad on the spot and at least be usable for me..."</p><p></p><p>The figures of various cultivators flashed through Li Fan's mind rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Li Fan knew he didn't have much time left.</p><p></p><p>As the world rewove the Creation Stone Tablet, like a fruit growing on a tree.</p><p></p><p>When the Creation Stone Tablet was completely formed, it would be the moment the fruit fell.</p><p></p><p>It would probably return to a certain place in the Xuanyellow Realm, difficult to find again.</p><p></p><p>"It's him."</p><p></p><p>Li Fan finally decided on the target candidate and then cloaked himself in a colorful divine light, transforming into a rainbow and heading towards the Sea of Clouds.</p><p></p><p>In no time, he found the target cultivator.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than Sima Changkong, who traced his own family bloodline, recording the history of the Xuanyellow Realm!</p><p></p><p>In this life, Sima Changkong had no association with Li Fan, so his sudden visit left Sima Changkong feeling bewildered.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fan wasn't there to seek his opinion.</p><p></p><p>Without a word, he instantly suppressed Sima Changkong. Then, he hurriedly brought him back to the small temple in Yongyun State.</p><p></p><p>On the way, he recounted the whole story of what had happened.</p><p></p><p>"Now, there is an opportunity for you to comprehensively grasp the past of the Xuanyellow Realm. Are you willing to accept it?" Li Fan asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, Sima Changkong, who felt it was his duty to record the history of the Xuanyellow Realm through generations, had no reason to refuse such an offer.</p><p></p><p>Everything happening in the Xuanyellow Realm would forever appear in his mind...</p><p></p><p>For Sima Changkong, this was not a hardship at all!</p><p></p><p>It was almost a perfect ability that the Sima family members dreamt of!</p><p></p><p>At least, before truly absorbing the stone tablet, this is what Sima Changkong thought.</p><p></p><p>"Recording the history of the Xuanyellow Realm, who else but me!"</p><p></p><p>"I hope the Taoist friend will fulfill my wish!"</p><p></p><p>After taking a deep breath, Sima Changkong respectfully bowed to Li Fan.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know how the other party knew his identity, if what he said was true...</p><p></p><p>Sima Changkong was willing to put everything into it!</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Li Fan replied solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait for the right moment!"</p><p></p><p>Seven days later, just before the Creation Stone Tablet was about to be fully formed, Li Fan lightly shouted and instantly used the technique of "Drawing Threads" on Sima Changkong.</p>

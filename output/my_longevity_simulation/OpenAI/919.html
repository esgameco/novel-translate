            <p>However, he didn't even glance at the cultivators below.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he gestured and regained control of the thousands of sword formations that had lost their pursuit targets.</p><p></p><p>Then he raised his head and looked towards the higher sky, saying, "I have a sword, please witness it, Celestial!"</p><p></p><p>His clear voice spread across the wilderness from the high sky, causing the cultivators from the Yilvzhou to look at each other in shock.</p><p></p><p>"What is he trying to do?"</p><p></p><p>"Bold, speaking disrespectfully to Celestial Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"Quickly stop him!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The reacting cultivators' exclamations echoed one after another, but it was already too late!</p><p></p><p>Behind Li Qing, the shadow of a black sword suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>The moment it appeared, those myriad sword formations, as if stimulated by something fierce, surged multiple times.</p><p></p><p>The sword lights soared violently, several times brighter than before.</p><p></p><p>The intensity of the light was so dazzling that the cultivators below could hardly open their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Even Wan Zailai, who was already defeated and at a loss, lifted his head at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his own move, which could be further enhanced to such an extent, a glimmer of hope suddenly rose in Wan Zailai's originally dim eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing, however, paid no attention to the reactions of the cultivators below.</p><p></p><p>With a long laugh, his figure merged into the shadow of the black sword.</p><p></p><p>Within the embrace of the thousands of sword formations, like an emperor of swords leading a grand army, cutting through the sky.</p><p></p><p>Directly thrusting towards the sky!</p><p></p><p>The transparent circular martial arena only blocked for a moment, shattered under this earth-shattering strike.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the diminishing force of the sword lights, as if wanting to split the entire sky open.</p><p></p><p>In the clash between the sword and the sky, those sword lights burst open like fireworks, scattering and illuminating the colorful sky.</p><p></p><p>Only the black sword incarnated by Li Qing remained firm and steadfast.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it suddenly appeared in a magnificent scene within the sky.</p><p></p><p>In that fleeting crack, one could vaguely see many different figures, all staring at the intruding black sword together.</p><p></p><p>Their faces displayed various expressions.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Ah, this kid is really pitiful. So young but..."</p><p></p><p>"It's such a waste of this good appearance."</p><p></p><p>"It's his own fault for being persistent with Zhao Shijie. Zhao Shijie has already reached the foundation-building stage not long ago and is about to become a core disciple. This kid still hasn't succeeded in Qi cultivation..."</p><p></p><p>"The audacity, he dares to disrespect Celestial Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that he has repeatedly rejected Zhao Shijie's goodwill and even suggested to meet less in the future. It was Zhao Shijie who persistently sought him out every time..."</p><p></p><p>"It's impossible! Absolutely impossible!"</p><p></p><p>The discussions in his ears woke Li Qing up.</p><p></p><p>The people around saw Li Qing wake up and quickly shut their mouths, leaving the room.</p><p></p><p>Leaving only him in silence.</p><p></p><p>In his confused mind, it took a while for Li Qing to understand the current situation.</p><p></p><p>He was originally from the Longfeng Village in the Daqing Mountains.</p><p></p><p>Half a year ago, Longfeng Village was massacred by a group of bandits, but only he and Zhao Ruoxi from the village were out playing, so they escaped unharmed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the flames rising in the village, they hurried back.</p><p></p><p>But they happened to run into the retreating bandits.</p><p></p><p>The bandits were all attracted by Zhao Ruoxi's beauty, preparing to plunder her. Fortunately, a Daoist master descended from the sky and killed all the evil bandits.</p><p></p><p>Then they were taken back to the gate of the Daodao Sect, the only survivors.</p><p></p><p>As a mere mortal, he was fortunate to step onto the immortal path. It could be said that he was lucky enough to make up for the disaster.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Fanqing's luck was obviously not deep enough, at least compared to Zhao Ruoxi, it was like a world of difference.</p><p></p><p>Half a year later, she had successfully established her foundation.</p><p></p><p>She worshipped Zhang Wangshuang, the god of the Moon Splendour Sect.</p><p></p><p>While Li Qing, still lingered in the Qi cultivation period.</p><p></p><p>The gap was not small.</p><p></p><p>What was most unacceptable for Li Qing was...</p><p></p><p>Feeling the immense pain from below, Li Qing's heart was like dead ashes.</p><p></p><p>All of this was because of the disaster caused by a woman!</p><p></p><p>Even the Qin Shou from the Mountain line fell in love with Zhao Ruoxi at first sight. However, due to the huge gap in their cultivation and status, Qin Shou relentlessly pursued Zhao Ruoxi.</p><p></p><p>However, the falling flowers showed their intentions while the river remained indifferent; Zhao Ruoxi didn't pay him any attention.</p><p></p><p>However, she had already secretly promised her heart to Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>Not only did she visit Li Qing whenever she had the chance but also secretly brought him many elixirs, among which was an extremely precious Foundation-Building Elixir!</p><p></p><p>This Foundation-Building Elixir was no ordinary product; it was the "Purple Melody Refining Dao Elixir" that Zhao Ruoxi knew Li Qing had poor aptitude, and specially asked her master for. Not only did it greatly reduce the side effects of forcefully breaking through with elixirs, but it also slightly improved the cultivator's aptitude.</p><p></p><p>It was truly a miraculous elixir that could change fate!</p><p></p><p>That day, after sending Zhao Ruoxi away, Li Qing looked at the divine elixir in his arms, filled with joy.</p><p></p><p>Who would have expected joy to turn into sorrow?</p><p></p><p>His overly close relationship with Zhao Ruoxi caused dissatisfaction from Qin Shou.</p><p></p><p>He even directly sent people to teach Li Qing a lesson. The group acted ruthlessly, directly crippling Li Qing's vitality. Then they searched and took away the Purple Melody Refining Dao Elixir.</p><p></p><p>"Qin Shou..."</p><p></p><p>As Li Qing slowly woke up from his memories, a look of endless hatred flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the painful sensation from his lower body made him return to reality.</p><p></p><p>Summoning his courage, Li Qing trembled as he extended his hand to touch his lower body.</p><p></p><p>But he grabbed nothing but air.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's heart turned cold in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"No vitality means no hope of breaking through the Qi cultivation period."</p><p></p><p>"What's the point of living..."</p><p></p><p>Despair filled Li Qing's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a figure suddenly entered the room.</p><p></p><p>Without looking up, Li Qing knew who it was from the familiar scent alone.</p><p></p><p>Mid-sentence, Li Qing suddenly remembered the warning from those villains when they attacked. The piercing pain in his lower body hadn't subsided yet.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing couldn't help but shiver, changing his words, "Zhao Shijie..."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ruoxi looked at Li Qing's appearance, her eyes first showing a hint of pain.</p><p></p><p>But then her expression turned dark, full of solemn killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Where are you injured?" she asked softly.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing trembled again, subconsciously blocking his crotch.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ruoxi came to the realization instantly, her face turning pale.</p><p></p><p>Her spiritual knowledge swept over, her small fist clenched tightly. The immense killing intent surged in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>The flaw was completely exposed, and Li Qing instantly gave up hope of survival.</p><p></p><p>However, due to overwhelming shame, apart from trembling all over, he couldn't do anything else.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Qing trembling like a little chick, Zhao Ruoxi's heart was filled with pity.</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, it's okay."</p><p></p><p>She comforted him while embracing Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a physical injury. When your cultivation advances in the future, you might be able to reshape your body..."</p><p></p><p>"Sister, even though my cultivation is not as good as yours, I still have common sense in cultivation. I'm still in the Qi cultivation stage and already have a physical defect. This is a congenital defect..."</p><p></p><p>"Even if I reach the Nascent Soul stage, it may not be easy to make up for it. Moreover, given my talent, there's no hope of reaching the Nascent Soul stage..."</p><p></p><p>The more Li Qing spoke, the more despair he felt, bursting into tears uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>In the end, under the double blow of physical and mental pain, he fell asleep in Zhao Shijie's arms.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ruoxi watched Li Qing, with tears on his face, originally filled with heartache.</p><p></p><p>But as she gently wiped the tears away from his face, watching his handsome face frowning even in his sleep, she seemed to become a little absent-minded.</p><p></p><p>Then, Zhao Ruoxi's expression became somewhat strange.</p><p></p><p>After gently laying Li Qing down and covering him with a blanket, Zhao Ruoxi appeared to be making a difficult decision. Her face was tangled as she paced back and forth in the room.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, she finally made up her mind.</p><p></p><p>When Li Qing awoke from his daze once again, he didn't get up immediately.</p><p></p><p>Instead, his eyes were dull, staring at the ceiling. His mind was blank.</p><p></p><p>"Living like this is really meaningless. I might as well die."</p><p></p><p>Just as he was thinking of ways to end his life in his mind...</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ruoxi walked in again.</p><p></p><p>With a strong hint of blood.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>She threw the tangled heads of five people in front of Li Qing: "I've already killed all the assailants from that day!"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I know they were only following orders."</p><p></p><p>"The mastermind behind it is Qin Shou from the Lianshan line."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this name, a glimmer of light flashed in Li Qing's originally lifeless eyes.</p><p></p><p>"But I can't move against him now. Not only is Qin Shou stronger than me, but the force behind him is also beyond my reach for the time being."</p><p></p><p>"But I promise you, one day. I will repay Qin Shou for the pain he inflicted on you a thousandfold." Zhao Ruoxi said softly, her tone resolute.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing just nodded slightly, not saying a word.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I specially found a cultivation method for you."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Qing's lack of enthusiasm, Zhao Shijie took out a jade slip and handed it to him.</p><p></p><p>"A cultivation method?"</p><p></p><p>At first, Li Qing was a little resistant, unwilling to reach out to take it.</p><p></p><p>But upon hearing Zhao Ruoxi say that this method was particularly suitable for him, Li Qing hesitated for a moment before taking it and reading.</p><p></p><p>"The Reverse Doctrine?"</p><p></p><p>At first, Li Qing was a bit listless, but when he read the part in the method that said, "To practice this technique, you must first castrate yourself," he was shaken to the core.</p><p></p><p>He looked up suddenly at Zhao Ruoxi.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ruoxi explained softly, "This is a cultivation method hidden in the secret pavilion of the Daodao Sect. Its origins are unknown, as the prerequired conditions for practicing it are too harsh, so few have sought it over the years."</p><p></p><p>"I almost searched through the entire secret pavilion to find this method that is most suitable for you."</p><p></p><p>As if ignited with hope, Li Qing eagerly continued reading the content that followed in the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"Endless heaven and earth, orderly universe, Yin and Yang have a way."</p><p></p><p>"This is the principle of nature."</p><p></p><p>"But by going against Yin and Yang, one can seize the power of creation and become a true immortal!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just from the introduction, Li Qing's mind was deeply captivated.</p><p></p><p>Forget about everything around him; he was completely immersed in this extremely mysterious cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>"To reach the realm of true immortality..."</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, even if I have to castrate myself, it's not a big deal."</p><p></p><p>After roughly reading through it, Li Qing couldn't help but think in this way.</p><p></p><p>-----------------</p>
